The Division consisted of four [[light cruiser]]s: {{USS|Biloxi|CL-80|6}}, {{USS|Birmingham|CL-62|2}}, {{USS|Mobile|CL-63|2}}, and {{USS|Santa Fe|CL-60|2}}.\n\nFrom 24 March to 4 May 1945, Task Force 54 under the command of Rear Adm. Deyo commanded battleships, cruisers and destroyers in the bombardment of [[Kerama Islands|Kerama Retto]] and the southeast coast of Okinawa, Japan.<ref>Crossman, op.cit., p.305</ref> \nFollowing the war, he directed the landing of occupation forces in Northern Japan.<ref>USS ''Deyo'' webpage, op.cit.</ref>\n\n==Cold War==\n\n[[File:USS Wasp (CV-18) at the Boston Navy Yard on 14 March 1944.jpg|thumb|right|100|<center>Commandant, First Naval District, 1946\u201349]]\n\nMorton Deyo's last duty station, from 1946 to 1949, was as Commandant of the [[First Naval District]], headquartered at the [[Boston Navy Yard]].  The First Naval District exercised administrative supervision of all Navy activities in the New England states, except for Connecticut.\n\nWorking out inter-service and inter-department conflicts was a serious goal for the U.S. Navy going into the [[Cold War]]. As of September 1945, the qualifications for a district commandant were those of a line officer eligible for command at sea, and the shipyard (specialist) commands were no longer to be held by the same officer. Deyo met the new qualification for District Commandant, and had served at Boston twice before as an instructor and aide to the Commandant during a time of reorganization. Inefficiency from command conflicts were taken under study even before the war ended by the \"Farber Committee\".\n\nThe main feature of reform related to the various types of authority over district activities. The Commandant was to have coordinating \"military command\" over all activities in the district akin to Army districts. The Navy Secretary directed satisfactory relationships.<ref>Department of the Navy \u2013 Naval Historical Center.

In retirement he lived at Hooke's Cove in [[Kittery, Maine|Kittery Point, Maine]].  In 1959 he was elected as an honorary member of the New Hampshire [[Society of the Cincinnati]].\n\nAdmiral Deyo died November 10, 1973 at his home in [[Kittery Point, Maine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usna.edu/cemetery/PDF%20Files/Section%206/1288A-%20Deyo,%20M.%20L.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927042311/http://www.usna.edu/cemetery/PDF%20Files/Section%206/1288A-%20Deyo,%20M.%20L.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Namesake==\n\nThe destroyer {{USS|Deyo|DD-989}} was the 27th {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|1}} and the first ship to be named to honor Vice Admiral Deyo.

It stars [[Owen Wilson]] and [[Jason Sudeikis]].\n\nRick and Fred, two husbands who are having difficulty in their marriages, are given [[wikt:hall pass|hall pass]]es by their wives: for one week, they are allowed to [[have sex]] with other women.\n\nIt was theatrically released on February 25, 2011. The film received mixed critical reviews and was a moderate box office success by grossing over $83 million.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=March 2014}}\n\nRick ([[Owen Wilson]]) and Fred ([[Jason Sudeikis]]) are best friends, as are their wives, Maggie ([[Jenna Fischer]]) and Grace ([[Christina Applegate]]). They are both unhappy with their married lives in the suburbs of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and missing the old days when they were single. Realizing this, their wives talk to their friend Dr. Lucy ([[Joy Behar]]) and decide to give them a \"hall pass\": a week off from marriage during which they can have sex with other women. They are skeptical at first, but ultimately accept the offers and try to pick up women with their friends Gary ([[Stephen Merchant]]), Flats ([[J. B. Smoove]]) and Hog Head ([[Larry Joe Campbell]]). Maggie and Grace spend Rick and Fred's \"Hall Pass Week\" at Maggie's parents' house in Cape Cod, where Grace flirts with athlete Gerry ([[Tyler Hoechlin]]). She says that if their husbands have Hall Passes, so should they.\n\nWith their wives and children away, Fred and Rick check in at a hotel and prepare for their Hall Pass Week. On day one, they decide to eat before going to a local bar and get too tired to spend the night there, preferring to stay at the hotel.\n\nOn day two, they eat [[hash brownie]]s and decide to play golf, but get too high and wreak havoc on the golf course.\n\nOn day three, Rick and Fred go to a bar with their friends but fail to impress the women there. They decide to get drunk in order to become more loose, but go too far and wind up getting into a fight with other customers. They spend day four at the hotel suffering from a hangover.\n\nOn day five, Rick goes to a local coffee shop where he flirts with an attractive waitress named Leigh ([[Nicky Whelan]]), much to the annoyance of her co-worker Brent who insults Rick. When Rick answers him back, Leigh is impressed and tells Rick that they might see each other at the local gym. They later meet there, and Leigh invites Rick for a beer after they work out. Rick decides to sit in the hot tub instead, but falls asleep and stays there for several hours, ending up with his muscles too weak to use and forced to accept the help of two naked men to leave - much to his dismay. Meanwhile, Grace and Gerry get closer, while Maggie finds herself attracted to Gerry's coach.\n\nOn day six, Rick and Fred go to a bar called Enter the Dragon with their friend Coakley ([[Richard Jenkins]]), where Rick meets his children's babysitter Paige ([[Alexandra Daddario]]), who has just turned 21 and is with her aunt Meg. Paige is attracted to Rick, but he shoots her down to dance with Leigh. Brent, the party's DJ, is angry at this. After the party is over, Rick goes to party at Coakley's while Fred takes a girl to his hotel room. However, she feels sick, and after a minor incident in the bathroom, is sent back home by Fred before they can have sex. Later that evening, Meg shows up at the room and mistakes Fred for Rick, eventually seducing him. Fred begins to fake oral sex on her.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerry's coach tries to seduce Maggie, but she rebuffs him. Grace, on the other hand, has sex with Gerry, but tells him it will be just that one time. On her way back home, she feels guilty about cheating on Fred and has a car accident.\n\nAt Coakley's house, Rick is approached by Brent, who is angry at Rick for going out with Leigh. Leigh calms Brent, then finds Rick alone in a bedroom and offers him a one-time fling. He initially wants to do it, but ultimately rebuffs her, unable to cheat on Maggie. After answering Fred's phone, Rick learns of Grace's accident and makes his way to the hotel to tell him. In the lobby he finds Paige, who thinks he was having sex with Meg. They enter the room and find Fred having fake sex with her. After finding out the truth, Meg kicks Fred in the face.\n\nUpon hearing about Grace's accident, Fred tries to go to the hospital but finds Brent vandalizing what he thought was Rick's car. Upon seeing Meg, his mother, at the hotel, Brent thinks Fred has had sex with her and tries to kill him as well, but runs out of bullets and is tackled by Paige and Meg. Rick and Fred make their way to the hospital with Brent and the police chasing them. At the hospital, Brent is arrested for attacking them and Fred finds out Grace only broke her nose.\n\nRick goes back home to Maggie. He tells her he did not use the Hall Pass and remembers the time he lost his virginity to her. She is the only woman he has ever been with. Moved by his declaration, Maggie tells him she did not use her Hall Pass either, and they reconcile and have sex for the first time in months.\n\nFred and Grace also reconcile and decide to hide their cheating from one another. However, Fred ultimately confesses that he used his Hall Pass with Meg when Grace asks him to take her to see Kathy Griffin.\n\nDuring the credits, Fred hosts a barbecue where he pays Kathy Griffin to be present. Noticing how happy Maggie and Grace are following the Hall Pass week, Gary's wife suggests that she give him a Hall Pass. After a fantasy where he sleeps with a married woman, resulting in the death of her, her husband, her grandmother and several innocent bystanders and ending with him being [[prison rape in the United States|raped in prison]], Gary agrees to \"give it a whirl\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Richard \"Rick\" Mills, Maggie's husband\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Fred Searing, Grace's husband\n* [[Jenna Fischer]] as Maggie Mills, Rick's wife\n* [[Christina Applegate]] as Grace Searing, Fred's wife\n* [[Joy Behar]] as Dr. Lucille \"Lucy\" Gilbert\n* [[Nicky Whelan]] as Leigh\n* [[Bruce Thomas (actor)|Bruce Thomas]] as Coach Rick Coleman\n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Paige\n* [[Alyssa Milano]] as Mandy Bohac\n* [[Derek Waters]] as Brent\n* Kristin Carey as Aunt Meg\n* [[Tyler Hoechlin]] as Gerry\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Gary Putney\n* [[J.

It stars [[Owen Wilson]] and [[Jason Sudeikis]].\n\nRick and Fred, two husbands who are having difficulty in their marriages, are given [[wikt:hall pass|hall pass]]es by their wives: for one week, they are allowed to [[have sex]] with other women.\n\nIt was theatrically released on February 25, 2011. The film received mixed critical reviews and was a moderate box office success by grossing over $83 million.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=March 2014}}\n\nRick ([[Owen Wilson]]) and Fred ([[Jason Sudeikis]]) are best friends, as are their wives, Maggie ([[Jenna Fischer]]) and Grace ([[Christina Applegate]]). They are both unhappy with their married lives in the suburbs of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and missing the old days when they were single. Realizing this, their wives talk to their friend Dr. Lucy ([[Joy Behar]]) and decide to give them a \"hall pass\": a week off from marriage during which they can have sex with other women. They are skeptical at first, but ultimately accept the offers and try to pick up women with their friends Gary ([[Stephen Merchant]]), Flats ([[J. B. Smoove]]) and Hog Head ([[Larry Joe Campbell]]). Maggie and Grace spend Rick and Fred's \"Hall Pass Week\" at Maggie's parents' house in Cape Cod, where Grace flirts with athlete Gerry ([[Tyler Hoechlin]]). She says that if their husbands have Hall Passes, so should they.\n\nWith their wives and children away, Fred and Rick check in at a hotel and prepare for their Hall Pass Week. On day one, they decide to eat before going to a local bar and get too tired to spend the night there, preferring to stay at the hotel.\n\nOn day two, they eat [[hash brownie]]s and decide to play golf, but get too high and wreak havoc on the golf course.\n\nOn day three, Rick and Fred go to a bar with their friends but fail to impress the women there. They decide to get drunk in order to become more loose, but go too far and wind up getting into a fight with other customers. They spend day four at the hotel suffering from a hangover.\n\nOn day five, Rick goes to a local coffee shop where he flirts with an attractive waitress named Leigh ([[Nicky Whelan]]), much to the annoyance of her co-worker Brent who insults Rick. When Rick answers him back, Leigh is impressed and tells Rick that they might see each other at the local gym. They later meet there, and Leigh invites Rick for a beer after they work out. Rick decides to sit in the hot tub instead, but falls asleep and stays there for several hours, ending up with his muscles too weak to use and forced to accept the help of two naked men to leave - much to his dismay. Meanwhile, Grace and Gerry get closer, while Maggie finds herself attracted to Gerry's coach.\n\nOn day six, Rick and Fred go to a bar called Enter the Dragon with their friend Coakley ([[Richard Jenkins]]), where Rick meets his children's babysitter Paige ([[Alexandra Daddario]]), who has just turned 21 and is with her aunt Meg. Paige is attracted to Rick, but he shoots her down to dance with Leigh. Brent, the party's DJ, is angry at this. After the party is over, Rick goes to party at Coakley's while Fred takes a girl to his hotel room. However, she feels sick, and after a minor incident in the bathroom, is sent back home by Fred before they can have sex. Later that evening, Meg shows up at the room and mistakes Fred for Rick, eventually seducing him. Fred begins to fake oral sex on her.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerry's coach tries to seduce Maggie, but she rebuffs him. Grace, on the other hand, has sex with Gerry, but tells him it will be just that one time. On her way back home, she feels guilty about cheating on Fred and has a car accident.\n\nAt Coakley's house, Rick is approached by Brent, who is angry at Rick for going out with Leigh. Leigh calms Brent, then finds Rick alone in a bedroom and offers him a one-time fling. He initially wants to do it, but ultimately rebuffs her, unable to cheat on Maggie. After answering Fred's phone, Rick learns of Grace's accident and makes his way to the hotel to tell him. In the lobby he finds Paige, who thinks he was having sex with Meg. They enter the room and find Fred having fake sex with her. After finding out the truth, Meg kicks Fred in the face.\n\nUpon hearing about Grace's accident, Fred tries to go to the hospital but finds Brent vandalizing what he thought was Rick's car. Upon seeing Meg, his mother, at the hotel, Brent thinks Fred has had sex with her and tries to kill him as well, but runs out of bullets and is tackled by Paige and Meg. Rick and Fred make their way to the hospital with Brent and the police chasing them. At the hospital, Brent is arrested for attacking them and Fred finds out Grace only broke her nose.\n\nRick goes back home to Maggie. He tells her he did not use the Hall Pass and remembers the time he lost his virginity to her. She is the only woman he has ever been with. Moved by his declaration, Maggie tells him she did not use her Hall Pass either, and they reconcile and have sex for the first time in months.\n\nFred and Grace also reconcile and decide to hide their cheating from one another. However, Fred ultimately confesses that he used his Hall Pass with Meg when Grace asks him to take her to see Kathy Griffin.\n\nDuring the credits, Fred hosts a barbecue where he pays Kathy Griffin to be present. Noticing how happy Maggie and Grace are following the Hall Pass week, Gary's wife suggests that she give him a Hall Pass. After a fantasy where he sleeps with a married woman, resulting in the death of her, her husband, her grandmother and several innocent bystanders and ending with him being [[prison rape in the United States|raped in prison]], Gary agrees to \"give it a whirl\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Richard \"Rick\" Mills, Maggie's husband\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Fred Searing, Grace's husband\n* [[Jenna Fischer]] as Maggie Mills, Rick's wife\n* [[Christina Applegate]] as Grace Searing, Fred's wife\n* [[Joy Behar]] as Dr. Lucille \"Lucy\" Gilbert\n* [[Nicky Whelan]] as Leigh\n* [[Bruce Thomas (actor)|Bruce Thomas]] as Coach Rick Coleman\n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Paige\n* [[Alyssa Milano]] as Mandy Bohac\n* [[Derek Waters]] as Brent\n* Kristin Carey as Aunt Meg\n* [[Tyler Hoechlin]] as Gerry\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Gary Putney\n* [[J.

Dublin: G. Tyrrell, 1837. p. 49.</ref>]]\n'''Francis L'Estrange''' (c.1756 - 13 August 1836)\n\nF. L'Estrange was born about the year 1756 at Auburn (Boarstown), in [[County Westmeath]]. He was the youngest of the four sons of a country gentleman. The elder two died without issue; the third, a lieutenant-colonel, succeeded to the property, and Francis was educated as a surgeon. He began to practise in Chatham-street about 1778, and was in 1779 appointed Assistant-Surgeon to [[Mercer's Hospital]], of which institution he subsequently became surgeon. On the 12th June, 1786, he was appointed Assistant- Surgeon to the [[House of Industry]] Hospitals, and was for many years Surgeon to the Marine School. L'Estrange engaged in surgical and obstetrical practice. He acted as accoucheur at the birth of the poet, Thomas Moore, which event took place in Aungier-street on the 28th May, 1779.

The film was produced, written and directed by the [[Farrelly brothers]] and co-written by [[Mike Cerrone]].  It stars [[Chris Diamantopoulos]], [[Sean Hayes]], and [[Will Sasso]], re-creating the [[eponymous]] characters played by [[Moe Howard]], [[Larry Fine]], and [[Curly Howard]].\n\nThe film's story places the Stooges in a modern setting. After [[development hell|over a decade]] of casting problems, [[principal photography]] took place from May to July 2011. The film was released on April 13, 2012, by [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is composed of three acts, which are referred to as episodes (a reference to how the original ''Three Stooges'' short films were packaged for television by [[Columbia Pictures]]).\n\n===Act / Episode 1: More Orphan Than Not===\n35 years in the past, the children at the Sisters of Mercy Orphanage are playing soccer with an old soda can in the front yard. But then, Sister Mary-Mengele, the meanest and strictest nun in the [[orphanage]] gets their attention by telling them to go inside and do their work. Later, infant versions of Moe, Larry, and Curly are dumped on the doorstep of the orphanage from an unknown person's car. Ever since, the trio has wreaked havoc in the place, leaving the nuns who run it utterly terrified, especially Sister Mary-Mengele, who has always hated the trio.\n\nTen years later, out of desperation, when a prospective couple comes to adopt, the exasperated nuns bring out the trio as being the only three available, eventually being forced to add a fourth when another boy, Teddy, enters the picture. The couple, the Harters, decides to pick Moe, but when he requests Larry and Curly to join him, he is dropped back off at the orphanage, and they choose Teddy instead. When he goes back to the orphanage, Moe lies to Larry and Curly that the reason he came back is because the Harters were going to make him do chores.\n\n25 years later, in the present, the trio are adults, still living at the orphanage and working as maintenance men. [[Monsignor]] Ratliffe arrives to give everyone an important message. After Monsignor Ratliffe tells Mother Superior that the orphanage is going to close, she tells Sister Mary-Mengele to get the trio. As the three attempt to fix the bell on the roof, however, they accidentally injure Sister Mary-Mengele with it (as Larry misreads and removes the \"''DO NOT REMOVE''\" tag on the bell as \"Donut Remover\") when she came to tell them Mother Superior needs them. They head to Mother Superior until another one of their accidents causes Monsignor Ratliffe to fall on top of the nuns. Monsignor Ratliffe gets attacked by Moe, Larry, and Curly, who think that he was [[sexual assault|getting fresh]] with the nuns, until Mother Superior stops them.\n\nMother Superior announces to everyone that the orphanage will be forced to close down at the end of the month. Monsignor Ratliffe tells the nuns they will be spread around the diocese and the children will be sent to foster homes unless they can raise $830,000 in 30 days. The trio volunteers to go out and try to raise the money somehow. Some of the nuns think that they will not be able to succeed because they don\u2018t know anyone their age, only nuns and kids, but Mother Superior thinks otherwise.\n\n===Act / Episode 2: The Bananas Split===\nA [[subplot]] involves a woman named Lydia, who wants to kill her husband so she can be with her lover, Mac, and inherit her husband's considerable fortune. She finds the trio and offers to pay them the money they need to take care of the hit job. They botch the job by letting Curly push Mac (the supposed husband) in front of a bus and leave Mac in traction in the hospital. When they try to visit Mac in the hospital to finish the job (failing to do so as Mac told them that it has been finished already), they are chased by the cops throughout the hospital and escape by jumping off the roof using a fire hose. They end up running into a now grown-up Teddy, who invites them to his anniversary party and an opportunity to settle at Teddy's home, but Moe refuses.\n\nIt turns out that Teddy is actually Lydia's husband. Their next scheme for raising the money is selling [[Aquaculture of salmon|farm-raised salmon]], with them scattering salmon on a [[Golf course|golf range]] and watering them like [[Crop|produce]]. But the same cops from the hospital arrive at the golf course to arrest them and the trio gets chased off the golf course and they hide in an old building (getting in by using Curly as a [[battering ram]] to bust down the door). Inside, after having a slapstick fight, Larry and Curly scold Moe for rejecting Teddy's invitation and his father's earlier adoption attempt; they could have used his adoptive parents' wealth to help save the orphanage. Hurt, Moe tells them to leave, saying that he is tired of being with them. After deciding to split up, they leave the old building, with Moe left inside alone. Then it turns out that they were all on stage in front of an audition crew who select Moe to be the newest cast member of ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' as \"Dyna-Moe\".\n\n===Final Act / Episode 3: No Moe Mister Nice Guy===\nLarry and Curly are getting along well without Moe, but then they start to worry about him, and decide to return to the orphanage to find him. There, they find out a girl named Murph is very ill but has not been taken to the hospital because the orphanage has no medical insurance. Sister Mary-Mengele angrily tells them that no one will insure the orphanage due to the trio's numerous accidents and injuries over the years, and the $830,000 is needed in order to cover medical bills that accumulated over the years.\n\nLarry and Curly later meet up with Teddy's adopted father at his office to talk about what happened with the orphanage. Teddy's father confesses that Moe wanted him to go back for his friends to adopt them, and he thought three kids would be too many to handle, so he gave Moe back and took Teddy in his place. Then Larry and Curly discover a picture of Teddy and Mr. Harter with Lydia and Mac, and realize that Teddy is the husband that Lydia wanted to murder. In addition to this, they feel guilty for rebuking Moe in not accepting the Harter's adoption and decide to go find him.\n\nMeanwhile, Moe has been causing a lot of havoc on ''Jersey Shore'' by slapping, eye-poking and head-bopping the cast members and not putting up with their spoiled antics. The cast goes to the producer and tells him to kick Moe off of the show or they will sue him. The producer then informs them that the show is all about the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] and not them. Larry and Curly finally go to the set of ''Jersey Shore'' to reunite with Moe and they all head to the anniversary party where they show up to thwart the murder plot, getting in as balloon men.\n\nWhen they get inside, Curly gives all the balloons to a little girl and she floats up into the air. Later, they get chased by the angry Lydia and Mac after the same girl's balloons are popped and she falls onto the wedding cake, destroying it. Moe, Larry, and Curly are chased into Teddy's bedroom, finding Teddy on the bed, drowsy. Mac then draws a gun on the trio, but Mr. Harter appears and tells Mac to put his gun down. Mac then confesses that Lydia was \"calling the shots\", but Mr. Harter admits that he was the real [[wikt:mastermind|mastermind]] and Lydia was working for him. He married into the money and was incensed to find out the money was left to Teddy and not him when Teddy's mother died years earlier.\n\nThey are taken for a ride, but the car crashes into a lake when Curly's pet rat Nippy digs into Lydia\u2019s [[breasts]]. They all escape when Curly [[Flatulence|passes gas]], and they light it with some \"easy-light, waterproof safety matches\" that Larry had, causing enough of an [[explosion]] to blow out the windows. Once they are back on land, Mr. Harter, Lydia, and Mac are arrested, and Teddy thanks the trio for saving him. When the trio requests the $830,000 from Teddy, he declines, stating he refuses to help the same orphanage that gave him up to a father that tried to kill him.\n\nA couple months later, the trio return to the now-condemned/abandoned orphanage. They feel bad for feeling like failures, but then they hear kids laughing, swimming and playing. When they investigate, they find out a brand new orphanage was built next door, complete with a swimming pool, a basketball court, and a tennis court. They soon learn that the money came from the ''Jersey Shore'''s producers who consider this as an advance payment in relation to a new reality show, ''Nuns vs. Nitwits'', in which the entire trio will take part.\n\nMurph is revealed to be perfectly fine and her illness was due to metal poisoning (with Larry saying he has always suspected there was too much iron in the water.) Then she, along with her friends, brothers Peezer and Weezer (the latter thought to have been lost forever to a foster home), will be adopted by Teddy and his new fianc\u00e9e, Ling, who was Teddy's father's secretary. In the end, after causing one more incident (namely Curly accidentally knocking Sister Mary-Mengele into the pool with a folded-up diving board), the trio run away, bounce off some trampolines over the hedge and onto some mules, on which they clumsily ride away into the distance.\n\n===Post-script epilogue===\nAn [[epilogue]] consists of two actors playing [[Farrelly brothers|Bobby and Peter Farrelly]], explaining that the stunts were all done by professionals, showing the foam rubber props used in the film for the trio to hit one another, demonstrating the fake eye-poke trick (to the eyebrows), and advising children not to try any of the stunts at home.\n\nDuring the end credits, a music video plays showing the Stooges and Sister Rosemary performing \"[[It's a Shame (The Spinners song)|It's a Shame]]\", originally recorded by [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|The Spinners]] in 1970, interspersed with excerpts from [[deleted scene]]s and a couple of brief [[outtake]]s. Though credited to \"The Spinners and The Three Stooges\", Hudson's own distinctive vocals can also be heard.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Diamantopoulos]] as [[Moe Howard|Moe]], the aggressive and short-tempered leader of the Stooges.\n** [[Skyler Gisondo]] as young Moe\n* [[Sean Hayes]] as [[Larry Fine|Larry]], the smartest and most relaxed member of the Stooges.\n** Lance Chantiles-Wertz as young Larry\n* [[Will Sasso]] as [[Curly Howard|Curly]], the goofy and dim-witted member of the Stooges.\n** [[Robert Capron]] as young Curly\n* [[Jane Lynch]] as Mother Superior, the head nun of the orphanage the Stooges grew up in.\n* [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]] as Lydia Harter who was Teddy's wife that wanted to exploit the stooges.

Today, it specializes in crudity and trashes Christianity, especially Catholicism.\" Donohue added that the movie \"is not just another remake: it is a cultural marker of sociological significance, and what it says about the way we've changed is not encouraging.\"<ref name=catholic/>\n\nDonohue pinpoints one scene in which the film pushes the envelope with its portrayals of two unusual nuns, portrayed by the swimsuit model [[Kate Upton]], and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' creator [[Larry David]]. Both are potential causes for the offense for different reasons, as [[Moviefone]] reports:\n\n{{quote|In ''Stooges'', David portrays Sister Mary-Mengele. The name is a nod to the late [[Nazi]] [[Josef Mengele]], an SS Officer who decided the prisoners' fates at [[Auschwitz]]. As for Upton, it's not so much her character's name\u2014Sister Bernice\u2014as it is her attire. During one scene, the ''[[Sports Illustrated|SI]]'' swimsuit model dons a very revealing bikini along with a large rosary around her neck.<ref name=\"mf\"/>}}\n\nTo resolve the issue, the Farelly brothers reshot the scene with Larry pointing out Sister Bernice, still wearing the \"nun-kini\" while on lifeguard duty at the new orphanage's pool.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Close-up footage of Upton exiting the pool in front of a group of children appears in the film's trailer, but not in the movie itself nor DVD/Blu-ray deleted scenes; in the final film, she is only seen sitting in a chair and briefly in the background of a group shot while in her swimsuit (in her other scenes, she is dressed in standard nun attire).\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n\nThe cast of ''Jersey Shore'' were each nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Combo|Worst Screen Couple]] for their work on the film, but lost to [[Mackenzie Foy]] and [[Taylor Lautner]] for ''[[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2]]''.\n\nThe film received a nomination for worst film of the year by the [[Houston Film Critics Society]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2012 Houston Film Critics Nominees - Winners|url=http://texasartfilm.com/2012hfcsnominations.html|publisher=Texasartfilm.com|accessdate=January 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321230150/http://texasartfilm.com/2012hfcsnominations.html|archivedate=March 21, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n''The Three Stooges'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on July 17, 2012.

The film was produced, written and directed by the [[Farrelly brothers]] and co-written by [[Mike Cerrone]].  It stars [[Chris Diamantopoulos]], [[Sean Hayes]], and [[Will Sasso]], re-creating the [[eponymous]] characters played by [[Moe Howard]], [[Larry Fine]], and [[Curly Howard]].\n\nThe film's story places the Stooges in a modern setting. After [[development hell|over a decade]] of casting problems, [[principal photography]] took place from May to July 2011. The film was released on April 13, 2012, by [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is composed of three acts, which are referred to as episodes (a reference to how the original ''Three Stooges'' short films were packaged for television by [[Columbia Pictures]]).\n\n===Act / Episode 1: More Orphan Than Not===\n35 years in the past, the children at the Sisters of Mercy Orphanage are playing soccer with an old soda can in the front yard. But then, Sister Mary-Mengele, the meanest and strictest nun in the [[orphanage]] gets their attention by telling them to go inside and do their work. Later, infant versions of Moe, Larry, and Curly are dumped on the doorstep of the orphanage from an unknown person's car. Ever since, the trio has wreaked havoc in the place, leaving the nuns who run it utterly terrified, especially Sister Mary-Mengele, who has always hated the trio.\n\nTen years later, out of desperation, when a prospective couple comes to adopt, the exasperated nuns bring out the trio as being the only three available, eventually being forced to add a fourth when another boy, Teddy, enters the picture. The couple, the Harters, decides to pick Moe, but when he requests Larry and Curly to join him, he is dropped back off at the orphanage, and they choose Teddy instead. When he goes back to the orphanage, Moe lies to Larry and Curly that the reason he came back is because the Harters were going to make him do chores.\n\n25 years later, in the present, the trio are adults, still living at the orphanage and working as maintenance men. [[Monsignor]] Ratliffe arrives to give everyone an important message. After Monsignor Ratliffe tells Mother Superior that the orphanage is going to close, she tells Sister Mary-Mengele to get the trio. As the three attempt to fix the bell on the roof, however, they accidentally injure Sister Mary-Mengele with it (as Larry misreads and removes the \"''DO NOT REMOVE''\" tag on the bell as \"Donut Remover\") when she came to tell them Mother Superior needs them. They head to Mother Superior until another one of their accidents causes Monsignor Ratliffe to fall on top of the nuns. Monsignor Ratliffe gets attacked by Moe, Larry, and Curly, who think that he was [[sexual assault|getting fresh]] with the nuns, until Mother Superior stops them.\n\nMother Superior announces to everyone that the orphanage will be forced to close down at the end of the month. Monsignor Ratliffe tells the nuns they will be spread around the diocese and the children will be sent to foster homes unless they can raise $830,000 in 30 days. The trio volunteers to go out and try to raise the money somehow. Some of the nuns think that they will not be able to succeed because they don\u2018t know anyone their age, only nuns and kids, but Mother Superior thinks otherwise.\n\n===Act / Episode 2: The Bananas Split===\nA [[subplot]] involves a woman named Lydia, who wants to kill her husband so she can be with her lover, Mac, and inherit her husband's considerable fortune. She finds the trio and offers to pay them the money they need to take care of the hit job. They botch the job by letting Curly push Mac (the supposed husband) in front of a bus and leave Mac in traction in the hospital. When they try to visit Mac in the hospital to finish the job (failing to do so as Mac told them that it has been finished already), they are chased by the cops throughout the hospital and escape by jumping off the roof using a fire hose. They end up running into a now grown-up Teddy, who invites them to his anniversary party and an opportunity to settle at Teddy's home, but Moe refuses.\n\nIt turns out that Teddy is actually Lydia's husband. Their next scheme for raising the money is selling [[Aquaculture of salmon|farm-raised salmon]], with them scattering salmon on a [[Golf course|golf range]] and watering them like [[Crop|produce]]. But the same cops from the hospital arrive at the golf course to arrest them and the trio gets chased off the golf course and they hide in an old building (getting in by using Curly as a [[battering ram]] to bust down the door). Inside, after having a slapstick fight, Larry and Curly scold Moe for rejecting Teddy's invitation and his father's earlier adoption attempt; they could have used his adoptive parents' wealth to help save the orphanage. Hurt, Moe tells them to leave, saying that he is tired of being with them. After deciding to split up, they leave the old building, with Moe left inside alone. Then it turns out that they were all on stage in front of an audition crew who select Moe to be the newest cast member of ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' as \"Dyna-Moe\".\n\n===Final Act / Episode 3: No Moe Mister Nice Guy===\nLarry and Curly are getting along well without Moe, but then they start to worry about him, and decide to return to the orphanage to find him. There, they find out a girl named Murph is very ill but has not been taken to the hospital because the orphanage has no medical insurance. Sister Mary-Mengele angrily tells them that no one will insure the orphanage due to the trio's numerous accidents and injuries over the years, and the $830,000 is needed in order to cover medical bills that accumulated over the years.\n\nLarry and Curly later meet up with Teddy's adopted father at his office to talk about what happened with the orphanage. Teddy's father confesses that Moe wanted him to go back for his friends to adopt them, and he thought three kids would be too many to handle, so he gave Moe back and took Teddy in his place. Then Larry and Curly discover a picture of Teddy and Mr. Harter with Lydia and Mac, and realize that Teddy is the husband that Lydia wanted to murder. In addition to this, they feel guilty for rebuking Moe in not accepting the Harter's adoption and decide to go find him.\n\nMeanwhile, Moe has been causing a lot of havoc on ''Jersey Shore'' by slapping, eye-poking and head-bopping the cast members and not putting up with their spoiled antics. The cast goes to the producer and tells him to kick Moe off of the show or they will sue him. The producer then informs them that the show is all about the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] and not them. Larry and Curly finally go to the set of ''Jersey Shore'' to reunite with Moe and they all head to the anniversary party where they show up to thwart the murder plot, getting in as balloon men.\n\nWhen they get inside, Curly gives all the balloons to a little girl and she floats up into the air. Later, they get chased by the angry Lydia and Mac after the same girl's balloons are popped and she falls onto the wedding cake, destroying it. Moe, Larry, and Curly are chased into Teddy's bedroom, finding Teddy on the bed, drowsy. Mac then draws a gun on the trio, but Mr. Harter appears and tells Mac to put his gun down. Mac then confesses that Lydia was \"calling the shots\", but Mr. Harter admits that he was the real [[wikt:mastermind|mastermind]] and Lydia was working for him. He married into the money and was incensed to find out the money was left to Teddy and not him when Teddy's mother died years earlier.\n\nThey are taken for a ride, but the car crashes into a lake when Curly's pet rat Nippy digs into Lydia\u2019s [[breasts]]. They all escape when Curly [[Flatulence|passes gas]], and they light it with some \"easy-light, waterproof safety matches\" that Larry had, causing enough of an [[explosion]] to blow out the windows. Once they are back on land, Mr. Harter, Lydia, and Mac are arrested, and Teddy thanks the trio for saving him. When the trio requests the $830,000 from Teddy, he declines, stating he refuses to help the same orphanage that gave him up to a father that tried to kill him.\n\nA couple months later, the trio return to the now-condemned/abandoned orphanage. They feel bad for feeling like failures, but then they hear kids laughing, swimming and playing. When they investigate, they find out a brand new orphanage was built next door, complete with a swimming pool, a basketball court, and a tennis court. They soon learn that the money came from the ''Jersey Shore'''s producers who consider this as an advance payment in relation to a new reality show, ''Nuns vs. Nitwits'', in which the entire trio will take part.\n\nMurph is revealed to be perfectly fine and her illness was due to metal poisoning (with Larry saying he has always suspected there was too much iron in the water.) Then she, along with her friends, brothers Peezer and Weezer (the latter thought to have been lost forever to a foster home), will be adopted by Teddy and his new fianc\u00e9e, Ling, who was Teddy's father's secretary. In the end, after causing one more incident (namely Curly accidentally knocking Sister Mary-Mengele into the pool with a folded-up diving board), the trio run away, bounce off some trampolines over the hedge and onto some mules, on which they clumsily ride away into the distance.\n\n===Post-script epilogue===\nAn [[epilogue]] consists of two actors playing [[Farrelly brothers|Bobby and Peter Farrelly]], explaining that the stunts were all done by professionals, showing the foam rubber props used in the film for the trio to hit one another, demonstrating the fake eye-poke trick (to the eyebrows), and advising children not to try any of the stunts at home.\n\nDuring the end credits, a music video plays showing the Stooges and Sister Rosemary performing \"[[It's a Shame (The Spinners song)|It's a Shame]]\", originally recorded by [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|The Spinners]] in 1970, interspersed with excerpts from [[deleted scene]]s and a couple of brief [[outtake]]s. Though credited to \"The Spinners and The Three Stooges\", Hudson's own distinctive vocals can also be heard.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Diamantopoulos]] as [[Moe Howard|Moe]], the aggressive and short-tempered leader of the Stooges.\n** [[Skyler Gisondo]] as young Moe\n* [[Sean Hayes]] as [[Larry Fine|Larry]], the smartest and most relaxed member of the Stooges.\n** Lance Chantiles-Wertz as young Larry\n* [[Will Sasso]] as [[Curly Howard|Curly]], the goofy and dim-witted member of the Stooges.\n** [[Robert Capron]] as young Curly\n* [[Jane Lynch]] as Mother Superior, the head nun of the orphanage the Stooges grew up in.\n* [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]] as Lydia Harter who was Teddy's wife that wanted to exploit the stooges.

Today, it specializes in crudity and trashes Christianity, especially Catholicism.\" Donohue added that the movie \"is not just another remake: it is a cultural marker of sociological significance, and what it says about the way we've changed is not encouraging.\"<ref name=catholic/>\n\nDonohue pinpoints one scene in which the film pushes the envelope with its portrayals of two unusual nuns, portrayed by the swimsuit model [[Kate Upton]], and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' creator [[Larry David]]. Both are potential causes for the offense for different reasons, as [[Moviefone]] reports:\n\n{{quote|In ''Stooges'', David portrays Sister Mary-Mengele. The name is a nod to the late [[Nazi]] [[Josef Mengele]], an SS Officer who decided the prisoners' fates at [[Auschwitz]].

When they do so, Mone's condescending, humiliating attitude toward Schraeder angers him to the point that, after agreeing to make the film \"the biggest film since ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]''\", he confronts Mone in the parking lot with a gun and tries to make him perform fellatio on the security guard (Wessler had gotten on the lot by doing the same thing) and kill him if he does not make the film. Wessler tries to calm Schraeder down with more story ideas to no avail, but Mone pulls out a gun and shoots Schraeder to death. The segment ends with it being revealed that it is being shot by a camera crew as part of the movie, leading into the final segments.\n\n;Cast\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Charlie Wessler\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Griffin Schraeder\n* [[Common (entertainer)|Common]] as Bob Mone\n* [[Charlie Saxton]] as Jay\n* [[Will Sasso]] as Jerry\n* Odessa Rae as Danita\n* [[Seth MacFarlane]] as himself\n* Mike Meldman as himself\n\n===Alternative version (The Thread)===\n* Directed by [[Steven Brill (scriptwriter)|Steven Brill]] and written by Rocky Russo and Jeremy Sosenko\n\nThe structure of the film released in some countries, like the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, differs.

J. make a video in the style of [[MTV]]'s ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' and upload it on [[YouTube]] where it instantly reaches over 1,000,000 views. This turns out to be an [[April Fool's|April Fool's prank]] from Calvin's younger brother Baxter, who cloned YouTube and hyper-inflated the views while working on his science project. Calvin and J.J. attempt to get revenge. They tell Baxter of a film that's so dangerous it will cause the annihilation of the world. The movie is known as Movie 43. While J.J. and Baxter look for Movie 43 on a [[Google]] standin, Calvin retrieves Baxter's laptop and loads it with [[Computer viruses|viruses]] from porn sites, and masturbates to a strip tease video on the porn sites in a bathroom. Baxter finds hundreds of results for Movie 43 on a website referred to by him as a dark corner of the [[Internet]]. They find the sketches starting from the 43rd search on the list of results. As he and J.J. keep watching videos, they are interrupted by a man known as Vrankovich and a group of Chinese mobsters who are tempted to find Movie 43, even going as far as to take J.J.'s classmate Stevie Schraeder, film executive Griffin Schraeder's oldest son, hostage. Vrankovich warns them that if they find Movie 43, civilization will be destroyed. They ignore his claims and keep searching. They eventually find the real, the one and only ''Movie 43'', which turns out to be from the future. It shows Baxter as a profane commando who leads a group of recruits to survive after the world has ended. As Calvin finishes ruining Baxter's laptop, their mother enters, wearing the same shirt and shorts that the woman in the strip tease video wore, causing Calvin to have a mental breakdown after realizing that he had masturbated to a video of his mother. Afterward, a deadly [[earthquake]] rumbles and mankind is lost. However, a few years later the only survivor, a crippled Calvin, finds Baxter's laptop still working despite viral infections.

When the two arrive together at a restaurant, Beth is shocked when he removes his scarf, revealing a pair of [[testicle]]s dangling from his neck. Over dinner it confuses her that Davis fails to acknowledge his anatomical abnormality, and that nobody seems to be surprised by it. When two friends of Davis come by, one of them convinces him to give Beth a kiss. Davis agrees, but when he kisses her on the forehead, his neck-testicles are dangling near Beth's mouth, causing her to scream and budge out of the kiss.\n\n;Cast\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as Davis\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Beth\n* Roy Jenkins as Ray\n* Rocky Russo as Waiter Jake\n* Anna Madigan as Abby\n* [[Julie Claire]] as Pam\n* [[Katie Finneran]] as Angie\n\n====Homeschooled====\n* Directed by Will Graham and written by Will Graham & Jack Kukoda\n\nHaving recently moved, Sean and Clare have coffee with their new neighbors. The neighbors, Robert and Samantha have a teenage son, Kevin, whom they have home-schooled. Sean and Clare begin inquiring about the homeschooling, and the numerous manners in which Robert and Samantha have replicated a full high school experience within their home, going as far as hazing, bullying, ostracizing and giving out detentions, are revealed. They believe the experience should be as awkward as possible, like \"real high school\". This includes throwing parties that exclude Kevin, Samantha instigating Kevin's \"first kiss\" and Robert revealing romantic feelings for Kevin.

Urged by his best friend Larry and others to go along with it, he eats a large meal and drinks a bottle of laxative prior to the event. Wanting foreplay, Julie is angered when Doug wants to finish, and she runs into the street. Chasing after her, he is then hit by a car and graphically evacuates his bowels everywhere.

When they begin to kiss, his older brother Mikey enters the living room and makes fun of them. Amanda then discovers she is [[menstruating]] and tries to hide it, and when Nathan sees blood on her pants, he panics and believes her to be bleeding to death, causing a debacle, which would later have Nathan and Mikey's father Steve and Amanda's father involved. Amanda calls them out on their stupidity and feels embarrassed to know that she's getting her first period in front of them and they don't know what to do about it. When she leaves with her father, Nathan yells that the process of keeping the lining of her internal organs intact by inserting his erect phallus into her vagina is much too complicated and Mikey agrees.

Tired of typical first dates, Emily challenges Donald to a game of truth or dare. She dares him to grab a man's buttocks, and he follows with daring her to blow out the birthday candles on a blind boy's cake. The game rapidly escalates to extremes, in which both of them get plastic surgery and tattoos, and humiliate themselves. When Donald and Emily arrive back at Emily's apartment, they praise their date. Donald tries to kiss her, but she rejects him, claiming she's not attracted to Asian men (which he was surgically altered to resemble). It is revealed that she was joking and invites him to have sex with her as she shows him her enlarged breasts.\n\n;Cast\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Emily\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Donald\n* [[Sayed Badreya]] as Large man\n* [[Snooki]] as Herself\n* Caryl West as Waitress\n* [[Ricki Noel Lander]] as Nurse Elizabeth\n* Paloma Felisberto as Bachelorette party girl\n* Jasper Grey as Patron\n* Benny Harris as Blanco the bartender\n* [[Zen Gesner]] as Stripper\n\n====Victory's Glory====\n* Directed by [[Rusty Cundieff]] and written by Rocky Russo & Jeremy Sosenko\n\nSet in 1959, Coach Jackson is lecturing his all-black basketball team before their first game against an all-white team.

Beezel seems to detest Amy and anyone who comes between him and Anson, but Anson only sees Beezel as innocent. One day, Amy witnesses Beezel masturbating to summer vacation photos of Anson in a swimsuit. Beezel attacks her and violently urinates on her. Anson still finds his pet innocent but Amy threatens to leave if he doesn't get rid of Beezel. Caring more about his relationship, Anson agrees to find a new home for him. That night, from a closet, Beezel tearfully watches the couple make love (whilst [[sodomy|sodomizing]] himself with a hairbrush and [[dry humping]] a stuffed teddy bear). The next day when it comes time to take Beezel away, he is nowhere to be found. Amy goes outside to look. Beezel then runs her over with a truck and attempts to shoot her to death with a shotgun, but she chases him into the street and begins beating him with a shovel, which is witnessed by a group of children attending a birthday party at a neighboring house. When Anson approaches to see what is happening, Amy tries to explain Beezel's motives. Beezel acts innocent and Anson sides with his cat.

The scene was included as an extra on the DVD and Blu-ray release.\n\n;Cast\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Maude\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as George\n* Jordanna Taylor as Susie\n* [[Bob Odenkirk]] as Private Investigator\n\n====The Apprentice====\n* Written and directed by Steve Baker and Damon Escott\n\nThe second segment that was cut from the film follows Wayne, a shy apprentice mortician who is secretly a necrophiliac at the hospital he works at. One night, a body he's having sex with is brought back to life from the pressure of his thrusts. His supervisor Bob suddenly walks in and mistakenly believes that Wayne has performed a life-saving operation of some kind. The staff at the hospital and the media congratulate him while a news reporter asks what he did to save her. Unable to conjure an answer, one of the cops on scene tells everyone else they can just watch the security tapes to find out. As they rush to the security room, Wayne is given a personal thanks by the girl he revived, upon which he responds with an awkward \"You're welcome\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moviehole.net/201024475anton-yelchin-is-the-apprentice |title=Anton Yelchin is The Apprentice |date=April 19, 2010 |website=Moviehole.net |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3448498/ |title=The Apprentice (2014) |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://vimeo.com/133183116 |title=The Apprentice |first=Maria |last=Volk |date=July 10, 2015 |website=[[Vimeo]] |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> Unlike ''Find Our Daughter'', this segment was not included in the DVD or Blu-ray release<ref name=\"comicmix.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicmix.com/2013/06/24/review-movie-43/ |title=Review: Movie 43 |first=Robert |last=Greenberger |date=June 24, 2013 |website=ComicMix |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> and instead premiered at the 2014 LA Comedy Festival.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3448498/releaseinfo |title=The Apprentice (2014): Release Info |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n;Cast\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Wayne\n* [[Shane Jacobson]] as Bob\n* Maria Volk as Girl\n* Christopher Kirby as Cop\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nWessler first came up with the idea for an outrageous comedy made up of several short films in the early 2000s. \"It's like ''[[Funny or Die]]'', only if you could go crazy,\" judged Farrelly, \"because with ''Funny or Die'', there are certain limits. And we just wanted to do that kind of short and go much further than that.\" Charlie Wessler affirmed that he \"wanted to make a ''[[Kentucky Fried Movie]]'' for the modern age\".<ref name=\"NYPost\">{{cite news |title='Movie 43' is an ungodly gross-out epic that Hollywood's A-list wants to forget |last=Callahan |first=Maureen |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/the_ungodly_gross_out_epic_wood_mfCWrFl3qus9d0e1CRNWZN |date=January 20, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Post]] |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWessler then recruited three pairs of directors\u2014[[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], Peter and Bobby Farrelly, and [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]]\u2014to sign on to write and direct one-third of the project each. He then began working out a deal with a studio for the project, but the project did not stick. \"They ended up calling me about a month after we started negotiating the deal and said 'we can't do it' because they had political pressure to not make R-rated movies that were marketed to teenagers,\" claimed Wessler. He then went to multiple other studios, but, according to Wessler, \"no one could understand what [he] was trying to do\".<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Peter Farrelly and producer John Penotti took their pitch\u2014along with about 60 scripts for the vignettes\u2014to [[Relativity Media]]. At that meeting, Wessler, Penotti, and Farrelly presented one short that they already had shot, starring Kate Winslet as a woman going on a blind date with a seemingly successful and handsome Hugh Jackman. \"They just looked at me and said, 'Go for it,'\" Wessler told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. \"It takes a lot of balls to make something that is not conventional.\" Relativity provided $6 million for the film, but no other studio would sign on. \"Other potential backers\", Farrelly revealed, \"didn't believe it could happen\u2014a movie with Kate Winslet for $6 million?\"<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\nThe film officially began [[principal photography]] in March 2010, but due to its large cast, producer/director Farrelly told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that \"This movie was made over four years, and they just had to wait for a year or two years for different actors. They would shoot for a week, and shut down for several months. Same thing with the directors.

Many turned down the project.\n\"Most agents would avoid me because they knew what I wanted to do\u2014what agent wants to book their big client in a no pay, $800-a-day, two-day shoot?\" he said. \"The truth is, I had a lot of friends who were in this movie. And if they didn't say yes, this movie wouldn't have gotten made.\" In the end, most of the actors were willing to take part because the film only required a few days of their time and often allowed them to play a character outside of their wheelhouse.<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\n[[Hugh Jackman]] was the first actor Wessler cast. He met the star at a wedding and then called him some time later and pitched him the short. Jackman read the script and agreed to be a part of the film. \"He called me back I think 24 hours later and said, 'Yeah I wanna do this,' which I think is, quite frankly, incredibly ballsy. Because you could be made a fool of, or you could look silly, and there will be people who say, 'That's crazy; he should never have done it.'\"<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\nAfter talking to the multiple agents of [[Kate Winslet]], she eventually agreed to take part. The Winslet-Jackman sketch was shot shortly after, and became the reel to attract other A-list stars.<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\n[[John Hodgman]], who plays opposite [[Justin Long]] in one sketch, signed on with no knowledge of the project. Long, Hodgman's co-star in the long-running series of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s commercials, asked him what the project was, and he then signed on, without still knowing too much. Hodgman said, \"I got an e-mail from Justin that said, 'I'm going to be dressing up as Robin again. Do you want to dress up as the Penguin?' And I said yes. Without even realizing cameras would be involved, or that it would be a movie.\"<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\n[[James Gunn]] revealed during a [[Facebook]] Q&A that he was convinced to do the film by [[Elizabeth Banks]] and to \"blame her\" for it. He added \"I didn't even get to edit that stupid thing!\" He also has never seen the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/jgunn/videos/10154923971416157/|title=Hi everyone.

In fact, some stars hedged: [[Richard Gere]], a friend of Wessler's, said yes\u2014but also said he would not be available for more than a year. So Wessler waited him out, convinced his sketch was good. Gere eventually called Wessler and told him he was free to shoot, on just a couple of conditions: they had to do it in four days, and they needed to relocate the shoot from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]].<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\n\"They clearly wanted out!\" judged Farrelly. \"But we wouldn't let them. The strategy was simple: 'Wait for them. Shoot when they want to shoot. Guilt them to death.' It didn't work on everyone.\" [[Colin Farrell]] initially agreed to be in the Butler leprechaun sketch\u2014as Butler's brother, also a leprechaun\u2014but then he backed out and [[Gerard Butler]] did the sketch by himself. Farrelly said that when he approached [[George Clooney]] about playing himself in a sketch (the gag was that Clooney is bad at picking up women), Clooney told him \"No fucking way.\"<ref name=\"NYPost\"/> There were two sketches cut from the film that were originally shown during a [[test screening]]; one that starred [[Anton Yelchin]] as a [[necrophilia]]c mortician who worked at a hospital and had sex with the dead female bodies, and another starring [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Tony Shalhoub]] as a married couple being interviewed by a [[detective]] about their missing daughter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1333125/board/thread/209996584?d=209996855&p=1#209996855 |title=Re: Who Directed what Skits? |website=IMDb}}</ref> Producer Penotti said that the sketches would be seen on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of the film,<ref name=\"NYPost\"/> however only the latter was included in the release.<ref name=\"comicmix.com\"/>\n\nBecause the filmmakers worked around the stars' schedules, the filming of the whole movie took several years. While so many A-list actors were on board, most were not completely aware of what other sketches would be included in the film, which features thirteen vignettes tied together by a story of a mad screenwriter (Quaid) pitching ideas to a movie producer (Kinnear).

Wessler|Charlie Wessler]], a mad screenwriter, is attempting to pitch a script to film executive Griffin Schraeder. After revealing several of the stories in his script, Wessler becomes agitated when Schraeder dismisses his outrageous ideas, and he pulls a gun on him and forces him to listen to multiple other stories before making Schraeder consult his manager, Bob Mone, to purchase the film. When they do so, Mone's condescending, humiliating attitude toward Schraeder angers him to the point that, after agreeing to make the film \"the biggest film since ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]''\", he confronts Mone in the parking lot with a gun and tries to make him perform fellatio on the security guard (Wessler had gotten on the lot by doing the same thing) and kill him if he does not make the film. Wessler tries to calm Schraeder down with more story ideas to no avail, but Mone pulls out a gun and shoots Schraeder to death. The segment ends with it being revealed that it is being shot by a camera crew as part of the movie, leading into the final segments.\n\n;Cast\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Charlie Wessler\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Griffin Schraeder\n* [[Common (entertainer)|Common]] as Bob Mone\n* [[Charlie Saxton]] as Jay\n* [[Will Sasso]] as Jerry\n* Odessa Rae as Danita\n* [[Seth MacFarlane]] as himself\n* Mike Meldman as himself\n\n===Alternative version (The Thread)===\n* Directed by [[Steven Brill (scriptwriter)|Steven Brill]] and written by Rocky Russo and Jeremy Sosenko\n\nThe structure of the film released in some countries, like the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, differs.

J. make a video in the style of [[MTV]]'s ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' and upload it on [[YouTube]] where it instantly reaches over 1,000,000 views. This turns out to be an [[April Fool's|April Fool's prank]] from Calvin's younger brother Baxter, who cloned YouTube and hyper-inflated the views while working on his science project. Calvin and J.J. attempt to get revenge. They tell Baxter of a film that's so dangerous it will cause the annihilation of the world. The movie is known as Movie 43. While J.J. and Baxter look for Movie 43 on a [[Google]] standin, Calvin retrieves Baxter's laptop and loads it with [[Computer viruses|viruses]] from porn sites, and masturbates to a strip tease video on the porn sites in a bathroom. Baxter finds hundreds of results for Movie 43 on a website referred to by him as a dark corner of the [[Internet]]. They find the sketches starting from the 43rd search on the list of results. As he and J.J. keep watching videos, they are interrupted by a man known as Vrankovich and a group of Chinese mobsters who are tempted to find Movie 43, even going as far as to take J.J.'s classmate Stevie Schraeder, film executive Griffin Schraeder's oldest son, hostage. Vrankovich warns them that if they find Movie 43, civilization will be destroyed. They ignore his claims and keep searching. They eventually find the real, the one and only ''Movie 43'', which turns out to be from the future. It shows Baxter as a profane commando who leads a group of recruits to survive after the world has ended.

The boss listens to his various workers argue over the placement of a fan that was built into the genital region of the iBabe, which is cutting off the penises of teenage boys who attempt to have sex with them.

When they begin to kiss, his older brother Mikey enters the living room and makes fun of them. Amanda then discovers she is [[menstruating]] and tries to hide it, and when Nathan sees blood on her pants, he panics and believes her to be bleeding to death, causing a debacle, which would later have Nathan and Mikey's father Steve and Amanda's father involved. Amanda calls them out on their stupidity and feels embarrassed to know that she's getting her first period in front of them and they don't know what to do about it. When she leaves with her father, Nathan yells that the process of keeping the lining of her internal organs intact by inserting his erect phallus into her vagina is much too complicated and Mikey agrees.

Tired of typical first dates, Emily challenges Donald to a game of truth or dare. She dares him to grab a man's buttocks, and he follows with daring her to blow out the birthday candles on a blind boy's cake. The game rapidly escalates to extremes, in which both of them get plastic surgery and tattoos, and humiliate themselves. When Donald and Emily arrive back at Emily's apartment, they praise their date. Donald tries to kiss her, but she rejects him, claiming she's not attracted to Asian men (which he was surgically altered to resemble). It is revealed that she was joking and invites him to have sex with her as she shows him her enlarged breasts.\n\n;Cast\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Emily\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Donald\n* [[Sayed Badreya]] as Large man\n* [[Snooki]] as Herself\n* Caryl West as Waitress\n* [[Ricki Noel Lander]] as Nurse Elizabeth\n* Paloma Felisberto as Bachelorette party girl\n* Jasper Grey as Patron\n* Benny Harris as Blanco the bartender\n* [[Zen Gesner]] as Stripper\n\n====Victory's Glory====\n* Directed by [[Rusty Cundieff]] and written by Rocky Russo & Jeremy Sosenko\n\nSet in 1959, Coach Jackson is lecturing his all-black basketball team before their first game against an all-white team.

Beezel seems to detest Amy and anyone who comes between him and Anson, but Anson only sees Beezel as innocent. One day, Amy witnesses Beezel masturbating to summer vacation photos of Anson in a swimsuit. Beezel attacks her and violently urinates on her. Anson still finds his pet innocent but Amy threatens to leave if he doesn't get rid of Beezel. Caring more about his relationship, Anson agrees to find a new home for him. That night, from a closet, Beezel tearfully watches the couple make love (whilst [[sodomy|sodomizing]] himself with a hairbrush and [[dry humping]] a stuffed teddy bear). The next day when it comes time to take Beezel away, he is nowhere to be found. Amy goes outside to look. Beezel then runs her over with a truck and attempts to shoot her to death with a shotgun, but she chases him into the street and begins beating him with a shovel, which is witnessed by a group of children attending a birthday party at a neighboring house. When Anson approaches to see what is happening, Amy tries to explain Beezel's motives. Beezel acts innocent and Anson sides with his cat. The children of the party then attack and murder Amy for beating up Beezel, stabbing her with plastic forks. Anson grabs Beezel, as Beezel again fantasizes about [[French kiss]]ing his owner.\n\n;Cast\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Amy\n* [[Josh Duhamel]] as Anson\n* [[Emily Alyn Lind]] as Birthday girl\n* Michelle Gunn as Mommy\n* [[Christina Linhardt]] as Party clown\n\n====Find Our Daughter====\n* Written and directed by [[Bob Odenkirk]]\n\nIn this segment that was cut from the film, Maude and George are looking for their breast-flashing daughter Susie with the help of the private eye, who is behind the camera with only one clue which is a small video that features their daughter. The scene was included as an extra on the DVD and Blu-ray release.\n\n;Cast\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Maude\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as George\n* Jordanna Taylor as Susie\n* [[Bob Odenkirk]] as Private Investigator\n\n====The Apprentice====\n* Written and directed by Steve Baker and Damon Escott\n\nThe second segment that was cut from the film follows Wayne, a shy apprentice mortician who is secretly a necrophiliac at the hospital he works at. One night, a body he's having sex with is brought back to life from the pressure of his thrusts. His supervisor Bob suddenly walks in and mistakenly believes that Wayne has performed a life-saving operation of some kind. The staff at the hospital and the media congratulate him while a news reporter asks what he did to save her. Unable to conjure an answer, one of the cops on scene tells everyone else they can just watch the security tapes to find out. As they rush to the security room, Wayne is given a personal thanks by the girl he revived, upon which he responds with an awkward \"You're welcome\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moviehole.net/201024475anton-yelchin-is-the-apprentice |title=Anton Yelchin is The Apprentice |date=April 19, 2010 |website=Moviehole.net |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3448498/ |title=The Apprentice (2014) |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://vimeo.com/133183116 |title=The Apprentice |first=Maria |last=Volk |date=July 10, 2015 |website=[[Vimeo]] |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> Unlike ''Find Our Daughter'', this segment was not included in the DVD or Blu-ray release<ref name=\"comicmix.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicmix.com/2013/06/24/review-movie-43/ |title=Review: Movie 43 |first=Robert |last=Greenberger |date=June 24, 2013 |website=ComicMix |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> and instead premiered at the 2014 LA Comedy Festival.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3448498/releaseinfo |title=The Apprentice (2014): Release Info |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n;Cast\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Wayne\n* [[Shane Jacobson]] as Bob\n* Maria Volk as Girl\n* Christopher Kirby as Cop\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nWessler first came up with the idea for an outrageous comedy made up of several short films in the early 2000s. \"It's like ''[[Funny or Die]]'', only if you could go crazy,\" judged Farrelly, \"because with ''Funny or Die'', there are certain limits. And we just wanted to do that kind of short and go much further than that.\" Charlie Wessler affirmed that he \"wanted to make a ''[[Kentucky Fried Movie]]'' for the modern age\".<ref name=\"NYPost\">{{cite news |title='Movie 43' is an ungodly gross-out epic that Hollywood's A-list wants to forget |last=Callahan |first=Maureen |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/the_ungodly_gross_out_epic_wood_mfCWrFl3qus9d0e1CRNWZN |date=January 20, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Post]] |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWessler then recruited three pairs of directors\u2014[[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], Peter and Bobby Farrelly, and [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]]\u2014to sign on to write and direct one-third of the project each. He then began working out a deal with a studio for the project, but the project did not stick. \"They ended up calling me about a month after we started negotiating the deal and said 'we can't do it' because they had political pressure to not make R-rated movies that were marketed to teenagers,\" claimed Wessler. He then went to multiple other studios, but, according to Wessler, \"no one could understand what [he] was trying to do\".<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Peter Farrelly and producer John Penotti took their pitch\u2014along with about 60 scripts for the vignettes\u2014to [[Relativity Media]]. At that meeting, Wessler, Penotti, and Farrelly presented one short that they already had shot, starring Kate Winslet as a woman going on a blind date with a seemingly successful and handsome Hugh Jackman. \"They just looked at me and said, 'Go for it,'\" Wessler told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. \"It takes a lot of balls to make something that is not conventional.\" Relativity provided $6 million for the film, but no other studio would sign on. \"Other potential backers\", Farrelly revealed, \"didn't believe it could happen\u2014a movie with Kate Winslet for $6 million?\"<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\nThe film officially began [[principal photography]] in March 2010, but due to its large cast, producer/director Farrelly told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that \"This movie was made over four years, and they just had to wait for a year or two years for different actors. They would shoot for a week, and shut down for several months. Same thing with the directors.

Many turned down the project.\n\"Most agents would avoid me because they knew what I wanted to do\u2014what agent wants to book their big client in a no pay, $800-a-day, two-day shoot?\" he said. \"The truth is, I had a lot of friends who were in this movie. And if they didn't say yes, this movie wouldn't have gotten made.\" In the end, most of the actors were willing to take part because the film only required a few days of their time and often allowed them to play a character outside of their wheelhouse.<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\n[[Hugh Jackman]] was the first actor Wessler cast. He met the star at a wedding and then called him some time later and pitched him the short. Jackman read the script and agreed to be a part of the film. \"He called me back I think 24 hours later and said, 'Yeah I wanna do this,' which I think is, quite frankly, incredibly ballsy. Because you could be made a fool of, or you could look silly, and there will be people who say, 'That's crazy; he should never have done it.'\"<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\nAfter talking to the multiple agents of [[Kate Winslet]], she eventually agreed to take part. The Winslet-Jackman sketch was shot shortly after, and became the reel to attract other A-list stars.<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\n[[John Hodgman]], who plays opposite [[Justin Long]] in one sketch, signed on with no knowledge of the project. Long, Hodgman's co-star in the long-running series of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s commercials, asked him what the project was, and he then signed on, without still knowing too much. Hodgman said, \"I got an e-mail from Justin that said, 'I'm going to be dressing up as Robin again. Do you want to dress up as the Penguin?' And I said yes. Without even realizing cameras would be involved, or that it would be a movie.\"<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\n[[James Gunn]] revealed during a [[Facebook]] Q&A that he was convinced to do the film by [[Elizabeth Banks]] and to \"blame her\" for it. He added \"I didn't even get to edit that stupid thing!\" He also has never seen the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/jgunn/videos/10154923971416157/|title=Hi everyone.

In fact, some stars hedged: [[Richard Gere]], a friend of Wessler's, said yes\u2014but also said he would not be available for more than a year. So Wessler waited him out, convinced his sketch was good. Gere eventually called Wessler and told him he was free to shoot, on just a couple of conditions: they had to do it in four days, and they needed to relocate the shoot from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]].<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\n\"They clearly wanted out!\" judged Farrelly. \"But we wouldn't let them. The strategy was simple: 'Wait for them. Shoot when they want to shoot. Guilt them to death.' It didn't work on everyone.\" [[Colin Farrell]] initially agreed to be in the Butler leprechaun sketch\u2014as Butler's brother, also a leprechaun\u2014but then he backed out and [[Gerard Butler]] did the sketch by himself. Farrelly said that when he approached [[George Clooney]] about playing himself in a sketch (the gag was that Clooney is bad at picking up women), Clooney told him \"No fucking way.\"<ref name=\"NYPost\"/> There were two sketches cut from the film that were originally shown during a [[test screening]]; one that starred [[Anton Yelchin]] as a [[necrophilia]]c mortician who worked at a hospital and had sex with the dead female bodies, and another starring [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Tony Shalhoub]] as a married couple being interviewed by a [[detective]] about their missing daughter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1333125/board/thread/209996584?d=209996855&p=1#209996855 |title=Re: Who Directed what Skits? |website=IMDb}}</ref> Producer Penotti said that the sketches would be seen on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of the film,<ref name=\"NYPost\"/> however only the latter was included in the release.<ref name=\"comicmix.com\"/>\n\nBecause the filmmakers worked around the stars' schedules, the filming of the whole movie took several years. While so many A-list actors were on board, most were not completely aware of what other sketches would be included in the film, which features thirteen vignettes tied together by a story of a mad screenwriter (Quaid) pitching ideas to a movie producer (Kinnear). Penotti said many of the actors did not ask many questions about what else was going on in the film.\n\"They were attracted to their script, and as long as that tickled their funnybone, that was enough,\" he revealed.<ref name=\"NYPost\"/><ref name=\"HR-415196\"/>\n\n==Promotion==\nThe title of the film, ''Movie 43'' has no meaning. Farrelly heard his son talking with friends about a film called \"Movie 43\", but when Farrelly discovered the film did not exist, he cribbed the name.<ref name=\"NYPost\"/>\n\nRelativity did little to promote the film and none of the cast members did any promotion of the film. The film was not screened for critics in advance. \"The slapdash title, the lack of promotion and advance screenings, the release date\u2014none of it bodes well,\" opined ''Entertainment Weekly'' senior editor Thom Geier. \"January is usually where movies go to die,\" Geier argued. \"And to go by the trailer\u2014the only option\u2014the content seems dated.\" A [[Trailer (promotion)#Rating cards|red-band trailer]] was released on October 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stillman |first=Josh |title=''Movie 43'' trailer: Kate Winslet, Naomi Watts, and Emma Stone get their NSFW on |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/10/03/movie-43-trailer-kate-winslet-naomi-watts-and-emma-stone/ |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |date=October 3, 2012}}</ref> Farrelly was optimistic: \"Kids, teenagers, 50-somethings who still smoke pot\u2014they're all going to find something here,\" he asserted.<ref name=\"NYPost\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''Movie 43'' was panned by critics, with some considering it to be [[List of films considered the worst|one of the worst films ever made]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/29/movie-43-peter-farrelly-twitter |title=Movie 43 director tells critics to 'lighten up' after film bombs at box office |last=Child |first=Ben |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}</ref> The film received a [[weighted average]] score of 18 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 23 critics, signifying \"overwhelming dislike\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/movie-43 |title=Movie 43 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=May 9, 2019}}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 5% positive rating based on 88 reviews, with an average rating of 2.23/10.
