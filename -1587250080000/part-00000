In this book, Dewey compares Reiner\u2019s process to the \u201cold monk poet Basho, who, it was said, would go into the mountains to pay tribute to specific trees,\u201d though of course Reiner typically approaches trees via car.<ref name=\"auto1\">Fred Dewey. \u201cIf We are Lucky.\u201d ''Los Angeles Trees, 2001-2008''. Munich.

''Trees and Words''. Venice. Beyond Baroque. 2004.</ref> \"The result is quiet, calling for contemplation, and, in a final move, hints at the story and mystery behind the shape.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Work==\n===Color Field Paintings===\n\"Beginning with minimalist canvases, Reiner moved into painting signs and word fragments in the urban landscape, influenced by the work of LA artists Ruscha,  Diebenkorn, Celmins...\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Although Reiner's abstract paintings have also been compared to those by Mark Rothko and Cy Twombly, critics have been quick to note that his \u201ccolor field\u201d paintings capably distill quotidian experiences into particular palettes. Toby Crockett observed how \"Reiner's controlled approach creates a template by which the world can be reduced to its juicy details [and] is filled with genuine feeling.\"<ref>Toby Crockett. \"Lucas Reiner at Bennett Roberts.''Art in America''. May 1996.</ref>\n\n===City Tree Paintings===\nAfter spending time in the Michigan forests in 2001, Reiner started to focus on the trees in his [[Los Angeles]] environment.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Responding to the way urban trees are routinely brutalized by trucks, sidewalks, and neglectful passersby, Reiner started creating little tree portraits. Fred Dewey wonders why it took contemporary artists so long to address suffering city trees, since [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] noticed the savage cutting of trees around 1870.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nEve Wood noted that \"these dense little paintings are more than quaint depictions of [city] trees, but encapsulate both their stature and movement, as well as a kind of ineffable presence.\"<ref>Eve Wood. \"Implied Narratives.\" Artnet. January 27, 2003.</ref> From observing Reiner's tree paintings, whose titles reflect their particular locations, Petra Giloy-Hirtz discovers that Los Angeles trees are \u201ccrooked, mistreated, strangely trimmed, pruned into shapes by the traffic, grazed by the truck, cut back to cut the view of the billboards, [and even] alienated by signs, Christmas decorations, or graffiti.\u201d<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nResponding to Reiner's tree paintings, Nicholas Grider observes how \u201cspecific individual trees\u2026float against delicately-colored abstract expressionist backgrounds that recall Phillip Guston\u2019s early work. The tension between specificity and the general nature of the gestural background s deliberately leads the viewer to think not just about trees as portrait subjects, but about what his or her own relationship with trees is in daily life.\u201d <ref>Nicholas Grider. \u201cMinimalism, Theatricality, and You.\u201d \u2018\u2019Artslant.\u2019\u2019 September 9, 2007.</ref> Petra Giloy-Hirtz adds, \"For in the end the tree is not an unusual theme in the history of art. It is less about the phenomenology of the tree than about the possibilities of painting.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/> Regarding Reiner's relationship to his subject matter, Dewey adds that \"The links of Reiner's work to those of painter Giorgio Morandi are clear.

In this book, Dewey compares Reiner\u2019s process to the \u201cold monk poet Basho, who, it was said, would go into the mountains to pay tribute to specific trees,\u201d though of course Reiner typically approaches trees via car.<ref name=\"auto1\">Fred Dewey. \u201cIf We are Lucky.\u201d ''Los Angeles Trees, 2001-2008''.

Toby Crockett observed how \"Reiner's controlled approach creates a template by which the world can be reduced to its juicy details [and] is filled with genuine feeling.\"<ref>Toby Crockett. \"Lucas Reiner at Bennett Roberts.''Art in America''. May 1996.</ref>\n\n===City Tree Paintings===\nAfter spending time in the Michigan forests in 2001, Reiner started to focus on the trees in his [[Los Angeles]] environment.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Responding to the way urban trees are routinely brutalized by trucks, sidewalks, and neglectful passersby, Reiner started creating little tree portraits. Fred Dewey wonders why it took contemporary artists so long to address suffering city trees, since [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] noticed the savage cutting of trees around 1870.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nEve Wood noted that \"these dense little paintings are more than quaint depictions of [city] trees, but encapsulate both their stature and movement, as well as a kind of ineffable presence.\"<ref>Eve Wood. \"Implied Narratives.\" Artnet. January 27, 2003.</ref> From observing Reiner's tree paintings, whose titles reflect their particular locations, Petra Giloy-Hirtz discovers that Los Angeles trees are \u201ccrooked, mistreated, strangely trimmed, pruned into shapes by the traffic, grazed by the truck, cut back to cut the view of the billboards, [and even] alienated by signs, Christmas decorations, or graffiti.\u201d<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nResponding to Reiner's tree paintings, Nicholas Grider observes how \u201cspecific individual trees\u2026float against delicately-colored abstract expressionist backgrounds that recall Phillip Guston\u2019s early work. The tension between specificity and the general nature of the gestural background s deliberately leads the viewer to think not just about trees as portrait subjects, but about what his or her own relationship with trees is in daily life.\u201d <ref>Nicholas Grider. \u201cMinimalism, Theatricality, and You.\u201d \u2018\u2019Artslant.\u2019\u2019 September 9, 2007.</ref> Petra Giloy-Hirtz adds, \"For in the end the tree is not an unusual theme in the history of art.
