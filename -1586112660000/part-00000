It is the fourth most populous city in Kazakhstan, behind [[Almaty]] (Alma-Ata), [[Nur-Sultan]] and [[Shymkent]]. Population: {{Kz-census2009|459,778|punct=;}} {{Kz-census1999|436,864|punct=.}} Karaganda is approximately 230&nbsp;km south-east of Kazakhstan's capital Nur-Sultan (formerly known as Astana).\n\nIn the 1940s up to 70% of the city's inhabitants were ethnic [[Germans]].{{fact|date=August 2019}} Most of the [[Germans of Kazakhstan|ethnic Germans]] were Soviet [[Volga German]]s who were collectively deported to [[Siberia]] and Kazakhstan on [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s order when Hitler invaded [[Kresy|Soviet-annexed eastern Poland]] and the Soviet Union proper in 1941. Until the 1950s, many of these deportees were interned in labor camps, often simply because they were of German descent. The population of Karaganda fell by 14% from 1989-1999 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union; it was once Kazakhstan's second-largest city after Almaty. Over 100,000 people have since emigrated to [[Germany]]. There is also a concentration of [[Poles in Kazakhstan|ethnic Poles]] in the city.\n\n== History ==\nThe name \"Karaganda\" is derived from \"[[caragana]]\" bushes (''[[Caragana arborescens]]'', ''Caragana frutex''), which are abundant in the area.\n\nThe original site of Karaganda is now labeled on [[city map]]s as the \"Old Town\", but almost nothing remains on that site. In exploiting the rich [[coal]] deposits of the area, the Soviets undermined the entire city. <!-- Only three or four buildings remain in the ghostly Old Town, of which one is the old (and once ornate) theatre, and another an old fire station mentioned in [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]].'' TO DO: need to clarify their current existence -->\n\nThis area was abandoned. The city was relocated to the south, where it was rebuilt.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Karaganda was briefly considered as a candidate for the capital of the (then) newly independent Republic of Kazakhstan, but its bid was turned down in favour of [[Astana]].\n\n=== EMP ===\n[[File:\u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043c \u042e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439.JPG|right|255px|thumb|Nurken Abdirov Street at the corner of Gogol Street.]]\nKaraganda suffered the most severe [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] effects ever observed when its electrical [[power plant]] was set on fire by currents induced in a {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} long shallow buried [[electric power transmission|power cable]] by Soviet Test \u2018184\u2019 on 22 October 1962.  The test was part of the [[Soviet Project K nuclear tests]] ([[anti-ballistic missile|ABM System A]] proof tests), and consisted of a 300-[[kiloton]] [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]] at an altitude of {{convert|290|km|abbr=on}} over [[Zhezkazgan]].\n\nPrompt [[gamma ray]]-produced EMP induced a current of 2,500 amps measured by [[spark gap]]s in a {{convert|570|km|abbr=on}} stretch of overhead telephone line to Zharyq, blowing all the [[fuse (electrical)|protective fuses]]. The late-time [[Magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]]-EMP was of low enough frequency to enable it to penetrate {{convert|90|cm|abbr=on}} into the ground, overloading a shallow buried lead and steel tape-protected {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} long power cable between [[Astana|Aqmola]] (now called Nur-Sultan) and [[Almaty]].

It is the fourth most populous city in Kazakhstan, behind [[Almaty]] (Alma-Ata), [[Nur-Sultan]] and [[Shymkent]]. Population: {{Kz-census2009|459,778|punct=;}} {{Kz-census1999|436,864|punct=.}} Karaganda is approximately 230&nbsp;km south-east of Kazakhstan's capital Nur-Sultan (formerly known as Astana).\n\nIn the 1940s up to 70% of the city's inhabitants were ethnic [[Germans]].{{fact|date=August 2019}} Most of the [[Germans of Kazakhstan|ethnic Germans]] were Soviet [[Volga German]]s who were collectively deported to [[Siberia]] and Kazakhstan on [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s order when Hitler invaded [[Kresy|Soviet-annexed eastern Poland]] and the Soviet Union proper in 1941. Until the 1950s, many of these deportees were interned in labor camps, often simply because they were of German descent. The population of Karaganda fell by 14% from 1989-1999 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union; it was once Kazakhstan's second-largest city after Almaty. Over 100,000 people have since emigrated to [[Germany]]. There is also a concentration of [[Poles in Kazakhstan|ethnic Poles]] in the city.\n\n== History ==\nThe name \"Karaganda\" is derived from \"[[caragana]]\" bushes (''[[Caragana arborescens]]'', ''Caragana frutex''), which are abundant in the area.\n\nThe original site of Karaganda is now labeled on [[city map]]s as the \"Old Town\", but almost nothing remains on that site. In exploiting the rich [[coal]] deposits of the area, the Soviets undermined the entire city. <!-- Only three or four buildings remain in the ghostly Old Town, of which one is the old (and once ornate) theatre, and another an old fire station mentioned in [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]].'' TO DO: need to clarify their current existence -->\n\nThis area was abandoned. The city was relocated to the south, where it was rebuilt.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Karaganda was briefly considered as a candidate for the capital of the (then) newly independent Republic of Kazakhstan, but its bid was turned down in favour of [[Astana]].\n\n=== EMP ===\n[[File:\u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043c \u042e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439.JPG|right|255px|thumb|Nurken Abdirov Street at the corner of Gogol Street.]]\nKaraganda suffered the most severe [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] effects ever observed when its electrical [[power plant]] was set on fire by currents induced in a {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} long shallow buried [[electric power transmission|power cable]] by Soviet Test \u2018184\u2019 on 22 October 1962.  The test was part of the [[Soviet Project K nuclear tests]] ([[anti-ballistic missile|ABM System A]] proof tests), and consisted of a 300-[[kiloton]] [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]] at an altitude of {{convert|290|km|abbr=on}} over [[Zhezkazgan]].\n\nPrompt [[gamma ray]]-produced EMP induced a current of 2,500 amps measured by [[spark gap]]s in a {{convert|570|km|abbr=on}} stretch of overhead telephone line to Zharyq, blowing all the [[fuse (electrical)|protective fuses]]. The late-time [[Magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]]-EMP was of low enough frequency to enable it to penetrate {{convert|90|cm|abbr=on}} into the ground, overloading a shallow buried lead and steel tape-protected {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} long power cable between [[Astana|Aqmola]] (now called Nur-Sultan) and [[Almaty]].

Ah! Of what fault was I formerly guilty in another body that I should see mine only son meet with death ? This boy had not yet reached adolescence, his fourteenth year not having been completed! To my misfortune, before his time, this dear child has been struck down by death! In a few days, I and thy mother too will die of grief, O Dear Child! I do not recollect ever to have uttered a lie; I do not remember ever inflicting an injury on any animal or doing harm to any person! People perish under the unrighteous rule of an impious monarch. The evil conduct of a king brings about the premature death of his subjects. When, in the cities and country, crimes are committed and no supervision is exercised, then death is to be feared! Undoubtedly the king will be held to be at fault in city and country, hence the death of this child.\" Such were the countless recriminations that the unfortunate father addressed to the king whilst he clasped his son to his breast. The piteous lamentations of that unfortunate brahmin reached the ears of the king and he, in the profound distress, called together his ministers, Vasishtha and Vamadeva, with his brothers and the elders of the city also. Then eight brahmins were ushered into the king's presence by Vasishtha, who resembled a God, and they said \"May prosperity attend thee!\" Thereafter those foremost of the Twice-born, Markandeya, Maudgajya, Vamadeva, Kashyapa, Katyayana, Javali, Gautama and Narada took their seats, and those Rishis being assembled, Rama paid obeisance to them with joined palms. Then the ministers and citizens received a cordial welcome, as was fitting, and all those highly effulgent persons being seated near him, Raghava informed them of the reproaches of that Twice-born One. Hearing the words of the prince, who was fined with distress, Narada himself made this memorable reply in the assembly of the Sages \u201cLearn, O King, what has caused the untimely death of this child! When thou art conversant therewith, do what thou considerest to be thy duty ! O Prince, Joy of the Raghus, formerly in the Krita Yuga, the brahmins alone practiced asceticism; he who was not a brahmin in no wise undertook it. At the close of that age, all was consumed and absorbed into Brahman. Thereafter the 5 brahmins were re-born enlightened and endowed with the gift of immortality. In that age, none died prematurely and all were wise. The Treta Yuga followed when the sons of Manu were born, one who practiced austerities; these noble men were the rulers, and full of power and heroism. In that era, Brahmins and Kshatriyas were equal in power nor could any distinction be found amongst them; it was then that the four castes were established. In the Treta Yuga, brahmins and warriors practiced asceticism and the rest were under the supreme obligation of obedience, proper to the Vaishya and Shudra classes; the Shudras' duty being to serve the other three. O Great King, in the Dwapara Yuga, untruth and evil increased, unrighteousness having placed a second foot on the earth, and then the Vaishyas began to practice penance, so that dharma, in the form of asceticism, was performed by the three castes, but the Shudras were not permitted to undertake it during that time, O Foremost of Men. O Prince, a man of the lowest caste may not give himself up to penance in the Dwapara Yuga; it is only in the Kali Yuga that the practice of asceticism is permitted to the Shudra caste. During the Dwapara Yuga it is a great crime for one of Shudra birth to perform such practices. At this time, in thine empire, a rigid penance is being undertaken by a wretched Shudra, O Prince, and this is the cause of the death of that child. An act of mortification that is prescribed is well done and a sixth of the merit goes to the king who rules with justice. But how should he, who does not protect his people, enjoy the sixth portion? O Lion among Men, thou should investigate the happenings in thy kingdom and put down evil wherever it is practised, so righteousness may flourish, man's life be prolonged and the child be revived.\" Rama makes a Tour of Inspection of his Kingdom hearing the nectar-like words of Narada, Rama was delighted and said to Lakshmana \u201cO Dear Friend, thou who art faithful to thy vows, go and console that leading brahmin and cause the body of the child to be placed in a jar of oil with precious unguents and fragrant salves so that it is covered and does not suffer decomposition. Act in such a way that the body of the child does not dissolve or decay.\" Having issued this command to Lakshmana, who was endowed with auspicious marks, the highly illustrious Kakutstha thought of Pushpaka, and said \u201cCome hither!\" Conscious of his intention, the golden chariot appeared before him in the same hour and bowing, said to him \u201cBehold, I am here at thy service, O Long-armed Prince! Listening to the gracious words of Pushpaka, Rama paid obeisance to the great Rishis and ascended the chariot. Armed with his bow, his two quivers and his glittering sword, Raghava left the city in the charge of his two brothers, Saumitri and Bharata, and thereafter that monarch directed his course to the western region which he explored on every side; then he went to the northern region bounded by the Himalayas, but found no one. No trace of evil-doing there; later the eastern region was carefully searched by him and that long-armed Prince, from on high in his chariot, beheld people of pure morals there, as stainless as a mirror. \nThen he, who causes felicity to the great Rishis, ranged the southern region and, on the side of the Shaivaja Mountain, a vast lake appeared to him, on the banks of which the blessed Raghava beheld an ascetic practicing an extremely rigorous penance, his head hanging downwards. On this that Prince approached the one who had given himself up to rigorous practices and said \"Blessed art thou, O Ascetic, who art faithful to thy vows ! From what caste art thou sprung, O Thou who hast grown old in mortification and who art established in heroism. I am interested in this matter, I, Rama, the son of Dasaratha. What purpose hast thou in view? Is it heaven or some other object? What boon dost thou seek by means of this hard penance? I wish to know what thou desire in performing these austerities, oh Ascetic. May prosperity attend thee! Art thou a brahmin ? Art thou an invincible Kshatriya? Art thou a Vaishya, one of the third caste or art thou a Shudra? Answer me truthfully!\" Then the ascetic, who was hanging head downwards, thus questioned by Rama, revealed his origin to that Prince born of Dasaratha, the foremost of kings, and the reason why he was practicing penance. Hearing the words of Rama of imperishable exploits, that ascetic, his head still hanging downwards, answered \"O Rama, I was born of a Shudra alliance and I am performing this rigorous penance in order to acquire the status of a God in this body. I am not telling a lie, O Rama, I wish to attain the Celestial Region. Know that I am a Shudra and my name is Shambuka.\" As he was yet speaking, Raghava, drawing his brilliant and stainless sword from its scabbard, cut off his head. The Shudra being slain, all the Gods and their leaders with Agni's followers, cried out, \u201cWell done! Well done!\" overwhelming Rama with praise, and a rain of celestial flowers of divine fragrance fell on all sides, scattered by Vayu. In their supreme satisfaction, the Gods said to that hero, Rama \u201cThou hast protected the interests of the Gods, O Highly Intelligent Prince, now ask a boon, O Beloved Offspring of Raghu, Destroyer of Thy Foes.

The Chiefs traded Alex Smith to the Washington Redskins after the season and named Mahomes as the starting QB for 2018. Mahomes quickly showed off his talents on the field, setting an NFL record with 10 TD passes in his first 3 games <ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/chiefs/2018/09/23/chiefs-patrick-mahomes-record-touchdown-passes-three-weeks/1404587002/</ref> and throwing for 300 yards in 8 of the first 9 games of the 2018 season. Mahomes ultimately finished the 2018 season with 5,097 passing yards and 50 touchdowns, becoming the youngest player since [[Dan Marino]] in 1984 to throw for that many yards, and the second player in NFL history, along with [[Peyton Manning]], to throw for 5,000 passing yards and 50 touchdowns in the same season.

The Chiefs, however, fell short of an [[AFC Championship Game]] bid as the Chiefs lost to the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/kan/2015.htm</ref>  Alex Smith recorded his career high in passing yards that season, however, with 3,486 yards, and also had twenty touchdowns and seven interceptions. In 2016, Alex Smith started his fourth straight season as Chiefs quarterback. He was injured in Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts, however he only missed one game and backup quarterback [[Nick Foles]] led them to a 19-14 win over the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] the following week.

The Chiefs traded Alex Smith to the Washington Redskins after the season and named Mahomes as the starting QB for 2018. Mahomes quickly showed off his talents on the field, setting an NFL record with 10 TD passes in his first 3 games <ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/chiefs/2018/09/23/chiefs-patrick-mahomes-record-touchdown-passes-three-weeks/1404587002/</ref> and throwing for 300 yards in 8 of the first 9 games of the 2018 season. Mahomes ultimately finished the 2018 season with 5,097 passing yards and 50 touchdowns, becoming the youngest player since [[Dan Marino]] in 1984 to throw for that many yards, and the second player in NFL history, along with [[Peyton Manning]], to throw for 5,000 passing yards and 50 touchdowns in the same season.

From 1878 to 1885, the college continued to struggle from the aftershocks of economic depression; with an increasing debt and shrinking student body, the college turned to its 7th president, Reverend Donald MacGregor. A shrewd and well connected businessman, President MacGregor relieved a great deal of the college's debt and returned operations to normalcy. After MacGregor's death in 1887, the college welcomed President Luckett back to the campus. Throughout his second term as president, Samuel Luckett adopted a military program, grew the student body, introduced a YMCA chapter, established intercollegiate athletics and Greek fraternities, and added two wings to Old Main.\n\nOne of the school's most iconic presidents came in the form of Reverend Thomas Stone Clyce, who served as the Austin College president from 1900 to 1931; Reverend Clyce's presidency would become, and remains, the longest tenure in Austin College history.\n\nOn January 21 of 1913, Old Main was set ablaze and burnt to the ground in a matter of hours. A professor of Austin College, Davis Foute Eagleton described the incident: {{quote|\"''Austin College on fire and every particle of wood reduced to ashes--and walls rendered totally unfit for use. Oh, dies irae, dies irae! - The dear old building in which I have laboured for twenty-four years, gone! What traditions, memories, griefs, joys, were associated with it! The carpenters were approaching the completion of their work. The new English room was completed, the library room was soon to be ready. The literary societies lost everything. I lost all books, or, [those] in my class room. The laboratories were almost a total loss. Fortunately, the library, records, and office furniture were all in the new Y.M.C.A. building. Before the fire had begun to die out, the Senior class called the student body together and they pledged themselves by classes in writing to stand by the Faculty and the College, and that no one would leave. The Faculty also met shortly after and unanimously decided to continue college work the next day as usual, meeting their classes in places designated. Probably not another institution in the State could have done this.''

Now one of the oldest buildings on the Austin College campus, Sherman Hall housed administrative offices, an auditorium-chapel, and a library. Now the home of the [[humanities]] division, Sherman Hall boasted such guests as [[Harry Houdini]], [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.|Harry Blackstone Sr]]., [[Ernestine Schumann-Heink|Madame Schumann-Heink]], [[William Howard Taft]], and [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W.

Throughout 1942, Austin College trained some 300 men and women in engineering, science and management courses as part of the United States Office of Education's war efforts. The following year, Austin College undertook a Cadet nurses training program and hosted Naval Reserves, Texas Home Guard, Army-air trainees and Air Corps Cadets.\n\nOn September 20, 1973, the musician [[Jim Croce]] died in a [[plane crash]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]], on his way to perform the next night at Austin College. Six people died in the crash.\n\nIn 1994, Dr. Oscar Page joined the community as its 14th president. Under his tenure, 1994-2009, Dr. Page increased the school's endowment by nearly 80%, due in large part to his dedicated fundraising efforts as evidenced by the success of the \"Campaign for the New Era;\" a total of $120 million were raised and the campaign was heralded as the largest fundraiser in Austin College's history. Dr. Page orchestrated the construction of Jordan Family Language House, Jerry E. Apple Stadium, the Robert J. and Mary Wright Campus Center, the Robert M. and Joyce A. Johnson 'Roo Suites, and the Betsy Dennis Forster Art Studio Complex; as well as the renovation of  the David E. and Cassie L.

He then went on to say: \"The words go together, but they can be separate and inspire different feelings and thoughts. It's all-encompassing. When you turn on the radio, what are the themes that everybody relates to? We all relate to sex and love.

I think it's something we can all relate to no matter what religion no matter what personality, no matter what colour we can all relate to it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv3.ie/entertainment_article.php?locID=1.803.810&article=126162 |title=Enrique Iglesias thinks legs are sexy - TV3 Xpos\u00e9 Entertainment |publisher=Tv3.ie |date=12 February 2014 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nSpeaking about his album Enrique described his album as fun and obviously sexual, while some of it is more introspective and nostalgic. He then went on to say: \"The words go together, but they can be separate and inspire different feelings and thoughts. It's all-encompassing. When you turn on the radio, what are the themes that everybody relates to? We all relate to sex and love. That's why when you hear music&nbsp;\u2013 90% of the time&nbsp;\u2013 it derives from those two feelings.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==Release and promotion==\nThis album became available for pre-order on 15 February 2014 through [[Topspin Media]].

The rulers of [[Quilon]], the ''Venattadi Kulasekhara''s, traces their relations back to the [[Ay kingdom]] and the [[Chera dynasty|Later Cheras]]. The last Chera ruler, [[Rama Varma Kulashekhara]], was the first ruler of an independent state of [[Quilon]]. In the early 14th century, King Ravi Varma established a short-lived supremacy over South India. After his death, Quilon only included most of modern-day [[Kollam district|Kollam]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram district|Thiruvananthapuram]] districts of [[Kerala]] and [[Kanyakumari district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]]. [[Marco Polo]] claimed to have visited his capital at [[Quilon]], a centre of commerce and trade with [[China]] and the [[Levant]]. Europeans were attracted to the region during the late fifteenth century, primarily in pursuit of the then rare commodity, [[black pepper]]. [[Quilon]] was the forerunner to [[Travancore]].<ref>Keralam anjum arum noottandukalili, Prof. Ilamkulam Kunjan Pillai</ref>\n\nIn the [[Sangam period|Sangam age]] most of the present-day Kerala state was ruled by the [[Chera dynasty]], [[Ezhimala Kingdom|Ezhimala rulers]] and the [[Ay Kingdom|Ay rulers]]. Venad, ruled by the dynasty of the same name, was in the Ay kingdom. However, the Ays were the vassals of the [[Pandya]]s. By the 9th century, Venad became a part of the Later [[Chera dynasty|Chera Kingdom]] as the Pandya power diminished and traded with distant parts of the world. It became a semi-autonomous state within the Later Chera Kingdom. In the 11th century the region fell under the [[Chola empire]].<ref name=\"Travancore 2011\">\"Travancore.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.

The provincial capital of the local patriarchal dynasty was at port [[Kollam]]. The port was visited by [[Nestorian Christians]], [[China|Chinese]] and [[Arab]]s. In same century, the capital of the war-torn Later Chera Kingdom was relocated to Kollam and the Kulasekhara dynasty merged with the Venad rulers. The last King of the Kulasekhara dynasty based on [[Mahodayapuram]], [[Rama Varma Kulashekhara]], was the first ruler of an independent Venad.

They came as traders and established a trading center at [[Tangasseri]] in [[Quilon]] during 1502. The then Queen of Quilon first invited the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] to the city in 1501 for discussing about spices trade. But they refused that due to [[Vasco da Gama]]'s close relations with the Raja of Cochin. Later the Queen negotiated with the Raja and he permitted to send two Portuguese ships to Quilon to buy fine quality pepper. In 1503, the Portuguese General [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] went to Quilon as per the Queen's request and collected required spices from there.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.keralatourism.org/destination/thangasseri-kollam/296 |title=Kollam - Kerala Tourism |publisher=Kerala Tourism |accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref> It is believed that the [[Colonial India|colonial era in India]] started with the establishment of the Portuguese trading center at Quilon in 1502.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsin.asia/the-ugly-and-good-side-of-conversions-in-south-asia/ |title=The ugly and good side of conversions in South Asia |publisher=NewsIn Asia |date=10 March 2020 |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Factory in Quilon===\n[[File:Thangassery Fort.jpg|right|thumb|[[St Thomas Fort|Fort St Thomas, Tangasseri]]]]\n[[File:Alfonso de Albuquerque II, governor of India.jpg|thumb|Afonso de Albuquerque as governor of India]]\nThe resumption of the pepper blockade seems to have put a crimp in Albuquerque's preparations of the return fleet, much of it having still lacked spice cargoes.  Albuquerque dispatched two ships down to [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam), with the factor Ant\u00f3nio de S\u00e1, to see if more could be procured there - Quilon having been better connected to [[Ceylon]] and points east, its spice supply was not as dependent on the Zamorin's sway and had often invited the Portuguese before.  But soon after their departure, Albuquerque heard that the Zamorin of Calicut was preparing a Calicut fleet of some 30 ships for Quilon.  Afonso de Albuquerque left Cochin and hurried down to Quilon himself.\n\nAlbuquerque arrived in Quilon, and instructed the Portuguese factor to hurry his business along, and sought out an audience with the regent-queen of Quilon.<ref>Barros (p.99), Correia (p.405).  Curiously, Empoli (p.225), who was with the Quilon ships and witnessed the encounter, identifies the ruler as a king, not a queen. Empoli refers to the king \"Nambiadora\", almost certainly a variation of 'Naubeadarim' or 'Naubea Daring', names that can be frequently found in Portuguese chronicles to refer to the royal heirs in other Malabari kingdoms (e.g. Calicut, Cochin) and thus almost certainly a title. i.e. it is possible the 'king' Empoli met was just a royal prince, the queen of Quilon's heir, conducting business on her behalf.</ref>  They were still docked when the Calicut fleet arrived, carrying an embassy from the Zamorin with the mission to persuade (or intimidate) Quilon from abandoning the Portuguese.  The regent queen of Quilon rejected the Zamorin's request, but also forbade Albuquerque from engaging in hostilities in the harbor.  Albuquerque, realizing Quilon was the only spice supply he had access to, acceded to her request. Albuquerque resigned himself to negotiating a commercial treaty and establishing a permanent Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Quilon (the third in India), placing it under factor Ant\u00f3nio de S\u00e1, with two assistants and twenty armed men to protect the factory.<ref>Barros, p.99</ref>  That settled, Albuquerque returned to Cochin on January 12, 1504 to make final preparations for his departure. Albuquerque signed a treaty of friendship with the Royal family of Quilon and established a factory there in 1503 itself. That voyage was the beginning of trade relations between Portugal and city of [[Quilon]], which became the center of their trade in pepper. Soon, Quilon emerged as the richest town of the entire Malabar coast.<ref>{{cite book|title=Shipbuilding, Navigation and the Portuguese in Pre-modern India | year=2018 | publisher=[[Routledge]] | location=United Kingdom | isbn=978-1138094765}}</ref>\n\n===End of the Portuguese era===\nThe trade relation between Quilon and Portuguese got set back due to an insurrection happened at the [[Port of Quilon]] between the [[Arabs]] and the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. The captain of one of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] fleets saw an Arab ship is loading pepper from the port and that burst fighting between them. Aftermath, the battle started between them. 13 [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] men were killed including Ant\u00f3nio de S\u00e1 and the St. Thomas church was burned down. To prevent further devastation, the Queen of Quilon signed a treaty with the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and as a result, they got customs tax exemption and monopoly over the spice and pepper tread with Quilon. The royal family of Quilon agreed to rebuild the destroyed church.<ref>{{cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Asia and Oceania, Volume 5 | year=1994 | publisher=Taylor & Francis | location=United Kingdom | isbn=9781884964053}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/malabar/quilon/quilon.html |title=From a Portuguese atlas, 1630 |publisher=columbia.edu |accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref> \n\nThe Portuguese conquered Quilon till 1661.

They arrived Quilon in the year 1658 and signed a peace treaty in 1659. Thus Quilon became the official protectorate of the Dutch and their officer in-charge, [[Rijcklof van Goens]], placed a military troop in the city to protect it from probable invasions from Portuguese and the British. The West Quilon region including [[Tangasseri]] named as 'Dutch Quilon' then. But English East India Company began to follow the Dutch Method of \"Triangular Trade\" in early 1600s itself. The English signed a trade treaty with Portuguese and gained right to trade across the Portuguese holdings in Asia. During the mid-eighteenth century, [[Travancore]]'s Raja of [[Marthanda Varma]] decided to consolidate various independent kingdoms including Quilon, Kayamkulam and Kottarakkara with [[Kingdom of Travancore]]. The plan was dismissive because of the presence of the Dutch, who fortified their base city of Quilon against such invasions. The Dutch and allies have conquered [[Paravur, Kollam|Paravur]] and marched to [[Attingal]] and despatched another expedition to [[Kottarakkara]] as well. But ignoring the stiff resistance, the army of Marthanda Varma attacked and defeated the Dutch at [[Battle of Colachel|Colachel in 1741]] and marched to Quilon and attacked the city.

Venad, ruled by the dynasty of the same name, was in the Ay kingdom. However, the Ays were the vassals of the [[Pandya]]s. By the 9th century, Venad became a part of the Later [[Chera dynasty|Chera Kingdom]] as the Pandya power diminished and traded with distant parts of the world. It became a semi-autonomous state within the Later Chera Kingdom. In the 11th century the region fell under the [[Chola empire]].<ref name=\"Travancore 2011\">\"Travancore.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.

The provincial capital of the local patriarchal dynasty was at port [[Kollam]]. The port was visited by [[Nestorian Christians]], [[China|Chinese]] and [[Arab]]s. In same century, the capital of the war-torn Later Chera Kingdom was relocated to Kollam and the Kulasekhara dynasty merged with the Venad rulers. The last King of the Kulasekhara dynasty based on [[Mahodayapuram]], [[Rama Varma Kulashekhara]], was the first ruler of an independent Venad.

They came as traders and established a trading center at [[Tangasseri]] in [[Quilon]] during 1502. The then Queen of Quilon first invited the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] to the city in 1501 for discussing about spices trade. But they refused that due to [[Vasco da Gama]]'s close relations with the Raja of Cochin. Later the Queen negotiated with the Raja and he permitted to send two Portuguese ships to Quilon to buy fine quality pepper. In 1503, the Portuguese General [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] went to Quilon as per the Queen's request and collected required spices from there.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.keralatourism.org/destination/thangasseri-kollam/296 |title=Kollam - Kerala Tourism |publisher=Kerala Tourism |accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref> It is believed that the [[Colonial India|colonial era in India]] started with the establishment of the Portuguese trading center at Quilon in 1502.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsin.asia/the-ugly-and-good-side-of-conversions-in-south-asia/ |title=The ugly and good side of conversions in South Asia |publisher=NewsIn Asia |date=10 March 2020 |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Factory in Quilon===\n[[File:Thangassery Fort.jpg|right|thumb|[[St Thomas Fort|Fort St Thomas, Tangasseri]]]]\n[[File:Alfonso de Albuquerque II, governor of India.jpg|thumb|Afonso de Albuquerque as governor of India]]\nThe resumption of the pepper blockade seems to have put a crimp in Albuquerque's preparations of the return fleet, much of it having still lacked spice cargoes.  Albuquerque dispatched two ships down to [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam), with the factor Ant\u00f3nio de S\u00e1, to see if more could be procured there - Quilon having been better connected to [[Ceylon]] and points east, its spice supply was not as dependent on the Zamorin's sway and had often invited the Portuguese before.  But soon after their departure, Albuquerque heard that the Zamorin of Calicut was preparing a Calicut fleet of some 30 ships for Quilon.  Afonso de Albuquerque left Cochin and hurried down to Quilon himself.\n\nAlbuquerque arrived in Quilon, and instructed the Portuguese factor to hurry his business along, and sought out an audience with the regent-queen of Quilon.<ref>Barros (p.99), Correia (p.405).  Curiously, Empoli (p.225), who was with the Quilon ships and witnessed the encounter, identifies the ruler as a king, not a queen. Empoli refers to the king \"Nambiadora\", almost certainly a variation of 'Naubeadarim' or 'Naubea Daring', names that can be frequently found in Portuguese chronicles to refer to the royal heirs in other Malabari kingdoms (e.g. Calicut, Cochin) and thus almost certainly a title. i.e. it is possible the 'king' Empoli met was just a royal prince, the queen of Quilon's heir, conducting business on her behalf.</ref>  They were still docked when the Calicut fleet arrived, carrying an embassy from the Zamorin with the mission to persuade (or intimidate) Quilon from abandoning the Portuguese.  The regent queen of Quilon rejected the Zamorin's request, but also forbade Albuquerque from engaging in hostilities in the harbor.  Albuquerque, realizing Quilon was the only spice supply he had access to, acceded to her request. Albuquerque resigned himself to negotiating a commercial treaty and establishing a permanent Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Quilon (the third in India), placing it under factor Ant\u00f3nio de S\u00e1, with two assistants and twenty armed men to protect the factory.<ref>Barros, p.99</ref>  That settled, Albuquerque returned to Cochin on January 12, 1504 to make final preparations for his departure. Albuquerque signed a treaty of friendship with the Royal family of Quilon and established a factory there in 1503 itself. That voyage was the beginning of trade relations between Portugal and city of [[Quilon]], which became the center of their trade in pepper. Soon, Quilon emerged as the richest town of the entire Malabar coast.<ref>{{cite book|title=Shipbuilding, Navigation and the Portuguese in Pre-modern India | year=2018 | publisher=[[Routledge]] | location=United Kingdom | isbn=978-1138094765}}</ref>\n\n===End of the Portuguese era===\nThe trade relation between Quilon and Portuguese got set back due to an insurrection happened at the [[Port of Quilon]] between the [[Arabs]] and the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. The captain of one of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] fleets saw an Arab ship is loading pepper from the port and that burst fighting between them. Aftermath, the battle started between them. 13 [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] men were killed including Ant\u00f3nio de S\u00e1 and the St. Thomas church was burned down. To prevent further devastation, the Queen of Quilon signed a treaty with the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and as a result, they got customs tax exemption and monopoly over the spice and pepper tread with Quilon. The royal family of Quilon agreed to rebuild the destroyed church.<ref>{{cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Asia and Oceania, Volume 5 | year=1994 | publisher=Taylor & Francis | location=United Kingdom | isbn=9781884964053}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/malabar/quilon/quilon.html |title=From a Portuguese atlas, 1630 |publisher=columbia.edu |accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref> \n\nThe Portuguese conquered Quilon till 1661. They fought with the Arab traders and captured a huge amount of gold after killing more than 2000 Arab traders.

They arrived Quilon in the year 1658 and signed a peace treaty in 1659. Thus Quilon became the official protectorate of the Dutch and their officer in-charge, [[Rijcklof van Goens]], placed a military troop in the city to protect it from probable invasions from Portuguese and the British. The West Quilon region including [[Tangasseri]] named as 'Dutch Quilon' then. But English East India Company began to follow the Dutch Method of \"Triangular Trade\" in early 1600s itself. The English signed a trade treaty with Portuguese and gained right to trade across the Portuguese holdings in Asia. During the mid-eighteenth century, [[Travancore]]'s Raja of [[Marthanda Varma]] decided to consolidate various independent kingdoms including Quilon, Kayamkulam and Kottarakkara with [[Kingdom of Travancore]]. The plan was dismissive because of the presence of the Dutch, who fortified their base city of Quilon against such invasions. The Dutch and allies have conquered [[Paravur, Kollam|Paravur]] and marched to [[Attingal]] and despatched another expedition to [[Kottarakkara]] as well. But ignoring the stiff resistance, the army of Marthanda Varma attacked and defeated the Dutch at [[Battle of Colachel|Colachel in 1741]] and marched to Quilon and attacked the city. After signing the [[Treaty of Mannar]], several territories under Quilon royal family were added to the Travancore Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Dutch Power in Kerala, 1729-1758|origyear=1989|year=2007|publisher=Mittal Publications, New Delhi|isbn=978-81-709-9136-6|pages=61\u201365|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ro8SLhyAc9AC|author=M.
