Utah State University.</ref>\n}}\n'''Habsburg Monarchy''' (or '''''Habsburg Empire''''') is an [[hyponymy|umbrella term]] used by historians for the numerous lands and kingdoms of the [[House of Habsburg]], especially for those of the Austrian line. Although from 1438 until 1806 (with the exception of 1742\u20131745) the head of the House of Habsburg was also [[Holy Roman Emperor]], the Empire itself is not considered a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. \n\nThe formation of the Habsburg Monarchy began with the election of [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] as [[King of Germany]] in 1273 and his acquisition of the [[Duchy of Austria]] for his house in 1282. In 1482, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] acquired the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] through marriage. Both these territories lay within the Empire and passed to his grandson and successor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who also inherited [[Spanish Empire|Spain and its colonies]] and ruled the Habsburg Empire at its greatest territorial extent. The abdication of Charles V in 1556 led to a broad division of the Habsburg holdings between his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], who was his deputy in the Austrian lands since 1521 and the elected king of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] and [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1526\u20131648)|Bohemia]] since 1526, and his son [[Philip II of Spain]]. The Spanish branch (which also held the Netherlands, Burgundy and lands in Italy) went extinct in 1700. The Austrian branch (which also had the Imperial throne and ruled Hungary, Bohemia and all the crowns entailed to them) was itself divided between different branches of the family from 1564 until 1665, but thereafter it remained a single [[personal union]].\n\nThe Habsburg monarchy was thus a union of crowns\u2014with no single constitution or shared institutions outside of the Habsburg court itself\u2014composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The [[composite state]] was the dominant form on the European continent in the early modern era.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Robert I.

Outside the empire it encompassed all the lands of the crown of Hungary, as well as conquests made at the expense of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].

The [[Duchy of Austria]] was part of the elective [[Kingdom of Germany]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. King [[Rudolf I of Germany]] of the Habsburg family assigned the [[Duchy of Austria]] to his sons at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] (1282), thus establishing the \"[[Austrian hereditary lands]]\". From that moment, the Habsburg dynasty was also known as the [[House of Austria]]. Between 1438 and 1806, with few exceptions, the Habsburg [[Archduke of Austria]] was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nThe Habsburgs grew to European prominence as a result of the dynastic policy pursued by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Maximilian I married [[Mary of Burgundy]], thus bringing the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] into the Habsburg inheritance. Their son, [[Philip the Handsome]], married [[Joanna the Mad]] of Spain (daughter of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella of Castile]]). [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (son of Philip and Joanna) inherited the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] in 1506, [[Habsburg Spain]] and its territories in 1516, and [[Habsburg Austria]] in 1519. \n\nAt this point, the Habsburg Empire was so vast that Charles V was constantly travelling throughout his dominions and therefore needed deputies and regents, such as [[Isabella of Portugal]] in Spain and [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]] in the Low Countries, to govern his various realms. At the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, [[Emperor Charles V]] came to terms with his younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]]. According to the [[Habsburg]] ''compact'' of Worms (1521), confirmed a year later in [[Brussels]], Ferdinand was made [[Archduke]] as a regent of Charles V in the Austrian hereditary lands.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GwV_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=Ferdinand+archduke+of+austria+1521#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20archduke%20of%20austria%201521&f=false|title=History of the German speaking nations|date=2019|isbn=9781789017182|language=en|last1=Kanski|first1=Jack J.}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=arSYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&dq=spanish+habsburg+branch+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij-5XLnMLlAhVBzqQKHQ2pBD4Q6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&q=spanish%20habsburg%20branch%201521&f=false]</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of [[Louis II of Hungary]] in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]]  against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], Archduke Ferdinand (who was his brother-in-law by virtue of an adoption treaty signed by Maximilian and Louis at the [[First Congress of Vienna]]) was also elected the next King of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] in 1526.<ref name=\"Britannica2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204416/Ferdinand-I|title=Ferdinand I|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref><ref name=\"HHus\">\"Czech Republic \u2013 Historic Centre of Prague (1992)\" Heindorffhus, August 2007, [http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-CzechRepPrague.htm HeindorffHus-Czech] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070320190321/http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-CzechRepPrague.htm |date=2007-03-20 }}.</ref> Bohemia and Hungary became hereditary Habsburg domains only in the 17th century: Following victory in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620) over the Bohemian rebels, [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] promulgated a ''Renewed Constitution'' (1627) that established hereditary succession over Bohemoa; and following the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs (1687)|Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] (1687), in which [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] reconquered almost all of Hungary from the [[Ottoman Turks]], the emperor held a [[Diet of Hungary|diet in Pressburg]] to establish hereditary succession in the Hungarian kingdom.\n\nCharles V divided the House in 1556 by ceding Austria along with the Imperial crown to Ferdinand (as decided at the [[Imperial election, 1531]]) and the [[Spanish empire]] to his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]].

The Kingdom of Hungary (more exactly the Lands of the Hungarian Crown) was not considered a \"crownland\" after the establishment of Austria-Hungary 1867, so that the \"crownlands\" became identical with what was called the Kingdoms and Lands represented in the Imperial Council (''Die im Reichsrate vertretenen K\u00f6nigreiche und L\u00e4nder'').\n\nThe Hungarian parts of the Empire were called \"[[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]]\" or \"Lands of Holy (St.) Stephen's Crown\" (''L\u00e4nder der Heiligen Stephans Krone''). The Bohemian (Czech) Lands were called \"Lands of the St. Wenceslaus' Crown\" (''L\u00e4nder der Wenzels-Krone'').\n\nNames of some smaller territories:\n* Austrian lands (''\u00d6sterreichische L\u00e4nder'') or \"Archduchies of Austria\" (''Erzherzogt\u00fcmer von \u00d6sterreich'') \u2013 Lands up and below the [[Enns River|Enns]] (''ober und unter der Enns'') (996\u20131918): This is the historical name of the parts of the Archduchy of Austria that became the present-day Republic of Austria (''Republik \u00d6sterreich'') on 12 November 1918 (after Emperor Charles I had abdicated the throne). Modern day Austria is a semi-federal republic of nine states (''Bundesl\u00e4nder'') that are: Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Tyrol, Styria, Salzburg, Carinthia, Vorarlberg and Burgenland and the Capital of Vienna that is a state of its own. [[Burgenland]] came to Austria in 1921 from Hungary. [[Salzburg]] finally became Austrian in 1816 after the Napoleonic wars (before it was ruled by [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|prince-archbishops of Salzburg]] as a sovereign territory).\n:Vienna, Austria's capital became a state 1 January 1922, after being residence and capital of the Austrian Empire (''Reichshaupt und Residenzstadt Wien'') for the Habsburg monarchs for centuries. Upper and Lower Austria, historically, were split into \"Austria above the Enns\" and \"Austria below the Enns\" (the Enns river is the state-border between Upper- and Lower Austria). Upper Austria was enlarged after the [[Treaty of Teschen]] (1779) following the \"War of the Bavarian Succession\" by the so-called [[Innviertel]] (\"[[Inn River|Inn]] Quarter\"), formerly part of Bavaria.\n* [[Hereditary Lands]] (''Erblande'' or ''Erbl\u00e4nder''; mostly used ''\u00d6sterreichische Erblande'') or German Hereditary Lands (in the Austrian monarchy) or Austrian Hereditary Lands ([[Middle Ages]] \u2013 1849/1918): In a narrower sense these were the \"original\" Habsburg Austrian territories, i.e. basically the Austrian lands and [[Carniola]] (not [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], Italian territories or the [[Austrian Netherlands]]).<br /> In a wider sense the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were also included in (from 1526; definitely from 1620/27) the Hereditary lands. The term was replaced by the term \"Crownlands\" (see above) in the 1849 March Constitution, but it was also used afterwards.<br /> The ''Erblande'' also included lots of small and smallest territories that were principalities, duchies or counties etc. some of them can namely be found in the reigning titles of the Habsburg monarchs like ''Graf'' (Earl/Count of) ''von Tyrol'' etc.\n===Territories===\n[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|260px|Growth of the Habsburg Monarchy in Central Europe]]\n[[File:Europe 1783-1792 en.png|thumb|The Habsburg Monarchy at the time of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]'s death in 1790.

To these were added in 1779 the [[Innviertel|Inn Quarter]] of [[Bavaria]] and in 1803 the [[Bishoprics]] of [[Bishopric of Trent|Trent]] and [[Bishopric of Brixen|Brixen]]. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused disruptions where many parts of the Hereditary lands were lost, but all these, along with the former [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]], which had previously been temporarily annexed between 1805 and 1809, were recovered at the peace in 1815, with the exception of the [[Vorlande]].

Until the mid 17th century, not all of the provinces were even necessarily ruled by the same person\u2014junior members of the family often ruled portions of the Hereditary Lands as private apanages. Serious attempts at [[centralization]] began under [[Maria Theresa]] and especially her son [[Joseph II]] in the mid to late 18th century, but many of these were abandoned following large scale resistance to Joseph's more radical reform attempts, although a more cautious policy of centralization continued during the revolutionary period and the [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternichian]] [[Age of Metternich|period]] that followed.\n\nAnother attempt at centralization began in 1849 following the suppression of the various [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolutions of 1848]]. For the first time, ministers tried to transform the monarchy into a centralized bureaucratic state ruled from Vienna. The Kingdom of Hungary was placed under martial law, being divided into a series of military districts, the centralized neo-absolutism tried to as well to nullify Hungary's constitution and Diet. Following the Habsburg defeats in the Wars of 1859 and 1866, these policies were step by step abandoned. \n\nAfter experimentation in the early 1860s, the famous [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] was arrived at, by which the so-called Dual Monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] was set up. In this system, the Kingdom of Hungary (\"Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen.\") was an equal sovereign with only a personal union and a joint foreign and military policy connecting it to the other Habsburg lands. Although the non-Hungarian Habsburg lands were referred to as \"Austria\", received their own central parliament (the ''Reichsrat'', or Imperial Council) and ministries, as their official name \u2013 the \"Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council\". When Bosnia and Herzegovina was [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexed]] (after a long period of [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupation and administration]]), it was not incorporated into either half of the monarchy. Instead, it was governed by the joint [[Ministry of Finance (Austria-Hungary)|Ministry of Finance]].\n\nAustria-Hungary collapsed under the weight of the various unsolved ethnic problems that came to a head with its defeat in [[World War I]]. After its dissolution, the new republics of [[Republic of German-Austria|Austria]] (the German-Austrian territories of the Hereditary lands) and the [[First Hungarian Republic]] were created. In the peace settlement that followed, significant territories were ceded to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the remainder of the monarchy's territory was shared out among the new states of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), and [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\n==Other lines==\nA junior line ruled over the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] between 1765 and 1801, and again from 1814 to 1859. While exiled from Tuscany, this line ruled at Salzburg from 1803 to 1805, and in [[Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg]] from 1805 to 1814. Another line ruled the [[Duchy of Modena]] from 1814 to 1859, while [[Marie Louise of Austria|Empress Marie Louise]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] second wife and the daughter of Austrian Emperor Francis, ruled over the [[Duchy of Parma]] between 1814 and 1847. Also, the [[Second Mexican Empire]], from 1863 to 1867, was headed by [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], the brother of Emperor [[Franz Josef of Austria]].\n\n==Rulers 1508\u20131918==\n{{main|List of rulers of Austria}}\nThe so-called \"Habsburg monarchs\" or \"Habsburg emperors\" held many different titles and ruled each kingdom with a different name and position.\n\n[[File:Giuseppe Arcimboldi 003.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his wife Infanta [[Maria of Spain]] with their children]]\n* [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] 1508\u20131519 \n* [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] 1519\u20131556\n* [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] 1556\u20131564\n* [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] 1564\u20131576\n* [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] 1576\u20131612\n* [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] 1612\u20131619\n* [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] 1619\u20131637\n* [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] 1637\u20131657\n* [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] 1657\u20131705\n* [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] 1705\u20131711\n* [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] 1711\u20131740\n* [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] 1740\u20131780 (German: Maria Theresia)\n\n===Habsburg-Lorraine===\n* [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] 1780\u20131790 known as \"the great Reformer\"\n* [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] 1790\u20131792 from 1765 to 1790 \"Grandduke of Tuscany\"\n* [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] 1792\u20131835 correctly written \"Franz\" (became Emperor Francis I of Austria in 1804, at which point numbering starts anew)\n* [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]] 1835\u20131848 known as \"Ferdinand the Good\" German: \"Ferdinand der G\u00fctige\"\n* [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] 1848\u20131916 Brother of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (ruled 1864\u20131867)\n* [[Karl I of Austria|Charles I]] 1916\u20131918 last reigning Monarch of Austria-Hungary\n* Otto von Habsburg-Lothringen or sometimes called Otto von \u00d6sterreich Crown Prince of Austria to be found as [[Otto von Habsburg]]\n\n===Family tree===\n* [[Habsburg family tree]]\n\n==In literature==\nThe most famous memoir on the decline of the Habsburg Empire is Stefan Zweig's ''[[The World of Yesterday]]''.<ref name=\"Manacorda 2010\">Giorgio Manacorda (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFf-UA19UwC&pg=PT15 ''Nota bibliografica''] in Roth ''La Marcia di Radetzky'', Newton Classici quotation: {{quotation|Stefan Zweig, l'autore del pi\u00f9 famoso libro sull'Impero asburgico, Die Welt von Gestern}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* B\u00e9renger, Jean.

Brandon Hone. Utah State University.</ref>\n}}\n'''Habsburg Monarchy''' (or '''''Habsburg Empire''''') is an [[hyponymy|umbrella term]] used by historians for the lands and kingdoms of the [[House of Habsburg]], especially for those of the Austrian line. Although from 1438 until 1806 (with the exception of 1742\u20131745) the head of the House of Habsburg was also [[Holy Roman Emperor]], the Empire itself is not considered a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. \n\nThe formation of the Habsburg Monarchy began with the election of [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] as [[King of Germany]] in 1273 and his acquisition of the [[Duchy of Austria]] for his house in 1282. In 1482, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] acquired the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] through marriage. Both these territories lay within the Empire and passed to his grandson and successor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who also inherited [[Spanish Empire|Spain and its colonies]] and ruled the Habsburg Empire at its greatest territorial extent. The abdication of Charles V in 1556 led to a broad division of the Habsburg holdings between his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], who was his deputy in the Austrian lands since 1521 and the elected king of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungary]] and [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1526\u20131648)|Bohemia]] since 1526, and his son [[Philip II of Spain]]. The Spanish branch (which also held the Netherlands, Burgundy and lands in Italy) went extinct in 1700. The Austrian branch (which also had the Imperial throne and ruled Hungary, Bohemia and all the crowns entailed to them) was itself divided between different branches of the family from 1564 until 1665, but thereafter it remained a single [[personal union]].\n\nThe Habsburg monarchy was thus a union of crowns\u2014with no single constitution or shared institutions outside of the Habsburg court itself\u2014composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The [[composite state]] was the dominant form on the European continent in the early modern era.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Robert I.

Outside the empire it encompassed all the lands of the crown of Hungary, as well as conquests made at the expense of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. The dynastic capital was [[Vienna]], except from 1583 to 1611, when it was in [[Prague]].<ref name=HHus/>\n\n==Origins and expansion==\n[[File:Augsburg, Silver Medal 600th Anniversary of 1282 Hoftag, obverse.jpg|left|thumb|Silver medal by [[:de:Anton Scharff|Scharff]] commemorating the 600th anniversary of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1882 (obverse)]]\n\nThe Habsburg family originated with the [[Habsburg Castle]] in modern [[Switzerland]], and after 1279 came to rule in [[Austria]]. The [[Duchy of Austria]] was part of the elective [[Kingdom of Germany]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. King [[Rudolf I of Germany]] of the Habsburg family assigned the [[Duchy of Austria]] to his sons at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] (1282), thus establishing the \"[[Austrian hereditary lands]]\". From that moment, the Habsburg dynasty was also known as the [[House of Austria]]. Between 1438 and 1806, with few exceptions, the Habsburg [[Archduke of Austria]] was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nThe Habsburgs grew to European prominence as a result of the dynastic policy pursued by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Maximilian I married [[Mary of Burgundy]], thus bringing the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] into the Habsburg inheritance. Their son, [[Philip the Handsome]], married [[Joanna the Mad]] of Spain (daughter of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella of Castile]]). [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (son of Philip and Joanna) inherited the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] in 1506, [[Habsburg Spain]] and its territories in 1516, and [[Habsburg Austria]] in 1519. \n\nAt this point, the Habsburg Empire was so vast that Charles V was constantly travelling throughout his dominions and therefore needed deputies and regents, such as [[Isabella of Portugal]] in Spain and [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]] in the Low Countries, to govern his various realms. At the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, [[Emperor Charles V]] came to terms with his younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]].

The Kingdom of Hungary (more exactly the Lands of the Hungarian Crown) was not considered a \"crownland\" after the establishment of Austria-Hungary 1867, so that the \"crownlands\" became identical with what was called the Kingdoms and Lands represented in the Imperial Council (''Die im Reichsrate vertretenen K\u00f6nigreiche und L\u00e4nder'').\n\nThe Hungarian parts of the Empire were called \"[[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]]\" or \"Lands of Holy (St.) Stephen's Crown\" (''L\u00e4nder der Heiligen Stephans Krone''). The Bohemian (Czech) Lands were called \"Lands of the St. Wenceslaus' Crown\" (''L\u00e4nder der Wenzels-Krone'').\n\nNames of some smaller territories:\n* Austrian lands (''\u00d6sterreichische L\u00e4nder'') or \"Archduchies of Austria\" (''Erzherzogt\u00fcmer von \u00d6sterreich'') \u2013 Lands up and below the [[Enns River|Enns]] (''ober und unter der Enns'') (996\u20131918): This is the historical name of the parts of the Archduchy of Austria that became the present-day Republic of Austria (''Republik \u00d6sterreich'') on 12 November 1918 (after Emperor Charles I had abdicated the throne). Modern day Austria is a semi-federal republic of nine states (''Bundesl\u00e4nder'') that are: Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Tyrol, Styria, Salzburg, Carinthia, Vorarlberg and Burgenland and the Capital of Vienna that is a state of its own. [[Burgenland]] came to Austria in 1921 from Hungary. [[Salzburg]] finally became Austrian in 1816 after the Napoleonic wars (before it was ruled by [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|prince-archbishops of Salzburg]] as a sovereign territory).\n:Vienna, Austria's capital became a state 1 January 1922, after being residence and capital of the Austrian Empire (''Reichshaupt und Residenzstadt Wien'') for the Habsburg monarchs for centuries. Upper and Lower Austria, historically, were split into \"Austria above the Enns\" and \"Austria below the Enns\" (the Enns river is the state-border between Upper- and Lower Austria). Upper Austria was enlarged after the [[Treaty of Teschen]] (1779) following the \"War of the Bavarian Succession\" by the so-called [[Innviertel]] (\"[[Inn River|Inn]] Quarter\"), formerly part of Bavaria.\n* [[Hereditary Lands]] (''Erblande'' or ''Erbl\u00e4nder''; mostly used ''\u00d6sterreichische Erblande'') or German Hereditary Lands (in the Austrian monarchy) or Austrian Hereditary Lands ([[Middle Ages]] \u2013 1849/1918): In a narrower sense these were the \"original\" Habsburg Austrian territories, i.e. basically the Austrian lands and [[Carniola]] (not [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], Italian territories or the [[Austrian Netherlands]]).<br /> In a wider sense the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were also included in (from 1526; definitely from 1620/27) the Hereditary lands. The term was replaced by the term \"Crownlands\" (see above) in the 1849 March Constitution, but it was also used afterwards.<br /> The ''Erblande'' also included lots of small and smallest territories that were principalities, duchies or counties etc. some of them can namely be found in the reigning titles of the Habsburg monarchs like ''Graf'' (Earl/Count of) ''von Tyrol'' etc.\n===Territories===\n[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|260px|Growth of the Habsburg Monarchy in Central Europe]]\n[[File:Europe 1783-1792 en.png|thumb|The Habsburg Monarchy at the time of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]'s death in 1790. The red line marks the borders of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]\n\nThe territories ruled of the Austrian monarchy changed over the centuries, but the core always consisted of four blocs:\n* The Hereditary Lands, which covered most of the modern states of [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]], as well as territories in northeastern [[Italy]] and (before 1797) southwestern [[Germany]]. To these were added in 1779 the [[Innviertel|Inn Quarter]] of [[Bavaria]] and in 1803 the [[Bishoprics]] of [[Bishopric of Trent|Trent]] and [[Bishopric of Brixen|Brixen]]. The [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused disruptions where many parts of the Hereditary lands were lost, but all these, along with the former [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]], which had previously been temporarily annexed between 1805 and 1809, were recovered at the peace in 1815, with the exception of the [[Vorlande]]. The Hereditary provinces included:\n**[[Archduchy of Austria]] \n*** [[Upper Austria]]\n*** [[Lower Austria]]\n** [[Inner Austria]]\n*** [[Duchy of Styria]]\n*** [[Duchy of Carinthia]]\n*** [[Duchy of Carniola]]\n*** The [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] port of [[Trieste]]\n*** [[March of Istria#Habsburg Margraviate|Margraviate of Istria]] (although much of Istria was [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] territory until 1797)\n*** [[Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca]]\n** [[County of Tyrol]] (although the Bishoprics of Trent and Brixen dominated what would become the South Tyrol before 1803)\n** [[Further Austria]], mostly ruled jointly with Tyrol.\n*** [[Vorarlberg]] (actually a collection of provinces, only united in the 19th century)\n*** The [[Vorlande]], a group of territories in [[Breisgau]] and elsewhere in southwestern Germany lost in 1801 (although the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] territories ([[Sundgau]]) which had formed a part of it had been lost as early as 1648)\n** [[Grand Duchy of Salzburg]] (only after 1805)[[File:Maria Theresa-coronation-1741-Pressburg-Hertz.jpg|thumb|Coronation of Maria Theresa in Pressburg, [[Kingdom of Hungary]], 1741]]\n* The [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]]. The Bohemian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] ({{lang-cs|zemsk\u00fd sn\u011bm}}) elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], later Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, as king in 1526. Initially consisting of the five lands: \n** [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] \n** [[Margraviate of Moravia]]\n** [[Silesia]], Most of Silesia was conquered by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1740\u20131742 and the remnants which stayed under Habsburg sovereignty were ruled as [[Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia]] (Austrian Silesia).\n** [[Lusatia]], was ceded to [[Saxony]] in 1635.\n*** [[Upper Lusatia]]\n*** [[Lower Lusatia]]\n* The [[Kingdom of Hungary]] \u2013 two-thirds of the former territory that was administered by the medieval Kingdom of Hungary was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Princes of vassal Ottoman [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Transylvania]], while the Habsburg administration was restricted to the western and northern territories of the former kingdom, which remained to be officially referred as the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. In 1699, at the end of the [[Ottoman-Habsburg wars]], one part of the territories that were administered by the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary came under Habsburg administration, with some other areas being picked up in 1718 (some of the territories that were part of medieval kingdom, notably those in the south of the Sava and Danube rivers, remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman administration]]).\n*[[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]]\n\n[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Europa regina]]'', symbolizing a Habsburg-dominated Europe]]\n[[File:Kraji\u0161nici, 1756. g.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Military Frontier]] against the incursions of the Ottoman Turks, 1756]]\nOver the course of its history, other lands were, at times, under Austrian Habsburg rule (some of these territories were [[secundogeniture]]s, i.e. ruled by other lines of Habsburg dynasty):\n* [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686\u201391)|Serbia]] occupation (1686\u20131691)\n* [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] (1699\u20131868)\n* [[Transylvania|Grand Principality of Transylvania]], between 1699 ([[Treaty of Karlowitz]]) and 1867 ([[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Ausgleich]])\n* [[Austrian Netherlands]], consisting of most of modern [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] (1713\u20131792)\n* [[Duchy of Milan]] (1713\u20131797)\n* [[Kingdom of Naples]] (1713\u20131735)\n* [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (1713\u20131720)\n* [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718\u201339)|Kingdom of Serbia]] (1718\u20131739)\n* [[Banat of Temeswar]] (1718\u20131778)\n* [[Oltenia]] (1718\u20131739 de facto, 1716\u20131737), as Grand-Voivodate (sometimes designated as ''Valachia Caesarea'')\n* [[Kingdom of Sicily]] (1720\u20131735)\n* [[Duchy of Parma]] (1735\u20131748)\n* [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], in modern [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] (1772\u20131918)\n* [[Duchy of Bukovina]] (1774\u20131918)\n* [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia]] occupation (1788\u20131792)\n* [[New Galicia]], the Polish lands, including [[Krak\u00f3w]], taken in the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] (1795\u20131809)\n* [[Venetian Province|Venetia]] (1797\u20131805)\n* [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] (1797\u20131805, 1814\u20131918)\n* [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]] (1814\u20131859)\n* [[Krak\u00f3w]], which was incorporated into [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] (1846\u20131918)\n* [[Serbian Vojvodina]] (1848\u20131849) de facto entity, officially unrecognized\n* [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]] (1849\u20131860)\n* [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] (1868\u20131918)\n* [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] occupation (1878\u20131913)\n* [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1878\u20131918).\n\nThe boundaries of some of these territories varied over the period indicated, and others were ruled by a subordinate (secundogeniture) Habsburg line. The Habsburgs also held the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] between 1438 and 1740, and again from 1745 to 1806.\n\n===Characteristics===\nWithin the early modern Habsburg Monarchy, each entity was governed according to its own particular customs. Until the mid 17th century, not all of the provinces were even necessarily ruled by the same person\u2014junior members of the family often ruled portions of the Hereditary Lands as private apanages. Serious attempts at [[centralization]] began under [[Maria Theresa]] and especially her son [[Joseph II]] in the mid to late 18th century, but many of these were abandoned following large scale resistance to Joseph's more radical reform attempts, although a more cautious policy of centralization continued during the revolutionary period and the [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternichian]] [[Age of Metternich|period]] that followed.\n\nAnother attempt at centralization began in 1849 following the suppression of the various [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolutions of 1848]]. For the first time, ministers tried to transform the monarchy into a centralized bureaucratic state ruled from Vienna. The Kingdom of Hungary was placed under martial law, being divided into a series of military districts, the centralized neo-absolutism tried to as well to nullify Hungary's constitution and Diet. Following the Habsburg defeats in the Wars of 1859 and 1866, these policies were step by step abandoned. \n\nAfter experimentation in the early 1860s, the famous [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] was arrived at, by which the so-called Dual Monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] was set up. In this system, the Kingdom of Hungary (\"Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen.\") was an equal sovereign with only a personal union and a joint foreign and military policy connecting it to the other Habsburg lands. Although the non-Hungarian Habsburg lands were referred to as \"Austria\", received their own central parliament (the ''Reichsrat'', or Imperial Council) and ministries, as their official name \u2013 the \"Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council\". When Bosnia and Herzegovina was [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexed]] (after a long period of [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupation and administration]]), it was not incorporated into either half of the monarchy. Instead, it was governed by the joint [[Ministry of Finance (Austria-Hungary)|Ministry of Finance]].\n\nAustria-Hungary collapsed under the weight of the various unsolved ethnic problems that came to a head with its defeat in [[World War I]]. After its dissolution, the new republics of [[Republic of German-Austria|Austria]] (the German-Austrian territories of the Hereditary lands) and the [[First Hungarian Republic]] were created. In the peace settlement that followed, significant territories were ceded to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the remainder of the monarchy's territory was shared out among the new states of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), and [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\n==Other lines==\nA junior line ruled over the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] between 1765 and 1801, and again from 1814 to 1859. While exiled from Tuscany, this line ruled at Salzburg from 1803 to 1805, and in [[Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg]] from 1805 to 1814. Another line ruled the [[Duchy of Modena]] from 1814 to 1859, while [[Marie Louise of Austria|Empress Marie Louise]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] second wife and the daughter of Austrian Emperor Francis, ruled over the [[Duchy of Parma]] between 1814 and 1847. Also, the [[Second Mexican Empire]], from 1863 to 1867, was headed by [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], the brother of Emperor [[Franz Josef of Austria]].\n\n==Rulers 1508\u20131918==\n{{main|List of rulers of Austria}}\nThe so-called \"Habsburg monarchs\" or \"Habsburg emperors\" held many different titles and ruled each kingdom with a different name and position.\n\n[[File:Giuseppe Arcimboldi 003.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his wife Infanta [[Maria of Spain]] with their children]]\n* [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] 1508\u20131519 \n* [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] 1519\u20131556\n* [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] 1556\u20131564\n* [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] 1564\u20131576\n* [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] 1576\u20131612\n* [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] 1612\u20131619\n* [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] 1619\u20131637\n* [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] 1637\u20131657\n* [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] 1657\u20131705\n* [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] 1705\u20131711\n* [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] 1711\u20131740\n* [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] 1740\u20131780 (German: Maria Theresia)\n\n===Habsburg-Lorraine===\n* [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] 1780\u20131790 known as \"the great Reformer\"\n* [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] 1790\u20131792 from 1765 to 1790 \"Grandduke of Tuscany\"\n* [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] 1792\u20131835 correctly written \"Franz\" (became Emperor Francis I of Austria in 1804, at which point numbering starts anew)\n* [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]] 1835\u20131848 known as \"Ferdinand the Good\" German: \"Ferdinand der G\u00fctige\"\n* [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] 1848\u20131916 Brother of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (ruled 1864\u20131867)\n* [[Karl I of Austria|Charles I]] 1916\u20131918 last reigning Monarch of Austria-Hungary\n* Otto von Habsburg-Lothringen or sometimes called Otto von \u00d6sterreich Crown Prince of Austria to be found as [[Otto von Habsburg]]\n\n===Family tree===\n* [[Habsburg family tree]]\n\n==In literature==\nThe most famous memoir on the decline of the Habsburg Empire is Stefan Zweig's ''[[The World of Yesterday]]''.<ref name=\"Manacorda 2010\">Giorgio Manacorda (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFf-UA19UwC&pg=PT15 ''Nota bibliografica''] in Roth ''La Marcia di Radetzky'', Newton Classici quotation: {{quotation|Stefan Zweig, l'autore del pi\u00f9 famoso libro sull'Impero asburgico, Die Welt von Gestern}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* B\u00e9renger, Jean.

The length of copyright established by the Founding Fathers was short, 14 years, plus the ability to renew it one time, for 14 more. [[Copyright Act of 1831|40 years later]], it was changed to 28 years. It was not until a full 180 years after its establishment that it was significantly extended beyond that, in [[Copyright Act of 1976]] to \"Either 75 years or the life of the author plus 50 years\" and the Sonny Bono [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998 (also called the \"Mickey Mouse Protection Act\", because it prevented the copyright from expiring on the first commercial success of the cartoon character Mickey Mouse), which increased it even more, to 120 years, or the life of the author plus 70 years.\n\n==Purpose of copyright==\n{{rquote|right|The Congress shall have Power [...] to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.|[[United States Constitution]]}}\nThe goal of copyright law, as set forth in the [[Copyright Clause]] of the [[US Constitution]], is \"to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\"<ref>U.S. Constitution, Article 1 section 8</ref> This includes incentivizing the creation of art, literature, architecture, music, and other works of authorship.

This distinction is called the [[Idea\u2013expression divide|idea\u2013expression dichotomy]].<ref>[[Baker v. Selden]], 101 U.S. 99 (1879); see also CDN Inc. v. Kapes, 197 F.3d 1256, 1261\u201362 (9th Cir. 1999).</ref> The distinction between \"idea\" and \"expression\" is fundamental to copyright law. From the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|17|102}}):\n{{quote|In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.}}\n\nFor example, a paper describing a political theory is copyrightable. The paper is the ''expression'' of the author's ideas about the political theory. The theory itself is just an ''idea'', and is not copyrightable. Another author is free to describe the same theory in their own words without infringing on the original author's copyright.<ref>Richard H. Jones.

However, ''compilations of facts'' are treated differently, and may be copyrightable material.  The Copyright Act, {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|103}},  allows copyright protection for \"compilations\", as long as there is some \"creative\" or \"original\" act involved in developing the compilation, such as in the selection (deciding which facts to include or exclude), and arrangement (how facts are displayed and in what order). Copyright protection in compilations is limited to the ''selection and arrangement of facts'', not to the facts themselves.\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'' clarified the requirements for copyright in compilations. The Feist case denied copyright protection to a \"white pages\" phone book (a compilation of telephone numbers, listed alphabetically). In making this ruling, the Supreme Court rejected the \"[[sweat of the brow]]\" doctrine. That is, copyright protection requires creativity, and no amount of hard work (\"sweat of the brow\") can transform a non-creative list (like an alphabetical listing of phone numbers) into copyrightable subject matter. A mechanical, non-selective collection of facts (e.g., alphabetized phone numbers) cannot be protected by copyright.<ref name=\"works.bepress.com\">Bryan M. Carson.

Likewise, the US government can purchase and hold the copyright to works created by third parties.\n\nThe government may restrict access to works it has produced through other mechanisms. For instance, confidential or secret materials are not protected by copyright, but are restricted by other applicable laws. However, even in case of non-secret materials there are specific prohibitions against automatic access to work otherwise covered under {{UnitedStatesCode|17|105}} for commercial purposes.<ref>For example, the current [[Seal of the President of the United States]] is in public domain as a government work, but its commercial use is limited by {{UnitedStatesCode|18|713}}.</ref>\n\n===Federal and state laws are not protected by copyright===\n{{main article|Edict of government}}\nFederal statutes are in the [[public domain]] and no copyright attaches to them.

Registration is required before a lawsuit can be filed, and registration creates the possibility for enhanced \"statutory\" damages.\n\nA copyright can be registered online at the US Copyright Office's website.

The Copyright Office does not compare the author\u2019s new work against a collection of existing works or otherwise check for infringement.\n\n===Deposit requirement===\nThe United States Copyright Office requires a deposit copy of the work for which copyright registration is sought. Deposits can be made through the Copyright Office's [http://www.copyright.gov/eco/ eCO System]. This deposit requirement serves two purposes. First, if a copyright infringement lawsuit arises, the owner may prove that the material that is infringed is exactly the same material for which the owner has secured a registration. Second, this requirement helps the Library of Congress build its collection of works.\n\nFailure to comply with the deposit requirement, as modified by Copyright Office regulations, is punishable by fine, but does not result in forfeiture of copyright.\n\n===Copyright notices===\n{{main article|Copyright notice}}\n\nThe use of copyright notices is optional.

Upon the effective date of the 1976 Copyright Act (which was January 1, 1978) this requirement was removed and these unpublished, unregistered works received protection. However, Congress intended to provide an incentive for these authors to publish their unpublished works. To provide that incentive, these works, if published before 2003, would not have their protection expire before 2048.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain|title=Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States {{!}} Copyright Information Center|website=copyright.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref>\n\nAll copyrightable works published in the United States before {{#time:Y|now -95 years}} are in the [[public domain]];<ref name=\":0\" /> works created but not published or copyrighted before January 1, 1978 may be protected until 2047.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|303}}</ref> For works that received their copyright before 1978, a renewal had to be filed in the work's 28th year with the Copyright Office for its term of protection to be extended. The need for renewal was eliminated by the [[Copyright Renewal Act of 1992]], but works that had already entered the public domain by non-renewal did not regain copyright protection. Therefore, works published before 1964 that were not renewed are in the public domain.\n\nBefore 1972, sound recordings were not subject to federal copyright, but copying was nonetheless regulated under various state [[tort]]s and statutes, some of which had no duration limit. The Sound Recording Amendment of 1971 extended federal copyright to recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972, and declared that recordings fixed before that date would remain subject to state or [[common law]] copyright. Subsequent amendments had extended this latter provision until 2067.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|301}}</ref> As a result, older sound recordings were not subject to the expiration rules that applied to contemporary visual works. Although these could have entered the public domain as a result of government authorship or formal grant by the owner, the practical effect has been to render public domain audio virtually nonexistent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jaszi |first1=Peter |last2=Lewis |first2=Nick |title=Protection for Pre-1972 Sound Recordings under State Law and Its Impact on Use by Nonprofit Institutions: A 10-State Analysis |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-recording-preservation-plan/publications-and-reports/documents/pub146.pdf |website=Library of Congress |publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources and Library of Congress |date=September 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThis situation has changed with the 2018 enactment of the [[Music Modernization Act]], which extended federal copyright protection to all sound recordings, regardless of their date of creation, and preempted state copyright laws on those works.

It is codified at {{UnitedStatesCode|17|107}}, and states that \"the fair use of a copyrighted work ... is not an infringement of copyright.\"  The section lists four factors that must be assessed to determine whether a particular use is fair.  There are no [[bright-line rule]]s regarding fair use and each determination is made on an individualized case-by-case basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/|title = Measuring Fair Use: The Four Factors|date = |accessdate = March 15, 2017|website =Stanford University Libraries |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n#''Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes'':  Nonprofit educational and noncommercial uses are more likely to be fair use.  This does ''not'' mean that all nonprofit education and noncommercial uses are fair use or that all commercial uses are not fair. Instead, courts will balance the purpose and character of the use against the other factors below.  Additionally, \u201c'''transformative'''\u201d uses are more likely to be considered fair.  Transformative uses are those that add something new, with a further purpose or different character, and do not substitute for the original use of the work.\n#''Nature of the copyrighted work'':  Using a more creative or imaginative work (such as a novel, movie, or song) is ''less'' likely to support fair use than using a factual work (such as a technical article or news item). In addition, use of an unpublished work is less likely to be considered fair.\n#''Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole'':  Courts look at both the quantity and quality of the copyrighted material that was used. Using a large portion of the copyrighted work is less likely to be fair use. However, courts have occasionally found use of an ''entire'' work to be fair use, and in other contexts, using even a small amount of a copyrighted work was determined not to be fair use because the selection was an important part\u2014or the \u201cheart\u201d\u2014of the work.\n#''Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work'':  Here, courts review whether, and to what extent, the unlicensed use harms the existing or future market for the copyright owner\u2019s original work. In assessing this factor, courts consider whether the use is hurting the current market for the original work (for example, by displacing sales of the original) and/or whether the use could cause substantial harm if it were to become widespread.\n\nIn addition to these four factors, the statute also allows courts to consider any other factors that may be relevant to the fair use analysis. Courts evaluate fair use claims on a case-by-case basis, and the outcome of any given case depends on the specific facts of that case. There is ''no formula'' to ensure that a predetermined percentage or amount of a work\u2014or specific number of words, lines, pages, copies\u2014may be used without permission.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html|title = More Information on Fair Use|date = April 2015|accessdate = April 29, 2015|website =copyright.gov |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThe justification of the fair use doctrine turns primarily on whether, and to what extent, the challenged use is ''transformative''. \"The use must be productive and must employ the quoted matter in a different manner or for a different purpose from the original. A quotation of copyrighted material that merely repackages or republishes the original is unlikely to pass the test.... If, on the other hand, the secondary use adds value to the original\u2014if the quoted matter is used as raw material, transformed in the creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings\u2014this is the very type of activity that the fair use doctrine intends to protect for the enrichment of society.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/levalfrustd.htm|title = Toward a Fair Use Standard|last = Leval|first = Pierre|date = 1990|journal = Harvard Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-05-05}}</ref>\n\nThe Copyright Office provides a searchable list of fair use case law.<ref>{{cite web|title=Search Cases|url=http://copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html|website=Copyright.gov|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Parodies===\nAlthough a [[parody]] can be considered a derivative work, and thus within the exclusive rights of the copyright owner, it may qualify as \"fair use.\"  Parodies are not automatically fair use. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] stated that parody (transformative) \"is the use of some elements of a prior author's composition to create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that author's works.\" That commentary function provides some justification for use of the older work; in contrast, a satire (exaggerated) (which is not targeted at the work borrowed from) does not require use of the original work to make its point. (See ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'').<ref name=\"works.bepress.com\"/>\n\n==Infringement==\nCopyright infringement occurs when someone violates one of the exclusive rights listed in 17 USC 106. Commonly, this involves someone creating or distributing a \"copy\" of a protected work that is \"substantially similar\" to the original version.\n\nInfringement requires copying. If two people happen to write exactly the same story,  without knowledge of the other, there is no infringement.\n\n===Copyright infringement litigation===\n\nA copyright owner may bring a copyright infringement lawsuit in federal court. Federal courts have ''exclusive'' [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] over copyright infringement cases.<ref>[[Title 28 of the United States Code|28 U.S.C.]] {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|28|1338}}</ref>  That is, an infringement case may not be brought in ''state'' courts. (With an exception for works not protected under Federal law, but are protected under state law, e.g. state laws prohibiting copying of sound recordings made before February 15, 1972.) Note that the Copyright Office handles copyright registrations, but it does not adjudicate copyright infringement disputes.\n\n==== Ownership of valid copyright ====\nTo bring a copyright infringement lawsuit, a copyright holder must establish ownership of a valid copyright and the copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.<ref>''see [[Feist v. Rural|Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'' 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991)</ref> The copyright owner must also establish both (a) actual copying and (b) improper appropriation of the work.  The copyright owner, as plaintiff, bears the burden of establishing these three elements of the ''[[prima facie]]'' case for infringement.\n\nA [[plaintiff]] establishes ownership by authorship (by the plaintiff itself or by someone who assigned rights to the plaintiff) of (1) an ''original'' work of authorship that is (2) fixed in a tangible medium (e.g. a book, musical recording, etc.).\n\nRegistration is not required to establish copyright protection, but registration is necessary before bringing a lawsuit. Registration is also useful because it creates a presumption of a ''valid'' copyright, it allows the plaintiff to collect enhanced \"statutory damages\", and to be eligible for an award of attorney fees.\n\nA plaintiff establishes \"actual copying\" with direct or indirect evidence.  Direct evidence is satisfied either by a defendant's admission to copying or the testimony of witnesses who observed the defendant in the act.  More commonly, a plaintiff relies on circumstantial or indirect evidence.  A court will infer copying by a showing of a \"'''striking similarity'''\" between the copyrighted work and the alleged copy, along with a showing of both '''access''' and use of that access.<ref>''see Ty, Inc. v. GMA Accessories, Inc.'' 132 F.3d 1167 (7th Cir. 1997).</ref>  A plaintiff may establish \"access\" by proof of distribution over a large geographical area, or by eyewitness testimony that the defendant owned a copy of the protected work.  Access alone is not sufficient to establish infringement.  The plaintiff must show a similarity between the two works, and the degree of similarity will affect the probability that illicit copying in fact occurred in the court's eyes.<ref>''Id.'' 132 F.3d 1167</ref>  Even then, the plaintiff must show that the copying amounted to improper appropriation.  Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held that not all copying constitutes infringement and a showing of misappropriation is necessary.<ref>''see Feist'' at 361</ref>\n\n==== Misappropriation ====\nA copyrighted work may contain elements which are not copyrightable, such as facts, ideas, themes, or content in the [[public domain]].  A plaintiff alleging misappropriation must first demonstrate that what the defendant appropriated from the copyrighted work was protectible.  Second, a plaintiff must show that the '''intended audience''' will recognize '''[[substantial similarity|substantial similarities]]''' between the two works.  The intended audience may be the general public, or a specialized field.  The degree of similarity necessary for a court to find misappropriation is not easily defined.  Indeed, \"the test for infringement of a copyright is of necessity vague.\"<ref>Judge [[Learned Hand]], ''Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp.'', 274 F.2d 487, 489 (2nd Cir. 1960).</ref>\n\nTwo methods are used to determine if unlawful appropriation has occurred: the \"subtractive method\" and the \"totality method\".\n\nThe '''subtractive method''', also known as the \"abstraction/subtraction approach\" seeks to analyze what parts of a copyrighted work are protectible and which are not.<ref>''see Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.'', 45 F.2d 119 (2nd Cir. 1930)</ref>  The unprotected elements are ''subtracted'' and the fact finder then determines whether substantial similarities exist in the protectible expression which remains.  For instance, if the copyright holder for ''[[West Side Story]]'' alleged infringement, the elements of that musical borrowed from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' would be subtracted before comparing it to the allegedly infringing work because ''Romeo and Juliet'' exists in the public domain.\n\nThe '''totality method''', also known as the \"total concept and feel\" approach takes the work as a whole with all elements included when determining if a substantial similarity exists.\nThis was first formulated in ''[[Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co.]]'' (1970).<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv\n |last=Lehman|first=Bruce A. |page=104\n |title=Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure: The Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1vERuaJxIgC&pg=PA104\n |accessdate=2012-06-23|date=1995-10-01|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0-7881-2415-0}}</ref>  \nThe individual elements of the alleged infringing work may by themselves be substantially different from their corresponding part in the copyrighted work, but nevertheless taken together be a clear misappropriation of copyrightable material.<ref>''see [[Sid & Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.]]'', 562 F.2d 1157 (9th Cir. 1977) (holding that a series of [[McDonald's]] commercials portraying \"McDonaldland\" had used as its basis the \"H.R. Pufnstuf\" television show.  Corresponding characters to each, while displaying marked differences, taken altogether demonstrated that McDonald's had captured the total concept and feel of the show and had thus infringed).</ref>\n\nModern courts may sometimes use both methods in its analysis of misappropriation.<ref>''see [[Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group]]'', 150 F.3d 132, 140 (2nd Cir. 1998).</ref>  In other instances, one method may find misappropriation while the other would not, making misappropriation a contentious topic in infringement litigation.<ref>''see Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.'', 982 F.2d 693, (2nd Cir. 1992) (where court chose the subtraction method for two computer programs whose total concept were the same.  Individual copied elements of the program were non-protectible material because they constituted a process or idea in the program, their utilitarian aspects barring copyright protection; no infringement found).</ref>\n\n===Civil remedies===\nA successful copyright infringement plaintiff may seek both \"injunctive relief\" and monetary [[damages]]. As of 2019, the United States Supreme Court has held that a copyright holder must register his copyright with the U.S. copyright office before he may seek any judicial remedies for infringement. <ref>Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com LLC et al.  586 U.S. ___ , 139 S. Ct. 881; 203 L. Ed. 2d 147; 129 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1453 (2019). </ref> \n\n'''Injunctions''': Copyright Act \u00a7 502 authorizes courts to grant both preliminary and permanent injunctions against copyright infringement. There are also provisions for impounding allegedly infringing copies and other materials used to infringe, and for their destruction.\n\n'''Damages and/or Profits''': Copyright Act \u00a7 504 gives the copyright owner a choice of recovering: (1) their actual damages and any additional profits of the defendant; or (2) statutory damages.\n\nHowever, Title 17 [[United States Code]] \u00a7411(a) states that a civil action to enforce a copyright claim in a US work cannot be made until the work has been registered with the U.S. Copyright Office, with a narrow exception if the claim was filed and rejected by the Copyright Office.<ref>{{USCSub|17|411|a}}</ref><ref name=\"Litman SCOTUSblog\">{{cite news |last1=Litman |first1=Jessica |title=Opinion analysis: A copyright owner can\u2019t sue for infringement before the Register has processed its copyright registration application |url=https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/03/opinion-analysis-a-copyright-owner-cant-sue-for-infringement-before-the-register-has-processed-its-copyright-registration-application/ |accessdate=5 March 2019 |work=[[SCOTUSblog]] |date=March 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court [[Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v.

One form of equitable relief that is available in copyright cases is a '''seizure order'''. At any time during the lawsuit, the court may order the impoundment of any and all copies of the infringing products. The seizure order may include materials used to produce such copies, such as master tapes, film negatives, printing plates, etc.  Items that are impounded during the course of the lawsuit can, if the plaintiff wins, be ordered destroyed as part of the final decree.\n\n====Monetary damages====\n\nA copyright holder can also seek monetary damages. Injunctions and damages are not [[mutually exclusive]]. One can have injunctions and no damages, or damages and no injunctions, or both injunctions and damages. There are two types of damages: actual damages and profits, or statutory damages.<ref name=\"sec#504\">{{UnitedStatesCode|17|504}}</ref>\n\nThe copyright owner may recover the profits he or she would have earned absent the infringement (actual damages) and any profits the infringer might have made as a result of the infringement but that are not already considered in calculating actual damages.<ref name=\"sec#504\" /> To recover actual damages, the plaintiff must prove to the court that, in the absence of the infringement, the plaintiff would have been able to make additional sales, or perhaps been able to charge higher prices, and that this would have resulted in profits given the owner's cost structure.<ref>Gordon V. Smith & Russel L. Parr, \"Intellectual Property: Valuation, Exploitation, and Infringement Damages,\" John Wiley & Sons, 2005, pp 617\u2013630.</ref>  In some cases, the profits earned by the infringer exploiting the copyrighted material may exceed those earned by or potentially available to the owner.  In these circumstances, the copyright owner can recover the infringer's profits if he or she can demonstrate a nexus between the profits and the infringing use.<ref>R. B. Troxel and W.O. Kerr, \"Assets and Finance: Calculating Intellectual Property Damages\", West, 2014, pp 462-472.</ref>\n\n[[Statutory damages for copyright infringement|Statutory damages]] are available as an alternative to actual damages and profits.<ref name = \"sect#504c\"/> If the copyright was registered either (a) within three months of publication or (b) before the infringement, then the plaintiff is eligible to seek statutory damages.<ref name=\"sect#504c\"/>  Statutory damages can be awarded by the court within the range of $750 to $30,000, but this can be lowered if the infringement is deemed inadvertent, or increased significantly if the infringement is willful.<ref>See, ''inter alia'', http://ipmetrics.net/blog/2010/06/17/copyright-infringement-damages/</ref>\n\nStatutory damages are sometimes preferable for the plaintiff if actual damages and profits are either too small, or too difficult to prove, or both.  There are, however, situations where statutory damages are not available. {{UnitedStatesCode|17|412}} provides:\n* Statutory damages are not available if the work is unpublished and the infringement began before the effective date of its [[Copyright registration|registration]].\n* Statutory damages are not available if the work is published but the infringement commenced after the first publication and before the effective date of its registration, unless registration is made within three months after the first publication.\nStatutory damages are calculated per work infringed.<ref name=\"sect#504c\">{{UnitedStatesCode|17|504(c)}}</ref> According to clause (1) of Title 17, U.S.C. Section 504(c), statutory damages range from $750 per work to $30,000 per work, with two principal exceptions:\n* In case of \"innocent infringement\", the amount may be reduced to a sum \"not less than $200\" for an effective range of $200 to $30,000 per work. \"Innocent\" is a technical term. In particular, if the work carries a copyright notice, the infringer cannot claim innocence.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|17|402|d}}</ref>\n* In case of \"willful infringement\" (again, \"willful\" is a technical term), statutory damages can be no more than $150,000 for an effective range of $750 to $150,000 per work.<ref name=\"sect#504c\"/>\n\nDamages in copyright cases can be very high. In ''Lowry's Reports, Inc. v. Legg Mason Inc.'',<ref>Lowry's Reports, Inc. v. Legg Mason Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 737 (D. Md. 2003)</ref> a 2003 lawsuit between a publisher of stock analysis newsletters against a company that buys one copy of the newsletters and makes multiple copies for use in-house, the jury awarded damages \u2013 actual damages for some newsletters and statutory damages for other newsletters \u2013 totaling $20 million.\n\n====Attorney's fees====\n\nCost and attorney fees: Copyright Act \u00a7 505 permits courts, in their discretion, to award costs against either party and to award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party. The court may (but is not required to) award to the \"prevailing party\" reasonable attorney's fees.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|505}}</ref> This applies to both a winning plaintiff (copyright owner) and a winning defendant (accused infringer).<ref>''Fogerty v.

There are also criminal sanctions for fraudulent copyright notice, fraudulent removal of copyright notice, and false representations in applications for copyright registration. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] imposes criminal sanctions for certain acts of circumvention and interference with copyright management information. There are not criminal sanctions for violating the rights of attribution and integrity held by the author of a work of visual art.\n\nCriminal penalties for copyright infringement include:\n* A [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] of not more than $500,000 or [[prison|imprisonment]] for not more than five years, or both, for the first [[Crime|offense]].\n* A fine of not more than $1 million or imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or both, for repeated offenses.\n[[Nonprofit organization|Nonprofit]] libraries, archives, [[school|education institutions]] and [[public broadcasting]] entities are exempt from criminal prosecution.\n\nFelony penalties for first offenses begin at seven copies for audiovisual works, and one hundred copies for sound recordings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/71mcrm.htm|title=9-71.000 - Copyright Law|work=justice.gov}}</ref>\n\n===Government infringement===\nThe U.S. government, its agencies and officials, and corporations owned or controlled by it, are subject to suit for copyright infringement.

The elimination of registration also eliminated a central recording location to track and identify copyright-holders. Consequently, potential users of copyrighted works, e.g., filmmakers or biographers, must assume that many works they might use are copyrighted.  Where the planned use would not be otherwise permitted by law (for example, by [[fair use]]), they must themselves individually investigate the copyright status of each work they plan to use.  With no central database of copyright-holders, identifying and contacting copyright-holders can sometimes be difficult; those works that fall into this category may be considered \"orphaned\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Too many see alsos|date=August 2017}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Ashcan copy]]\n*[[Bilateral copyright agreements of the United States]]\n*[[Copyfraud]]\n*[[Copyright Catalog]]\n*[[Copyright Clearance Center]]\n*[[Copyright misuse]]\n*[[Fair Use Project]]\n*[[International Copyright Act]]\n*[[No Electronic Theft Act]]\n*[[Public Domain Enhancement Act]]\n*[[TEACH Act]]\n*[[United States copyright law in the performing arts]]\n*[[United States patent law]]\n*[[United States trademark law]]\n*[[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]]\n*[[Visual Artists Rights Act]]\n}}\n\n===Cases===\n* {{section link|List of copyright case law|United States}}\n\n'''Fixation'''\n* ''[[White-Smith Music Publishing Company v.

Copyright law grants authors and artists the exclusive right to make and sell copies of their works, the right to create derivative works, and the right to perform or display their works publicly. These exclusive rights are subject to a time limit, and generally expire 70 years after the author's death. In the United States, any music composed before January 1, 1924, is generally considered public domain.\n\nUnited States [[copyright]] law was last generally revised by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], codified in [[Title 17 of the United States Code]]. The United States Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to create copyright law under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8, known<ref>Stanford Fair Use and Copyright Center.

The length of copyright established by the Founding Fathers was short, 14 years, plus the ability to renew it one time, for 14 more. [[Copyright Act of 1831|40 years later]], it was changed to 28 years. It was not until a full 180 years after its establishment that it was significantly extended beyond that, in [[Copyright Act of 1976]] to \"Either 75 years or the life of the author plus 50 years\" and the Sonny Bono [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998 (also called the \"Mickey Mouse Protection Act\", because it prevented the copyright from expiring on the first commercial success of the cartoon character Mickey Mouse), which increased it even more, to 120 years, or the life of the author plus 70 years.\n\n==Purpose of copyright==\n{{rquote|right|The Congress shall have Power [...] to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.|[[United States Constitution]]}}\nThe goal of copyright law, as set forth in the [[Copyright Clause]] of the [[US Constitution]], is \"to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\"<ref>U.S. Constitution, Article 1 section 8</ref> This includes incentivizing the creation of art, literature, architecture, music, and other works of authorship.

Kapes, 197 F.3d 1256, 1261\u201362 (9th Cir. 1999).</ref> The distinction between \"idea\" and \"expression\" is fundamental to copyright law. From the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|17|102}}):\n{{quote|In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.}}\n\nFor example, a paper describing a political theory is copyrightable. The paper is the ''expression'' of the author's ideas about the political theory. The theory itself is just an ''idea'', and is not copyrightable. Another author is free to describe the same theory in their own words without infringing on the original author's copyright.<ref>Richard H. Jones.

Reasonable people can disagree about where the unprotectable \"idea\" ends and the protectable \"expression\" begins. As Judge [[Learned Hand]] put it, \"Obviously, no principle can be stated as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the 'idea,' and has borrowed its 'expression.' Decisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc.\"<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7909069540715359056 Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v.

However, ''compilations of facts'' are treated differently, and may be copyrightable material.  The Copyright Act, {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|103}},  allows copyright protection for \"compilations\", as long as there is some \"creative\" or \"original\" act involved in developing the compilation, such as in the selection (deciding which facts to include or exclude), and arrangement (how facts are displayed and in what order). Copyright protection in compilations is limited to the ''selection and arrangement of facts'', not to the facts themselves.\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'' clarified the requirements for copyright in compilations. The Feist case denied copyright protection to a \"white pages\" phone book (a compilation of telephone numbers, listed alphabetically). In making this ruling, the Supreme Court rejected the \"[[sweat of the brow]]\" doctrine. That is, copyright protection requires creativity, and no amount of hard work (\"sweat of the brow\") can transform a non-creative list (like an alphabetical listing of phone numbers) into copyrightable subject matter. A mechanical, non-selective collection of facts (e.g., alphabetized phone numbers) cannot be protected by copyright.<ref name=\"works.bepress.com\">Bryan M. Carson.

The specific language is as follows:\n\n{{quote|Copyright protection under this title is not available for any work of the United States Government, but the United States Government is not precluded from receiving and holding copyrights transferred to it by assignment, bequest, or otherwise.}}\n\nA \"work of the United States Government\" is defined in {{UnitedStatesCode|17|101}} as work prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that person's official duties. Note that government contractors are generally not considered employees, and their works may be subject to copyright. Likewise, the US government can purchase and hold the copyright to works created by third parties.\n\nThe government may restrict access to works it has produced through other mechanisms. For instance, confidential or secret materials are not protected by copyright, but are restricted by other applicable laws. However, even in case of non-secret materials there are specific prohibitions against automatic access to work otherwise covered under {{UnitedStatesCode|17|105}} for commercial purposes.<ref>For example, the current [[Seal of the President of the United States]] is in public domain as a government work, but its commercial use is limited by {{UnitedStatesCode|18|713}}.</ref>\n\n===Federal and state laws are not protected by copyright===\n{{main article|Edict of government}}\nFederal statutes are in the [[public domain]] and no copyright attaches to them.

If the person doing the work is an \"employee\" within the meaning of the common law, and the work was done within the scope of their employment (whether the work is the kind they were employed to prepare; whether the preparation takes place primarily within the employer's time and place specifications; and whether the work was activated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer), then the work is a work for hire and the employer is the initial owner of the copyright.<ref>Bryan M.

Nonexclusive licenses need not be in writing and they may be implied by the circumstances. Transfers of copyright always involve one or more of the ''exclusive rights'' of copyright.

Registration is not necessary. However, registration amplifies a copyright holder's rights in a number of ways. Registration is required before a lawsuit can be filed, and registration creates the possibility for enhanced \"statutory\" damages.\n\nA copyright can be registered online at the US Copyright Office's website. The Copyright Office reviews applications for obvious errors or lack of copyrightable subject matter, and then issues a certificate of registration. The Copyright Office does not compare the authors new work against a collection of existing works or otherwise check for infringement.\n\n===Deposit requirement===\nThe United States Copyright Office requires a deposit copy of the work for which copyright registration is sought. Deposits can be made through the Copyright Office's [http://www.copyright.gov/eco/ eCO System]. This deposit requirement serves two purposes. First, if a copyright infringement lawsuit arises, the owner may prove that the material that is infringed is exactly the same material for which the owner has secured a registration. Second, this requirement helps the Library of Congress build its collection of works.\n\nFailure to comply with the deposit requirement, as modified by Copyright Office regulations, is punishable by fine, but does not result in forfeiture of copyright.\n\n===Copyright notices===\n{{main article|Copyright notice}}\n\nThe use of copyright notices is optional. The [[Berne Convention]], amending US copyright law in 1989, makes copyright automatic.<ref>[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf U.S. Copyright Office \u2013 Information Circular<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, the lack of notice of copyright using these marks may have consequences in terms of reduced damages in an infringement lawsuit\u2014using notices of this form may reduce the likelihood of a defense of \"innocent infringement\" being successful.<ref name=\"USC, 17, 401 (d)\" >[[Title 17 of the United States Code|17 U.S.C.]] {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|401(d)}}</ref>\n\n==Duration of copyright==\n[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|right|500px|Expansion of U.S. [[copyright term]] (assuming authors create their works at age 35 and live for seventy years)]]\nCopyright protection generally lasts for 70 years after the death of the author. If the work was a \"work for hire\", then copyright persists for 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever is shorter. For works created before 1978, the copyright duration rules are complicated. However, works created before 1924 (other than sound recordings) have made their way into the public domain.\n\n===Works created before 1978===\nFor works published or registered before 1978, the maximum copyright duration is 95 years from the date of publication, if copyright was renewed during the 28th year following publication.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|304}}</ref> [[Copyright renewal]] has been automatic since the [[Copyright Renewal Act of 1992]].\n\nFor works created before 1978, but not published or registered before 1978, the standard \u00a7302 copyright duration of 70 years from the author's death also applies.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|302}}</ref> Prior to 1978, works had to be published or registered to receive copyright protection. Upon the effective date of the 1976 Copyright Act (which was January 1, 1978) this requirement was removed and these unpublished, unregistered works received protection. However, Congress intended to provide an incentive for these authors to publish their unpublished works. To provide that incentive, these works, if published before 2003, would not have their protection expire before 2048.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain|title=Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States {{!}} Copyright Information Center|website=copyright.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref>\n\nAll copyrightable works published in the United States before {{#time:Y|now -95 years}} are in the [[public domain]];<ref name=\":0\" /> works created but not published or copyrighted before January 1, 1978 may be protected until 2047.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|303}}</ref> For works that received their copyright before 1978, a renewal had to be filed in the work's 28th year with the Copyright Office for its term of protection to be extended. The need for renewal was eliminated by the [[Copyright Renewal Act of 1992]], but works that had already entered the public domain by non-renewal did not regain copyright protection. Therefore, works published before 1964 that were not renewed are in the public domain.\n\nBefore 1972, sound recordings were not subject to federal copyright, but copying was nonetheless regulated under various state [[tort]]s and statutes, some of which had no duration limit. The Sound Recording Amendment of 1971 extended federal copyright to recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972, and declared that recordings fixed before that date would remain subject to state or [[common law]] copyright. Subsequent amendments had extended this latter provision until 2067.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|301}}</ref> As a result, older sound recordings were not subject to the expiration rules that applied to contemporary visual works. Although these could have entered the public domain as a result of government authorship or formal grant by the owner, the practical effect has been to render public domain audio virtually nonexistent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jaszi |first1=Peter |last2=Lewis |first2=Nick |title=Protection for Pre-1972 Sound Recordings under State Law and Its Impact on Use by Nonprofit Institutions: A 10-State Analysis |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-recording-preservation-plan/publications-and-reports/documents/pub146.pdf |website=Library of Congress |publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources and Library of Congress |date=September 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThis situation has changed with the 2018 enactment of the [[Music Modernization Act]], which extended federal copyright protection to all sound recordings, regardless of their date of creation, and preempted state copyright laws on those works.

It is codified at {{UnitedStatesCode|17|107}}, and states that \"the fair use of a copyrighted work ... is not an infringement of copyright.\"  The section lists four factors that must be assessed to determine whether a particular use is fair.  There are no [[bright-line rule]]s regarding fair use and each determination is made on an individualized case-by-case basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/|title = Measuring Fair Use: The Four Factors|date = |accessdate = March 15, 2017|website =Stanford University Libraries |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n#''Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes'':  Nonprofit educational and noncommercial uses are more likely to be fair use.  This does ''not'' mean that all nonprofit education and noncommercial uses are fair use or that all commercial uses are not fair. Instead, courts will balance the purpose and character of the use against the other factors below.  Additionally, \u201c'''transformative'''\u201d uses are more likely to be considered fair.  Transformative uses are those that add something new, with a further purpose or different character, and do not substitute for the original use of the work.\n#''Nature of the copyrighted work'':  Using a more creative or imaginative work (such as a novel, movie, or song) is ''less'' likely to support fair use than using a factual work (such as a technical article or news item). In addition, use of an unpublished work is less likely to be considered fair.\n#''Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole'':  Courts look at both the quantity and quality of the copyrighted material that was used. Using a large portion of the copyrighted work is less likely to be fair use. However, courts have occasionally found use of an ''entire'' work to be fair use, and in other contexts, using even a small amount of a copyrighted work was determined not to be fair use because the selection was an important part\u2014or the \u201cheart\u201d\u2014of the work.\n#''Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work'':  Here, courts review whether, and to what extent, the unlicensed use harms the existing or future market for the copyright owner\u2019s original work. In assessing this factor, courts consider whether the use is hurting the current market for the original work (for example, by displacing sales of the original) and/or whether the use could cause substantial harm if it were to become widespread.\n\nIn addition to these four factors, the statute also allows courts to consider any other factors that may be relevant to the fair use analysis. Courts evaluate fair use claims on a case-by-case basis, and the outcome of any given case depends on the specific facts of that case. There is ''no formula'' to ensure that a predetermined percentage or amount of a work\u2014or specific number of words, lines, pages, copies\u2014may be used without permission.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html|title = More Information on Fair Use|date = April 2015|accessdate = April 29, 2015|website =copyright.gov |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThe justification of the fair use doctrine turns primarily on whether, and to what extent, the challenged use is ''transformative''. \"The use must be productive and must employ the quoted matter in a different manner or for a different purpose from the original. A quotation of copyrighted material that merely repackages or republishes the original is unlikely to pass the test.... If, on the other hand, the secondary use adds value to the original\u2014if the quoted matter is used as raw material, transformed in the creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings\u2014this is the very type of activity that the fair use doctrine intends to protect for the enrichment of society.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/levalfrustd.htm|title = Toward a Fair Use Standard|last = Leval|first = Pierre|date = 1990|journal = Harvard Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-05-05}}</ref>\n\nThe Copyright Office provides a searchable list of fair use case law.<ref>{{cite web|title=Search Cases|url=http://copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html|website=Copyright.gov|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Parodies===\nAlthough a [[parody]] can be considered a derivative work, and thus within the exclusive rights of the copyright owner, it may qualify as \"fair use.\"  Parodies are not automatically fair use. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] stated that parody (transformative) \"is the use of some elements of a prior author's composition to create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that author's works.\" That commentary function provides some justification for use of the older work; in contrast, a satire (exaggerated) (which is not targeted at the work borrowed from) does not require use of the original work to make its point. (See ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'').<ref name=\"works.bepress.com\"/>\n\n==Infringement==\nCopyright infringement occurs when someone violates one of the exclusive rights listed in 17 USC 106. Commonly, this involves someone creating or distributing a \"copy\" of a protected work that is \"substantially similar\" to the original version.\n\nInfringement requires copying. If two people happen to write exactly the same story,  without knowledge of the other, there is no infringement.\n\n===Copyright infringement litigation===\n\nA copyright owner may bring a copyright infringement lawsuit in federal court. Federal courts have ''exclusive'' [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] over copyright infringement cases.<ref>[[Title 28 of the United States Code|28 U.S.C.]] {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|28|1338}}</ref>  That is, an infringement case may not be brought in ''state'' courts. (With an exception for works not protected under Federal law, but are protected under state law, e.g. state laws prohibiting copying of sound recordings made before February 15, 1972.) Note that the Copyright Office handles copyright registrations, but it does not adjudicate copyright infringement disputes.\n\n==== Ownership of valid copyright ====\nTo bring a copyright infringement lawsuit, a copyright holder must establish ownership of a valid copyright and the copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.<ref>''see [[Feist v. Rural|Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'' 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991)</ref> The copyright owner must also establish both (a) actual copying and (b) improper appropriation of the work.  The copyright owner, as plaintiff, bears the burden of establishing these three elements of the ''[[prima facie]]'' case for infringement.\n\nA [[plaintiff]] establishes ownership by authorship (by the plaintiff itself or by someone who assigned rights to the plaintiff) of (1) an ''original'' work of authorship that is (2) fixed in a tangible medium (e.g. a book, musical recording, etc.).\n\nRegistration is not required to establish copyright protection, but registration is necessary before bringing a lawsuit. Registration is also useful because it creates a presumption of a ''valid'' copyright, it allows the plaintiff to collect enhanced \"statutory damages\", and to be eligible for an award of attorney fees.\n\nA plaintiff establishes \"actual copying\" with direct or indirect evidence.  Direct evidence is satisfied either by a defendant's admission to copying or the testimony of witnesses who observed the defendant in the act.  More commonly, a plaintiff relies on circumstantial or indirect evidence.  A court will infer copying by a showing of a \"'''striking similarity'''\" between the copyrighted work and the alleged copy, along with a showing of both '''access''' and use of that access.<ref>''see Ty, Inc. v. GMA Accessories, Inc.'' 132 F.3d 1167 (7th Cir. 1997).</ref>  A plaintiff may establish \"access\" by proof of distribution over a large geographical area, or by eyewitness testimony that the defendant owned a copy of the protected work.  Access alone is not sufficient to establish infringement.  The plaintiff must show a similarity between the two works, and the degree of similarity will affect the probability that illicit copying in fact occurred in the court's eyes.<ref>''Id.'' 132 F.3d 1167</ref>  Even then, the plaintiff must show that the copying amounted to improper appropriation.  Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held that not all copying constitutes infringement and a showing of misappropriation is necessary.<ref>''see Feist'' at 361</ref>\n\n==== Misappropriation ====\nA copyrighted work may contain elements which are not copyrightable, such as facts, ideas, themes, or content in the [[public domain]].  A plaintiff alleging misappropriation must first demonstrate that what the defendant appropriated from the copyrighted work was protectible.  Second, a plaintiff must show that the '''intended audience''' will recognize '''[[substantial similarity|substantial similarities]]''' between the two works.  The intended audience may be the general public, or a specialized field.  The degree of similarity necessary for a court to find misappropriation is not easily defined.  Indeed, \"the test for infringement of a copyright is of necessity vague.\"<ref>Judge [[Learned Hand]], ''Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp.'', 274 F.2d 487, 489 (2nd Cir. 1960).</ref>\n\nTwo methods are used to determine if unlawful appropriation has occurred: the \"subtractive method\" and the \"totality method\".\n\nThe '''subtractive method''', also known as the \"abstraction/subtraction approach\" seeks to analyze what parts of a copyrighted work are protectible and which are not.<ref>''see Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.'', 45 F.2d 119 (2nd Cir. 1930)</ref>  The unprotected elements are ''subtracted'' and the fact finder then determines whether substantial similarities exist in the protectible expression which remains.  For instance, if the copyright holder for ''[[West Side Story]]'' alleged infringement, the elements of that musical borrowed from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' would be subtracted before comparing it to the allegedly infringing work because ''Romeo and Juliet'' exists in the public domain.\n\nThe '''totality method''', also known as the \"total concept and feel\" approach takes the work as a whole with all elements included when determining if a substantial similarity exists.\nThis was first formulated in ''[[Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co.]]'' (1970).<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv\n |last=Lehman|first=Bruce A. |page=104\n |title=Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure: The Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1vERuaJxIgC&pg=PA104\n |accessdate=2012-06-23|date=1995-10-01|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0-7881-2415-0}}</ref>  \nThe individual elements of the alleged infringing work may by themselves be substantially different from their corresponding part in the copyrighted work, but nevertheless taken together be a clear misappropriation of copyrightable material.<ref>''see [[Sid & Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.]]'', 562 F.2d 1157 (9th Cir. 1977) (holding that a series of [[McDonald's]] commercials portraying \"McDonaldland\" had used as its basis the \"H.R. Pufnstuf\" television show.  Corresponding characters to each, while displaying marked differences, taken altogether demonstrated that McDonald's had captured the total concept and feel of the show and had thus infringed).</ref>\n\nModern courts may sometimes use both methods in its analysis of misappropriation.<ref>''see [[Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group]]'', 150 F.3d 132, 140 (2nd Cir. 1998).</ref>  In other instances, one method may find misappropriation while the other would not, making misappropriation a contentious topic in infringement litigation.<ref>''see Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.'', 982 F.2d 693, (2nd Cir. 1992) (where court chose the subtraction method for two computer programs whose total concept were the same.  Individual copied elements of the program were non-protectible material because they constituted a process or idea in the program, their utilitarian aspects barring copyright protection; no infringement found).</ref>\n\n===Civil remedies===\nA successful copyright infringement plaintiff may seek both \"injunctive relief\" and monetary [[damages]]. As of 2019, the United States Supreme Court has held that a copyright holder must register his copyright with the U.S. copyright office before he may seek any judicial remedies for infringement. <ref>Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com LLC et al.  586 U.S. ___ , 139 S. Ct. 881; 203 L. Ed. 2d 147; 129 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1453 (2019). </ref> \n\n'''Injunctions''': Copyright Act \u00a7 502 authorizes courts to grant both preliminary and permanent injunctions against copyright infringement. There are also provisions for impounding allegedly infringing copies and other materials used to infringe, and for their destruction.\n\n'''Damages and/or Profits''': Copyright Act \u00a7 504 gives the copyright owner a choice of recovering: (1) their actual damages and any additional profits of the defendant; or (2) statutory damages.\n\nHowever, Title 17 [[United States Code]] \u00a7411(a) states that a civil action to enforce a copyright claim in a US work cannot be made until the work has been registered with the U.S. Copyright Office, with a narrow exception if the claim was filed and rejected by the Copyright Office.<ref>{{USCSub|17|411|a}}</ref><ref name=\"Litman SCOTUSblog\">{{cite news |last1=Litman |first1=Jessica |title=Opinion analysis: A copyright owner can\u2019t sue for infringement before the Register has processed its copyright registration application |url=https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/03/opinion-analysis-a-copyright-owner-cant-sue-for-infringement-before-the-register-has-processed-its-copyright-registration-application/ |accessdate=5 March 2019 |work=[[SCOTUSblog]] |date=March 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court [[Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v.

Wall-Street.com|source=j|docket=17-571|volume=586|date=March 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Equitable relief====\n\nBoth temporary and permanent injunctions are available to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.<ref name=\"Section 502\">{{UnitedStatesCode|17|502}}</ref> An \"injunction\" is a court order directing the defendant to stop doing something (e.g., stop selling infringing copies).  One form of equitable relief that is available in copyright cases is a '''seizure order'''. At any time during the lawsuit, the court may order the impoundment of any and all copies of the infringing products. The seizure order may include materials used to produce such copies, such as master tapes, film negatives, printing plates, etc.  Items that are impounded during the course of the lawsuit can, if the plaintiff wins, be ordered destroyed as part of the final decree.\n\n====Monetary damages====\n\nA copyright holder can also seek monetary damages. Injunctions and damages are not [[mutually exclusive]]. One can have injunctions and no damages, or damages and no injunctions, or both injunctions and damages. There are two types of damages: actual damages and profits, or statutory damages.<ref name=\"sec#504\">{{UnitedStatesCode|17|504}}</ref>\n\nThe copyright owner may recover the profits he or she would have earned absent the infringement (actual damages) and any profits the infringer might have made as a result of the infringement but that are not already considered in calculating actual damages.<ref name=\"sec#504\" /> To recover actual damages, the plaintiff must prove to the court that, in the absence of the infringement, the plaintiff would have been able to make additional sales, or perhaps been able to charge higher prices, and that this would have resulted in profits given the owner's cost structure.<ref>Gordon V. Smith & Russel L. Parr, \"Intellectual Property: Valuation, Exploitation, and Infringement Damages,\" John Wiley & Sons, 2005, pp 617\u2013630.</ref>  In some cases, the profits earned by the infringer exploiting the copyrighted material may exceed those earned by or potentially available to the owner.  In these circumstances, the copyright owner can recover the infringer's profits if he or she can demonstrate a nexus between the profits and the infringing use.<ref>R. B. Troxel and W.O. Kerr, \"Assets and Finance: Calculating Intellectual Property Damages\", West, 2014, pp 462-472.</ref>\n\n[[Statutory damages for copyright infringement|Statutory damages]] are available as an alternative to actual damages and profits.<ref name = \"sect#504c\"/> If the copyright was registered either (a) within three months of publication or (b) before the infringement, then the plaintiff is eligible to seek statutory damages.<ref name=\"sect#504c\"/>  Statutory damages can be awarded by the court within the range of $750 to $30,000, but this can be lowered if the infringement is deemed inadvertent, or increased significantly if the infringement is willful.<ref>See, ''inter alia'', http://ipmetrics.net/blog/2010/06/17/copyright-infringement-damages/</ref>\n\nStatutory damages are sometimes preferable for the plaintiff if actual damages and profits are either too small, or too difficult to prove, or both.  There are, however, situations where statutory damages are not available. {{UnitedStatesCode|17|412}} provides:\n* Statutory damages are not available if the work is unpublished and the infringement began before the effective date of its [[Copyright registration|registration]].\n* Statutory damages are not available if the work is published but the infringement commenced after the first publication and before the effective date of its registration, unless registration is made within three months after the first publication.\nStatutory damages are calculated per work infringed.<ref name=\"sect#504c\">{{UnitedStatesCode|17|504(c)}}</ref> According to clause (1) of Title 17, U.S.C. Section 504(c), statutory damages range from $750 per work to $30,000 per work, with two principal exceptions:\n* In case of \"innocent infringement\", the amount may be reduced to a sum \"not less than $200\" for an effective range of $200 to $30,000 per work. \"Innocent\" is a technical term. In particular, if the work carries a copyright notice, the infringer cannot claim innocence.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|17|402|d}}</ref>\n* In case of \"willful infringement\" (again, \"willful\" is a technical term), statutory damages can be no more than $150,000 for an effective range of $750 to $150,000 per work.<ref name=\"sect#504c\"/>\n\nDamages in copyright cases can be very high. In ''Lowry's Reports, Inc. v. Legg Mason Inc.'',<ref>Lowry's Reports, Inc. v. Legg Mason Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 737 (D. Md. 2003)</ref> a 2003 lawsuit between a publisher of stock analysis newsletters against a company that buys one copy of the newsletters and makes multiple copies for use in-house, the jury awarded damages \u2013 actual damages for some newsletters and statutory damages for other newsletters \u2013 totaling $20 million.\n\n====Attorney's fees====\n\nCost and attorney fees: Copyright Act \u00a7 505 permits courts, in their discretion, to award costs against either party and to award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party. The court may (but is not required to) award to the \"prevailing party\" reasonable attorney's fees.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|505}}</ref> This applies to both a winning plaintiff (copyright owner) and a winning defendant (accused infringer).<ref>''Fogerty v. Fantasy'', {{ussc|510|517|1994}}</ref> However, attorney's fees award is not available against the government.  Like statutory damages, attorney's fees are not available if the work infringed is not registered at the time of infringement.\n\n===Criminal penalties===\n{{main article|Criminal Copyright Law in the United States}}\nIn addition to the civil remedies, the Copyright Act provides for criminal prosecution in some cases of willful copyright infringement. There are also criminal sanctions for fraudulent copyright notice, fraudulent removal of copyright notice, and false representations in applications for copyright registration. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] imposes criminal sanctions for certain acts of circumvention and interference with copyright management information. There are not criminal sanctions for violating the rights of attribution and integrity held by the author of a work of visual art.\n\nCriminal penalties for copyright infringement include:\n* A [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] of not more than $500,000 or [[prison|imprisonment]] for not more than five years, or both, for the first [[Crime|offense]].\n* A fine of not more than $1 million or imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or both, for repeated offenses.\n[[Nonprofit organization|Nonprofit]] libraries, archives, [[school|education institutions]] and [[public broadcasting]] entities are exempt from criminal prosecution.\n\nFelony penalties for first offenses begin at seven copies for audiovisual works, and one hundred copies for sound recordings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/71mcrm.htm|title=9-71.000 - Copyright Law|work=justice.gov}}</ref>\n\n===Government infringement===\nThe U.S. government, its agencies and officials, and corporations owned or controlled by it, are subject to suit for copyright infringement.  All infringement claims against the U.S. that did not arise in a foreign country must be filed with the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]] within three years of the infringing action.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|28|1498|b}}-{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|28|1498|c|pipe=(c)}}.</ref> Claims filed in the wrong court are dismissed for lack of [[subject-matter jurisdiction]].  The government and its agencies are also authorized to settle the infringement claims out of court.\n\nThe states have [[sovereign immunity in the United States|sovereign immunity]] provided by the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which bars most forms of lawsuits against states in federal courts, but can be abrogated in certain circumstances by Congress.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Congressional Research Service |title=U.S. Constitution Annotated: State Sovereign Immunity |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-11/state-sovereign-immunity |website=Cornell University Legal Information Institute |publisher=Government Printing Office}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Feller |first1=Mitchell |title=IP and Sovereign Immunity: Why You Can\u2019t Always Sue for IP Infringement |url=http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2018/02/01/ip-infringement-sovereign-immunity/id=93050/ |website=IPWatchdog.com |accessdate=5 March 2019 |date=February 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Peters |first1=Marybeth |title=Statement of Marybeth Peters, The Register of Copyrights, before the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary |url=https://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat72700.html |website=Copyright.gov |publisher=U.S. Copyright Office |accessdate=5 March 2019 |date=July 27, 2000}}</ref> The Copyright Remedy and Clarification Act of 1990 (CRCA) states in part that states are liable to copyright infringement \"in the same manner and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity\"<ref>{{USCSub|17|501|a}}</ref> and also that states and state entities and officials \"shall not be immune, under the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or under any other doctrine of sovereign immunity, from suit in Federal Court by any person\"<ref>{{USCSub|17|511|a}}</ref> alleging copyright infringement.<ref name=\"Allen v Cooper cert pet\">[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-877/78314/20190104141658343_2019.01.04_Allen%20v.%20Cooper_Petition%20for%20Certiorari.pdf Pet. for a writ of cert.], ''Allen v.

For example, (a) the copyright protecting the work may have expired, or (b) the owner may have explicitly donated the work to the public, or (c) the work is not the type of work that copyright can protect.\n\n== Orphan works ==\n{{main article|Orphan works in the United States}}\nThe \"[[orphan works]]\" problem arose in the United States with the enactment of the Copyright Act of 1976, which eliminated the need to register copyrighted works, instead declaring that all \"original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression\"<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|17|102}}.</ref> fall into copyright status. The elimination of registration also eliminated a central recording location to track and identify copyright-holders. Consequently, potential users of copyrighted works, e.g., filmmakers or biographers, must assume that many works they might use are copyrighted.  Where the planned use would not be otherwise permitted by law (for example, by [[fair use]]), they must themselves individually investigate the copyright status of each work they plan to use.  With no central database of copyright-holders, identifying and contacting copyright-holders can sometimes be difficult; those works that fall into this category may be considered \"orphaned\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Too many see alsos|date=August 2017}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Ashcan copy]]\n*[[Bilateral copyright agreements of the United States]]\n*[[Copyfraud]]\n*[[Copyright Catalog]]\n*[[Copyright Clearance Center]]\n*[[Copyright misuse]]\n*[[Fair Use Project]]\n*[[International Copyright Act]]\n*[[No Electronic Theft Act]]\n*[[Public Domain Enhancement Act]]\n*[[TEACH Act]]\n*[[United States copyright law in the performing arts]]\n*[[United States patent law]]\n*[[United States trademark law]]\n*[[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]]\n*[[Visual Artists Rights Act]]\n}}\n\n===Cases===\n* {{section link|List of copyright case law|United States}}\n\n'''Fixation'''\n* ''[[White-Smith Music Publishing Company v.

{"title_page": "Justice delayed is justice denied", "text_new": "{{short description|Legal maxim}}\n'''\"Justice delayed is justice denied\"''' is a [[legal maxim]] meaning that if [[Legal remedy|legal redress]] or [[Equitable relief|equitable relief]] is available for a party that has suffered some injury, but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion, it is effectively the same as having no redress at all. This principle is the basis for the right to a [[speedy trial]] and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because it is unfair for the injured party to have to sustain the injury with little hope for resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for [[law reform|legal reformers]] who view [[court]]s or [[government]]s as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour. When a court takes a matter \"under advisement\" {{ndash}} awaiting the issuance of a [[judicial opinion]], [[Court order|order]] or [[judgement]] and forestalls [[Adjudication|adjudication]] {{ndash}} the issue of timeliness of the decision comes into play.\n\n== Origin ==\nThere are conflicting accounts of who first noted the phrase. According to ''Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations'', it is attributable to [[William Ewart Gladstone]], but such attribution was not verifiable.<ref>Suzy Platt (ed.).

[[Nachmanides]] understands the advice given by [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]] in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 18:22, to judge the people at all times, as suggesting that Israel needed more judges because potential litigants would otherwise suffer injustice due to their inability to find a judge to hear their case.<ref>[http://tmt.urj.net/archives/4jewishethics/052605.htm 10 Minutes of Torah.

It was even smaller and more reddish in color, without dark spots. Both subspecies were nominated by the Spanish-born zoologist [[\u00c1ngel Cabrera (naturalist)|\u00c1ngel Cabrera]] in 1907.\n\nThe Iberian wolf's skull [[morphometrics]], [[mtDNA]], and [[microsatellite]]s differ from other European wolves.<ref name=ramirez2006/> In 2016, a study of mitochondrial [[DNA sequences]] of both modern and ancient wolves indicated that in Europe, the two most genetically distinct haplotypes form the [[Italian wolf]], and separately, the Iberian wolf.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\nThe [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]/[[Genbank]] lists the Iberian wolf under ''Canis lupus signatus''.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Canis Lupus Signatus (1).JPG|thumb|left|upright|White stripes on the snouts and black marks on the front legs are distinguishing markings of the subspecies]]\n[[File:Iberian Wolf.jpg|thumb|Alpha male Iberian wolf with blood stains in its snout]]\n[[File:Canis lupus signatus - 01.jpg|thumb|Iberian wolf with summer fur in [[Captivity|semi-captivity]] in the [[Community of Madrid]]]]\n[[File:Iberian Wolf 02.jpg|thumb|Iberian wolf pups stimulating the alpha female to regurgitate]]\n\nCabrera identified two types of wolves living in Spain. In comparison, ''C. l. lupus'' had a pale, undefined stroke on the cheek that contrasts with the white on the throat; ''C. l. signatus'' had a white stroke on the cheek that joins the white throat and with a reddish snout; and ''C. l. deitanus'' was much smaller and with more colouring than the wolves to the north. ''C. l. signatus'' is described as being 140-180&nbsp;cm in head and body length, and 70-80&nbsp;cm height at the shoulders.<ref name=cabrera1907/>\n\nThe Iberian wolf differs from the more common [[Eurasian wolf]] with its slighter frame, white marks on the upper lips, the dark marks on the tail, and a pair of dark marks in its front legs that give it its subspecies name, ''signatus'' (\"marked\"). The subspecies differentiation may have developed at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] [[Ice Age]]s due to the isolation of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] when [[glacier]] barriers grew in the [[Pyrenees]] and eventually reached the [[Gulf of Biscay]] in the west and the [[Mediterranean]] in the east.\n\nMales can weigh 30-50&nbsp;kg, although up to 75 kg have been found.Females have dimensions and weight lower than those of males.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.faunaiberica.org/lobo-iberico |title=Lobo ib\u00e9rico |language=es |website=faunaiberica.org}}</ref>\n\n==Diet==\nThe Iberian wolf lives in small packs. It is considered to be beneficial because it keeps the population of [[wild boar]]s stable, thus allowing some respite to the endangered [[capercaillie]] populations which suffer greatly from boar predation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iberianature.com/material/Wolves_boars_capercaillie.htm |title=Wolves, boars and capercaillie |website=IberiaNature |date=Dec 2004 |access-date=2012-12-31}}</ref> It also eats [[rabbit]]s, [[Roe Deer|roe deer]], [[Red Deer|red deer]], [[Spanish Ibex|ibexes]] and even small [[carnivore]]s and [[fish]].\n\n==Distribution and conservation==\nWolf populations strongly declined across Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries largely due to human persecution, and by the end of the [[Second World War]] they had been eradicated from all of [[Central Europe]] and almost all of [[Nordic countries|Northern Europe]]. Their population decline continued until the 1960s, with isolated populations surviving in [[Italy]], Spain, Portugal, [[Greece]], and [[Finland]]. Wolf populations have commenced recovering naturally since then.<ref name=randi2007/>\n\n[[File:Lobo ib\u00e9rico.jpg|thumb|left|Iberian wolf in [[Tudela de Duero]], Spain]]\n\nThe Iberian wolf consists of over 2,000 individuals in over 350 packs distributed across 140,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. \nTheir densities in some regions are among the highest in Europe, with up to 7 wolves/100\u2009km<sup>2</sup>. In 2018, a study identified that this wolf could be categorised into 11 genetic groups. Four groups were identified in the Portuguese regions of [[Alto Minho]], western [[Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes (region)|Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes]], eastern Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes, and one group located south of the [[Douro river]].

Today, the hunting of wolves is banned in Portugal, but allowed in some parts of Spain. The 2003 census estimated the total Iberian population to be 2,000 wolves.<ref name=ques131112/> Wolves have been reported as returning to [[Navarre]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and to the provinces of [[Extremadura]], [[Madrid]], and [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]]. A male wolf was found recently in [[Catalonia]], where the last native wolf was killed in 1929. However, this animal was not a member of the Iberian subspecies, but an [[Italian wolf]] (''C. l. italicus'') migrating from [[France]]. As of 2013, an estimated 300 individuals remain in Portugal.<ref name=ptj131108/>\n\nIn October 2013, Ecologists in Action called for an urgent review of the Iberian wolf census, which may overestimate their numbers.<ref name=TI131003/> Later that month, wolf association Lobo Marley sent 198,000 signatures calling for the animal's protection to the [[European Parliament Committee on Petitions]].<ref name=EFE131014/> Over a few weeks in September and October 2013, about 30 puppies and young wolves were killed by hunters in Asturias, Le\u00f3n, and Cantabria.<ref name=ques131112/>\n\nAlthough hunting is banned in Portugal, about 45% of wolf deaths are due to human activities, including illegal hunting.<ref name=ptj131108/> Calling the rate unsustainable, 10 organisations signed a statement requesting stronger protection.<ref name=ptj131108/>\n\n===Southern population===\n[[Sierra Morena]] is a system of rugged mountain ranges in the south of the Iberian Peninsula where a very small wolf population has lived in isolation for half a century. A breeding pair of wolves was last sighted in 2013, however an extensive survey in 2016 could not find a breeding population. The DNA of a road-killed wolf from 2003 indicated high levels of inbreeding and 30% of the [[genome]] being that of dog. It is thought that as the population of these wolves declined, the inability to find a mate led to inbreeding and hybridization with dogs. The wolves in this region may now be extinct.<ref name=gomez2018/>\n\n[[File:Canis lupus footprints.jpg|thumb|Iberian wolf footprints in the snow]]\n\n==2009 controversy==\n\nIn 2009, a picture taken by a Spanish photographer of an Iberian wolf leaping over a [[cattle-pen]] in [[Avila, Spain|\u00c1vila]] won the prestigious [[Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year|Wildlife Photograph of the Year]] award.

Nonetheless, very few hunting permits are given every year, strictly north of the [[Douro river]].<ref>[https://elpais.com/sociedad/2012/03/25/actualidad/1332693965_033377.html]</ref> Along with the difficulty of their hunt by virtue of their vigilant nature and the rarity of their sightings, they are strongly desired by many European hunters as a [[Trophy hunting|big-game trophy]].<ref>[http://www.jlvg.es/Publicaciones/Gestion_lobo_EEC.pdf] Jos\u00e9 Luis Vicente Gonz\u00e1lez: La gesti\u00f3n del lobo ib\u00e9rico (Canis Iupus signatus Cabrera, 1907), en una poblaci\u00f3n \u201cestable\u201d p. 237</ref><ref>[https://www.academia.edu/27506307/Lobo_saltando_sobre_cerca] Cr\u00f3nicas de Cuenca: Lobo saltando sobre cerca. p. 2</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Iberian wolf ''Canis lupus signatus'' Cabrera 1907<ref name=cabrera1907/> is classified as ''Canis lupus lupus'' by ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]''.<ref name=wozencraft2005/> Some authors claim that the south-eastern Spanish wolf, last sighted in [[Murcia]] in the 1930s, was a different subspecies called ''Canis lupus deitanus''. It was even smaller and more reddish in color, without dark spots. Both subspecies were nominated by the Spanish-born zoologist [[\u00c1ngel Cabrera (naturalist)|\u00c1ngel Cabrera]] in 1907.\n\nThe Iberian wolf's skull [[morphometrics]], [[mtDNA]], and [[microsatellite]]s differ from other European wolves.<ref name=ramirez2006/> In 2016, a study of mitochondrial [[DNA sequences]] of both modern and ancient wolves indicated that in Europe, the two most genetically distinct haplotypes form the [[Italian wolf]], and separately, the Iberian wolf.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\nThe [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]/[[Genbank]] lists the Iberian wolf under ''Canis lupus signatus''.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Canis Lupus Signatus (1).JPG|thumb|left|upright|White stripes on the snouts and black marks on the front legs are distinguishing markings of the subspecies]]\n[[File:Iberian Wolf.jpg|thumb|Alpha male Iberian wolf with blood stains in its snout]]\n[[File:Canis lupus signatus - 01.jpg|thumb|Iberian wolf with summer fur in [[Captivity|semi-captivity]] in the [[Community of Madrid]]]]\n[[File:Iberian Wolf 02.jpg|thumb|Iberian wolf pups stimulating the alpha female to regurgitate]]\n\nCabrera identified two types of wolves living in Spain. In comparison, ''C. l. lupus'' had a pale, undefined stroke on the cheek that contrasts with the white on the throat; ''C. l. signatus'' had a white stroke on the cheek that joins the white throat and with a reddish snout; and ''C. l. deitanus'' was much smaller and with more colouring than the wolves to the north. ''C. l. signatus'' is described as being 140-180&nbsp;cm in head and body length, and 70-80&nbsp;cm height at the shoulders.<ref name=cabrera1907/>\n\nThe Iberian wolf differs from the more common [[Eurasian wolf]] with its slighter frame, white marks on the upper lips, the dark marks on the tail, and a pair of dark marks in its front legs that give it its subspecies name, ''signatus'' (\"marked\"). The subspecies differentiation may have developed at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] [[Ice Age]]s due to the isolation of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] when [[glacier]] barriers grew in the [[Pyrenees]] and eventually reached the [[Gulf of Biscay]] in the west and the [[Mediterranean]] in the east.\n\nMales can weigh 30-50&nbsp;kg, although up to 75 kg have been found.Females have dimensions and weight lower than those of males.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.faunaiberica.org/lobo-iberico |title=Lobo ib\u00e9rico |language=es |website=faunaiberica.org}}</ref>\n\n==Diet==\nThe Iberian wolf lives in small packs. It is considered to be beneficial because it keeps the population of [[wild boar]]s stable, thus allowing some respite to the endangered [[capercaillie]] populations which suffer greatly from boar predation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iberianature.com/material/Wolves_boars_capercaillie.htm |title=Wolves, boars and capercaillie |website=IberiaNature |date=Dec 2004 |access-date=2012-12-31}}</ref> It also eats [[rabbit]]s, [[Roe Deer|roe deer]], [[Red Deer|red deer]], [[Spanish Ibex|ibexes]] and even small [[carnivore]]s and [[fish]].\n\n==Distribution and conservation==\nWolf populations strongly declined across Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries largely due to human persecution, and by the end of the [[Second World War]] they had been eradicated from all of [[Central Europe]] and almost all of [[Nordic countries|Northern Europe]]. Their population decline continued until the 1960s, with isolated populations surviving in [[Italy]], Spain, Portugal, [[Greece]], and [[Finland]]. Wolf populations have commenced recovering naturally since then.<ref name=randi2007/>\n\n[[File:Lobo ib\u00e9rico.jpg|thumb|left|Iberian wolf in [[Tudela de Duero]], Spain]]\n\nThe Iberian wolf consists of over 2,000 individuals in over 350 packs distributed across 140,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. \nTheir densities in some regions are among the highest in Europe, with up to 7 wolves/100\u2009km<sup>2</sup>. In 2018, a study identified that this wolf could be categorised into 11 genetic groups. Four groups were identified in the Portuguese regions of [[Alto Minho]], western [[Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes (region)|Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes]], eastern Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes, and one group located south of the [[Douro river]]. Seven groups were identified in the Spanish regions of western [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], eastern Galicia, western [[Asturias]], central Asturias, easten Asturias, south-eastern Asturias, and [[Castilla y Le\u00f3n]].<ref name=silva2018/>\n\nIn Portugal, the populations are small due to the destruction of habitat, loss of wild ungulates and the persecution by humans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naturlink.pt/canais/Artigo.asp?iArtigo=2153&iLingua=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504012545/http://www.naturlink.pt/canais/Artigo.asp?iArtigo=2153&iLingua=1 |archive-date=2008-05-04 |title=Ficha do Lobo |language=pt |website=Naturlink}}</ref>\n\nSome Spanish naturalists and conservationists such as [[F\u00e9lix Rodr\u00edguez de la Fuente]] called for the end of the hunting and the protection of the animal. Today, the hunting of wolves is banned in Portugal, but allowed in some parts of Spain. The 2003 census estimated the total Iberian population to be 2,000 wolves.<ref name=ques131112/> Wolves have been reported as returning to [[Navarre]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and to the provinces of [[Extremadura]], [[Madrid]], and [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]]. A male wolf was found recently in [[Catalonia]], where the last native wolf was killed in 1929. However, this animal was not a member of the Iberian subspecies, but an [[Italian wolf]] (''C. l. italicus'') migrating from [[France]]. As of 2013, an estimated 300 individuals remain in Portugal.<ref name=ptj131108/>\n\nIn October 2013, Ecologists in Action called for an urgent review of the Iberian wolf census, which may overestimate their numbers.<ref name=TI131003/> Later that month, wolf association Lobo Marley sent 198,000 signatures calling for the animal's protection to the [[European Parliament Committee on Petitions]].<ref name=EFE131014/> Over a few weeks in September and October 2013, about 30 puppies and young wolves were killed by hunters in Asturias, Le\u00f3n, and Cantabria.<ref name=ques131112/>\n\nAlthough hunting is banned in Portugal, about 45% of wolf deaths are due to human activities, including illegal hunting.<ref name=ptj131108/> Calling the rate unsustainable, 10 organisations signed a statement requesting stronger protection.<ref name=ptj131108/>\n\n===Southern population===\n[[Sierra Morena]] is a system of rugged mountain ranges in the south of the Iberian Peninsula where a very small wolf population has lived in isolation for half a century. A breeding pair of wolves was last sighted in 2013, however an extensive survey in 2016 could not find a breeding population. The DNA of a road-killed wolf from 2003 indicated high levels of inbreeding and 30% of the [[genome]] being that of dog. It is thought that as the population of these wolves declined, the inability to find a mate led to inbreeding and hybridization with dogs. The wolves in this region may now be extinct.<ref name=gomez2018/>\n\n[[File:Canis lupus footprints.jpg|thumb|Iberian wolf footprints in the snow]]\n\n==2009 controversy==\n\nIn 2009, a picture taken by a Spanish photographer of an Iberian wolf leaping over a [[cattle-pen]] in [[Avila, Spain|\u00c1vila]] won the prestigious [[Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year|Wildlife Photograph of the Year]] award.
