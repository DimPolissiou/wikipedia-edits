It is unclear exactly how Martin bowled and the term \"spin\" could be used to refer to any movement of the ball off the pitch during this era. In his [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Cricketer of the Year]] citation ''Wisden'' wrote that \"when the ground helps him he breaks back in a way that baffles the strongest batsmen\"<ref name=wis92 /> and it is possible that he bowled cutters as well as more orthodox finger spin. Carlaw suggest that he may have been a bowler similar to [[Derek Underwood]] who played for Kent in the 20th century and spun the ball at a medium pace.<ref name=kht /> \n\nAlthough Martin appears to have lost some of the deviation he used after 1891, he retained his accuracy and ability to bowl a good length.<ref name=wis22 /> ''Wisden'' had noted that \"the extreme accuracy of his length makes him difficult to hit on even the best of wickets\".<ref name=wis92 />\n\nIn total he took 1,317 first-class wickets in his career, 947 of them taken for Kent. This places him ninth on the list of Kent's all-time wicket-takers, with only [[Colin Blythe]] and [[Tich Freeman]] taking more wickets at a lower [[bowling average]].<ref name=kht /><ref name=18annual167 /> He took 10 wickets in a match 23 times, 15 for Kent, and five wickets in an innings 95 times, 64 times for his county,<ref name=ci /><ref name=18annual167 /> whilst his match bowling figures on Test debut remain the best match figures for an England bowler on debut.<ref name=co />\n\nAs a batsman Martin was generally rated quite poorly. His ''Wisden'' obituary says that he \"was never much of a batsman\",<ref name=wis22 /> although he was a \"prolific scorer in club cricket\", a feature of his play that does not seem to have been taken seriously at county level.<ref name=kht /> His highest score of 90 runs was made at [[Bat and Ball Ground|Gravesend]] in 1897<ref name=milton113 /> and was one of eight half-centuries he made during his career.<ref name=ci />\n\n==Personal life==\nMartin was nicknamed \"Nutty\".

It is unclear exactly how Martin bowled and the term \"spin\" could be used to refer to any movement of the ball off the pitch during this era. In his [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Cricketer of the Year]] citation ''Wisden'' wrote that \"when the ground helps him he breaks back in a way that baffles the strongest batsmen\"<ref name=wis92 /> and it is possible that he bowled cutters as well as more orthodox finger spin.

Producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] can be heard at the end of the track, walking into the room and saying \"All right, now what?\" The rest of the album was recorded in a matter of five weeks, after which the band decided on the name \"Core\", referring to the [[Apple (symbolism)|apple]] of the [[Bible|Biblical]] story of [[Adam and Eve]].\n\n==Composition==\n''Core'', as a debut album, displayed the band's attempt to revive the album-oriented music approach of the 1970s. Striving to create an intense and emotional sound, vocalist Weiland has said that the main theme of the album is that humanity is confused, with songs like \"[[Sex Type Thing]]\" and \"Naked Sunday\" dealing with social injustice. \"Sex Type Thing\", according to Weiland, deals with abuse of power, \"macho\" behavior, and humanity's attitude toward women, treating them as sex objects. \"Naked Sunday\", according to Weiland, \"is about organized religion. About people who tell others what to do and what to believe. They switch off people's minds and control the masses. It gives me a feeling of isolation, when I think about it. Organized religion does not view everyone as equals.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belowempty.com/articles.php?s=story&id=117|title=Stone Temple Pilots|date= June 1, 1993|work= |publisher= |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref>  Further explaining his lyrical style on ''Core'', Weiland was quoted as saying:\n{{quote|I feel very strongly that all individuals, regardless of age, race, creed or sexual preference, should have the freedom to exercise their rights as human beings to enjoy life, pursue what they want and feel comfortable about who they are. I guess I tend to find the darker sides of life more attractive than the yellows and oranges.

We wanted to create a vibe which would run right through the whole album.\"|source=\u2014Robert DeLeo|align=right|width=33%}}\n\"[[Wicked Garden]]\"'s lyrics deal with the loss of innocence and purity, while \"Sin\" addresses \"violent and ugly\" relationships. The song \"No Memory\", a musical interlude between \"Wicked Garden\" and \"Sin\", was written by guitarist Dean DeLeo.\n\n==Reception==\n{{album ratings |state=plain\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score =  {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=allmusicreview>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/core-mw0000615017|title=Core \u2013 Stone Temple Pilots|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}</ref>\n| rev2 = The Daily Vault\n| rev2score = A<ref name=dailyvault>{{cite web |url= http://dailyvault.com/toc.php5?review=1335 |title=The Daily Vault Music Reviews : Core |first=Alfredo |last=Narvaez |work=dailyvault.com |year=2020 |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev3score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Stone Temple Pilots|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th concise|year=2011|isbn=0-85712-595-8}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev4Score = B<ref name=\"entertainmentweekly\">{{cite journal|last=Frost|first=Deborah|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305836,00.html|title=Core|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|issue=161|date=March 12, 1993|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}</ref>\n| rev5 =''[[Kerrang!]]''\n| rev5Score = 4/5<ref name=\"kerrang\" >{{cite journal|last=Kaye|first=Don|title=Stone Temple Pilots: Core|journal=[[Kerrang!]]|issue=418|date=November 14, 1992|location=London}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev6score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=Stone Temple Pilots: Core|journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|issue=377|date=October 2017|last=Garner|first=George|page=113}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev7Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=rsalbumguide>{{cite book|chapter=Stone Temple Pilots|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9eocwUfoSoC&pg=PA785&lpg=PA785|accessdate=February 9, 2010|last=Appleford|first=Steve|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|edition=4th|location=New York|year=2004|isbn=0-7432-0169-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/785 785\u201386]}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]''\n| rev8Score = 4/5<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://selectmagazinescans.monkeon.co.uk/showpage.php?file=wp-content/uploads/2014/09/albums3.jpg|title=Stone Temple Pilots: Core (East/West)|journal=[[Select (magazine)|Select]]|issue=31|date=January 1993|accessdate=September 6, 2017|last=Clarke|first=Jeremy|page=76}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev9Score = B\u2212<ref name=\"Christgau\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/ts93-93.php|title=Turkey Shoot|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|date=November 23, 1993|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nDon Kaye of ''[[Kerrang!]]'' praised the band's \"confidence and identity\", unusual in debut albums.<ref name=\"kerrang\" /> However, the album still received mixed reviews overall.

Producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] can be heard at the end of the track, walking into the room and saying \"All right, now what?\" The rest of the album was recorded in a matter of five weeks, after which the band decided on the name \"Core\", referring to the [[Apple (symbolism)|apple]] of the [[Bible|Biblical]] story of [[Adam and Eve]].\n\n==Composition==\n''Core'', as a debut album, displayed the band's attempt to revive the album-oriented music approach of the 1970s. Striving to create an intense and emotional sound, vocalist Weiland has said that the main theme of the album is that humanity is confused, with songs like \"[[Sex Type Thing]]\" and \"Naked Sunday\" dealing with social injustice. \"Sex Type Thing\", according to Weiland, deals with abuse of power, \"macho\" behavior, and humanity's attitude toward women, treating them as sex objects. \"Naked Sunday\", according to Weiland, \"is about organized religion. About people who tell others what to do and what to believe. They switch off people's minds and control the masses. It gives me a feeling of isolation, when I think about it. Organized religion does not view everyone as equals.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belowempty.com/articles.php?s=story&id=117|title=Stone Temple Pilots|date= June 1, 1993|work= |publisher= |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref>  Further explaining his lyrical style on ''Core'', Weiland was quoted as saying:\n{{quote|I feel very strongly that all individuals, regardless of age, race, creed or sexual preference, should have the freedom to exercise their rights as human beings to enjoy life, pursue what they want and feel comfortable about who they are. I guess I tend to find the darker sides of life more attractive than the yellows and oranges.

We wanted to create a vibe which would run right through the whole album.\"|source=\u2014Robert DeLeo|align=right|width=33%}}\n\"[[Wicked Garden]]\"'s lyrics deal with the loss of innocence and purity, while \"Sin\" addresses \"violent and ugly\" relationships.

The album, building off the foundations laid by the band's debut album ''[[Core (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Core]]'',  was a huge success for the band, debuting at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and remaining there for three weeks, eventually selling over six million copies. It spawned a number of successful singles \u2014 \"[[Vasoline]]\" and \"[[Interstate Love Song]]\" both topped the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart and hit number 2 on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, while \"[[Big Empty]]\" also cracked the top ten on both charts.  Lesser known album cuts \"[[Pretty Penny]]\" and \"[[Unglued (song)|Unglued]]\" were also released as promotional radio singles.\n\n==Background and musical style==\n[[File:Stone Temple Pilots concert ticket - 1994 - Stierch.jpg|left|thumbnail|''Purple'' tour concert ticket from 1994]]In the spring of 1994, Stone Temple Pilots returned to the studio to work on their next album and completed it in less than a month. The album's first single, \"Big Empty\", made its debut at STP's ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' [[Acoustic music|acoustic performance]] in 1993. The song would later appear on the [[The Crow (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the 1994 [[Brandon Lee]] film ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'', which reached number one on the Billboard charts. A couple of weeks later, ''Purple'' also reached the top of the charts, making two for the band in [[1994 in music|1994]].\n\nThe lyric \"She said she'd be my woman, she said she'd be my man\" from \"Lounge Fly\" also appears in the song \"Spanish Flies\" on the ''Mighty Joe Young Demo''. [[Paul Leary]] of the [[Butthole Surfers]] is credited with playing the ending guitar solo on the song.\n\nWhile ''Purple'' features elements of [[grunge]] like its predecessor, ''[[Core (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Core]]'', the album displays the band developing a sound influenced by other genres, such as the [[psychedelic rock]] evident in \"Lounge Fly\" and \"Silvergun Superman\", the [[country music|country]] vibes of \"Interstate Love Song\" and [[blues rock]] elements of \"Big Empty\". [[Allmusic]]'s [[Stephen Erlewine]] wrote that \"''Purple'' is a quantum leap over [''Core''], showcasing a band hitting their stride.\"  Erlewine also described \"Interstate Love Song\" as a \"concise epic as alluring as the open highway\" and \"Big Empty\" as \"a perfect encapsulation of mainstream alienation.\"<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/purple-mw0000116853 Purple - Stone Temple Pilots : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Artwork==\nThe cover for the album features an animated photo of a child riding on a [[Qilin]] accompanied by a quintet of fairies above the creature and the child, taking place on a cloudy background. The album title is written as a [[Chinese characters|Chinese character]], z\u01d0 (\u7d2b), on the cover, and nowhere else on the packaging (with exception of the UK and European limited edition vinyl release).

The album, building off the foundations laid by the band's debut album ''[[Core (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Core]]'',  was a huge success for the band, debuting at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and remaining there for three weeks, eventually selling over six million copies. It spawned a number of successful singles \u2014 \"[[Vasoline]]\" and \"[[Interstate Love Song]]\" both topped the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart and hit number 2 on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, while \"[[Big Empty]]\" also cracked the top ten on both charts.  Lesser known album cuts \"[[Pretty Penny]]\" and \"[[Unglued (song)|Unglued]]\" were also released as promotional radio singles.\n\n==Background and musical style==\n[[File:Stone Temple Pilots concert ticket - 1994 - Stierch.jpg|left|thumbnail|''Purple'' tour concert ticket from 1994]]In the spring of 1994, Stone Temple Pilots returned to the studio to work on their next album and completed it in less than a month. The album's first single, \"Big Empty\", made its debut at STP's ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' [[Acoustic music|acoustic performance]] in 1993. The song would later appear on the [[The Crow (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the 1994 [[Brandon Lee]] film ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'', which reached number one on the Billboard charts. A couple of weeks later, ''Purple'' also reached the top of the charts, making two for the band in [[1994 in music|1994]].\n\nThe lyric \"She said she'd be my woman, she said she'd be my man\" from \"Lounge Fly\" also appears in the song \"Spanish Flies\" on the ''Mighty Joe Young Demo''. [[Paul Leary]] of the [[Butthole Surfers]] is credited with playing the ending guitar solo on the song.\n\nWhile ''Purple'' features elements of [[grunge]] like its predecessor, ''[[Core (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Core]]'', the album displays the band developing a sound influenced by other genres, such as the [[psychedelic rock]] evident in \"Lounge Fly\" and \"Silvergun Superman\", the [[country music|country]] vibes of \"Interstate Love Song\" and [[blues rock]] elements of \"Big Empty\". [[Allmusic]]'s [[Stephen Erlewine]] wrote that \"''Purple'' is a quantum leap over [''Core''], showcasing a band hitting their stride.\"  Erlewine also described \"Interstate Love Song\" as a \"concise epic as alluring as the open highway\" and \"Big Empty\" as \"a perfect encapsulation of mainstream alienation.\"<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/purple-mw0000116853 Purple - Stone Temple Pilots : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Artwork==\nThe cover for the album features an animated photo of a child riding on a [[Qilin]] accompanied by a quintet of fairies above the creature and the child, taking place on a cloudy background. The album title is written as a [[Chinese characters|Chinese character]], z\u01d0 (\u7d2b), on the cover, and nowhere else on the packaging (with exception of the UK and European limited edition vinyl release).

Hosted at [[Foxboro Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], on October 20, 1996, it was contested by [[D.C. United]] and the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] to decide the champion of the [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996 season]].\n\nBoth finalists finished in the top two spots of their respective conferences, with D.C. placing second in the East and Los Angeles atop the West. The two teams also had identical [[Winning percentage|win\u2013loss]] records in the first two rounds of the playoffs, losing the opening match of the Conference Semifinals and winning the remaining four matches of both rounds. The final match was played in heavy rain due to the proximity of [[Hurricane Lili (1996)|Hurricane Lili]], which also inundated the field. The MLS Cup had an attendance of 34,643 spectators, falling short of the 42,000 people who paid for tickets, and included a large contingent of traveling D.C. supporters.\n\nThe match ended in a 3\u20132 victory for D.C. United, with a [[golden goal]] scored by [[Eddie Pope]] in overtime that followed a second-half comeback for the team. Los Angeles had taken a 2\u20130 lead in the 56th minute on goals by [[Eduardo Hurtado]] and [[Chris Armas]], but conceded two goals to D.C. in the second half to force overtime. [[Marco Etcheverry]] assisted both goals, which began as [[free kick]]s that were headed into the goal by substitutes [[Tony Sanneh]] and [[Shawn Medved]]. Etcheverry went on to take the [[corner kick]] that led to Pope's goal and was named the [[Player of the match|man of the match]]. The finalists also earned a berth in the [[1997 CONCACAF Champions' Cup]] and met in the semifinals, which ended in a victory for the Galaxy.\n\n==Venue==\n[[File:Foxborostade crop 1.png|thumb|right|Aerial view of [[Foxboro Stadium]], the host venue of MLS Cup 1996|alt=Aerial view of Foxboro Stadium with a soccer field surrounded on two sides by three sets of yellow and blue stands, and on two sides by smaller stands.]]\n\n[[Foxboro Stadium]] in the [[Boston]] suburb of [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], was announced as the venue of the inaugural MLS Cup during a league press conference on August 29, 1996.
