It is unclear which of the two spacecraft Borisenko will fly on as no cosmonauts have started training on either vehicle yet, and it has been stated by [[Pavel Vlasov]] (head of the [[Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center]]) that if the two vehicles are further delayed it would be logical to revert Borisenko to a Soyuz flight.<ref>https://ria.ru/20200306/1568224012.html</ref> If Borisenko is the first Russian to fly on either Crew Dragon or Starliner, he will be the first Russian cosmonaut to launch on a spacecraft other than the Soyuz since [[Nikolai Budarin]], who launched on the Space Shuttle on [[STS-113]] in 2002.\n\n==References==\n{{Include-NASA}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Andrei Borisenko}}\n*[http://www.astronaut.ru/index/in_pers/14_007.htm Astronaut.ru]\n\n<center>{{s-start}}{{s-bef|before=[[Dmitri Kondratyev]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Expedition 28|ISS Expedition Commander]]|years=23 May to 16 September 2011}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Michael E.

After attending the traditional greeting ceremony at the airport in [[Karaganda]], Kazakhstan, Borisenko boarded a plane to return to the training base in Star City, Russia.\n\n===Expedition 49/50===\n[[File:ISS-50 Andrei Borisenko with cookies at Christmas Eve.jpg|thumb|right| Borisenko pictured on Christmas Eve 2016]]\n\nBorisenko launched for a second time on 19 October 2016 aboard [[Soyuz MS-02]] as Flight Engineer<ref>http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz-ms-02.html</ref>, launch was originally scheduled for 23 September although was delayed due to technical issues with the spacecraft<ref>https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/09/17/russians-delay-next-crew-launch-to-space-station/</ref>.\n\n[[File:Soyuz MS-02 crew in front of their spacecraft.jpg|thumb|left| Borisenko (right), pictured with [[Soyuz MS-02]] crew members [[Shane Kimbrough]] (left), and commander [[Sergey Nikolayevich Ryzhikov|Sergey Ryzhikov]] (centre)]]\n\nBorisenko and his two crew mates, Roscosmos cosmonaut [[Sergey Ryzhikov]] and NASA astronaut [[Shane Kimbrough]] rendezvoused and docked to the ISS on the 21st of October following a two day rendezvous, and officially joined the [[Expedition 49]] alongside Russian commander [[Anatoli Ivanishin]] and flight engineers [[Takuya Onishi]] of [[JAXA]] and [[Kathleen Rubins]] of NASA. Due to month long launch delay Soyuz MS-02 faced, the hand over period was short, Expedition 49 ended on 30 October 2016 when Ivanishin, Onishi and Rubins returned to Earth aboard [[Soyuz MS-01]], leaving the MS-02 trio on board the ISS as [[Expedition 50]] with Kimbrough taking command<ref>http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz-ms-01.html</ref>.\n\n[[File:Expedition 50 Soyuz MS-02 Landing (NHQ201704100005).jpg|right|thumb|Borisenko following the landing of Soyuz MS-02.]]\n\nThe rest of the Expedition 50 crew joined Borisenko and his two crew mates on 19 November 2016 when [[Soyuz MS-03]], carrying Russian cosmonaut [[Oleg Novitsky]], [[ESA|French]] astronaut [[Thomas Pesquet]], and NASA astronaut [[Peggy Whitson]] docked to the station<ref>http://spaceflight101.com/soyuz-ms-03/soyuz-ms-03-docking/</ref>. During the Expedition the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] of the ISS was supposed to welcome the [[Progress MS-04]] uncrewed resupply spacecraft, although the spacecraft failed to reach the ISS due to an issue with the [[Soyuz-U]] launch vehicle's third stage which shutdown sooner than intended<ref>https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/12/roscosmos-progress-ms-0465p-to-station/</ref>. Progress flights quickly resumed during Expedition 50, with the launch of [[Progress MS-05]] in February 2017<ref>http://www.russianspaceweb.com/progress-ms-05.html</ref>.\n\nBorisenko continued to work as a flight engineer with the Expedition 50 crew until 10 April 2017, when he, Ryzhikov and Kimbrough un-docked from the ISS, officially ending Expedition 50 and starting [[Expedition 51]]. The trio safely landed on the [[Kazakh Steppe]] less than five hours later, wrapping up a 173 day spaceflight and bringing Borisenko's total time in space to 337 days<ref>https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/04/soyuz-ms-02-back-earth/</ref>.\n\n===Commercial Crew Program===\n\nBorisenko is currently scheduled to be one of the first Russian cosmonauts to fly on board an American [[Commercial Crew Development|Commercial Crew Vehicle]], as he is the only confirmed member of a cadre of Russian cosmonauts assigned to fly onboard either [[SpaceX|SpaceX's]] [[Crew Dragon]] or [[Boeing|Boeing's]] [[Starliner (spacecraft)|Starliner]] spacecraft once they have completed crewed test flights and proved their safety. It is unclear which of the two spacecraft Borisenko will fly on as no cosmonauts have started training on either vehicle yet, and it has been stated by [[Pavel Vlasov]] (head of the [[Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center]]) that if the two vehicles are further delayed it would be logical to revert Borisenko to a Soyuz flight.<ref>https://ria.ru/20200306/1568224012.html</ref> If Borisenko is the first Russian to fly on either Crew Dragon or Starliner, he will be the first Russian cosmonaut to launch on a spacecraft other than the Soyuz since [[Nikolai Budarin]], who launched on the Space Shuttle on [[STS-113]] in 2002.\n\n==References==\n{{Include-NASA}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Andrei Borisenko}}\n*[http://www.astronaut.ru/index/in_pers/14_007.htm Astronaut.ru]\n\n<center>{{s-start}}{{s-bef|before=[[Dmitri Kondratyev]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Expedition 28|ISS Expedition Commander]]|years=23 May to 16 September 2011}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Michael E.

Sabinus'' or \"Aulus Sabinus, a celebrated Roman knight (''[[equestrian order|eques]]'') and poet.\" Ovid refers twice in his poetry to [[Sabinus (Ovid)|his friend Sabinus]]. He says that Sabinus wrote answers to six of the ''Hero\u00efdes'', which he enumerates<ref>Ovid, ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' 2.18.27\u201434.</ref> as [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] to [[Penelope]], in response to ''Hero\u00efdes'' 1; [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] to [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] (''H.'' 4); [[Aeneas]] to [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] (''H.'' 7); [[Demophon (King of Athens)|Demophoon]] to [[Phyllis (mythology)|Phyllis]] (''H.'' 2); [[Jason]] to [[Hypsipyle]] (''H.'' 6); and [[Phaon]] to [[Sappho]] (''H.'' 15). In his last [[Epistulae ex Ponto|letter from exile]],<ref>Ovid, ''[[Ex Ponto]]'' 4.16.13\u201316.</ref> Ovid refers again to Sabinus and mentions the letter from Ulysses.\n\nSabino took two of his imitations from this list, the letters from Ulysses and Demophoon, and added a third from [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] to [[Oenone]], corresponding to ''Hero\u00efdes'' 5. The three epistles continued to be published in editions of the ''Hero\u00efdes'' as the authentic work of Ovid's friend until the era of post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] literary studies, and can be found in some collections into the 1800s, long after Sabino had been revealed as the author.\n\nThomas Salusbury<ref>The identity of this Thomas Salusbury is unclear; there is more than one English writer by this name during the relevant time period.</ref> translated Sabino's three imitations of the ''Hero\u00efdes'' into English, which can be found in a 1795 anthology of Ovid's verse epistles.

He had even identified himself as the author of ''Heroides'' imitations in his introduction to the ''Paradoxa''.<ref>''Igitur cum per a\u00ebris intemperiem ab urbe Roma in Sabinos Cures me recipissem Heroidibusque Nasonis poetae inclyti heroas respondentes facerem'', as quoted by Remigio Sabbadini, ''Le scoperte dei codici latini e greci ne' secoli XIV e XV'' (Florence, 1905), pp. 176\u2013177 [https://books.google.com/books?id=llFFAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=Angelo%20Sabino&f=false online], noting that \"in the Middle Ages, the production of pseudovidiana was rampant.\" The history of scholarship on the question of Sabino's authorship of the three epistles is reviewed by the 19th-century literary historian Atto Vannucci, ''Studi storici e morali sulla letteratura latina'' (Rome, 1871, 3rd ed.), pp. 413\u2013414, note 3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_VBAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA413&dq=%22Alle+Epistole+delle+donne+rispose+in+versi+Aulo+Sabino%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0#v=onepage&q=%22Alle%20Epistole%20delle%20donne%20rispose%20in%20versi%20Aulo%20Sabino%22&f=false online.]</ref> Dangling another clue, Sabino departed from Ovid's original list of poems by Sabinus and substituted a letter from the Trojan prince Paris.\n\nThe assumption of Latin or Greek identities by Renaissance men of letters was common, and adopting an Ovidian persona in writing [[New Latin|neo-Latin]] poetry had been a literary pose since the [[Medieval literature|Middle Ages]].<!--though reading the article on courtly love, you'd never know it--> As Peter E. Knox notes in ''A Companion to Ovid'':\n\n{{cquote|By observing classical norms in meter and diction and drawing on literary and mythographic resources, scholars such as Sabinus employed imitation as a means of working toward interpretation. Imposture was almost certainly not Sabinus' goal: he refers to his responses to Ovid's ''Heroides'' in the dedicatory letter of his ''Paradoxa'' dated 1467. Rather like similarly inspired efforts to flesh out and make sense of the narratives of classical literature \u2014 [[Maffeo Vegio]]'s thirteenth book of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' \u2026 comes to mind \u2014 Sabinus takes up the implicit challenge of re-imagining Ovid. \u2026 Sabinus sought to interpret Ovid by reconfiguring his work, a form of reception that Ovid's works still inspire in contemporary artists and writers.<ref>Peter E.

Sabinus'' or \"Aulus Sabinus, a celebrated Roman knight (''[[equestrian order|eques]]'') and poet.\" Ovid refers twice in his poetry to [[Sabinus (Ovid)|his friend Sabinus]]. He says that Sabinus wrote answers to six of the ''Hero\u00efdes'', which he enumerates<ref>Ovid, ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' 2.18.27\u201434.</ref> as [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] to [[Penelope]], in response to ''Hero\u00efdes'' 1; [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] to [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] (''H.'' 4); [[Aeneas]] to [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] (''H.'' 7); [[Demophon (King of Athens)|Demophoon]] to [[Phyllis (mythology)|Phyllis]] (''H.'' 2); [[Jason]] to [[Hypsipyle]] (''H.'' 6); and [[Phaon]] to [[Sappho]] (''H.'' 15). In his last [[Epistulae ex Ponto|letter from exile]],<ref>Ovid, ''[[Ex Ponto]]'' 4.16.13\u201316.</ref> Ovid refers again to Sabinus and mentions the letter from Ulysses.\n\nSabino took two of his imitations from this list, the letters from Ulysses and Demophoon, and added a third from [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] to [[Oenone]], corresponding to ''Hero\u00efdes'' 5. The three epistles continued to be published in editions of the ''Hero\u00efdes'' as the authentic work of Ovid's friend until the era of post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] literary studies, and can be found in some collections into the 1800s, long after Sabino had been revealed as the author.\n\nThomas Salusbury<ref>The identity of this Thomas Salusbury is unclear; there is more than one English writer by this name during the relevant time period.</ref> translated Sabino's three imitations of the ''Hero\u00efdes'' into English, which can be found in a 1795 anthology of Ovid's verse epistles.

He had even identified himself as the author of ''Heroides'' imitations in his introduction to the ''Paradoxa''.<ref>''Igitur cum per a\u00ebris intemperiem ab urbe Roma in Sabinos Cures me recipissem Heroidibusque Nasonis poetae inclyti heroas respondentes facerem'', as quoted by Remigio Sabbadini, ''Le scoperte dei codici latini e greci ne' secoli XIV e XV'' (Florence, 1905), pp. 176\u2013177 [https://books.google.com/books?id=llFFAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=Angelo%20Sabino&f=false online], noting that \"in the Middle Ages, the production of pseudovidiana was rampant.\" The history of scholarship on the question of Sabino's authorship of the three epistles is reviewed by the 19th-century literary historian Atto Vannucci, ''Studi storici e morali sulla letteratura latina'' (Rome, 1871, 3rd ed.), pp. 413\u2013414, note 3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_VBAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA413&dq=%22Alle+Epistole+delle+donne+rispose+in+versi+Aulo+Sabino%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0#v=onepage&q=%22Alle%20Epistole%20delle%20donne%20rispose%20in%20versi%20Aulo%20Sabino%22&f=false online.]</ref> Dangling another clue, Sabino departed from Ovid's original list of poems by Sabinus and substituted a letter from the Trojan prince Paris.\n\nThe assumption of Latin or Greek identities by Renaissance men of letters was common, and adopting an Ovidian persona in writing [[New Latin|neo-Latin]] poetry had been a literary pose since the [[Medieval literature|Middle Ages]].<!--though reading the article on courtly love, you'd never know it--> As Peter E. Knox notes in ''A Companion to Ovid'':\n\n{{cquote|By observing classical norms in meter and diction and drawing on literary and mythographic resources, scholars such as Sabinus employed imitation as a means of working toward interpretation. Imposture was almost certainly not Sabinus' goal: he refers to his responses to Ovid's ''Heroides'' in the dedicatory letter of his ''Paradoxa'' dated 1467. Rather like similarly inspired efforts to flesh out and make sense of the narratives of classical literature \u2014 [[Maffeo Vegio]]'s thirteenth book of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' \u2026 comes to mind \u2014 Sabinus takes up the implicit challenge of re-imagining Ovid. \u2026 Sabinus sought to interpret Ovid by reconfiguring his work, a form of reception that Ovid's works still inspire in contemporary artists and writers.<ref>Peter E.

The novel is set in the early part of the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and explores the possible consequences had the [[Tudor Dynasty|Tudors]] been overthrown by a rightful descendant of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].<ref name=\"Daniell185\">{{Cite book|last=Daniell|first=David|title=The Interpreter's House|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd|year=1975|isbn=0 17 146051 0|page=185}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe action of the novel takes place in the country west of [[Oxford]] during the 1536 [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], an uprising against Henry VIII. Peter Pentecost, a young monastic scholar, is informed by shadowy figures who are plotting to depose the king that he is the legitimate son of the [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] and that, as the last of the [[Bohun family|Bohun line]], he has a claim to the English throne.\n\nAlthough his true identity must for now remain secret, Peter soon finds himself being prepared for his intended kingly role and being tutored in the noble pursuits of [[swordsmanship]] and [[archery]]. He meets a noblewoman, Sabine Beauforest.\n\nTo hide from the king\u2019s men, Peter takes to the greenwood where he is aided by Solomon Darking and his vagabond comrades. They introduce him to the lore of the countryside, and reveal the existence of an entirely self-contained outlaw society, invisible to the agents of the state, with its own system of communication and intelligence gathering.

The novel is set in the early part of the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and explores the possible consequences had the [[Tudor Dynasty|Tudors]] been overthrown by a rightful descendant of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].<ref name=\"Daniell185\">{{Cite book|last=Daniell|first=David|title=The Interpreter's House|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd|year=1975|isbn=0 17 146051 0|page=185}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe action of the novel takes place in the country west of [[Oxford]] during the 1536 [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], an uprising against Henry VIII. Peter Pentecost, a young monastic scholar, is informed by shadowy figures who are plotting to depose the king that he is the legitimate son of the [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] and that, as the last of the [[Bohun family|Bohun line]], he has a claim to the English throne.\n\nAlthough his true identity must for now remain secret, Peter soon finds himself being prepared for his intended kingly role and being tutored in the noble pursuits of [[swordsmanship]] and [[archery]]. He meets a noblewoman, Sabine Beauforest.\n\nTo hide from the king\u2019s men, Peter takes to the greenwood where he is aided by Solomon Darking and his vagabond comrades. They introduce him to the lore of the countryside, and reveal the existence of an entirely self-contained outlaw society, invisible to the agents of the state, with its own system of communication and intelligence gathering. He discovers that \u2018under the blanket of the dark all men are alike and all are nameless'.\n\nAs the novel progresses, Peter realises he is having increasing doubts about of the venture he is being asked to undertake, and the motives of those behind it: \u201cThey claimed to stand for the elder England and its rights, and [[Catholic Church|the old Church]], but at their heart they stood only for themselves.\u201d After an encounter with the King himself, Peter asks himself whether there \u201cmight not there be a world of light under the blanket of the dark?\u201d, and he decides that he does not wish to pursue a life of power.

It aimed at determining the territories of the states in the [[Balkan Peninsula]] after the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]] and came to an end with the signing of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], which replaced the preliminary [[Treaty of San Stefano]], which had been signed three months earlier between [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n[[File:Balkans 1878.png|thumb|Borders in the Balkan peninsula after the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]]]]\n\nGerman Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], who led the Congress, undertook to stabilise the Balkans, recognise the reduced power of the Ottoman Empire and balance the distinct interests of Britain, Russia and [[Austria-Hungary]]. At the same time, he tried to diminish Russian gains in the region and to prevent the rise of a [[Greater Bulgaria]]. As a result, Ottoman lands in Europe declined sharply, Bulgaria was established as an independent principality within the Ottoman Empire, [[Eastern Rumelia]] was restored to the Ottoman Empire under a special administration and the [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] was returned outright to the Ottoman Empire, which promised reform.\n\n[[Romania]] achieved full independence; it was forced to turn over part of [[Bessarabia]] to Russia but gained [[Northern Dobruja]].

National Board for Historical Service. Government Printing Office, Washington, 1918.]</ref> Austria-Hungary also took over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and Britain took over [[Cyprus]].\n\nThe results were first hailed as a great achievement in peacemaking and stabilisation. However, most of the participants were not fully satisfied, and grievances on the results festered until they exploded in the [[First Balkan War|First]] and the [[Second Balkan War|Second Balkan Wars]] in 1912\u20131913 and eventually the [[First World War]] in 1914. Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece all received gains that were far less than they thought that they deserved.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, then called the \"[[sick man of Europe]]\", was humiliated and significantly weakened, which made it more liable to domestic unrest and vulnerable to attack.\n\nAlthough Russia had been victorious in the war that occasioned the conference, it was humiliated there and resented its treatment. Austria-Hungary gained a great deal of territory, which angered the South Slavs and led to decades of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nBismarck became the target of hatred by Russian nationalists and Pan-Slavists, and he later found that he had tied Germany too closely to Austria-Hungary in the Balkans.<ref>Jerome L. Blum, et al. ''The European World: A History'' (1970) p. 841</ref>\n\nIn the long run, tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary intensified, as did the nationality question in the Balkans. The Congress was aimed at revising the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] and at keeping [[Constantinople]] within Ottoman hands. It effectively disavowed Russia's victory over the decaying Ottoman Empire during the Russo-Turkish War. The Congress returned territories to the Ottoman Empire that the earlier treaty had given to the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], most notably [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], thus setting up a strong revanchist demand in Bulgaria, which led to the 1912 First Balkan War.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Edward Stanford 1877.jpg|left|thumb|Pro-Greek ethnic map of the [[Balkans]] by Ioannis Gennadius,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEyinJwjWIgC&pg=PA169 |first=I.

Stanford in 1877]]\n\nIn the decades leading up to the congress, Russia and the Balkans had been gripped by [[Pan-Slavism]], a movement to unite all the Balkan Slavs under one rule. That desire, which evolved similarly to the [[Pan-Germanism]] and [[Italian Unification|Pan-Italianism]], which had resulted in two unifications, took different forms in the various Slavic nations. In Imperial Russia, Pan-Slavism meant the creation of a unified Slavic state, under Russian direction, and was essentially a byword for Russian conquest of the Balkan peninsula.<ref>Ragsdale, Hugh, and V. N. Ponomarev. ''Imperial Russian Foreign Policy''.

How and even whether that was to proceed would be the major question to be answered at the Congress of Berlin.\n\n==Great powers in Balkans==\nThe Balkans were a major stage for competition between the European [[great powers]] in the second half of the 19th century. Britain and Russia had interests in the fate of the Balkans. Russia was interested in the region, both ideologically, as a pan-Slavist unifier, and practically, to secure greater control of the Mediterranean. Britain was interested in preventing Russia from accomplishing its goals. Furthermore, the [[Unification of Italy|Unifications of Italy]] and [[Unification of Germany|of Germany]] had stymied the ability of a third European power, Austria-Hungary, to expand its domain to the southwest any further. Germany, as the most powerful continental nation since the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] had little direct interest in the settlement and so was the only power that could mediate the Balkan question credibly.{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=135\u2013137}}\n\nRussia and Austria-Hungary, the two powers that were most invested in the fate of the Balkans, were allied with Germany in the conservative [[League of Three Emperors]], which had been founded to preserve the monarchies of [[Continental Europe]]. The Congress of Berlin was thus mainly a dispute among supposed allies of Bismarck and his German Empire, the arbiter of the discussion, would thus have to choose before the end of the congress which of their allies to support. That decision was to have direct consequences on the future of European geopolitics.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Norton Medlicott|title=Congress of Berlin and After|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU7YAQAAQBAJ|year=1963|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-24317-2|pages=14\u2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=135\u2013137}}\n\nOttoman brutality in the [[Serbian\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Serbian\u2013Ottoman War]] and the violent suppression of the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875\u201377)|Herzegovina Uprising]] fomented political pressure within Russia, which saw itself as the protector of the Serbs, to act against the Ottoman Empire.

The Ottomans recognised Montenegro, Romania and Serbia as independent, and the territories of all three of them were expanded. Russia created a large Principality of Bulgaria as an autonomous vassal of the sultan. That expanded Russia's sphere of influence to encompass the entire Balkans, which alarmed other powers in Europe. Britain, which had threatened war with Russia if it occupied [[Constantinople]],<ref>Ragsdale, Hugh, and V. N. Ponomarev. ''Imperial Russian Foreign Policy''. Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1993, pp. 239\u201340.</ref> and France did not want another power meddling in either the Mediterranean or the Middle East, where both powers were prepared to make large [[Scramble for Africa|colonial gains]]. Austria-Hungary desired Habsburg control over the Balkans, and Germany wanted to prevent its ally from going to war. German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] thus called the Congress of Berlin to discuss the partition of the Ottoman Balkans among the European powers and to preserve the League of Three Emperors in the face of the spread of European [[Liberalism#Spread of liberalism|liberalism]].{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=135\u2013138}}\n\nThe Congress was attended by Britain, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], Russia and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Delegates from [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] attended the sessions that concerned their states, but they were not members.\n\nThe Congress was solicited by Russia's rivals, particularly Austria-Hungary and Britain, and was hosted in 1878 by Bismarck. It proposed and ratified the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]]. The meetings were held at Bismarck's [[Reich Chancellery]], the former [[Radziwill]] Palace, from 13 June to 13 July 1878. The congress revised or eliminated 18 of the 29 articles in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]]. Furthermore, by using as a foundation the Treaties of [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Paris (1856)]] and of [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Washington]] (1871), the treaty rearranged the East.\n\n==Other powers' fear of Russian influence==\n[[File:Ernst-Ravenstein-Balkans-Ethnic-Map-1880.jpg|thumb|left|Ethnic composition map of the [[Balkans]] by the German-English cartographer [[Ernst Georg Ravenstein]] of 1870]]\n\nThe principal mission of the participants at the Congress was to deal a fatal blow to the burgeoning movement of [[pan-Slavism]]. The movement caused serious concern in Berlin and even more so in Vienna, which was afraid that the repressed Slavic nationalities would revolt against the [[Habsburgs]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] and the [[France|French]] governments were nervous about both the diminishing influence of the Ottoman Empire and the cultural expansion of Russia to the south, where both Britain and France were poised to colonise [[Egypt]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. By the Treaty of San Stefano, the Russians, led by Chancellor [[Alexander Gorchakov]], had managed to create in [[Bulgaria]] an autonomous principality, under the nominal rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. That sparked the [[Great Game]], the massive British fear of the growing Russian influence in the [[Middle East]]. The new principality, including a very large portion of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] as well as access to the [[Aegean Sea]], could easily threaten the [[Dardanelle Straits]], which separate the [[Black Sea]] from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The arrangement was not acceptable to the British, who considered the entire Mediterranean to be a British [[sphere of influence]] and saw any Russian attempt to gain access there as a grave threat to British power. On 4 June, before the Congress opened on 13 June, British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli|Lord Beaconsfield]] had already concluded the [[Cyprus Convention]], a secret alliance with the Ottomans against Russia in which Britain was allowed to occupy the strategically-placed island of [[Cyprus]]. The agreement predetermined Beaconsfield's position during the Congress and led him to issue threats to unleash a war against Russia if it did not comply with Ottoman demands. Negotiations between Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] and British Foreign Secretary [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] had already \"ended on 6 June by Britain agreeing to all the Austrian proposals relative to Bosnia-Herzegovina about to come before the congress while Austria would support British demands\".{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=20}}\n\n==Bismarck as host==\n[[File:Bismarck emperors Austria, Germany & Russia as puppets.jpg|thumb|Bismarck manipulates the emperors of Austria, Germany & Russia like a ventriloquist's puppets.]]\n[[File:Bulgaria San Stefano Berlin 1878 TB.png|thumb|Borders of Bulgaria according to the preliminary [[Treaty of San Stefano]] (red stripes) and the superseding [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] (solid red)]]\n\nThe Congress of Berlin is frequently viewed as the culmination of the battle between Chancellors [[Alexander Gorchakov]] of Russia and [[Otto von Bismarck]] of Germany. Both were able to persuade other European leaders that a free and independent [[Bulgaria]] would greatly improve the security risks posed by a disintegrating Ottoman Empire. According to historian [[Erich Eyck]], Bismarck supported Russia's position that \"Turkish rule over a Christian community (Bulgaria) was an anachronism which undoubtedly gave rise to insurrection and bloodshed and should therefore be ended\".<ref name=\"Eyck\">Erich Eyck, ''Bismarck and the German Empire'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 1964), pp. 245\u201346.</ref> He used the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] of 1875 as proof of growing animosity in the region.\n\nBismarck's ultimate goal during the Congress of Berlin was not to upset Germany's status on the international platform. He did not wish to disrupt the [[League of the Three Emperors]] by choosing between Russia and Austria as an ally.<ref name=\"Eyck\"/> To maintain peace in Europe, Bismarck sought to convince other European diplomats that dividing up the [[Balkans]] would foster greater stability. During the process, Russia began to feel cheated despite eventually gaining independence for Bulgaria. Problems in the alliances in Europe before the First World War eere thus noticeable.\n\nOne reason that Bismarck was able to mediate the various tensions at the Congress of Berlin was his diplomatic persona. He sought peace and stability when international affairs did not pertain to Germany directly. Since he viewed the current situation in Europe as favourable for Germany, any conflicts between the major European powers that threatened the status quo was against German interests. Also, at the Congress of Berlin, \"Germany could not look for any advantage from the crisis\" that had occurred in the Balkans in 1875.<ref name=\"Eyck\"/> Therefore, Bismarck claimed impartiality on behalf of Germany at the Congress, which enabled him to preside over the negotiations with a keen eye for foul play.\n\nThough most of Europe went into the Congress expecting a diplomatic show, much like the [[Congress of Vienna]], they were to be sadly disappointed. Bismarck, unhappy to be conducting the Congress in the heat of the summer, had a short temper and a low tolerance for malarky. Thus, any grandstanding was cut short by the testy German chancellor. The ambassadors from the small Balkan territories whose fate was being decided were barely even allowed to attend the diplomatic meetings, which were between mainly the representatives of the great powers.{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nAccording to [[Henry Kissinger]],<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Simon & Schuster\n| isbn = 0-671-51099-1\n| pages = 139\u2013143\n| last = Kissinger\n| first = Henry\n| title = Diplomacy\n| date = 1995-04-04\n}}</ref> the congress saw a shift in Bismarck's [[Realpolitik]]. Until then, as Germany had become too powerful for isolation, his policy was to maintain the League of the Three Emperors. Now that he could no longer rely on Russia's alliance, he began to form relations with as many potential enemies as possible.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Events leading to World War I}}\n\nBowing to Russia's pressure, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro were all declared independent principalities. Russia kept [[Bessarabia|South Bessarabia]], which it had annexed in the Russo-Turkish War, but the Bulgarian state that it had created was first bisected and then divided again into the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, both of which were given nominal autonomy, under the control of the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Oakes, Augustus, and R. B. Mowat. ''The Great European Treaties of the Nineteenth Century''. Clarendon Press, 1918, pp. 332\u201360.</ref> Bulgaria was promised autonomy, and guarantees were made against Turkish interference, but they were largely ignored. Romania received [[Northern Dobruja]]. Montenegro obtained [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], along with the primary Albanian regions of [[Podgorica]], [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] and [[Plav-Gusinje]]. The Ottoman government, or [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], agreed to obey the specifications contained in the Organic Law of 1868 and to guarantee the civil rights of non-Muslim subjects. The region of Bosnia-Herzegovina was handed over to the administration of Austria-Hungary, which also obtained the right to garrison the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], a small border region between Montenegro and Serbia. Bosnia and Herzegovina were put on the fast track to eventual annexation. Russia agreed that [[Macedonia region|Macedonia]], the most important strategic section of the Balkans, was too multinational to be part of Bulgaria and permitted it to remain under the Ottoman Empire. [[Eastern Rumelia]], which had its own large Turkish and Greek minorities, became an autonomous province under a Christian ruler, with its capital at [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]]. The remaining portions of the original \"Greater Bulgaria\" became the new state of Bulgaria.\n\nIn Russia, the Congress of Berlin was considered to be a dismal failure. After finally defeating the Turks despite many past inconclusive Russo-Turkish wars, many Russians had expected \"something colossal\", a redrawing of the Balkan borders in support of Russian territorial ambitions. Instead, the victory resulted in an Austro-Hungarian gain on the Balkan front that was brought about by the rest of the European powers' preference for a powerful Austria-Hungarian Empire, which threatened basically no one, to a powerful Russia, which had been locked in competition with Britain in the so-called [[Great Game]] for most of the century. Gorchakov said, \"I consider the Berlin Treaty the darkest page in my life\". Most Russian people furious over the European repudiation of their political gains, and though there was some thought that it represented only a minor stumble on the road to Russian hegemony in the Balkans, it actually gave Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia over to Austria-Hungary's sphere of influence and essentially removed all Russian influence from the area.<ref>Ragsdale, Hugh, and V. N. Ponomarev. ''Imperial Russian Foreign Policy''. Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1993, pp. 244\u201346.</ref>\n\nThe Serbs were upset with \"Russia... consenting to the cession of Bosnia to Austria\":{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=32}}\n\n<blockquote>[[Jovan Risti\u0107|Risti\u0107]] who was Serbia\u2019s first plenipotentiary at Berlin tells how he asked Jomini, one of the Russian delegates, what consolation remained to the Serbs. Jomini replied that it would have to be the thought that 'the situation was only temporary because within fifteen years at the latest we shall be forced to fight Austria.' 'Vain consolation!' comments Risti\u0107.{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=32}}</blockquote>\n\nItaly was dissatisfied with the results of the Congress, and the tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire were left unresolved. Bosnia-Herzegovina would also prove to be problematic for the Austro-Hungarian Empire in later decades. The [[League of the Three Emperors]], established in 1873, was destroyed since Russia saw lack of German support on the issue of Bulgaria's full independence as a breach of loyalty and the alliance. The border between Greece and Turkey was not resolved. In 1881, after protracted negotiations, a compromise border [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|was accepted]] after a naval demonstration of the great powers had resulted in the cession of [[Thessaly]] and the [[Arta Prefecture]] to Greece.\n\nThus, the Berlin Congress sowed the seeds of further conflicts, including the Balkan Wars and (ultimately) the [[First World War]]. In the 'Salisbury Circular' of 1 April 1878, the British Foreign Secretary, the [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]], clarified the objections of him and the government to the Treaty of San Stefano because of the favorable position in which it left Russia.<ref>Walker, Christopher J. (1980), ''Armenia: The Survival of A Nation'', London: Croom Helm, p. 112</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the British historian [[AJP Taylor]] wrote: \"If the treaty of San Stefano had been maintained, both the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary might have survived to the present day. The British, except for [[Disraeli|Beaconsfield]] in his wilder moments, had expected less and were therefore less disappointed. Salisbury wrote at the end of 1878: We shall set up a rickety sort of Turkish rule again south of the Balkans. But it is a mere respite. There is no vitality left in them.\"<ref>AJP Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1914\u20131918'', [[Oxford University Press]] (1954) p. 253</ref>\n\nThough the Congress of Berlin constituted a harsh blow to [[Pan-Slavism]], it, by no means, solved the question of the area. The Slavs in the Balkans were still mostly under non-Slavic rule, split between the rule of Austria-Hungary and the ailing Ottoman Empire. The Slavic states of the Balkans had learned that banding together since Slavs benefited them less than playing to the desires of a neighboring great power. That damaged the unity of the Balkan Slavs and encouraged competition between the fledgling Slav states.{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\nThe underlying tensions of the region would continue to simmer for thirty years until they again exploded in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u20131913. In 1914, the [[assassination of Franz Ferdinand]] the Austro-Hungarian heir, led to the [[First World War]]. In hindsight, the stated goal of maintaining peace and balance of powers in the Balkans obviously failed since the region would remain a source of conflict between the great powers well into the 20th century.{{sfn|Glenny|2000|p=151}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:A Synvet 1877.jpg|Map of the ethnic composition of the [[Balkans]] in 1877 by A.

The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]] that \"would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence\".{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=19}} \"High [Austro-Hungarian] military authorities desired...

The motion was lost by 179 to 95.

This vigorous and exclusive instinct explains the historical phenomenon of an isolated group, small in numbers yet dominating a country inhabited by a majority of peoples of different races and conflicting aspirations, and playing a role in European affairs out of all proportions to its numerical importance or intellectual culture. This instinct is today awakened and gives warning that it feels the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina to be a menace which, by introducing fresh Slav elements into the Hungarian political organism and providing a wider field and further recruitment of the Croat opposition, would upset the unstable equilibrium in which the Magyar domination is poised.{{sfn|Albertini|1952|pp=33\u201334}}</blockquote>\n\n==Delegates==\n{{div col}}\n[[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] {{flagicon|United Kingdom}}\n* [[Benjamin Disraeli]] Earl of Beaconsfield (Prime Minister)\n* [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] (Foreign Secretary)\n* [[Odo Russell, 1st Baron Ampthill|Baron Ampthill]] (Ambassador to Germany)\n\n[[Russian Empire]] {{flagicon|Russian Empire}}\n* [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]] (Foreign Minister)\n* [[Pyotr Andreyevich Shuvalov|Count Shuvalov]] (Ambassador to Great Britain)\n* [[Pavel Ubri|Baron d'Oubril]] (Ambassador to Germany)\n\n[[German Empire]] {{flagicon|German Empire}}\n* [[Otto von Bismarck]] (Chancellor)\n* [[Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst|Prince Hohenlohe]] (Ambassador to France)\n* [[Bernhard Ernst von B\u00fclow]] (State Secretary for Foreign Affairs)\n\n[[Austria-Hungary]] {{flagicon|Austria-Hungary}}\n* [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy|Count Andr\u00e1ssy]] (Foreign Minister)\n* [[Alajos K\u00e1rolyi|Count K\u00e1rolyi]] (Ambassador to Germany)\n* [[Baron Heinrich Karl von Haymerle]] (Ambassador to Italy)\n\n[[French Third Republic|French Republic]] {{flagicon|France}}\n* [[William Henry Waddington|Monsieur Waddington]] (Foreign Minister)\n* Comte de Saint-Vallier\n* Monsieur Desprey\n\n[[Kingdom of Italy]] {{flagicon|Kingdom of Italy}}\n* [[Lodovico, Count Corti|Count Corti]] (Foreign Minister)\n* Count De Launay\n\n[[Ottoman Empire]] {{flagicon|Ottoman Empire}}\n* [[Alexander Karatheodori Pasha|Karatheodori Pasha]]\n* [[Sadullah Pasha]]\n* [[Mehmed Ali Pasha (marshal)|Mehmed Ali Pasha]]\n* [[Catholicos]] [[Mkrtich Khrimian]] (representing Armenian population)\n\n[[United Principalities|Romania]] {{flagicon|Romania}}\n* [[Ion Br\u0103tianu|Ion C.

As a result, Ottoman lands in Europe declined sharply, Bulgaria was established as an independent principality within the Ottoman Empire, [[Eastern Rumelia]] was restored to the Ottoman Empire under a special administration and the [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] was returned outright to the Ottoman Empire, which promised reform.\n\n[[Romania]] achieved full independence; it was forced to turn over part of [[Bessarabia]] to Russia but gained [[Northern Dobruja]].

Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece all received gains that were far less than they thought that they deserved.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, then called the \"[[sick man of Europe]]\", was humiliated and significantly weakened, which made it more liable to domestic unrest and vulnerable to attack.\n\nAlthough Russia had been victorious in the war that occasioned the conference, it was humiliated there and resented its treatment. Austria-Hungary gained a great deal of territory, which angered the South Slavs and led to decades of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nBismarck became the target of hatred by Russian nationalists and Pan-Slavists, and he later found that he had tied Germany too closely to Austria-Hungary in the Balkans.<ref>Jerome L. Blum, et al. ''The European World: A History'' (1970) p. 841</ref>\n\nIn the long run, tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary intensified, as did the nationality question in the Balkans. The Congress was aimed at revising the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] and at keeping [[Constantinople]] within Ottoman hands. It effectively disavowed Russia's victory over the decaying Ottoman Empire during the Russo-Turkish War. The Congress returned territories to the Ottoman Empire that the earlier treaty had given to the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], most notably [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], thus setting up a strong revanchist demand in Bulgaria, which led to the 1912 First Balkan War.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Edward Stanford 1877.jpg|left|thumb|Pro-Greek ethnic map of the [[Balkans]] by Ioannis Gennadius,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEyinJwjWIgC&pg=PA169 |first=I.

Stanford in 1877]]\n\nIn the decades leading up to the congress, Russia and the Balkans had been gripped by [[Pan-Slavism]], a movement to unite all the Balkan Slavs under one rule. That desire, which evolved similarly to the [[Pan-Germanism]] and [[Italian Unification|Pan-Italianism]], which had resulted in two unifications, took different forms in the various Slavic nations. In Imperial Russia, Pan-Slavism meant the creation of a unified Slavic state, under Russian direction, and was essentially a byword for Russian conquest of the Balkan peninsula.<ref>Ragsdale, Hugh, and V. N. Ponomarev. ''Imperial Russian Foreign Policy''. Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1993, p. 228.</ref> The realisation of the goal would give Russia control of the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosphorus]], thus economic control of the [[Black Sea]] and substantially greater geopolitical power. \n\nIn the Balkans, Pan-Slavism meant unifying the Balkan Slavs under the rule of a particular Balkan state, but the state that was meant to serve as the locus for unification was not always clear, as initiative wafted between Serbia and Bulgaria.  The creation of a Bulgarian [[exarch]] by the Ottomans in 1870 had been intended to separate the Bulgarians religiously from the Greek patriarch and politically from Serbia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan J.

How and even whether that was to proceed would be the major question to be answered at the Congress of Berlin.\n\n==Great powers in Balkans==\nThe Balkans were a major stage for competition between the European [[great powers]] in the second half of the 19th century. Britain and Russia had interests in the fate of the Balkans. Russia was interested in the region, both ideologically, as a pan-Slavist unifier, and practically, to secure greater control of the Mediterranean. Britain was interested in preventing Russia from accomplishing its goals. Furthermore, the [[Unification of Italy|Unifications of Italy]] and [[Unification of Germany|of Germany]] had stymied the ability of a third European power, Austria-Hungary, to expand its domain to the southwest any further. Germany, as the most powerful continental nation since the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] had little direct interest in the settlement and so was the only power that could mediate the Balkan question credibly.{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=135\u2013137}}\n\nRussia and Austria-Hungary, the two powers that were most invested in the fate of the Balkans, were allied with Germany in the conservative [[League of Three Emperors]], which had been founded to preserve the monarchies of [[Continental Europe]]. The Congress of Berlin was thus mainly a dispute among supposed allies of Bismarck and his German Empire, the arbiter of the discussion, would thus have to choose before the end of the congress which of their allies to support. That decision was to have direct consequences on the future of European geopolitics.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Norton Medlicott|title=Congress of Berlin and After|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU7YAQAAQBAJ|year=1963|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-24317-2|pages=14\u2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=135\u2013137}}\n\nOttoman brutality in the [[Serbian\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Serbian\u2013Ottoman War]] and the violent suppression of the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875\u201377)|Herzegovina Uprising]] fomented political pressure within Russia, which saw itself as the protector of the Serbs, to act against the Ottoman Empire.

The Ottomans recognised Montenegro, Romania and Serbia as independent, and the territories of all three of them were expanded. Russia created a large Principality of Bulgaria as an autonomous vassal of the sultan. That expanded Russia's sphere of influence to encompass the entire Balkans, which alarmed other powers in Europe. Britain, which had threatened war with Russia if it occupied [[Constantinople]],<ref>Ragsdale, Hugh, and V. N. Ponomarev. ''Imperial Russian Foreign Policy''. Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1993, pp. 239\u201340.</ref> and France did not want another power meddling in either the Mediterranean or the Middle East, where both powers were prepared to make large [[Scramble for Africa|colonial gains]]. Austria-Hungary desired Habsburg control over the Balkans, and Germany wanted to prevent its ally from going to war. German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] thus called the Congress of Berlin to discuss the partition of the Ottoman Balkans among the European powers and to preserve the League of Three Emperors in the face of the spread of European [[Liberalism#Spread of liberalism|liberalism]].{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=135\u2013138}}\n\nThe Congress was attended by Britain, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], Russia and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Delegates from [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] attended the sessions that concerned their states, but they were not members.\n\nThe Congress was solicited by Russia's rivals, particularly Austria-Hungary and Britain, and was hosted in 1878 by Bismarck. It proposed and ratified the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]]. The meetings were held at Bismarck's [[Reich Chancellery]], the former [[Radziwill]] Palace, from 13 June to 13 July 1878. The congress revised or eliminated 18 of the 29 articles in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]]. Furthermore, by using as a foundation the Treaties of [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Paris (1856)]] and of [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Washington]] (1871), the treaty rearranged the East.\n\n==Other powers' fear of Russian influence==\n[[File:Ernst-Ravenstein-Balkans-Ethnic-Map-1880.jpg|thumb|left|Ethnic composition map of the [[Balkans]] by the German-English cartographer [[Ernst Georg Ravenstein]] of 1870]]\n\nThe principal mission of the participants at the Congress was to deal a fatal blow to the burgeoning movement of [[pan-Slavism]]. The movement caused serious concern in Berlin and even more so in Vienna, which was afraid that the repressed Slavic nationalities would revolt against the [[Habsburgs]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] and the [[France|French]] governments were nervous about both the diminishing influence of the Ottoman Empire and the cultural expansion of Russia to the south, where both Britain and France were poised to colonise [[Egypt]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. By the Treaty of San Stefano, the Russians, led by Chancellor [[Alexander Gorchakov]], had managed to create in [[Bulgaria]] an autonomous principality, under the nominal rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. That sparked the [[Great Game]], the massive British fear of the growing Russian influence in the [[Middle East]]. The new principality, including a very large portion of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] as well as access to the [[Aegean Sea]], could easily threaten the [[Dardanelle Straits]], which separate the [[Black Sea]] from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The arrangement was not acceptable to the British, who considered the entire Mediterranean to be a British [[sphere of influence]] and saw any Russian attempt to gain access there as a grave threat to British power. On 4 June, before the Congress opened on 13 June, British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli|Lord Beaconsfield]] had already concluded the [[Cyprus Convention]], a secret alliance with the Ottomans against Russia in which Britain was allowed to occupy the strategically-placed island of [[Cyprus]]. The agreement predetermined Beaconsfield's position during the Congress and led him to issue threats to unleash a war against Russia if it did not comply with Ottoman demands. Negotiations between Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] and British Foreign Secretary [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] had already \"ended on 6 June by Britain agreeing to all the Austrian proposals relative to Bosnia-Herzegovina about to come before the congress while Austria would support British demands\".{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=20}}\n\n==Bismarck as host==\n[[File:Bismarck emperors Austria, Germany & Russia as puppets.jpg|thumb|Bismarck manipulates the emperors of Austria, Germany & Russia like a ventriloquist's puppets.]]\n[[File:Bulgaria San Stefano Berlin 1878 TB.png|thumb|Borders of Bulgaria according to the preliminary [[Treaty of San Stefano]] (red stripes) and the superseding [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] (solid red)]]\n\nThe Congress of Berlin is frequently viewed as the culmination of the battle between Chancellors [[Alexander Gorchakov]] of Russia and [[Otto von Bismarck]] of Germany. Both were able to persuade other European leaders that a free and independent [[Bulgaria]] would greatly improve the security risks posed by a disintegrating Ottoman Empire. According to historian [[Erich Eyck]], Bismarck supported Russia's position that \"Turkish rule over a Christian community (Bulgaria) was an anachronism which undoubtedly gave rise to insurrection and bloodshed and should therefore be ended\".<ref name=\"Eyck\">Erich Eyck, ''Bismarck and the German Empire'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 1964), pp. 245\u201346.</ref> He used the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] of 1875 as proof of growing animosity in the region.\n\nBismarck's ultimate goal during the Congress of Berlin was not to upset Germany's status on the international platform. He did not wish to disrupt the [[League of the Three Emperors]] by choosing between Russia and Austria as an ally.<ref name=\"Eyck\"/> To maintain peace in Europe, Bismarck sought to convince other European diplomats that dividing up the [[Balkans]] would foster greater stability. During the process, Russia began to feel cheated despite eventually gaining independence for Bulgaria. Problems in the alliances in Europe before the First World War eere thus noticeable.\n\nOne reason that Bismarck was able to mediate the various tensions at the Congress of Berlin was his diplomatic persona. He sought peace and stability when international affairs did not pertain to Germany directly. Since he viewed the current situation in Europe as favourable for Germany, any conflicts between the major European powers that threatened the status quo was against German interests. Also, at the Congress of Berlin, \"Germany could not look for any advantage from the crisis\" that had occurred in the Balkans in 1875.<ref name=\"Eyck\"/> Therefore, Bismarck claimed impartiality on behalf of Germany at the Congress, which enabled him to preside over the negotiations with a keen eye for foul play.\n\nThough most of Europe went into the Congress expecting a diplomatic show, much like the [[Congress of Vienna]], they were to be sadly disappointed. Bismarck, unhappy to be conducting the Congress in the heat of the summer, had a short temper and a low tolerance for malarky. Thus, any grandstanding was cut short by the testy German chancellor. The ambassadors from the small Balkan territories whose fate was being decided were barely even allowed to attend the diplomatic meetings, which were between mainly the representatives of the great powers.{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nAccording to [[Henry Kissinger]],<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Simon & Schuster\n| isbn = 0-671-51099-1\n| pages = 139\u2013143\n| last = Kissinger\n| first = Henry\n| title = Diplomacy\n| date = 1995-04-04\n}}</ref> the congress saw a shift in Bismarck's [[Realpolitik]]. Until then, as Germany had become too powerful for isolation, his policy was to maintain the League of the Three Emperors. Now that he could no longer rely on Russia's alliance, he began to form relations with as many potential enemies as possible.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Events leading to World War I}}\n\nBowing to Russia's pressure, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro were all declared independent principalities. Russia kept [[Bessarabia|South Bessarabia]], which it had annexed in the Russo-Turkish War, but the Bulgarian state that it had created was first bisected and then divided again into the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, both of which were given nominal autonomy, under the control of the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Oakes, Augustus, and R. B. Mowat. ''The Great European Treaties of the Nineteenth Century''. Clarendon Press, 1918, pp. 332\u201360.</ref> Bulgaria was promised autonomy, and guarantees were made against Turkish interference, but they were largely ignored. Romania received [[Northern Dobruja]]. Montenegro obtained [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], along with the primary Albanian regions of [[Podgorica]], [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] and [[Plav-Gusinje]]. The Ottoman government, or [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], agreed to obey the specifications contained in the Organic Law of 1868 and to guarantee the civil rights of non-Muslim subjects. The region of Bosnia-Herzegovina was handed over to the administration of Austria-Hungary, which also obtained the right to garrison the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], a small border region between Montenegro and Serbia. Bosnia and Herzegovina were put on the fast track to eventual annexation. Russia agreed that [[Macedonia region|Macedonia]], the most important strategic section of the Balkans, was too multinational to be part of Bulgaria and permitted it to remain under the Ottoman Empire. [[Eastern Rumelia]], which had its own large Turkish and Greek minorities, became an autonomous province under a Christian ruler, with its capital at [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]]. The remaining portions of the original \"Greater Bulgaria\" became the new state of Bulgaria.\n\nIn Russia, the Congress of Berlin was considered to be a dismal failure. After finally defeating the Turks despite many past inconclusive Russo-Turkish wars, many Russians had expected \"something colossal\", a redrawing of the Balkan borders in support of Russian territorial ambitions. Instead, the victory resulted in an Austro-Hungarian gain on the Balkan front that was brought about by the rest of the European powers' preference for a powerful Austria-Hungarian Empire, which threatened basically no one, to a powerful Russia, which had been locked in competition with Britain in the so-called [[Great Game]] for most of the century. Gorchakov said, \"I consider the Berlin Treaty the darkest page in my life\". Most Russian people furious over the European repudiation of their political gains, and though there was some thought that it represented only a minor stumble on the road to Russian hegemony in the Balkans, it actually gave Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia over to Austria-Hungary's sphere of influence and essentially removed all Russian influence from the area.<ref>Ragsdale, Hugh, and V. N. Ponomarev. ''Imperial Russian Foreign Policy''. Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1993, pp. 244\u201346.</ref>\n\nThe Serbs were upset with \"Russia... consenting to the cession of Bosnia to Austria\":{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=32}}\n\n<blockquote>[[Jovan Risti\u0107|Risti\u0107]] who was Serbia\u2019s first plenipotentiary at Berlin tells how he asked Jomini, one of the Russian delegates, what consolation remained to the Serbs. Jomini replied that it would have to be the thought that 'the situation was only temporary because within fifteen years at the latest we shall be forced to fight Austria.' 'Vain consolation!' comments Risti\u0107.{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=32}}</blockquote>\n\nItaly was dissatisfied with the results of the Congress, and the tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire were left unresolved. Bosnia-Herzegovina would also prove to be problematic for the Austro-Hungarian Empire in later decades. The [[League of the Three Emperors]], established in 1873, was destroyed since Russia saw lack of German support on the issue of Bulgaria's full independence as a breach of loyalty and the alliance. The border between Greece and Turkey was not resolved. In 1881, after protracted negotiations, a compromise border [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|was accepted]] after a naval demonstration of the great powers had resulted in the cession of [[Thessaly]] and the [[Arta Prefecture]] to Greece.\n\nThus, the Berlin Congress sowed the seeds of further conflicts, including the Balkan Wars and (ultimately) the [[First World War]]. In the 'Salisbury Circular' of 1 April 1878, the British Foreign Secretary, the [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]], clarified the objections of him and the government to the Treaty of San Stefano because of the favorable position in which it left Russia.<ref>Walker, Christopher J. (1980), ''Armenia: The Survival of A Nation'', London: Croom Helm, p. 112</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the British historian [[AJP Taylor]] wrote: \"If the treaty of San Stefano had been maintained, both the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary might have survived to the present day. The British, except for [[Disraeli|Beaconsfield]] in his wilder moments, had expected less and were therefore less disappointed. Salisbury wrote at the end of 1878: We shall set up a rickety sort of Turkish rule again south of the Balkans. But it is a mere respite. There is no vitality left in them.\"<ref>AJP Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1914\u20131918'', [[Oxford University Press]] (1954) p. 253</ref>\n\nThough the Congress of Berlin constituted a harsh blow to [[Pan-Slavism]], it, by no means, solved the question of the area. The Slavs in the Balkans were still mostly under non-Slavic rule, split between the rule of Austria-Hungary and the ailing Ottoman Empire. The Slavic states of the Balkans had learned that banding together since Slavs benefited them less than playing to the desires of a neighboring great power. That damaged the unity of the Balkan Slavs and encouraged competition between the fledgling Slav states.{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\nThe underlying tensions of the region would continue to simmer for thirty years until they again exploded in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u20131913. In 1914, the [[assassination of Franz Ferdinand]] the Austro-Hungarian heir, led to the [[First World War]]. In hindsight, the stated goal of maintaining peace and balance of powers in the Balkans obviously failed since the region would remain a source of conflict between the great powers well into the 20th century.{{sfn|Glenny|2000|p=151}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:A Synvet 1877.jpg|Map of the ethnic composition of the [[Balkans]] in 1877 by A.

The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]] that \"would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence\".{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=19}} \"High [Austro-Hungarian] military authorities desired...

This vigorous and exclusive instinct explains the historical phenomenon of an isolated group, small in numbers yet dominating a country inhabited by a majority of peoples of different races and conflicting aspirations, and playing a role in European affairs out of all proportions to its numerical importance or intellectual culture. This instinct is today awakened and gives warning that it feels the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina to be a menace which, by introducing fresh Slav elements into the Hungarian political organism and providing a wider field and further recruitment of the Croat opposition, would upset the unstable equilibrium in which the Magyar domination is poised.{{sfn|Albertini|1952|pp=33\u201334}}</blockquote>\n\n==Delegates==\n{{div col}}\n[[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] {{flagicon|United Kingdom}}\n* [[Benjamin Disraeli]] Earl of Beaconsfield (Prime Minister)\n* [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] (Foreign Secretary)\n* [[Odo Russell, 1st Baron Ampthill|Baron Ampthill]] (Ambassador to Germany)\n\n[[Russian Empire]] {{flagicon|Russian Empire}}\n* [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]] (Foreign Minister)\n* [[Pyotr Andreyevich Shuvalov|Count Shuvalov]] (Ambassador to Great Britain)\n* [[Pavel Ubri|Baron d'Oubril]] (Ambassador to Germany)\n\n[[German Empire]] {{flagicon|German Empire}}\n* [[Otto von Bismarck]] (Chancellor)\n* [[Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst|Prince Hohenlohe]] (Ambassador to France)\n* [[Bernhard Ernst von B\u00fclow]] (State Secretary for Foreign Affairs)\n\n[[Austria-Hungary]] {{flagicon|Austria-Hungary}}\n* [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy|Count Andr\u00e1ssy]] (Foreign Minister)\n* [[Alajos K\u00e1rolyi|Count K\u00e1rolyi]] (Ambassador to Germany)\n* [[Baron Heinrich Karl von Haymerle]] (Ambassador to Italy)\n\n[[French Third Republic|French Republic]] {{flagicon|France}}\n* [[William Henry Waddington|Monsieur Waddington]] (Foreign Minister)\n* Comte de Saint-Vallier\n* Monsieur Desprey\n\n[[Kingdom of Italy]] {{flagicon|Kingdom of Italy}}\n* [[Lodovico, Count Corti|Count Corti]] (Foreign Minister)\n* Count De Launay\n\n[[Ottoman Empire]] {{flagicon|Ottoman Empire}}\n* [[Alexander Karatheodori Pasha|Karatheodori Pasha]]\n* [[Sadullah Pasha]]\n* [[Mehmed Ali Pasha (marshal)|Mehmed Ali Pasha]]\n* [[Catholicos]] [[Mkrtich Khrimian]] (representing Armenian population)\n\n[[United Principalities|Romania]] {{flagicon|Romania}}\n* [[Ion Br\u0103tianu|Ion C.
