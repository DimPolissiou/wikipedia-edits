It serves [[Portland International Airport]] and is the eastern terminus of the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]], which connects travelers to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]] and [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]]. The station, which is located near the southern end of the arrivals hall of the airport's main passenger terminal, consists of a wedge-shaped [[island platform]], just beyond which both tracks join because the section approaching the terminal is [[single-track railway|single-track]]ed. In late 2018, the station recorded an average of 2,461 weekday boardings.\n\nPortland International Airport station was built as part of the Airport MAX project, which extended light rail service to the airport with the construction of a four-station, {{convert|5.5|mi|km|1|adj=on|abbr=out}} [[branch line]] of MAX near [[Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center]]. Construction of the station began in July 2000 and it opened on September 10, 2001. Trains serve the station for 22 hours daily; there are minimum [[headway]]s of 15 minutes during most of the day.

It serves [[Portland International Airport]] and is the eastern terminus of the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]], which connects travelers to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]] and [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]]. The station, which is located near the southern end of the arrivals hall of the airport's main passenger terminal, consists of a wedge-shaped [[island platform]], just beyond which both tracks join because the section approaching the terminal is [[single-track railway|single-track]]ed. In late 2018, the station recorded an average of 2,461 weekday boardings.\n\nPortland International Airport station was built as part of the Airport MAX project, which extended light rail service to the airport with the construction of a four-station, {{convert|5.5|mi|km|1|adj=on|abbr=out}} [[branch line]] of MAX near [[Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center]].

He focuses on the \"colonial speech economy,\" that is, the implicit rules that determined who was allowed to address whom and under what conditions, and describes how the qualities that inspired deference changed in the province from 1691 to 1764. The Quaker elite initially established a monopoly on political leadership based on what they believed to be their inherent civic virtue grounded in their religious and social class. By 1760, this view had been discredited and replaced with the consensus that civic virtue was an achieved, not an inherent, attribute and that it should be determined by the display of appropriate manliness and the valor of men who were willing to take up arms for the common defense of the colony. Further, Pennsylvanians came to believe that all white men, not just wealthy property owners, were equally capable of achieving political voice. Martial masculinity, therefore, became the defining characteristic of the ideal citizen and marked a significant transformation in the way individuals justified their right to represent the public interest.<ref>John Smolenski, \"From Men of Property to Just Men,\" ''Early American Studies, An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Fall 2005, Vol. 3 Issue 2, pp 253\u2013285</ref>\n\n==Sociology==\n[[Erving Goffman]], a Canadian-born [[sociology|sociologist]] and writer, explored the relationship between deference and demeanor in his 1967 essay \"The Nature of Deference and Demeanor\".<ref>{{Cite book|author=Erving Goffman|year=1967|title=Interaction Ritual|location=New York, NY|publisher=Anchor House|isbn=0-394-70631-5}}</ref> According to Goffman, a person with a poor demeanor will be held in lower esteem in the eyes of society. The same is true for people who behave in a good demeanor, however: society will hold them in a higher esteem. An example of this situation can be seen through the way a person acts in a social setting. e.g. a man pulling out a chair for a woman at a restaurant. On the other end of the spectrum, a person not bathing before they go to a fancy dinner party. These examples can be defined as presentational deference. Demeanor does not only limit itself to the actions of an individual, but also the appearance of an individual. A person offers themselves to a social group through a good appearance or a well demeanored appearance. When an individual has a well demeanored appearance it makes interaction between people easier. After a person is socially accepted to a group, it is expected that they will conform to interactional norms. Through acting on those norms, people receive deference.\n\n==Psychology==\nThere is ongoing debate among psychologists as to the extent to which deference in a relationship is determined by a person's innate [[personality type]] or is the result of a person's experiences and [[classical conditioning|conditioning]]. In [[interpersonal relationships]], a partner can assume a submissive role to fit in or to make him or herself acceptable to the other partner,<ref>{{Cite book|author=James J. Gross|title=Handbook of Emotion Regulation|publisher=Guilford Publications|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59385-148-4}}</ref> and can be a benign aspect of a relationship. On the other hand, it may be an indication of an interpersonal problem, such as [[Domestic violence|partner abuse]]. If one or both of the people are experiencing chronic, pervasive emotional distress then the sex partners or individuals may require psychological evaluation.\n\nIn interpersonal relationships, some people prefer or are willing to adopt a submissive role in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] or personal matters. The level and type of submission can vary from person to person, and from one context to another; and also is dependent on the other partner being willing to assume control in those situations. Some people can include occasional acts of submission in an otherwise [[conventional sex]] life, or adopt a submissive lifestyle.\n\n==Biology==\nSubmission is also a common behavior in the animal kingdom, with a prevalence that spans the whole vertebrate-invertebrate gamut. Signs of submission are used either to preempt dangerous combat (in which case they usually appear at the beginning of an encounter) or to establish a dominance hierarchy (in which case they usually appear after the encounter). Often the behaviors used to appease the opponent or yield to his authority are of a stereotyped nature (e.g., bowing of the head, crouching, prostration, placing the tail between the legs, lying on ones back, grooming) but can sometimes develop into elaborate ritualistic performances (e.g., food supplication by the submissive animal, regurgitation of food by the dominant and ingestion of the regurgitated food by the submissive). It is believed by some researchers that part of the instinctive machinery subserving these behaviors is related to that used to evade or withstand predator attacks where similar behaviors appear (e.g., crouching, prostration, lying on the back).<ref>Morris, Desmond.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow deeply into the soil (1 to 2 [[Chi (unit))|chi]]). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deeply would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pests Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nBeginning in 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] began to report excessive production of grains because of pressure from above to succeed. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 [[Tonne|tonnes]] from 1957 to 1961.<ref name=\":15\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref>\n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains.

Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref name=\"Yang\">{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine.

By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi.

Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\n{{see also|1958 Yellow River flood}}\n[[File:Luokou yellow river bridge visit zhou enlai 1958.jpg|thumb|Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] (center front) visited Luokou Yellow River Bridge during the 1958 Yellow River flood.<ref name=\":16\" />]]\nIn 1958, there was a notable regional [[1958 Yellow River flood|flood of the Yellow River]] which affected part of [[Henan Province]] and [[Shandong Province]].<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/wxzl/wxzl/2000-12/26/content_1671.htm|title=\u5173\u4e8e\u9ec4\u6cb3\u3001\u957f\u6c5f\u3001\u6dee\u6cb3\u3001\u6c38\u5b9a\u6cb3\u9632\u5fa1\u7279\u5927\u6d2a\u6c34\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff08\u6458\u8981\uff09_\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u5927\u7f51|website=www.npc.gov.cn|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2007-06/14/content_648957.htm|title=\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u505a\u597d\u9ec4\u6cb3\u9632\u6c5b\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f55\u4e0d\u80fd\u6389\u4ee5\u8f7b\u5fc3\uff1f|last=|first=|date=|website=The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://guoqing.china.com.cn/zhuanti/2017-07/13/content_41210848.htm|title=\u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u6c34\u707e\u6709\u54ea\u4e9b\uff1f_\u4e2d\u56fd\u7f51|last=|first=|date=|website=[[China Internet Information Center]]|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tongji.cnki.net/kns55/Navi/result.aspx?id=N2007080101&file=N2007080101000094&floor=1|title=\u7b2c\u516d\u8282 1958\u5e74\u9ec4\u6cb3\u6d2a\u6c34-\u300a\u4e2d\u56fd\u707e\u60c5\u62a5\u544a1949-1995\u300b-\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u5e93|last=|first=|date=|website=tongji.cnki.net|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref name=\":17\">{{Cite web|url=http://newpaper.dahe.cn/jrab/html/2009-07/13/content_199329.htm|title=1958\u5e74\u9ec4\u6cb3\u5927\u6c34\u707e\u7eaa\u5b9e|last=|first=|date=|website=newpaper.dahe.cn|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newpaper.dahe.cn/jrab/html/2009-07/20/content_201822.htm|title=\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u4e94\u6b21\u9ec4\u6cb3\u6c34\u707e|last=|first=|date=|website=newpaper.dahe.cn|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> It was reported as the most severe flood of [[Yellow River]] since 1933.<ref name=\"dahe1\" /><ref name=\"dahe\">{{Cite web|url=http://newpaper.dahe.cn/jrab/html/2009-07/20/content_201822.htm|title=\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u4e94\u6b21\u9ec4\u6cb3\u6c34\u707e|last=|first=|date=|website=newpaper.dahe.cn|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> In July 1958, the Yellow River flood affected 741,000 people in 1708 villages and inundated over 3.04 million [[Mu (unit of area)|mu]] (over half a million [[Acre|acres]]) of cultivated fields.<ref name=\"dahe1\">{{Cite web|url=http://newpaper.dahe.cn/jrab/html/2009-07/13/content_199329.htm|title=1958\u5e74\u9ec4\u6cb3\u5927\u6c34\u707e\u7eaa\u5b9e|last=|first=|date=|website=newpaper.dahe.cn|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> The largest torrent of the flood was smoothly directed into the [[Bohai Sea]] on July 27, and the government declared a \"victory over the flood\" after sending a rescue team of over 2 million people.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://politics.people.com.cn/GB/8198/54051/54053/3757306.html|title=\u9ec4\u6cb3\u9632\u6d2a\u6982\u8ff0|last=|first=|date=2005|website=politics.people.com.cn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> The spokesperson of the Flood Prevention Center of Chinese government stated on July 27, 1958, that:<ref name=\":17\" /><blockquote>This year we defeated the large flood without division of torrents or [[Dam failure|breaks on dams]], which secures the big harvest of the crops.

This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow deeply into the soil (1 to 2 [[Chi (unit))|chi]]). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deeply would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pests Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nBeginning in 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] began to report excessive production of grains because of pressure from above to succeed. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 [[Tonne|tonnes]] from 1957 to 1961.<ref name=\":15\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref>\n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains. On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref name=\"Yang\">{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country.

Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party.

The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well.

It covers areas such as biochemistry, genetics, pharmacology, pathology, anatomy, physiology and medical microbiology, among others. It is recognised as Sweden's best university and one of the largest, most prestigious [[medical universities]] in the world. It is the highest ranked in all Scandinavia. The [[Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute]] awards the Nobel Prize in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]]. The assembly consists of fifty professors from various medical disciplines at the university. The current [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of Karolinska Institute is [[Ole Petter Ottersen]], who took office in August 2017.\n\nThe Karolinska Institute was founded in 1810 on the island of [[Kungsholmen]] on the west side of [[Stockholm]]; the main [[campus]] was relocated decades later to Solna, just outside [[Stockholm Municipality|Stockholm]].  A second campus was established more recently in [[Flemingsberg]], [[Huddinge Municipality|Huddinge]], south of Stockholm.<ref>http://ki.se/en/about/ki-through-the-centuries retrieved: 8 June 2015</ref> The Karolinska Institute is consistently ranked among the top medical universities internationally in a number of ranking tables.\n\nThe Karolinska Institute is Sweden's third oldest medical school, after [[Uppsala University]] (founded in 1477) and [[Lund University]] (founded in 1666). It is one of Sweden's largest centres for training and research, accounting for 30% of the medical training and more than 40% of all academic medical and life science research conducted in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ki.se/en/research/research-at-karolinska-institutet|title=Research at Karolinska|access-date=14 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313035349/http://ki.se/en/research/research-at-karolinska-institutet|archive-date=13 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Karolinska University Hospital]], located in Solna and Huddinge, is associated with the university as a research and teaching hospital. Together they form an [[academic health science centre]]. While most of the medical programs are taught in Swedish, the bulk of the [[PhD]] projects are conducted in English. The institute's name is a reference to the [[Caroleans]].\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Gamla Karolinska Instututet 01.JPG|250px|thumb|Original Caroline Institute buildings at street ''Hantverkargatan'' in Kungsholmen, Stockholm]]\n\n===19th century ===\nThe Karolinska Institute was founded by King [[Karl XIII]] on 13 December 1810 as an \"academy for the training of skilled army surgeons\" after one in three soldiers wounded in the [[Finnish War|Finnish War against Russia]] died in field hospitals. Indeed, a report of the time came to the conclusion that \"the medical skills of the army barber-surgeons are manifestly inadequate, so Sweden needs to train surgeons in order to better prepare the country for future wars.\" Just one year later, in 1811, the Karolinska Institute was granted license to train not only surgeons but medical practitioners in general.\n\n[[Image:Kungsholmens glasbruk 1865.jpg|thumb|left|The institute's original building as it appeared in the early 1860s]]\nAs one of KI's first professors, [[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]] laid the foundations of the newly inaugurated institute's scientific orientation, which in 1816 is granted the name ''Carolinska Institutet'' (in reference to the [[Caroleans]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Risling M, Bellander BM, Cullheim S |title=Traumatic injuries in the nervous system |journal=Front Neurol |volume=3 |pages=26 |year=2012 |pmid=22375136 |pmc=3285774 |doi=10.3389/fneur.2012.00026}}</ref>). This name, however, didn't really make an impact at the time and so was expanded to ''Carolinska Medico Chirurgiska institutet'', which proved more popular, especially when preceded by the epithet ''Kongliga'' (Royal), as introduced in 1822. This original institute was situated in the Royal Bakery on [[Riddarholmen]] (a small but central island in Stockholm) and within a just a couple of years had grown to encompass four professorships in anatomy, natural history and pharmacy, theoretical medicine and practical medicine (internal medicine and surgery).\n\nAt around the same time Anders Johan Hagstr\u00f6mer, a professor of anatomy and surgery from the Collegium Medicum (the National Board of Health and Welfare of its day), was appointed the institute's first inspector, a post equivalent to today's president. In the same year, the institute moved to the old Glasbruk quarter on Norr M\u00e4larstrand, beside what is now the City Hall. The move across the waters of [[Riddarfj\u00e4rden]] was accomplished with the help of barges, one of which is said to have capsized, consigning parts of Hagstr\u00f6mer's collection of preparations to the lake bed. Despite this his library survives intact and today forms part of the KI-Swedish Society of Medicine museum at the institute's Hagstr\u00f6mer Library.\n\n[[Image:Widerstr\u00f6m, Karolina ur Cedersch\u00f6ld; En banbryterska (1913).jpg|upright|thumb|In 1884 [[Karolina Widerstr\u00f6m]] became the first woman to obtain a degree from the Karolinska Institute.]]\nIn 1861 the institute reached a significant milestone in being awarded the right to confer its own degrees; as such it was granted a status equal to that of a university. This, in turn, led to an increase in the size of the student body, necessitating the demolition of the old building on the Glasbruk plot and its replacement with a new, larger one. This new institute building was built in stages, mostly during the 1880s and into the first decade of the 20th century; it stands to this day, and has remained largely unchanged since its opening.\n\n[[Image:Caroline Institute 1906 Stockholm.jpg|thumb|left|The Karolinska Institute's main building in 1906]]\nAlthough it had already gained the right to confer general degrees, KI wasn't licensed to confer medical degrees until 1874. Previously, even though the institute could run courses in medicine, the right to confer medical degrees was almost exclusively that of Uppsala University. Following on from this change in the institute's status the first doctoral thesis was defended at KI by Alfred Levertin, on the subject of \"Om Torpa K\u00e4lla\". Just shortly thereafter the Medical Students' Union was formed.\n\nThe next decade was one of firsts. By 1880 the Karolinska Institute had started to accept women and so it was in 1884 that [[Karolina Widerstr\u00f6m]] became the first woman to obtain a bachelor's degree in medicine from the institute; she later went on to obtain a Licentiate degree in medicine and chose to specialise in women's medicine and gynaecology. [[Anna Stecks\u00e9n]] later became the first woman to obtain a doctorate from the university.\n\nJust five years later, following the death of [[Alfred Nobel]] in 1895, the Karolinska Institute received the right to select the recipient of the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology or Medicine. Since then, this assignment has given the Karolinska Institute a broad contact network in the field of medical science. Indeed, over the years, five of the institute's own researchers have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n\n===20th century ===\n[[File:Karolinska February 2013 03.jpg|thumb|KI Campus in [[Solna]]. [[Karolinska University Hospital]] is seen in the background.]]\nBy 1930 the Swedish parliament had decided that a new teaching hospital was needed and resolved to build the new facility at Norrbacka in the [[Solna]] area of Stockholm. The hospital was, from the start, planned to have its theoretical and practical functions side by side, essentially signalling the start of the KI's move to the new site. The chief architect appointed to design the building, later to be named the Karolinska Hospital after a proposal by the Karolinska Institute, was [[Carl Westman]]. Westman worked tirelessly on this project, allowing for completion of the main hospital building by 1940. The hospital was officially opened in the same year along with the new Department of Public Health, KI's first building co-located with the hospital complex, and by 1945 KI moved the last of its departments from Kungsholmen to the Norrbacka site, known to current students and staff as the institute's Solna Campus.\n\nThe Karolinska Institute was initially slow to adopt social change. Nanna Svartz became the Karolinska Institute and Sweden's first state-employed female professor in 1937; she was the only female academic of this rank until Astrid Fagr\u00e9us became the institute's second female professor almost thirty years later in 1965. However, by the mid-twentieth century student revolts were taking place regularly in the pursuit of greater social equality. It was in response to the largest of these revolts in 1968 that the name of the institute was shortened to the current form ''Karolinska Institutet'', or ''KI''.\n\n[[File:John's University (5540460707) (2).jpg|left|thumb|Campus in [[Huddinge]]]]\nBy the early 1970s the Huddinge Hospital became increasingly affiliated with the institute and, as more and more of the Karolinska Institute's departments start to move into the hospital buildings, the area developed to become what is KI's Huddinge campus today. It was here that the medical information centre for computer-based citation research (MIC) was set up, making the Karolinska Institute the first [[MEDLARS]] (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) Centre outside the United States. Similarly innovative work continued at the institute throughout the 1970s, with Sweden's first [[toxicology]] programme commencing at KI in 1976 and the establishment of a [[psychotherapy]] course in 1979. Furthermore, in 1977 the Stockholm Institute of Physiotherapy closed, with the study programme transferring to a new [[physiotherapy]] department at KI.\n\n[[File:Karolinska institutet juni 2013.jpeg|thumb|The institute's campus in Solna]]\nIn 1982 the Huddinge campus was expanded with the addition of the Novum Research Centre for the study of [[biotechnology]], oral biology, nutrition and toxicology, and [[structural biology|structural biochemistry]]. The number of departments was reduced from 150 to 30 in 1993 and programmes in optometry, biomedicine, and dental technology commenced. The other key feature of the 1990s was the institute's increasingly ambitious plans for commercialisation, as a result of which 'Karolinska Institutet Holding AB' and 'Karolinska Innovations AB' were formed to help the institute intensify its relations with the business community and facilitate scientists' attempts to commercialise their discoveries.\n\nThe year 1997 marked a major point in the history of the Karolinska Institute as it was finally granted official university status with a stated mission to \"contribute to the improvement of human health through research, education and information\". This newly acquired status later led to the incorporation of the Stockholm University of Health Sciences into KI, as a result of which seven new study programmes in occupational therapy, audionomy, midwifery, biomedical laboratory science, nursing, radiology nursing and dental hygiene, were added to KI's teaching portfolio. Around the same time the institute's public health science programme commenced bringing the total number of study programmes to nineteen. Similarly, by this point the institute possessed three student unions: The Medical Students' Union, the Dental Students' Union, and the Physiotherapy Students' Union.\n\n===21st century ===\n[[File:Aula Medica, Karolinska Institutet (8960275188).jpg|thumb|The Karolinska Institute's new lecture hall complex, Aula Medica]]\n\nWith the turn of the millennium the Karolinska Institute sought to strengthen its activities in the field of external education and research, forming dedicated companies to help it do so and later establishing a fundraising campaign with a target of raising an extra 1 billion kronor for research between 2007 and 2010. During the same period new programmes were established in [[medical informatics]], [[podiatry]], and [[psychology]] as well as master's programmes of one and two years duration, and in 2004, the Karolinska Institute appointed its first female president \u2013 Harriet Wallberg-Henriksson, professor of integrative physiology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ki.se/en/about/ki-through-the-centuries|title=KI through the centuries}}</ref>\n\nThe year 2010 marked yet another significant event in the history of the KI as the institute celebrated its 200th anniversary under the patronage of King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]]. Shortly thereafter, the institute withdrew from the [[League of European Research Universities]].<ref>[https://www.leru.org/files/The-First-Decade-Full-paper.pdf The First Decade]</ref> In 2013, Anders Hamsten assumed his new position as vice-chancellor of the Karolinska Institute, a position he held until when he resigned as in the wake of the [[Paolo Macchiarini#Allegations of research misconduct|Macchiarini affair]].<ref name=\"Hamsten_resignation\">{{cite web|title=Anders Hamsten steps down as Vice-Chancellor of Karolinska Institutet|url=http://ki.se/en/news/anders-hamsten-steps-down-as-vice-chancellor-of-karolinska-institutet|website=Karolinska Institutet|accessdate=13 February 2016|date=12 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Nobel Prize winners ==\n*'''1955''' [[Hugo Theorell]] becomes KI's first Nobel Laureate, receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries concerning the nature and mode of action of oxidation enzymes. \n*'''1967''' [[Ragnar Granit]] receives the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions to the analysis of retinal function and how optical nerve cells respond to light stimuli, colour and frequency. \n*'''1970''' [[Ulf von Euler]] receives the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions for discoveries concerning the humoral transmittors in the nerve terminals and the mechanism for their storage, release and inactivation. \n*'''1982''' [[Sune Bergstr\u00f6m]] and [[Bengt Samuelsson]] jointly receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning [[prostaglandins]] and related biologically active substances.\n*'''1981''' [[Torsten Wiesel]] and [[David H.

This ancient god was the son of Apollo and was generally accompanied by a snake. Over time, the snake became coiled around the staff borne by the god.\n\n===Snake bowl===\n\nThe snake bowl was originally depicted together with Asclepius' daughter, the virgin goddess of health [[Hygieia]] or Hygiea. The snake ate from her bowl, which was considered to bring good fortune. There is nothing to support the notion that the snake would secrete its venom into the bowl.\n\n===Cockerel===\n\nThe [[cockerel]] symbolises new life and was sacrificed to Asclepius by those who had recovered from illness. This is the meaning behind the Greek philosopher [[Socrates]]' last words after he drank the poisoned cup: \"Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius. Do pay it. Don't forget.\"\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Medicinska F\u00f6reningen i Solna 20060723.jpg|250px|thumb|Building of the Medical Students' Union ''Medicinska F\u00f6reningen'']]\nThe Karolinska Institute offers the widest range of medical education under one roof in Sweden. Several of the programmes include clinical training or other training within the healthcare system. The close proximity of the Karolinska University Hospital and other teaching hospitals in the Stockholm area thus plays an important role during the education.\nApproximately 6,000 full-time students are taking educational and single subject courses at Bachelor and Master levels at the Karolinska Institute.

Rather than investigating reports of scientific and ethical misconduct, the institute engaged in targeted retribution against the whistleblowers in an attempt to silence them.\n\nIn 2014, one of the institute's star surgeons, Paolo Macchiarini was accused by four former colleagues and co-authors of having falsified claims in his research.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fountain|first1=Henry|title=Leading Surgeon Is Accused of Misconduct in Experimental Transplant Operations|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/world/leading-surgeon-is-accused-of-misconduct-in-experimental-transplant-operations.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter repeatedly attempting to silence the whistleblowers, media coverage and public opinion finally forced the Institute to act, and in April 2015, the [[ethics committee]] of the institute issued a response to one set of allegations with regard to research ethics and peer review at the ''Lancet'', and found them to be groundless.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"Super-surgeon\" Macchiarini not guilty of misconduct, per one Karolinska investigation|url=http://retractionwatch.com/2015/04/14/super-surgeon-macchiarini-not-guilty-of-misconduct-per-one-karolinska-investigation/|work=Retraction Watch|date=14 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Karolinska Institute had also appointed an external expert, Bengt Gerdin, to review the charges, comparing the results reported to the medical record of the hospital; the report was released by Karolinska in May 2015.<ref name=science2015-05a>{{cite journal|last1=Vogel|first1=Gretchen|title=Report finds trachea surgeon committed misconduct|journal=Science|date=19 May 2015|doi=10.1126/science.aac4623}}</ref><ref name=science2015-05b>{{cite journal|last1=Vogel|first1=Gretchen|title=Karolinska releases English translation of misconduct report on trachea surgeon|journal=Science|date=27 May 2015|doi=10.1126/science.aac4649}}</ref><ref name=Gerdin.report>{{cite web|title=Gerdin Report (English) Assignment ref: 2-2184/2014|url=http://www.circare.org/info/pm/gerdin-finalrpt-20150513.pdf|publisher=Karolinska via CIRCARE|date=13 May 2015}}</ref> Gerdin found that Macchiarini had committed research misconduct in seven out of seven papers, by not getting ethical approval for the some of his operations, and misrepresenting the result of some of those operations, as well as work he had done in animals.<ref name=science2015-05a/><ref name=science2015-05b/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2015.17605 |pmid=26017424 |title=Artificial-windpipe surgeon committed misconduct |journal=Nature |volume=521 |issue=7553 |pages=406\u2013407 |year=2015 |last1=Cyranoski |first1=David |bibcode=2015Natur.521..406C |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nIn August 2015, after considering the findings and a rebuttal provided by Macchiarini, vice-chancellor of Karolinska Institute Anders Hamsten found that Macchiarini had acted \"without due care\" but had not committed misconduct.<ref>{{cite news|title=Trachea surgeon Macchiarini acted \"without due care,\" but is not guilty of misconduct: Karolinska|url=http://retractionwatch.com/2015/08/28/trachea-surgeon-macchiarini-acted-without-due-care-but-is-not-guilty-of-misconduct-karolinska/|work=Retraction Watch|date=28 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ki.se/en/news/visiting-professor-at-karolinska-institutet-cleared-from-suspicions-of-scientific-misconduct |publisher=[[Karolinska Institutet]] |title=Visiting Professor at Karolinska Institutet cleared from suspicions of scientific misconduct |first=Claes |last=Keisu |date=28 August 2015 |access-date = 12 February 2016}}</ref> The journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', which published Macchiarini's work, also published an article defending Macchiarini.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00118-X |pmid=26369448 |title=Paolo Macchiarini is not guilty of scientific misconduct |journal=The Lancet |volume=386 |issue=9997 |pages=932 |year=2015 |last1=The Lancet |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nON 5 January 2016, ''Vanity Fair'' published a story about Macchiarini romancing a journalist, which also called into question statements he had made on his CV.<ref name=RWneed>{{cite news|title=Reading about embattled trachea surgeon Paolo Macchiarini?

The Nobel Assembly consists of fifty professors in medical subjects at the Karolinska Institute, appointed by the faculty of the Institute, and is a private organisation which is formally not part of the Karolinska Institute. The main work involved in collecting nominations and screening nominees is performed by the Nobel Committee at the Karolinska Institute, which has five members. The Nobel Committee, which is appointed by the Nobel Assembly, is only empowered to recommend laureates, while the final decision rests with the Nobel Assembly.\n\nIn the early history of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which was first awarded in 1901, the laurates were decided upon by the entire faculty of the Karolinska Institute. The reason for creating a special body for the decisions concerning the Nobel Prize was the fact that the Karolinska Institute is a state-run university, which in turn means that it is subject to various laws that apply to government agencies in Sweden and similar Swedish public sector organisations, such as freedom of information legislation. By moving the actual decision making to a private body at Karolinska Institute (but not part of it), it is possible to follow the regulations for the Nobel Prize set down by the Nobel Foundation, including keeping the confidentiality of all documents and proceedings for a minimum of 50 years. Also, the legal possibility of contesting the decisions in e.g. administrative courts is removed.\n\nThe other two Nobel Prize-awarding bodies in Sweden, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Swedish Academy, are legally private organisations (although enjoying royal patronage), and have therefore not had to make any special arrangements to be able to follow the Nobel Foundation's regulations.\n\n==Notable alumni or faculty==\n{{Category see also|Karolinska Institute alumni|Karolinska Institute faculty}}\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius.jpg|[[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]]\nFile:Mosander Carl Gustav bw.jpg|[[Carl Gustaf Mosander]]\nFile:Widerstr\u00f6m, Karolina ur Cedersch\u00f6ld; En banbryterska (1913).jpg|[[Karolina Widerstr\u00f6m]]\nFile:Edman-1968.png|[[Pehr Edman]]\nFile:Ivar Wickman 2.jpg|[[Ivar Wickman]]\nFile:Nanna_Charlotta_Svartz.jpg|[[Nanna Svartz]]\nFile:Ulf von Euler.jpg|[[Ulf von Euler]]\nFile:Herbert Olivecrona.jpg|[[Herbert Olivecrona]]\nFile:Ragnar Granit.jpg|[[Ragnar Granit]]\nFile:Hugo Theorell nobel.jpg|[[Hugo Theorell]]\nFile:Sune Bergstr\u00f6m 3.jpg|[[Sune Bergstr\u00f6m]]\nFile:Nobel Laureate Torsten Wiesel in 2011 Photo by Markus Marcetic for Young Academy of Sweden.jpg|[[Torsten Wiesel]]\nFile:Tomas Lindahl 0113.jpg|[[Tomas Lindahl]]\nFile:Ewa Bjorling (M) nordisk samarbetsminister Sverige.

It covers areas such as biochemistry, genetics, pharmacology, pathology, anatomy, physiology and medical microbiology, among others. It is recognised as Sweden's best university and one of the largest, most prestigious [[medical universities]] in the world. It is the highest ranked in all Scandinavia. The [[Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute]] awards the Nobel Prize in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]]. The assembly consists of fifty professors from various medical disciplines at the university. The current [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of Karolinska Institute is [[Ole Petter Ottersen]], who took office in August 2017.\n\nThe Karolinska Institute was founded in 1810 on the island of [[Kungsholmen]] on the west side of [[Stockholm]]; the main [[campus]] was relocated decades later to Solna, just outside [[Stockholm Municipality|Stockholm]].  A second campus was established more recently in [[Flemingsberg]], [[Huddinge Municipality|Huddinge]], south of Stockholm.<ref>http://ki.se/en/about/ki-through-the-centuries retrieved: 8 June 2015</ref> The Karolinska Institute is consistently ranked among the top medical universities internationally in a number of ranking tables.\n\nThe Karolinska Institute is Sweden's third oldest medical school, after [[Uppsala University]] (founded in 1477) and [[Lund University]] (founded in 1666). It is one of Sweden's largest centres for training and research, accounting for 30% of the medical training and more than 40% of all academic medical and life science research conducted in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ki.se/en/research/research-at-karolinska-institutet|title=Research at Karolinska|access-date=14 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313035349/http://ki.se/en/research/research-at-karolinska-institutet|archive-date=13 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Karolinska University Hospital]], located in Solna and Huddinge, is associated with the university as a research and teaching hospital. Together they form an [[academic health science centre]]. While most of the medical programs are taught in Swedish, the bulk of the [[PhD]] projects are conducted in English. The institute's name is a reference to the [[Caroleans]].\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Gamla Karolinska Instututet 01.JPG|250px|thumb|Original Caroline Institute buildings at street ''Hantverkargatan'' in Kungsholmen, Stockholm]]\n\n===19th century ===\nThe Karolinska Institute was founded by King [[Karl XIII]] on 13 December 1810 as an \"academy for the training of skilled army surgeons\" after one in three soldiers wounded in the [[Finnish War|Finnish War against Russia]] died in field hospitals. Indeed, a report of the time came to the conclusion that \"the medical skills of the army barber-surgeons are manifestly inadequate, so Sweden needs to train surgeons in order to better prepare the country for future wars.\" Just one year later, in 1811, the Karolinska Institute was granted license to train not only surgeons but medical practitioners in general.\n\n[[Image:Kungsholmens glasbruk 1865.jpg|thumb|left|The institute's original building as it appeared in the early 1860s]]\nAs one of KI's first professors, [[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]] laid the foundations of the newly inaugurated institute's scientific orientation, which in 1816 is granted the name ''Carolinska Institutet'' (in reference to the [[Caroleans]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Risling M, Bellander BM, Cullheim S |title=Traumatic injuries in the nervous system |journal=Front Neurol |volume=3 |pages=26 |year=2012 |pmid=22375136 |pmc=3285774 |doi=10.3389/fneur.2012.00026}}</ref>). This name, however, didn't really make an impact at the time and so was expanded to ''Carolinska Medico Chirurgiska institutet'', which proved more popular, especially when preceded by the epithet ''Kongliga'' (Royal), as introduced in 1822. This original institute was situated in the Royal Bakery on [[Riddarholmen]] (a small but central island in Stockholm) and within a just a couple of years had grown to encompass four professorships in anatomy, natural history and pharmacy, theoretical medicine and practical medicine (internal medicine and surgery).\n\nAt around the same time Anders Johan Hagstr\u00f6mer, a professor of anatomy and surgery from the Collegium Medicum (the National Board of Health and Welfare of its day), was appointed the institute's first inspector, a post equivalent to today's president. In the same year, the institute moved to the old Glasbruk quarter on Norr M\u00e4larstrand, beside what is now the City Hall. The move across the waters of [[Riddarfj\u00e4rden]] was accomplished with the help of barges, one of which is said to have capsized, consigning parts of Hagstr\u00f6mer's collection of preparations to the lake bed. Despite this his library survives intact and today forms part of the KI-Swedish Society of Medicine museum at the institute's Hagstr\u00f6mer Library.\n\n[[Image:Widerstr\u00f6m, Karolina ur Cedersch\u00f6ld; En banbryterska (1913).jpg|upright|thumb|In 1884 [[Karolina Widerstr\u00f6m]] became the first woman to obtain a degree from the Karolinska Institute.]]\nIn 1861 the institute reached a significant milestone in being awarded the right to confer its own degrees; as such it was granted a status equal to that of a university. This, in turn, led to an increase in the size of the student body, necessitating the demolition of the old building on the Glasbruk plot and its replacement with a new, larger one. This new institute building was built in stages, mostly during the 1880s and into the first decade of the 20th century; it stands to this day, and has remained largely unchanged since its opening.\n\n[[Image:Caroline Institute 1906 Stockholm.jpg|thumb|left|The Karolinska Institute's main building in 1906]]\nAlthough it had already gained the right to confer general degrees, KI wasn't licensed to confer medical degrees until 1874. Previously, even though the institute could run courses in medicine, the right to confer medical degrees was almost exclusively that of Uppsala University. Following on from this change in the institute's status the first doctoral thesis was defended at KI by Alfred Levertin, on the subject of \"Om Torpa K\u00e4lla\". Just shortly thereafter the Medical Students' Union was formed.\n\nThe next decade was one of firsts. By 1880 the Karolinska Institute had started to accept women and so it was in 1884 that [[Karolina Widerstr\u00f6m]] became the first woman to obtain a bachelor's degree in medicine from the institute; she later went on to obtain a Licentiate degree in medicine and chose to specialise in women's medicine and gynaecology. [[Anna Stecks\u00e9n]] later became the first woman to obtain a doctorate from the university.\n\nJust five years later, following the death of [[Alfred Nobel]] in 1895, the Karolinska Institute received the right to select the recipient of the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology or Medicine. Since then, this assignment has given the Karolinska Institute a broad contact network in the field of medical science. Indeed, over the years, five of the institute's own researchers have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n\n===20th century ===\n[[File:Karolinska February 2013 03.jpg|thumb|KI Campus in [[Solna]]. [[Karolinska University Hospital]] is seen in the background.]]\nBy 1930 the Swedish parliament had decided that a new teaching hospital was needed and resolved to build the new facility at Norrbacka in the [[Solna]] area of Stockholm. The hospital was, from the start, planned to have its theoretical and practical functions side by side, essentially signalling the start of the KI's move to the new site. The chief architect appointed to design the building, later to be named the Karolinska Hospital after a proposal by the Karolinska Institute, was [[Carl Westman]]. Westman worked tirelessly on this project, allowing for completion of the main hospital building by 1940. The hospital was officially opened in the same year along with the new Department of Public Health, KI's first building co-located with the hospital complex, and by 1945 KI moved the last of its departments from Kungsholmen to the Norrbacka site, known to current students and staff as the institute's Solna Campus.\n\nThe Karolinska Institute was initially slow to adopt social change. Nanna Svartz became the Karolinska Institute and Sweden's first state-employed female professor in 1937; she was the only female academic of this rank until Astrid Fagr\u00e9us became the institute's second female professor almost thirty years later in 1965. However, by the mid-twentieth century student revolts were taking place regularly in the pursuit of greater social equality. It was in response to the largest of these revolts in 1968 that the name of the institute was shortened to the current form ''Karolinska Institutet'', or ''KI''.\n\n[[File:John's University (5540460707) (2).jpg|left|thumb|Campus in [[Huddinge]]]]\nBy the early 1970s the Huddinge Hospital became increasingly affiliated with the institute and, as more and more of the Karolinska Institute's departments start to move into the hospital buildings, the area developed to become what is KI's Huddinge campus today. It was here that the medical information centre for computer-based citation research (MIC) was set up, making the Karolinska Institute the first [[MEDLARS]] (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) Centre outside the United States. Similarly innovative work continued at the institute throughout the 1970s, with Sweden's first [[toxicology]] programme commencing at KI in 1976 and the establishment of a [[psychotherapy]] course in 1979. Furthermore, in 1977 the Stockholm Institute of Physiotherapy closed, with the study programme transferring to a new [[physiotherapy]] department at KI.\n\n[[File:Karolinska institutet juni 2013.jpeg|thumb|The institute's campus in Solna]]\nIn 1982 the Huddinge campus was expanded with the addition of the Novum Research Centre for the study of [[biotechnology]], oral biology, nutrition and toxicology, and [[structural biology|structural biochemistry]]. The number of departments was reduced from 150 to 30 in 1993 and programmes in optometry, biomedicine, and dental technology commenced. The other key feature of the 1990s was the institute's increasingly ambitious plans for commercialisation, as a result of which 'Karolinska Institutet Holding AB' and 'Karolinska Innovations AB' were formed to help the institute intensify its relations with the business community and facilitate scientists' attempts to commercialise their discoveries.\n\nThe year 1997 marked a major point in the history of the Karolinska Institute as it was finally granted official university status with a stated mission to \"contribute to the improvement of human health through research, education and information\". This newly acquired status later led to the incorporation of the Stockholm University of Health Sciences into KI, as a result of which seven new study programmes in occupational therapy, audionomy, midwifery, biomedical laboratory science, nursing, radiology nursing and dental hygiene, were added to KI's teaching portfolio. Around the same time the institute's public health science programme commenced bringing the total number of study programmes to nineteen. Similarly, by this point the institute possessed three student unions: The Medical Students' Union, the Dental Students' Union, and the Physiotherapy Students' Union.\n\n===21st century ===\n[[File:Aula Medica, Karolinska Institutet (8960275188).jpg|thumb|The Karolinska Institute's new lecture hall complex, Aula Medica]]\n\nWith the turn of the millennium the Karolinska Institute sought to strengthen its activities in the field of external education and research, forming dedicated companies to help it do so and later establishing a fundraising campaign with a target of raising an extra 1 billion kronor for research between 2007 and 2010. During the same period new programmes were established in [[medical informatics]], [[podiatry]], and [[psychology]] as well as master's programmes of one and two years duration, and in 2004, the Karolinska Institute appointed its first female president \u2013 Harriet Wallberg-Henriksson, professor of integrative physiology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ki.se/en/about/ki-through-the-centuries|title=KI through the centuries}}</ref>\n\nThe year 2010 marked yet another significant event in the history of the KI as the institute celebrated its 200th anniversary under the patronage of King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]]. Shortly thereafter, the institute withdrew from the [[League of European Research Universities]].<ref>[https://www.leru.org/files/The-First-Decade-Full-paper.pdf The First Decade]</ref> In 2013, Anders Hamsten assumed his new position as vice-chancellor of the Karolinska Institute, a position he held until when he resigned as in the wake of the [[Paolo Macchiarini#Allegations of research misconduct|Macchiarini affair]].<ref name=\"Hamsten_resignation\">{{cite web|title=Anders Hamsten steps down as Vice-Chancellor of Karolinska Institutet|url=http://ki.se/en/news/anders-hamsten-steps-down-as-vice-chancellor-of-karolinska-institutet|website=Karolinska Institutet|accessdate=13 February 2016|date=12 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Nobel Prize winners ==\n*'''1955''' [[Hugo Theorell]] becomes KI's first Nobel Laureate, receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries concerning the nature and mode of action of oxidation enzymes. \n*'''1967''' [[Ragnar Granit]] receives the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions to the analysis of retinal function and how optical nerve cells respond to light stimuli, colour and frequency. \n*'''1970''' [[Ulf von Euler]] receives the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions for discoveries concerning the humoral transmittors in the nerve terminals and the mechanism for their storage, release and inactivation. \n*'''1982''' [[Sune Bergstr\u00f6m]] and [[Bengt Samuelsson]] jointly receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning [[prostaglandins]] and related biologically active substances.\n*'''1981''' [[Torsten Wiesel]] and [[David H.

This ancient god was the son of Apollo and was generally accompanied by a snake. Over time, the snake became coiled around the staff borne by the god.\n\n===Snake bowl===\n\nThe snake bowl was originally depicted together with Asclepius' daughter, the virgin goddess of health [[Hygieia]] or Hygiea. The snake ate from her bowl, which was considered to bring good fortune. There is nothing to support the notion that the snake would secrete its venom into the bowl.\n\n===Cockerel===\n\nThe [[cockerel]] symbolises new life and was sacrificed to Asclepius by those who had recovered from illness. This is the meaning behind the Greek philosopher [[Socrates]]' last words after he drank the poisoned cup: \"Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius. Do pay it. Don't forget.\"\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Medicinska F\u00f6reningen i Solna 20060723.jpg|250px|thumb|Building of the Medical Students' Union ''Medicinska F\u00f6reningen'']]\nThe Karolinska Institute offers the widest range of medical education under one roof in Sweden. Several of the programmes include clinical training or other training within the healthcare system. The close proximity of the Karolinska University Hospital and other teaching hospitals in the Stockholm area thus plays an important role during the education.\nApproximately 6,000 full-time students are taking educational and single subject courses at Bachelor and Master levels at the Karolinska Institute. Annually, 20 upper high school students from all over Sweden get selected to attend Karolinska's 7-week long biomedical summer research school, informally named \"SoFo\".\n\n==Departments==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=25em|\n* Biosciences and Nutrition\n* Cell and Molecular Biology\n* Clinical Neuroscience\n* Clinical Science and Education, S\u00f6der Hospital\n* Clinical Science, Danderyd Hospital\n* Clinical Sciences, Intervention and Technology\n* Dental Medicine\n* Environmental Medicine\n* Laboratory Medicine\n* Learning, Informatics, Management and Ethics\n* Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics\n* Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics\n* Medicine, Huddinge\n* Medicine, Solna\n* Microbiology, Tumour and Cell Biology\n* Molecular Medicine and Surgery\n* Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society\n* Neuroscience\n* Oncology-Pathology\n* Physiology and Pharmacology\n* Public Health Sciences\n* Woman and Child Health\n}}\n\n==Rankings and reputation==\n{{Infobox world university ranking\n| ARWU_W = 38 | ARWU_W_ref =<ref>[http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2019.html Academic Ranking of World Universities 2019]</ref>\n| THE_W = 41 | THE_W_ref =<ref>[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/karolinska-institute World University Rankings 2019]</ref>\n| THE_W_Reputation = 61\u201370 | THE_W_Reputation_ref =<ref>[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/karolinska-institute]</ref>\n| USNWR_W = 51 | USNWR_W_ref =<ref>[https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings?page=6 US News Rankings 2010]</ref>\n}}\n\nThe Karolinska Institute is not listed in the overall [[QS World University Rankings]] since it only ranks multi-faculty universities.

The Nobel Assembly consists of fifty professors in medical subjects at the Karolinska Institute, appointed by the faculty of the Institute, and is a private organisation which is formally not part of the Karolinska Institute. The main work involved in collecting nominations and screening nominees is performed by the Nobel Committee at the Karolinska Institute, which has five members. The Nobel Committee, which is appointed by the Nobel Assembly, is only empowered to recommend laureates, while the final decision rests with the Nobel Assembly.\n\nIn the early history of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which was first awarded in 1901, the laurates were decided upon by the entire faculty of the Karolinska Institute. The reason for creating a special body for the decisions concerning the Nobel Prize was the fact that the Karolinska Institute is a state-run university, which in turn means that it is subject to various laws that apply to government agencies in Sweden and similar Swedish public sector organisations, such as freedom of information legislation. By moving the actual decision making to a private body at Karolinska Institute (but not part of it), it is possible to follow the regulations for the Nobel Prize set down by the Nobel Foundation, including keeping the confidentiality of all documents and proceedings for a minimum of 50 years. Also, the legal possibility of contesting the decisions in e.g. administrative courts is removed.\n\nThe other two Nobel Prize-awarding bodies in Sweden, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Swedish Academy, are legally private organisations (although enjoying royal patronage), and have therefore not had to make any special arrangements to be able to follow the Nobel Foundation's regulations.\n\n==Notable alumni or faculty==\n{{Category see also|Karolinska Institute alumni|Karolinska Institute faculty}}\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius.jpg|[[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]]\nFile:Mosander Carl Gustav bw.jpg|[[Carl Gustaf Mosander]]\nFile:Widerstr\u00f6m, Karolina ur Cedersch\u00f6ld; En banbryterska (1913).jpg|[[Karolina Widerstr\u00f6m]]\nFile:Edman-1968.png|[[Pehr Edman]]\nFile:Ivar Wickman 2.jpg|[[Ivar Wickman]]\nFile:Nanna_Charlotta_Svartz.jpg|[[Nanna Svartz]]\nFile:Ulf von Euler.jpg|[[Ulf von Euler]]\nFile:Herbert Olivecrona.jpg|[[Herbert Olivecrona]]\nFile:Ragnar Granit.jpg|[[Ragnar Granit]]\nFile:Hugo Theorell nobel.jpg|[[Hugo Theorell]]\nFile:Sune Bergstr\u00f6m 3.jpg|[[Sune Bergstr\u00f6m]]\nFile:Nobel Laureate Torsten Wiesel in 2011 Photo by Markus Marcetic for Young Academy of Sweden.jpg|[[Torsten Wiesel]]\nFile:Tomas Lindahl 0113.jpg|[[Tomas Lindahl]]\nFile:Ewa Bjorling (M) nordisk samarbetsminister Sverige.

This would replace the inefficient wagons used to haul ore to the iron furnaces at Bellefonte. The local iron and agricultural interests who chartered the road contracted out construction to Frank McLaughlin, a Philadelphia businessman, in exchange for a majority of the stock; he turned construction over to his business associates, the Collins brothers. Experienced contractors, they were working at the time on the [[Beech Creek Railroad]],<ref name=\"rudnicki\">{{cite journal | last1=Rudnicki | first1=Jack | last2=Bezilla | first2=Mike | year=2001 | title=From Iron Ore to Limestone and Lime...to Nothing | journal=National Railway Bulletin | volume=66 | issue=2 | pages=4\u201333}}</ref> and began grading the Bellefonte & Buffalo Run in March 1883.<ref name=\"news1883\">{{cite news | title=Odds and Ends 1883 | url=http://bellefonte.topcities.com/oddsends/1880s/1883/index.html | publisher=Democratic Watchman | date=1883-03-23 | accessdate=2006-12-03 | pages=8 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321081805/http://bellefonte.topcities.com/oddsends/1880s/1883/index.html | archive-date=2005-03-21 | url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the Bellefonte & Buffalo Run was graded to minimal standards of engineering, with little earthmoving and many curves.\n\nIn the meantime, McLaughlin and others chartered the '''Nittany Valley and Southern Railroad''' in January 1883. This line was proposed to run from Bellefonte to [[Mill Hall, Pennsylvania|Mill Hall]], providing a connection with the Beech Creek Railroad. (The Bellefonte & Buffalo Run's only connection in Bellefonte was the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].) However, capital was not forthcoming, and construction of the Bellefonte & Buffalo Run ended with the completion of the grading from Bellefonte to [[Struble, Pennsylvania|Struble]] in June 1883. This grade followed Buffalo Run from Bellefonte to [[Waddle, Pennsylvania|Waddle]], where a [[Horseshoe curve (railway)|horseshoe curve]] carried it across and out of the valley and it climbed eastward to the summit at Alto. From there it descended to the iron ore pits at Struble.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\n{{Infobox rail | gauge={{Track gauge|ussg|allk=on}}|\nrailroad_name=Buffalo Run, Bellefonte and Bald Eagle Railroad|\nlocale=[[Centre County, Pennsylvania]]|\nstart_year=1887|\nend_year=1892|\nsuccessor_line = Bellefonte Central Railroad|\nhq_city=[[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania|Bellefonte]]\n}}\n\nThe Bellefonte & Buffalo Run and Nittany Valley & Southern were merged on March 16, 1885, to form the '''Buffalo Run, Bellefonte and Bald Eagle Railroad''', under the presidency of [[James A.

Frazer's first goal was to reduce dependence on ore traffic by extending the railroad from a wye at [[Struble, Pennsylvania|Struble]] to [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]].<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, p. 37</ref> The branch would carry passenger traffic, less-than-carload freight, and coal for the college power plant.

However, the railroad discontinued passenger service on the Red Bank Branch in 1894. Many of the miners had left the area when ore banks shut down after [[Bellefonte Furnace]] went out of blast, and few riders remained for the Waddle\u2013Red Bank trains.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nSince the shutdown of [[Bellefonte Furnace]], President Frazer had been trying to reach a rate agreement with John Reilly of the furnace company. They came to terms in July 1892, and Reilly began making arrangements to restart ore mining and put the furnace back in blast. It resumed ironmaking in March 1893, and the Bellefonte Central acquired additional ore cars to serve the traffic.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 46\u201348</ref> At the end of April, Tom Shoemaker resigned as superintendent to tend to his expanding duties supervising Bellefonte Furnace and ore mining at [[Graysdale, Pennsylvania|Graysdale]]. He was replaced by Francis H. Thomas, a long-time [[Reading Railroad|Reading]] employee.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 48\u201349</ref> Unfortunately, the new furnace traffic would prove ephemeral. The [[Panic of 1893]] forced Bellefonte Furnace to shut down again in July, after only four months of operation. While the railroad was still shipping ore to the McCoy and Linn Iron Works, Shoemaker could find few other customers for Graysdale ore and its importance to the railroad again declined.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nDespite the poor economic times, the railroad's management remained confident. On May 10, 1894, the directors approved the extension of the main line from Struble to [[Pine Grove Mills, Pennsylvania|Pine Grove Mills]]. Such an extension had been contemplated as long ago as 1884, during the BRB&BE era. While Pine Grove Mills would originate some traffic through farming and logging, the extension was primarily contemplated as part of a larger route. By extending south from Pine Grove Mills to [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania|Huntingdon]], the line could connect with the [[Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad]], an independent railroad serving the Broad Top coal region. By linking to the [[Central Railroad of Pennsylvania (1891\u20131918)|Central Railroad of Pennsylvania]] at Bellefonte (built in 1893 over the contemplated Nittany Valley & Southern route), the Bellefonte Central could form part of a coal route tapping the Broad Top field on behalf of the [[New York Central]]. However, the route faced a formidable obstacle in the crossing of [[Tussey Mountain]]. Such a line would require [[Zig zag (railway)|switchback]]s or a long summit tunnel. The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] already occupied the only usable gap at [[Spruce Creek, Pennsylvania|Spruce Creek]] and would not look favorably on its new competitor for the Broad Top traffic. However, the economy remained slow, and the railroad found it difficult to obtain land at favorable prices.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 50\u201351</ref> After a little grading, the project stalled until 1896, when the railroad lifted the rail from the derelict Red Bank Branch west of Graysdale and used it to lay track on the extension.<ref name=\"news1896a\">{{cite news | title=Will Be Started In Ten Days | url=http://bellefonte.topcities.com/oddsends/1890s/1896/index.html | publisher=Democratic Watchman | date=1896-04-17 | accessdate=2007-01-27 | pages=4 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321080331/http://bellefonte.topcities.com/oddsends/1890s/1896/index.html | archive-date=2005-03-21 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Service on the extension opened to [[Bloomsdorf, Pennsylvania|Bloomsdorf]] in September 1896 and to Pine Grove Mills in December.<ref name=\"br54\">Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 54\u201355</ref> Despite a $75,000 subscription offered by the town of Stone Valley (now submerged under Lake Perez) to complete the extension to Huntingdon,<ref name=\"news1894\">{{cite news | title=Bellefonte Central's Extension | url=http://bellefonte.topcities.com/oddsends/1890s/1894/page6.html | publisher=Keystone Gazette | date=1894-11-16 | accessdate=2007-01-28 | pages=8 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929104716/http://bellefonte.topcities.com/oddsends/1890s/1894/page6.html | archive-date=2011-09-29 | url-status=dead }}</ref> the expense of further extension would clearly have outstripped the railroad's finances. The Bellefonte Central undertook no further construction towards Huntingdon.<ref name=\"br54\" />\n\nDespite the loss of ore traffic, the Bellefonte Central had managed to keep its financial house in good order during the 1890s. [[Penn State University]] had begun to represent an important source of freight and passenger traffic, although the railroad frequently clashed with the school over unpaid bills.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, p. 99</ref> In 1896, Professor John Price Jackson obtained permission from the railroad to run [[Overhead line|trolley wire]] over its tracks from State College to Struble. An old [[Philadelphia Traction Company]] trolley was operated by electrical engineering students over the line until 1905.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, p. 100</ref>\n\nOre traffic did see a resurgence, as the re-opened Bellefonte Furnace went from sporadic operation during the 1890s to a more sustained level in 1899 and 1900. To supply additional iron ore, the owners of the furnace bought the ore pits around [[Scotia, Pennsylvania|Scotia]] from the [[Carnegie Steel Company|Carnegie]] interests, who were switching to [[Mesabi Range]] ore. The Bellefonte Central relaid almost a mile of the abandoned Red Bank Branch from Graysdale to the mines of Mattern Bank and built a new line from [[Graysdale, Pennsylvania|Graysdale]] to Scotia to reach the Scotia mines, previously served by the Fairbrook Branch of the PRR. However, the railroad lost some of the furnace traffic in 1899 to the Central RR of PA. This railroad was owned by the same interests as Bellefonte Furnace, and in that year, it built a long trestle over the PRR to reach the furnace directly and connect with the Bellefonte Central. The furnace first switched its source of lime to a quarry along the Central RR of PA, instead of the Bellefonte Central, and in 1903, a new interchange between the Central RR of PA and the PRR allowed the furnace to shift inbound [[coke (fuel)|coke]] and outbound iron traffic to the Central as well. Furthermore, the Mesabi ores were beginning to replace local ore, even in Bellefonte.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\n===Search for new traffic===\nBellefonte Furnace closed on December 21, 1910, and [[Nittany Furnace]] in 1911. Their last contribution to the railroad's prosperity was the huge heaps of slag accumulated at the furnace sites: this was shipped over the Bellefonte Central to the PRR for use in construction projects. While the loss of furnace traffic would ultimately prove fatal to the Central RR of PA, the Bellefonte Central had found new sources of revenue. The McNitt-Huyett Lumber Company opened a mill at Waddle in 1909 and built an extensive network of 36&nbsp;inch (91.44&nbsp;cm) gauge track into the Scotia area, dual-gauging the Scotia branch and making use of the abandoned rights-of-way from the area's iron-mining heyday. The local timber was soon exhausted, and the branches to Mattern Bank and Scotia were abandoned in 1915. However, McNitt-Huyett built further extensions, and continued to haul logs to the Waddle mill until about 1919.<ref name=\"kline\">{{cite book | author=Kline Benjamin F. G., Jr. | origyear=1971 | title=Pitch Pine and Prop Timber | publisher=Friends of the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania/Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission | year=1999 | chapter=}}</ref> Furthermore, high calcium limestone deposits in [[Bald Eagle Mountain]], on the north side of the Buffalo Run valley, were now being exploited, much of their production going to steel mills in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. These quarries, eventually consolidated under the management of the [[Chemical Lime Company]], would replace the iron furnaces as the principal generators of traffic on the Bellefonte Central.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\nWith dreams of expansion towards Huntingdon long gone, the branch to Pine Grove Mills was removed in 1919.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web | url=http://bellefonte.com/heritage/BCR/BFCtime.html | title=Bellefonte Central timeline | accessdate=2007-01-27 | first1=Mike | last1=Bezilla | first2=Jack | last2=Rudnicki | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105015647/http://bellefonte.com/heritage/BCR/BFCtime.html | archive-date=2006-11-05 | url-status=dead }}</ref> However, a new opportunity to lengthen the railroad would arrive. In 1927, the PRR applied to abandon its little-used Fairbrook Branch. The Bellefonte Central, with the blessing of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]], bought the line from [[Fairbrook, Pennsylvania|Fairbrook]] to [[Stover, Pennsylvania|Stover]], and obtained trackage rights from Stover into [[Tyrone, Pennsylvania|Tyrone]]. A new line was built from Struble to Fairbrook (more direct than the roundabout and now abandoned route via Scotia), and service to Tyrone began in 1930. The object of the purchase was to send freight directly to the PRR main line at Tyrone, bypassing the circuitous route via Bellefonte. Furthermore, Professor Ernest L. Nixon (uncle of [[Richard Nixon]]) owned a large potato farm near Fairbrook and planned to turn the area into a major potato-growing region. Other traffic would include lumber, clay, and furnace slag. However, the resentful PRR refused to supply cars at Tyrone, and gave the same rate for interchange at Tyrone as at Bellefonte. With no rate differential to offset the costs of the longer run to Tyrone, it was uneconomical for the Bellefonte Central to interchange there.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" /> The stockholders brought in new management in the wake of this debacle, in 1933, and operations were suspended on the branch.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\n===Depression, World War II and decline===\nLitigation over interchange at Tyrone continued until 1938, ending with a decision unfavorable to the Bellefonte Central. The railroad promptly filed to abandon the line from State College to Stover, but approval was not granted until May 1941. The rails were removed by that November.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\nFrustrated in its expansion attempt, the Bellefonte Central was sustained throughout the [[Great Depression]] by the shipment of construction material to State College. [[Penn State University|Penn State]] extensively expanded its campus in the late 1920s and 1930s, in part to keep up with increased enrollment during the Depression, and many supplies traveled over the railroad. A new station was built on North Atherton Street in State College in 1930, and the line was cut back to the power plant. (The Hammond Building now occupies the old [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] to the original station.) Shipments from the lime quarries fell as the steel industry collapsed, and Chemical Lime went into bankruptcy in 1935. However, the company continued operating during the bankruptcy, and was prompted to modernize its operations, building a new rail-served lime plant at \"Chemical\" and abandoning quarrying for deep-shaft mining. While it was bought out by [[National Gypsum Company]] at the end of 1940, the modernization (paid for by a [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] loan) would keep the lime operation competitive for decades, and make it the largest shipper on the Bellefonte Central.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\nThe outbreak of [[World War II]] and the ensuing industrial demand further increased lime traffic. The war also brought about a brief resurgence in the Bellefonte Central's original source of revenue, iron ore. The Scotia Mining Company was formed at the beginning of the war to resume mining in Scotia, and built a new ore washer in 1942. The ore was initially trucked to Waddle for shipment, but after it was determined to be insufficiently pure, the company obtained Reconstruction Finance Corp. money for further improvements. A new 3&nbsp;mile (4.8&nbsp;km) spur was built from the main line at Lagarde (Alto) to a new [[beneficiation]] plant at Scotia. However, only 35&nbsp;carloads of ore were shipped before the [[Surrender of Japan]], and the resulting fall in iron ore prices made mining uneconomical once again.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\nWhile regular passenger service ended in 1946,<ref name=\"timeline\" /> post-war traffic remained strong, again largely on the basis of Penn State construction. The Bellefonte Central also carried construction materials for the building of local homes, as enrollment at Penn State increased under the [[GI Bill]]. Although the advent of trucking was steadily eating into the [[less-than-carload]] freight business, the railroad still handled bulk deliveries of food to Penn State and shipments of machinery, automobiles, and paper. While the delivery of [[coal]] to local homes ended in 1947, the railroad continued to haul about 470 cars per year of coal to supply the Penn State power plant. In 1953, the Bellefonte Central bought an [[EMD SW9]], its first [[diesel locomotive]], and retired its [[steam locomotive]] in 1956, after buying an [[EMD SW1200]].<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\nHowever, the best years of the railroad were now behind it: it recorded its highest operating income in 1955.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> In 1959, Penn State switched to trucks for coal shipments to its power plant, and scheduled service to State College ended. The collapse in traffic further accelerated in the 1960s, with the general decline of the Northeastern railroads. As the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] ([[Penn Central]] after 1968) deteriorated, rail shipments suffered increasingly long delays, for which the Bellefonte Central could not compensate.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" /> The era also saw the last passenger service over the railroad, a PRR special from [[Pittsburgh]] for the [[University of Pittsburgh]]\u2013Penn State [[American football|football]] game in 1964.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> After years of attempting to generate new traffic in State College, the Bellefonte Central finally gave up on the southern end of its line in 1974. The last train left State College on July 22, 1974, and 13&nbsp;miles (21&nbsp;km) of rail were pulled up from State College to Chemical in 1976. From now on, National Gypsum would be the railroad's only customer.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\n===Last years and abandonment===\n\nNew management came to both the lime plant and the railroad in 1976. The plant was bought by Domtar, while the Bellefonte Central was sold to [[Kyle Railways]]. Prospects still appeared reasonable for the railroad, as the plant at Chemical (bought by Domtar in 1976) had an extensive customer base. Most of the lime produced there went to steel mills in Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio. Ground lime was also shipped to glass manufacturers, and to chemical and paper companies. However, the Pennsylvania steel industry soon began to falter under the pressure of foreign competition and its own inefficiencies. As the steel industry fell, the lime market also collapsed, and Domtar shut down the plant at Chemical on July 1, 1982. The Bellefonte Central shut down the same day. The Chemical plant was sold in April 1983 to Confer Trucking, a local firm, which operated it at reduced capacity and had no need for rail service. Accordingly, the Bellefonte Central filed for abandonment in 1984. The 4.1&nbsp;miles (6.6&nbsp;km) from Chemical to [[Coleville, Pennsylvania|Coleville]] were removed in spring 1985.

Constructed in the late 19th century to haul local [[iron ore]] to furnaces in the Bellefonte region, it later hauled freight traffic to [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]] for steelmaking from local quarries. The line to State College was abandoned in 1974, and most of the remaining railroad in 1984, but a small portion is still used by the [[Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad]].\n\n==History==\n===Predecessors===\nThe railroad was originally incorporated on September 21, 1882, as the '''Bellefonte and Buffalo Run Railroad'''. The purpose of this line was to connect Bellefonte with [[Pennsylvania State University|Pennsylvania State College]], and to tap the iron ore deposits along Buffalo Run. This would replace the inefficient wagons used to haul ore to the iron furnaces at Bellefonte. The local iron and agricultural interests who chartered the road contracted out construction to Frank McLaughlin, a Philadelphia businessman, in exchange for a majority of the stock; he turned construction over to his business associates, the Collins brothers. Experienced contractors, they were working at the time on the [[Beech Creek Railroad]],<ref name=\"rudnicki\">{{cite journal | last1=Rudnicki | first1=Jack | last2=Bezilla | first2=Mike | year=2001 | title=From Iron Ore to Limestone and Lime...to Nothing | journal=National Railway Bulletin | volume=66 | issue=2 | pages=4\u201333}}</ref> and began grading the Bellefonte & Buffalo Run in March 1883.<ref name=\"news1883\">{{cite news | title=Odds and Ends 1883 | url=http://bellefonte.topcities.com/oddsends/1880s/1883/index.html | publisher=Democratic Watchman | date=1883-03-23 | accessdate=2006-12-03 | pages=8 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321081805/http://bellefonte.topcities.com/oddsends/1880s/1883/index.html | archive-date=2005-03-21 | url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the Bellefonte & Buffalo Run was graded to minimal standards of engineering, with little earthmoving and many curves.\n\nIn the meantime, McLaughlin and others chartered the '''Nittany Valley and Southern Railroad''' in January 1883. This line was proposed to run from Bellefonte to [[Mill Hall, Pennsylvania|Mill Hall]], providing a connection with the Beech Creek Railroad. (The Bellefonte & Buffalo Run's only connection in Bellefonte was the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].) However, capital was not forthcoming, and construction of the Bellefonte & Buffalo Run ended with the completion of the grading from Bellefonte to [[Struble, Pennsylvania|Struble]] in June 1883. This grade followed Buffalo Run from Bellefonte to [[Waddle, Pennsylvania|Waddle]], where a [[Horseshoe curve (railway)|horseshoe curve]] carried it across and out of the valley and it climbed eastward to the summit at Alto.

Frazer's first goal was to reduce dependence on ore traffic by extending the railroad from a wye at [[Struble, Pennsylvania|Struble]] to [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]].<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, p. 37</ref> The branch would carry passenger traffic, less-than-carload freight, and coal for the college power plant.

However, the railroad discontinued passenger service on the Red Bank Branch in 1894. Many of the miners had left the area when ore banks shut down after [[Bellefonte Furnace]] went out of blast, and few riders remained for the Waddle\u2013Red Bank trains.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nSince the shutdown of [[Bellefonte Furnace]], President Frazer had been trying to reach a rate agreement with John Reilly of the furnace company. They came to terms in July 1892, and Reilly began making arrangements to restart ore mining and put the furnace back in blast. It resumed ironmaking in March 1893, and the Bellefonte Central acquired additional ore cars to serve the traffic.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 46\u201348</ref> At the end of April, Tom Shoemaker resigned as superintendent to tend to his expanding duties supervising Bellefonte Furnace and ore mining at [[Graysdale, Pennsylvania|Graysdale]]. He was replaced by Francis H. Thomas, a long-time [[Reading Railroad|Reading]] employee.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 48\u201349</ref> Unfortunately, the new furnace traffic would prove ephemeral. The [[Panic of 1893]] forced Bellefonte Furnace to shut down again in July, after only four months of operation. While the railroad was still shipping ore to the McCoy and Linn Iron Works, Shoemaker could find few other customers for Graysdale ore and its importance to the railroad again declined.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nDespite the poor economic times, the railroad's management remained confident. On May 10, 1894, the directors approved the extension of the main line from Struble to [[Pine Grove Mills, Pennsylvania|Pine Grove Mills]]. Such an extension had been contemplated as long ago as 1884, during the BRB&BE era. While Pine Grove Mills would originate some traffic through farming and logging, the extension was primarily contemplated as part of a larger route. By extending south from Pine Grove Mills to [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania|Huntingdon]], the line could connect with the [[Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad]], an independent railroad serving the Broad Top coal region. By linking to the [[Central Railroad of Pennsylvania (1891\u20131918)|Central Railroad of Pennsylvania]] at Bellefonte (built in 1893 over the contemplated Nittany Valley & Southern route), the Bellefonte Central could form part of a coal route tapping the Broad Top field on behalf of the [[New York Central]]. However, the route faced a formidable obstacle in the crossing of [[Tussey Mountain]]. Such a line would require [[Zig zag (railway)|switchback]]s or a long summit tunnel. The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] already occupied the only usable gap at [[Spruce Creek, Pennsylvania|Spruce Creek]] and would not look favorably on its new competitor for the Broad Top traffic. However, the economy remained slow, and the railroad found it difficult to obtain land at favorable prices.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 50\u201351</ref> After a little grading, the project stalled until 1896, when the railroad lifted the rail from the derelict Red Bank Branch west of Graysdale and used it to lay track on the extension.<ref name=\"news1896a\">{{cite news | title=Will Be Started In Ten Days | url=http://bellefonte.topcities.com/oddsends/1890s/1896/index.html | publisher=Democratic Watchman | date=1896-04-17 | accessdate=2007-01-27 | pages=4 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321080331/http://bellefonte.topcities.com/oddsends/1890s/1896/index.html | archive-date=2005-03-21 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Service on the extension opened to [[Bloomsdorf, Pennsylvania|Bloomsdorf]] in September 1896 and to Pine Grove Mills in December.<ref name=\"br54\">Bezilla & Rudnicki, pp. 54\u201355</ref> Despite a $75,000 subscription offered by the town of Stone Valley (now submerged under Lake Perez) to complete the extension to Huntingdon,<ref name=\"news1894\">{{cite news | title=Bellefonte Central's Extension | url=http://bellefonte.topcities.com/oddsends/1890s/1894/page6.html | publisher=Keystone Gazette | date=1894-11-16 | accessdate=2007-01-28 | pages=8 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929104716/http://bellefonte.topcities.com/oddsends/1890s/1894/page6.html | archive-date=2011-09-29 | url-status=dead }}</ref> the expense of further extension would clearly have outstripped the railroad's finances. The Bellefonte Central undertook no further construction towards Huntingdon.<ref name=\"br54\" />\n\nDespite the loss of ore traffic, the Bellefonte Central had managed to keep its financial house in good order during the 1890s. [[Penn State University]] had begun to represent an important source of freight and passenger traffic, although the railroad frequently clashed with the school over unpaid bills.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, p. 99</ref> In 1896, Professor John Price Jackson obtained permission from the railroad to run [[Overhead line|trolley wire]] over its tracks from State College to Struble. An old [[Philadelphia Traction Company]] trolley was operated by electrical engineering students over the line until 1905.<ref>Bezilla & Rudnicki, p. 100</ref>\n\nOre traffic did see a resurgence, as the re-opened Bellefonte Furnace went from sporadic operation during the 1890s to a more sustained level in 1899 and 1900. To supply additional iron ore, the owners of the furnace bought the ore pits around [[Scotia, Pennsylvania|Scotia]] from the [[Carnegie Steel Company|Carnegie]] interests, who were switching to [[Mesabi Range]] ore. The Bellefonte Central relaid almost a mile of the abandoned Red Bank Branch from Graysdale to the mines of Mattern Bank and built a new line from [[Graysdale, Pennsylvania|Graysdale]] to Scotia to reach the Scotia mines, previously served by the Fairbrook Branch of the PRR. However, the railroad lost some of the furnace traffic in 1899 to the Central RR of PA. This railroad was owned by the same interests as Bellefonte Furnace, and in that year, it built a long trestle over the PRR to reach the furnace directly and connect with the Bellefonte Central. The furnace first switched its source of lime to a quarry along the Central RR of PA, instead of the Bellefonte Central, and in 1903, a new interchange between the Central RR of PA and the PRR allowed the furnace to shift inbound [[coke (fuel)|coke]] and outbound iron traffic to the Central as well. Furthermore, the Mesabi ores were beginning to replace local ore, even in Bellefonte.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\n===Search for new traffic===\nBellefonte Furnace closed on December 21, 1910, and [[Nittany Furnace]] in 1911. Their last contribution to the railroad's prosperity was the huge heaps of slag accumulated at the furnace sites: this was shipped over the Bellefonte Central to the PRR for use in construction projects. While the loss of furnace traffic would ultimately prove fatal to the Central RR of PA, the Bellefonte Central had found new sources of revenue. The McNitt-Huyett Lumber Company opened a mill at Waddle in 1909 and built an extensive network of 36&nbsp;inch (91.44&nbsp;cm) gauge track into the Scotia area, dual-gauging the Scotia branch and making use of the abandoned rights-of-way from the area's iron-mining heyday. The local timber was soon exhausted, and the branches to Mattern Bank and Scotia were abandoned in 1915. However, McNitt-Huyett built further extensions, and continued to haul logs to the Waddle mill until about 1919.<ref name=\"kline\">{{cite book | author=Kline Benjamin F. G., Jr. | origyear=1971 | title=Pitch Pine and Prop Timber | publisher=Friends of the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania/Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission | year=1999 | chapter=}}</ref> Furthermore, high calcium limestone deposits in [[Bald Eagle Mountain]], on the north side of the Buffalo Run valley, were now being exploited, much of their production going to steel mills in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. These quarries, eventually consolidated under the management of the [[Chemical Lime Company]], would replace the iron furnaces as the principal generators of traffic on the Bellefonte Central.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\nWith dreams of expansion towards Huntingdon long gone, the branch to Pine Grove Mills was removed in 1919.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web | url=http://bellefonte.com/heritage/BCR/BFCtime.html | title=Bellefonte Central timeline | accessdate=2007-01-27 | first1=Mike | last1=Bezilla | first2=Jack | last2=Rudnicki | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105015647/http://bellefonte.com/heritage/BCR/BFCtime.html | archive-date=2006-11-05 | url-status=dead }}</ref> However, a new opportunity to lengthen the railroad would arrive. In 1927, the PRR applied to abandon its little-used Fairbrook Branch. The Bellefonte Central, with the blessing of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]], bought the line from [[Fairbrook, Pennsylvania|Fairbrook]] to [[Stover, Pennsylvania|Stover]], and obtained trackage rights from Stover into [[Tyrone, Pennsylvania|Tyrone]]. A new line was built from Struble to Fairbrook (more direct than the roundabout and now abandoned route via Scotia), and service to Tyrone began in 1930. The object of the purchase was to send freight directly to the PRR main line at Tyrone, bypassing the circuitous route via Bellefonte. Furthermore, Professor Ernest L. Nixon (uncle of [[Richard Nixon]]) owned a large potato farm near Fairbrook and planned to turn the area into a major potato-growing region. Other traffic would include lumber, clay, and furnace slag. However, the resentful PRR refused to supply cars at Tyrone, and gave the same rate for interchange at Tyrone as at Bellefonte. With no rate differential to offset the costs of the longer run to Tyrone, it was uneconomical for the Bellefonte Central to interchange there.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" /> The stockholders brought in new management in the wake of this debacle, in 1933, and operations were suspended on the branch.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\n===Depression, World War II and decline===\nLitigation over interchange at Tyrone continued until 1938, ending with a decision unfavorable to the Bellefonte Central. The railroad promptly filed to abandon the line from State College to Stover, but approval was not granted until May 1941. The rails were removed by that November.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\nFrustrated in its expansion attempt, the Bellefonte Central was sustained throughout the [[Great Depression]] by the shipment of construction material to State College. [[Penn State University|Penn State]] extensively expanded its campus in the late 1920s and 1930s, in part to keep up with increased enrollment during the Depression, and many supplies traveled over the railroad. A new station was built on North Atherton Street in State College in 1930, and the line was cut back to the power plant. (The Hammond Building now occupies the old [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] to the original station.) Shipments from the lime quarries fell as the steel industry collapsed, and Chemical Lime went into bankruptcy in 1935. However, the company continued operating during the bankruptcy, and was prompted to modernize its operations, building a new rail-served lime plant at \"Chemical\" and abandoning quarrying for deep-shaft mining. While it was bought out by [[National Gypsum Company]] at the end of 1940, the modernization (paid for by a [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] loan) would keep the lime operation competitive for decades, and make it the largest shipper on the Bellefonte Central.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\nThe outbreak of [[World War II]] and the ensuing industrial demand further increased lime traffic. The war also brought about a brief resurgence in the Bellefonte Central's original source of revenue, iron ore. The Scotia Mining Company was formed at the beginning of the war to resume mining in Scotia, and built a new ore washer in 1942. The ore was initially trucked to Waddle for shipment, but after it was determined to be insufficiently pure, the company obtained Reconstruction Finance Corp. money for further improvements. A new 3&nbsp;mile (4.8&nbsp;km) spur was built from the main line at Lagarde (Alto) to a new [[beneficiation]] plant at Scotia. However, only 35&nbsp;carloads of ore were shipped before the [[Surrender of Japan]], and the resulting fall in iron ore prices made mining uneconomical once again.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\nWhile regular passenger service ended in 1946,<ref name=\"timeline\" /> post-war traffic remained strong, again largely on the basis of Penn State construction. The Bellefonte Central also carried construction materials for the building of local homes, as enrollment at Penn State increased under the [[GI Bill]]. Although the advent of trucking was steadily eating into the [[less-than-carload]] freight business, the railroad still handled bulk deliveries of food to Penn State and shipments of machinery, automobiles, and paper. While the delivery of [[coal]] to local homes ended in 1947, the railroad continued to haul about 470 cars per year of coal to supply the Penn State power plant. In 1953, the Bellefonte Central bought an [[EMD SW9]], its first [[diesel locomotive]], and retired its [[steam locomotive]] in 1956, after buying an [[EMD SW1200]].<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\nHowever, the best years of the railroad were now behind it: it recorded its highest operating income in 1955.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> In 1959, Penn State switched to trucks for coal shipments to its power plant, and scheduled service to State College ended. The collapse in traffic further accelerated in the 1960s, with the general decline of the Northeastern railroads. As the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] ([[Penn Central]] after 1968) deteriorated, rail shipments suffered increasingly long delays, for which the Bellefonte Central could not compensate.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" /> The era also saw the last passenger service over the railroad, a PRR special from [[Pittsburgh]] for the [[University of Pittsburgh]]\u2013Penn State [[American football|football]] game in 1964.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> After years of attempting to generate new traffic in State College, the Bellefonte Central finally gave up on the southern end of its line in 1974. The last train left State College on July 22, 1974, and 13&nbsp;miles (21&nbsp;km) of rail were pulled up from State College to Chemical in 1976. From now on, National Gypsum would be the railroad's only customer.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n\n===Last years and abandonment===\n\nNew management came to both the lime plant and the railroad in 1976. The plant was bought by Domtar, while the Bellefonte Central was sold to [[Kyle Railways]]. Prospects still appeared reasonable for the railroad, as the plant at Chemical (bought by Domtar in 1976) had an extensive customer base. Most of the lime produced there went to steel mills in Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio. Ground lime was also shipped to glass manufacturers, and to chemical and paper companies. However, the Pennsylvania steel industry soon began to falter under the pressure of foreign competition and its own inefficiencies. As the steel industry fell, the lime market also collapsed, and Domtar shut down the plant at Chemical on July 1, 1982. The Bellefonte Central shut down the same day. The Chemical plant was sold in April 1983 to Confer Trucking, a local firm, which operated it at reduced capacity and had no need for rail service. Accordingly, the Bellefonte Central filed for abandonment in 1984. The 4.1&nbsp;miles (6.6&nbsp;km) from Chemical to [[Coleville, Pennsylvania|Coleville]] were removed in spring 1985. However, the last mile of track from Bellefonte to Coleville was bought by the SEDA-COG Joint Rail Authority, in order to make use of the enginehouse at Coleville. This track is now part of the [[Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad]], and the old Bellefonte Central enginehouse is now used for their locomotives.<ref name=\"rudnicki\" /> About a mile of the [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] on the grounds of [[The Arboretum at Penn State]] has been converted to a [[rail trail]], which was opened on May 22, 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arboretum.psu.edu/PDFs/Rail_Trail_Ribbon_Cutting_May19_2006.pdf | title=Bellefonte Central Rail Trail now open | accessdate=2007-01-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070202065252/http://www.arboretum.psu.edu/PDFs/Rail_Trail_Ribbon_Cutting_May19_2006.pdf| archivedate= 2 February 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==Stations==\n'''Main Line'''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bellefonte.com/heritage/BCR/BFCmap.html | title=Bellefonte Central Map | year=1923 | accessdate=2007-01-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040827113554/http://bellefonte.com/heritage/BCR/BFCmap.html | archive-date=2004-08-27 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Mileage!!Notes\n|-\n|[[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania|Bellefonte]] || 0.00 || Connection with Pennsylvania Railroad\n|-\n|[[Coleville, Pennsylvania|Coleville]] || 0.85 || Enginehouse and shops; site of Bellefonte Furnace\n|-\n|Morris || 2.31 ||\n|-\n|Stevens || 3.19 ||\n|-\n|Chemical || 3.54 || Site of Chemical Lime/National Gypsum/Domtar plant\n|-\n|Whitmer || ||\n|-\n|Linns || || \n|-\n|Hunter's Park || 5.40 || Amusement park built by the railroad\n|-\n|[[Fillmore, Pennsylvania|Fillmore]] || 6.72 ||\n|-\n|Sellers ||  ||\n|-\n|Briarly || 8.50 ||\n|-\n|[[Waddle, Pennsylvania|Waddle]] || 10.33 ||\n|-\n|Mattern Junction || || connection with Red Bank (later Scotia) Branch\n|-\n|Lagarde || 13.34 || or Alto; connection with branch to Scotia Mining Company\n|-\n|[[Krumrine, Pennsylvania|Krumrine]] || 16.10 ||\n|-\n|[[Struble, Pennsylvania|Struble]] || 17.47 || connection with Pine Grove Mills and Fairbrook Branches\n|-\n|[[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]] || 18.30 || station now a bus terminal\n|}\n\n'''Red Bank and Scotia Branches'''<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Mileage!!Notes\n|-\n|Mattern Junction || || connection with main line\n|-\n|[[Graysdale, Pennsylvania|Graysdale]] || || junction Scotia Branch\n|-\n|Mattern ||  ||\n|-\n|[[Stormstown, Pennsylvania|Stormstown]] Station ||  || at some distance from the town\n|-\n|Red Bank ||  || site of ore mining\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"left\"|'''Scotia Branch'''\n|-\n|[[Scotia, Pennsylvania|Scotia]] || || site of ore mining\n|}\n\n'''Pine Grove Mills Branch'''<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Mileage!!Notes\n|-\n|[[Struble, Pennsylvania|Struble]] || 0.0 || connection with main line\n|-\n|Bloomsdorf || ||\n|-\n|[[Pine Grove Mills, Pennsylvania|Pine Grove Mills]] || 3.5 ||station now Ferguson Township Elementary School\n|}\n\n'''Fairbrook Branch'''<ref>{{cite book | title=C.T. 1000E List of Stations and Sidings | year=1923 | publisher=[[Pennsylvania Railroad]]}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Mileage!!Notes\n|-\n|[[Struble, Pennsylvania|Struble]] || 0.0 || connection with main line\n|-\n|[[Fairbrook, Pennsylvania|Fairbrook]] || 5.4 || remainder of branch ex-PRR\n|-\n|[[Musser, Pennsylvania|Musser]] || 7.1 ||\n|-\n|[[Pennsylvania Furnace, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Furnace]] || 8.9 ||\n|-\n|Hostler || 10.6 ||\n|-\n|[[Marengo, Pennsylvania|Marengo]] || 12.4 ||\n|-\n|Furnace Road || 14.1 ||\n|-\n|[[Dungarvin, Pennsylvania|Dungarvin]] || 15.8 ||\n|-\n|[[Warriors Mark, Pennsylvania|Warriors Mark]] || 18.2 ||\n|-\n|[[Pennington, Pennsylvania|Pennington]] || 20.6 ||\n|-\n|[[Eyer, Pennsylvania|Eyer]] || 21.6 ||\n|-\n|[[Stover, Pennsylvania|Stover]] || 23.6 || Connection with Pennsylvania Railroad\n|}\n\n'''Scotia Branch (wartime)'''<ref name=\"rudnicki\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Mileage!!Notes\n|-\n|Lagarde || 0.0 || connection with main line\n|-\n|Scotia Mining Co.
