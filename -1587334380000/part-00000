The location was originally the junction of the main roads to [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], Liverpool and [[Wigan]], and was marked by a [[market cross]] going back to medieval times. During the 18th and 19th centuries the Cross, as the junction was known, was the location of a large lamp mounted on an obelisk with a circular drinking fountain for both people and animals around the base. This was moved to the junction of St Helens Road and Moor Street to make room for the erection of the clock tower in 1876. \n\nThe fountain was then moved again to opposite the Drill Hall down Southport Road in the 1890s when space was needed to site the Disraeli statue. The market was established by a [[royal charter]] that was granted by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1286 to the monks of [[Burscough Priory]]. Thursday has been market day in Ormskirk since at least 1292. The King also granted a borough charter to Ormskirk at about the same time, but this seems to have become extinct by the end of the 15th century.<ref name=assessment/>\n\nThe Ormskirk [[Poor Law Union]] was established in 1837, covering 21 parishes and townships from [[Tarleton]] to [[Simonswood]], and from [[Birkdale]] to Skelmersdale. Ormskirk Union Workhouse was built in 1853 on Wigan Road and later became [[Ormskirk and District General Hospital]].<ref>[http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Ormskirk/Ormskirk.shtml Workhouses.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628160052/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Ormskirk%2FOrmskirk.shtml |date=28 June 2009 }}, Ormskirk Workhouses</ref>\n\nWith its weekly markets, the town became a focal point for local farmers and their agricultural workers, cottagers, cow-keepers etc. to trade their goods and obtain necessities from the markets and from the retail establishments which were established along with public houses and inns. An engineering industry, based on making and mending agricultural machinery also developed.\n\nThe town became known for its gingerbread over the years when local women would bake the gingerbread in their own homes and then take it to the staging inns to sell to passengers. When the railway arrived in the mid 19th century, the local gingerbread sellers found a new market. They were allowed to sell their product to passengers travelling through the railway station. One particular customer [[Edward VII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], later Edward VII, enjoyed the local gingerbread so much he sent orders to the town. The baking of gingerbread became part of the retail history of the town, with several local bakers claiming to have the original gingerbread recipe. A well known local woman, Sally Woods, was a recognisable figure on the market selling her gingerbread.\n\n===Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul===\n[[File:Ormskirk Parish Church.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The distinctive tower and spire of [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Ormskirk|Ormskirk Parish Church]]]]\nThe [[parish church]] of [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Ormskirk|St Peter and St Paul]] is believed to be on the site of the original kirk, on a [[sandstone]] outcrop, and is the oldest building in the town. Its exact age is unknown; the building does contain some fragments of [[Norman architecture]].\n\nThe parish church has many connections with the [[Earl of Derby|Earls of Derby]] and the [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Stanley]] family. Many family members are buried in the church's Derby Chapel, including [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas Stanley]], the first Earl, who caused [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] to lose his crown by changing sides at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] in 1485, and the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby|James Stanley]], the seventh Earl, who was beheaded at [[Bolton]] in 1651 after the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. His body is buried in one coffin and his head in a separate casket.\n\nThis is one of only three [[Church of England parish church|parish churches]] in England to have a tower and a separate spire, and is unique in that it has both at the same end of the building. (The other two are [[St Mary's Church, Purton]] and [[St Andrew's Church, Wanborough]], both near [[Swindon]], in [[Wiltshire]]). Legend has it that Orme had two sisters, one who wanted a tower, and one who wanted a spire, and Orme built both to please both. \n\nThe 'steeple' in fact dates from the early 15th century, but the original blew down in 1731 and was rebuilt between 1790 and 1832. The large west tower was added to the church around 1548 to house the bells of nearby Burscough Priory following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. One of these bells can still be seen in the church.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Ormskirk railway station 2009 b.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Ormskirk railway station]].]]\nThe [[A59 road|A59]] is the main road, with [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] to the north and [[Liverpool]] to the south. The [[A570 road|A570]], from [[Southport]], crosses the town from west to east and provides a link to the national motorway network at junction 3 of the [[M58 motorway|M58]], about three miles from the town centre. It then continues to [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] before reaching the [[M62 motorway|M62]] at Junction 7, Rainhill Stoops.\n\nThe town's [[Ormskirk railway station|railway station]], which was refurbished at a cost of \u00a31&nbsp;million in 2009, is a northern terminus of [[Merseyrail]], and the line continues, with a change from electric to diesel multiple units, through to [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], after the direct service was partitioned in 1970. This line was promoted by the [[Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway]] in August 1846, but was completed by the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]]. The route and Ormskirk station opened on 2 April 1849, the undertaking being merged into the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] on 13 May 1859.\n\nThe [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] built the [[Skelmersdale Branch]] line to [[Skelmersdale]] and [[Rainford Junction]], which opened on 1 March 1858. Passenger services ended on 5 November 1956, goods to [[Rainford Junction]] finished on 16 November 1961 and to Skelmersdale on 4 November 1963.\n\n==Local economy==\nThere is a [[Morrisons]] on Park Road, which was converted from a [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] in 2005. The building was formerly home to the local gasworks, and the local [[Rover (marque)|Rover]]/[[Morris Motors|Morris]] car dealership (''Balmforths''). The ''Two Saints'' is a modest retail park which opened in 2000 and contains a number of retailers including [[McDonald's]], [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]], ''Mobility Store'', [[Poundland]], [[Aldi]] and a gym. In December 2013, when [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]] entered administration, its store at ''Two Saints'' closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ormskirk.gb.com/ormskirk/news_photo/A_blockbuster_of_a_sale_at_Ormskirk's_Blockbusters-52790962.htm|title=A blockbuster of a sale at Ormskirk's Blockbusters|publisher=www.ormskirk.gb.com|date=12 December 2013|accessdate=3 March 2017|first=Sophie|last=McCoid-Sou}}</ref> Ormskirk has an indoor market situated on Moorgate.

The location was originally the junction of the main roads to [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], Liverpool and [[Wigan]], and was marked by a [[market cross]] going back to medieval times. During the 18th and 19th centuries the Cross, as the junction was known, was the location of a large lamp mounted on an obelisk with a circular drinking fountain for both people and animals around the base. This was moved to the junction of St Helens Road and Moor Street to make room for the erection of the clock tower in 1876. \n\nThe fountain was then moved again to opposite the Drill Hall down Southport Road in the 1890s when space was needed to site the Disraeli statue. The market was established by a [[royal charter]] that was granted by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1286 to the monks of [[Burscough Priory]]. Thursday has been market day in Ormskirk since at least 1292. The King also granted a borough charter to Ormskirk at about the same time, but this seems to have become extinct by the end of the 15th century.<ref name=assessment/>\n\nThe Ormskirk [[Poor Law Union]] was established in 1837, covering 21 parishes and townships from [[Tarleton]] to [[Simonswood]], and from [[Birkdale]] to Skelmersdale. Ormskirk Union Workhouse was built in 1853 on Wigan Road and later became [[Ormskirk and District General Hospital]].<ref>[http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Ormskirk/Ormskirk.shtml Workhouses.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628160052/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Ormskirk%2FOrmskirk.shtml |date=28 June 2009 }}, Ormskirk Workhouses</ref>\n\nWith its weekly markets, the town became a focal point for local farmers and their agricultural workers, cottagers, cow-keepers etc. to trade their goods and obtain necessities from the markets and from the retail establishments which were established along with public houses and inns. An engineering industry, based on making and mending agricultural machinery also developed.\n\nThe town became known for its gingerbread over the years when local women would bake the gingerbread in their own homes and then take it to the staging inns to sell to passengers. When the railway arrived in the mid 19th century, the local gingerbread sellers found a new market. They were allowed to sell their product to passengers travelling through the railway station. One particular customer [[Edward VII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], later Edward VII, enjoyed the local gingerbread so much he sent orders to the town. The baking of gingerbread became part of the retail history of the town, with several local bakers claiming to have the original gingerbread recipe. A well known local woman, Sally Woods, was a recognisable figure on the market selling her gingerbread.\n\n===Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul===\n[[File:Ormskirk Parish Church.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The distinctive tower and spire of [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Ormskirk|Ormskirk Parish Church]]]]\nThe [[parish church]] of [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Ormskirk|St Peter and St Paul]] is believed to be on the site of the original kirk, on a [[sandstone]] outcrop, and is the oldest building in the town. Its exact age is unknown; the building does contain some fragments of [[Norman architecture]].\n\nThe parish church has many connections with the [[Earl of Derby|Earls of Derby]] and the [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Stanley]] family. Many family members are buried in the church's Derby Chapel, including [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas Stanley]], the first Earl, who caused [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] to lose his crown by changing sides at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] in 1485, and the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby|James Stanley]], the seventh Earl, who was beheaded at [[Bolton]] in 1651 after the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. His body is buried in one coffin and his head in a separate casket.\n\nThis is one of only three [[Church of England parish church|parish churches]] in England to have a tower and a separate spire, and is unique in that it has both at the same end of the building. (The other two are [[St Mary's Church, Purton]] and [[St Andrew's Church, Wanborough]], both near [[Swindon]], in [[Wiltshire]]). Legend has it that Orme had two sisters, one who wanted a tower, and one who wanted a spire, and Orme built both to please both. \n\nThe 'steeple' in fact dates from the early 15th century, but the original blew down in 1731 and was rebuilt between 1790 and 1832. The large west tower was added to the church around 1548 to house the bells of nearby Burscough Priory following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. One of these bells can still be seen in the church.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Ormskirk railway station 2009 b.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Ormskirk railway station]].]]\nThe [[A59 road|A59]] is the main road, with [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] to the north and [[Liverpool]] to the south. The [[A570 road|A570]], from [[Southport]], crosses the town from west to east and provides a link to the national motorway network at junction 3 of the [[M58 motorway|M58]], about three miles from the town centre. It then continues to [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] before reaching the [[M62 motorway|M62]] at Junction 7, Rainhill Stoops.\n\nThe town's [[Ormskirk railway station|railway station]], which was refurbished at a cost of \u00a31&nbsp;million in 2009, is a northern terminus of [[Merseyrail]], and the line continues, with a change from electric to diesel multiple units, through to [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], after the direct service was partitioned in 1970. This line was promoted by the [[Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway]] in August 1846, but was completed by the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844-1859|East Lancashire Railway]]. The route and Ormskirk station opened on 2 April 1849, the undertaking being merged into the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] on 13 May 1859.\n\nThe [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] built the [[Skelmersdale Branch]] line to [[Skelmersdale]] and [[Rainford Junction]], which opened on 1 March 1858. Passenger services ended on 5 November 1956, goods to [[Rainford Junction]] finished on 16 November 1961 and to Skelmersdale on 4 November 1963.\n\n==Local economy==\nThere is a [[Morrisons]] on Park Road, which was converted from a [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] in 2005. The building was formerly home to the local gasworks, and the local [[Rover (marque)|Rover]]/[[Morris Motors|Morris]] car dealership (''Balmforths''). The ''Two Saints'' is a modest retail park which opened in 2000 and contains a number of retailers including [[McDonald's]], [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]], ''Mobility Store'', [[Poundland]], [[Aldi]] and a gym.

The borough consists of a [[Sefton Coast|coastal strip of land]] on the [[Irish Sea]] which extends from Southport in the north to Bootle in the south, and an inland part to [[Maghull]] in the south-east. The district is bounded by the city of [[Liverpool]] to the south, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley]] to the south-east, and [[West Lancashire]] to the east.\n\nIt is named after the village and parish of [[Sefton, Sefton|Sefton]], near Maghull. When the borough was created in the Local Government Act 1972, a name was sought that would not unduly identify the borough with any of its constituent parts, particularly the former [[county borough]]s of Bootle and Southport. The locality had strong links with both the [[Earl of Sefton]] and the [[Earl of Derby]], resident of [[Knowsley Hall]], and given the fact that the immediately adjacent borough was subsequently named Knowsley it seems equally likely that the choice of name was derived from the names of the local nobility. A [[Sefton Rural District]] covering some of the villages in the district existed from 1894 to 1932.\n\n==Politics==\n===Liverpool City Region Combined Authority===\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2016}}\nThe Metropolitan Borough of Sefton is one of the six constituent local government districts of the [[Liverpool City Region]]. Since 1 April 2014, some of the borough's responsibilities have been pooled with neighbouring authorities within the metropolitan area and subsumed into the [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]].\n\nThe [[combined authority]] has effectively become the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and the leader of Sefton Council, along with the five other leaders from neighbouring local government districts, take strategic decisions over economic development, transport, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure.\n\nAs of July 2015, negotiations were taking place between the UK national government and the combined authority over a possible devolution deal to confer greater powers on the region, including whether to introduce an elected 'Metro Mayor' to oversee the entire metropolitan area.<ref>{{cite web|author=Liam Murphy|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-city-region-decide-devolution-9711105|title=Liverpool city region to decide on devolution demands by end of summer|date=22 July 2015|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Historic controversy===\nThe existence of Sefton has been an ongoing local controversy, especially in [[Southport]], where local [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] and councillors have campaigned for separation from [[Bootle]] and the possible inclusion of the town as a district in the [[non-metropolitan county]] of [[Lancashire]].<ref>Final Recommendations on the Future Local Government of Sefton, Local Government Commission for England, November 1997.</ref> It was highlighted after the 2012 local government election that different regions in Sefton had vastly different socio-economic backgrounds and needs.

The locality had strong links with both the [[Earl of Sefton]] and the [[Earl of Derby]], resident of [[Knowsley Hall]], and given the fact that the immediately adjacent borough was subsequently named Knowsley it seems equally likely that the choice of name was derived from the names of the local nobility. A [[Sefton Rural District]] covering some of the villages in the district existed from 1894 to 1932.\n\n==Politics==\n===Liverpool City Region Combined Authority===\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2016}}\nThe Metropolitan Borough of Sefton is one of the six constituent local government districts of the [[Liverpool City Region]]. Since 1 April 2014, some of the borough's responsibilities have been pooled with neighbouring authorities within the metropolitan area and subsumed into the [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]].\n\nThe [[combined authority]] has effectively become the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and the leader of Sefton Council, along with the five other leaders from neighbouring local government districts, take strategic decisions over economic development, transport, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure.\n\nAs of July 2015, negotiations were taking place between the UK national government and the combined authority over a possible devolution deal to confer greater powers on the region, including whether to introduce an elected 'Metro Mayor' to oversee the entire metropolitan area.<ref>{{cite web|author=Liam Murphy|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-city-region-decide-devolution-9711105|title=Liverpool city region to decide on devolution demands by end of summer|date=22 July 2015|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Historic controversy===\nThe existence of Sefton has been an ongoing local controversy, especially in [[Southport]], where local [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] and councillors have campaigned for separation from [[Bootle]] and the possible inclusion of the town as a district in the [[non-metropolitan county]] of [[Lancashire]].<ref>Final Recommendations on the Future Local Government of Sefton, Local Government Commission for England, November 1997.</ref> It was highlighted after the 2012 local government election that different regions in Sefton had vastly different socio-economic backgrounds and needs.

He wrote the introduction to Fox's account of the Dyke.

His [[MPhil]] thesis entitled \"Offa's Dyke Reviewed\" (1978) raised several questions concerning the accepted historiography of Offa's Dyke. Noble postulated that the gaps in the Dyke were not due to the incorporation of natural features as defensive barriers, but instead the gaps were a \"ridden boundary\", perhaps incorporating [[palisade]]s, that left no [[archaeological]] trace.  Noble also helped establish the Offa's Dyke Association, which maintains the [[Offa's Dyke Path]]. This [[long-distance footpath]] mostly follows the route of the dyke, and is a designated British [[National Trails|National Trail]].\n\n[[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]] wrote of Fox's study: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent.

Most recently Hill and Margaret Worthington have undertaken considerable research on the Dyke. Their work, though far from finished, has demonstrated that there is little evidence for the Dyke stretching from sea to sea. Rather, they claim that it is a shorter structure stretching from [[Rushock Hill]] north of the [[Herefordshire]] Plain to [[Llanfynydd, Flintshire|Llanfynydd]], near [[Mold, Flintshire]], some 64 miles (103&nbsp;km). According to Hill and Worthington, dykes in the far north and south may have different dates, and though they may be connected with Offa's Dyke, there is as yet no compelling evidence behind this.

But Bede says that the rampart was made of earth and timber, a description which would closer match Offa's Dyke than [[Hadrian's Wall]], though it would describe the [[Antonine Wall]]:\n<blockquote>\nAfter many great and severe battles, (Severus) thought fit to divide that part of the island, which he had recovered, from the other unconquered nations, not with a wall, as some imagine, but with a rampart. For a wall is made of stones, but a rampart, with which camps are fortified to repel the assaults of enemies, is made of sods, cut out of the earth, and raised high above the ground, like a wall, having in front of it the trench whence the sods were taken, with strong stakes of wood fixed above it. Thus Severus drew a great trench and strong rampart, fortified with several towers, from sea to sea. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-0.txt ''Bede\u2019s Ecclesiastical History of England, Bk 1-5'']\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever, the solution to the problem lies a few chapters later in Bede's account. In Book One Chapter Twelve of Bede's ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Ecclesiastical History]]'', he writes that the Romans \"built a strong wall of stone directly from sea to sea in a straight line between the towns that had been built as strong-points, where Severus had built his earthwork ... straight from east to west\". The strong wall of stone cannot refer to the Antonine Wall or Offa's Dyke, so it clearly refers to Hadrian's Wall, especially as Offa's Dyke runs from north to south. Also, as Severus's earthwork is described as being in the same location as Hadrian's Wall, it cannot be Offa's Dyke either, so the earth rampart with a great trench that Bede refers to must be the [[Vallum (Hadrian's Wall)|Vallum]], the adjoining earthen barrier immediately south of Hadrian's Wall. Where Bede got it wrong was in attributing the Vallum to [[Septimius Severus]], and saying that it predated the Wall. In fact the Vallum was the work of [[Hadrian]], and slightly post-dated the Wall.\n\nEvidence has also been found that challenges the accepted date of the construction of Offa's Dyke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wansdyke21.org.uk/wansdyke/wanart/nurse1.htm#_edn2|title=Latest thinking about OFFA'S and WAT'S DYKES|publisher=New Welsh Review 52|date=16 October 2009}}</ref> In December 1999, Shropshire County Council archaeologists uncovered the remains of a hearth or fire on the original ground surface beneath [[Wat's Dyke]] near [[Oswestry]], England.

The report suggests that the dyke should be 'regarded as being contemporary with the other great 5th century linear earthwork, the Wansdyke in Wiltshire . . . an achievement of the post-Roman kingdom of the northern Cornovii, rather than a work of 7th\u20138th century Mercia.' However, Dr David Hill, senior research fellow, Centre for Angio-Saxon Studies, University of Manchester ('Offa Versus The Welsh' \u2013 British Archaeoiogy, December 2000) has argued for a date later than the 6th century for Wat's Dyke \u2013 that it was constructed as Gwynedd and North Powys briefly became a unified state. Evidence from both dykes suggests, he says, that people were not settling or spending much time in these 'wild zones'.\"</ref>\n\nIn 2014, excavations by the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust focused on nine samples of the Dyke near Chirk. Radio carbon dating of redeposited turf placed the construction between the years 541 and 651, and lower layers of construction are dated to as early as 430.

Rather, they claim that it is a shorter structure stretching from [[Rushock Hill]] north of the [[Herefordshire]] Plain to [[Llanfynydd, Flintshire|Llanfynydd]], near [[Mold, Flintshire]], some 64 miles (103&nbsp;km). According to Hill and Worthington, dykes in the far north and south may have different dates, and though they may be connected with Offa's Dyke, there is as yet no compelling evidence behind this. However, not all experts accept this view.<ref>[http://www.cpat.org.uk/offa/offrev.htm Ian Bapty review of Hill and Worthington, ''Offa's Dyke: History and Guide'', 2003]</ref>\n\n===Contrary evidence===\n'Ofer' means 'border' or 'edge' in Old English, giving rise to the possibility of alternative derivations for some border features associated with Offa.<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ofer#Old_English  Old English translation for 'ofer', ''Wiktionary.org'']</ref>\n\nThe Roman historian [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] in his book ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'', written around 369, mentions the [[Wall of Severus]], a structure built by [[Septimius Severus]] who was [[Roman Emperor]] between 193 and 211:\n<blockquote>\n''Novissimum bellum in Britannia habuit, utque receptas provincias omni securitate muniret, vallum per CXXXIII passuum milia a mari ad mare deduxit.

But Bede says that the rampart was made of earth and timber, a description which would closer match Offa's Dyke than [[Hadrian's Wall]], though it would describe the [[Antonine Wall]]:\n<blockquote>\nAfter many great and severe battles, (Severus) thought fit to divide that part of the island, which he had recovered, from the other unconquered nations, not with a wall, as some imagine, but with a rampart. For a wall is made of stones, but a rampart, with which camps are fortified to repel the assaults of enemies, is made of sods, cut out of the earth, and raised high above the ground, like a wall, having in front of it the trench whence the sods were taken, with strong stakes of wood fixed above it. Thus Severus drew a great trench and strong rampart, fortified with several towers, from sea to sea. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-0.txt ''Bede\u2019s Ecclesiastical History of England, Bk 1-5'']\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever, the solution to the problem lies a few chapters later in Bede's account. In Book One Chapter Twelve of Bede's ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Ecclesiastical History]]'', he writes that the Romans \"built a strong wall of stone directly from sea to sea in a straight line between the towns that had been built as strong-points, where Severus had built his earthwork ... straight from east to west\". The strong wall of stone cannot refer to the Antonine Wall or Offa's Dyke, so it clearly refers to Hadrian's Wall, especially as Offa's Dyke runs from north to south. Also, as Severus's earthwork is described as being in the same location as Hadrian's Wall, it cannot be Offa's Dyke either, so the earth rampart with a great trench that Bede refers to must be the [[Vallum (Hadrian's Wall)|Vallum]], the adjoining earthen barrier immediately south of Hadrian's Wall. Where Bede got it wrong was in attributing the Vallum to [[Septimius Severus]], and saying that it predated the Wall. In fact the Vallum was the work of [[Hadrian]], and slightly post-dated the Wall.\n\nEvidence has also been found that challenges the accepted date of the construction of Offa's Dyke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wansdyke21.org.uk/wansdyke/wanart/nurse1.htm#_edn2|title=Latest thinking about OFFA'S and WAT'S DYKES|publisher=New Welsh Review 52|date=16 October 2009}}</ref> In December 1999, Shropshire County Council archaeologists uncovered the remains of a hearth or fire on the original ground surface beneath [[Wat's Dyke]] near [[Oswestry]], England. [[Carbon dating]] analysis of the burnt charcoal and burnt clay ''in situ'' showed it was covered by earth on or around AD 446. Archaeologists concluded that this part of Wat's Dyke, so long thought of as Anglo-Saxon and a mid-8th-century contemporary of Offa's Dyke, must have been built 300 years earlier in the [[Sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman period]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hannaford|first=H.R|title=Archaeological Investigation on Wat's Dyke at Maes-y-Clawdd, Oswestry|publisher=Archaeology Service, Shropshire County Council|year=1999}}<br>\"The excavation produced some residual deposits of worn sherds of Roman Samian ware and coarseware pottery. The report suggests that the dyke should be 'regarded as being contemporary with the other great 5th century linear earthwork, the Wansdyke in Wiltshire . . . an achievement of the post-Roman kingdom of the northern Cornovii, rather than a work of 7th\u20138th century Mercia.' However, Dr David Hill, senior research fellow, Centre for Angio-Saxon Studies, University of Manchester ('Offa Versus The Welsh' \u2013 British Archaeoiogy, December 2000) has argued for a date later than the 6th century for Wat's Dyke \u2013 that it was constructed as Gwynedd and North Powys briefly became a unified state. Evidence from both dykes suggests, he says, that people were not settling or spending much time in these 'wild zones'.\"</ref>\n\nIn 2014, excavations by the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust focused on nine samples of the Dyke near Chirk. Radio carbon dating of redeposited turf placed the construction between the years 541 and 651, and lower layers of construction are dated to as early as 430. This evidence suggests that the Dyke may have been a long-term project by several Mercian kings, that was started during the early fifth century probably by Romano-Britons.<ref name=\"Offa's Dyke: built by multiple kings?\">{{cite journal|journal=Current Archaeology|title=Offa's Dyke: built by multiple kings?|date=June 2014|volume=XXV, No. 3|issue=291|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n==Current==\nThe England\u2013Wales border still mostly passes within a few miles of the course of Offa's Dyke through the [[Welsh Marches]].

It has followed broadly the same line since the 8th century, and in part that of [[Offa's Dyke]]; the modern boundary was fixed in 1536, when the former [[marcher lord]]ships which occupied the border area were abolished and new [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] boundaries were created.\n\nThe administrative boundary of Wales was confirmed in the [[Local Government Act 1972]].

It then loops south to include within England an area southwest of Chester, before rejoining the Dee, and then loops east of the river to include within Wales a large area known as [[Maelor]], formerly an [[exclave]] of [[Flintshire]], between [[Bangor-on-Dee]] (in Wales) and [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] (in England). Returning to the River Dee as far as [[Chirk]], the boundary then loops to the west, following Offa's Dyke itself for about {{convert|2|mi|0}}, and including within England the town of [[Oswestry]], before reaching the [[River Vyrnwy]] at [[Llanymynech]]. It follows the Vyrnwy to its confluence with the [[River Severn]], and then continues southwards, rising over [[Long Mountain (Powys)|Long Mountain]] east of [[Welshpool]]. East of [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]], the boundary again follows the line of Offa's Dyke for about {{convert|2|mi|0}}, before looping eastwards to include within Wales a large area near [[Churchstoke]]. It then runs westwards to the [[River Teme]], and follows the river southeastwards through [[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]] before turning south towards the [[River Lugg]] at [[Presteigne]], which is within Wales.\n\nThe boundary continues southwards across hills to the [[River Wye]], and follows the river upstream for a short distance to [[Hay-on-Wye]], on the Welsh side of the border. It continues southwards and rises through and across the [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]], following the [[Hatterall Ridge]] past [[Llanthony]] on the Welsh side and [[Longtown, Herefordshire|Longtown]] on the English side, to reach the [[River Monnow]] near [[Pandy, Monmouthshire|Pandy]]. It then generally follows the river, past [[Pontrilas]] (in England) and [[Skenfrith]] (in Wales), towards [[Monmouth]], looping eastwards to include the town itself and a surrounding area within Wales. At [[Redbrook]], the boundary again reaches the Wye, and follows the river southwards, past [[Tintern]] and [[Chepstow]] on the Welsh side, to its confluence with the Severn at the [[Severn Bridge]]. The boundary then continues down the [[Severn estuary]] towards the [[Bristol Channel]], with the small island of [[Flat Holm]] being administered as part of Wales and the neighbouring island of [[Steep Holm]] as part of England.\n\n=== Administrative boundary ===\nThe boundary passes between [[Flintshire]], [[Wrexham County Borough]], [[Powys]], and [[Monmouthshire]] in Wales and [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]], [[Herefordshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]] in England.\n\nThere are several places where the border runs along the centre of a lane or street, resulting in properties on one side of the street being in Wales and those on the other side being in England. Notable examples include Boundary Lane in [[Saltney]] and the main street of [[Llanymynech]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Wales.post-Roman.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Post-Roman Welsh kingdoms or tribes. The modern border between England and Wales is shown in purple.]]\n\n=== Origins ===\nBefore and during the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] occupation of [[Great Britain|Britain]], all the native inhabitants of the island (other than the Pictish/Caledonian tribes of what is now northern Scotland\u2014and also excepting the [[Lloegyr]] of greater south-east England) spoke [[Brythonic languages]], a sub-family of the [[Insular Celtic languages]], and were regarded as [[Brythons|Britons]]. The clear geographical divide between the mountainous western areas of southern Britain and the generally lower-lying areas to the east was reflected in the pattern of Roman occupation. The main Roman military bases for the control of what became [[Roman Wales|Wales]] were beyond the mountains, at ''[[Deva Victrix|Deva]]'' ([[Chester]]), ''[[Viroconium]]'' ([[Wroxeter]], near [[Shrewsbury]]), and ''[[Isca Augusta]]'' ([[Caerleon]], near [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]), all located close to the later national border.\n\nWhen the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|Roman garrison left]] around 410, the various parts of Britain were left to govern and defend themselves. The western area, later [[Wales]], had become largely Christian, and soon comprised a number of separate kingdoms, the largest being [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] in the northwest and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] in the east. Powys roughly coincided with the territory of the Celtic [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] tribe whose ''civitas'' or administrative centre during the Roman period was at ''Viroconium''. Gwynedd, at the height of its power, extended as far east as the Dee estuary. Gradually, from the 5th century onwards, [[Paganism|pagan]] tribes from the east, including the [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]], conquered eastern and southern Britain, which later became England.<ref name=davies>{{cite book |title= A History of Wales|last= Davies|first= John|year= 1993|publisher= Penguin|isbn= 0-14-028475-3}}</ref><ref name=rowley>{{cite book |title= The Welsh Border \u2013 archaeology, history and landscape|last= Rowley|first= Trevor|year= 1986|publisher= Tempus Publishing|isbn= 0-7524-1917-X}}</ref>\n\nIn the south, the Welsh [[kingdom of Gwent]] broadly covered the same area as the pre-Roman [[Silures]], traditionally the area between the rivers [[River Usk|Usk]], [[River Wye|Wye]] and the Severn estuary. It was centred at different times on ''[[Venta Silurum|Venta]]'' ([[Caerwent]]), from which it derived its name, and ''Isca Augusta'' (Caerleon). Gwent generally allied with, and at various times was joined with, the smaller Welsh kingdom of [[Ergyng]], centred in present-day southern Herefordshire west of the Wye (and deriving its name from the Roman town of ''[[Ariconium]]''); and the larger kingdom of [[Glywysing]] in modern [[Glamorgan]]. The name Glywysing may indicate that it was founded by a British native of ''[[Glevum]]'' ([[Gloucester]]).\n\n[[File:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|250px|left|Peoples of southern Britain, circa 600 AD]]\n\nThe [[Battle of Mons Badonicus]], circa 500, could have been fought near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] between the British, the victors, and Anglo-Saxons attempting to reach the Severn estuary, but its date and location are very uncertain and it may equally well have taken place in [[Somerset]] or [[Dorset]]. However, it is more certain that the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Wessex]] emerged in the 6th and 7th centuries in the upper [[Thames]] valley, [[Cotswolds]] and [[Hampshire]] areas. In 577, the [[Battle of Deorham]] in the southern Cotswolds was won by the Anglo-Saxons, and led to Wessex extending its control to the Severn estuary and the cities of Gloucester, [[Cirencester]], and Bath. This severed the land link between the Britons of Wales and [[Dumnonia|those of the south west peninsula]]. By about 600, however, the area of modern Gloucestershire east of the Severn, as well as most of [[Worcestershire]], was controlled by another group, the [[Hwicce]], who may have arisen from intermarriage between Anglo-Saxon and British leading families, possibly the successors to the pre-Roman [[Dobunni]]. The Hwicce came increasingly under Mercian hegemony.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Chester]] in 616, the forces of Powys and other allied Brythonic kingdoms were defeated by the [[Northumbria]]ns under [[\u00c6thelfrith of Northumbria|\u00c6thelfrith]]. This divided the Britons of Wales from those in [[Northern England]], including [[Lancashire]], Cumbria, and [[Southern Uplands|south west Scotland]], an area which became known as ''\"Yr [[Hen Ogledd]]\"'' or \"the Old North\". Within a few decades, the Welsh became engaged in further defensive warfare against the increasingly powerful kingdom of [[Mercia]], based at [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] in what became the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] of England. The capital of Powys, [[Pengwern]], at or near modern Shrewsbury, was conquered by [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] in 656 when he had become overlord of the Mercians. Powys then withdrew from the lowland areas now in southern [[Cheshire]], Shropshire and [[Herefordshire]], which became known to Welsh poets as \"The Paradise of Powys\".<ref name=davies/> The areas were occupied by Anglo-Saxon groups who became sub-kingdoms of Mercia, the ''Wreocens\u01e3te'' or [[Wrekinset]] in the northern part of what became [[Shropshire]], and the ''[[Magons\u00e6te]]'' in the southern part.<ref name=rowley/> Further south, the area north west of the Severn later known as the [[Forest of Dean]] seems to have remained in British (that is, Welsh) hands until about 760.<ref>{{cite book |title= Forest Story|last= Mansfield|first= R.J.|year= 1964}}</ref>\n\n=== Offa's Dyke ===\n[[File:Offa's Dyke near Clun.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Offa's Dyke]] near [[Clun]] in Shropshire]]\n\n{{main|Offa's Dyke}}\n\nAfter [[Ine of Wessex]] abdicated in 726, [[\u00c6thelbald of Mercia]] established Mercia's hegemony over the Anglo-Saxons south of the [[Humber]]. However, campaigns by Powys against Mercia led to the building of [[Wat's Dyke]], an earthwork boundary extending from the [[River Severn|Severn]] valley near Oswestry to the Dee at [[Basingwerk]] in what became [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]], perhaps to protect recently acquired lands.<ref name=davies/> After \u00c6thelbald was killed in 757, a brief civil war in Mercia then ended in victory for his distant cousin, [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]]. As king, he rebuilt Mercia's hegemony over the southern English through military campaigns, and also caused the construction of Offa's Dyke, around the years 770 and 780.<ref name=hill>{{cite book |title= Offa's Dyke \u2013 history and guide|last= Hill|first= David|author2=Margaret Worthington|year= 2003|publisher= Tempus Publishing|isbn= 0-7524-1958-7}}</ref>\n\n[[Offa's Dyke]] is a massive linear earthwork, up to {{convert|65|ft}} wide (including its surrounding ditch) and {{convert|8|ft}} high. It is much larger and longer than Wat's Dyke, but runs roughly parallel to it. The earthwork was generally dug with the displaced soil piled into a bank on the Mercian (eastern) side, providing an open view into Wales and suggesting that it was built by Mercia to guard against attacks or raids from Powys. The late 9th-century writer [[Asser]] wrote that Offa ''\"terrified all the neighbouring kings and provinces around him, and ... had a great dyke built between Wales and Mercia from sea to sea\"''. In the mid-20th century, Sir [[Cyril Fox]] completed a major survey of the Dyke and stated that it ran from the Dee to the Severn, as Asser suggested, but with gaps, especially in the Herefordshire area, where natural barriers of strong rivers or dense forests provided sufficient defence. More recent research by David Hill and Margaret Worthington concluded that there is little evidence for the Dyke stretching \"from sea to sea\", but that the earthwork built by Offa stretched some {{convert|64|mi}} between [[Rushock Hill]] near [[Kington, Herefordshire|Kington]] in Herefordshire, and [[Treuddyn]] in Flintshire. Earthworks in the far north and south, including sections overlooking the [[Wye valley]] and east of the Wye at [[Beachley]], may in their view have been built for different purposes at different times, although their conclusions are themselves disputed.<ref name=hill/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpat.org.uk/offa/offrev.htm |title=The Final Word on Offa's Dyke?

By the 9th century, the expanding power of Mercia led to it gaining control over Ergyng and nearby [[Hereford]]. The system of [[shire]]s which was later to form the basis of local administration throughout England and eventually Wales originated in Wessex, where it became established during the 8th century. Wessex and Mercia gradually established an occasionally unstable alliance, with Wessex gaining the upper hand. According to Asser, the southern Welsh kings, including Hywel ap Rhys of Glywysing, commended themselves to [[Alfred the Great]] of Wessex in about 885. Alfred's son [[Edward the Elder]] also secured homage from the Welsh, although sporadic border unrest continued. In the early 10th century, a document known as ''The Ordinance Concerning the Dunsaete'' records procedures for dealing with disputes between the English and the Welsh, and implies that areas west of the Wye in [[Archenfield]] were still culturally Welsh. It stated that the English should only cross into the Welsh side, and vice versa, in the presence of an appointed man who had the responsibility of making sure that the foreigner was safely escorted back to the crossing point.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/htt/1256.aspx |title=The end of the Romans and the beginning of the Saxons |author=Miranda Greene |publisher=Herefordshire Council |year=2005 |accessdate=18 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103173319/http://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/htt/1256.aspx |archive-date=3 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 926, Edward's successor [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]], \"King of the English\", summoned the Welsh kings including [[Hywel Dda]] of [[Deheubarth]] to a meeting at Hereford, and according to [[William of Malmesbury]] laid down the boundary between England and Wales, particularly the disputed southern stretch where he specified that the eastern bank of the Wye should form the boundary.\n\nBy the mid-eleventh century, most of Wales had become united under the king of [[Gwynedd]], [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]]. In 1055, he marched on Hereford and sacked the city. He also seized [[Morgannwg]] and the Kingdom of Gwent, together with substantial territories east of Offa's Dyke, and raided as far as Chester and [[Leominster]].<ref name=rowley/> He claimed sovereignty over the whole of Wales, a claim recognised by the English, and historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]] states that Gruffudd was ''\"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales.\"''.<ref name=davies/> However, after his most powerful ally \u2013 Earl Elfgar of Mercia and East Anglia \u2013 died, Harold and Tostig Godwinson took advantage of the situation \u2013 Gruffudd being besieged in Snowdonia \u2013 and invaded Wales. In 1063, Gruffudd was killed by his own men. Harold returned many of the Welsh princes their lands, so that after Harold's death at the [[Battle of Hastings]], Wales was again divided without a leader to resist the Normans.\n\n=== March of Wales ===\n[[File:Chepstow Castle and Bridge from Tutshill.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[River Wye]], [[Old Wye Bridge, Chepstow|1816 road bridge]] and [[Chepstow Castle|castle]] at [[Chepstow]]. The river forms the boundary between [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]] (left) and [[Gloucestershire]], England (right)]]{{main|Welsh Marches}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Norman conquest of England]], King [[William I of England|William]] installed one of his most trusted confidants, [[William FitzOsbern]], as Earl of Hereford. By 1071 he had started the building of [[Chepstow Castle]], the first castle in Britain built of stone, near the mouth of the Wye. It served as a base from which the Normans continued to expand westward into [[south Wales]], establishing a castle at Caerleon and extinguishing the Welsh kingdom of Gwent. William also installed [[Roger de Montgomerie]] at Shrewsbury, and [[Hugh d'Avranches]] at Chester, creating a new expansionist [[Marcher lord|earldom]] in each case. In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, Norman lands are recorded west of the Wye at Chepstow and [[Caldicot, Monmouthshire|Caldicot]] in the [[Gwent Levels]] ({{lang-cy|Gwent Is-coed}}); over the whole of north east Wales as far west as the [[River Clwyd]], an area known to the Welsh as the ''[[Perfeddwlad]]''; and west of Offa's Dyke, especially in Powys where a new castle was named, after its lord, Montgomery.<ref name=davies/>\n\n[[Domesday Book]] no doubt records the extent of English penetration into Wales. This suggests that Offa's Dyke still approximately represented the boundary between England and Wales. However, during the [[The Anarchy|anarchy of Stephen]] various Welsh princes were able to occupy lands beyond it, including [[Whittington, Shropshire]] (see [[Whittington Castle]]) and [[Maelor|Maelor Saesneg]], hitherto in England. These lands were brought under English lordship by [[Henry II of England]], but became [[Marcher lord]]ships, and so part of Wales. This involved a loss of direct rule by the English crown.<ref>P. Brown, P King and P. Remfry, 'Whittington Castle: the marcher fortress of the Fitz Warin family' ''Shropshire Archaeology and History'' LXXIX (2004), 106\u20138.</ref>\n\nOver the next four centuries, Norman lords established mostly small lordships, at times numbering over 150, between the Dee and Severn and further west. The precise dates and means of formation of the lordships varied, as did their size. Hundreds of small castles, mostly of the [[motte and bailey]] type, were built in the border area in the 12th and 13th centuries, predominantly by Norman lords as assertions of power as well as defences against Welsh raiders and rebels. Many new towns were established across the area, some such as Chepstow, [[Monmouth]], [[Ludlow]] and [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] becoming successful trading centres, and these tended to be a focus of English settlement. However, the Welsh continued to attack English soil and supported rebellions against the Normans.<ref name=davies/><ref name=rowley/>\n\n[[File:CymruLlywelyn.PNG|left|thumb|230px|Wales {{circa|1217}}. Yellow: areas directly ruled by [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]]; Grey: areas ruled by Llywelyn's vassals. Both the [[Kingdom of England]], and also Anglo-Norman marcher lordships in Wales, are shown in green.]]\n\nThe [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], or ''Marchia Wallia'', were to a greater or lesser extent independent of both the English monarchy and the [[Principality of Wales]], which remained based in Gwynedd in the north west of the country. By the early 12th century, they covered the areas which would later become [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and much of [[Flintshire]], Montgomeryshire, [[Radnorshire]], Brecknockshire, [[Glamorgan]], Carmarthenshire and [[Pembrokeshire]]. Some of the lordships, such as Oswestry, [[Whittington Castle|Whittington]], [[Clun]], and [[Wigmore, Herefordshire|Wigmore]] had been part of England at the time of Domesday, while others such as [[Powys Wenwynwyn|the Lordship of Powys]] were Welsh principalities that passed by marriage into the hands of Norman barons. In ecclesiastical terms, the ancient [[diocese]]s of [[Bishop of Bangor|Bangor]] and [[Diocese of St Asaph|St. Asaph]] in the north, and [[Diocese of St David's|St. David's]] and [[Diocese of Llandaff|Llandaff]] in the south, collectively defined an area which included both the Principality and the March, and coincided closely with later definitions of Wales.<ref name=davies/>\n\nThe [[Principality of Wales]] ({{lang-cy|Tywysogaeth Cymru}}) covered the lands ruled by the [[Prince of Wales]] directly, and was formally founded in 1216, and later recognised by the 1218 Treaty of Worcester between [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]], [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Prince of Gwynedd]], and King [[John of England]]. Encompassing two-thirds of modern Wales, the principality operated as an effectively independent entity from the reign of Llywelyn until 1283 (though it underwent a period of contraction during the early part of the reign of [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]] in the 1240s, and again for several years from the beginning of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]]'s rule in 1246). Its independence was characterised by a separate legal jurisprudence based on the well established laws of ''[[Welsh Law|Cyfraith Hywel]]'', and by the increasingly sophisticated [[Curia Regis|court]] of the [[Aberffraw]] dynasty.<ref name=davies/>\n\nThe [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284 followed the conquest of the Principality by [[Edward I of England]]. It assumed the lands held by the Princes of Gwynedd under the title \"[[Prince of Wales]]\" as legally part of the lands of England, and established shire counties on the English model over those areas. The [[Council of Wales and the Marches|Council of Wales]], based at [[Ludlow Castle]], was also established in the 15th century to govern the area.\n\n=== Formation of \"England and Wales\" and county boundaries ===\n{{main|Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542}}\n\nHowever, the Marches remained outside the shire system, and at least nominally outside the control of the English monarchy, until the first [[Laws in Wales Act]] was introduced in 1535 under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. This, and a further Act in 1542, had the effect of annexing Wales to [[Kingdom of England|England]] and creating a single state and legal [[jurisdiction]], commonly referred to as [[England and Wales]]. The powers of the marcher lordships were abolished, and their areas formed into new counties, or amalgamated into existing ones.\n\nAt this point, the boundary between England and Wales, which has existed ever since, was effectively fixed. In the border areas, five new counties were created \u2013 Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, Brecknockshire and Monmouthshire \u2013 and Flintshire gained some additional territory. However, several of the marcher lordships were incorporated in whole or in part into English counties. The lordships of Ludlow, Clun, [[Caus Castle|Caus]] and part of Montgomery were incorporated into Shropshire; and [[Wigmore, Herefordshire|Wigmore]], [[Huntington, Herefordshire|Huntington]], [[Clifford, Herefordshire|Clifford]] and most of [[Ewyas]] were included in Herefordshire. According to John Davies:<ref name=davies/>\n\n<blockquote>Thus was created the border between Wales and England, a border which has survived until today. It did not follow the old line of Offa's Dyke nor the eastern boundary of the Welsh dioceses; it excluded districts such as Oswestry and Ewias, where the Welsh language would continue to be spoken for centuries, districts which it would not be wholly fanciful to consider as ''Cambria irredenta''. Yet, as the purpose of the statute was to incorporate Wales into England, the location of the Welsh border was irrelevant to the purposes of its framers.</blockquote>\n\nAn 1844 Act of Parliament later abolished several [[enclave]]s. One of these, [[Welsh Bicknor]], was an exclave of Monmouthshire between Gloucestershire and Herefordshire.\n\n=== Monmouthshire ===\n{{main|Monmouthshire (historic)}}\n\nAlthough Monmouthshire was included in the 16th century legislation, it was treated anomalously, with the result that its legal status as a Welsh county fell into some ambiguity and doubt until the 20th century.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/history/pages/counties_monmouth.shtml |title=Monmouthshire |publisher=BBC |date=August 2009 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> It was omitted from the second Act of Union, which established the [[Court of Great Sessions in Wales|Court of Great Sessions]], and like English shires it was given two [[Knights of the Shire]], rather than one as elsewhere in Wales. However, in ecclesiastical terms, almost all of the county remained within the [[Diocese of Llandaff]], and most of its residents at the time spoke [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. In the late 17th century under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] it was added to the Oxford circuit of the [[Assize Court#England and Wales|English Assizes]], following which, according to the [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], it gradually \"came to be regarded as an English county\".<ref name=eb1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Monmouthshire |volume=18 |page=729}}</ref> Under that interpretation, the boundary between England and Wales passed down the [[Rhymney River|Rhymney valley]], along Monmouthshire's western borders with Brecknockshire and Glamorgan, so including [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], and other industrialised parts of what would now generally be considered to be [[South Wales]], within England.\n\nThe 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica unambiguously described the county as part of England, but noted that \"whenever an act [...] is intended to apply to [Wales] alone, then Wales is always coupled with Monmouthshire\". Some legislation and UK government decisions, such as the establishment of a \"Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire\" in 1908,<ref>{{cite web|title=National Archives: Welsh Office|url=http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/6/detail.html|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=18 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119193059/http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/6/detail.html|archivedate=19 November 2007}}</ref> referred to \"Wales and Monmouthshire\", so that it was treated as one with Wales rather than as a legal part of Wales. The county's status continued to be a matter of debate in Parliament, especially as Welsh nationalism and devolution climbed the political agenda in the 20th century. In 1921 the area was included within the [[Church in Wales]]. The [[Welsh Office]], established in 1966, included Monmouthshire within its remit, and in 1969 [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]], [[Secretary of State for Wales]], proposed to fully incorporate Monmouthshire into Wales. The issue was finally clarified in law by the [[Local Government Act 1972]],<ref name=bbc/> which provided that \"in every act passed on or after 1 April 1974, and in every instrument made on or after that date under any enactment (whether before, on or after that date) \"Wales\", subject to any alterations of boundaries...\" included \"the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport\".<ref>Local Government Act 1972 (c.70), sections 1, 20 and 269</ref> The legal boundary between England and Wales therefore passes along Monmouthshire's eastern boundaries with [[Herefordshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]], essentially along the [[River Monnow]] and [[River Wye]].\n\n==The border today==\n[[File:Severn Aerial.jpg|thumb|Looking [[southwest]] towards the [[Bristol Channel]] with England on the left and Wales on the right.

Subsequently, the border between England and Wales has taken on increasing legal and political significance.

Notable examples include Boundary Lane in [[Saltney]] and the main street of [[Llanymynech]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Wales.post-Roman.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Post-Roman Welsh kingdoms or tribes. The modern border between England and Wales is shown in purple.]]\n\n=== Origins ===\nBefore and during the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] occupation of [[Great Britain|Britain]], all the native inhabitants of the island (other than the Pictish/Caledonian tribes of what is now northern Scotland\u2014and also excepting the [[Lloegyr]] of greater south-east England) spoke [[Brythonic languages]], a sub-family of the [[Insular Celtic languages]], and were regarded as [[Brythons|Britons]]. The clear geographical divide between the mountainous western areas of southern Britain and the generally lower-lying areas to the east was reflected in the pattern of Roman occupation. The main Roman military bases for the control of what became [[Roman Wales|Wales]] were beyond the mountains, at ''[[Deva Victrix|Deva]]'' ([[Chester]]), ''[[Viroconium]]'' ([[Wroxeter]], near [[Shrewsbury]]), and ''[[Isca Augusta]]'' ([[Caerleon]], near [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]), all located close to the later national border.\n\nWhen the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|Roman garrison left]] around 410, the various parts of Britain were left to govern and defend themselves. The western area, later [[Wales]], had become largely Christian, and soon comprised a number of separate kingdoms, the largest being [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] in the northwest and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] in the east. Powys roughly coincided with the territory of the Celtic [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] tribe whose ''civitas'' or administrative centre during the Roman period was at ''Viroconium''. Gwynedd, at the height of its power, extended as far east as the Dee estuary. Gradually, from the 5th century onwards, [[Paganism|pagan]] tribes from the east, including the [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]], conquered eastern and southern Britain, which later became England.<ref name=davies>{{cite book |title= A History of Wales|last= Davies|first= John|year= 1993|publisher= Penguin|isbn= 0-14-028475-3}}</ref><ref name=rowley>{{cite book |title= The Welsh Border \u2013 archaeology, history and landscape|last= Rowley|first= Trevor|year= 1986|publisher= Tempus Publishing|isbn= 0-7524-1917-X}}</ref>\n\nIn the south, the Welsh [[kingdom of Gwent]] broadly covered the same area as the pre-Roman [[Silures]], traditionally the area between the rivers [[River Usk|Usk]], [[River Wye|Wye]] and the Severn estuary. It was centred at different times on ''[[Venta Silurum|Venta]]'' ([[Caerwent]]), from which it derived its name, and ''Isca Augusta'' (Caerleon). Gwent generally allied with, and at various times was joined with, the smaller Welsh kingdom of [[Ergyng]], centred in present-day southern Herefordshire west of the Wye (and deriving its name from the Roman town of ''[[Ariconium]]''); and the larger kingdom of [[Glywysing]] in modern [[Glamorgan]]. The name Glywysing may indicate that it was founded by a British native of ''[[Glevum]]'' ([[Gloucester]]).\n\n[[File:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|250px|left|Peoples of southern Britain, circa 600 AD]]\n\nThe [[Battle of Mons Badonicus]], circa 500, could have been fought near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] between the British, the victors, and Anglo-Saxons attempting to reach the Severn estuary, but its date and location are very uncertain and it may equally well have taken place in [[Somerset]] or [[Dorset]]. However, it is more certain that the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Wessex]] emerged in the 6th and 7th centuries in the upper [[Thames]] valley, [[Cotswolds]] and [[Hampshire]] areas. In 577, the [[Battle of Deorham]] in the southern Cotswolds was won by the Anglo-Saxons, and led to Wessex extending its control to the Severn estuary and the cities of Gloucester, [[Cirencester]], and Bath. This severed the land link between the Britons of Wales and [[Dumnonia|those of the south west peninsula]]. By about 600, however, the area of modern Gloucestershire east of the Severn, as well as most of [[Worcestershire]], was controlled by another group, the [[Hwicce]], who may have arisen from intermarriage between Anglo-Saxon and British leading families, possibly the successors to the pre-Roman [[Dobunni]]. The Hwicce came increasingly under Mercian hegemony.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Chester]] in 616, the forces of Powys and other allied Brythonic kingdoms were defeated by the [[Northumbria]]ns under [[\u00c6thelfrith of Northumbria|\u00c6thelfrith]]. This divided the Britons of Wales from those in [[Northern England]], including [[Lancashire]], Cumbria, and [[Southern Uplands|south west Scotland]], an area which became known as ''\"Yr [[Hen Ogledd]]\"'' or \"the Old North\". Within a few decades, the Welsh became engaged in further defensive warfare against the increasingly powerful kingdom of [[Mercia]], based at [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] in what became the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] of England. The capital of Powys, [[Pengwern]], at or near modern Shrewsbury, was conquered by [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] in 656 when he had become overlord of the Mercians. Powys then withdrew from the lowland areas now in southern [[Cheshire]], Shropshire and [[Herefordshire]], which became known to Welsh poets as \"The Paradise of Powys\".<ref name=davies/> The areas were occupied by Anglo-Saxon groups who became sub-kingdoms of Mercia, the ''Wreocens\u01e3te'' or [[Wrekinset]] in the northern part of what became [[Shropshire]], and the ''[[Magons\u00e6te]]'' in the southern part.<ref name=rowley/> Further south, the area north west of the Severn later known as the [[Forest of Dean]] seems to have remained in British (that is, Welsh) hands until about 760.<ref>{{cite book |title= Forest Story|last= Mansfield|first= R.J.|year= 1964}}</ref>\n\n=== Offa's Dyke ===\n[[File:Offa's Dyke near Clun.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Offa's Dyke]] near [[Clun]] in Shropshire]]\n\n{{main|Offa's Dyke}}\n\nAfter [[Ine of Wessex]] abdicated in 726, [[\u00c6thelbald of Mercia]] established Mercia's hegemony over the Anglo-Saxons south of the [[Humber]]. However, campaigns by Powys against Mercia led to the building of [[Wat's Dyke]], an earthwork boundary extending from the [[River Severn|Severn]] valley near Oswestry to the Dee at [[Basingwerk]] in what became [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]], perhaps to protect recently acquired lands.<ref name=davies/> After \u00c6thelbald was killed in 757, a brief civil war in Mercia then ended in victory for his distant cousin, [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]]. As king, he rebuilt Mercia's hegemony over the southern English through military campaigns, and also caused the construction of Offa's Dyke, around the years 770 and 780.<ref name=hill>{{cite book |title= Offa's Dyke \u2013 history and guide|last= Hill|first= David|author2=Margaret Worthington|year= 2003|publisher= Tempus Publishing|isbn= 0-7524-1958-7}}</ref>\n\n[[Offa's Dyke]] is a massive linear earthwork, up to {{convert|65|ft}} wide (including its surrounding ditch) and {{convert|8|ft}} high. It is much larger and longer than Wat's Dyke, but runs roughly parallel to it. The earthwork was generally dug with the displaced soil piled into a bank on the Mercian (eastern) side, providing an open view into Wales and suggesting that it was built by Mercia to guard against attacks or raids from Powys. The late 9th-century writer [[Asser]] wrote that Offa ''\"terrified all the neighbouring kings and provinces around him, and ... had a great dyke built between Wales and Mercia from sea to sea\"''. In the mid-20th century, Sir [[Cyril Fox]] completed a major survey of the Dyke and stated that it ran from the Dee to the Severn, as Asser suggested, but with gaps, especially in the Herefordshire area, where natural barriers of strong rivers or dense forests provided sufficient defence. More recent research by David Hill and Margaret Worthington concluded that there is little evidence for the Dyke stretching \"from sea to sea\", but that the earthwork built by Offa stretched some {{convert|64|mi}} between [[Rushock Hill]] near [[Kington, Herefordshire|Kington]] in Herefordshire, and [[Treuddyn]] in Flintshire. Earthworks in the far north and south, including sections overlooking the [[Wye valley]] and east of the Wye at [[Beachley]], may in their view have been built for different purposes at different times, although their conclusions are themselves disputed.<ref name=hill/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpat.org.uk/offa/offrev.htm |title=The Final Word on Offa's Dyke?

By the 9th century, the expanding power of Mercia led to it gaining control over Ergyng and nearby [[Hereford]]. The system of [[shire]]s which was later to form the basis of local administration throughout England and eventually Wales originated in Wessex, where it became established during the 8th century. Wessex and Mercia gradually established an occasionally unstable alliance, with Wessex gaining the upper hand. According to Asser, the southern Welsh kings, including Hywel ap Rhys of Glywysing, commended themselves to [[Alfred the Great]] of Wessex in about 885. Alfred's son [[Edward the Elder]] also secured homage from the Welsh, although sporadic border unrest continued. In the early 10th century, a document known as ''The Ordinance Concerning the Dunsaete'' records procedures for dealing with disputes between the English and the Welsh, and implies that areas west of the Wye in [[Archenfield]] were still culturally Welsh. It stated that the English should only cross into the Welsh side, and vice versa, in the presence of an appointed man who had the responsibility of making sure that the foreigner was safely escorted back to the crossing point.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/htt/1256.aspx |title=The end of the Romans and the beginning of the Saxons |author=Miranda Greene |publisher=Herefordshire Council |year=2005 |accessdate=18 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103173319/http://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/htt/1256.aspx |archive-date=3 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 926, Edward's successor [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]], \"King of the English\", summoned the Welsh kings including [[Hywel Dda]] of [[Deheubarth]] to a meeting at Hereford, and according to [[William of Malmesbury]] laid down the boundary between England and Wales, particularly the disputed southern stretch where he specified that the eastern bank of the Wye should form the boundary.\n\nBy the mid-eleventh century, most of Wales had become united under the king of [[Gwynedd]], [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]]. In 1055, he marched on Hereford and sacked the city. He also seized [[Morgannwg]] and the Kingdom of Gwent, together with substantial territories east of Offa's Dyke, and raided as far as Chester and [[Leominster]].<ref name=rowley/> He claimed sovereignty over the whole of Wales, a claim recognised by the English, and historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]] states that Gruffudd was ''\"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales.\"''.<ref name=davies/> However, after his most powerful ally \u2013 Earl Elfgar of Mercia and East Anglia \u2013 died, Harold and Tostig Godwinson took advantage of the situation \u2013 Gruffudd being besieged in Snowdonia \u2013 and invaded Wales. In 1063, Gruffudd was killed by his own men. Harold returned many of the Welsh princes their lands, so that after Harold's death at the [[Battle of Hastings]], Wales was again divided without a leader to resist the Normans.\n\n=== March of Wales ===\n[[File:Chepstow Castle and Bridge from Tutshill.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[River Wye]], [[Old Wye Bridge, Chepstow|1816 road bridge]] and [[Chepstow Castle|castle]] at [[Chepstow]]. The river forms the boundary between [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]] (left) and [[Gloucestershire]], England (right)]]{{main|Welsh Marches}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Norman conquest of England]], King [[William I of England|William]] installed one of his most trusted confidants, [[William FitzOsbern]], as Earl of Hereford. By 1071 he had started the building of [[Chepstow Castle]], the first castle in Britain built of stone, near the mouth of the Wye. It served as a base from which the Normans continued to expand westward into [[south Wales]], establishing a castle at Caerleon and extinguishing the Welsh kingdom of Gwent. William also installed [[Roger de Montgomerie]] at Shrewsbury, and [[Hugh d'Avranches]] at Chester, creating a new expansionist [[Marcher lord|earldom]] in each case. In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, Norman lands are recorded west of the Wye at Chepstow and [[Caldicot, Monmouthshire|Caldicot]] in the [[Gwent Levels]] ({{lang-cy|Gwent Is-coed}}); over the whole of north east Wales as far west as the [[River Clwyd]], an area known to the Welsh as the ''[[Perfeddwlad]]''; and west of Offa's Dyke, especially in Powys where a new castle was named, after its lord, Montgomery.<ref name=davies/>\n\n[[Domesday Book]] no doubt records the extent of English penetration into Wales. This suggests that Offa's Dyke still approximately represented the boundary between England and Wales. However, during the [[The Anarchy|anarchy of Stephen]] various Welsh princes were able to occupy lands beyond it, including [[Whittington, Shropshire]] (see [[Whittington Castle]]) and [[Maelor|Maelor Saesneg]], hitherto in England. These lands were brought under English lordship by [[Henry II of England]], but became [[Marcher lord]]ships, and so part of Wales. This involved a loss of direct rule by the English crown.<ref>P. Brown, P King and P. Remfry, 'Whittington Castle: the marcher fortress of the Fitz Warin family' ''Shropshire Archaeology and History'' LXXIX (2004), 106\u20138.</ref>\n\nOver the next four centuries, Norman lords established mostly small lordships, at times numbering over 150, between the Dee and Severn and further west. The precise dates and means of formation of the lordships varied, as did their size. Hundreds of small castles, mostly of the [[motte and bailey]] type, were built in the border area in the 12th and 13th centuries, predominantly by Norman lords as assertions of power as well as defences against Welsh raiders and rebels. Many new towns were established across the area, some such as Chepstow, [[Monmouth]], [[Ludlow]] and [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] becoming successful trading centres, and these tended to be a focus of English settlement. However, the Welsh continued to attack English soil and supported rebellions against the Normans.<ref name=davies/><ref name=rowley/>\n\n[[File:CymruLlywelyn.PNG|left|thumb|230px|Wales {{circa|1217}}. Yellow: areas directly ruled by [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]]; Grey: areas ruled by Llywelyn's vassals. Both the [[Kingdom of England]], and also Anglo-Norman marcher lordships in Wales, are shown in green.]]\n\nThe [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], or ''Marchia Wallia'', were to a greater or lesser extent independent of both the English monarchy and the [[Principality of Wales]], which remained based in Gwynedd in the north west of the country. By the early 12th century, they covered the areas which would later become [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and much of [[Flintshire]], Montgomeryshire, [[Radnorshire]], Brecknockshire, [[Glamorgan]], Carmarthenshire and [[Pembrokeshire]]. Some of the lordships, such as Oswestry, [[Whittington Castle|Whittington]], [[Clun]], and [[Wigmore, Herefordshire|Wigmore]] had been part of England at the time of Domesday, while others such as [[Powys Wenwynwyn|the Lordship of Powys]] were Welsh principalities that passed by marriage into the hands of Norman barons. In ecclesiastical terms, the ancient [[diocese]]s of [[Bishop of Bangor|Bangor]] and [[Diocese of St Asaph|St. Asaph]] in the north, and [[Diocese of St David's|St. David's]] and [[Diocese of Llandaff|Llandaff]] in the south, collectively defined an area which included both the Principality and the March, and coincided closely with later definitions of Wales.<ref name=davies/>\n\nThe [[Principality of Wales]] ({{lang-cy|Tywysogaeth Cymru}}) covered the lands ruled by the [[Prince of Wales]] directly, and was formally founded in 1216, and later recognised by the 1218 Treaty of Worcester between [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]], [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Prince of Gwynedd]], and King [[John of England]]. Encompassing two-thirds of modern Wales, the principality operated as an effectively independent entity from the reign of Llywelyn until 1283 (though it underwent a period of contraction during the early part of the reign of [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]] in the 1240s, and again for several years from the beginning of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]]'s rule in 1246). Its independence was characterised by a separate legal jurisprudence based on the well established laws of ''[[Welsh Law|Cyfraith Hywel]]'', and by the increasingly sophisticated [[Curia Regis|court]] of the [[Aberffraw]] dynasty.<ref name=davies/>\n\nThe [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284 followed the conquest of the Principality by [[Edward I of England]]. It assumed the lands held by the Princes of Gwynedd under the title \"[[Prince of Wales]]\" as legally part of the lands of England, and established shire counties on the English model over those areas. The [[Council of Wales and the Marches|Council of Wales]], based at [[Ludlow Castle]], was also established in the 15th century to govern the area.\n\n=== Formation of \"England and Wales\" and county boundaries ===\n{{main|Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542}}\n\nHowever, the Marches remained outside the shire system, and at least nominally outside the control of the English monarchy, until the first [[Laws in Wales Act]] was introduced in 1535 under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. This, and a further Act in 1542, had the effect of annexing Wales to [[Kingdom of England|England]] and creating a single state and legal [[jurisdiction]], commonly referred to as [[England and Wales]]. The powers of the marcher lordships were abolished, and their areas formed into new counties, or amalgamated into existing ones.\n\nAt this point, the boundary between England and Wales, which has existed ever since, was effectively fixed. In the border areas, five new counties were created \u2013 Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, Brecknockshire and Monmouthshire \u2013 and Flintshire gained some additional territory. However, several of the marcher lordships were incorporated in whole or in part into English counties. The lordships of Ludlow, Clun, [[Caus Castle|Caus]] and part of Montgomery were incorporated into Shropshire; and [[Wigmore, Herefordshire|Wigmore]], [[Huntington, Herefordshire|Huntington]], [[Clifford, Herefordshire|Clifford]] and most of [[Ewyas]] were included in Herefordshire. According to John Davies:<ref name=davies/>\n\n<blockquote>Thus was created the border between Wales and England, a border which has survived until today. It did not follow the old line of Offa's Dyke nor the eastern boundary of the Welsh dioceses; it excluded districts such as Oswestry and Ewias, where the Welsh language would continue to be spoken for centuries, districts which it would not be wholly fanciful to consider as ''Cambria irredenta''. Yet, as the purpose of the statute was to incorporate Wales into England, the location of the Welsh border was irrelevant to the purposes of its framers.</blockquote>\n\nAn 1844 Act of Parliament later abolished several [[enclave]]s. One of these, [[Welsh Bicknor]], was an exclave of Monmouthshire between Gloucestershire and Herefordshire.\n\n=== Monmouthshire ===\n{{main|Monmouthshire (historic)}}\n\nAlthough Monmouthshire was included in the 16th century legislation, it was treated anomalously, with the result that its legal status as a Welsh county fell into some ambiguity and doubt until the 20th century.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/history/pages/counties_monmouth.shtml |title=Monmouthshire |publisher=BBC |date=August 2009 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> It was omitted from the second Act of Union, which established the [[Court of Great Sessions in Wales|Court of Great Sessions]], and like English shires it was given two [[Knights of the Shire]], rather than one as elsewhere in Wales. However, in ecclesiastical terms, almost all of the county remained within the [[Diocese of Llandaff]], and most of its residents at the time spoke [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. In the late 17th century under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] it was added to the Oxford circuit of the [[Assize Court#England and Wales|English Assizes]], following which, according to the [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], it gradually \"came to be regarded as an English county\".<ref name=eb1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Monmouthshire |volume=18 |page=729}}</ref> Under that interpretation, the boundary between England and Wales passed down the [[Rhymney River|Rhymney valley]], along Monmouthshire's western borders with Brecknockshire and Glamorgan, so including [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], and other industrialised parts of what would now generally be considered to be [[South Wales]], within England.\n\nThe 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica unambiguously described the county as part of England, but noted that \"whenever an act [...] is intended to apply to [Wales] alone, then Wales is always coupled with Monmouthshire\". Some legislation and UK government decisions, such as the establishment of a \"Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire\" in 1908,<ref>{{cite web|title=National Archives: Welsh Office|url=http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/6/detail.html|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=18 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119193059/http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/6/detail.html|archivedate=19 November 2007}}</ref> referred to \"Wales and Monmouthshire\", so that it was treated as one with Wales rather than as a legal part of Wales. The county's status continued to be a matter of debate in Parliament, especially as Welsh nationalism and devolution climbed the political agenda in the 20th century. In 1921 the area was included within the [[Church in Wales]]. The [[Welsh Office]], established in 1966, included Monmouthshire within its remit, and in 1969 [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]], [[Secretary of State for Wales]], proposed to fully incorporate Monmouthshire into Wales. The issue was finally clarified in law by the [[Local Government Act 1972]],<ref name=bbc/> which provided that \"in every act passed on or after 1 April 1974, and in every instrument made on or after that date under any enactment (whether before, on or after that date) \"Wales\", subject to any alterations of boundaries...\" included \"the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport\".<ref>Local Government Act 1972 (c.70), sections 1, 20 and 269</ref> The legal boundary between England and Wales therefore passes along Monmouthshire's eastern boundaries with [[Herefordshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]], essentially along the [[River Monnow]] and [[River Wye]].\n\n==The border today==\n[[File:Severn Aerial.jpg|thumb|Looking [[southwest]] towards the [[Bristol Channel]] with England on the left and Wales on the right.
