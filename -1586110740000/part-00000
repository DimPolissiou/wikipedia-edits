RuPaul announces the first mini-challenge is to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall, akin to Season 7's first mini-challenge.\n\nFor the main challenge, the seven queens are tasked to write lyrics and provide choreography to the track, \"I'm That Bitch\". Tensions erupt between Brita, Heidi, Jackie, and Widow regarding choreography, resulting in Heidi taking charge of choreography. The queens are able to perform the routine in front of guest judge, Nicki Minaj. The runway category for the episode is \"Sparkles\".\n\nOn the main stage, four girls (Gigi Goode, Widow Von'Du, Brita, and Jackie Cox) are given high praises, despite critiques on Brita's verse not showing much of her personality and Jackie's makeup not being able to hide her beard. Crystal Methyd is given mixed reviews on her runways but praise for her verse. Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques, with the latter coming off as nervous during the performance despite the judges loving her runways and the former selling her performance but faltering on her looks. After the judges deliberate, Brita, Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd, Nicky Doll, and Heidi N Closet are all declared safe, leaving Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du to be declared as the top two of the episode.

Sakura, Dahlia Sin, Sherry Pie, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall and Aiden Zhane. For the mini challenge, each queen needs to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall.\n\nFor the maxi challenge, the queens are asked to perform in an introductory musical number inspired by [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]. The theme for the runway is tulle. \n\nDuring critiques, the queens receive mostly glowing critiques, especially Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie, albeit Rock M. Sakura receiving a mild negative critique about using fart humor and mixed reviews regarding her runway. Dahlia Sin receives negative feedback and is called out for letting her nerves get to her and for not fully showing who she truly is. After deliberations, Jan, Aiden Zhane, Rock M. Sakura, and Dahlia Sin are all declared safe, leaving Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie as the top two of the episode. After they lipsync to \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]; Jaida Essence Hall is declared the winner of the challenge.\n\nAfter the episode, the six queens meet the first seven girls of the season.\n\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Robyn]] and [[Thandie Newton]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]-inspired jazz number.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Tulle\n*'''Top Two''': Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Jaida Essence Hall</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =148\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|3}}3\n |Title           = World's Worst\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|13}}\n |ShortSummary    = The episode begins with the first seven queens meeting the last six queens in the werkroom. They kiki over what transpired during their respective weeks, resulting in the second group revealing that there have been spats between them, particularly between Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie. The first group conceals the earlier argument between Jackie Cox, Brita, Widow Von'Du, and Heidi N Closet as a sort of unity tactic against the second group.\n\nThe mini-challenge is for the two past challenge winners, Widow and Jaida, to rank their competition from their opposite weeks between \"TOPS\" (their fiercest competition) to \"BOTTOMS\" (their least intimidating competition), resulting in Widow, Jaida, Heidi, and Aiden Zhane as the team captains of the week. \n\nThe main challenge of the week is an improv challenge where the queens are grouped into fours for a talent competition called \"''World's Worst''\". The queens are grouped as follows: (1) Aiden Zhane, Sherry Pie, and Brita; (2) Heidi N Closet, Gigi Goode, and Jackie Cox; (3) Widow Von'Du, Nicky Doll, and Crystal Methyd; and (4) Jaida Essence Hall, Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, and Jan. On the runway, the category is Buttons and Bows.\n\nAfter the runway presentations are complete, Aiden Zhane, Brita, Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, Jan, Rock M. Sakura, and Widow Von'Du are all declared safe. Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given positive critiques for both their performances and runways, and Heidi is commended for stepping up her game as team captain. Meanwhile, Crystal Methyd, Dahlia Sin, and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques for their performances in the challenge, while Nicky receives high accolades for her runway with both Crystal and Dahlia garnering mixed reviews. Ultimately, Sherry Pie is declared the winner of the challenge, while Nicky Doll and Dahlia Sin are declared the bottom two and duel to a lipsync to [[Ariana Grande]] and [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\"; Nicky wins the lip sync, eliminating Dahlia who hastily leaves the stage.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Olivia Munn]]\n*'''Alternating Judges:''' [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Queer-Peer Assessment\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Improv in a talent competition, called \"World's Worst\"\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Buttons and Bows\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/drag-race-sherry-pie-disqualification-win.html|title=Here\u2019s How RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Is Dealing With Its Sherry Pie Problem|date=March 13, 2020|first=Rebecca|last=Alter|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Bottom Two''': Dahlia Sin and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\" by [[Ariana Grande]] ft.

Gigi Goode is declared the winner and RuPaul announces that this weeks maxi challenge is a ball-themed ball (known as The Ball Ball) where the queens need to participate in three categories: Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza. The queens must make the final look from scratch having already brought looks for the other two categories. As the queens are preparing, Nicky Doll expresses her bewilderment with not being able to bring her silly side to the runway and feeling so reserved in front of the judges, despite being freely goofy and comedic in the werkroom, and vows to change that, while Rock M. Sakura tells the others about how her makeup style, resemblant of [[Kim Chi (drag queen)|Kim Chi]] and [[Trixie Mattel]], originated from racist remarks against her supposed work-ethic as a drag queen. Tensions rise when Aiden Zhane proceeds to take a nap after she finishes her final runway look far ahead of everyone else, irritating the other queens as they feel she isn't working as hard as them to push and elevate their drag in order to win the competition.\n\nOn the main stage, the girls present all of their outfits and Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll receive positive feedback from the judges on all their outfits, but Nicky is once again critiqued for presenting herself too stiff onstage and is encouraged to continue to let go and do weird things. Meanwhile, Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Rock M. Sakura are negatively critiqued by the judges. Aiden is told her Lady Baller runway is a \"home run\" but is heavily clocked by Michelle for doing nothing more than gluing balls to a corset for her Eleganza look and her last two looks being far too simple.

Sakura's elimination, with Jackie Cox and Brita emotional over Rock M.'s departure. The queens sit on the couch, discussing Gigi Goode's win, and Nicky Doll's constant criticism from the judges for being unable to show a lighthearted, comedic side of her. Aiden Zhane discusses her performance in last week's ball, defending her looks while Jaida Essence Hall admonishes Aiden for making excuses, saying that she should have been in the bottom two. The queens disperse, with Heidi N Closet and Widow Von'Du discussing Aiden's overall performance in the competition.\n\nThe next morning, the queens enter the workroom and RuPaul informs the queens that they will be acting in a ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' parody titled \"''Gay's Anatomy''\". The queens randomly select pills to decide which two queens will get to assign roles, and Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll choose the winning pills. The queens discuss which parts they want, and most of the queens end up getting the roles they requested. However, Aiden Zhane and Widow Von'Du receive different roles to their dismay. [[Carson Kressley]] directs the skit, and critiques Jaida Essence Hall for not being able to deliver her lines, Brita for inconsistent acting, and Nicky for being low energy. He gives praise to Gigi for her acting, Widow for incorporating improv into her performance, and to Aiden for following his direction. \n\nOn the main stage, with [[Normani]] as a guest judge, the queens walk the runway wearing capes. The queens see the final cut of ''Gay's Anatomy''. Aiden Zhane, Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are the best of the week, with Sherry Pie being the winner, while Brita, Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll were overshadowed. Crystal receives positive critiques for her runway and performance and is the first to be deemed safe. Jaida receives lukewarm reception for her performance, but is praised for her runway and is declared safe. Brita receives mixed reviews for her performance and is the last queen to be deemed safe. This leaves Nicky and Heidi in the bottom, as they both receive negative reviews on their runway looks and for their performance in ''Gay's Anatomy''. The two queens lipsync to \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]], Heidi N Closet is the winner, and Nicky Doll sashays away.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Normani]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Pink Pill or Silver Pill\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winners:''' Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' Assigning the roles for the main challenge\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Overact in ''Gay's Anatomy'', a parody of the popular TV show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which focuses on a group of young doctors that work in a hospital.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Planet of the Capes\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''\n*'''Bottom Two''': Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Nicky Doll</span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"I may not have gotten a crown.

Brita rehashes the drama between her and Aiden, with Aiden exhausted over Brita's attitude.\n\nFor the main challenge, RuPaul announces that the queens will be participating in the Snatch Game. He brings in [[Vanessa Vanjie Mateo]] to give tips on what to do and what not to do during Snatch Game.

Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Crystal Methyd receive negative critiques over their performances, with the latter two receiving positive feedback over their runways.\n\nGigi Goode is declared the winner of the challenge, with Aiden Zhane and Brita in the bottom two. They lip sync to the [[Frozen (musical)|Broadway version]] of \"[[Let It Go]]\" (performed by [[Caissie Levy]] as Elsa).

RuPaul announces the first mini-challenge is to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall, akin to Season 7's first mini-challenge.\n\nFor the main challenge, the seven queens are tasked to write lyrics and provide choreography to the track, \"I'm That Bitch\". Tensions erupt between Brita, Heidi, Jackie, and Widow regarding choreography, resulting in Heidi taking charge of choreography. The queens are able to perform the routine in front of guest judge, Nicki Minaj. The runway category for the episode is \"Sparkles\".\n\nOn the main stage, four girls (Gigi Goode, Widow Von'Du, Brita, and Jackie Cox) are given high praises, despite critiques on Brita's verse not showing much of her personality and Jackie's makeup not being able to hide her beard. Crystal Methyd is given mixed reviews on her runways but praise for her verse. Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques, with the latter coming off as nervous during the performance despite the judges loving her runways and the former selling her performance but faltering on her looks. After the judges deliberate, Brita, Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd, Nicky Doll, and Heidi N Closet are all declared safe, leaving Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du to be declared as the top two of the episode. They lipsync to \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]; Widow Von'Du wins the lipsync, earning the first win of the season. \n\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Nicki Minaj]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original rap verse to \"I'm That Bitch\" and choreograph a routine to be performed live on the main stage.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Sparkles\n*'''Top Two''': Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Widow Von'Du</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =147\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|2}}2\n |Title           = You Don't Know Me\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|06}}\n |ShortSummary    = At the beginning of the episode, the remaining six contestants are introduced: Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, Sherry Pie, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall and Aiden Zhane. For the mini challenge, each queen needs to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall.\n\nFor the maxi challenge, the queens are asked to perform in an introductory musical number inspired by [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]. The theme for the runway is tulle. \n\nDuring critiques, the queens receive mostly glowing critiques, especially Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie, albeit Rock M. Sakura receiving a mild negative critique about using fart humor and mixed reviews regarding her runway. Dahlia Sin receives negative feedback and is called out for letting her nerves get to her and for not fully showing who she truly is. After deliberations, Jan, Aiden Zhane, Rock M. Sakura, and Dahlia Sin are all declared safe, leaving Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie as the top two of the episode. After they lipsync to \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]; Jaida Essence Hall is declared the winner of the challenge.\n\nAfter the episode, the six queens meet the first seven girls of the season.\n\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Robyn]] and [[Thandie Newton]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]-inspired jazz number.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Tulle\n*'''Top Two''': Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Jaida Essence Hall</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =148\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|3}}3\n |Title           = World's Worst\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|13}}\n |ShortSummary    = The episode begins with the first seven queens meeting the last six queens in the werkroom. They kiki over what transpired during their respective weeks, resulting in the second group revealing that there have been spats between them, particularly between Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie. The first group conceals the earlier argument between Jackie Cox, Brita, Widow Von'Du, and Heidi N Closet as a sort of unity tactic against the second group.\n\nThe mini-challenge is for the two past challenge winners, Widow and Jaida, to rank their competition from their opposite weeks between \"TOPS\" (their fiercest competition) to \"BOTTOMS\" (their least intimidating competition), resulting in Widow, Jaida, Heidi, and Aiden Zhane as the team captains of the week. \n\nThe main challenge of the week is an improv challenge where the queens are grouped into fours for a talent competition called \"''World's Worst''\". The queens are grouped as follows: (1) Aiden Zhane, Sherry Pie, and Brita; (2) Heidi N Closet, Gigi Goode, and Jackie Cox; (3) Widow Von'Du, Nicky Doll, and Crystal Methyd; and (4) Jaida Essence Hall, Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, and Jan. On the runway, the category is Buttons and Bows.\n\nAfter the runway presentations are complete, Aiden Zhane, Brita, Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, Jan, Rock M. Sakura, and Widow Von'Du are all declared safe. Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given positive critiques for both their performances and runways, and Heidi is commended for stepping up her game as team captain. Meanwhile, Crystal Methyd, Dahlia Sin, and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques for their performances in the challenge, while Nicky receives high accolades for her runway with both Crystal and Dahlia garnering mixed reviews. Ultimately, Sherry Pie is declared the winner of the challenge, while Nicky Doll and Dahlia Sin are declared the bottom two and duel to a lipsync to [[Ariana Grande]] and [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\"; Nicky wins the lip sync, eliminating Dahlia who hastily leaves the stage.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Olivia Munn]]\n*'''Alternating Judges:''' [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Queer-Peer Assessment\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Improv in a talent competition, called \"World's Worst\"\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Buttons and Bows\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/drag-race-sherry-pie-disqualification-win.html|title=Here\u2019s How RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Is Dealing With Its Sherry Pie Problem|date=March 13, 2020|first=Rebecca|last=Alter|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Bottom Two''': Dahlia Sin and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\" by [[Ariana Grande]] ft.

Gigi Goode is declared the winner and RuPaul announces that this weeks maxi challenge is a ball-themed ball (known as The Ball Ball) where the queens need to participate in three categories: Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza. The queens must make the final look from scratch having already brought looks for the other two categories. As the queens are preparing, Nicky Doll expresses her bewilderment with not being able to bring her silly side to the runway and feeling so reserved in front of the judges, despite being freely goofy and comedic in the werkroom, and vows to change that, while Rock M. Sakura tells the others about how her makeup style, resemblant of [[Kim Chi (drag queen)|Kim Chi]] and [[Trixie Mattel]], originated from racist remarks against her supposed work-ethic as a drag queen. Tensions rise when Aiden Zhane proceeds to take a nap after she finishes her final runway look far ahead of everyone else, irritating the other queens as they feel she isn't working as hard as them to push and elevate their drag in order to win the competition.\n\nOn the main stage, the girls present all of their outfits and Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll receive positive feedback from the judges on all their outfits, but Nicky is once again critiqued for presenting herself too stiff onstage and is encouraged to continue to let go and do weird things. Meanwhile, Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Rock M. Sakura are negatively critiqued by the judges. Aiden is told her Lady Baller runway is a \"home run\" but is heavily clocked by Michelle for doing nothing more than gluing balls to a corset for her Eleganza look and her last two looks being far too simple. Rock M. meanwhile is praised for her creativity but is critiqued for doing too much particularly on her Eleganza runway and not editing her aesthetic, and Brita receives overall mediocre feedback, particularly for her Balls to the Wall creation. After the judges deliberate, Gigi Goode is announced as the winner of the challenge, while Brita and Rock M. Sakura face off in a lip sync to \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\" by [[Rihanna]]. Brita is the winner of the lip sync and Rock M. is eliminated from the competition.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' \"The Beehive Jive\" dance competition\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' A $2,500 cash tip\n*'''Main Challenge:'''  Create three looks based on Sports Balls; Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip \n*'''Bottom Two''': Brita and Rock M.

Sakura's elimination, with Jackie Cox and Brita emotional over Rock M.'s departure. The queens sit on the couch, discussing Gigi Goode's win, and Nicky Doll's constant criticism from the judges for being unable to show a lighthearted, comedic side of her. Aiden Zhane discusses her performance in last week's ball, defending her looks while Jaida Essence Hall admonishes Aiden for making excuses, saying that she should have been in the bottom two. The queens disperse, with Heidi N Closet and Widow Von'Du discussing Aiden's overall performance in the competition.\n\nThe next morning, the queens enter the workroom and RuPaul informs the queens that they will be acting in a ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' parody titled \"''Gay's Anatomy''\". The queens randomly select pills to decide which two queens will get to assign roles, and Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll choose the winning pills. The queens discuss which parts they want, and most of the queens end up getting the roles they requested. However, Aiden Zhane and Widow Von'Du receive different roles to their dismay. [[Carson Kressley]] directs the skit, and critiques Jaida Essence Hall for not being able to deliver her lines, Brita for inconsistent acting, and Nicky for being low energy. He gives praise to Gigi for her acting, Widow for incorporating improv into her performance, and to Aiden for following his direction. \n\nOn the main stage, with [[Normani]] as a guest judge, the queens walk the runway wearing capes. The queens see the final cut of ''Gay's Anatomy''. Aiden Zhane, Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are the best of the week, with Sherry Pie being the winner, while Brita, Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll were overshadowed. Crystal receives positive critiques for her runway and performance and is the first to be deemed safe. Jaida receives lukewarm reception for her performance, but is praised for her runway and is declared safe. Brita receives mixed reviews for her performance and is the last queen to be deemed safe. This leaves Nicky and Heidi in the bottom, as they both receive negative reviews on their runway looks and for their performance in ''Gay's Anatomy''. The two queens lipsync to \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]], Heidi N Closet is the winner, and Nicky Doll sashays away.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Normani]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Pink Pill or Silver Pill\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winners:''' Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' Assigning the roles for the main challenge\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Overact in ''Gay's Anatomy'', a parody of the popular TV show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which focuses on a group of young doctors that work in a hospital.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Planet of the Capes\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''\n*'''Bottom Two''': Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Nicky Doll</span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"I may not have gotten a crown.

Brita rehashes the drama between her and Aiden, with Aiden exhausted over Brita's attitude.\n\nFor the main challenge, RuPaul announces that the queens will be participating in the Snatch Game. He brings in [[Vanessa Vanjie Mateo]] to give tips on what to do and what not to do during Snatch Game. The Snatch Game characters are as followed:<br>\nAiden Zhane as [[Patricia Quinn]];<br>\nBrita as [[Jennifer Holliday]];<br>\nCrystal Methyd as [[Poppy (entertainer)|Poppy]];<br>\nGigi Goode as \"[[Sophia (robot)|Maria the Robot]]\";<br>\nHeidi N Closet as [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]];<br>\nJackie Cox as [[Lisa Rinna]];<br>\nJan as [[Bernadette Peters]];<br>\nJaida Essence Hall as [[Cardi B]];<br>\nSherry Pie as [[Katharine Hepburn]];<br>\nWidow Von'Du as [[Tina Turner]] and [[Ike Turner]].<br>\n\nFor the runway, the category is Frozen Eleganza, inspired by the [[Frozen (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]].

His intention was very clear that he loved Arjuna but didn't ill-treat anyone. He ordered Ashwatthama to gather all of his students and assemble at a nearby lake that evening. They did as per Drona's instructions. When they reached the lake, Drona was taking a bath; suddenly a crocodile appeared and attacked Drona. Nobody except Arjuna dared to enter the lake. Arjuna jumped into the lake and began to attack the mighty crocodile with his bare hands. Suddenly the crocodile disappeared. Drona told everyone that the crocodile was just an illusion and was created by himself to test all the princes and Ashwatthama. Drona also scolded the rest for not taking the initiative to save their teacher.

According to Mahabharata, Arjuna was the incarnation of Lord Nara who was the best friend of [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] and along with Nara, Lord Vishnu defeated all the demons after the churning of Ocean Samudra Manthan. According to Lord Shiva, Nara and Lord Vishnu holds the whole universe and incarnates in every Yuga to end the evil and establish righteousness. The love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna is evident from Adi Parva where after the fight in Khandava forest instead of asking any weapon or power Lord Krishna asked Indra that his friendship with Arjuna will remain forever when the latter asked Lord Krishna to ask for a boon. Lord Krishna also described his love for Arjuna in Vana Parva by saying that whoever will hate Arjuna will hate Lord Krishna and whoever will follow Arjuna will follow Lord Krishna. He even said that nobody in the whole world is dearer to him than Arjuna and he can sacrifice anything including his sons, wives and citizens just for the sake of Arjuna. During his final conversation with his father Vasudeva he told him that he wants Arjuna to perform his last rights and also said that Lord Krishna is Arjuna and Arjuna is Lord Krishna. Such was the greatness of Arjuna that the supreme god Lord Krishna was ready to sacrifice anything for him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03012.htm|title=Love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Burning of Khandava Vana==\nThe story, this was the first time Arjuna meets [[Krishna]]. In any case, [[Khandavaprastha]] was where Arjuna and Krishna's friendship is truly forged. Once when roaming in the Khandava Vana, Arjuna and Krishna met the god of fire, [[Agni]]. Agni was in great hunger and needed to burn down the entire Khandava Vana to quench his hunger. But [[Takshaka]], the serpent-king lived in the same forest and was a friend of [[Indra]]'s. So the latter brought down heavy rains to thwart Agni's plans to burn the woods. Agni requested Krishna and Arjuna to help him realise his goal.<ref name=\"autogenerated518\">{{cite book|title=Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa.|year=2008|publisher=The Echo Library|location=Teddington, Middlesex|isbn=9781406870459|pages=518\u2013520}}</ref>\n\nArjuna asked Agni for Gandiva as normal bows were not capable to bear the strength of his arms. The three of them then invoked [[Varuna]], the [[God]] of the [[oceans]]. Varuna blessed Arjuna with the [[Gandiva]] \u2013 the bow created by [[Brahma]]. In this way, Arjuna came into possession of his famous bow. Agni also gave Arjuna an incandescent chariot with four pure white horses yoked, and bearing a flag that would one-day be occupied by celestial apes of Vishvakarma. Arjuna also obtained his famous conch [[Devadatta (disambiguation)|Devadatta]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/17480/what-are-the-names-of-conch-shell-shankh-used-by-the-warriors-in-mahabharata|title=What are the names of conch shell ( shankh ) used by the warriors in Mahabharata?|website=Hinduism Stack Exchange|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref> and Krishna obtained his [[Sudarshana Chakra]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindujagruti.org/hinduism/knowledge/article/how-did-lord-krushna-acquire-sudarshan-chakra.html|title=How did Shri Krishna acquire Sudarshan Chakra ?|website=Hindu Janajagruti Samiti|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref> Arjuna, directed by Krishna, waged a successful battle against Indra and helped Agni burn down the entire Khandava Vana.

At last all gods, demons and snakes got defeated by Arjuna at this Khandava war.\n\n===Saving Mayasura===\n[[File:Krishna orders Mayasura to build a palace for the Pandavas.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Sri Krishna tells Mayasura to build a palace.]]In their demolition of Khandava, Krishna and Arjuna had saved one demon, [[Mayasura]] to build their palace.<ref name=\"autogenerated518\"/> Thus owing Arjuna a favour, and after being so directed by Krishna, Mayasura said that he would build a palace for [[Yudhishtra]]. As Mayasura was a great architect of the [[Asuras]], he soon constructed the Maya assembly hall \u2013 a gigantic palace for the Pandavas, filled with ancient books, artefacts, and jewels.

Despite of understanding of all and being forgiven by both Yudhishthira and Draupadi; Arjuna accepted the punishment, agreed with Narada and set off on a twelve - year [[pilgrimage|tirtha-yatra]]. According to Narada, Arjuna must retire to forest and pass his days as Brahmacharin. So Arjuna retired to forest for 12 years.\n\n===Ulupi at Nagaloka===\nOne day, Arjuna was taking bath in nearby Ganga river flow. Suddenly a current in the river pulled down Arjuna. He fell through regions and reached a place. As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw a beautiful woman standing in front of him. The woman introduced herself as [[Ulupi]]-the princess of Nagaloka. She also told Arjuna that the current was created by her in order to drag Arjuna to her land because she loved Arjuna very much as Arjuna was the greatest archer and an extremely handsome person. Arjuna explained his situation. Ulupi told him that she knew everything. Soon Ulupi married Arjuna and he set-out to finish his pilgrimage. A son, namely [[Iravan]] was produced as the union of Arjuna and Ulupi.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://hindumythologyforgennext.blogspot.com/2012/05/arjuna-and-uloopi-part-1-of-2.html | title=Stories from Hindu Mythology: Arjuna and Uloopi - Part 1 of 3| date=16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Chitr\u0101ngad\u0101 at Manipura===\nArjuna visited other Tirthas in [[India]], including [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalinga]] and the ashrams of the [[Saptarishi]]s, [[Agastya]], [[Vasishta]] and [[Bhrigu]]. He reached the palace of [[Manipur]]. Here, he met King Chitravahana's daughter, [[Chitr\u0101ngad\u0101|Chitrangada]]. After seeing the beauty of Chitrangada, Arjuna fell in love with her, hence he asked that the king let them marry. The king accepted Arjuna's proposal because Arjuna was extremely handsome, intelligent and attractive. According to customs of Manipura, the son of the princess would become the King of Manipura. It was mutual benefit for Arjuna and Chitrangada since [[Draupadi]] didn't want other woman equal to queen in [[Indraprastha]]. Soon, a son was born to them namely Babruvahana.\n\n===Meeting Hanuman===\nArjuna, after covering various shrines, arrived at Rameshwaram in the south. An age ago, [[Rama]] had established a Shivalinga here, seeking the blessings of Shiva before commencing his journey to Lanka to rescue his wife [[Sita]]. His army of monkeys and bears had constructed a bridge of stones and trees across the vast ocean. Arjuna gazed at the remains of this bridge that had survived. A thought struck him and he wondered aloud, \"Why did a great archer like Rama have to rely on creatures like monkeys and bears to build a bridge? Why couldn't he have instead bridged the distance with arrows?\" His fellow pilgrims shook their heads, clearly at a loss for an answer. Then, a small monkey who had been following the company for quite some distance replied Arjuna that Stalwarts like [[Sugreeva]], [[Nala]], [[Neela]], [[Angada]] and [[Hanuman]] adorned their ranks. No bridge of arrows could have withstood their weight. The monkey added \"Why, no bridge of arrows could even withstand my weight, puny as I am!\" Arjuna was quick to take up what he perceived as an implied challenge. \"Let us have a wager. I shall lay down a bridge of arrows. I am willing to burn myself if it fails to bear your weight.\" The monkey agreed. Arjuna, taking the aid of his famed quiver of inexhaustible arrows, laid down a bridge across the ocean. The monkey jumped onto it and no sooner had he walked ten paces, the bridge collapsed. Arjuna helped the monkey out of the water and asked for another attempt. The monkey agreed. Arjuna constructed another bridge, this time laying his arrows closer to each other, and asked the monkey to try again. The monkey set out on the bridge in the direction of the island of Lanka yet again but the bridge collapsed. Arjuna was ashamed of himself. Not wasting any more time, he prepared a fire and was about to step into it and give up his life, in accordance with the terms of the wager. When a youth held him back and stopped him. \"What were you about to do, o mighty prince?\", asked the boy, surprised. \"I was given a challenge and I failed. I do not wish to continue with this life now that I have faced such great shame\", replied Arjuna. The boy was aghast. \"But was there an adjudicator? Who was there to see if the challenger was playing fair? A contest without a judge is meaningless. Pray and construct another bridge and this time, I shall be the judge.\" Neither Arjuna, nor the monkey could refute the boy's argument and so they got ready for a third round. Infused with some confidence, Arjuna built a third bridge, using every bit of his ingenuity. \"There! Try crossing it now\", he said to the monkey. The monkey happily obliged. He walked on, but the bridge was still solid. \"He must have locked the arrows together better this time\", thought the monkey to himself. He began to jump on the bridge but it did not collapse. It stayed strong. The monkey was surprised. \"Let me take on the form I took while leaping across the ocean\", he thought and lo! He was large as a mountain now. Arjuna was awestruck when he saw that his challenger was none other than the great Hanuman himself. He bowed his head in reverence, realising that sooner or later his bridge would succumb to the strength of the great monkey. He was humbled. The bridge did not collapse. Not even under the weight of the now gigantic Hanuman. Arjuna was nonplussed. He could not comprehend what was happening. There seemed to be no logical explanation as to why the bridge hadn't broken yet. Apparently, Hanuman couldn't get things either. He began jumping on the bridge but it still wouldn't yield. All the while the boy was smiling. In a moment of enlightenment, it struck both participants of the contest that their adjudicator was not an ordinary boy. Arjuna and Hanuman fell at his feet and then [[Vishnu]] was standing before them. \"I am Rama, and I am [[Krishna]]. I protected your bridge from collapsing, Arjuna. Vanity and pride undo the best of men. Dear Hanuman, you should have known better than to humiliate Arjuna. He is one of the finest of warriors, perhaps the best of all bowmen in his times. How could you drive him into giving up his life?\" Arjuna and Hanuman sought the Lord's forgiveness and he blessed them. \"As an act of remorse, I shall stabilize and protect your chariot in the great battle that is imminent.\", said Hanuman. \"So be it. You shall be present on the banner of Arjuna's chariot when he rides out to battle in the great war of this age that is to come.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://talesfrommythology.blogspot.com/2011/03/hanuman-in-mahabharata.html |title = Hanuman in the Mahabharata}}</ref>\n\n===Reaching Dwarka and Subhadra===\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Arjuna and Subhadra.jpg|thumb|Arjuna and Subhadra,<br/>painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]]]\n\nArjuna moved to other Tirthas, including the southern regions in [[Kerala]]. Finally he reached [[Dwarka]], the place where his cousin [[Krishna]] resided. Arjuna had heard about Krishna's sister [[Subhadra]] in his childhood. Krishna, wishing to further tie their families, knew of Arjuna's visit and devised a plan to arrange their meeting. Accordingly, Arjuna disguised himself as a [[Yati]] and stayed at Krishna's palace. Arjuna was attracted to Subhadra and desired to marry her, Krishna understood Arjuna's intention and advised him to kidnap Subhadra then Arjuna kidnapped Subhadra and married with her. After this Balarama became furious upon learning of the abduction but was pacified by Vasudeva, his father, because Lord Krishna knew that whole Dwarka warriors can not defeat Arjuna alone as Arjuna was invincible and undefeatable in battle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01223.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Subhadra-harana Parva: Section CCXXII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref> The couple stayed in Dwaraka for a year, and then another year in Pushkar. However, Draupadi had made it clear that no other Pandava wife would be allowed to stay in her city, so Arjuna, as Krishna had advised, tricked Draupadi into meeting Subhadra as a milkmaid. Draupadi realised she had been tricked, but she forgave Subhadra and allowed her to stay in [[Indraprastha]]; allowing her to keep company with Arjuna in the four years when he was not with Draupadi. In due course, the union of Arjuna and Subhadra produced a son, Abhimanyu.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01223.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Subhadra-harana Parva: Section CCXXII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01224.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Haranaharana Parva: Section CCXXIII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Krishna-Arjuna war==\nGaya, a Gandharva king, while moving across the skies, spits the pan down his divine plane. It falls into the open palms of Sri [[Krishna]], offering prayers to Sun god [[Surya]]. Sri Krishna gets very angry and vows to kill him. Gaya is a great devotee of Krishna. Krishna could not take back his vow. [[Narada]] advices Gaya to approach Arjuna and first seek his assurance of protecting him, before revealing about the person set to take his life. As per Narada's advice, the king takes Arjuna's promise for his protection before revealing Krishna's vow to kill him. Arjuna, though surprised, sticks to his word to Gaya. Both Arjuna and Krishna feel very sad about the situation that each of them is going to fight against the most beloved ones. Any number of dialogues between both sides makes no dent in the situation. Intervention of [[Subhadra]], Narada, [[Rukmini]], [[Satyabhama]] and others fail resulting in direct combat.\nWar breaks-out and Krishna v/s Arjuna archery-duel starts. Both of them go into fierce fight. The weapons and astras used by both causes heavy destruction. Because Krishna had [[Sharanga]] and Arjuna had [[Gandiva]]. Both are undefeatable and none of them gets injured. Finally Krishna uses Sudarshana chakra and Arjuna uses Vaishnavastra. Lord [[Brahma]] appears before them and asks them to withdraw their respective destructive weapons to prevent disaster to the world. Krishna explained the intention behind fighting against Arjuna. Many of people including Balarama complained that Krishna was partial to Pandavas. Through this, he proved that he was not partial to any-one but to justice. Also he meant that Krishna and Arjuna were equal and the same. He meant that Pandavas were right followers of justice, Arjuna being the most sincere person and that's the reason why he loved them and especially Arjuna very much.<ref>''Gayopakhyanam'' by Chilakamarti Lakshmi Narasimham</ref>\n\n==Conquest for Rajasuya==\n[[File:Arjuna for Rajasuya Yaga.jpg|thumb|Arjuna on his way in Rajasuya Yaga]]\n[[File:PathRajasuyaArjunaDigvijaya.jpg|thumb|Possible route taken by Arjuna for the Rajasuya sacrifice]]\n\nArjuna was sent North by [[Yudhishthira]] to subjugate kingdoms for the [[Rajasuya|Rajasuya Yagya]], so that he could be crowned [[Emperor]] of [[Indraprastha]].

Later, Arjuna arranges for Uttara to become his daughter-in-law by marrying his son Abhimanyu to her. At the same time, he prevents [[Subhadra]] from marrying Abhimanyu to Balarama's daughter [[Vatsala]], as the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kurus]] find marriages between cousins [[taboo]].

A host of Kaurava warriors attack Virata, presumably to steal their cattle, but in reality, desiring to pierce the Pandavas' veil of anonymity. Full of bravado, Virata's son Uttar attempts to take on the army by himself while the rest of the Matsya army has been lured away to fight Susharma and the Trigartas. As suggested by Draupadi, Uttar takes Brihannala with him, as his charioteer. When he sees the Kaurava army, Uttar loses his nerve and attempts to flee. There, Arjuna reveals his identity and those of his brothers'. Switching places with Uttar, Arjuna takes up the Gandiva and Devadatta. Eager to defend the land that had given him refuge, Arjuna engaged the legion of Kaurava warriors.

Arjuna suggested Virata King to marry Uttara to his son Abhimanyu. Virata king was very much pleased with this offer. In some versions, it is also said that Abhimanyu and Uttara were already in love as Abhimanyu already met Uttara while he was in search of his parents who were in exile.

If Arjuna would have used any one of them, war would end within a minute but Krishna wanted most of the warriors to be dead from Pandavas' side as well.

He is distraught at the thought of having to fight with his friends and family such as his dear teacher [[Drona]] and grandsire [[Bhishma]]. Then Krishna took charge and explained the necessity and inevitability of the war to Arjuna. This conversation is a key part of the Mahabharata known as Bhagavad gita, and is considered as a holy scripture of [[Hinduism]].\n\nArjuna plays the role of the reader in the Bhagavad Gita. As Krishna dispenses the advice, Arjuna asks the questions. The Bhagavad Gita primarily takes the form of philosophical dialogue between Prince Arjuna and [[Krishna]]. It is said that Lord [[Hanuman]] on flag also witnessed this conversation.\n\n===Battles fought at Kurukshetra===\n[[File:Death of Jayadratha.jpg|thumb|350px|Killing of Jayadratha]]\n\nArjuna was a key Pandava warrior and played a huge role in the Pandava victory in the Kurukshetra war. Lord [[Hanuman]] stayed on Arjuna's chariot flag.\n\nSome of the crucial battles fought by Arjuna are as follows:\n* '''Fall of Bhishma''': According to original Mahabharat, Arjuna fairly killed [[Bhishma]] on 10th day of the Kurukshetra war. Shikhandi does not have any role in this, though as per one narrative it is Shikhandi who killed Bhishma.\n* '''Death of Bhagadatta''': On the 12th day of the war, Arjuna killed [[Bhagadatta]].\n* '''Killing of the Trigartas''': On the 17th day of the war, Arjuna killed all the Trigartas.\n* '''Death of Jayadratha''': Arjuna came to know that [[Jayadratha]] blocked the other four Pandavas, at entrance of Chakravyuha, due to which Abhimanyu entered alone and was killed unfairly by multiple Kaurava warriors on the 13th day of the war. Arjuna vowed to kill him the very next day before sunset, failing which he would kill himself by jumping in a fire. The [[Kauravas]] hid Jayadratha from Arjuna in a formation, knowing that Arjuna's death would result in a Kaurava victory. Arjuna defeated all protectors of Jaydratha including [[Karna]], [[Drona]], [[Kripa]] and [[Ashwatthama]] and killed [[Jayadratha]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07141.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 7: Drona Parva: Jayadratha-Vadha Parva: Section CXLIV|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref> Jayadratha had a boon from his father that whoever would be responsible for his head falling to the ground would have his own head blown up.

Arjuna led the armed forces which followed the horse around its random wanderings. He received the submission of many kings, either without or following an armed confrontation. He was thus instrumental in the expansion of the Pandava domains. Arjuna was the only warrior who alone conquered whole world in Mahabharat, Apart from Arjuna no one warrior ever achieved this feats. In the Ashvamedha Yagna, the horse was stopped by [[Babruvahana]]. Babruvahana defeated [[Bhima]] and killed [[Vrishaketu]] without knowing that they were his relatives and he was the son of Arjuna. Arjuna fought with Babruvahana and went on upper hand since Arjuna was invincible. Arjuna defeated Babruvahana and went to collect the horse. Babruvahana then used the divine weapon to kill Arjuna. This divine weapon would kill any person-even monstrous demons. Soon Arjuna got killed and the news reached [[Chitr\u0101ngad\u0101]]. She scolded him and revealed the truth that he was the son of Arjuna. With the help of [[Ulupi]], Arjuna's life was restored by a gem called Nagamani. Arjuna was very impressed with his son's bravery.\n\nArjuna built the [[Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple]] during his conquest in South India. Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple is one of the \"[[Divya Desams]]\", the 108 temples of [[Vishnu]] revered by the 12 poet saints, or [[Alwars]]<ref>''108 Vaishnavite Divya Desams: Divya desams in Malai Nadu and Vada Nadu''.

Arjuna was the fourth one to fall after Draupadi, Sahadeva and Nakula. When [[Bhima]] asks Yudhishthira why Arjuna isn't permitted the same, the reason given is Arjuna's over confidence in his skills. [[Draupadi]] also falls because while she claimed to love all the Pandavas equally, she had a soft spot for Arjuna. Bhima was the fifth to fall after Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva. The reason why Bhima fell is because he enjoyed the sufferings of other people. People may cause suffering sometimes, but not allowed to enjoy them.

When Karna asked about his real identity, Arjuna smiled and said that he is brahmin. Then Karna praised him by comparing him with Lord [[Vishnu]]. Arjuna threatened to kill Karna which made Karna flee from battlefield.\nWhen the brothers returned with Draupadi, Arjuna joked to his mother that he had brought [[alms]]. Dismissively, and without looking because she was preoccupied, Kunti asked him to share it with his brothers. Holding his mother's orders as a divine command, he requested his elder brother to accept Draupadi. Draupadi had to marry all five of the Pandavas. Her five sons, one from each of the Pandava brothers, are known as the [[Upapandavas]]. [[Srutakarma]] is the son of Arjuna.\n\nAt this point in the Mahabharata, the Pandavas revealed that they were alive. With both Duryodhana and Yudhishthira being [[crown prince]]s, tensions were high. Under Bhishma's advice, the kingdom is split, with the Kauravas getting [[Hastinapur]] and the Pandavas getting [[Khandavaprastha]]. Khandavaprastha, however, was an extremely underdeveloped land and had [[Fertility (soil)|infertile soil]], requiring extensive [[tillage|tilling]], so the Pandavas set to work rebuilding the land by burning thousand acre of forest. Their cousins [[Krishna]] and [[Balarama]] helped them.\n\n==Love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna==\nThe friendship bond of [[Krishna|Lord Krishna]] and Arjuna is the most celebrated bond in Hindu mythology followed by the bond of [[Rama|Lord Rama]] and [[Hanuman|Lord Hanuman]]. According to Mahabharata, Arjuna was the incarnation of Lord Nara who was the best friend of [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] and along with Nara, Lord Vishnu defeated all the demons after the churning of Ocean Samudra Manthan. According to Lord Shiva, Nara and Lord Vishnu holds the whole universe and incarnates in every Yuga to end the evil and establish righteousness. The love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna is evident from Adi Parva where after the fight in Khandava forest instead of asking any weapon or power Lord Krishna asked Indra that his friendship with Arjuna will remain forever when the latter asked Lord Krishna to ask for a boon. Lord Krishna also described his love for Arjuna in Vana Parva by saying that whoever will hate Arjuna will hate Lord Krishna and whoever will follow Arjuna will follow Lord Krishna. He even said that nobody in the whole world is dearer to him than Arjuna and he can sacrifice anything including his sons, wives and citizens just for the sake of Arjuna. During his final conversation with his father Vasudeva he told him that he wants Arjuna to perform his last rights and also said that Lord Krishna is Arjuna and Arjuna is Lord Krishna. Such was the greatness of Arjuna that the supreme god Lord Krishna was ready to sacrifice anything for him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03012.htm|title=Love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Burning of Khandava Vana==\nThe story, this was the first time Arjuna meets [[Krishna]]. In any case, [[Khandavaprastha]] was where Arjuna and Krishna's friendship is truly forged. Once when roaming in the Khandava Vana, Arjuna and Krishna met the god of fire, [[Agni]]. Agni was in great hunger and needed to burn down the entire Khandava Vana to quench his hunger. But [[Takshaka]], the serpent-king lived in the same forest and was a friend of [[Indra]]'s.

As Mayasura was a great architect of the [[Asuras]], he soon constructed the Maya assembly hall \u2013 a gigantic palace for the Pandavas, filled with ancient books, artefacts, and jewels. This hall was famous for visual illusions. Thus, [[Khandavaprastha]] was renamed [[Indraprastha]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Verma|first=retold by Virendra|title=The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata : (the great epic of ancient India)|year=1989|publisher=Pitambar Pub.

Despite of understanding of all and being forgiven by both Yudhishthira and Draupadi; Arjuna accepted the punishment, agreed with Narada and set off on a twelve - year [[pilgrimage|tirtha-yatra]]. According to Narada, Arjuna must retire to forest and pass his days as Brahmacharin. So Arjuna retired to forest for 12 years.\n\n===Ulupi at Nagaloka===\nOne day, Arjuna was taking bath in nearby Ganga river flow. Suddenly a current in the river pulled down Arjuna. He fell through regions and reached a place. As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw a beautiful woman standing in front of him. The woman introduced herself as [[Ulupi]]-the princess of Nagaloka. She also told Arjuna that the current was created by her in order to drag Arjuna to her land because she loved Arjuna very much as Arjuna was the greatest archer and an extremely handsome person. Arjuna explained his situation. Ulupi told him that she knew everything. Soon Ulupi married Arjuna and he set-out to finish his pilgrimage. A son, namely [[Iravan]] was produced as the union of Arjuna and Ulupi.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://hindumythologyforgennext.blogspot.com/2012/05/arjuna-and-uloopi-part-1-of-2.html | title=Stories from Hindu Mythology: Arjuna and Uloopi - Part 1 of 3| date=16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Chitr\u0101ngad\u0101 at Manipura===\nArjuna visited other Tirthas in [[India]], including [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalinga]] and the ashrams of the [[Saptarishi]]s, [[Agastya]], [[Vasishta]] and [[Bhrigu]]. He reached the palace of [[Manipur]]. Here, he met King Chitravahana's daughter, [[Chitr\u0101ngad\u0101|Chitrangada]]. After seeing the beauty of Chitrangada, Arjuna fell in love with her, hence he asked that the king let them marry. The king accepted Arjuna's proposal because Arjuna was extremely handsome, intelligent and attractive. According to customs of Manipura, the son of the princess would become the King of Manipura. It was mutual benefit for Arjuna and Chitrangada since [[Draupadi]] didn't want other woman equal to queen in [[Indraprastha]]. Soon, a son was born to them namely Babruvahana.\n\n===Meeting Hanuman===\nArjuna, after covering various shrines, arrived at Rameshwaram in the south. An age ago, [[Rama]] had established a Shivalinga here, seeking the blessings of Shiva before commencing his journey to Lanka to rescue his wife [[Sita]]. His army of monkeys and bears had constructed a bridge of stones and trees across the vast ocean. Arjuna gazed at the remains of this bridge that had survived. A thought struck him and he wondered aloud, \"Why did a great archer like Rama have to rely on creatures like monkeys and bears to build a bridge? Why couldn't he have instead bridged the distance with arrows?\" His fellow pilgrims shook their heads, clearly at a loss for an answer. Then, a small monkey who had been following the company for quite some distance replied Arjuna that Stalwarts like [[Sugreeva]], [[Nala]], [[Neela]], [[Angada]] and [[Hanuman]] adorned their ranks. No bridge of arrows could have withstood their weight. The monkey added \"Why, no bridge of arrows could even withstand my weight, puny as I am!\" Arjuna was quick to take up what he perceived as an implied challenge. \"Let us have a wager. I shall lay down a bridge of arrows. I am willing to burn myself if it fails to bear your weight.\" The monkey agreed. Arjuna, taking the aid of his famed quiver of inexhaustible arrows, laid down a bridge across the ocean. The monkey jumped onto it and no sooner had he walked ten paces, the bridge collapsed. Arjuna helped the monkey out of the water and asked for another attempt. The monkey agreed. Arjuna constructed another bridge, this time laying his arrows closer to each other, and asked the monkey to try again. The monkey set out on the bridge in the direction of the island of Lanka yet again but the bridge collapsed. Arjuna was ashamed of himself. Not wasting any more time, he prepared a fire and was about to step into it and give up his life, in accordance with the terms of the wager. When a youth held him back and stopped him. \"What were you about to do, o mighty prince?\", asked the boy, surprised. \"I was given a challenge and I failed. I do not wish to continue with this life now that I have faced such great shame\", replied Arjuna. The boy was aghast. \"But was there an adjudicator? Who was there to see if the challenger was playing fair? A contest without a judge is meaningless. Pray and construct another bridge and this time, I shall be the judge.\" Neither Arjuna, nor the monkey could refute the boy's argument and so they got ready for a third round. Infused with some confidence, Arjuna built a third bridge, using every bit of his ingenuity. \"There! Try crossing it now\", he said to the monkey. The monkey happily obliged. He walked on, but the bridge was still solid. \"He must have locked the arrows together better this time\", thought the monkey to himself. He began to jump on the bridge but it did not collapse. It stayed strong. The monkey was surprised. \"Let me take on the form I took while leaping across the ocean\", he thought and lo! He was large as a mountain now. Arjuna was awestruck when he saw that his challenger was none other than the great Hanuman himself. He bowed his head in reverence, realising that sooner or later his bridge would succumb to the strength of the great monkey. He was humbled. The bridge did not collapse. Not even under the weight of the now gigantic Hanuman. Arjuna was nonplussed. He could not comprehend what was happening. There seemed to be no logical explanation as to why the bridge hadn't broken yet. Apparently, Hanuman couldn't get things either. He began jumping on the bridge but it still wouldn't yield. All the while the boy was smiling. In a moment of enlightenment, it struck both participants of the contest that their adjudicator was not an ordinary boy. Arjuna and Hanuman fell at his feet and then [[Vishnu]] was standing before them. \"I am Rama, and I am [[Krishna]]. I protected your bridge from collapsing, Arjuna. Vanity and pride undo the best of men. Dear Hanuman, you should have known better than to humiliate Arjuna. He is one of the finest of warriors, perhaps the best of all bowmen in his times. How could you drive him into giving up his life?\" Arjuna and Hanuman sought the Lord's forgiveness and he blessed them. \"As an act of remorse, I shall stabilize and protect your chariot in the great battle that is imminent.\", said Hanuman. \"So be it. You shall be present on the banner of Arjuna's chariot when he rides out to battle in the great war of this age that is to come.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://talesfrommythology.blogspot.com/2011/03/hanuman-in-mahabharata.html |title = Hanuman in the Mahabharata}}</ref>\n\n===Reaching Dwarka and Subhadra===\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Arjuna and Subhadra.jpg|thumb|Arjuna and Subhadra,<br/>painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]]]\n\nArjuna moved to other Tirthas, including the southern regions in [[Kerala]]. Finally he reached [[Dwarka]], the place where his cousin [[Krishna]] resided. Arjuna had heard about Krishna's sister [[Subhadra]] in his childhood. Krishna, wishing to further tie their families, knew of Arjuna's visit and devised a plan to arrange their meeting. Accordingly, Arjuna disguised himself as a [[Yati]] and stayed at Krishna's palace. Arjuna was attracted to Subhadra and desired to marry her, Krishna understood Arjuna's intention and advised him to kidnap Subhadra then Arjuna kidnapped Subhadra and married with her. After this Balarama became furious upon learning of the abduction but was pacified by Vasudeva, his father, because Lord Krishna knew that whole Dwarka warriors can not defeat Arjuna alone as Arjuna was invincible and undefeatable in battle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01223.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Subhadra-harana Parva: Section CCXXII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref> The couple stayed in Dwaraka for a year, and then another year in Pushkar. However, Draupadi had made it clear that no other Pandava wife would be allowed to stay in her city, so Arjuna, as Krishna had advised, tricked Draupadi into meeting Subhadra as a milkmaid. Draupadi realised she had been tricked, but she forgave Subhadra and allowed her to stay in [[Indraprastha]]; allowing her to keep company with Arjuna in the four years when he was not with Draupadi. In due course, the union of Arjuna and Subhadra produced a son, Abhimanyu.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01223.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Subhadra-harana Parva: Section CCXXII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01224.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Haranaharana Parva: Section CCXXIII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Krishna-Arjuna war==\nGaya, a Gandharva king, while moving across the skies, spits the pan down his divine plane. It falls into the open palms of Sri [[Krishna]], offering prayers to Sun god [[Surya]]. Sri Krishna gets very angry and vows to kill him. Gaya is a great devotee of Krishna. Krishna could not take back his vow. [[Narada]] advices Gaya to approach Arjuna and first seek his assurance of protecting him, before revealing about the person set to take his life. As per Narada's advice, the king takes Arjuna's promise for his protection before revealing Krishna's vow to kill him. Arjuna, though surprised, sticks to his word to Gaya. Both Arjuna and Krishna feel very sad about the situation that each of them is going to fight against the most beloved ones. Any number of dialogues between both sides makes no dent in the situation. Intervention of [[Subhadra]], Narada, [[Rukmini]], [[Satyabhama]] and others fail resulting in direct combat.\nWar breaks-out and Krishna v/s Arjuna archery-duel starts. Both of them go into fierce fight. The weapons and astras used by both causes heavy destruction. Because Krishna had [[Sharanga]] and Arjuna had [[Gandiva]]. Both are undefeatable and none of them gets injured. Finally Krishna uses Sudarshana chakra and Arjuna uses Vaishnavastra. Lord [[Brahma]] appears before them and asks them to withdraw their respective destructive weapons to prevent disaster to the world. Krishna explained the intention behind fighting against Arjuna. Many of people including Balarama complained that Krishna was partial to Pandavas. Through this, he proved that he was not partial to any-one but to justice. Also he meant that Krishna and Arjuna were equal and the same. He meant that Pandavas were right followers of justice, Arjuna being the most sincere person and that's the reason why he loved them and especially Arjuna very much.<ref>''Gayopakhyanam'' by Chilakamarti Lakshmi Narasimham</ref>\n\n==Conquest for Rajasuya==\n[[File:Arjuna for Rajasuya Yaga.jpg|thumb|Arjuna on his way in Rajasuya Yaga]]\n[[File:PathRajasuyaArjunaDigvijaya.jpg|thumb|Possible route taken by Arjuna for the Rajasuya sacrifice]]\n\nArjuna was sent North by [[Yudhishthira]] to subjugate kingdoms for the [[Rajasuya|Rajasuya Yagya]], so that he could be crowned [[Emperor]] of [[Indraprastha]].

Later, Arjuna arranges for Uttara to become his daughter-in-law by marrying his son Abhimanyu to her. At the same time, he prevents [[Subhadra]] from marrying Abhimanyu to Balarama's daughter [[Vatsala]], as the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kurus]] find marriages between cousins [[taboo]].

A host of Kaurava warriors attack Virata, presumably to steal their cattle, but in reality, desiring to pierce the Pandavas' veil of anonymity. Full of bravado, Virata's son Uttar attempts to take on the army by himself while the rest of the Matsya army has been lured away to fight Susharma and the Trigartas. As suggested by Draupadi, Uttar takes Brihannala with him, as his charioteer. When he sees the Kaurava army, Uttar loses his nerve and attempts to flee. There, Arjuna reveals his identity and those of his brothers'. Switching places with Uttar, Arjuna takes up the Gandiva and Devadatta.

Arjuna suggested Virata King to marry Uttara to his son Abhimanyu. Virata king was very much pleased with this offer. In some versions, it is also said that Abhimanyu and Uttara were already in love as Abhimanyu already met Uttara while he was in search of his parents who were in exile.

He is distraught at the thought of having to fight with his friends and family such as his dear teacher [[Drona]] and grandsire [[Bhishma]]. Then Krishna took charge and explained the necessity and inevitability of the war to Arjuna. This conversation is a key part of the Mahabharata known as Bhagavad gita, and is considered as a holy scripture of [[Hinduism]].\n\nArjuna plays the role of the reader in the Bhagavad Gita. As Krishna dispenses the advice, Arjuna asks the questions. The Bhagavad Gita primarily takes the form of philosophical dialogue between Prince Arjuna and [[Krishna]]. It is said that Lord [[Hanuman]] on flag also witnessed this conversation.\n\n===Battles fought at Kurukshetra===\n[[File:Death of Jayadratha.jpg|thumb|350px|Killing of Jayadratha]]\n\nArjuna was a key Pandava warrior and played a huge role in the Pandava victory in the Kurukshetra war.

Shikhandi does not have any role in this, though as per one narrative it is Shikhandi who killed Bhishma.\n* '''Death of Bhagadatta''': On the 12th day of the war, Arjuna killed [[Bhagadatta]].\n* '''Killing of the Trigartas''': On the 17th day of the war, Arjuna killed all the Trigartas.\n* '''Death of Jayadratha''': Arjuna came to know that [[Jayadratha]] blocked the other four Pandavas, at entrance of Chakravyuha, due to which Abhimanyu entered alone and was killed unfairly by multiple Kaurava warriors on the 13th day of the war. Arjuna vowed to kill him the very next day before sunset, failing which he would kill himself by jumping in a fire. The [[Kauravas]] hid Jayadratha from Arjuna in a formation, knowing that Arjuna's death would result in a Kaurava victory. Arjuna defeated all protectors of Jaydratha including [[Karna]], [[Drona]], [[Kripa]] and [[Ashwatthama]] and killed [[Jayadratha]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07141.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 7: Drona Parva: Jayadratha-Vadha Parva: Section CXLIV|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref> Jayadratha had a boon from his father that whoever would be responsible for his head falling to the ground would have his own head blown up.

Arjuna led the armed forces which followed the horse around its random wanderings. He received the submission of many kings, either without or following an armed confrontation. He was thus instrumental in the expansion of the Pandava domains. Arjuna was the only warrior who alone conquered whole world in Mahabharat, Apart from Arjuna no one warrior ever achieved this feats. In the Ashvamedha Yagna, the horse was stopped by [[Babruvahana]]. Babruvahana defeated [[Bhima]] and killed [[Vrishaketu]] without knowing that they were his relatives and he was the son of Arjuna. Arjuna fought with Babruvahana and went on upper hand since Arjuna was invincible. Arjuna defeated Babruvahana and went to collect the horse. Babruvahana then used the divine weapon to kill Arjuna. This divine weapon would kill any person-even monstrous demons. Soon Arjuna got killed and the news reached [[Chitr\u0101ngad\u0101]].

Arjuna was very impressed with his son's bravery.\n\nArjuna built the [[Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple]] during his conquest in South India.

Arjuna was the fourth one to fall after Draupadi, Sahadeva and Nakula. When [[Bhima]] asks Yudhishthira why Arjuna isn't permitted the same, the reason given is Arjuna's over confidence in his skills. [[Draupadi]] also falls because while she claimed to love all the Pandavas equally, she had a soft spot for Arjuna. Bhima was the fifth to fall after Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva. The reason why Bhima fell is because he enjoyed the sufferings of other people. People may cause suffering sometimes, but not allowed to enjoy them. Nakula fell because he liked his appearance a lot instead of being royal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17002.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 17: Mahaprasthanika Parva: Section 2|work=sacred-texts.com|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Celestial Astras possessed by Arjuna==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Astra!!Deity!!Effect!!possessed by\n|-\n|[[Anjalikastra]]||[[Indra]]||Arjuna killed [[Karna]] using this astra.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs08067.htm|title=The Mahabharata in Sanskrit: Book 8: Chapter 67|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=11 January 2018}}</ref> || Arjuna, [[Lakshmana]]\n|-\n|Suryastra||[[Surya]], God of the Sun||Creates a dazzling light that would dispel any darkness about and dry up water bodies.|| Arjuna & [[Hanuman]]\n|-\n|Jyotishka Astra||[[Surya]], God of the Sun||The Jyotishka Astra could brighten a dark area.|| Arjuna & [[Hanuman]]\n|-\n|Chandrastra||[[Chandra]], God of the Moon||This Astra could intensify the brightness such that opponents fail to see the things happening around.|| Arjuna & [[Abhimanyu]]\n|-\n|Indraastra||[[Indra]], King of Gods||Would bring about a 'shower' of arrows from the sky.|| Arjuna and [[Indrajit]]\n|-\n|Bhaumastra|| [[Bh\u016bmi]], Goddess of the Earth|| The weapon could create tunnels deep into the earth and summon jewels.|| Arjuna and [[Rama]]\n|-\n|Nagapasha||The [[N\u0101ga|Nagas]]||Upon impact, this weapon would bind the target in coils of living venomous snakes. ||[[Indrajit]] & Arjuna\n|-\n|Garudastra||[[Garuda]]||A weapon that can defend against Nagaastra when attacked by the opponents.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.valmikiramayan.net/yuddha/sarga102/yuddha_102_frame.htm | title=Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda}}</ref>|| [[Rama]] & Arjuna\n|-\n|Sauparna||||The Sauparna weapon would release crazy birds.

The film follows John in his early days in [[England]] as a prodigy at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] through his musical partnership with Taupin. The film is titled after John's 1972 song \"[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]\".\n\nThe film had been in development since the 2000s before it was initially announced in 2013 where [[Focus Features]] acquired the rights to the film and director [[Michael Gracey]] and actor [[Tom Hardy]] were set to direct and star in the project respectively. After Hardy and Gracey left the project following creative differences between Focus and John that halted an initial production start in fall 2014, the project languished for several years until [[Paramount Pictures]] and New Republic Pictures took over as distributor in April 2018, where Egerton and Fletcher signed on. [[Principal photography]] began in August 2018 and was completed later that year. John served as executive producer, while husband [[David Furnish]] produced the film through their [[Rocket Pictures]], alongside [[Matthew Vaughn]]'s [[Marv Films]].\n\n''Rocketman'' premiered at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] on 16 May 2019, and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 22 May 2019 and in the United States on 31 May 2019. It grossed $195 million worldwide against its $40 million budget and received largely positive reviews from critics, with general praise for Egerton's performance, the costume design and musical numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/rocketman-first-reviews-taron-egerton-is-a-force-in-goosebump-inducing-elton-john-biopic/ |title=Rocketman First Reviews: Taron Egerton Is a Force in \"Goosebump-Inducing\" Elton John Biopic|first=Christopher|last=Campbell|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=23 July 2019}}</ref> The film was the first by a major film studio to include a gay male sex scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/rocketman-blazes-trail-as-first-major-studio-film-depict-gay-male-sex-1210947|title='Rocketman' Blazes Trail as First Major Studio Film to Depict Gay Male Sex|last=Siegel|first=Tatiana|date=16 May 2019|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=17 May 2019}}</ref> For his performance, Egerton received numerous nominations, including the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role]], and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].

Reginald is interested in music and hopes to perform for his father, Stanley, who takes no interest in his son nor his talent.\n\nReginald begins piano lessons, making his way into the [[Royal Academy of Music]]. Stanley abandons his family after Sheila has an affair. Reginald develops an interest in rock music and begins performing in local pubs. As an adult, Reginald joins the band [[Bluesology]], which is hired to play backup for touring American soul bands, [[The Isley Brothers]] and [[Labelle|Patti LaBelle and the Blue Belles]]. Isley Brothers lead singer, [[Ronald Isley|Ronald Isley,]] recommends that Reginald should write songs and put his old life behind him if he wants to become a famous artist. This inspires Reginald to change his name to Elton John. [[Elton Dean|Elton]] being the name of the saxophonist of Bluesology and John being adapted from [[The Beatles|the Beatles']] [[John Lennon]].\n\nElton begins writing music and tries finding success with [[Dick James]]' record label [[DJM Records]] under the management of [[Ray Williams (producer)|Ray Williams]]. Williams introduces Elton to lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]]; they form a friendship and move into a flat together to work on their songs. When Elton admits he is [[homosexual]], he ends his romantic relationship with their landlady, and he and Bernie are evicted.\n\nElton and Bernie move in with Elton's grandmother, his mother, and her [[significant other]], where they continue writing and create \"[[Your Song]].\" James sets up a performance for them at the [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|Troubadour]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Elton is nervous before his Troubadour debut, but the audience eagerly embraces his performance. Elton is overjoyed by his success but feels abandoned when Bernie leaves him at a party to spend time with a woman. He is approached by [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], a music manager. They sleep together and reunite later.\n\nReid's influence over Elton launches a downward spiral into a life of debauchery even as his career rises to new heights. Elton develops a flamboyant, over-the-top stage persona and becomes one of the most successful artists of the 1970s. Reid's manipulation increases into outright abuse after becoming Elton's manager. Reid insists Elton to come out to his parents as gay, so Elton reconnects with his father, who has a new family but still displays no interest in Elton. Distraught, Elton calls his mother and tells her that he is gay. She informs him that she already knew, but tells Elton that he will be forever unloved. Struggling with parental issues as well as Reid's increasing physical and emotional abuse, Elton becomes addicted to [[Alcoholism|alcohol]], [[Cocaine dependence|cocaine]], [[Cannabis use disorder|cannabis]], [[Shopping addiction|shopping]], and [[Hypersexuality|sex]] to escape his pain and loneliness, but his mood swings and short temper alienate his friends. \n\nElton catches Reid cheating on him with another man and breaks off their relationship. During a party, he binges on drugs and alcohol and [[Suicide attempt|attempts suicide]] by jumping into his pool. He is rushed to the hospital, then thrust on stage at [[Dodger Stadium]] to perform.\n\nElton descends further into a life of drugs, alcohol, and loneliness. He has a short-lived marriage with a close female friend, Renate, but his homosexuality dooms this relationship. He falls out with his mother and Bernie. Elton's dependence on prescription pills and alcohol result in a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Realizing that his life is out of control, Elton seeks help. He enters rehabilitation and realises that he no longer needs support from his parents or Reid. Elton rekindles his friendship with Bernie, who brings him new lyrics. Elton is worried that he cannot perform or compose without alcohol or drugs but writes \"[[I'm Still Standing]]\" and returns to a successful career.\n\nThe epilogue notes that Elton has been sober for over twenty-eight years, but \"still has issues with shopping.\" He remains good friends with Bernie and is married to [[David Furnish]], with whom he has two children, and is finally loved properly.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Taron Egerton]] as [[Elton John]]\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Bernie Taupin]]\n* [[Richard Madden]] as [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]]\n* [[Gemma Jones]] as Ivy, Elton's grandmother\n* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as Sheila Dwight\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as [[Dick James]]\n* [[Steven Mackintosh]] as Stanley Dwight\n* [[Tate Donovan]] as [[Doug Weston]]\n* [[Charlie Rowe]] as [[Ray Williams (producer)|Ray Williams]] \n* [[Tom Bennett (actor)|Tom Bennett]] as Fred, Sheila's boyfriend\n}}\n\nIn addition, Matthew Illesley and [[Kit Connor]] play the child and adolescent versions of Reggie Dwight, respectively.

Directed by [[Dexter Fletcher]] and written by [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]], it stars [[Taron Egerton]] as Elton John, with [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Bernie Taupin]], [[Richard Madden]] as [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], and [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as Sheila Eileen. The film follows John in his early days in [[England]] as a prodigy at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] through his musical partnership with Taupin. The film is titled after John's 1972 song \"[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]\".\n\nThe film had been in development since the 2000s before it was initially announced in 2013 where [[Focus Features]] acquired the rights to the film and director [[Michael Gracey]] and actor [[Tom Hardy]] were set to direct and star in the project respectively. After Hardy and Gracey left the project following creative differences between Focus and John that halted an initial production start in fall 2014, the project languished for several years until [[Paramount Pictures]] and New Republic Pictures took over as distributor in April 2018, where Egerton and Fletcher signed on. [[Principal photography]] began in August 2018 and was completed later that year. John served as executive producer, while husband [[David Furnish]] produced the film through their [[Rocket Pictures]], alongside [[Matthew Vaughn]]'s [[Marv Films]].\n\n''Rocketman'' premiered at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] on 16 May 2019, and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 22 May 2019 and in the United States on 31 May 2019. It grossed $195 million worldwide against its $40 million budget and received largely positive reviews from critics, with general praise for Egerton's performance, the costume design and musical numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/rocketman-first-reviews-taron-egerton-is-a-force-in-goosebump-inducing-elton-john-biopic/ |title=Rocketman First Reviews: Taron Egerton Is a Force in \"Goosebump-Inducing\" Elton John Biopic|first=Christopher|last=Campbell|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=23 July 2019}}</ref> The film was the first by a major film studio to include a gay male sex scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/rocketman-blazes-trail-as-first-major-studio-film-depict-gay-male-sex-1210947|title='Rocketman' Blazes Trail as First Major Studio Film to Depict Gay Male Sex|last=Siegel|first=Tatiana|date=16 May 2019|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=17 May 2019}}</ref> For his performance, Egerton received numerous nominations, including the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role]], and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].

Reginald is interested in music and hopes to perform for his father, Stanley, who takes no interest in his son nor his talent.\n\nReginald begins piano lessons, making his way into the [[Royal Academy of Music]]. Stanley abandons his family after Sheila has an affair. Reginald develops an interest in rock music and begins performing in local pubs. As an adult, Reginald joins the band [[Bluesology]], which is hired to play backup for touring American soul bands, [[The Isley Brothers]] and [[Labelle|Patti LaBelle and the Blue Belles]]. Isley Brothers lead singer, [[Ronald Isley|Ronald Isley,]] recommends that Reginald should write songs and put his old life behind him if he wants to become a famous artist. This inspires Reginald to change his name to Elton John. [[Elton Dean|Elton]] being the name of the saxophonist of Bluesology and John being adapted from [[The Beatles|the Beatles']] [[John Lennon]].\n\nElton begins writing music and tries finding success with [[Dick James]]' record label [[DJM Records]] under the management of [[Ray Williams (producer)|Ray Williams]]. Williams introduces Elton to lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]]; they form a friendship and move into a flat together to work on their songs. When Elton admits he is [[homosexual]], he ends his romantic relationship with their landlady, and he and Bernie are evicted.\n\nElton and Bernie move in with Elton's grandmother, his mother, and her [[significant other]], where they continue writing and create \"[[Your Song]].\" James sets up a performance for them at the [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|Troubadour]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Elton is nervous before his Troubadour debut, but the audience eagerly embraces his performance. Elton is overjoyed by his success but feels abandoned when Bernie leaves him at a party to spend time with a woman. He is approached by [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], a music manager. They sleep together and reunite later.\n\nReid's influence over Elton launches a downward spiral into a life of debauchery even as his career rises to new heights. Elton develops a flamboyant, over-the-top stage persona and becomes one of the most successful artists of the 1970s. Reid's manipulation increases into outright abuse after becoming Elton's manager. Reid insists Elton to come out to his parents as gay, so Elton reconnects with his father, who has a new family but still displays no interest in Elton. Distraught, Elton calls his mother and tells her that he is gay. She informs him that she already knew, but tells Elton that he will be forever unloved. Struggling with parental issues as well as Reid's increasing physical and emotional abuse, Elton becomes addicted to [[Alcoholism|alcohol]], [[Cocaine dependence|cocaine]], [[Cannabis use disorder|cannabis]], [[Shopping addiction|shopping]], and [[Hypersexuality|sex]] to escape his pain and loneliness, but his mood swings and short temper alienate his friends. \n\nElton catches Reid cheating on him with another man and breaks off their relationship. During a party, he binges on drugs and alcohol and [[Suicide attempt|attempts suicide]] by jumping into his pool. He is rushed to the hospital, then thrust on stage at [[Dodger Stadium]] to perform.\n\nElton descends further into a life of drugs, alcohol, and loneliness. He has a short-lived marriage with a close female friend, Renate, but his homosexuality dooms this relationship. He falls out with his mother and Bernie. Elton's dependence on prescription pills and alcohol result in a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Realizing that his life is out of control, Elton seeks help. He enters rehabilitation and realises that he no longer needs support from his parents or Reid. Elton rekindles his friendship with Bernie, who brings him new lyrics. Elton is worried that he cannot perform or compose without alcohol or drugs but writes \"[[I'm Still Standing]]\" and returns to a successful career.\n\nThe epilogue notes that Elton has been sober for over twenty-eight years, but \"still has issues with shopping.\" He remains good friends with Bernie and is married to [[David Furnish]], with whom he has two children, and is finally loved properly.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Taron Egerton]] as [[Elton John]]\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Bernie Taupin]]\n* [[Richard Madden]] as [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]]\n* [[Gemma Jones]] as Ivy, Elton's grandmother\n* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as Sheila Dwight\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as [[Dick James]]\n* [[Steven Mackintosh]] as Stanley Dwight\n* [[Tate Donovan]] as [[Doug Weston]]\n* [[Charlie Rowe]] as [[Ray Williams (producer)|Ray Williams]] \n* [[Tom Bennett (actor)|Tom Bennett]] as Fred, Sheila's boyfriend\n}}\n\nIn addition, Matthew Illesley and [[Kit Connor]] play the child and adolescent versions of Reggie Dwight, respectively.

The song was used in her 2002 movie ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'', in which Spears' character Lucy performs it in a karaoke bar. Spears said of the song, \"They asked me to sing karaoke in the movie ''Crossroads'' and I've actually sung I Love Rock 'n' Roll in a lot of clubs that I've been to.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Dingwall|first=John|title=OTR..Off the Record: Your Time Is Up, Jacko; Britney Wants Album Top Slot|newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Scotland|date=5 November 2001|page=19|url=}}</ref> Spears has publicly stated that the original song is one of her favorites. She listened to the original Arrows Mickie Most-produced version just before she recorded the song, according to [[Jive Records|Jive]] A&R representative Steve Lunt. The scratches performed on this version were performed by Corey Chase at Hit Factory Miami. When promoting the single's release, Spears mistakenly attributed the hit version of the song to [[Pat Benatar]] instead of Joan Jett.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/rock/sho-sunday-britney04.html|title=What Britney said, or should have|author=Jim DeRogatis|date=4 November 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011116135611/http://www.suntimes.com/output/rock/sho-sunday-britney04.html|archivedate=16 November 2001|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=26 February 2012|author-link=Jim DeRogatis}}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n\n====Critical====\nSpears' cover was met with mostly favorable reviews.

The song was moderately successful in the UK, where it peaked at #13 (which, at the time, was Spears' lowest peak for a single released there, until \"[[Radar (song)|Radar]]\" only managed to reach #46 in 2009, and then \"[[I Wanna Go]]\", which peaked at #111).

The video begins in [[black and white]] and switches to and from color throughout. It was shot at The Inn, a bar in Long Beach, New York. The video was ranked at #2 on the 100 Best Videos of 2002 list during [[MTV Latin America]]'s countdown. A \"Director's Cut\" version of the video was later leaked, containing previously unseen scenes.\n\nThe song was performed live during Spears' [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]] (2001\u201302). In 2016, it was added to the revamped set list of her [[Las Vegas]] residency show, [[Britney: Piece of Me]] (2016\u201317), marking the first time Spears performed the song in 14 years. During the performance, Britney Spears rode a mechanical electric guitar, which simulated a mechanical bull, as it rotated on stage. The same prop electric guitar had been used during her [[Femme Fatale Tour]] (2011) for a segment in which she covered the song \"[[Burning Up (Madonna song)|Burning Up]]\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. At the [[2016 Billboard Music Awards]], the song was performed as part of a medley.\n\n===Track listings===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*;European 2 tracks CD single\n# \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" (Album

He said, \"We were blown away by the support we received on our Christmas Number 1 single last year and how far that money has gone into changing the lives of families living in poverty across the UK. We're continually looking for ways we can support food bank charity the Trussell Trust further as the size of the problem still facing so many adults (and children) is huge and we ALL need to do whatever we can to say goodbye to poverty once and for all in the UK!

It was also the fastest-selling download since Artists for Grenfell version of \"[[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge over Troubled Water]]\" in June 2017. LadBaby became the third act to have two consecutive Christmas number one singles and the first to have two successive novelty Christmas number ones in the UK.

The song was used in her 2002 movie ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'', in which Spears' character Lucy performs it in a karaoke bar. Spears said of the song, \"They asked me to sing karaoke in the movie ''Crossroads'' and I've actually sung I Love Rock 'n' Roll in a lot of clubs that I've been to.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Dingwall|first=John|title=OTR..Off the Record: Your Time Is Up, Jacko; Britney Wants Album Top Slot|newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Scotland|date=5 November 2001|page=19|url=}}</ref> Spears has publicly stated that the original song is one of her favorites. She listened to the original Arrows Mickie Most-produced version just before she recorded the song, according to [[Jive Records|Jive]] A&R representative Steve Lunt. The scratches performed on this version were performed by Corey Chase at Hit Factory Miami. When promoting the single's release, Spears mistakenly attributed the hit version of the song to [[Pat Benatar]] instead of Joan Jett.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/rock/sho-sunday-britney04.html|title=What Britney said, or should have|author=Jim DeRogatis|date=4 November 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011116135611/http://www.suntimes.com/output/rock/sho-sunday-britney04.html|archivedate=16 November 2001|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=26 February 2012|author-link=Jim DeRogatis}}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n\n====Critical====\nSpears' cover was met with mostly favorable reviews.

The song was moderately successful in the UK, where it peaked at #13 (which, at the time, was Spears' lowest peak for a single released there, until \"[[Radar (song)|Radar]]\" only managed to reach #46 in 2009, and then \"[[I Wanna Go]]\", which peaked at #111).

The video begins in [[black and white]] and switches to and from color throughout. It was shot at The Inn, a bar in Long Beach, New York. The video was ranked at #2 on the 100 Best Videos of 2002 list during [[MTV Latin America]]'s countdown. A \"Director's Cut\" version of the video was later leaked, containing previously unseen scenes.\n\nThe song was performed live during Spears' [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]] (2001\u201302). In 2016, it was added to the revamped set list of her [[Las Vegas]] residency show, [[Britney: Piece of Me]] (2016\u201317), marking the first time Spears performed the song in 14 years. During the performance, Britney Spears rode a mechanical electric guitar, which simulated a mechanical bull, as it rotated on stage. The same prop electric guitar had been used during her [[Femme Fatale Tour]] (2011) for a segment in which she covered the song \"[[Burning Up (Madonna song)|Burning Up]]\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. At the [[2016 Billboard Music Awards]], the song was performed as part of a medley.\n\n===Track listings===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*;European 2 tracks CD single\n# \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" (Album

The single's cover is based on ''[[Abbey Road]]'''s cover. The song peaked at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\n===Background===\nIn December 2019, LadBaby announced his bid for the Official Christmas Number one. As with their last release \"[[We Built This City#LadBaby version|We Built This City]]\", all proceeds from the single went to [[The Trussell Trust]]. He said, \"We were blown away by the support we received on our Christmas Number 1 single last year and how far that money has gone into changing the lives of families living in poverty across the UK. We're continually looking for ways we can support food bank charity the Trussell Trust further as the size of the problem still facing so many adults (and children) is huge and we ALL need to do whatever we can to say goodbye to poverty once and for all in the UK! If we can use our social media presence for good by singing about sausage rolls, giving people something to smile about and helping families eat this year, then why wouldn\u2019t we. Officially, the most unanticipated single of the decade...AGAIN!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/ladbaby-announces-bid-for-2019-christmas-number-1-with-new-single-i-love-sausage-rolls__27944/|title=LadBaby announces 2019 bid for Christmas Number 1|website=officialcharts.com|date=December 9, 2019|accessdate=January 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Charts===\nOn December 20, 2019, the song song entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number one, claiming the [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|Christmas number one]] with 93,000 chart sales and with 85,000 of that total coming via downloads. It was also the fastest-selling download since Artists for Grenfell version of \"[[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge over Troubled Water]]\" in June 2017. LadBaby became the third act to have two consecutive Christmas number one singles and the first to have two successive novelty Christmas number ones in the UK. After reaching number one, LadBaby said, \"How have we done this again? It\u2019s the best feeling in the world - it's a Christmas miracle yet again! Thank you everybody for supporting us once again, and all for an amazing cause. It's going to the Trussell Trust \u2013 to the 14 million people living in poverty in the UK.
