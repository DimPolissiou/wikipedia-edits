Netanyahu hired American [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political operative [[Arthur J. Finkelstein|Arthur Finkelstein]] to run his campaign, and although the American style of sound bites and sharp attacks elicited harsh criticism, it proved effective. When Netanyahu won the [[1996 Israeli prime ministerial election|1996 election]], he became the youngest person in the history of the position and the first Israeli Prime Minister to be born in the State of Israel ([[Yitzhak Rabin]] was born in Jerusalem, under the British Mandate of Palestine, prior to the 1948 founding of the Israeli state).\n\nNetanyahu's victory over the pre-election favorite [[Shimon Peres]] surprised many. The main catalyst in the downfall of the latter was a wave of [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks|suicide bombings]] shortly before the elections; on [[Jaffa Road bus bombings#Second bombing|3]] and [[Dizengoff Center suicide bombing|4 March 1996]], Palestinians carried out two [[suicide bombing]]s, killing 32 Israelis, with Peres seemingly unable to stop the attacks. Unlike Peres, Netanyahu did not trust [[Yasser Arafat]] and conditioned any progress at the peace process on the [[Palestinian National Authority]] fulfilling its obligations \u2013 mainly fighting terrorism, and ran with the campaign slogan \"Netanyahu \u2013 making a safe peace\".

[[Hamas]] claimed responsibility for most of the bombings. As Prime Minister, Netanyahu raised many questions about many central premises of the [[Oslo Accords]]. One of his main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the [[status of Jerusalem]], and the amending of the [[Palestinian National Charter]]. Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel them to seek reconciliation when these major issues were raised in later stages.

By law, Barak's resignation was supposed to lead to elections for the prime minister position only. Netanyahu insisted that general elections should be held, claiming that otherwise it would be impossible to have a stable government. Netanyahu decided eventually not to run for the prime minister position, a move which facilitated the surprising rise to power of [[Ariel Sharon]], who at the time was considered less popular than Netanyahu.

Some pundits speculated that Sharon made the move because he deemed Netanyahu a political threat given his demonstrated effectiveness as Foreign Minister, and that by placing him in the Finance Ministry during a time of economic uncertainty, he could diminish Netanyahu's popularity. Netanyahu accepted the new appointment.

Netanyahu claimed that a bloated public sector and excessive regulations were largely responsible for stifling economic growth. His plan involved a move toward more [[Free market|liberalized markets]], although it was not without its critics. He instituted a program to end welfare dependency by requiring people to apply for jobs or training, reduced the size of the public sector, froze government spending for three years, and capped the budget deficit at 1%. The taxation system was streamlined and taxes were cut, with the top individual tax rate reduced from 64% to 44% and the corporate tax rate from 36% to 18%. A host of state assets worth billions of dollars were privatized, including banks, oil refineries, the [[El Al]] national airline, and [[Zim Integrated Shipping Services]]. The retirement ages for both men and women were raised, and currency exchange laws were further liberalized. Commercial banks were forced to spin off their long-term savings. In addition, Netanyahu attacked monopolies and cartels to increase competition. As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an 'economic miracle' by the end of his tenure.<ref name=marketwatch/><ref name=\"Likud Leaders 2015\">''Likud Leaders'', Thomas G.

A possible explanation for Likud's relatively poor showing is that some Likud supporters defected to [[Avigdor Lieberman]]'s [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] party. Netanyahu, however, claimed victory on the basis that right-wing parties won the majority of the vote, and on 20 February 2009, Netanyahu was designated by Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]] to succeed Ehud Olmert as prime minister, and began his negotiations to form a coalition government.\n\nDespite right wing parties winning a majority of 65 seats in the [[Knesset]], Netanyahu preferred a broader centrist coalition and turned to his Kadima rivals, chaired by Tzipi Livni, to join his government. This time it was Livni's turn to decline to join, with a difference of opinion on how to pursue the peace process being the stumbling block. Netanyahu did manage to entice a smaller rival, the Labour party, chaired by Ehud Barak, to join his government, giving him a certain amount of centrist tone. Netanyahu presented his cabinet for a Knesset \"Vote of Confidence\" on 31 March 2009.

Yet for terrorism to have any impact, it is precisely the lack of connection, the lack of any possible involvement or \"complicity\" of the chosen victims in the cause the terrorists seek to attack, that produces the desired fear. For terrorism's underlying message is that every member of society is \"guilty\", that anyone can be a victim, and that therefore no one is safe ... In fact, the methods reveal the totalitarian strain that runs through all terrorist groups ... It is not only that the ends of the terrorists do not succeed in justifying the means they choose; their choice of means indicate what their true ends are. Far from being fighters for freedom, terrorists are the forerunners of tyranny.

Netanyahu hired American [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] political operative [[Arthur J. Finkelstein|Arthur Finkelstein]] to run his campaign, and although the American style of sound bites and sharp attacks elicited harsh criticism, it proved effective. When Netanyahu won the [[1996 Israeli prime ministerial election|1996 election]], he became the youngest person in the history of the position and the first Israeli Prime Minister to be born in the State of Israel ([[Yitzhak Rabin]] was born in Jerusalem, under the British Mandate of Palestine, prior to the 1948 founding of the Israeli state).\n\nNetanyahu's victory over the pre-election favorite [[Shimon Peres]] surprised many. The main catalyst in the downfall of the latter was a wave of [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks|suicide bombings]] shortly before the elections; on [[Jaffa Road bus bombings#Second bombing|3]] and [[Dizengoff Center suicide bombing|4 March 1996]], Palestinians carried out two [[suicide bombing]]s, killing 32 Israelis, with Peres seemingly unable to stop the attacks. Unlike Peres, Netanyahu did not trust [[Yasser Arafat]] and conditioned any progress at the peace process on the [[Palestinian National Authority]] fulfilling its obligations \u2013 mainly fighting terrorism, and ran with the campaign slogan \"Netanyahu \u2013 making a safe peace\".

[[Hamas]] claimed responsibility for most of the bombings. As Prime Minister, Netanyahu raised many questions about many central premises of the [[Oslo Accords]]. One of his main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the [[status of Jerusalem]], and the amending of the [[Palestinian National Charter]]. Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel them to seek reconciliation when these major issues were raised in later stages.

By law, Barak's resignation was supposed to lead to elections for the prime minister position only. Netanyahu insisted that general elections should be held, claiming that otherwise it would be impossible to have a stable government. Netanyahu decided eventually not to run for the prime minister position, a move which facilitated the surprising rise to power of [[Ariel Sharon]], who at the time was considered less popular than Netanyahu.

Some pundits speculated that Sharon made the move because he deemed Netanyahu a political threat given his demonstrated effectiveness as Foreign Minister, and that by placing him in the Finance Ministry during a time of economic uncertainty, he could diminish Netanyahu's popularity. Netanyahu accepted the new appointment.

Netanyahu claimed that a bloated public sector and excessive regulations were largely responsible for stifling economic growth. His plan involved a move toward more [[Free market|liberalized markets]], although it was not without its critics. He instituted a program to end welfare dependency by requiring people to apply for jobs or training, reduced the size of the public sector, froze government spending for three years, and capped the budget deficit at 1%. The taxation system was streamlined and taxes were cut, with the top individual tax rate reduced from 64% to 44% and the corporate tax rate from 36% to 18%. A host of state assets worth billions of dollars were privatized, including banks, oil refineries, the [[El Al]] national airline, and [[Zim Integrated Shipping Services]]. The retirement ages for both men and women were raised, and currency exchange laws were further liberalized. Commercial banks were forced to spin off their long-term savings. In addition, Netanyahu attacked monopolies and cartels to increase competition. As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an 'economic miracle' by the end of his tenure.<ref name=marketwatch/><ref name=\"Likud Leaders 2015\">''Likud Leaders'', Thomas G.

A possible explanation for Likud's relatively poor showing is that some Likud supporters defected to [[Avigdor Lieberman]]'s [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] party. Netanyahu, however, claimed victory on the basis that right-wing parties won the majority of the vote, and on 20 February 2009, Netanyahu was designated by Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]] to succeed Ehud Olmert as prime minister, and began his negotiations to form a coalition government.\n\nDespite right wing parties winning a majority of 65 seats in the [[Knesset]], Netanyahu preferred a broader centrist coalition and turned to his Kadima rivals, chaired by Tzipi Livni, to join his government. This time it was Livni's turn to decline to join, with a difference of opinion on how to pursue the peace process being the stumbling block. Netanyahu did manage to entice a smaller rival, the Labour party, chaired by Ehud Barak, to join his government, giving him a certain amount of centrist tone. Netanyahu presented his cabinet for a Knesset \"Vote of Confidence\" on 31 March 2009.

Yet for terrorism to have any impact, it is precisely the lack of connection, the lack of any possible involvement or \"complicity\" of the chosen victims in the cause the terrorists seek to attack, that produces the desired fear. For terrorism's underlying message is that every member of society is \"guilty\", that anyone can be a victim, and that therefore no one is safe ... In fact, the methods reveal the totalitarian strain that runs through all terrorist groups ... It is not only that the ends of the terrorists do not succeed in justifying the means they choose; their choice of means indicate what their true ends are. Far from being fighters for freedom, terrorists are the forerunners of tyranny.

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]] and Bohemian Risk Productions, with [[Steve Lightfoot]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Jon Bernthal]] stars as Castle, alongside [[Ebon Moss-Bachrach]], [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]], [[Amber Rose Revah]], [[Daniel Webber (actor)|Daniel Webber]], [[Paul Schulze]], [[Jason R. Moore]], [[Michael Nathanson (actor)|Michael Nathanson]], [[Jaime Ray Newman]], and [[Deborah Ann Woll]]. Development on ''The Punisher'' as a spin-off from ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' began by January 2016, and it was ordered to series in April. Lightfoot was announced as executive producer and showrunner, with Bernthal and Woll reprising their roles from ''Daredevil''. Filming took place in New York City from October 2016 to April 2017. Practical effects were augmented by the visual effects department, including the addition of muzzle flashes and gore to fight scenes. The season explores [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] for military veterans, and depicts \"all sides\" of the [[Gun politics in the United States|United States gun control debate]].\n\nThe season premiered in New York City on November 6, 2017, with the full season of thirteen episodes released on November 17 on Netflix. A surprise release had been planned for October, but was cancelled following the [[Las Vegas shooting]].

Six months later, he is awakened at 3:00 every morning by nightmares of his family's deaths. Castle passes much of his time working, taking down an old building. This angers the other workers, who are denied extra pay due to Castle's overtime. He also visits Curtis Hoyle, a veteran that Castle served alongside before his family died, and mentions that his time in Afghanistan involved some activities that he did not want to discuss. A new worker, Donny Chavez, attempts to befriend Castle, and proves himself to be eager to please the other workers. He agrees to help them steal money from a local gang, but he accidentally reveals his identity to the gangsters. The others attempt to kill Chavez at the worksite, but Castle is there and kills them first. He then kills the gangsters before they can hunt Chavez.

He contacts Castle and tells him to check a disk that he had left for Castle at his old family home; the disk contains footage of Castle and his unit in [[Kandahar]], torturing and murdering Madani's partner Ahmad Zubair. Madani had that video before it was stolen, and now wants to discuss Castle\u2014who is believed to be dead\u2014with his old army friend [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Billy Russo]]. Her superior Carson Wolf forbids her from this, but she convinces him to use Russo's new business Anvil for field training, and talks to Russo then. Castle's journalist friend [[Karen Page]] agrees to help him find Micro, and learns that he is former NSA analyst [[Microchip (comics)|David Lieberman]], who was caught leaking secrets and was believed to be killed. Wolf covered up the story, so Castle tortures and kills him, learning that the death of his family was just one attempt to kill him.

Soon after, Wolf hunted Lieberman down with special forces, shooting him and framing him for a crime. The shot hit Lieberman's cellphone and he was able to go underground. Lieberman gets the upper-hand on Castle, who reveals that in Kandahar he was selected for a special unit, Cerberus, alongside Russo, and they were used by a mysterious agent to hunt down and kill high value targets. Castle had not known who Zubair was when he was ordered to kill him, and had grown increasingly disillusioned with his command. When they ignored his and Russo's advice and went ahead with a mission that killed several other members of Cerberus, Castle was able to complete the mission in an intense killing spree, but he and Russo then transferred from the unit. Now, Castle agrees to work with Lieberman to hunt down those behind Cerberus.\n |LineColor = 161719\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Punisher (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = Resupply\n |DirectedBy = [[Kari Skogland]]\n |WrittenBy = Dario Scardapane\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary = Requiring weapons and ammunition, Castle gets Lieberman to search law enforcement databases for known shipments of guns. Castle follows a lead to dealer [[Turk Barrett]], but finds that the shipment was a special delivery and does not serve their needs. Barrett says that the main shipment is going to someone else, and Lieberman soon finds that Homeland security is working on an operation to buy the shipment in hopes of arresting those selling the weapons. Madani, now acting-Special Agent in Charge, wishes to investigate Wolf's murder, but is warned against pursuing the matter by another superior, and is instead told to focus on the weapons operation. She helps coordinate the operation, the plans for which Lieberman learned by hacking into Homeland security.

The series would be centered on [[Jon Bernthal]] as [[Punisher|Frank Castle]], and was described as a stand-alone series apart from those leading up to ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' crossover event.<ref name=\"PunisherTVLine\" /><ref name=\"PunisherTHR\" /><ref name=\"SarandosJan2016\" /> That April, Netflix officially ordered a full 13 episode season of ''The Punisher'', confirmed Bernthal's involvement, and named [[Steve Lightfoot]] as executive producer and showrunner.<ref name=\"PunisherEWApr2016\" /><ref name=\"PunisherEpCount\" /> Asked whether he would rather have a 10 episode season given the longer 13 episode-seasons have been criticized for other Marvel Netflix series, Lightfoot said that he wanted the season to be a \"slow burn show\" that was character-driven, and that he felt they had the right amount of story to fill the 13 episodes.<ref name=\"LightfootColliderJul2018\" />\n\n===Writing===\nLightfoot had a loose idea of what the \"journey of Season 1\" would be when he joined the series, and this was fleshed-out and altered in the writers room throughout work on the season.<ref name=\"LightfootColliderJul2018\" /> Executive producer [[Jeph Loeb]] said the season would ask the questions \"Who is Frank? What is Frank going to do? And who's going to try and stop Frank?\"<ref name=\"RT12Questions\" /> Lightfoot chose not to adapt any specific version of the character from the comics and instead looked to the work that was done in ''Daredevil'' defining the character. That series' depiction was what got Lightfoot interested in the character, and he wanted it to dictate this series' direction. ''The Punisher'' begins with a teaser featuring Castle killing the gang members that he believes are responsible for his family's death, which is a conclusion to the character's story in ''Daredevil''. The series then jumps ahead to the character \"stuck in the past and sort of crippled by this grief\".<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" /> The season also depicts some events from before the second season of ''Daredevil'', which Bernthal described as being \"loose with chronology\";<ref name=\"SFXMagazine\" /> this includes an explanation of Castle's time serving in [[Kandahar]], which had been mentioned in ''Daredevil'' and was something that Lightfoot felt this series should address.<ref name=\"Lightfoot/FilmNov2017\" />\n\nAs a fan of [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] and 1970s [[Urban fiction|urban]] [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]], Lightfoot felt that the series should combine those ideas due to Castle's antihero persona being an archetype of Western films but set in the urban environment of New York City. Lightfoot looked to films from those genres as inspiration for tone and style, ideas, and themes for the series, and also looked to 1970s [[Conspiracy fiction|conspiracy thriller]] films due to Castle being a fugitive in the series and the general sense of paranoia. The series makes a reference to ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'' (1976), while Lightfoot described the first episode of the series as a modern \"updating\" of ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953).<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" /> Lightfoot also took inspiration from the [[Bourne (film series)|''Bourne'' film series]] and the film ''[[American Sniper]]'' (2014) for the series.<ref name=\"RT12Questions\" /> Regarding his previous television series ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'', Lightfoot stated that he learned from that series' creator [[Bryan Fuller]] to make an antihero like [[Hannibal Lecter]] relatable to the audience by finding \"something in them that's universal that we can all feel\", such as Lector being lonely. Carrying this over to ''The Punisher'', Lightfoot saw in Castle the idea of \"a man whose family was taken from him at a young age\" and that a series focused on him should be an exploration of his grief and how he responds to it. Lightfoot felt that even audience members who did not agree with Castle's actions would be able to go on a \"journey\" with the character if they understood this aspect of him.<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=\"We talked a lot as we developed the show that once you take hold of the hand of violence it's impossible to let it go. That relationship to violence really interested me, not just the fact he has the ability to use it but also the cost of it.\"|source=\u2014Showrunner Steve Lightfoot on violence in ''The Punisher''<ref name=\"SFXMagazine\" />}}\nRather than show the \"beautiful\" scenes of horror that were created for ''Hannibal'', Lightfoot wanted to follow the lead of the character's fight scenes in ''Daredevil'' by not shying away from the cost of the actual actions, feeling that showing the brutal reality of Castle's actions would better convey to the audience that \"This stuff hurts, and it's not OK\" rather than glossing over the violence which he felt would have been worse.<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" /> He elaborated that he was unsure if the series was the most violent Marvel Netflix series, as he was simply taking the level of violence he saw depicted in ''Daredevil'' as a baseline for this series, and that it is important to remember that \"a lot of what he's doing is wrong. We have to let the audience lose him at times and let him win them back. To just wholeheartedly be behind him wouldn't be right\". Despite this, Lightfoot wanted to convey the character's feelings and thoughts to help the audience understand the character, and often used flashbacks or dreams featuring his family since Castle does not talk much and having constant flashbacks also represented how he is unable to stop thinking about them.<ref name=\"Lightfoot/FilmNov2017\" />\n\nLightfoot described Castle as a metaphor for \"the fact that we\u2019ve been sending men to war for 15 years now and then bringing them back and expecting them to just fit back in. Clearly, that isn't what happens.\" Having not served in the military himself, Lightfoot spent time with the rest of the series' writers reading first-person accounts and memoirs from real-life war veterans, and the series also had consultants from the military, the Special Forces, and the CIA including one military consultant who read every script of the series and gave notes. Noting that a vocal community of United States soldiers and veterans were fans of the Punisher character, Lightfoot and Bernthal ensured that the series was always respectful of the military and law enforcement despite Castle's actions being generally criminal; Lightfoot said it was an \"interesting thing to be respectful of the police and at the same time, the character is beyond the law.\" Feeling that it was not his place to preach about the politics of vigilantism or the [[Gun politics in the United States|United States gun control debate]], Lightfoot wanted to create a \"body of characters where you feel like all sides and issues were given a voice so the audience can decide\", from a veteran who is a \"gentle group-therapy leader\" to a \"gun nut\".<ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" /> When creating an original character for the series to serve as the \"tough nemesis cop\" who is hunting Castle, Lightfoot decided to \"mix the paradigm up\" by making the character female and having her be his equal. Lightfoot noted that the writer's room, which included both men and women, had \"a lot of fun\" with this idea. They also wanted the character to be of Middle Eastern descent and be as big of a patriot as Castle and an action hero in her own right. This character became Dinah Madani. Lightfoot did not want the \"spiderweb\" of supporting characters in the series to be \"sidekicks\" to Castle, and instead have \"their own narrative and their own story that was the most important thing to them\".<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher,<ref name=\"PunisherEWApr2016\" /> [[Ebon Moss-Bachrach]] as [[Microchip (comics)|David Lieberman / Micro]],<ref name=\"MarvelOct2016\" /><ref name=\"MicroName\" /> [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] as [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Billy Russo]], [[Amber Rose Revah]] as Dinah Madani,<ref name=\"MarvelOct2016\" /> [[Daniel Webber (actor)|Daniel Webber]] as Lewis Wilson,<ref name=\"NewCastOct2016\" /><ref name=\"Wilson\" /> [[Paul Schulze]] as [[William Rawlins]], [[Jason R.

Mahome, whose father served in the military, found this to be a powerful experience and helpful for his acting in the series.<ref name=\"Mahome\" />\n\n===Design===\nStephanie Maslansky, who served as costume designer for the first seasons of ''Daredevil'', ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', and ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', had the choice between designing for ''The Defenders'' or for ''The Punisher'' due to a scheduling conflict between the two productions, and chose to work on ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"MaslanskyElite\" /> Instead, Lorraine Calvert designed the costumes for ''The Punisher'' after introducing the look of the character in the second season of ''Daredevil''; her take on the character's \"beloved\" comic-inspired costume balances the original design, Bernthal's needs as an actor and interpretation of the character, and Lightfoot's intentions for the tone of the series.<ref name=\"Calvert\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on October 3, 2016 in Brooklyn, New York,<ref name=\"PunisherFilming1\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> under the working title ''Crime''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> Locations for the production included [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]],<ref name=\"GreenpointFilming\" /> the [[Williamsburg Bridge]], [[Columbus Circle]] and [[Central Park West]], Cortlandt Alley, [[Circle Line Downtown]] cruises, the Manhattan Family Court building, [[Long Island City]], Grand Ferry Park in South [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], [[Sunnyside, Queens]], [[Pulaski Bridge]], the [[Roosevelt Island]] and its steam plant, the [[Bronx County Courthouse]], [[Newtown Creek]], [[The Roosevelt Hotel (Manhattan)|The Roosevelt Hotel]], [[Astoria Park]], [[Tudor City]], [[Hunts Point, Bronx]], the [[Forest Park Carousel]], the [[Bronx\u2013Whitestone Bridge]],<ref name=\"UntappedCities\" /> the \"[[Goodfellas|GoodFellas Diner]]\" before it was damaged in a 2018 fire and the [[Mount Zion Cemetery (New York City)|Mount Zion Cemetery]], both in [[Maspeth, Queens]],<ref name=\"GoodFellas\" /><ref name=\"UntappedCities\" /> and in [[Astoria, Queens]].<ref name=\"AstoriaFilming\" /> A car chase for the season was filmed at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] in night shoots, with Moss-Bachrach driving one of the cars.<ref name=\"Moss-BachrachRTNov2017\" /> Filming for the season [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on April 9, 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingWrap\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects supervisor Greg Anderson and vendor [[FuseFX]] returned from the first season of ''Luke Cage'' to create the visual effects for ''The Punisher'', creating 855 visual effects shots across the season. Their team changed in size for each episode, but generally consisted of 15 to 20 people.<ref name=\"FuseAX\" /> Due to the realistic tone of the series, which does not feature any superpowers, the visual effects department had to work even harder than usual to ensure their effects were believable,<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" /><ref name=\"FuseAX\" /> with a focus on creating \"gunplay, knifeplay, explosions and other real world effects.\" They preferred to augment practical effects rather than start from scratch to help with realism as well as the series' budget and schedule.<ref name=\"FuseAX\" />\n\nAs an example of the work Fuse did during fight sequences, Anderson discussed the scene where Russo and his men attack Micro's basement. Though practical prop weapons were used for the fight, Fuse had to augment the action with computer generated blood, knives, and muzzle flashes, as well as a computer generated head that is blown apart by a shotgun. The sequence was thoroughly storyboarded and pre-visualized to plan out the exact visuals required. Because the scene, like many others throughout the season, required a dark environment the visual effects team had to work with the cinematography department to decide where the low-light should be practical and where color-grading could be used to alter a more brightly-lit set given it is difficult to integrate visual effects with dark images. Conversely to this scene, a sequence such as when Russo blows up a hideout required minimal visual effects work because the explosion was shot practically, with Fuse mainly just adding some windows to the building that were removed for the explosion.<ref name=\"FuseAX\" /> \n\nThe most technically difficult scene of the season to create was in the first episode, where Castle shoots someone from across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. Anderson estimated that the scene was 90 percent digital, with the environment between Castle and his target created entirely by the visual effects department.<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" /> So that Moore could portray amputee Curtis Hoyle, Fuse had to digitally replace his leg in several shots. This involved Moore wearing a green sleeve over his leg and Fuse replacing it with a stump. The company also had to recreate the background behind Moore's actual leg which was often the most difficult part, such as when he is getting out of bed and realistic-looking digital cloth needed to match with the actual sheets that were on set.<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" /> Additionally, visual effects were used to augment cement in the sequence where people are thrown into it. The special effects department created a mixture to look like cement for use while filming the scene, but it ultimately did not look realistic on camera and had to be changed digitally.<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn April 2017, [[Tyler Bates]] was announced as the composer for ''The Punisher'', after previously composing for Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''.<ref name=\"Bates\" /> In order to \"get into the dark corners of the Punisher's mind,\" Bates played \"more of a broken blues\" guitar, which was augmented with talkbox effects and other \"guitar noises\", along with guitar-vol and melodica. On this style, Bates said, \"The rough edges and broken nature of [music like this] leaves a great deal of space for emotion and interesting color\u2014and a bit of an attitude.

The pair felt with the increased marketing of the season, it would release \"sooner rather than later\".<ref name=\"DeadlineReleaseSep2017\" /> Allison Keene of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] expressed irritation at this because she and other television journalists were unable to plan content without knowing the release date, while fans anticipating the series would watch it \"whenever it appears\" regardless of when the date is announced.<ref name=\"ColliderReleaseDate\" /> ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'}}s Susana Polo felt Marvel and Netflix would announce the date at their scheduled [[New York Comic Con]] 2017 panel in October, as the convention had been used in previous years to reveal \"breaking fall Marvel/Netflix news\".<ref name=\"PolygonReleaseDate\" /> It was soon reported that this was indeed the case, with Netflix planning a surprise \"drop\" release of the season after the New York Comic Con panel,<ref name=\"VegasShooting\" /><ref name=\"ReleaseDelayed\" /> mimicking a strategy from the music industry where an artist's album is released \"with little or no fanfare\".<ref name=\"ReleaseDelayed\" /> However, Marvel and Netflix decided to delay the release of the season to later in 2017 following the [[Las Vegas shooting]] and subsequent cancelling of the panel.<ref name=\"ReleaseDelayed\" /><ref name=\"VegasShooting\" /> Two weeks later, the November 17 release was announced.<ref name=\"NovemberRelease\" />\n\nRegarding the decisions made concerning the New York Comic Con panel and the season's release, Loeb said that they were made \"specifically because it was a week after a horrible, horrible incident. It hasn't changed the television series, the show is not predominantly about gun violence, and in fact it shows you the problems that occur in that world.\"<ref name=\"LoebOct2017\" /> Bernthal and Lightfoot felt delaying the release of the season \"was the right decision\" out of respect for the victims,<ref name=\"BernthalIndieWire\" /><ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" /> with Lightfoot saying there was no reason to go ahead with the panel if it was going to upset \"even one person involved\" with the shooting.<ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" /> Moore had initially felt the season would not be released at all once the panel was cancelled.<ref name=\"Collider30ThingsS2\" /> Between the Las Vegas shooting and subsequent delaying of the season, and the eventual November 17 release, the United States experienced another [[mass shooting]] with the [[Sutherland Springs church shooting]]. Bernthal hoped that these two shootings and the release of the season would together help further the discussion on [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]], with \"all sides of this debate\" represented in ''The Punisher''.<ref name=\"BernthalIndieWire\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nBernthal and Woll appeared at New York Comic Con in October 2016 to officially announce the start of production on the series and the latter's involvement,<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> while Bernthal presented exclusive footage from the series at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2017.<ref name=\"SDCCFootage\" /> A teaser was revealed on Netflix in August 2017 after the credits of the final episode of ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"DefendersTagTeaser\" /> Also in the month, the series' [[Twitter]] account revealed the episode titles as [[Morse code]] messages.<ref name=\"EpisodeTitles\" /> In September 2017, the series' [[Instagram]] account released viral videos made to look like security footage,<ref name=\"InstagramVideos\" /> while episodic photos and a poster for the season with a redacted release date were also released.<ref name=\"DeadlineReleaseSep2017\" /> On September 20, the official trailer for the season was released. Andrew Liptak of ''[[The Verge]]'' said it \"sets up ''The Punisher'' with its own distinct tone that's different from the other Marvel Netflix shows. It wades into government conspiracies and hacking, which is reminiscent of shows like [[CBS]]'s ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'' or [[USA Network|USA]]'s ''[[Mr. Robot]]'', but with more gunfire.\"<ref name=\"VergeTrailer\" /> [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]'s Kendall Ashley called the trailer \"intense, super bloody, and has [me] INCREDIBLY pumped for the show's premiere.\" She added that \"if this trailer is any indication, ''The Punisher'' is definitely going to live up to fan expectations\". Ashley felt the inclusion of \"[[One (Metallica song)|One]]\" by [[Metallica]] in the trailer \"helps paint Frank as a badass unlike any we've seen on the Marvel Netflix shows so far.\"<ref name=\"NerdistTrailer\" /> Cooper Hood, writing for [[Screen Rant]] felt the trailer would \"only increase the fever for\" the series despite it not yet having a release date, with it more closely fitting the \"mold\" of the character than the more cryptic videos previously released. He also found it \"well-cut\" to the beat of the song, which he praised as \"amplifying the intensity\".<ref name=\"ScreenRantTrailer\" />\n\nBy the end of September, Netflix had updated their viral website for the ''New York Bulletin'' to include a profile page for Karen Page. After revealing her login credentials in a post on ''Daredevil''{{'}}s Facebook page, readers who visited Page's profile found images referencing Page's research into Castle from the second season of ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"NYBulletinViralSite\" /> Bernthal and other members of the cast were scheduled to appear at New York Comic Con 2017 to promote the season,<ref name=\"NYCC2017\" /> but the panel was cancelled after the 2017 Las Vegas Strip shooting.<ref name=\"VegasShooting\" /> Two weeks later, a second trailer was released revealing the season's release date of November 17, 2017. Tom Philip at ''[[GQ]]'' was not very enthused with the trailer, saying it was \"hard to get super jazzed about another gritty, ultra-violent, gun-loving, non-superhero show right now.\" He was critical of the \"utilitarian-sounding writing\" in the trailer, but felt the chemistry between Bernthal and Woll would be a reason to watch the series. Philip also felt the addition of Moss-Bachrach was \"curious\", and said \"at least [the series is] a swing for the fences from a TV studio that tends to play it astoundingly safe.\"<ref name=\"GQTrailer2\" /> Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted that the gun violence sequences featured were mainly \"flashbacks with military men doing military things in full fatigues or scenes of bad guys shooting at not-so-bad guys with heavy gunfire\", which was a strong contrast to the first trailer. Mendelson felt this shift in the marketing strategy could have been in response to the Las Vegas shootings.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer2\" /> [[TechCrunch]]'s Darrell Etherington agreed with Mendelson, noting how the trailer \"plays up Castle's motivations and the more human side of the story\", while still looking \"gritty and dark, [and] Bernthal's portrayal looking as strong as ever.\" Etherington also criticized the soundtrack of the trailer.<ref name=\"TechCrunchTrailer2\" /> ''The Punisher'' had its red carpet premiere on November 6, 2017, in New York City at the [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] [[AMC Loews]] theatre.<ref name=\"Premiere\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 67% approval rating with an average rating of 6.61/10 based on 78 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A rocky start can't keep ''The Punisher'' from pushing the boundaries of Marvel's TV universe with a fresh take on the comics-derived action thriller.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/marvel_s_the_punisher/s01|title=Marvel's The Punisher: Season 1 (2017)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=February 29, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 55 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-the-punisher|title=Marvel's The Punisher : Season 1|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref> Summarizing the critical response to the entirety of the first season, ''[[GameSpot]]'' said reviews were \"mixed.\" It received mixed to negative reviews from the ''[[LA Times]]'' and ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]].''<ref name=\"1_Gamespot\">{{Citation| date=November 17, 2017| title=The Punisher Review Roundup: What Do Critics Think Of Netflix's Latest Marvel Show?\n|publisher=[[Gamespot]]| url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-punisher-review-roundup-what-do-critics-think-/1100-6455073/| accessdate=November 18, 2017}}</ref> \n\nThe ''[[Washington Post]]'' said that Netflix had finally gotten the franchise \"right\" in a live-action in a way the prior three movies had failed to please fans.

This extended to the repeated depictions of the death of Castle's wife, which Lightfoot did not think was in bad taste because it was about visualizing Castle's feelings, something he would not talk about; the deaths evolve through the season until they show Castle as the one killing her to signify that he blames himself for her death, which Lightfoot felt was important relationship building between Castle and the audience rather than just gratuitous violence.<ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n[[Collider (website)|Collider]] ranked the season as the fourth best

Six months later, he is awakened at 3:00 every morning by nightmares of his family's deaths. Castle passes much of his time working, taking down an old building. This angers the other workers, who are denied extra pay due to Castle's overtime. He also visits Curtis Hoyle, a veteran that Castle served alongside before his family died, and mentions that his time in Afghanistan involved some activities that he did not want to discuss. A new worker, Donny Chavez, attempts to befriend Castle, and proves himself to be eager to please the other workers. He agrees to help them steal money from a local gang, but he accidentally reveals his identity to the gangsters. The others attempt to kill Chavez at the worksite, but Castle is there and kills them first. He then kills the gangsters before they can hunt Chavez. Meanwhile, [[Homeland security]] agent Dinah Madani begins investigating Castle's Afghanistan troop, believing they killed her previous partner.\n |LineColor = 161719\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Punisher (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Two Dead Men\n |DirectedBy = Tom Shankland\n |WrittenBy = Steve Lightfoot\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary = A man calling himself \"Micro\" monitors cameras around New York City, and begins tracking Castle from the building where he murdered the gangsters. He contacts Castle and tells him to check a disk that he had left for Castle at his old family home; the disk contains footage of Castle and his unit in [[Kandahar]], torturing and murdering Madani's partner Ahmad Zubair. Madani had that video before it was stolen, and now wants to discuss Castle\u2014who is believed to be dead\u2014with his old army friend [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Billy Russo]]. Her superior Carson Wolf forbids her from this, but she convinces him to use Russo's new business Anvil for field training, and talks to Russo then. Castle's journalist friend [[Karen Page]] agrees to help him find Micro, and learns that he is former NSA analyst [[Microchip (comics)|David Lieberman]], who was caught leaking secrets and was believed to be killed. Wolf covered up the story, so Castle tortures and kills him, learning that the death of his family was just one attempt to kill him.

Soon after, Wolf hunted Lieberman down with special forces, shooting him and framing him for a crime. The shot hit Lieberman's cellphone and he was able to go underground. Lieberman gets the upper-hand on Castle, who reveals that in Kandahar he was selected for a special unit, Cerberus, alongside Russo, and they were used by a mysterious agent to hunt down and kill high value targets. Castle had not known who Zubair was when he was ordered to kill him, and had grown increasingly disillusioned with his command. When they ignored his and Russo's advice and went ahead with a mission that killed several other members of Cerberus, Castle was able to complete the mission in an intense killing spree, but he and Russo then transferred from the unit. Now, Castle agrees to work with Lieberman to hunt down those behind Cerberus.\n |LineColor = 161719\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Punisher (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = Resupply\n |DirectedBy = [[Kari Skogland]]\n |WrittenBy = Dario Scardapane\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary = Requiring weapons and ammunition, Castle gets Lieberman to search law enforcement databases for known shipments of guns. Castle follows a lead to dealer [[Turk Barrett]], but finds that the shipment was a special delivery and does not serve their needs. Barrett says that the main shipment is going to someone else, and Lieberman soon finds that Homeland security is working on an operation to buy the shipment in hopes of arresting those selling the weapons. Madani, now acting-Special Agent in Charge, wishes to investigate Wolf's murder, but is warned against pursuing the matter by another superior, and is instead told to focus on the weapons operation. She helps coordinate the operation, the plans for which Lieberman learned by hacking into Homeland security. He and Castle are able to disrupt the agents and hijack the weapons, but they are pursued by Madani. Lieberman crashes into Madani's vehicle, seriously injuring her.

Her team is interrogated regarding the failed weapons operation, but she does not reveal that Castle is alive, and instead convinces another agent, Sam Stein, to help her. She interviews Page, who later tells Castle about Madani's investigation. Meanwhile, William Rawlins\u2014the agent in charge of Cerberus\u2014receives a medal for his achievements during wartime, and is asked by the [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director of the CIA]] Marion James to serve as her deputy when she is promoted. Lieberman points out that the video of Zubair's murder must have been made by one of the other Cerberus soldiers, and Castle believes it was Gunner Henderson, who also knew what they were doing was wrong. They find Henderson living in seclusion, but Rawlins sends soldiers to kill them, discovering that Castle is alive.

Hoyle later bails Lewis Wilson, a young veteran that he had been trying to help rehabilitate, out of jail; he had been arrested protesting [[Gun politics in the United States|for the right to bear arms]], and had been abandoned by another veteran he had admired, O'Connor. Hoyle reveals that the latter had lied about serving, and Wilson finds and kills O'Connor. Madani and Russo sleep together, and he realizes that she is using him to investigate Castle. She tells him that Castle is alive, and Russo broadcasts a message that Lieberman picks up. Castle meets with Russo to explain that Cerberus was a front for a major drug operation, and that he is fighting to take down those responsible. Russo offers to give Castle a chance at a new life instead, but Castle turns him down. Madani finds Henderson's body, and deduces what happened. She also gains proof that Castle is alive from his blood being at the scene.

Russo tells Madani that he does not believe Castle is alive. She realizes that Henderson was only targeted after she had started investigating him, and that her office may be bugged; Madani and Stein find the device. Castle and Lieberman plan to take their next target, Col. Morty Bennett, one of the leaders of Cerberus. Rawlins and Russo expect this, and also discuss Madani's investigation, with Rawlins comfortable that she has no leads. He also tells Russo that he should have killed Castle when he had the chance. Castle infiltrates the military base where Bennet lives, but Russo is expecting him and attacks him with a group of soldiers. Castle fights them off, not knowing who Russo is beneath a mask, while Lieberman gains remote access to Bennett's phone. Castle then escapes, being forced to injure a young soldier on his way. They track Bennett's phone to Rawlins, who has Russo kill Bennett.

He later tells Madani that he grew up in the system. Lieberman and Castle identify Rawlins. The cameras that Lieberman is using to keep watch on his family go down, and he sends Castle to investigate. Castle has been spending time with Lieberman's wife Sarah since meeting her while investigating who \"Micro\" was, and finds out that she had disconnected the internet as punishment for her son, Zach. Castle reconnects the internet, and has some drinks with Sarah. She kisses him, but they both acknowledge that this is a mistake. She then asks Castle to intervene with Zach, and he realizes that the boy needs a father figure to spend time with. Knowing that she is being watched, Madani sets up a new operation, but releases false plans to be found. When Russo arrives at a warehouse with a team of mercenaries per that latter plan, he is ambushed by Homeland security. His team are all killed, but Russo is able to kill Stein and escape without Madani seeing him.\n |LineColor = 161719 \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Punisher (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = Front Toward Enemy\n |DirectedBy = Marc Jobst\n |WrittenBy = Angela LaManna\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n |ShortSummary = Castle agrees to contact Madani about Rawlins, but while he and Lieberman are watching her to ensure she is not corrupt, Wilson's bombs go off around New York, killing several people and injuring others. He targeted those he considered to be anti-guns, as explained in a letter he sends to Page in the hopes that she will champion him standing up against the system and publish his letter in her paper. She goes on the radio to disavow Wilson, who anonymously calls in to threaten her. Castle recognizes Wilson from the radio, having met him when visiting Hoyle once, and has Lieberman find Wilson. Meanwhile, Hoyle searches for Wilson, and when he tries to stop him, Wilson beats Hoyle with his own prosthetic leg and ties him to another bomb. Castle comes across this scene, and convinces Wilson to disarm the bomb, but not before Wilson calls the police. Castle is chased from the scene, his face caught on camera.

The series would be centered on [[Jon Bernthal]] as [[Punisher|Frank Castle]], and was described as a stand-alone series apart from those leading up to ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' crossover event.<ref name=\"PunisherTVLine\" /><ref name=\"PunisherTHR\" /><ref name=\"SarandosJan2016\" /> That April, Netflix officially ordered a full 13 episode season of ''The Punisher'', confirmed Bernthal's involvement, and named [[Steve Lightfoot]] as executive producer and showrunner.<ref name=\"PunisherEWApr2016\" /><ref name=\"PunisherEpCount\" /> Asked whether he would rather have a 10 episode season given the longer 13 episode-seasons have been criticized for other Marvel Netflix series, Lightfoot said that he wanted the season to be a \"slow burn show\" that was character-driven, and that he felt they had the right amount of story to fill the 13 episodes.<ref name=\"LightfootColliderJul2018\" />\n\n===Writing===\nLightfoot had a loose idea of what the \"journey of Season 1\" would be when he joined the series, and this was fleshed-out and altered in the writers room throughout work on the season.<ref name=\"LightfootColliderJul2018\" /> Executive producer [[Jeph Loeb]] said the season would ask the questions \"Who is Frank? What is Frank going to do? And who's going to try and stop Frank?\"<ref name=\"RT12Questions\" /> Lightfoot chose not to adapt any specific version of the character from the comics and instead looked to the work that was done in ''Daredevil'' defining the character. That series' depiction was what got Lightfoot interested in the character, and he wanted it to dictate this series' direction. ''The Punisher'' begins with a teaser featuring Castle killing the gang members that he believes are responsible for his family's death, which is a conclusion to the character's story in ''Daredevil''. The series then jumps ahead to the character \"stuck in the past and sort of crippled by this grief\".<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" /> The season also depicts some events from before the second season of ''Daredevil'', which Bernthal described as being \"loose with chronology\";<ref name=\"SFXMagazine\" /> this includes an explanation of Castle's time serving in [[Kandahar]], which had been mentioned in ''Daredevil'' and was something that Lightfoot felt this series should address.<ref name=\"Lightfoot/FilmNov2017\" />\n\nAs a fan of [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] and 1970s [[Urban fiction|urban]] [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]], Lightfoot felt that the series should combine those ideas due to Castle's antihero persona being an archetype of Western films but set in the urban environment of New York City. Lightfoot looked to films from those genres as inspiration for tone and style, ideas, and themes for the series, and also looked to 1970s [[Conspiracy fiction|conspiracy thriller]] films due to Castle being a fugitive in the series and the general sense of paranoia. The series makes a reference to ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'' (1976), while Lightfoot described the first episode of the series as a modern \"updating\" of ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953).<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" /> Lightfoot also took inspiration from the [[Bourne (film series)|''Bourne'' film series]] and the film ''[[American Sniper]]'' (2014) for the series.<ref name=\"RT12Questions\" /> Regarding his previous television series ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'', Lightfoot stated that he learned from that series' creator [[Bryan Fuller]] to make an antihero like [[Hannibal Lecter]] relatable to the audience by finding \"something in them that's universal that we can all feel\", such as Lector being lonely. Carrying this over to ''The Punisher'', Lightfoot saw in Castle the idea of \"a man whose family was taken from him at a young age\" and that a series focused on him should be an exploration of his grief and how he responds to it. Lightfoot felt that even audience members who did not agree with Castle's actions would be able to go on a \"journey\" with the character if they understood this aspect of him.<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=\"We talked a lot as we developed the show that once you take hold of the hand of violence it's impossible to let it go. That relationship to violence really interested me, not just the fact he has the ability to use it but also the cost of it.\"|source=\u2014Showrunner Steve Lightfoot on violence in ''The Punisher''<ref name=\"SFXMagazine\" />}}\nRather than show the \"beautiful\" scenes of horror that were created for ''Hannibal'', Lightfoot wanted to follow the lead of the character's fight scenes in ''Daredevil'' by not shying away from the cost of the actual actions, feeling that showing the brutal reality of Castle's actions would better convey to the audience that \"This stuff hurts, and it's not OK\" rather than glossing over the violence which he felt would have been worse.<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" /> He elaborated that he was unsure if the series was the most violent Marvel Netflix series, as he was simply taking the level of violence he saw depicted in ''Daredevil'' as a baseline for this series, and that it is important to remember that \"a lot of what he's doing is wrong. We have to let the audience lose him at times and let him win them back. To just wholeheartedly be behind him wouldn't be right\". Despite this, Lightfoot wanted to convey the character's feelings and thoughts to help the audience understand the character, and often used flashbacks or dreams featuring his family since Castle does not talk much and having constant flashbacks also represented how he is unable to stop thinking about them.<ref name=\"Lightfoot/FilmNov2017\" />\n\nLightfoot described Castle as a metaphor for \"the fact that we\u2019ve been sending men to war for 15 years now and then bringing them back and expecting them to just fit back in. Clearly, that isn't what happens.\" Having not served in the military himself, Lightfoot spent time with the rest of the series' writers reading first-person accounts and memoirs from real-life war veterans, and the series also had consultants from the military, the Special Forces, and the CIA including one military consultant who read every script of the series and gave notes. Noting that a vocal community of United States soldiers and veterans were fans of the Punisher character, Lightfoot and Bernthal ensured that the series was always respectful of the military and law enforcement despite Castle's actions being generally criminal; Lightfoot said it was an \"interesting thing to be respectful of the police and at the same time, the character is beyond the law.\" Feeling that it was not his place to preach about the politics of vigilantism or the [[Gun politics in the United States|United States gun control debate]], Lightfoot wanted to create a \"body of characters where you feel like all sides and issues were given a voice so the audience can decide\", from a veteran who is a \"gentle group-therapy leader\" to a \"gun nut\".<ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" /> When creating an original character for the series to serve as the \"tough nemesis cop\" who is hunting Castle, Lightfoot decided to \"mix the paradigm up\" by making the character female and having her be his equal. Lightfoot noted that the writer's room, which included both men and women, had \"a lot of fun\" with this idea. They also wanted the character to be of Middle Eastern descent and be as big of a patriot as Castle and an action hero in her own right. This character became Dinah Madani. Lightfoot did not want the \"spiderweb\" of supporting characters in the series to be \"sidekicks\" to Castle, and instead have \"their own narrative and their own story that was the most important thing to them\".<ref name=\"LightfootRTNov2017\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher,<ref name=\"PunisherEWApr2016\" /> [[Ebon Moss-Bachrach]] as [[Microchip (comics)|David Lieberman / Micro]],<ref name=\"MarvelOct2016\" /><ref name=\"MicroName\" /> [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] as [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Billy Russo]], [[Amber Rose Revah]] as Dinah Madani,<ref name=\"MarvelOct2016\" /> [[Daniel Webber (actor)|Daniel Webber]] as Lewis Wilson,<ref name=\"NewCastOct2016\" /><ref name=\"Wilson\" /> [[Paul Schulze]] as [[William Rawlins]], [[Jason R.

Mahome, whose father served in the military, found this to be a powerful experience and helpful for his acting in the series.<ref name=\"Mahome\" />\n\n===Design===\nStephanie Maslansky, who served as costume designer for the first seasons of ''Daredevil'', ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', and ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', had the choice between designing for ''The Defenders'' or for ''The Punisher'' due to a scheduling conflict between the two productions, and chose to work on ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"MaslanskyElite\" /> Instead, Lorraine Calvert designed the costumes for ''The Punisher'' after introducing the look of the character in the second season of ''Daredevil''; her take on the character's \"beloved\" comic-inspired costume balances the original design, Bernthal's needs as an actor and interpretation of the character, and Lightfoot's intentions for the tone of the series.<ref name=\"Calvert\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on October 3, 2016 in Brooklyn, New York,<ref name=\"PunisherFilming1\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> under the working title ''Crime''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> Locations for the production included [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]],<ref name=\"GreenpointFilming\" /> the [[Williamsburg Bridge]], [[Columbus Circle]] and [[Central Park West]], Cortlandt Alley, [[Circle Line Downtown]] cruises, the Manhattan Family Court building, [[Long Island City]], Grand Ferry Park in South [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], [[Sunnyside, Queens]], [[Pulaski Bridge]], the [[Roosevelt Island]] and its steam plant, the [[Bronx County Courthouse]], [[Newtown Creek]], [[The Roosevelt Hotel (Manhattan)|The Roosevelt Hotel]], [[Astoria Park]], [[Tudor City]], [[Hunts Point, Bronx]], the [[Forest Park Carousel]], the [[Bronx\u2013Whitestone Bridge]],<ref name=\"UntappedCities\" /> the \"[[Goodfellas|GoodFellas Diner]]\" before it was damaged in a 2018 fire and the [[Mount Zion Cemetery (New York City)|Mount Zion Cemetery]], both in [[Maspeth, Queens]],<ref name=\"GoodFellas\" /><ref name=\"UntappedCities\" /> and in [[Astoria, Queens]].<ref name=\"AstoriaFilming\" /> A car chase for the season was filmed at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] in night shoots, with Moss-Bachrach driving one of the cars.<ref name=\"Moss-BachrachRTNov2017\" /> Filming for the season [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on April 9, 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingWrap\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects supervisor Greg Anderson and vendor [[FuseFX]] returned from the first season of ''Luke Cage'' to create the visual effects for ''The Punisher'', creating 855 visual effects shots across the season. Their team changed in size for each episode, but generally consisted of 15 to 20 people.<ref name=\"FuseAX\" /> Due to the realistic tone of the series, which does not feature any superpowers, the visual effects department had to work even harder than usual to ensure their effects were believable,<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" /><ref name=\"FuseAX\" /> with a focus on creating \"gunplay, knifeplay, explosions and other real world effects.\" They preferred to augment practical effects rather than start from scratch to help with realism as well as the series' budget and schedule.<ref name=\"FuseAX\" />\n\nAs an example of the work Fuse did during fight sequences, Anderson discussed the scene where Russo and his men attack Micro's basement. Though practical prop weapons were used for the fight, Fuse had to augment the action with computer generated blood, knives, and muzzle flashes, as well as a computer generated head that is blown apart by a shotgun. The sequence was thoroughly storyboarded and pre-visualized to plan out the exact visuals required. Because the scene, like many others throughout the season, required a dark environment the visual effects team had to work with the cinematography department to decide where the low-light should be practical and where color-grading could be used to alter a more brightly-lit set given it is difficult to integrate visual effects with dark images. Conversely to this scene, a sequence such as when Russo blows up a hideout required minimal visual effects work because the explosion was shot practically, with Fuse mainly just adding some windows to the building that were removed for the explosion.<ref name=\"FuseAX\" /> \n\nThe most technically difficult scene of the season to create was in the first episode, where Castle shoots someone from across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. Anderson estimated that the scene was 90 percent digital, with the environment between Castle and his target created entirely by the visual effects department.<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" /> So that Moore could portray amputee Curtis Hoyle, Fuse had to digitally replace his leg in several shots. This involved Moore wearing a green sleeve over his leg and Fuse replacing it with a stump. The company also had to recreate the background behind Moore's actual leg which was often the most difficult part, such as when he is getting out of bed and realistic-looking digital cloth needed to match with the actual sheets that were on set.<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" /> Additionally, visual effects were used to augment cement in the sequence where people are thrown into it. The special effects department created a mixture to look like cement for use while filming the scene, but it ultimately did not look realistic on camera and had to be changed digitally.<ref name=\"AndersonBGP\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn April 2017, [[Tyler Bates]] was announced as the composer for ''The Punisher'', after previously composing for Marvel's ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''.<ref name=\"Bates\" /> In order to \"get into the dark corners of the Punisher's mind,\" Bates played \"more of a broken blues\" guitar, which was augmented with talkbox effects and other \"guitar noises\", along with guitar-vol and melodica. On this style, Bates said, \"The rough edges and broken nature of [music like this] leaves a great deal of space for emotion and interesting color\u2014and a bit of an attitude. Otherwise it's not going to be an authentic expression of the idea. There's a darkness in there that I'm happy to tap into.\"<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by [[Hollywood Records]] on November 17, 2017 in conjunction with the season's Netflix release.

The pair felt with the increased marketing of the season, it would release \"sooner rather than later\".<ref name=\"DeadlineReleaseSep2017\" /> Allison Keene of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] expressed irritation at this because she and other television journalists were unable to plan content without knowing the release date, while fans anticipating the series would watch it \"whenever it appears\" regardless of when the date is announced.<ref name=\"ColliderReleaseDate\" /> ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'}}s Susana Polo felt Marvel and Netflix would announce the date at their scheduled [[New York Comic Con]] 2017 panel in October, as the convention had been used in previous years to reveal \"breaking fall Marvel/Netflix news\".<ref name=\"PolygonReleaseDate\" /> It was soon reported that this was indeed the case, with Netflix planning a surprise \"drop\" release of the season after the New York Comic Con panel,<ref name=\"VegasShooting\" /><ref name=\"ReleaseDelayed\" /> mimicking a strategy from the music industry where an artist's album is released \"with little or no fanfare\".<ref name=\"ReleaseDelayed\" /> However, Marvel and Netflix decided to delay the release of the season to later in 2017 following the [[Las Vegas shooting]] and subsequent cancelling of the panel.<ref name=\"ReleaseDelayed\" /><ref name=\"VegasShooting\" /> Two weeks later, the November 17 release was announced.<ref name=\"NovemberRelease\" />\n\nRegarding the decisions made concerning the New York Comic Con panel and the season's release, Loeb said that they were made \"specifically because it was a week after a horrible, horrible incident. It hasn't changed the television series, the show is not predominantly about gun violence, and in fact it shows you the problems that occur in that world.\"<ref name=\"LoebOct2017\" /> Bernthal and Lightfoot felt delaying the release of the season \"was the right decision\" out of respect for the victims,<ref name=\"BernthalIndieWire\" /><ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" /> with Lightfoot saying there was no reason to go ahead with the panel if it was going to upset \"even one person involved\" with the shooting.<ref name=\"LightfootVultureNov2017\" /> Moore had initially felt the season would not be released at all once the panel was cancelled.<ref name=\"Collider30ThingsS2\" /> Between the Las Vegas shooting and subsequent delaying of the season, and the eventual November 17 release, the United States experienced another [[mass shooting]] with the [[Sutherland Springs church shooting]]. Bernthal hoped that these two shootings and the release of the season would together help further the discussion on [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]], with \"all sides of this debate\" represented in ''The Punisher''.<ref name=\"BernthalIndieWire\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nBernthal and Woll appeared at New York Comic Con in October 2016 to officially announce the start of production on the series and the latter's involvement,<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> while Bernthal presented exclusive footage from the series at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2017.<ref name=\"SDCCFootage\" /> A teaser was revealed on Netflix in August 2017 after the credits of the final episode of ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"DefendersTagTeaser\" /> Also in the month, the series' [[Twitter]] account revealed the episode titles as [[Morse code]] messages.<ref name=\"EpisodeTitles\" /> In September 2017, the series' [[Instagram]] account released viral videos made to look like security footage,<ref name=\"InstagramVideos\" /> while episodic photos and a poster for the season with a redacted release date were also released.<ref name=\"DeadlineReleaseSep2017\" /> On September 20, the official trailer for the season was released. Andrew Liptak of ''[[The Verge]]'' said it \"sets up ''The Punisher'' with its own distinct tone that's different from the other Marvel Netflix shows. It wades into government conspiracies and hacking, which is reminiscent of shows like [[CBS]]'s ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'' or [[USA Network|USA]]'s ''[[Mr. Robot]]'', but with more gunfire.\"<ref name=\"VergeTrailer\" /> [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]'s Kendall Ashley called the trailer \"intense, super bloody, and has [me] INCREDIBLY pumped for the show's premiere.\" She added that \"if this trailer is any indication, ''The Punisher'' is definitely going to live up to fan expectations\". Ashley felt the inclusion of \"[[One (Metallica song)|One]]\" by [[Metallica]] in the trailer \"helps paint Frank as a badass unlike any we've seen on the Marvel Netflix shows so far.\"<ref name=\"NerdistTrailer\" /> Cooper Hood, writing for [[Screen Rant]] felt the trailer would \"only increase the fever for\" the series despite it not yet having a release date, with it more closely fitting the \"mold\" of the character than the more cryptic videos previously released. He also found it \"well-cut\" to the beat of the song, which he praised as \"amplifying the intensity\".<ref name=\"ScreenRantTrailer\" />\n\nBy the end of September, Netflix had updated their viral website for the ''New York Bulletin'' to include a profile page for Karen Page. After revealing her login credentials in a post on ''Daredevil''{{'}}s Facebook page, readers who visited Page's profile found images referencing Page's research into Castle from the second season of ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"NYBulletinViralSite\" /> Bernthal and other members of the cast were scheduled to appear at New York Comic Con 2017 to promote the season,<ref name=\"NYCC2017\" /> but the panel was cancelled after the 2017 Las Vegas Strip shooting.<ref name=\"VegasShooting\" /> Two weeks later, a second trailer was released revealing the season's release date of November 17, 2017. Tom Philip at ''[[GQ]]'' was not very enthused with the trailer, saying it was \"hard to get super jazzed about another gritty, ultra-violent, gun-loving, non-superhero show right now.\" He was critical of the \"utilitarian-sounding writing\" in the trailer, but felt the chemistry between Bernthal and Woll would be a reason to watch the series. Philip also felt the addition of Moss-Bachrach was \"curious\", and said \"at least [the series is] a swing for the fences from a TV studio that tends to play it astoundingly safe.\"<ref name=\"GQTrailer2\" /> Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted that the gun violence sequences featured were mainly \"flashbacks with military men doing military things in full fatigues or scenes of bad guys shooting at not-so-bad guys with heavy gunfire\", which was a strong contrast to the first trailer. Mendelson felt this shift in the marketing strategy could have been in response to the Las Vegas shootings.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer2\" /> [[TechCrunch]]'s Darrell Etherington agreed with Mendelson, noting how the trailer \"plays up Castle's motivations and the more human side of the story\", while still looking \"gritty and dark, [and] Bernthal's portrayal looking as strong as ever.\" Etherington also criticized the soundtrack of the trailer.<ref name=\"TechCrunchTrailer2\" /> ''The Punisher'' had its red carpet premiere on November 6, 2017, in New York City at the [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] [[AMC Loews]] theatre.<ref name=\"Premiere\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 67% approval rating with an average rating of 6.61/10 based on 78 reviews.

This extended to the repeated depictions of the death of Castle's wife, which Lightfoot did not think was in bad taste because it was about visualizing Castle's feelings, something he would not talk about; the deaths evolve through the season until they show Castle as the one killing her to signify that he blames himself for her death, which Lightfoot felt was important relationship building

''Rolling Stone'' reported that the band was not upset at this development, as they were not particularly enamored with the idea of \"Hotel California\" being adapted into a film.
