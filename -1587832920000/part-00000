He has been active in his YouTube Channel, '''FumiShun Base''', since 2015. His fame grew when he became the first pure Japanese official housemate in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso]], a reality TV show for Filipinos.

He is the eldest in their family. \n\nAfter his High School graduation, Fumiya started living alone in [[Tokyo]] while pursuing his vocational degree in Hotel Management.\n\nHe joined the hospitality workforce after his graduation from vocational school and worked in a hotel in [[Shinjuku]] as a bell boy. He resigned from his hotel job after two years and decided to pursue his dream of establishing his own clothing line. \n\nHe thought that being famous would make his clothes sell faster and one way would be to become famous as a vlogger. He then started making YouTube videos.\n\n=== 2017 \u2013 Present: Life in the Philippines ===\nHaving observed their hotel guests, he realized that being able to speak English is important for his business plans. On the 28<sup>th</sup> day of April, 2017, he flew to the Philippines to study English.<ref name=\":3\">{{Citation|title=I'm back on YouTube!!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCGuUXSewvc|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nHe attended the [[Lyceum of the Philippines University|Lyceum of the Philippines]] in Manila for his English lessons. \n\nHe learnt of the PBB audition from his Filipino followers. He attended and documented his audition for his vlog content but he was able to pass all the screenings and became an official PBB OTSO housemate.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAfter PBB, he stayed in the Philippines to pursue a career in show-business.\n<br />\n\n==Career==\n\n===YouTube===\n\nFumiya established his YouTube channel, '''FumiShun Base''', with his brother Shunya on December 2, 2015, but only posted their first video on September 6, 2016. \n\nWhile studying in the Philippines, he continued to upload videos in his YouTube channel as a means to update his parents of his whereabouts. \n\nHe started uploading YouTube contents for Filipinos on the 31<sup>st</sup> of May 2017. His first video was a reaction video of [[Sarah Geronimo]]'s [[Kilometro (song)|Kilometro]]. From then on, he started gaining Filipino followers.\n\nOn April 2018, his channel hit 100K subscribers awarding him with the YouTube Silver play button.<ref>{{Citation|title=MARAMING SALAMAT PO!!!!!!!!!!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R9htbO1t6M|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> On March 7, 2019, he hit the one million subscribers mark, awarding him with a gold play button.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://starcinema.abs-cbn.com/2019/3/7/news/fumiya-sankai-hits-1-million-subscribers-on-youtub-47849|title=Fumiya Sankai hits 1 million subscribers on YouTube! {{!}} Star Cinema|last=Admin|first=Star Cinema|website=starcinema.abs-cbn.com|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://push.abs-cbn.com/2019/3/7/fresh-scoops/pbb-housemate-fumiya-sankai-hits-1-million-youtube-203967|title=PBB housemate Fumiya Sankai hits 1 million Youtube subscribers {{!}} PUSH.COM.PH: Your ultimate showbiz hub!|last=TEAM|first=PUSH|website=push.abs-cbn.com|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome notable vlogs were his song covers of [[I\u00f1igo Pascual]]\u2019s [[Dahil Sa'yo|Dahil Sayo]], [[Daniel Padilla]]\u2019s [[Simpleng Tulad Mo]], [[Juan Karlos Labajo|Juan Karlos]]\u2019 Buwan, [[Maja Salvador]]\u2019s Dahan Dahan, and [[Ex Battalion|Ex Battallion]]\u2019s [[Hayaan Mo Sila]] which was featured in [[Rated K]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/trending/03/18/18/viral-japanese-guy-covers-hayaan-mo-sila|title=VIRAL: Japanese guy covers 'Hayaan Mo Sila'|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|website=ABS-CBN News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.abs-cbn.com/videos/44040719-the-life-of-andre-lou-fumiya-and-yamyam-before-joining-pbb-226307|title=Rated K: The life of Andre, Lou, Fumiya and Yamyam before joining PBB {{!}} ABS-CBN Entertainment|website=ent.abs-cbn.com|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nOther notable vlogs are his auditions to [[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso|PBB Otso]] in Araneta Cubao and Cebu.\n\nWhen the channel started, Japanese was the primary language used in his videos. English subtitles were added since most of his subscribers were Filipinos. After his stint in PBB, he shifted to a mixture of English and Tagalog. Subtitles were no longer added. \n\nThis posed a problem for his growing fanbase. With the growing demand from Japanese subscribers, he established the '''Hiragana FumiShun Base''' '''(\u3075\u307f\u3057\u3085\u3093\u3079\u30fc\u3059)''' YouTube Channel on April 13, 2020. This channel uses pure Japanese.\n\n===Business===\nFumiya\u2019s dream was to establish his very own clothing line. Most of his business ventures are aligned to this dream.\n\nFumiya opened the official shop for his YouTube channel on June 22, 2019. The shop features his original designs from when he started his channel. Items were sold out on the first week.\n\nHe also did a collaboration with Livertineage Japan.

He is the eldest in their family. \n\nAfter his High School graduation, Fumiya started living alone in [[Tokyo]] while pursuing his vocational degree in Hotel Management.\n\nHe joined the hospitality workforce after his graduation from vocational school and worked in a hotel in [[Shinjuku]] as a bell boy. He resigned from his hotel job after two years and decided to pursue his dream of establishing his own clothing line. \n\nHe thought that being famous would make his clothes sell faster and one way would be to become famous as a vlogger. He then started making YouTube videos.\n\n=== 2017 \u2013 Present: Life in the Philippines ===\nHaving observed their hotel guests, he realized that being able to speak English is important for his business plans. On the 28<sup>th</sup> day of April, 2017, he flew to the Philippines to study English.<ref name=\":3\">{{Citation|title=I'm back on YouTube!!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCGuUXSewvc|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nHe attended the [[Lyceum of the Philippines University|Lyceum of the Philippines]] in Manila for his English lessons. \n\nHe learnt of the PBB audition from his Filipino followers. He attended and documented his audition for his vlog content but he was able to pass all the screenings and became an official PBB OTSO housemate.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAfter PBB, he stayed in the Philippines to pursue a career in show-business.\n<br />\n\n==Career==\n\n===YouTube===\n\nFumiya established his YouTube channel, '''FumiShun Base''', with his brother Shunya on December 2, 2015, but only posted their first video on September 6, 2016. \n\nWhile studying in the Philippines, he continued to upload videos in his YouTube channel as a means to update his parents of his whereabouts. \n\nHe started uploading YouTube contents for Filipinos on the 31<sup>st</sup> of May 2017. His first video was a reaction video of [[Sarah Geronimo]]'s [[Kilometro (song)|Kilometro]]. From then on, he started gaining Filipino followers.\n\nOn April 2018, his channel hit 100K subscribers awarding him with the YouTube Silver play button.<ref>{{Citation|title=MARAMING SALAMAT PO!!!!!!!!!!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R9htbO1t6M|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> On March 7, 2019, he hit the one million subscribers mark, awarding him with a gold play button.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://starcinema.abs-cbn.com/2019/3/7/news/fumiya-sankai-hits-1-million-subscribers-on-youtub-47849|title=Fumiya Sankai hits 1 million subscribers on YouTube! {{!}} Star Cinema|last=Admin|first=Star Cinema|website=starcinema.abs-cbn.com|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://push.abs-cbn.com/2019/3/7/fresh-scoops/pbb-housemate-fumiya-sankai-hits-1-million-youtube-203967|title=PBB housemate Fumiya Sankai hits 1 million Youtube subscribers {{!}} PUSH.COM.PH: Your ultimate showbiz hub!|last=TEAM|first=PUSH|website=push.abs-cbn.com|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome notable vlogs were his song covers of [[I\u00f1igo Pascual]]\u2019s [[Dahil Sa'yo|Dahil Sayo]], [[Daniel Padilla]]\u2019s [[Simpleng Tulad Mo]], [[Juan Karlos Labajo|Juan Karlos]]\u2019 Buwan, [[Maja Salvador]]\u2019s Dahan Dahan, and [[Ex Battalion|Ex Battallion]]\u2019s [[Hayaan Mo Sila]] which was featured in [[Rated K]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/trending/03/18/18/viral-japanese-guy-covers-hayaan-mo-sila|title=VIRAL: Japanese guy covers 'Hayaan Mo Sila'|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|website=ABS-CBN News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.abs-cbn.com/videos/44040719-the-life-of-andre-lou-fumiya-and-yamyam-before-joining-pbb-226307|title=Rated K: The life of Andre, Lou, Fumiya and Yamyam before joining PBB {{!}} ABS-CBN Entertainment|website=ent.abs-cbn.com|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nOther notable vlogs are his auditions to [[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso|PBB Otso]] in Araneta Cubao and Cebu.\n\nWhen the channel started, Japanese was the primary language used in his videos. English subtitles were added since most of his subscribers were Filipinos. After his stint in PBB, he shifted to a mixture of English and Tagalog. Subtitles were no longer added. \n\nThis posed a problem for his growing fanbase. With the growing demand from Japanese subscribers, he established the '''Hiragana FumiShun Base''' '''(\u3075\u307f\u3057\u3085\u3093\u3079\u30fc\u3059)''' YouTube Channel on April 13, 2020.

The use of animal models in Barnes research is translated into treatments used for abnormal functioning of the brain aimed at prolonging the cognitive lifespan of older individuals. The nature of Barnes research entails the use of behavioral, anatomical, [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] and molecular techniques\u00a0 to further examine the implications of normal aging on the brain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychology.arizona.edu/users/carol-barnes|title=Carol Barnes {{!}} Department of Psychology|website=psychology.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> Most areas of her research involves examining and observing the [[hippocampus]] structure in the brains of rats and monkeys, observing and recording\u00a0synaptic transmission in cell to cell signaling, and genomic sequencing.\n\n=== [[Barnes maze|Barnes Maze]] ===\nTo study spatial learning and memory, Carol Barnes utilized a maze to test whether mice could remember the location of an escape box on a platform. This test has become a standard method of memory testing in laboratories. Designed in 1979, Barnes' maze was an alternative to study memory without the use of external reward or punishment, while also reducing the stress put on the animal throughout the process.\n[[File:Barnes_maze.jpg|thumb|The Barnes maze]]\n\nThe original study consisted of a platform (122&nbsp;cm diameter) raised 91&nbsp;cm above the floor with 18 circular holes (9.5&nbsp;cm diameters) spaced evenly around the perimeter. Under one of the holes is a black escape box, or any dark color in contrast to the color of the platform; the rest of the holes lead to false escape boxes. \n\nThe study consisted of 3 variations of the experiment. First, the mouse simply had to find the escape chamber that was placed under one of the holes. Second, the escape chamber was moved to a hole rotated 120-140 degrees from the original hole; the original hole was covered. Third, the same method as the second variation was used except the original hole was not covered. Barnes and her team found that overall, male mice performed better in all variations of the experiment. Further, they found younger mice also performed better in all variations, while older mice demonstrated notable difficulties in variations 2 and 3. This showed aging impairment in [[spatial memory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gawel|first=Kinga|last2=Gibula|first2=Ewa|last3=Marszalek-Grabska|first3=Marta|last4=Filarowska|first4=Joanna|last5=Kotlinska|first5=Jolanta H.|date=2019-01-01|title=Assessment of spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze task in rodents\u2014methodological consideration|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=392|issue=1|pages=1\u201318|doi=10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|issn=1432-1912|pmc=6311199|pmid=30470917}}</ref>\n[[File:Hippocampus.png|thumb|Hippocampus]]\n\n\nSpatial memory corresponds to the functioning of the [[hippocampus]], while route learning involves the [[Striatum|striatal]] systems. Overall, mice and other rodents of various ages learned T-mazes within the same number of trials, but the strategies used to learn and remember mazes differed with age. Young rats predominately utilized \u201cplace\u201d strategies which rely upon [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] functioning, while older rats relied upon \u201cresponse\u201d strategies. \n\nUsing [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] imaging techniques, Barnes and her team were able to see that in normally aged brains of rodents, the size of the [[hippocampus]] did not change. Instead, the volume of [[Grey matter|cortical grey matter]] did. This animal model allowed an understanding of what the brain looks like during normal human functioning. From this understanding, it was compared to brains that have been degenerated due to [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer\u2019s disease]] (rodents do not exhibit AD). These findings demonstrate that during normal aging the [[hippocampus]] remains the same size, its function may decrease in comparison to functions of other areas of the brain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samson|first=Rachel D.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2013|title=Impact of Aging Brain Circuits on Cognition|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694726/|journal=The European journal of neuroscience|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1903\u20131915|doi=10.1111/ejn.12183|issn=0953-816X|pmc=3694726|pmid=23773059|via=}}</ref>\n\nLooking deeper into the tissue affected, single-cell imaging showed there were 3 main types of cells that make up the [[hippocampus]]. When observing cell activity and the number of cells of the hippocampus of rats, it was found that the [[CA1 neuron|CA1]] and [[CA3 region|CA3]] [[pyramidal cell]]s continued to be active and of the same volume. However, the number of [[granule cell]]s of the [[dentate gyrus]] continuously decreased with age; the function of these cells also declined leading Carol and her team to conclude these gyrus cells are the weak link of the hippocampal circuit involved in memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Carol A.|date=2011-10-03|title=Secrets of aging: What does a normally aging brain look like?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3186042/|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|volume=3|doi=10.3410/B3-22|issn=1757-594X|pmc=3186042|pmid=22003369}}</ref>\n\nA few of Barnes\u2019s latest research publication was published in 2017 are:\u00a0 \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016643281630420X Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in the macaque monkeys]\u201d, \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174334 Evidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus]\u201d, and \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317305615 The aging navigational system]\u201d.\n\n=== Primate Research ===\n[[File:Brain_regions_involved_in_memory_formation.jpg|thumb|Brain regions involved in memory formation]]\nIn addition to work on rodent models, Dr. Barnes has helped advance the field of normative aging research using nonhuman primate models, specifically [[Macaque|macaque monkeys]].\u00a0 Primarily, Barnes\u2019 early work in macaques helped to tie together neurobiological data collected from rodents and functional imaging data from older humans. In the paper \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848213/ Memory impairment in aged primates is associated with region-specific network dysfunction]\u201d Barnes and her team showed that older monkeys had significant impairment on object recognition. In addition, older monkeys displayed a lower density of inhibitory somatostatin positive [[interneuron]]s in the [[CA3 region|CA3]] sub-region of the [[hippocampus]]. These [[interneuron]]s are responsible for regulating the activity of excitatory neurons in the [[hippocampus]]. With less [[interneuron]] density, the baseline firing rate of [[CA3 region|CA3]] excitatory neurons was elevated. This finding relates to the increased hippocampal activity shown in imaging studies of older human adults. Both a decrease in [[interneuron]] density and increase baseline firing rates in the [[hippocampus]] have been associated with poor cognition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2019-12-26|title=Experiments in macaque monkeys provide critical insights into age-associated changes in cognitive and sensory function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6936691/|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=116|issue=52|pages=26247\u201326254|doi=10.1073/pnas.1902279116|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6936691|pmid=31871147}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in the paper \u201cEvidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus\u201d Dr. Barnes and her team found evidence that all mammals require the same quantity of neurons in the hippocampus to encode memory of a single experience. This finding suggests that tall mammals use a stable amount of neurons to encode a similar virtual reality experience. However, due to variable hippocampus size, the proportion of neurons used for the encoding of experience differ. Rodents have the smallest [[hippocampus]] and thus use 40% of their [[hippocampus]] neurons for encoding, nonhuman primates have larger hippocampus and use 4%, and finally humans have the largest [[hippocampus]] and use an estimated 2.5% for experiential encoding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wixted|first=John T.|last2=Goldinger|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Squire|first3=Larry R.|last4=Kuhn|first4=Joel R.|last5=Papesh|first5=Megan H.|last6=Smith|first6=Kris A.|last7=Treiman|first7=David M.|last8=Steinmetz|first8=Peter N.|date=2018-01-30|title=Coding of episodic memory in the human hippocampus|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/115/5/1093|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=115|issue=5|pages=1093\u20131098|doi=10.1073/pnas.1716443115|issn=0027-8424|pmid=29339476|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nDr. Barnes has also done research to see how executive function changes with normative aging. [[Executive functions]] are the higher order process humans take part in such as attention, decision making, impulse control, and emotional control. These functions are mediated by the activity of the [[Prefrontal cortex|Prefrontal Cortex]]. Once again studying [[macaque]]s, Barnes and her team focused on two aspects of executive function, attentional monitoring and updating as well as [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]]. Attentional monitoring and updating allow for behavior changes with corresponding rule changes. For example, when two options are presented one is the correct choice initially; however, when the correct choice changes to the second option, attentional monitoring and updating help correct for the rule change and alter behavior in order to choose correctly. The change in behavior is mediated through a process of trial and error, which helps associate the right choice with certain behaviors. Barnes and her team found that older monkeys needed a greater number of trials to accurately account for a rule change. Suggesting, the executive system behind attentional monitoring and updating is impaired with aging. Secondly, [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]] is the ability to unconsciously shift attention between tasks while maintaining accuracy. In her research, Barnes presented macaque monkeys with an object recognition test of previously learned objects. She then presented interfering objects which required shifts between the object choice and evaluation of novel objects. Her results showed that older monkeys performed better on object recognition with this interference than younger monkeys. Thus set shifting abilities seem to be maintained if not enhanced with aging. The most important discovery out of these studies, however, is that the two aspects of executive function, monitoring and updating and set shifting, were shown to be independent systems that are affected differently with age. Thus, Barnes and her team suggest that changes in the [[Prefrontal cortex|Prefrontal Cortex]] can result from aging but different sub-regions within it show different patterns of aging.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Smith|first2=Anne C.|last3=Burke|first3=Sara N.|last4=Gazzaley|first4=Adam|last5=Barnes|first5=Carol A.|date=2017-03-30|title=Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in macaque monkeys|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493156/|journal=Behavioural brain research|volume=322|issue=Pt B|pages=329\u2013338|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2016.06.056|issn=0166-4328|pmc=5493156|pmid=27368416}}</ref>\n\nA final research contribution of Carol A Barnes involves the study of spatial networks and spatial memories in aging [[macaque]]s. Barnes and her team studied brain activity in four different conditions for movement: cages, sitting, walking on a treadmill, and freely walking in space. The study found that younger macaques have distinct spatial networks for all four distinct conditions. However, older monkeys displayed less discrete activity of spatial networks. Meaning, all conditions evoked activation of the same undifferentiated network. This finding suggests dynamic network changes as a possible explanation for spatial cognition deficits. In other words, the spatial processing networks become less precise with age and may contribute to spatial memory loss or confusion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Engle|first=James R.|last2=Machado|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Permenter|first3=Michele R.|last4=Vogt|first4=Julie A.|last5=Maurer|first5=Andrew P.|last6=Bulleri|first6=Alicia M.|last7=Barnes|first7=Carol A.|date=2016-11-30|title=Network Patterns Associated with Navigation Behaviors Are Altered in Aged Nonhuman Primates|url=https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/48/12217|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=36|issue=48|pages=12217\u201312227|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4116-15.2016|issn=0270-6474|pmid=27903730|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Family ==\nBarnes interest of normative aging in the brain stems from her grandfather when she and her family noticed that his memory was declining.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sherva|first=Kara|date=2015|title=Carol Barnes: A Prominent Voice in the Neuroscience of Aging, and a Proponent of Women in Neuroscience|url=https://soundideas.pugetsound.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=soundneuroscience|journal=Sound Neuroscience: An Undergraduate Neuroscience Journal|volume=2|pages=|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, Barnes is included in the [https://neurotree.org/beta/tree.php?pid=547 Neuroscience Academic Family Tree] .

Barnes research spans 4 decades aiming to better understand the aging of the brain in relation to cognitive diseases. Her research is conducted by utilizing animal models such as primates and rats to explore and understand how memory is impacted in the normal aging process of the brain through means of neurobiological mechanisms that are involved. The use of animal models in Barnes research is translated into treatments used for abnormal functioning of the brain aimed at prolonging the cognitive lifespan of older individuals. The nature of Barnes research entails the use of behavioral, anatomical, [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] and molecular techniques\u00a0 to further examine the implications of normal aging on the brain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychology.arizona.edu/users/carol-barnes|title=Carol Barnes {{!}} Department of Psychology|website=psychology.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> Most areas of her research involves examining and observing the [[hippocampus]] structure in the brains of rats and monkeys, observing and recording\u00a0synaptic transmission in cell to cell signaling, and genomic sequencing.\n\n=== [[Barnes maze|Barnes Maze]] ===\nTo study spatial learning and memory, Carol Barnes created her own maze to test whether rodents, specifically mice, could remember the location of an escape box on a platform. This test has become a standard method of memory testing in laboratories. Designed in 1979, Barnes' maze was an alternative to study memory without the use of external reward or punishment, while also reducing the stress put on the animal throughout the process.\n[[File:Barnes_maze.jpg|thumb|The Barnes maze]]\nThe original study consisted of a platform (122&nbsp;cm diameter) raised 91&nbsp;cm above the floor with 18 circular holes (9.5&nbsp;cm diameters) spaced evenly around the perimeter. Under one of the holes is a black escape box, or any dark color in contrast to the color of the platform; the rest of the holes lead to false escape boxes. The study consisted of 3 variations of the experiment. First, the mouse simply had to find the escape chamber that was placed under one of the holes. Second, the escape chamber was moved to a hole rotated 120-140 degrees from the original hole; the original hole was covered. Third, the same method as the second variation was used except the original hole was not covered. Barnes and her team found that overall, male mice performed better in all variations of the experiment. Further, they found younger mice also performed better in all variations, while older mice demonstrated notable difficulties in variations 2 and 3. This showed aging impairment in [[spatial memory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gawel|first=Kinga|last2=Gibula|first2=Ewa|last3=Marszalek-Grabska|first3=Marta|last4=Filarowska|first4=Joanna|last5=Kotlinska|first5=Jolanta H.|date=2019-01-01|title=Assessment of spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze task in rodents\u2014methodological consideration|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=392|issue=1|pages=1\u201318|doi=10.1007/s00210-018-1589-y|issn=1432-1912|pmc=6311199|pmid=30470917}}</ref>\n[[File:Hippocampus.png|thumb|Hippocampus]]\nSpatial memory corresponds to the functioning of the [[hippocampus]], while route learning involves the [[Striatum|striatal]] systems. Overall, rodents of various ages learned T-mazes within the same number of trials, but the strategies used to learn and remember mazes differed with age. Young rats predominately utilized \u201cplace\u201d strategies which rely upon [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] functioning, while older rats relied upon \u201cresponse\u201d strategies. Using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] imaging techniques, Barnes and her team were able to see that in normally aged brains of rodents, the size of the [[hippocampus]] did not change while the volume of [[Grey matter|cortical grey matter]] did. This animal model allowed an understanding of what the brain looks like during normal human functioning to compare it to brains that have been degenerated due to [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer\u2019s disease]] (rodents do not exhibit AD). These findings demonstrate that while during normal aging the [[hippocampus]] remains the same size, its function may decrease in comparison to functions of other areas of the brain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samson|first=Rachel D.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2013|title=Impact of Aging Brain Circuits on Cognition|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694726/|journal=The European journal of neuroscience|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1903\u20131915|doi=10.1111/ejn.12183|issn=0953-816X|pmc=3694726|pmid=23773059|via=}}</ref>\n\nLooking deeper into the tissue affected, single-cell imaging showed there were 3 main types of cells that make up the [[hippocampus]]. When observing cell activity and the number of cells of the hippocampus of rats, it was found that the [[CA1 neuron|CA1]] and [[CA3 region|CA3]] [[pyramidal cell]]s continued to be active and of the same volume. However, the number of [[granule cell]]s of the [[dentate gyrus]] continuously decreased with age; the function of these cells also declined leading Carol and her team to conclude these gyrus cells are the weak link of the hippocampal circuit involved in memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Carol A.|date=2011-10-03|title=Secrets of aging: What does a normally aging brain look like?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3186042/|journal=F1000 Biology Reports|volume=3|doi=10.3410/B3-22|issn=1757-594X|pmc=3186042|pmid=22003369}}</ref>\n\nA few of Barnes\u2019s latest research publication was published in 2017 are:\u00a0 \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016643281630420X Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in the macaque monkeys]\u201d, \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174334 Evidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus]\u201d, and \u201c[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317305615 The aging navigational system]\u201d.\n\n=== Primate Research ===\n[[File:Brain_regions_involved_in_memory_formation.jpg|thumb|Brain regions involved in memory formation]]\nIn addition to work on rodent models, Dr. Barnes has helped advance the field of normative aging research using nonhuman primate models, specifically [[Macaque|macaque monkeys]].\u00a0 Primarily, Barnes\u2019 early work in macaques helped to tie together neurobiological data collected from rodents and functional imaging data from older humans. In the paper \u201c[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848213/ Memory impairment in aged primates is associated with region-specific network dysfunction]\u201d Barnes and her team showed that older monkeys had significant impairment on object recognition. In addition, older monkeys displayed a lower density of inhibitory somatostatin positive [[interneuron]]s in the [[CA3 region|CA3]] sub-region of the [[hippocampus]]. These [[interneuron]]s are responsible for regulating the activity of excitatory neurons in the [[hippocampus]]. With less [[interneuron]] density, the baseline firing rate of [[CA3 region|CA3]] excitatory neurons was elevated. This finding relates to the increased hippocampal activity shown in imaging studies of older human adults. Both a decrease in [[interneuron]] density and increase baseline firing rates in the [[hippocampus]] have been associated with poor cognition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Barnes|first2=Carol A.|date=2019-12-26|title=Experiments in macaque monkeys provide critical insights into age-associated changes in cognitive and sensory function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6936691/|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=116|issue=52|pages=26247\u201326254|doi=10.1073/pnas.1902279116|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6936691|pmid=31871147}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in the paper \u201cEvidence for an evolutionarily conserved memory coding scheme in the mammalian hippocampus\u201d Dr. Barnes and her team found evidence that all mammals require the same quantity of neurons in the hippocampus to encode memory of a single experience. This finding suggests that tall mammals use a stable amount of neurons to encode a similar virtual reality experience. However, due to variable hippocampus size, the proportion of neurons used for the encoding of experience differ. Rodents have the smallest [[hippocampus]] and thus use 40% of their [[hippocampus]] neurons for encoding, nonhuman primates have larger hippocampus and use 4%, and finally humans have the largest [[hippocampus]] and use an estimated 2.5% for experiential encoding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wixted|first=John T.|last2=Goldinger|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Squire|first3=Larry R.|last4=Kuhn|first4=Joel R.|last5=Papesh|first5=Megan H.|last6=Smith|first6=Kris A.|last7=Treiman|first7=David M.|last8=Steinmetz|first8=Peter N.|date=2018-01-30|title=Coding of episodic memory in the human hippocampus|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/115/5/1093|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=115|issue=5|pages=1093\u20131098|doi=10.1073/pnas.1716443115|issn=0027-8424|pmid=29339476|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nDr. Barnes has also done research to see how executive function changes with normative aging. [[Executive functions]] are the higher order process humans take part in such as attention, decision making, impulse control, and emotional control. These functions are mediated by the activity of the [[Prefrontal cortex|Prefrontal Cortex]]. Once again studying [[macaque]]s, Barnes and her team focused on two aspects of executive function, attentional monitoring and updating as well as [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]]. Attentional monitoring and updating allow for behavior changes with corresponding rule changes. For example, when two options are presented one is the correct choice initially; however, when the correct choice changes to the second option, attentional monitoring and updating help correct for the rule change and alter behavior in order to choose correctly. The change in behavior is mediated through a process of trial and error, which helps associate the right choice with certain behaviors. Barnes and her team found that older monkeys needed a greater number of trials to accurately account for a rule change. Suggesting, the executive system behind attentional monitoring and updating is impaired with aging. Secondly, [[Cognitive flexibility|set shifting]] is the ability to unconsciously shift attention between tasks while maintaining accuracy. In her research, Barnes presented macaque monkeys with an object recognition test of previously learned objects. She then presented interfering objects which required shifts between the object choice and evaluation of novel objects. Her results showed that older monkeys performed better on object recognition with this interference than younger monkeys. Thus set shifting abilities seem to be maintained if not enhanced with aging. The most important discovery out of these studies, however, is that the two aspects of executive function, monitoring and updating and set shifting, were shown to be independent systems that are affected differently with age. Thus, Barnes and her team suggest that changes in the [[Prefrontal cortex|Prefrontal Cortex]] can result from aging but different sub-regions within it show different patterns of aging.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Daniel T.|last2=Smith|first2=Anne C.|last3=Burke|first3=Sara N.|last4=Gazzaley|first4=Adam|last5=Barnes|first5=Carol A.|date=2017-03-30|title=Attentional updating and monitoring and affective shifting are impacted independently by aging in macaque monkeys|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493156/|journal=Behavioural brain research|volume=322|issue=Pt B|pages=329\u2013338|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2016.06.056|issn=0166-4328|pmc=5493156|pmid=27368416}}</ref>\n\nA final research contribution of Carol A Barnes involves the study of spatial networks and spatial memories in aging [[macaque]]s. Barnes and her team studied brain activity in four different conditions for movement: cages, sitting, walking on a treadmill, and freely walking in space. The study found that younger macaques have distinct spatial networks for all four distinct conditions. However, older monkeys displayed less discrete activity of spatial networks. Meaning, all conditions evoked activation of the same undifferentiated network. This finding suggests dynamic network changes as a possible explanation for spatial cognition deficits. In other words, the spatial processing networks become less precise with age and may contribute to spatial memory loss or confusion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Engle|first=James R.|last2=Machado|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Permenter|first3=Michele R.|last4=Vogt|first4=Julie A.|last5=Maurer|first5=Andrew P.|last6=Bulleri|first6=Alicia M.|last7=Barnes|first7=Carol A.|date=2016-11-30|title=Network Patterns Associated with Navigation Behaviors Are Altered in Aged Nonhuman Primates|url=https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/48/12217|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=36|issue=48|pages=12217\u201312227|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4116-15.2016|issn=0270-6474|pmid=27903730|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Family ==\nBarnes interest of normative aging in the brain stems from her grandfather when she and her family noticed that his memory was declining.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sherva|first=Kara|date=2015|title=Carol Barnes: A Prominent Voice in the Neuroscience of Aging, and a Proponent of Women in Neuroscience|url=https://soundideas.pugetsound.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=soundneuroscience|journal=Sound Neuroscience: An Undergraduate Neuroscience Journal|volume=2|pages=|via=}}</ref> Furthermore, Barnes is included in the [https://neurotree.org/beta/tree.php?pid=547 Neuroscience Academic Family Tree] .
