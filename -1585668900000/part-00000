The project centred around live cookery, with the team in character, talking to the public and sharing with them recipes from the era. It was initially led by food historian [http://www.anniegray.co.uk Annie Gray], and then by experienced historical interpreter and educator, Kathy Hipperson. Initially, recipes were sourced from books appropriate to the era, but in 2009 Benjamin Stride's descendant Robert Stride bought tickets to see a concert at Audley End. The name sparked a memory, and he realised that he had Avis's hand-written recipe book in a drawer. He donated it to [[English Heritage]], and the costumed team were able to integrate the recipes written by Avis into their work. The book also enabled Gray to work more closely on the sources available to Crocombe, and the style of cookery likely to have been seen at Audley in the 1880s.

The traveller is then passed to a new scam artist who offers to show the foreign traveller the sights. Scam artists also offer cheap lodgings and meals to foreign travellers so they can place him or her in the scam artist's physical custody and thus make the foreigner vulnerable to threats and physical coercion. In the process, the foreigner loses his passport.<ref name=\"TRAVEL \"/>\n\nBesides these, there are also unofficial guides to watch out for. They can be found all over India such as at crowded transportation hubs and at tourist attractions. A common ruse at transportation hubs is to claim that there is no train to your destination or to claim that a place is closed. The aim is to get you to take their expensive private transport or to an expensive hotel where they get a cut. As for the guides at tourist attractions, these could be temples, mosques, or places such as the Varanasi Ghat. You will end up receiving unsolicited services and then asked to pay a big tip for them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://travelscams.org/asia/india/|title=42 Tourist targeted scams in India|website=Travelscams.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref>\n\n===Taxi scam===\nThere are also taxi scams present in India, whereby a foreign traveller, who is not aware of the locations around Indian airports, is taken for a ride round the whole airport and charged for full-fare taxi ride while the terminal is only few hundred yards away.<ref name=\"REPORT \"/> Overseas Security Advisory Council in a report mentioned the process about how to avoid taxi-scam.
