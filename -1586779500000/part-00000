It depicts the 64-year-old [[President of the United States]] during his final year in office. The portrait was a gift to former [[British Prime Minister]] [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne]], and spent more than 170 years in England.\n\nStuart painted three copies of the Lansdowne, and five portraits that were closely related to it.<ref name=\"Lansdowne\"/>{{rp|175}} The most famous of the copies is in the [[East Room]] of the [[White House]]. Numerous other artists also have painted copies.\n\nTo preclude the original portrait's possible sale at auction, the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, D.C. purchased it in 2001 for $20,000,000.<ref name=\"Kilian\">Michael Kilian, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2001-03-14-0103140255-story.html \"Timely Donation Saves Portrait of Washington from the Auction Block,\"] ''The Chicago Tribune'', March 14, 2001.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe Lansdowne portrait likely (and fancifully) depicts President Washington's December 7, 1795 annual address to the [[4th United States Congress|Fourth U.S. Congress]].<ref name=\"Lansdowne\"/>{{rp|172}} The highly-unpopular [[Jay Treaty]], settling claims between the United States and Great Britain left over from the Revolutionary War, had been presented for approval to the U.S. Senate earlier in the year. The Senate held a special session to debate the treaty in June, at which opposition to it had been fierce. Only two-thirds of the 30 senators (the minimum required under the U.S. Constitution) approved the treaty in mid-August, and Washington, who strongly supported the treaty, signed it in late August.<ref name=\"Lansdowne\"/>{{rp|172}} In his annual address to Congress, on the opening day of its next session, President Washington acknowledged the struggle over the treaty and called for unity.<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29437 George Washington - Seventh Annual Address to Congress], from The American Presidency Project.</ref> The portrait's paper, pen and inkwell may allude to his signing of the treaty.<ref name=\"Lansdowne\"/>{{rp|172}} There was lingering resentment in the House of Representatives, which expressed its displeasure by declining to appropriate funding for the treaty's implementation until April 1796.<ref name=\"Miles lecture\">Ellen G.

Miles has a theory as to why Charles Cotesworth Pinckney commissioned and paid for a copy of the Lansdowne portrait, but never retrieved it from Gilbert Stuart's studio.<br>[[James Monroe]] was Minister to France in 1795, when the Jay Treaty was signed. France was then at war with Great Britain, and despite his best efforts, Monroe could not convince the French government that this was a benign treaty and would not affect Franco-American relations. President Washington recalled Monroe, and nominated Pinckney as his successor. Pinckney was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in September 1796, and arrived in Paris in November.<br>The [[French Directory]] refused to accept Pinckney's credentials, and negotiations between the countries broke down when French officials demanded a substantial bribe to do so, in what became known as the [[XYZ Affair]].<br>Miles's theory is that Pinckney's copy of the Lansdowne portrait was intended as a diplomatic gift from the U.S. to France. Pinckney's deliberate humiliation and the suspension of diplomatic relations between the countries (for nearly 5 years) caused those plans (and the portrait) to be abandoned.<br>Supporting evidence for the diplomatic gift theory is that Pinckney later sought reimbursement from Secretary of State Timothy Pickering for the $500 that he had paid to Stuart for the portrait.<ref name=\"Miles lecture\"/>}} Pinckney paid for but never retrieved his copy of the portrait from Stuart's studio, and the artist seems to have resold it to Baker by December 1797.<ref name=\"Stretch\">Bonnie Barrett Stretch, \"The White House Washington, If Stuart Didn't Paint It, Who Did?\" ''ArtNews'', October 1, 2004.[http://www.artnews.com/2004/10/01/the-white-house-washington/]</ref>\n\n==Provenance==\n<blockquote>After the death of Lord Lansdowne, his pictures were sold by auction. The ''Washington'' was purchased by Samuel Williams, an English {{sic}} merchant, for $2,000. Williams subsequently became insolvent, and his creditors disposed of the ''Washington'' by a lottery. Forty tickets were sold, at fifty guineas each. The picture fell to Mr. J. Delaware Lewis, a nephew of Mr. William D. Lewis, of Philadelphia. But few Americans had ever seen the picture, and Mr. William D. Lewis, who was Chairman of the Committee on Art, obtained the loan of it from his nephew for the [[1876 Centennial Exposition|Centennial Exhibition]]. It was sent out with the loan collection from England, unpacked at [[Memorial Hall (Philadelphia)|Memorial Hall]], and hung up in the British section before its arrival was known to the Fine Arts Committee. An effort was subsequently made to have it transferred to the American section, but it was unsuccessful.

The House mace was a bundle of tied reeds topped with a [[bald eagle]], an American symbol.]]\n[[File:Gilbert Stuart - George Washington (detail of book labels) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Detail of the book bindings in the White House's copy of the Lansdowne portrait. \"UNITED STATES\" is spelled as \"UNITED SATES\" to distinguish the copy.]]\nThe painting is full of symbolism, drawn from American and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] symbols of the [[Roman Republic]]. Stuart painted Washington from life, showing him standing up, dressed in a black [[velvet]] suit with an outstretched hand held up in an [[Eloquence|oratorical]] manner. Behind Washington is a row of two [[Doric column]]s, with another row to the left. Wrapped around and between the columns are red tasseled drapes.\n\nWashington's suit is plain and simple, and the [[sword]] he holds on his left side is a dress sword and not a battle sword (symbolizing a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[form of government]], rather than a [[monarchy]] or [[military dictatorship]]). In the sky, storm clouds appear on the left while a [[rainbow]] appears on the right, signifying the [[American Revolutionary War]] giving way to the peace and prosperity of the new [[United States]] after the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. The medallion at the top of the chair shows the red, white, and blue colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].\n\nOn and under the tablecloth-draped table to the left are two [[book]]s: ''Federalist''&mdash;probably a reference to the ''[[Federalist Papers]]''&mdash;and ''Journal of Congress''&mdash;the ''[[Congressional Record]]''. Another five books are under the table: the three to the right are ''General Orders'', ''American Revolution'', and ''Constitutional Bylaws''&mdash;symbolizing Washington's leadership as [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Continental Army]] and [[President of the Continental Congress|president]] of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]].\n\nThe [[pen]] and [[paper]] on the table signify the [[rule of law]]. The table's leg is shaped like a [[fasces]], an ancient Roman symbol of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[authority]] (''[[imperium]]''). On the far left of the table is a [[silver]] [[inkwell]], emblazed with [[Coat of Arms of George Washington|George Washington's coat of arms]] (see [[Syng inkstand]]). A white [[quill]] rests upon silver [[dog]]s, ancient symbols of [[loyalty]]. Behind these on the table is a large black [[hat]].\n\nWashington's unusually clenched [[facial expression]] comes from his famous [[Dentures|false teeth]]. [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]]'s [[marble]] [[sculpture]] of Washington shows a more natural expression. Stuart wrote: \"When I painted him [Washington], he had just had a set of false teeth inserted, which accounts for the constrained expression so noticeable about the mouth and lower part of the face ... Houdon's [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] does not suffer from this defect.\"\n\n==Alternate versions==\n===Constable-Hamilton portrait===\nStuart painted a 1797 seated portrait of Washington, based on the Lansdowne.

France was then at war with Great Britain, and despite his best efforts, Monroe could not convince the French government that this was a benign treaty and would not affect Franco-American relations. President Washington recalled Monroe, and nominated Pinckney as his successor. Pinckney was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in September 1796, and arrived in Paris in November.<br>The [[French Directory]] refused to accept Pinckney's credentials, and negotiations between the countries broke down when French officials demanded a substantial bribe to do so, in what became known as the [[XYZ Affair]].<br>Miles's theory is that Pinckney's copy of the Lansdowne portrait was intended as a diplomatic gift from the U.S. to France. Pinckney's deliberate humiliation and the suspension of diplomatic relations between the countries (for nearly 5 years) caused those plans (and the portrait) to be abandoned.<br>Supporting evidence for the diplomatic gift theory is that Pinckney later sought reimbursement from Secretary of State Timothy Pickering for the $500 that he had paid to Stuart for the portrait.<ref name=\"Miles lecture\"/>}} Pinckney paid for but never retrieved his copy of the portrait from Stuart's studio, and the artist seems to have resold it to Baker by December 1797.<ref name=\"Stretch\">Bonnie Barrett Stretch, \"The White House Washington, If Stuart Didn't Paint It, Who Did?\" ''ArtNews'', October 1, 2004.[http://www.artnews.com/2004/10/01/the-white-house-washington/]</ref>\n\n==Provenance==\n<blockquote>After the death of Lord Lansdowne, his pictures were sold by auction.

Forty tickets were sold, at fifty guineas each. The picture fell to Mr. J. Delaware Lewis, a nephew of Mr. William D. Lewis, of Philadelphia. But few Americans had ever seen the picture, and Mr. William D. Lewis, who was Chairman of the Committee on Art, obtained the loan of it from his nephew for the [[1876 Centennial Exposition|Centennial Exhibition]]. It was sent out with the loan collection from England, unpacked at [[Memorial Hall (Philadelphia)|Memorial Hall]], and hung up in the British section before its arrival was known to the Fine Arts Committee. An effort was subsequently made to have it transferred to the American section, but it was unsuccessful.

The House mace was a bundle of tied reeds topped with a [[bald eagle]], an American symbol.]]\n[[File:Gilbert Stuart - George Washington (detail of book labels) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Detail of the book bindings in the White House's copy of the Lansdowne portrait. \"UNITED STATES\" is spelled as \"UNITED SATES\" to distinguish the copy.]]\nThe painting is full of symbolism, drawn from American and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] symbols of the [[Roman Republic]]. Stuart painted Washington from life, showing him standing up, dressed in a black [[velvet]] suit with an outstretched hand held up in an [[Eloquence|oratorical]] manner. Behind Washington is a row of two [[Doric column]]s, with another row to the left. Wrapped around and between the columns are red tasseled drapes.\n\nWashington's suit is plain and simple, and the [[sword]] he holds on his left side is a dress sword and not a battle sword (symbolizing a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[form of government]], rather than a [[monarchy]] or [[military dictatorship]]). In the sky, storm clouds appear on the left while a [[rainbow]] appears on the right, signifying the [[American Revolutionary War]] giving way to the peace and prosperity of the new [[United States]] after the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. The medallion at the top of the chair shows the red, white, and blue colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].\n\nOn and under the tablecloth-draped table to the left are two [[book]]s: ''Federalist''&mdash;probably a reference to the ''[[Federalist Papers]]''&mdash;and ''Journal of Congress''&mdash;the ''[[Congressional Record]]''. Another five books are under the table: the three to the right are ''General Orders'', ''American Revolution'', and ''Constitutional Bylaws''&mdash;symbolizing Washington's leadership as [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Continental Army]] and [[President of the Continental Congress|president]] of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]].\n\nThe [[pen]] and [[paper]] on the table signify the [[rule of law]]. The table's leg is shaped like a [[fasces]], an ancient Roman symbol of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[authority]] (''[[imperium]]''). On the far left of the table is a [[silver]] [[inkwell]], emblazed with [[Coat of Arms of George Washington|George Washington's coat of arms]] (see [[Syng inkstand]]). A white [[quill]] rests upon silver [[dog]]s, ancient symbols of [[loyalty]]. Behind these on the table is a large black [[hat]].\n\nWashington's unusually clenched [[facial expression]] comes from his famous [[Dentures|false teeth]]. [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]]'s [[marble]] [[sculpture]] of Washington shows a more natural expression. Stuart wrote: \"When I painted him [Washington], he had just had a set of false teeth inserted, which accounts for the constrained expression so noticeable about the mouth and lower part of the face ... Houdon's [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] does not suffer from this defect.\"\n\n==Alternate versions==\n===Constable-Hamilton portrait===\nStuart painted a 1797 seated portrait of Washington, based on the Lansdowne.
