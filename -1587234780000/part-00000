It had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 27, 2019. It was released in the United States on May 17, 2019, by [[A24 (company)|A24]], and in the United Kingdom on August 30, 2019, by [[Curzon Artificial Eye]]. The film is a [[semi-autobiographical]] account of Hogg's experiences at film school. \n\n==Premise==\nByrne stars as Julie, a young wealthy woman attending film school who meets and develops an increasingly destructive relationship with a secretive older man who encourages her ambition. The title refers to the painting of the same name by [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]], which is featured in the film.\n\n==Plot==\nJulie, a film student, intends to make a movie about a boy, his mother, and their life in the city of [[Sunderland]]. She lives in a flat with another student and his girlfriend. She meets Anthony, a well-to-do-man who works at the Foreign Office, who moves in with her after her roommate moves out. He leaves a postcard with a picture of the girl in \"The Souvenir.\" He later takes her to the gallery where the painting is hung. Julie says the girl looks sad, while Anthony says she looks determined.\n\nAnthony has to travel to Paris but returns with some lingerie, which he asks Julie to put on. While they are in bed, she notices some needle marks on his arm but doesn't know what they are, and he continues to ask Julie for money regularly. Julie starts to pay for their restaurant bills and is forced to borrow money from her parents. \n\nJulie and Anthony have dinner with two of Anthony's friends, who reveal to Julie during a moment alone that Anthony is a habitual heroin user. Julie is taken aback but does not mention anything to Anthony.\n\nAnthony explains over a meal at Harrods that he has had relationships with three other girls, including trips to Venice with at least one of them, who appears to have committed suicide while on the trip. He invites Julie to go to Venice with him.\n\nOne evening, she returns to find her apartment has been broken into, and her valuable jewelry is missing. Later, on their trip to Venice, Anthony admits to doing it but didn't tell her to keep her from feeling bad. Julie becomes upset, but Anthony manages to convince her he had a good reason for doing so even though he doesn't elaborate on it, insinuating it is related to work and not to his heroin habit. Julie starts noticing when Anthony is on heroin, and she attends a self-help group. She starts to confront him some but doubts herself, and he manipulates and gaslights her. She begins to take on the responsibility of his addiction.\n\nOne evening, Julie returns home to find a strange man in her apartment that Anthony must have let in. She also catches an illness from what she's being exposed to through Anthony. Finally, after finding out he was arrested, Julie asks Anthony to move out.\n\nJulie begins to put herself back together after the breakup, to the happiness of her friends and professors. Barbara, Anthony's mother, continues to call Julie to try to find him.\n\nThey meet again, and Anthony appears clean long enough for Julie to invite him back in with her, though he soon goes through withdrawal in front of her. Soon though, he starts using again. Anthony goes missing but is later found dead, having overdosed in a public toilet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Honor Swinton Byrne]] as Julie\n* [[Tom Burke (actor)|Tom Burke]] as Anthony\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Rosalind\n* [[Richard Ayoade]] as Patrick\n* Jaygann Ayeh as Marland\n* [[Jack McMullen]] as Jack\n* Hannah Ashby Ward as Tracey\n* Frankie Wilson as Frankie\n* Barbara Peirson as Anthony's Mother\n* James Dodds as Anthony\u2019s Father\n* [[Ariane Labed]] as Garance\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 27, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/2019-sundance-film-festival-competition-program-features-lineup-1203038417/|title=Sundance Film Festival Unveils 2019 Features Lineup|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Peter|last=Debruge|date=November 28, 2018|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}</ref> [[A24 (company)|A24]] and [[Curzon Artificial Eye]] acquired U.S. and U.K. distribution rights to the film, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/12/a24-acquires-joanna-hoggs-sundance-bound-the-souvenir-1202512944/|title=A24 Acquires Joanna Hogg's Sundance-Bound 'The Souvenir'|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=December 3, 2018|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/joanna-hoggs-the-souvenir-secures-uk-and-ireland-deal-exclusive/5136382.article|title=Joanna Hogg's 'The Souvenir' secures UK and Ireland deal (exclusive)|website=[[Screen International]]|first=Tom|last=Grater|date=January 31, 2019|accessdate=February 19, 2019}}</ref> It was released in the United States on May 17, 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/the-souvenir-trailer-joanna-hogg-honor-swinton-byrne-1202045054/|title=The Souvenir' Trailer: Discover the Power of Joanna Hogg's Sundance Darling|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Zack|last=Sharf|date=February 19, 2019|accessdate=February 19, 2019}}</ref> and in the United Kingdom on August 30, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.curzonartificialeye.com/the-souvenir/|title=The Souvenir|website=[[Curzon Artificial Eye]]|accessdate=June 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received critical acclaim upon its premiere.

Burke]], and [[Tilda Swinton]]. It had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 27, 2019. It was released in the United States on May 17, 2019, by [[A24 (company)|A24]], and in the United Kingdom on August 30, 2019, by [[Curzon Artificial Eye]]. The film is a [[semi-autobiographical]] account of Hogg's experiences at film school. \n\n==Premise==\nByrne stars as Julie, a young wealthy woman attending film school who meets and develops an increasingly destructive relationship with a secretive older man who encourages her ambition. The title refers to the painting of the same name by [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]], which is featured in the film.\n\n==Plot==\nJulie, a film student, intends to make a movie about a boy, his mother, and their life in the city of [[Sunderland]]. She lives in a flat with another student and his girlfriend. She meets Anthony, a well-to-do-man who works at the Foreign Office, who moves in with her after her roommate moves out. He leaves a postcard with a picture of the girl in \"The Souvenir.\" He later takes her to the gallery where the painting is hung. Julie says the girl looks sad, while Anthony says she looks determined.\n\nAnthony has to travel to Paris but returns with some lingerie, which he asks Julie to put on. While they are in bed, she notices some needle marks on his arm but doesn't know what they are, and he continues to ask Julie for money regularly. Julie starts to pay for their restaurant bills and is forced to borrow money from her parents. \n\nJulie and Anthony have dinner with two of Anthony's friends, who reveal to Julie during a moment alone that Anthony is a habitual heroin user. Julie is taken aback but does not mention anything to Anthony.\n\nAnthony explains over a meal at Harrods that he has had relationships with three other girls, including trips to Venice with at least one of them, who appears to have committed suicide while on the trip. He invites Julie to go to Venice with him.\n\nOne evening, she returns to find her apartment has been broken into, and her valuable jewelry is missing. Later, on their trip to Venice, Anthony admits to doing it but didn't tell her to keep her from feeling bad. Julie becomes upset, but Anthony manages to convince her he had a good reason for doing so even though he doesn't elaborate on it, insinuating it is related to work and not to his heroin habit. Julie starts noticing when Anthony is on heroin, and she attends a self-help group. She starts to confront him some but doubts herself, and he manipulates and gaslights her. She begins to take on the responsibility of his addiction.\n\nOne evening, Julie returns home to find a strange man in her apartment that Anthony must have let in. She also catches an illness from what she's being exposed to through Anthony. Finally, after finding out he was arrested, Julie asks Anthony to move out.\n\nJulie begins to put herself back together after the breakup, to the happiness of her friends and professors. Barbara, Anthony's mother, continues to call Julie to try to find him.\n\nThey meet again, and Anthony appears clean long enough for Julie to invite him back in with her, though he soon goes through withdrawal in front of her. Soon though, he starts using again. Anthony goes missing but is later found dead, having overdosed in a public toilet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Honor Swinton Byrne]] as Julie\n* [[Tom Burke (actor)|Tom Burke]] as Anthony\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Rosalind\n* [[Richard Ayoade]] as Patrick\n* Jaygann Ayeh as Marland\n* [[Jack McMullen]] as Jack\n* Hannah Ashby Ward as Tracey\n* Frankie Wilson as Frankie\n* Barbara Peirson as Anthony's Mother\n* [[James Dodds]] as Anthony\u2019s Father\n* [[Ariane Labed]] as Garance\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 27, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/2019-sundance-film-festival-competition-program-features-lineup-1203038417/|title=Sundance Film Festival Unveils 2019 Features Lineup|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Peter|last=Debruge|date=November 28, 2018|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}</ref> [[A24 (company)|A24]] and [[Curzon Artificial Eye]] acquired U.S. and U.K. distribution rights to the film, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/12/a24-acquires-joanna-hoggs-sundance-bound-the-souvenir-1202512944/|title=A24 Acquires Joanna Hogg's Sundance-Bound 'The Souvenir'|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=December 3, 2018|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/joanna-hoggs-the-souvenir-secures-uk-and-ireland-deal-exclusive/5136382.article|title=Joanna Hogg's 'The Souvenir' secures UK and Ireland deal (exclusive)|website=[[Screen International]]|first=Tom|last=Grater|date=January 31, 2019|accessdate=February 19, 2019}}</ref> It was released in the United States on May 17, 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/the-souvenir-trailer-joanna-hogg-honor-swinton-byrne-1202045054/|title=The Souvenir' Trailer: Discover the Power of Joanna Hogg's Sundance Darling|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Zack|last=Sharf|date=February 19, 2019|accessdate=February 19, 2019}}</ref> and in the United Kingdom on August 30, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.curzonartificialeye.com/the-souvenir/|title=The Souvenir|website=[[Curzon Artificial Eye]]|accessdate=June 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received critical acclaim upon its premiere.

The place-name is now usually pronounced 'Wivvenho', but the Essex accent would traditionally have rendered it as 'Wivvenhoo'. According to folk etymology, the name derived from \"Wyvernhoe\",<ref name=\"callaghan\">{{cite web|last1=Callaghan|first1=Victor|title=Wivenhoe, UK|url=http://victor.callaghan.info/time/wivenhoe/|website=Prof Vic Callaghan|accessdate=5 April 2016|quote=Another charming aspect of Wivenhoe is its name, which is so strikingly unusual as to beg the question of where it came from and what it means? Like a lot of history, its a mix of fact and opinion. It seems undisputed that \"Hoe\" is derived from the Saxon word meaning a spur of land jutting out into water (the River Colne in this case); just look at the map below to see that spur sticking out into the estuary! That being so, the meaning of \"Wiven\" is less certain being, to some extent, \"lost in the mists of time\"!  While many are persuaded by the argument that \"Wiven\" is a variation of \"Wifa\", a proper name associated with a tribe or individual called \"Wifa\" that may have lived in this area sometime after the Romans left and before the Normans arrived, there are other opinions. One of the most charming is that  'Wiven' is more likely to be a variation of the word Wyvern which is a \"winged two-footed dragon\".  Arguments in favour of this explanation seem to be based on two ideas; first that the notion of correct spelling is relatively new and early written language was simply a somewhat inconsistent phonetic interpretation of spoken sounds, and phonetically, Wyvern and Wiven are more closely related to each other than Wifa. Second, they argue that, after the failed uprising against the Romans by the Celts in the Eastern region\u2026 many locals fled to Wales where the word Wyvern (dragon) remains popular.}}</ref> originating from the mythical beast called a [[wyvern]] and the previously mentioned ridge (hoe).

The place-name is now usually pronounced 'Wivvenho', but the Essex accent would traditionally have rendered it as 'Wivvenhoo'. According to folk etymology, the name derived from \"Wyvernhoe\",<ref name=\"callaghan\">{{cite web|last1=Callaghan|first1=Victor|title=Wivenhoe, UK|url=http://victor.callaghan.info/time/wivenhoe/|website=Prof Vic Callaghan|accessdate=5 April 2016|quote=Another charming aspect of Wivenhoe is its name, which is so strikingly unusual as to beg the question of where it came from and what it means? Like a lot of history, its a mix of fact and opinion. It seems undisputed that \"Hoe\" is derived from the Saxon word meaning a spur of land jutting out into water (the River Colne in this case); just look at the map below to see that spur sticking out into the estuary! That being so, the meaning of \"Wiven\" is less certain being, to some extent, \"lost in the mists of time\"!  While many are persuaded by the argument that \"Wiven\" is a variation of \"Wifa\", a proper name associated with a tribe or individual called \"Wifa\" that may have lived in this area sometime after the Romans left and before the Normans arrived, there are other opinions. One of the most charming is that  'Wiven' is more likely to be a variation of the word Wyvern which is a \"winged two-footed dragon\".  Arguments in favour of this explanation seem to be based on two ideas; first that the notion of correct spelling is relatively new and early written language was simply a somewhat inconsistent phonetic interpretation of spoken sounds, and phonetically, Wyvern and Wiven are more closely related to each other than Wifa. Second, they argue that, after the failed uprising against the Romans by the Celts in the Eastern region\u2026 many locals fled to Wales where the word Wyvern (dragon) remains popular.}}</ref> originating from the mythical beast called a [[wyvern]] and the previously mentioned ridge (hoe).
