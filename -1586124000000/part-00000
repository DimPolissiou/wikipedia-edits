As a music executive, he heads his own record label, [[Cashville Records]], and is formerly a member of the hip hop groups [[G-Unit]] and [[UTP (group)|UTP Playas]]. WIKIPEDIA IS A DISGRACE.\n\n==Early life==\nAround the age of 12, Brown began rapping. A few years later, he performed for [[Birdman (rapper)|Brian \"Baby\" Williams]], co-founder of [[Cash Money Records|Cash Money]]. After several years on and off of Cash Money, Brown and fellow rapper [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]] decided to leave the label for good in 2000<ref name=\"allhiphop1\">{{cite web|author=Ace Cannon and BUCK |url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2008/01/27/19198560.aspx |title=AHH Stray News: Young Buck Back With Cash Money? |publisher=AllHipHop.com |date=2008-01-27 |accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref> and go to UTP, where Brown stayed until 2003.\n\nOne of his early appearances was on the song \"Memphis,\" where he was featured along with [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[Project Pat]], and other southern rappers. His deal with UTP later led to a meeting with New York rapper [[50 Cent]], who later signed him to [[G-Unit Records]], under [[Interscope]].\n\n==Music career==\n===Cash Money Records===\nYoung Buck would get his first major deal with [[Cash Money Records|Ca$h Money]] in 1995 when he was given an opportunity to perform with \"[[Birdman (rapper)|Baby]]\", co-founder of Cash Money. Young Buck, soon after, would tour with Birdman on the road and do several shows together. Even though Young Buck was signed with the label, he never appeared on any of their albums or released his own under the label.  After several years of being on and off Cash Money, Buck and fellow rapper [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]] decided to leave the label in late 2001<ref name=\"allhiphop1\"/> where he would join Juvenile's record label UTP and the rap group [[UTP (group)|UTP Playas]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn late 2011, it was rumoured that Young Buck was close to resigning with Cash Money again, but the deal crumbled when the judge in Young Buck's bankruptcy case decided to switch his 's case from a reorganization to a liquidation was frustrating the Young Buck's attempts to sign with Cash Money Records and end a contract dispute with [[G-Unit Records]] that stifled his career since 2008. Judge George C. Paine II signed an order converting the case from Chapter 11 reorganization to Chapter 7 liquidation on Wednesday December 21, 2011 and Young Buck, whose real name is David Darnell Brown, stood to lose more than anticipated. The trustee administering his estate has said she plans to sell the trademarked \"Young Buck\" moniker itself along with other assets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Langhorne |first=Cyrus |url=http://www.sohh.com/2011/12/young_bucks_money_problems_delay_cash_mo.html |title=Young Buck's Money Problems Delay Cash Money Record Deal |publisher=Sohh.Com |date=2011-12-22 |accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref> However, on January 9, 2012, Cash Money Records CEO, Birdman, stepped forward to address the rumors and speculation suggesting Tennessee rapper Young Buck and West Coast hip-hop artist [[Lil B]] were on the verge of joining his team.

His deal with UTP later led to a meeting with New York rapper [[50 Cent]] who later signed Buck to [[G-Unit Records]], under [[Interscope Records]]. Buck would release 2 albums ''[[Born To Be A Thug (album)|Born To Be A Thug]]'' & ''[[The Compilation (UTP album)|The Compilation]]'' with UTP before leaving the label and rap group in 2003 to join 50 Cent's record label G-Unit Records and the rap group [[G-Unit]].\n\n===G-Unit Records===\n[[File:GUnitBKK.JPG|thumb|Young Buck (second from right) in 2006]]\nAfter leaving UTP Records in 2003, Young Buck would link up with up and coming rap titan [[50 Cent]] who was already making waves with his outfit [[G-Unit]]. Looking to broaden his empire, 50 Cent was quick to sign Young Buck to his G-Unit imprint and also welcome him as one of the newest members of the rap group G-Unit.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nYoung Buck would first begin his career with G-Unit Records in 2003 when the rap group G-Unit released their first album ''[[Beg for Mercy (G-Unit album)|Beg for Mercy]]''. As the album was recorded, [[Tony Yayo]] was sentenced to jail on charges of gun possession, and so makes only two appearances on the entire record, on the tracks \"Groupie Love\" and \"I Smell Pussy\". His image is seen on the brick wall of the album cover because he could not be photographed due to the jail sentence. At the time of the album's release, rapper [[Game (rapper)|The Game]] was not in G-Unit therefore he is not photographed nor does he make an appearance on the album. He does, however, make cameos in the videos for [[Stunt 101]], [[Wanna Get To Know You]], and [[Poppin' Them Thangs]]. He was further mentioned in Poppin' Them Thangs when Young Buck states \"You ain't no [[Crips|Crip]] like [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop]] you ain't no [[Bloods|Blood]] like Game\". In its first week of sales, ''Beg for Mercy'' sold 377,000 copies, placing third behind [[Tupac Shakur]]'s eighth posthumous release, ''[[Tupac: Resurrection (soundtrack)|Tupac: Resurrection]]'', which moved 430,000 albums, and [[Jay Z|Jay-Z]]'s ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]'', which sold 463,263 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/3860/article-1G1-111615257/jayz-back-black-album-bows-no-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611193205/http://business.highbeam.com/3860/article-1G1-111615257/jayz-back-black-album-bows-no-1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-06-11 |title=Jay-Z's back in 'Black' as album bows at No. 1.('The Black Album' debuts at top of charts) &#124; HighBeam Business: Arrive Prepared |publisher=Business.highbeam.com |date=2003-11-20 |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref> It sold 327,000 copies in its second week to peak at number 2 on the Billboard 200,<ref>{{cite web|last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480826/20031126/spears_britney.jhtml |title=Britney Moans Her Way To The Top Of The Albums Chart - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=2003-11-26 |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref> and 193,000 in its third week.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480914/20031203/jay_z.jhtml |title=Jay-Z's Farewell Album Hasn't Said Goodbye To The #1 Slot - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=2003-12-03 |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref> It has now sold 2.7 million units in the U.S.<ref>Crosley, Hillary (April 24, 2008).

The singles from this album include \"[[Let Me In (Young Buck song)|Let Me In]]\", \"[[Shorty Wanna Ride]]\", and \"Look at Me Now\". It features a lot of rappers outside of [[G-Unit]] such as [[Lil' Flip]], [[David Banner]], D-Tay, [[Ludacris]], Game, [[Stat Quo]] and production from [[Lil Jon]], [[Kon Artis]], and more. The album received very little promotion after November because of the [[Young Buck#VIBE Awards incident|VIBE award incident]], after which Young Buck was arrested for assault. Though the case was dropped it had been four months since Young Buck himself had promoted the album. The album debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with about 361,000 copies sold, in the first week, and has since been certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the RIAA.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH Searchable Database] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |date=June 26, 2007 }}.

Accessed August 24, 2007.</ref>\n\nFollowing his debut album, Buck would join forces with the rest of the G-Unit roster at the time to release a collaboration album ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (soundtrack)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'' in 2005, soon after Bucks second album ''[[Buck The World]]'' in 2007 would follow. Before the departure of Young Buck the highly publicised feud between G Unit and their former west coast counterpart Game had split the fanbase of the outfit in two with many fans taking sides with the [[Compton, California|Compton]] native. As the feud between G Unit and Young Buck was simmering behind the scenes 50 Cent released a phone call he had taped between him and Young Buck in which an emotional Buck was heard crying and asking 50 Cent for help and advice. Buck would take this personal and release several tracks towards 50 Cent and G-Unit.  Buck is still signed and legally obligated to release a studio album via G-Unit Records.\n\nIn August 2012, Buck stated in an interview with XXL he was no longer signed to G-Unit Records and he would be a free agent when he is released from prison.<ref name=\"xxlmag.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/features/2012/08/young-buck-talks-50-cent-moving-forward-with-his-career-life/ |title=Young Buck Talks 50 Cent & Moving Forward With His Career & Life &#124; XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=2012-08-07 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Solo career===\nAfter Buck was dismissed from the group for multiple reasons, he released numerous tracks attacking 50 Cent, G-Unit and their associates. 50 Cent and G-Unit also responded with many tracks, including one particular instance in which 50 Cent released a phone call he had recorded with Young Buck, which featured the Tennessee native weeping and apologizing for numerous things.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapbasement.com/audio/50-cent-young-buck-phone-call-part-1.html|title=50 Cent & Young Buck - Phone Call (Part 1) - Rap Basement|work=Rap Basement|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref> After this happened, Young Buck responded, stating that the call was a fake, that happened one year prior to its release, and claimed that only police record phone calls.<ref name=\"phoneleak\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1589572/20080618/young_buck.jhtml|title=Young Buck Responds To 50 Cent\u2019s Leaked Phone Call In New Dis Track \u2014 Listen To It Here!|work=MTV News|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter a lengthy battle between Young Buck and his former G-Unit comrades, the feud seemed to settle down, with Young Buck stating that he owed one more album for G-Unit Records which would be released in 2009, then titled ''The Rehab''.<ref name=\"young-buck-rehab\">Shaheem Reid (October 21, 2008) [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1597630/20081021/young_buck.jhtml Young Buck Says The Rehab Will Sell A Million In A Week] [[MTV]].com Accessed January 19, 2009.</ref> In other interviews, he's stated that he does not have a problem with 50 Cent or G-Unit anymore, but is currently doing his \"own thing\".

Young Buck, soon after, would tour with Birdman on the road and do several shows together. Even though Young Buck was signed with the label, he never appeared on any of their albums or released his own under the label.  After several years of being on and off Cash Money, Buck and fellow rapper [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]] decided to leave the label in late 2001<ref name=\"allhiphop1\"/> where he would join Juvenile's record label UTP and the rap group [[UTP (group)|UTP Playas]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn late 2011, it was rumoured that Young Buck was close to resigning with Cash Money again, but the deal crumbled when the judge in Young Buck's bankruptcy case decided to switch his 's case from a reorganization to a liquidation was frustrating the Young Buck's attempts to sign with Cash Money Records and end a contract dispute with [[G-Unit Records]] that stifled his career since 2008. Judge George C. Paine II signed an order converting the case from Chapter 11 reorganization to Chapter 7 liquidation on Wednesday December 21, 2011 and Young Buck, whose real name is David Darnell Brown, stood to lose more than anticipated.

His deal with UTP later led to a meeting with New York rapper [[50 Cent]] who later signed Buck to [[G-Unit Records]], under [[Interscope Records]]. Buck would release 2 albums ''[[Born To Be A Thug (album)|Born To Be A Thug]]'' & ''[[The Compilation (UTP album)|The Compilation]]'' with UTP before leaving the label and rap group in 2003 to join 50 Cent's record label G-Unit Records and the rap group [[G-Unit]].\n\n===G-Unit Records===\n[[File:GUnitBKK.JPG|thumb|Young Buck (second from right) in 2006]]\nAfter leaving UTP Records in 2003, Young Buck would link up with up and coming rap titan [[50 Cent]] who was already making waves with his outfit [[G-Unit]]. Looking to broaden his empire, 50 Cent was quick to sign Young Buck to his G-Unit imprint and also welcome him as one of the newest members of the rap group G-Unit.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nYoung Buck would first begin his career with G-Unit Records in 2003 when the rap group G-Unit released their first album ''[[Beg for Mercy (G-Unit album)|Beg for Mercy]]''. As the album was recorded, [[Tony Yayo]] was sentenced to jail on charges of gun possession, and so makes only two appearances on the entire record, on the tracks \"Groupie Love\" and \"I Smell Pussy\". His image is seen on the brick wall of the album cover because he could not be photographed due to the jail sentence. At the time of the album's release, rapper [[Game (rapper)|The Game]] was not in G-Unit therefore he is not photographed nor does he make an appearance on the album. He does, however, make cameos in the videos for [[Stunt 101]], [[Wanna Get To Know You]], and [[Poppin' Them Thangs]].

The singles from this album include \"[[Let Me In (Young Buck song)|Let Me In]]\", \"[[Shorty Wanna Ride]]\", and \"Look at Me Now\". It features a lot of rappers outside of [[G-Unit]] such as [[Lil' Flip]], [[David Banner]], D-Tay, [[Ludacris]], Game, [[Stat Quo]] and production from [[Lil Jon]], [[Kon Artis]], and more. The album received very little promotion after November because of the [[Young Buck#VIBE Awards incident|VIBE award incident]], after which Young Buck was arrested for assault. Though the case was dropped it had been four months since Young Buck himself had promoted the album. The album debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with about 361,000 copies sold, in the first week, and has since been certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the RIAA.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH Searchable Database] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |date=June 26, 2007 }}.

Before the departure of Young Buck the highly publicised feud between G Unit and their former west coast counterpart Game had split the fanbase of the outfit in two with many fans taking sides with the [[Compton, California|Compton]] native. As the feud between G Unit and Young Buck was simmering behind the scenes 50 Cent released a phone call he had taped between him and Young Buck in which an emotional Buck was heard crying and asking 50 Cent for help and advice. Buck would take this personal and release several tracks towards 50 Cent and G-Unit.

After releasing a string of mixtapes in the early 2000s, including [[50 Cent is the Future]], [[God's Plan (album)|God's Plan]] and [[No Mercy, No Fear]], the group released their debut album ''[[Beg for Mercy]]'' in 2003, which went on to ship over 4,000,000 copies in the US and was certified [[RIAA certification|Quadruple Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The album, which followed the critical and commercial success of 50 Cent's major-label debut ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'', served as a platform for Lloyd Banks, Young Buck and Tony Yayo to release their respective solo debut albums; ''[[The Hunger for More]]'' (2004), ''[[Straight Outta Cashville]]'' (2004) and ''[[Thoughts of a Predicate Felon]]'' (2005). In 2008, the group released their second album ''[[T\u00b7O\u00b7S (Terminate on Sight)]]''.\n \nDuring Tony Yayo's imprisonment in 2003, the group recruited Tennessee-based rapper [[Young Buck]], who was featured throughout the ''Beg for Mercy'' album. [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] was also added to the group, a proposition made by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Jimmy Iovine]] in late 2003, to promote the [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]]/[[Interscope Records|Interscope]] newcomer. However, due to The Game's \"disloyalty\" in the eyes of 50 Cent, he was soon removed from the group in March 2005. In April 2008, 50 Cent revealed Young Buck was no longer a part of the group due to his \"excessive spending\" and \"inconsistent behavior\". In early 2014, after Yayo and 50 Cent separately stated G-Unit was no more, the original members of the group reconciled and reunited at [[Summer Jam#Summer Jam 2014|Summer Jam 2014]], along with Young Buck after his six-year departure from the group. [[G-Unit Records]] artist [[Kidd Kidd]] was also added to the group upon its reformation. The group released their first collaborative project in six years, an EP titled ''[[The Beauty of Independence]]'' in August of the same year.\n\nIn April 2018, Kidd Kidd announced he was leaving both the group and G-Unit Records to become independent.<ref name=\"xxlmag.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/video/2018/04/kidd-kidd-departure-g-unit/|title=Kidd Kidd Leaves G-Unit to Find Success on His Own - XXL|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref> In June of the same year, 50 Cent announced Lloyd Banks had left the group, leaving himself and Tony Yayo as the remaining members of G-Unit.<ref>http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.47242/title.50-cent-announces-lloyd-banks-exit-from-g-unit-records</ref> WIKIPEDIA IS A DISGRACE.\n\n== History ==\n===Formation and early years (1999\u201302) ===\n\nThe group's founding members, [[50 Cent]], [[Lloyd Banks]] and [[Tony Yayo]] were all born and raised in [[South Jamaica]], a section of the [[Queens, New York|Queens]] borough of [[New York City]], and began rapping together as teenagers.<ref>[http://www.g-unitsoldier.com/main.html Tony Yayo, in an interview, explains their past].

Their plan was to market The Game as a devotee, or a loyal member of 50 Cent's \"camp\". The Game made his first appearances as a member of G-Unit on Lloyd Banks and Young Buck's debut albums, [[The Hunger for More]] and [[Straight Outta Cashville]]. Throughout 2004, The Game began working on his debut studio album, which was set to be executive produced by 50 Cent and [[Dr. Dre]]. In November 2004, the album's second single, [[How We Do (song)|How We Do]] featuring 50 Cent became a top 5 hit, as did the album's third single, [[Hate It or Love It]], which peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], being held back from the top spot by 50 Cent's single, [[Candy Shop]] featuring [[Olivia (singer)|Olivia]]. Beginning in 2004, tensions began to rise between 50 Cent and The Game, and shortly after the release of [[The Documentary]], tensions escalated into a full-scale feud which led to 50 Cent announcing that The Game had been kicked out of G-Unit, with 50 Cent claiming he had not received full credit for writing 6 songs from The Documentary.<ref name=\"MTV-The Game\">Reid, Shaheem (February 28, 2005).

Ja Rule eventually tried to squash the feud with 50 Cent by using minister [[Louis Farrakhan]] in a televised interview. However, the attempt at peace lost credibility as the interview was scheduled a day before ''Blood in My Eye'' was released. As a result, most fans, along with 50 Cent, dismissed the interview as a blatant publicity stunt. Because of the ongoing feud between the two, 50 Cent's labelmates [[Eminem]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Obie Trice]], [[D12]] and [[Busta Rhymes]] have also become involved and have also released tracks which insult Ja Rule.\n\nJa Rule later released ''[[R.U.L.E.]]'' with the successful single, \"New York\", featuring [[Jadakiss]] and Fat Joe in which Ja Rule took subliminal shots at 50 Cent. This single prompted 50 Cent to enter a feud with the two featured artists (see article on \"[[Piggy Bank (song)|Piggy Bank]]\" for details).\n\nAlthough it seemed that the feud was over, Ja Rule returned with a track entitled \"21 Gunz\".<ref>IllSeed.

In light of the 2012 BET Awards Kay Slay decided to get 50 Cent to do a verse for it and put his on his mixtape ''The Rise Of A City''. Although Fat Joe was unaware Kay Slay was putting 50 Cent on his track he approved stating unity is good for hip-hop.\nThat same year, Tony Yayo shouted out Fat Joe, saying that there was \"no beef\".\n\n===Cam'ron===\nA feud between 50 Cent and [[Cam'ron]] began when 50 Cent was on [[WQHT|Hot 97]] giving an interview and [[Cam'ron]] called in.<ref name=\"50 Cent & Cam\u2019ron Argument\">{{YouTube|1DtTNKIBnjo|50 Cent on Angie Martinez Show}}, YouTube.

As the conversation escalated into an argument, 50 Cent called Koch Records the \"industry graveyard\".<ref name=\"50 Cent & Cam\u2019ron Argument\"/> Cam'ron pointed out that [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]]' newest album sold just as much as [[Lloyd Banks]]' album did, despite the fact that Dipset is on an independent label while G-Unit is on a major label. 50 Cent took offense to this and said that Lloyd Banks has more money than [[Lil Wayne]] and [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]], which makes record sales irrelevant. Cam'ron became upset and rebutted 50 Cent's statements. Most notably, he brought up the poor record sales of the [[Mobb Deep]] album, ''[[Blood Money (Mobb Deep album)|Blood Money]]''. Eventually the debate became so heated that the radio station was forced to end the call.<ref name=\"50 Cent & Cam\u2019ron Argument\"/> On February 9, 2007, the video of 50 Cent's \"Funeral Music\" premiered on [[DJ Kay Slay]]'s Myspace. The video attacked the leader of [[Dipset]]. This is not seen as an attack on other members of Dipset, as 50 Cent says \"From now on, [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jimmy]]'s the boss of Dipset. And [[Juelz Santana|Juelz]] is the [[Caporegime|Capo]]. Cam is demoted to soldier. We like Jimmy better anyway\". At the end of the video, there is a poster showing a fictional drawing of Cam'ron with a gun saying \"50 Cent\" on the burial, along with his date of death; being February 8 when the video was released. Cam'ron responded with a track called \"Curtis\", titled after 50 Cent's first name, Where he claims he enjoys 50 Cent's shoutouts to Dipset members Juelz Santana and Jim Jones, then goes on to discuss Santana's and Jim Jones' sales on their recent albums. 50 Cent and Young Buck made the song \"Hold On\" together with a video in which 50 Cent takes shots at Cam'ron. Cam'ron responded with \"Curtis Pt.2\", which he shot a video for. 50 Cent and Cam'ron ended their feud in 2016.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main article|G-Unit discography}}\n;Studio albums\n*''[[Beg for Mercy]]'' (2003)\n*''[[T\u00b7O\u00b7S (Terminate on Sight)]]'' (2008)\n\n;EPs\n*''[[The Beauty of Independence]]'' (2014)\n*''[[The Beast Is G Unit]]'' (2015)\n\n==Awards==\n*'''Vibe Awards'''\n**2004 - Best Group of The Decade<ref>[http://www.livedaily.com/news/7341.html G-Unit rapper accused of stabbing at Vibe awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113191351/http://livedaily.com/news/7341.html |date=2010-01-13 }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In an episode of the [[MTV]] [[claymation|clay animated]] show [[Celebrity Deathmatch]], entitled \"Where's Lohan?\", depicted a fight to the death between 50 Cent and The Game.

After releasing a string of mixtapes in the early 2000s, including [[50 Cent is the Future]], [[God's Plan (album)|God's Plan]] and [[No Mercy, No Fear]], the group released their debut album ''[[Beg for Mercy]]'' in 2003, which went on to ship over 4,000,000 copies in the US and was certified [[RIAA certification|Quadruple Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The album, which followed the critical and commercial success of 50 Cent's major-label debut ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'', served as a platform for Lloyd Banks, Young Buck and Tony Yayo to release their respective solo debut albums; ''[[The Hunger for More]]'' (2004), ''[[Straight Outta Cashville]]'' (2004) and ''[[Thoughts of a Predicate Felon]]'' (2005). In 2008, the group released their second album ''[[T\u00b7O\u00b7S (Terminate on Sight)]]''.\n \nDuring Tony Yayo's imprisonment in 2003, the group recruited Tennessee-based rapper [[Young Buck]], who was featured throughout the ''Beg for Mercy'' album. [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] was also added to the group, a proposition made by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Jimmy Iovine]] in late 2003, to promote the [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]]/[[Interscope Records|Interscope]] newcomer. However, due to The Game's \"disloyalty\" in the eyes of 50 Cent, he was soon removed from the group in March 2005. In April 2008, 50 Cent revealed Young Buck was no longer a part of the group due to his \"excessive spending\" and \"inconsistent behavior\". In early 2014, after Yayo and 50 Cent separately stated G-Unit was no more, the original members of the group reconciled and reunited at [[Summer Jam#Summer Jam 2014|Summer Jam 2014]], along with Young Buck after his six-year departure from the group. [[G-Unit Records]] artist [[Kidd Kidd]] was also added to the group upon its reformation.

Ja Rule eventually tried to squash the feud with 50 Cent by using minister [[Louis Farrakhan]] in a televised interview. However, the attempt at peace lost credibility as the interview was scheduled a day before ''Blood in My Eye'' was released. As a result, most fans, along with 50 Cent, dismissed the interview as a blatant publicity stunt. Because of the ongoing feud between the two, 50 Cent's labelmates [[Eminem]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Obie Trice]], [[D12]] and [[Busta Rhymes]] have also become involved and have also released tracks which insult Ja Rule.\n\nJa Rule later released ''[[R.U.L.E.]]'' with the successful single, \"New York\", featuring [[Jadakiss]] and Fat Joe in which Ja Rule took subliminal shots at 50 Cent. This single prompted 50 Cent to enter a feud with the two featured artists (see article on \"[[Piggy Bank (song)|Piggy Bank]]\" for details).\n\nAlthough it seemed that the feud was over, Ja Rule returned with a track entitled \"21 Gunz\".<ref>IllSeed.

Eventually the debate became so heated that the radio station was forced to end the call.<ref name=\"50 Cent & Cam\u2019ron Argument\"/> On February 9, 2007, the video of 50 Cent's \"Funeral Music\" premiered on [[DJ Kay Slay]]'s Myspace. The video attacked the leader of [[Dipset]]. This is not seen as an attack on other members of Dipset, as 50 Cent says \"From now on, [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jimmy]]'s the boss of Dipset. And [[Juelz Santana|Juelz]] is the [[Caporegime|Capo]]. Cam is demoted to soldier. We like Jimmy better anyway\". At the end of the video, there is a poster showing a fictional drawing of Cam'ron with a gun saying \"50 Cent\" on the burial, along with his date of death; being February 8 when the video was released. Cam'ron responded with a track called \"Curtis\", titled after 50 Cent's first name, Where he claims he enjoys 50 Cent's shoutouts to Dipset members Juelz Santana and Jim Jones, then goes on to discuss Santana's and Jim Jones' sales on their recent albums. 50 Cent and Young Buck made the song \"Hold On\" together with a video in which 50 Cent takes shots at Cam'ron. Cam'ron responded with \"Curtis Pt.2\", which he shot a video for. 50 Cent and Cam'ron ended their feud in 2016.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main article|G-Unit discography}}\n;Studio albums\n*''[[Beg for Mercy]]'' (2003)\n*''[[T\u00b7O\u00b7S (Terminate on Sight)]]'' (2008)\n\n;EPs\n*''[[The Beauty of Independence]]'' (2014)\n*''[[The Beast Is G Unit]]'' (2015)\n\n==Awards==\n*'''Vibe Awards'''\n**2004 - Best Group of The Decade<ref>[http://www.livedaily.com/news/7341.html G-Unit rapper accused of stabbing at Vibe awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113191351/http://livedaily.com/news/7341.html |date=2010-01-13 }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In an episode of the [[MTV]] [[claymation|clay animated]] show [[Celebrity Deathmatch]], entitled \"Where's Lohan?\", depicted a fight to the death between 50 Cent and The Game.

XLIX</ref>]]\n[[File:Birth and throne names of Shoshenq I.jpg|thumb|Birth and throne names of Shoshenq I]]\n\nThe conventional dates for his reign as established by [[Kenneth Kitchen]] are 945&ndash;924 BC but his time-line has recently been revised upwards by a few years to 943&ndash;922 BC, since he may well have lived for up to two to three years after his successful campaign in [[Canaan]],{{dubious|Why use \"Canaan\" and not the Israelite kingdoms?|date=July 2019}} conventionally dated to 925 BC. As Edward Wente of the University of Chicago noted on page 276 of his JNES 35(1976) Book Review of Kitchen's study of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]], there is \"no certainty\" that Shoshenq's 925 BC campaign terminated just prior to this king's death a year later in 924 BC. The English Egyptologist, Morris Bierbrier also dated Shoshenq I's accession \"between 945\u2013940 BC\" in his seminal 1975 book concerning the genealogies of Egyptian officials who served during the late New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period.<ref>M. Bierbrier, ''The Late New Kingdom in Egypt (c. 1300\u2013664 BC)'', Aris & Philips Ltd (1975), p. 111</ref> Bierbrier based his opinion on Biblical evidence collated by W. Albright in a [[BASOR]] 130 paper. This development would also account for the mostly unfinished state of decorations of Shoshenq's building projects at the Great Temple of Karnak where only scenes of the king's Palestinian military campaign are fully carved. Building materials would first have had to be extracted and [[architectural plan]]ning performed for his great monumental projects here. Such activities usually took up to a year to complete before work was even begun. This would imply that Shoshenq I likely lived for a period in excess of one year after his 925 BC campaign. On the other hand, if the Karnak inscription was concurrent with Shoshenq's campaign into Canaan, the fact that it was left unfinished would suggest this campaign occurred in the last year of Shoshenq's reign. This possibility would also permit his 945 BC accession date to be slightly lowered to 943 BC.\n\nThe most recent and comprehensive study of Ancient Egyptian chronology affirms the theory that Shoshenq I came to power in 943 BC rather than 945 BC as is conventionally assumed based on epigraphic evidence from the Great Dakhla stela, which dates to Year 5 of his reign.<ref>Rolf Krauss, Das wr\u015d-Datum aus Jahr 5 von Shoshenq [I], Discussions in Egyptology 62 (2005), pp.43-48</ref> The editors of the 2006 book ''Ancient Egyptian Chronology'' write:\n\n<blockquote>The chronology of early Dyn. 22 depends on dead reckoning. The sum of the highest attested regnal dates for Osorkon II, Takelot I, Osorkon I, and Shoshenq I, added to 841 BC as year 1 of Shoshenq III, yields 938 BC at the latest for year 1 of Shoshenq I...[However] The large Dakhla stela provides a lunar date in the form of a ''wr\u0161'' feast in year 5 of Shoshenq [I], yielding 943 BC as his year 1.<ref>Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss & David Warburton (editors), Ancient Egyptian Chronology (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill: 2006, p.474</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Year 5 ''wr\u0161'' feast is recorded to have been celebrated at Dakhla oasis on IV [[Peret]] day 25 and Krauss' exploration of the astronomical data leads him to conclude that the only 'fit' within the period of 950 to 930 BC places the accession of Shoshenq I between December 944 and November 943 BC\u2014or 943 BC for the most part.<ref>Anthony Leahy, The date of the 'larger' Dakhleh stela (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum 1894.107a), GM 226 (2010), p.47</ref> However, Dr. Anthony Leahy has suggested that \"the identification of the ''wr\u0161''-festival of [[Seth]] as [a] lunar [festival] is hypothetical, and [thus] its occurrence on the first day of a lunar month an assumption. Neither has been proven incontrovertibly.\"<ref>Leahy, GM 226 p.52</ref> Thus far, however, only Dr. Kenneth Kitchen is on record as sharing the same academic view.<ref>see 'The Libyan Period in Egypt.'

Significantly, his uncle [[Osorkon the Elder]] had already served on the throne for at least six years in the preceding 21st Dynasty; hence, Shoshenq I's rise to power was not wholly unexpected. As king, Shoshenq chose his eldest son, Osorkon I, as his successor and consolidated his authority over Egypt through marriage alliances and appointments. He assigned his second son, [[Iuput|Iuput A]], the prominent position of [[High Priest of Amun]] at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as well as the title of Governor of Upper Egypt and Commander of the Army to consolidate his authority over the Thebaid.<ref>K.A.

This is attested, in part, by the discovery of a statue base bearing his name from the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] city of [[Byblos]], part of a monumental [[stela]] from [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]] bearing his name, and a list of cities in the region comprising [[Syria]], [[Philistia]], [[Phoenicia]], the [[Negev]], and the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], among various topographical lists inscribed on the walls of temples of Amun at [[al-Hibah]] and [[Karnak]].

His list focuses on places either north or south of Judah, as if he did not raid the center. The fundamental problem facing historians is establishing the aims of the two accounts and linking up the information in them.<ref>{{cite book|last=de Mieroop|first=Marc Van|title=A History of Ancient Egypt|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=9781405160711|pages=400}}</ref>\n\nThere have been some possible suggestions and proposals from scholars regarding this issue. Some argue that the mention of Jerusalem was erased from the list over time. Others believe that [[Rehoboam]]'s tribute to Shoshenq saved the city from destruction and therefore from the Bubastite Portal's lists. Some scholars even propose that Shoshenq claimed a conquest that he did not enact and copied the list of conquered territories from an old Pharaoh's conquest list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/hebrew-bible/did-pharaoh-sheshonq-attack-jerusalem/ |title=Did Pharaoh Sheshonq Attack Jerusalem |author=Biblical Archaeology Society Staff |date=27 March 2017 |website=Biblical History Daily |publisher=Biblical Archaeology Society |access-date=3 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs an addendum to his foreign policy, Shoshenq I carved a report of campaigns in Nubia and Israel, with a detailed list of conquests in Israel.

According to the British [[List of Egyptologists|Egyptologist]] [[Aidan Dodson]], no trace has yet been found of the tomb of Shoshenq I; the sole funerary object linked to Shoshenq I is a [[canopic chest]] of unknown provenance that was donated to the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]] (\u00c4MB 11000) by Julius Isaac in 1891.<ref>Aidan Dodson, ''The Canopic Equipment of the Kings of Egypt'', Kegan Paul Intl, (1994), pp.83-84</ref> This may indicate his tomb was looted in antiquity, but this hypothesis is unproven. Egyptologists differ over the location of Shoshenq I's burial and speculate that he may have been buried somewhere in [[Tanis]]\u2014perhaps in one of the anonymous royal tombs here\u2014or in [[Bubastis]]. However, Troy Sagrillo in a [https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa11757 GM 205] (2005) paper observes that \"there are only a bare handful of inscribed blocks from Tanis that might name the king (i.e., Shoshenq I) and none of these come from an ''in situ'' building complex contemporary with his reign.\"<ref>Troy Leiland Sagrillo, \"[https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa11757 ''The Mummy of Shoshenq I Re-discovered?''],\" [[G\u00f6ttinger Miszellen]] 205 (2005), p.99</ref> Hence, it is more probable that Shoshenq was buried in another city in the Egyptian Delta. Sagrillo offers a specific location for Shoshenq's burial\u2014the [[Memphis, Egypt#Great Temple of Ptah|Ptah temple enclosure of Memphis]]\u2014and notes that this king built:\n{{quote|fairly widely in the area, undoubtedly including a [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]] and forecourt at the Ptah temple (Kitchen, TIPE 1996, pp. 149\u2013150) ...It is, therefore, not completely improbable that he (i.e., Shoshenq I) built his tomb in the region. The funerary cult surrounding his \"House of Millions of Years of Shoshenq, Beloved of Amun\" was functioning several generations after its establishment at the temple (Ibrahem Aly Sayed 1996, p. 14). The \"House of Millions of Years of Shoshenq, Beloved of Amun\" was probably the forecourt and pylon of the Ptah temple, which, if the royal necropoleis at Tanis, Sa\u00efs, and Mendes are taken as models, could very well have contained a royal burial within it or the ''temenos''.<ref name=\"Sagrillo, p.100\">Sagrillo, p. 100</ref>}}\n\nSagrillo concludes by observing that if Shoshenq I's burial place was located at Memphis, \"it would go far in explaining why this king's funerary cult lasted for some time at the site after his death.\"<ref name=\"Sagrillo, p.100\"/>\n\nWhile Shoshenq's tomb is currently unknown, the burial of one of his prominent state officials at Thebes, the Third Prophet of Amun [[Djedptahiufankh]], was discovered intact in tomb [[DB320]] in the 19th Century. Inscriptions on Djedptahiufankh's Mummy bandages show that he died in or after Year 11 of this king. His mummy was discovered to contain various gold bracelets, amulets and precious [[carnelian]] objects and give a small hint of the vast treasures that would have adorned Shoshenq I's tomb.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* M.

As Edward Wente of the University of Chicago noted on page 276 of his JNES 35(1976) Book Review of Kitchen's study of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]], there is \"no certainty\" that Shoshenq's 925 BC campaign terminated just prior to this king's death a year later in 924 BC. The English Egyptologist, Morris Bierbrier also dated Shoshenq I's accession \"between 945\u2013940 BC\" in his seminal 1975 book concerning the genealogies of Egyptian officials who served during the late New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period.<ref>M. Bierbrier, ''The Late New Kingdom in Egypt (c. 1300\u2013664 BC)'', Aris & Philips Ltd (1975), p. 111</ref> Bierbrier based his opinion on Biblical evidence collated by W. Albright in a [[BASOR]] 130 paper. This development would also account for the mostly unfinished state of decorations of Shoshenq's building projects at the Great Temple of Karnak where only scenes of the king's Palestinian military campaign are fully carved. Building materials would first have had to be extracted and [[architectural plan]]ning performed for his great monumental projects here. Such activities usually took up to a year to complete before work was even begun. This would imply that Shoshenq I likely lived for a period in excess of one year after his 925 BC campaign. On the other hand, if the Karnak inscription was concurrent with Shoshenq's campaign into Canaan, the fact that it was left unfinished would suggest this campaign occurred in the last year of Shoshenq's reign. This possibility would also permit his 945 BC accession date to be slightly lowered to 943 BC.\n\nThe most recent and comprehensive study of Ancient Egyptian chronology affirms the theory that Shoshenq I came to power in 943 BC rather than 945 BC as is conventionally assumed based on epigraphic evidence from the Great Dakhla stela, which dates to Year 5 of his reign.<ref>Rolf Krauss, Das wr\u015d-Datum aus Jahr 5 von Shoshenq [I], Discussions in Egyptology 62 (2005), pp.43-48</ref> The editors of the 2006 book ''Ancient Egyptian Chronology'' write:\n\n<blockquote>The chronology of early Dyn. 22 depends on dead reckoning. The sum of the highest attested regnal dates for Osorkon II, Takelot I, Osorkon I, and Shoshenq I, added to 841 BC as year 1 of Shoshenq III, yields 938 BC at the latest for year 1 of Shoshenq I...[However] The large Dakhla stela provides a lunar date in the form of a ''wr\u0161'' feast in year 5 of Shoshenq [I], yielding 943 BC as his year 1.<ref>Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss & David Warburton (editors), Ancient Egyptian Chronology (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill: 2006, p.474</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Year 5 ''wr\u0161'' feast is recorded to have been celebrated at Dakhla oasis on IV [[Peret]] day 25 and Krauss' exploration of the astronomical data leads him to conclude that the only 'fit' within the period of 950 to 930 BC places the accession of Shoshenq I between December 944 and November 943 BC\u2014or 943 BC for the most part.<ref>Anthony Leahy, The date of the 'larger' Dakhleh stela (Oxford, Ashmolean Museum 1894.107a), GM 226 (2010), p.47</ref> However, Dr. Anthony Leahy has suggested that \"the identification of the ''wr\u0161''-festival of [[Seth]] as [a] lunar [festival] is hypothetical, and [thus] its occurrence on the first day of a lunar month an assumption.

Significantly, his uncle [[Osorkon the Elder]] had already served on the throne for at least six years in the preceding 21st Dynasty; hence, Shoshenq I's rise to power was not wholly unexpected. As king, Shoshenq chose his eldest son, Osorkon I, as his successor and consolidated his authority over Egypt through marriage alliances and appointments. He assigned his second son, [[Iuput|Iuput A]], the prominent position of [[High Priest of Amun]] at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as well as the title of Governor of Upper Egypt and Commander of the Army to consolidate his authority over the Thebaid.<ref>K.A.

Some argue that the mention of Jerusalem was erased from the list over time. Others believe that [[Rehoboam]]'s tribute to Shoshenq saved the city from destruction and therefore from the Bubastite Portal's lists.

According to the British [[List of Egyptologists|Egyptologist]] [[Aidan Dodson]], no trace has yet been found of the tomb of Shoshenq I; the sole funerary object linked to Shoshenq I is a [[canopic chest]] of unknown provenance that was donated to the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]] (\u00c4MB 11000) by Julius Isaac in 1891.<ref>Aidan Dodson, ''The Canopic Equipment of the Kings of Egypt'', Kegan Paul Intl, (1994), pp.83-84</ref> This may indicate his tomb was looted in antiquity, but this hypothesis is unproven. Egyptologists differ over the location of Shoshenq I's burial and speculate that he may have been buried somewhere in [[Tanis]]\u2014perhaps in one of the anonymous royal tombs here\u2014or in [[Bubastis]]. However, Troy Sagrillo in a [https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa11757 GM 205] (2005) paper observes that \"there are only a bare handful of inscribed blocks from Tanis that might name the king (i.e., Shoshenq I) and none of these come from an ''in situ'' building complex contemporary with his reign.\"<ref>Troy Leiland Sagrillo, \"[https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa11757 ''The Mummy of Shoshenq I Re-discovered?''],\" [[G\u00f6ttinger Miszellen]] 205 (2005), p.99</ref> Hence, it is more probable that Shoshenq was buried in another city in the Egyptian Delta. Sagrillo offers a specific location for Shoshenq's burial\u2014the [[Memphis, Egypt#Great Temple of Ptah|Ptah temple enclosure of Memphis]]\u2014and notes that this king built:\n{{quote|fairly widely in the area, undoubtedly including a [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]] and forecourt at the Ptah temple (Kitchen, TIPE 1996, pp. 149\u2013150) ...It is, therefore, not completely improbable that he (i.e., Shoshenq I) built his tomb in the region. The funerary cult surrounding his \"House of Millions of Years of Shoshenq, Beloved of Amun\" was functioning several generations after its establishment at the temple (Ibrahem Aly Sayed 1996, p. 14). The \"House of Millions of Years of Shoshenq, Beloved of Amun\" was probably the forecourt and pylon of the Ptah temple, which, if the royal necropoleis at Tanis, Sa\u00efs, and Mendes are taken as models, could very well have contained a royal burial within it or the ''temenos''.<ref name=\"Sagrillo, p.100\">Sagrillo, p. 100</ref>}}\n\nSagrillo concludes by observing that if Shoshenq I's burial place was located at Memphis, \"it would go far in explaining why this king's funerary cult lasted for some time at the site after his death.\"<ref name=\"Sagrillo, p.100\"/>\n\nWhile Shoshenq's tomb is currently unknown, the burial of one of his prominent state officials at Thebes, the Third Prophet of Amun [[Djedptahiufankh]], was discovered intact in tomb [[DB320]] in the 19th Century. Inscriptions on Djedptahiufankh's Mummy bandages show that he died in or after Year 11 of this king. His mummy was discovered to contain various gold bracelets, amulets and precious [[carnelian]] objects and give a small hint of the vast treasures that would have adorned Shoshenq I's tomb.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* M.

{"title_page": "Currency in circulation", "text_new": "{{Finance sidebar}}\nIn [[donald trump likes chapoti jaydev brendnen m cola loco intersjate]], the '''currency in circulation''' in a country is the value of \n[[currency]] or [[cash]] (banknotes and coins) that has ever been issued by the country\u2019s [[monetary authority]] less the amount that has been removed. More broadly, '''money in circulation''' is the total [[money supply]] of a country, which can be defined in various ways, but always includes currency and also some types of [[bank deposits]], such as deposits at call.\n\nThe published amount of currency in circulation tends to be overstated by an unknown amount because it does not take into account money that has been destroyed, or held by individuals as a form of security (the proverbial \u201cmoney under the mattress\u201d), or by [[Coin collecting|coin collectors]], domestic or foreign, or which is held in reserve within the banking system, including currency held by foreign [[central bank]]s as a [[foreign exchange reserve]] asset.\n\n==Domestic demand for currency ==\nThe currency in circulation in a country is entirely based on the need or demand for cash in the community. Each country\u2019s monetary authority is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient money in circulation to meet the commercial needs of the economy and releases additional notes and coins when there is a demand for them. \n\nBanks would routinely or exceptionally order cash from the monetary authority to meet anticipated demand, and keep it in reserve in the bank. (The banking regulator would typically determine the banks\u2019 [[reserve requirement]]s, including the minimum proportion of a bank\u2019s assets that banks must hold in cash.) When banks no longer believe they need as much cash in reserve they would return the cash to the monetary authority.<ref name=\"ebr\">{{cite book |title=Economics: Theory and Practice |last=Welch |first=Patrick J. |author2=Gerry F.

(The amount taken out of reserve is available for lending, at interest.)  The amount of money needed to be at call varies because of a number of factors. For example, there is a higher demand at Christmas time when [[commerce|commercial]] activity is highest. Also, when workers were paid in cash, there was a higher demand for pay-day. There may also be sudden, unexpected surges in demand for cash by individuals during economic panics, which may result in a \u201c[[Bank run|run on the bank]]\u201d as individuals seek to withdraw money from bank accounts. Cash held by banks is counted as part of the currency in circulation.\n\nCash that is in the hands of individuals and businesses in the community may be needed for routine or exceptional purchases or held in reserve. Nowadays, a large part of every day [[Financial transaction|transaction]]s are effected using [[electronic funds transfer]]s, without the use of cash. When a business makes a cash sale, it will keep the cash it receives until it itself pays it to someone else or deposits it into a bank account, keeping part of it in its \u201cfloat\u201d, being the cash needed in order to give a change to customers. A significant part of the cash in circulation is used by and held within the [[Black market|black economy]].\n\n==Foreign currency reserves==\nCentral banks of many countries hold currency of another country in their [[foreign exchange reserves]], which can include banknotes, deposits, bonds, treasury bills and other government securities. The cash component is counted by the issuing central bank as part of its currency in circulation.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of money}}\nThe American colonies or states governments were able to circulate [[Bill of credit|bills of credit]].

More broadly, '''money in circulation''' is the total [[money supply]] of a country, which can be defined in various ways, but always includes currency and also some types of [[bank deposits]], such as deposits at call.\n\nThe published amount of currency in circulation tends to be overstated by an unknown amount because it does not take into account money that has been destroyed, or held by individuals as a form of security (the proverbial \u201cmoney under the mattress\u201d), or by [[Coin collecting|coin collectors]], domestic or foreign, or which is held in reserve within the banking system, including currency held by foreign [[central bank]]s as a [[foreign exchange reserve]] asset.\n\n==Domestic demand for currency ==\nThe currency in circulation in a country is entirely based on the need or demand for cash in the community. Each country\u2019s monetary authority is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient money in circulation to meet the commercial needs of the economy and releases additional notes and coins when there is a demand for them. \n\nBanks would routinely or exceptionally order cash from the monetary authority to meet anticipated demand, and keep it in reserve in the bank. (The banking regulator would typically determine the banks\u2019 [[reserve requirement]]s, including the minimum proportion of a bank\u2019s assets that banks must hold in cash.) When banks no longer believe they need as much cash in reserve they would return the cash to the monetary authority.<ref name=\"ebr\">{{cite book |title=Economics: Theory and Practice |last=Welch |first=Patrick J. |author2=Gerry F.

(The amount taken out of reserve is available for lending, at interest.)  The amount of money needed to be at call varies because of a number of factors. For example, there is a higher demand at Christmas time when [[commerce|commercial]] activity is highest. Also, when workers were paid in cash, there was a higher demand for pay-day. There may also be sudden, unexpected surges in demand for cash by individuals during economic panics, which may result in a \u201c[[Bank run|run on the bank]]\u201d as individuals seek to withdraw money from bank accounts. Cash held by banks is counted as part of the currency in circulation.\n\nCash that is in the hands of individuals and businesses in the community may be needed for routine or exceptional purchases or held in reserve. Nowadays, a large part of every day [[Financial transaction|transaction]]s are effected using [[electronic funds transfer]]s, without the use of cash. When a business makes a cash sale, it will keep the cash it receives until it itself pays it to someone else or deposits it into a bank account, keeping part of it in its \u201cfloat\u201d, being the cash needed in order to give a change to customers. A significant part of the cash in circulation is used by and held within the [[Black market|black economy]].\n\n==Foreign currency reserves==\nCentral banks of many countries hold currency of another country in their [[foreign exchange reserves]], which can include banknotes, deposits, bonds, treasury bills and other government securities. The cash component is counted by the issuing central bank as part of its currency in circulation.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of money}}\nThe American colonies or states governments were able to circulate [[Bill of credit|bills of credit]].

He served as a general in the [[United States Army]] from 1814 to 1861, taking part in the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the early stages of the [[American Civil War]], and various [[American Indian Wars|conflicts]] with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Scott was the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]'s presidential nominee in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]], but was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Franklin Pierce]]. He was known as '''Old Fuss and Feathers''' for his insistence on proper military etiquette, and as the '''Grand Old Man of the Army''' for his many years of service.\n\nScott was born near [[Petersburg, Virginia]], in 1786. After training as a lawyer and brief militia service, he joined the army in 1808 as a captain of the light artillery. In the War of 1812, Scott served on the [[Canada|Canadian]] front, taking part in the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] and the [[Battle of Fort George]], and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in early 1814. He served with distinction in the [[Battle of Chippawa]], but was badly wounded in the subsequent [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]]. After the conclusion of the war, Scott was assigned to command army forces in a district containing much of the Northeastern United States, and he and his family made their home near New York City. During the 1830s, Scott negotiated an end to the [[Black Hawk War]], took part in the [[Second Seminole War]] and the [[Creek War of 1836]], and presided over the [[Indian removal|removal]] of the [[Cherokee]]. Scott also helped to avert war with Britain, defusing tensions arising from the [[Patriot War]] and the [[Aroostook War]]. \n\nIn 1841, Scott became the [[Commanding General of the United States Army]], beating out his rival, [[Edmund P. Gaines]], for the position. After the outbreak of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846, Scott initially served as an administrator, but in 1847 he led a campaign against the [[Mexico|Mexican]] capital of [[Mexico City]]. After [[Siege of Veracruz|capturing]] the port city of [[Veracruz]], he defeated Mexican General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]'s armies at the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]], the [[Battle of Contreras]], and the [[Battle of Churubusco]] and [[Battle for Mexico City|captured Mexico City]]. He maintained order in the Mexican capital and indirectly helped envoy [[Nicholas Trist]] negotiate the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which brought an end to the war.\n\nScott was a candidate for the Whig presidential nomination in 1840, 1844, and 1848, and he finally won the Whig presidential nomination at the [[1852 Whig National Convention]]. The Whigs were badly divided over the [[Compromise of 1850]], and Pierce won a decisive victory over his former commander. Nonetheless, Scott remained popular among the public, and in 1855 he received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to the rank of [[lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]], becoming the first U.S. Army officer to hold that rank since [[George Washington]]. Despite being a Virginia native, Scott stayed loyal to the Union and served as an important adviser to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the opening stages of the Civil War. He developed a strategy known as the [[Anaconda Plan]], but retired in late 1861 after Lincoln increasingly relied on General [[George B. McClellan]] for military advice and leadership. Scott's military talent was highly regarded by contemporaries, and historians generally consider him to be one of the most accomplished generals in U.S. history.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Winfield Scott.svg|upright=1|thumb|Scott used this [[coat of arms]] for his [[bookplate]].{{sfn|''Hobbies magazine'' |page=139}} It has been incorporated into the heraldry of various units of the U.S. Army, including the [[1st Engineer Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[7th Engineer Battalion (United States)|7th]] Engineer Battalions.{{sfn|''U.S. Army Heraldic Crests''|pages=108\u2013109}}]]\n\nWinfield Scott was born on June 13, 1786, to Ann Mason and her husband, William Scott, a farmer, veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War]], and officer in the [[Dinwiddie County, Virginia|Dinwiddie County]] militia.{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=1\u20132}} At the time, the Scott family resided at Laurel Hill, a plantation near [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Southwick|1998|p=219}} Ann Mason Scott was the daughter of Daniel Mason and Elizabeth Winfield, and it was Ann's mother's maiden name that William and Ann Scott selected for their son.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=1}} Scott's paternal grandfather, James Scott, had migrated from [[Scotland]] after the defeat of [[Charles Edward Stuart]]'s forces in the [[Battle of Culloden]]. Scott's father died when Scott was six years old; his mother did not remarry, and she continued to raise Scott, his brother, and his two sisters until her death in 1803.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=1\u20132}} Although Scott's family held considerable wealth, most of the family fortune went to his older brother, James.{{sfn|Southwick|1998|p=220}}\n\nIn 1805, Scott began attending the [[College of William and Mary]], but he soon left in order to study law in the office of attorney David Robinson, where his contemporaries included [[Thomas Ruffin]].{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=4}} While apprenticing under Robinson, he attended the trial of [[Aaron Burr]], who had been accused of [[treason]] for his role in events now known as the [[Burr conspiracy]].{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=56}} During the trial, Scott developed a negative opinion of the [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Senior Officer of the United States Army]], General [[James Wilkinson]], as the result of Wilkinson's obvious efforts to minimize his complicity in Burr's actions by providing forged evidence and false, self-serving testimony.{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=8\u201310}} In 1807, Scott gained his initial military experience as a [[Corporal#United States|corporal]] of [[cavalry]] in the Virginia [[militia]], serving in the midst of the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard Affair]].{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=6}}  Scott led a detachment that captured eight [[United Kingdom|British]] sailors who had attempted to land in order to purchase provisions.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=6}} Virginia authorities did not approve of this action, fearing it might spark a wider conflict, and they soon ordered the release of the prisoners.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=6}} Later that year, Scott attempted to establish a legal practice in [[South Carolina]], but was unable to obtain a law license because he did not meet the state's one-year residency requirement.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7\u20139}}\n\n==Early career, 1807\u20131815==\n===First years in the army===\n{{see also|Origins of the War of 1812}}\n\nIn early 1808, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] asked Congress to authorize an expansion of the [[United States Army]] after the British announced an escalation of their naval blockade of [[France]], thereby threatening American shipping. Scott convinced a family friend, [[William Branch Giles]], to help him obtain a commission in the newly-expanded army.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=9\u201310}}  In May 1808, shortly before his twenty-second birthday, Scott was commissioned as a [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] in the [[light artillery]].{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} Tasked with recruiting a [[company (military unit)|company]], he raised his troops from the Petersburg and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] areas, and then traveled with his unit to [[New Orleans]] to join his [[regiment]].{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} Scott was deeply disturbed by what he viewed as the unprofessionalism of the army, which at the time consisted of just 2,700 soldiers. He later wrote that \"the old officers had, very generally, sunk into either sloth, ignorance, or habits of intemperate drinking.\"{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=13\u201314}} \n\nHe soon clashed with his commander, General [[James Wilkinson]], over Wilkinson's refusal to follow the orders of Secretary of War [[William Eustis]] to remove troops from an unhealthy bivouac site.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} Wilkinson owned the site, and while the poor location caused several illnesses and deaths among his soldiers, Wilkinson refused to relocate them because he personally profited.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} In addition, staying near New Orleans enabled Wilkinson to pursue his private business interests and continue the courtship of Celestine Trudeau, whom he later married.<ref name=\"Johnson1998\"/> Scott briefly resigned his commission over his dissatisfaction with Wilkinson, but before his resignation had been accepted, he withdrew it and returned to the army.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pages=17\u201318}} In January 1810, Scott was convicted in a court-martial, partly for making disrespectful comments about Wilkinson's integrity,{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pages=18\u201319}} and partly because of a $50 shortage in the $400 account he had been provided to conduct recruiting duty in Virginia after receiving his commission.{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=9\u201310}} With respect to the money, the court-martial members indicated that Scott had not been intentionally dishonest, but had failed to keep accurate records.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=10}} His commission was suspended for one year.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=18\u201319}} After the trial, Scott fought a duel with William Upshaw, an army medical officer and Wilkinson friend who Scott blamed for causing the court-martial; each fired at the other, but both emerged unharmed.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|page=19}}\n\nAfter the duel, Scott returned to Virginia, where he spent the year studying military tactics and strategy,{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=7}} and practicing law in partnership with [[Benjamin Watkins Leigh]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pages=20\u201321}} Meanwhile, Wilkinson was removed from command for insubordination, and was succeeded by General [[Wade Hampton I|Wade Hampton]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=16\u201317}} The rousing reception Scott received from his army peers as he began his suspension led him to believe that most officers approved of his anti-Wilkinson comments, at least tacitly; their high opinion of him, coupled with Leigh's counsel to remain in the army, convinced Scott to resume his military career once his suspension had been served.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=20\u201321}} He rejoined the army in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], where one of his first duties was to serve as judge advocate in the court-martial of Colonel [[Thomas Humphrey Cushing]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=22\u201323}}\n\n===War of 1812===\n[[File:Anglo American War 1812 Locations map-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|Map showing the northern theater of the [[War of 1812]]]]\n{{Further|Presidency of James Madison}}\n\nTensions between Britain and the United States continued to rise as Britain attacked American shipping, [[impressment|impressed]] American sailors, and encouraged [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] resistance to American settlement. In July 1812, Congress [[Declaration of war by the United States|declared war]] against Britain.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=23\u201325}} After the declaration of war, Scott was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and assigned as the second-in-command of the 2d Artillery, serving under [[George Izard]]. While Izard continued to recruit soldiers, Scott led two companies north to join General [[Stephen Van Rensselaer]]'s militia force, which was preparing for an invasion of [[Canada]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=27\u201328}} President [[James Madison]] made the invasion the central part of his administration's war strategy in 1812, as he sought to capture [[Montreal]] and thereby take control of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and cut off [[Upper Canada]] from [[Lower Canada]]. The invasion would begin with an attack on the town of [[Queenston, Ontario|Queenston]], which was just across the [[Niagara River]] from [[New York (state)|New York]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n[[File:Winfield Scott, ca. War of 1812.jpg|thumb|right|Scott during the War of 1812]]\n\nIn October 1812, Van Rensselaer's force attacked British forces in the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]]. Scott led an artillery bombardment that supported an American crossing of the Niagara River, and he took command of American forces at Queenston after Colonel [[Solomon Van Rensselaer]] was badly wounded.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=37\u201339}} Shortly after Scott took command, a British column under [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]] arrived. Sheaffe's numerically-superior forces compelled an American retreat, ultimately forcing Scott to surrender after reinforcements from the militia failed to materialize.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=39\u201341}} As a [[prisoner of war]], Scott was treated hospitably by the British, although two [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] leaders nearly killed him while he was in British custody.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=42\u201343}} As part of a prisoner exchange, Scott was released in late November; upon his return to the United States, he was promoted to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and made the commander of the 2d Artillery. He also became the chief of staff to General [[Henry Dearborn]], who was the senior general of the army and personally led operations against Canada in the area around Lake Ontario.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=46, 51\u201354}}\n\nDearborn assigned Scott to lead an [[Battle of Fort George|attack]] against [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]], which commanded a strategic position on the Niagara River. With help from naval commanders [[Isaac Chauncey]] and [[Oliver Hazard Perry]], Scott landed American forces behind the fort, forcing its surrender. Scott was widely praised for his conduct in the battle, although he was personally disappointed that the bulk of the British garrison escaped capture.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=55\u201359}} As part of another campaign to capture Montreal, Scott forced the British to withdrawal from Hoople Creek in November 1813.

Clay, [[Daniel Webster]], and General Zachary Taylor were also candidates for the nomination. As in 1840, Whigs were looking for a non-ideological war hero to be their candidate. Scott's main appeal was to anti-slavery \"conscience Whigs\", who were dismayed by the fact that two of the leading contenders, Clay and Taylor, were slaveholders. Ultimately, however, the delegates passed on Scott for a second time, nominating Taylor on the fourth ballot. Many anti-[[slavery in the United States|slavery]] Whigs then defected to support the nominee of the [[Free-Soil Party]], former President Martin Van Buren. Taylor went on to win the general election.<ref name=\"cDbYx\" />\n\nAfter the war, Scott returned to his administrative duties as the army's senior general.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=321\u2013322}} Congress became engaged in a divisive debate over the status of slavery in the territories, and Scott joined with Whig leaders Henry Clay and [[Daniel Webster]] in advocating for passage of what became known as the [[Compromise of 1850]]. Meanwhile, Taylor died of an illness in July 1850 and was succeeded by Vice President [[Millard Fillmore]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=322\u2013324}} The Compromise of 1850 and the enforcement of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] badly divided the country as a whole and the Whig Party in particular. Northerners strongly objected to the stringent provisions of the act, while Southerners complained bitterly about any perceived slackness in enforcement.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=208\u2013213}} Despite Scott's support for the Compromise of 1850, he became the chosen candidate of [[William Seward]], a leading Northern Whig who objected to the Compromise of 1850 partly because of the fugitive slave act.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=324\u2013325}}\n\n===Presidential election of 1852===\n[[File:Scott vs Pierce campaign.jpg|thumb|''The Game-cock & the Goose'', an 1852 Whig cartoon favoring Winfield Scott]]\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1852.svg|thumb|right|Democrat [[Franklin Pierce]] defeated Whig Winfield Scott in the 1852 election]]\n\nBy early 1852, the three leading candidates for the Whig presidential nomination were Scott, who was backed by anti-Compromise Northern Whigs, President Fillmore, the first choice of most Southern Whigs, and Secretary of State Webster, whose support was concentrated in New England.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=325\u2013327}} The [[1852 Whig National Convention]] convened on June 16, and Southern delegates won approval of a [[party platform]] endorsing the Compromise of 1850 as a final settlement of the slavery question.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=244\u2013247}} On the convention's first presidential ballot, Fillmore received 133 of the necessary 147 votes, while Scott won 131 and Webster won 29. After the 46th ballot still failed to produce a presidential nominee, the delegates voted to adjourn until the following Monday. Over the weekend, Fillmore and Webster supporters conducted unsuccessful negotiations to unite behind one candidate.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=244\u2013247}} On the 48th ballot, Webster delegates began to defect to Scott, and the general gained the nomination on the 53rd ballot.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=244\u2013247}} Fillmore accepted his defeat with equanimity and endorsed Scott, but many Northern Whigs were dismayed when Scott publicly endorsed the party's pro-Compromise platform.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=327\u2013328}} Despite the party's effort to appeal to southerners by nominating [[William Alexander Graham]] of [[North Carolina]] for vice president, many Southern Whigs, including [[Alexander H. Stephens]] and [[Robert Toombs]], refused to support Scott.{{sfn|McPherson|p=118}}\n\nThe [[1852 Democratic National Convention]] nominated [[dark horse]] candidate [[Franklin Pierce]], a Northerner sympathetic to the Southern view on slavery.{{sfn|Smith|1988|pp=237\u2013239, 244}} Pierce had resigned from the U.S. Senate in 1842, and had briefly held only the minor office of [[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire#U.S. Attorney for New Hampshire|District of New Hampshire]] since then, but emerged as a compromise candidate partly because of his service under Scott in the Mexican\u2013American War.<ref name=\"l9Tkf\" /> The Democrats attacked Scott for various incidents from his long public career, including his court-martial in 1809 and the hanging of members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion during the Mexican\u2013American War.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=328\u2013329}} Scott proved to be a poor candidate who lacked popular appeal, and he suffered the worst defeat in Whig history.{{sfn|Holt|1999|pp=754\u2013755}} In the South, distrust and apathy towards Scott led many Southern Whigs to vote for Pierce or to sit out the election, and in the North, many anti-slavery Whigs voted for [[John P.

He maintained cordial relations with President Pierce but frequently clashed with Pierce's Secretary of War, [[Jefferson Davis]], over issues like travel expenses.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=331\u2013332}} Despite his defeat in the 1852 presidential election, Scott remained broadly popular, and on Pierce's recommendation, in 1855 Congress passed a resolution promoting Scott to brevet lieutenant general.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=331\u2013333}}<ref name=\"12Aj5\" /> Scott was the [[List of lieutenant generals in the United States Army before 1960|first]] U.S. Army officer since [[George Washington]] to hold the rank of lieutenant general.<ref name=\"ltgen\" />{{efn|Prior to the [[American Civil War]], Washington and Scott were the only U.S. Army officers to hold the rank of lieutenant general, although Washington held the rank as a permanent, rather than brevet, appointment.

Pierce was denied re-nomination in favor of James Buchanan, while the Whig Party collapsed. In the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]], Buchanan defeated [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] of the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and former President Fillmore, the candidate of the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[Know Nothing|American Party]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=334\u2013337}} Sectional tensions continued to escalate after the Supreme Court handed down its decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]''. Buchanan proved incapable of healing sectional divides, and some leading Southerners became increasingly vocal in their desire to secede from the union.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=337\u2013338}} In 1859, Buchanan assigned Scott to lead a mission to settle a dispute with Britain over the ownership of the [[San Juan Islands]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Scott reached an agreement with British official [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] to reduce military forces on the islands, thereby resolving the so-called \"[[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]]\".{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=338\u2013341}} \n\nIn the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], the Republicans nominated [[Abraham Lincoln]], while the Democrats split along sectional lines, with Northern Democrats supporting Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] and Southern Democrats supporting Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]]. Lincoln won the election, taking just 44 percent of the popular vote but winning a majority of the electoral vote due to his support in the North.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=345\u2013346}} Fearing the possibility of imminent secession, Scott advised Buchanan and Secretary of War [[John B. Floyd]] to reinforce federal forts in the South. He was initially ignored, but Scott gained new influence within the administration after Floyd was replaced by [[Joseph Holt]] in mid-December. With assistance from Holt and newly-appointed Secretary of State [[Jeremiah S. Black]], Scott convinced Buchanan to reinforce or resupply Washington, D.C., [[Fort Sumter]] (near Charleston, South Carolina), and [[Fort Pickens]] (near [[Pensacola, Florida]]). Meanwhile, several Southern states seceded, formed the [[Confederate States of America]], and chose Jefferson Davis as president.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=346\u2013350}} \n\nBecause Scott was from Virginia, Lincoln sent an envoy, Thomas S. Mather, to ask whether Scott would remain loyal to the United States and keep order during [[first inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's inauguration]]. Scott responded to Mather, \"I shall consider myself responsible for [Lincoln's] safety. If necessary, I shall plant cannon at both ends of [[Pennsylvania Avenue]], and if any of the Maryland or Virginia gentlemen who have become so threatening and troublesome show their heads or even venture to raise a finger, I shall blow them to hell.\"{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=349\u2013352}} Scott helped ensure that Lincoln arrived in Washington safely, and ensured the security of Lincoln's inauguration, which ultimately was conducted without a major incident.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=352\u2013355}}\n\n===Lincoln administration===\n{{Further|Presidency of Abraham Lincoln}}\n[[File:Currier & Ives - The champions of the Union 1861.jpg|thumb|left|1861 Currier & Ives engraving of Winfield Scott and other Union generals, indicative of the Northern sentiment towards him and others in 1861]]\n\nBy the time Lincoln assumed office, seven states had declared their secession and had seized federal property within their bounds, but the United States retained control of the military installations at Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens.{{sfn|McPherson|2008|p=13}} Scott advised evacuating the forts on the grounds that an attempted re-supply would inflame tensions with the South, and that Confederate shore batteries made re-supply impossible.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=358\u2013361}} Lincoln rejected the advice and chose to re-supply the forts; although Scott accepted the orders, his resistance to the re-supply mission, along with poor health, undermined his status within the administration. Nonetheless, he remained a key military adviser and administrator.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=360\u2013363, 381}} On April 12, Confederate forces began an [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack]] on Fort Sumter, forcing its surrender the following day.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=366\u2013367}} On April 15, Lincoln declared that a state of rebellion existed and [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|called up tens of thousands of militiamen]].

By cutting off the eastern states of the Confederacy, Scott hoped to force the surrender of Confederate forces with a minimal loss of life on both sides. Scott's plan was leaked to the public, and was derided by most Northern newspapers, which tended to favor an immediate assault on the Confederacy.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=385\u2013387}} As Scott was too old for battlefield command, Lincoln selected General [[Irvin McDowell]], an officer whom Scott saw as unimaginative and inexperienced, to lead the main Union army in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|eastern theater]] of the war.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=387\u2013388}} Though Scott counseled that the army needed more time to train, Lincoln ordered an offensive against the Confederate capital of Richmond. Irvin McDowell led a force of 30,000 men south, where he met Confederate Army at [[First Battle of Bull Run]]. The Confederate army dealt the Union a major defeat, ending any hope of a quick end to the war.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=429\u2013435}}\n\nMcDowell took the brunt of public vituperation for the defeat at Bull Run, but Scott, who had helped plan the battle, also received criticism.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=388\u2013392}} Lincoln replaced McDowell with McClellan, and the president began meeting with McClellan without Scott in attendance.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=393\u2013394}} Frustrated with his diminished standing, Scott submitted his resignation in October 1861. Though Scott favored General [[Henry Halleck]] as his successor, Lincoln instead made McClellan the army's senior officer.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=393\u2013398}}\n\n==Retirement and death==\n[[File:Winfield Scott Seated 1861.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Scott in 1861]]\n\nAfter retiring, Scott traveled to Europe with his daughter, Cornelia, and her husband, H.

After McClellan's defeat in the [[Seven Days Battles]], Lincoln accepted Scott's advice and appointed General Halleck as the army's senior general. In 1864, Scott sent a copy of his newly-published memoirs to Ulysses S. Grant, who had succeeded Halleck as the lead Union general. The copy that Scott sent was inscribed, \"from the oldest to the greatest general.\"{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=402\u2013404}} Following a strategy similar to Scott's Anaconda Plan, Grant led the Union to victory, and the Confederate army [[Conclusion of the American Civil War|surrendered]] in April 1865.<ref name=\"malanga\" />\n\nScott died at the West Point on May 29, 1866.{{sfn|Southwick|1998|p=220}} President [[Andrew Johnson]] ordered the flags flown at half-staff to honor Scott, and Scott's funeral was attended by many of the leading Union generals, including Grant, George G.

He served as a general in the [[United States Army]] from 1814 to 1861, taking part in the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the early stages of the [[American Civil War]], and various [[American Indian Wars|conflicts]] with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Scott was the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]'s presidential nominee in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]], but was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Franklin Pierce]]. He was known as '''Old Fuss and Feathers''' for his insistence on proper military etiquette, and as the '''Grand Old Man of the Army''' for his many years of service.\n\nScott was born near [[Petersburg, Virginia]], in 1786. After training as a lawyer and brief militia service, he joined the army in 1808 as a captain of the light artillery. In the War of 1812, Scott served on the [[Canada|Canadian]] front, taking part in the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] and the [[Battle of Fort George]], and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in early 1814. He served with distinction in the [[Battle of Chippawa]], but was badly wounded in the subsequent [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]]. After the conclusion of the war, Scott was assigned to command army forces in a district containing much of the Northeastern United States, and he and his family made their home near New York City. During the 1830s, Scott negotiated an end to the [[Black Hawk War]], took part in the [[Second Seminole War]] and the [[Creek War of 1836]], and presided over the [[Indian removal|removal]] of the [[Cherokee]]. Scott also helped to avert war with Britain, defusing tensions arising from the [[Patriot War]] and the [[Aroostook War]]. \n\nIn 1841, Scott became the [[Commanding General of the United States Army]], beating out his rival, [[Edmund P. Gaines]], for the position. After the outbreak of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846, Scott initially served as an administrator, but in 1847 he led a campaign against the [[Mexico|Mexican]] capital of [[Mexico City]]. After [[Siege of Veracruz|capturing]] the port city of [[Veracruz]], he defeated Mexican General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]'s armies at the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]], the [[Battle of Contreras]], and the [[Battle of Churubusco]] and [[Battle for Mexico City|captured Mexico City]]. He maintained order in the Mexican capital and indirectly helped envoy [[Nicholas Trist]] negotiate the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which brought an end to the war.\n\nScott was a candidate for the Whig presidential nomination in 1840, 1844, and 1848, and he finally won the Whig presidential nomination at the [[1852 Whig National Convention]]. The Whigs were badly divided over the [[Compromise of 1850]], and Pierce won a decisive victory over his former commander. Nonetheless, Scott remained popular among the public, and in 1855 he received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to the rank of [[lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]], becoming the first U.S. Army officer to hold that rank since [[George Washington]]. Despite being a Virginia native, Scott stayed loyal to the Union and served as an important adviser to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the opening stages of the Civil War. He developed a strategy known as the [[Anaconda Plan]], but retired in late 1861 after Lincoln increasingly relied on General [[George B. McClellan]] for military advice and leadership. Scott's military talent was highly regarded by contemporaries, and historians generally consider him to be one of the most accomplished generals in U.S. history.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Winfield Scott.svg|upright=1|thumb|Scott used this [[coat of arms]] for his [[bookplate]].{{sfn|''Hobbies magazine'' |page=139}} It has been incorporated into the heraldry of various units of the U.S. Army, including the [[1st Engineer Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[7th Engineer Battalion (United States)|7th]] Engineer Battalions.{{sfn|''U.S. Army Heraldic Crests''|pages=108\u2013109}}]]\n\nWinfield Scott was born on June 13, 1786, to Ann Mason and her husband, William Scott, a farmer, veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War]], and officer in the [[Dinwiddie County, Virginia|Dinwiddie County]] militia.{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=1\u20132}} At the time, the Scott family resided at Laurel Hill, a plantation near [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Southwick|1998|p=219}} Ann Mason Scott was the daughter of Daniel Mason and Elizabeth Winfield, and it was Ann's mother's maiden name that William and Ann Scott selected for their son.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=1}} Scott's paternal grandfather, James Scott, had migrated from [[Scotland]] after the defeat of [[Charles Edward Stuart]]'s forces in the [[Battle of Culloden]].

Clay, [[Daniel Webster]], and General Zachary Taylor were also candidates for the nomination. As in 1840, Whigs were looking for a non-ideological war hero to be their candidate. Scott's main appeal was to anti-slavery \"conscience Whigs\", who were dismayed by the fact that two of the leading contenders, Clay and Taylor, were slaveholders. Ultimately, however, the delegates passed on Scott for a second time, nominating Taylor on the fourth ballot.

Since his debut, he has appeared in almost every ''Mario'' franchise game, usually serving as the main antagonist. Bowser is voiced by Kenny James. In addition to his usual animated and video game appearances, he also appears in the [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|1993 live-action film]], where he is portrayed by [[Dennis Hopper]].\n\n==Concept and creation==\nBowser was created by Nintendo designer and producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. Miyamoto had first envisioned Bowser as an [[ox]], basing him on the Ox King from the [[Toei Animation]] film ''[[Alakazam the Great]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ds.kombo.com/article.php?artid=7373|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917090724/http://ds.kombo.com/article.php?artid=7373|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 17, 2010|author=David Oxford|title=Iwata Asks:The Birth of Bowser|publisher=Ds.Kombo|accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref> However, Nintendo designer [[Takashi Tezuka]] pointed out that the character looked a lot more like a turtle than an ox. Miyamoto and Tezuka then began to work together to define Bowser's appearance. Since the character was the leader of the turtle-like Koopa Troopas the two began to base his new appearance on them, creating a new illustration. In his final design, Miyamoto commented that he could make Bowser \"look cool now\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks Volume 8- Flipnote Studios-An Animation Class 4.My First Project: Draw a Rug |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/systems/volume_8_14207.html#top |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525101151/http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/systems/volume_8_14207.html#top |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 25, 2012 }}2009-08-11</ref>\n\nMiyamoto named him {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5927|\u5927]] [[wikt:\u9b54|\u9b54]] [[wikt:\u738b|\u738b]] \u30af\u30c3\u30d1}} ''Daima\u014d Kuppa''.

(film)|''Super Mario Bros.'' film]], Bowser is portrayed by [[Dennis Hopper]] and is called President Koopa. He is also briefly referred to as King Koopa. This incarnation is almost entirely human in appearance, with blonde hair he gels in the shape of a crown, and he frequently wears a black business suit and tie. However, after brief exposure to his own evolution-reversing device by the Mario Bros., he starts occasionally possessing some reptilian traits. The climax of the film sees Koopa devolve into an enormous green [[Tyrannosaurus|''Tyrannosaurus rex'']] to battle the Mario Bros., but he is further devolved into primordial ooze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smbmovie.com/SMBArchive/specials/interviews/2_JeffGoodwin_3-30-09.html|title=Super Mario Bros. The Movie Archive|publisher=Smbmovie.com|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nBowser is portrayed as the \"King of the [[Koopa Troopa|Koopas]]\", [[anthropomorphic]] [[turtle]]s that inhabit the world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. Bowser differs greatly from the rest of the Koopa clan, which consists mainly of bipedal tortoises. He is characterized by a large, spiked [[turtle shell]], horns, a draconic muzzle, razor-sharp fangs, taloned fingers, three clawed toes on each foot, red eyes and a shock of red hair.\n\nHe is physically endowed with immense strength, is nearly indestructible, and can [[Fire breathing|breathe fire]]. He can also jump surprisingly high for his large size, although his [[speed]] and [[agility]] are most of the time lacking. He is also accomplished in black magic, thanks to which he can teleport himself or summon objects, fly, generate a huge amount of electricity, use telekinesis or metamorphose.\n\nBowser's physical size tends to vary from game to game. In most games, he towers over the majority of characters, but there are exceptions. In ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he stands only slightly taller than Mario. He is shown changing his size at will or through others' sorcery in games including ''[[Yoshi's Island]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''.\n\nBowser aspires to take over the Mushroom Kingdom and merge it with his own realm. He is infatuated with [[Princess Peach]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars Strategy Guide}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game|title=Paper Mario|developer=Intelligent Systems}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game|title=Super Paper Mario|developer=Intelligent Systems}}</ref> and routinely kidnaps her as part of his plans for domination.<ref name=Screwattack /> Sometimes, he kidnaps Peach simply to lure [[Mario]] into a trap, but occasionally he hopes to marry her.\n\nThe character's role in the franchise varies. He is typically the main antagonist in the main series, but in [[List of Mario role-playing games|the RPG series]], he sometimes works with the heroes to defeat a greater evil.<ref>''[[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'', and ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]''.</ref> The RPGs also portray Bowser in a more humorous light as a blustering, buffoonish [[Bullying|bully]] with a hidden softer side. He also cares for his minions.\n\nBowser has a son, [[Bowser Jr.]], who helps his father kidnap Princess Peach. Bowser Jr.'s mother is unknown, as Bowser isn't officially confirmed as having a previous marriage yet. Originally in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Bowser was stated to be the father of the [[Koopalings]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/ja/pdf/CLV-P-HAACJ.pdf |title=Original Japanese manual of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. |publisher= Nintendo Co., Ltd. |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref> with subsequent official sources adding that he was their biological father,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/NES/Super-Mario-Bros-3-279558.html |title=''Super Mario Bros. 3'' page on Nintendo UK's site. |publisher= Nintendo UK |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>\"''Bowser, King of the Koopas, and his evil offspring have invaded yet another kingdom.

Then, in the 2002 release of ''Super Mario Sunshine'', [[radio personality]] and voice actor Scott Burns gave Bowser his first spoken dialogue and continued portraying him for several more years. With the late 2005 release of ''[[Super Mario Strikers]]'', Kenneth W. James became the new voice actor for Bowser. Although, for a few years, old recordings of Burns were reused for games after James took the role, such as ''[[Mario Party DS]]''. Between Burns and James, Bowser was briefly voiced by Eric Newsome in ''[[Super Paper Mario]]''. Computerized roars are still used for Bowser occasionally in such games as the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In video games===\n\n====''Super Mario'' series====\nBowser's first appearance was in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as the main antagonist who kidnaps [[Princess Peach]] and as the [[Boss (video gaming)|final boss]] with several false versions of him appearing as lesser bosses. In addition to breathing fire, he also throws hammers in later levels, similar to the [[Hammer Bros.]] He reappears in ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'', in which he uses the same battle tactics as in the previous game. Although he was absent in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (where he was replaced by [[Wart (character)|Wart]] as the final boss), he appears in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', and along with the [[Koopalings]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screwattack.com/news/koopalings-are-not-related-bowser |title=The koopalings are NOT related to Bowser!!! |accessdate=December 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916012336/http://www.screwattack.com/news/koopalings-are-not-related-bowser |archivedate=September 16, 2012}}</ref> he transforms the kings of seven worlds into various different creatures and eventually capturing Princess Peach yet again. Bowser and his seven koopalings reappear in ''[[Super Mario World]]'', where they conquer Dinosaur Land and kidnap Peach while she and Mario are on vacation on Yoshi's Island. He makes his first 3D appearance in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', where he takes over Peach's castle and steals 120 Power Stars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/833/833615p4.html|title=IGN Presents: The History of Super Mario Bros. \u2013 Retro Feature at IGN|publisher=Retro.ign.com|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref> (150 in ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]''), scattering them through various worlds linked using the castle. He returns in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', in which his youngest, but favorite son, [[Bowser Jr.]], who is disguised as an evil version of Mario, kidnaps Peach. Bowser himself eventually appears in the final boss battle of the game. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'', Bowser is the boss of the first world, which features a battle similar to that of ''Super Mario Bros.'' After being defeated, he falls into lava and is reduced to a skeleton called Dry Bowser. He is eventually restored by Bowser Jr. and acts as the final world's boss along with his son. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Bowser steals the Power Stars from [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina's]] Comet Observatory and kidnaps Peach, taking her to the center of the universe to recreate it, with the intention of taking over the universe. He also appears in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' as the final boss and primary antagonist of the game. After being defeated at the end, he grows to a much greater size, chasing Mario through the castle by breathing fireballs before Mario defeats him again. Bowser appears in the sequel ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', once again as the main antagonist. Here, however, Bowser has grown to giant size, requiring the player to dodge more powerful attacks such as [[Meteoroid#Meteor|meteors]] and bolts of lightning. Bowser also appears in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' as the main antagonist once again where he steals Peach and uses the [[Super Mario Bros. 3|Super Leaf]] to create tailed minions. Dry Bowser also returns in this game as well. Bowser also appeared in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' along with his Koopalings in order to capture Peach once more. Dry Bowser also makes an appearance in this game. Bowser returns as the main antagonist of ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U|New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[New Super Luigi U|Luigi U]]'' along with the Koopalings and his son, but this time, they invade Castle Toadstool. Bowser returns once again in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' as the main antagonist who is fought thrice, including as the final boss in a form known as Meowser, and this time, he will take over the Sprixie Kingdom by kidnapping the seven Sprixies so that he may steal the kingdom's treasures. He appears once more in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' as the main antagonist, kidnapping Peach so he can marry her. He goes about various kingdoms, stealing items for his use at the wedding. He also enlisted the aid of a band of anthropomorphic rabbits named \u201cThe Broodals\u201d as his wedding planners and also to stop Mario from thwarting Bowser's wedding plans. He serves as a boss midway through the game and also as the final boss. Once all Power Moons are obtained, an alternate final battle with Bowser can be unlocked.\n\nBowser appears as a child in various games. Known as '''Baby Bowser''' (not to be confused with [[Bowser Jr.]]), he antagonizes the Baby Mario brothers and various members of the [[Yoshi]] species. He first appears in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'' where [[List of Mario franchise characters#Kamek|Kamek]] predicts the brothers will become problems in the future, so he attempts to kidnap them. He appears yet again in the sequel ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', stealing the \"Super Happy Tree\" from a group of Yoshis. He appeared yet again in ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]'' as a playable character to recover his castle. Baby Bowser and his older self also appeared in ''[[Yoshi's New Island]]'' as the final boss. Baby Bowser makes an appearance in ''[[Yoshi's Woolly World]]'' as the [[main antagonist]]. Baby Bowser also appears alongside adult Bowser in early installments of the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, typically as a flunky for adult Bowser but also stealing coins from players on the game boards.\n\nIn ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', Bowser can now be placed in any non-castle level. Although he cannot throw hammers, a winged [[Bowser Jr.]] can be stacked on top of him for that purpose. A Bowser costume can also be unlocked for use in the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' style.\n\n====Other games====\n* Bowser makes various appearances in the ''Mario'' [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]].\n** In ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he uses Mario and the Koopa Troop to become an ally only to reclaim his castle which is stolen by the main antagonist Smithy.\n** [[List of Mario role-playing games#Paper Mario series|The ''Paper Mario'' series]]\n*** In [[Paper Mario|the first ''Paper Mario'' game]], he is the primary antagonist, stealing an item called the Star Rod and using it to empower himself.\n*** He is a lesser antagonist in ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door|The Thousand-Year Door]]'' and a minor playable character, and is a major playable character in the sequel ''[[Super Paper Mario]]''.\n*** He also appeared in ''[[Paper Mario: Sticker Star|Sticker Star]]'' as the main antagonist where he invades the [[Sticker]] Fest ceremony and serves as the final boss with the sixth and final Royal Sticker. Unlike the other games, this is the first ''Paper Mario'' game he doesn't talk.\n*** He appears in ''[[Paper Mario: Color Splash|Color Splash]]'' as the main antagonist. However, unusually, he is unintentionally evil in this game, having been corrupted by poisonous black paint he accidentally created, turning him into Black Bowser. Under its influence, Black Bowser plans to cover Prism Island, as well the Mushroom Kingdom in black paint.\n** [[List of Mario role-playing games#Mario & Luigi series|The ''Mario & Luigi'' series]]\n*** He plays minor antagonistic and supporting roles in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga|Superstar Saga]]'', where he aids Mario and Luigi in battling the witch Cackletta. At one point in the story, he loses his memory after a big clunk on the head and becomes '''Rookie''', the assistant of master thief Popple. After regaining it, he gets possessed by Cackletta's spirit, becoming '''Bowletta'''.\n**** In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions|Bowser's Minions]]'' he reprises his role from the original ''Superstar Saga'', only that this time his minions are fighting back against [[Fawful]]'s forces to free their leader.\n*** Its prequel/sequel, ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time|Partners in Time]]'', features both Bowser and Baby Bowser as minor antagonists (the major antagonists are an alien race called the Shroobs). Baby Bowser races against the Bros. to rebuild an artifact called the Cobalt Star, while Bowser, after failing to kidnap an impostor Peach, is enhanced by the elder Princess Shroob and becomes the final boss called '''Shrowser'''. Both Bowser and Baby Bowser also team up at one point to fight the Bros.\n*** In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story|Bowser's Inside Story]]'' and its 3DS remake ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story#Remake|Bowser Jr.'s Journey]]'', Bowser is the main protagonist and a playable character, with Mario and Luigi supporting him from inside his body without his knowledge. Although he is one of the game's 3 protagonists, he is still fought twice in the game as a boss by the Mario Bros.\n*** In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team|Dream Team]]'', he appeared as the main antagonist and major boss, being fought three times, including as the final boss where he becomes Dreamy Bowser. He forms an alliance with the initial antagonist Antasma, but later betrays Antasma (which he intended to do for a while).\n*** ''[[Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam|Paper Jam]]'', a crossover 3DS game, features both Bowser and his paper counterpart (Paper Bowser), similar to '''''Partners in Time''''' where Bowser and Baby Bowser meet each other, who team up.\n* In ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'', he uses the power of the Vibe Scepter to capture Mario and Luigi (prompting Princess Peach herself to come to their rescue).\n* He serves as the final boss in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' in a battle on the roof of the titular mansion itself. Throughout the battle, it becomes apparent that this incarnation is [[King Boo]] inside a Bowser costume, which falls inert to the floor if Luigi is victorious.\n* Bowser also appears as a playable character in the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series and various [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports titles]], such as ''[[Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis|Tennis]]'' and all five ''[[List of Mario sports games#Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games series|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' installments. Dry Bowser also appears in some of the sports games occasionally as a playable character, being an independent character as opposed to being a form of Bowser.\n* He also appears frequently in the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series as a [[non-playable character]], with a space that, if players land on it, causes him to appear and either steal Stars or coins or make the players play his [[minigames]]. He finally gets to be playable in ''[[Mario Party 10]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Party]]''.\n* Bowser is a selectable character within ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|3DS/Wii U]]'', and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]''. In these games is a form called '''Giga Bowser''', a darker and more monstrous form with added power elements to his attacks. This form is an unplayable boss character in ''Melee'', and is fought in Adventure Mode and the final Event Match (alongside [[Mewtwo]] and [[Ganondorf]]), while in ''Brawl'', ''3DS'' and ''Wii U''', it serves as a temporary playable transformation with the Final Smash. This monstrous form appears again as a boss in the Classic Mode of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]''. In The Subspace Emissary from ''Brawl'', Bowser is unplayable for most of the story and only becomes playable after [[King Dedede]] defeats him in a duel.\n* In the Wii U version of ''[[Bayonetta|Bayonetta 1]]'' and ''[[Bayonetta 2|2]]'', Bowser makes a cameo in which Bayonetta can summon his fists and feet when wearing the game's unlockable Princesses Peach and Daisy costumes.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n* Bowser appears as one of the [[List of Skylanders characters#SuperChargers|Skylanders]] in ''[[Skylanders: SuperChargers]]'' as a fire element SuperCharger along with Spitfire and the SuperCharger version of Eruptor. His signature vehicle is the Clown Cruiser. He is only available on the Wii, the Wii U, and the Nintendo 3DS along with [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]].\n* Bowser also appears in the SNES version of [[SimCity (1989 video game)|''SimCity'']]; he is the one attacking the player's city during the monster attack disaster instead of the monster resembling Godzilla in the original PC release.\n* In the 1996 game ''[[Tetris Attack]]'', he is the final boss fought on Hard and the hidden Super Hard difficulties in both the SNES and GB versions.\n\n===In other media===\n[[File:Bowserwreckitralph.png|thumb|The \"Bad-Anon\" villain meeting from ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' features Bowser and other various well-known video game characters, including [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|Clyde]], [[Doctor Eggman]], [[M.

The character is typically referred to as \"King Koopa\" rather than Bowser. His appearance in the cartoons was also different than his video game appearances. He had green skin and lacked his red hair and ability to breathe fire, although he did wield a magic wand similar to those seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.\n** Bowser uses various [[alter ego]]s in ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'' to match some of the episodes' titles.\n** In ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Bowser was assisted by his Koopa Kids, who received different names in the show.\n** In ''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'', Bowser and the Koopa Kids returned to fight Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, and Princess Peach in [[Super Mario (series)#Settings|Dinosaur Land]].\n* In 1989, Bowser, again referred to as \"King Koopa\", hosted a live action show entitled ''[[King Koopa's Kool Kartoons]]''. On this half-hour program, Bowser gives away prizes to the children.\n* Bowser appears as the antagonist in the ''Mario'' comics published as part of the [[Nintendo Comics System]].\n* In the 1993 [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|''Super Mario Bros.'']] movie, Bowser was played by [[Dennis Hopper]]. Here, he is President Koopa but is called \"King Koopa,\" who usurped the throne of the parallel-universe city of Dinohattan. Rather than a turtle, Koopa is a humanoid evolved from dinosaurs. Koopa is defeated when Mario and Luigi devolve him first into a [[Tyrannosaurus]] and then into primordial slime. The film version of Bowser/Koopa was met with significant criticism, and was mentioned by Hopper as the worst role he has ever played.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/dennis-hopper-speaks-candidly-about-his-role-as-king-koopa-110566.phtml|title=Dennis Hopper speaks candidly about his role as King Koopa|publisher=Destructoid|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>\n* Bowser was played by [[Christopher Hewett]] in the 1989 ''[[Ice Capades]]''.\n* Bowser also appears in the [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] game ''[[Hotel Mario]]'' as a final boss.\n* Bowser appears in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' as one of the video game villains that attend the villain support group Bad-Anon. When Wreck-It Ralph mentions his interest in not being a villain anymore, Bowser reacts to this by [[Fire breathing|breathing fire]] similar to a spit take since he was drinking something at the time.

(film)|''Super Mario Bros.'' film]], Bowser is portrayed by [[Dennis Hopper]] and is called President Koopa. He is also briefly referred to as King Koopa. This incarnation is almost entirely human in appearance, with blonde hair he gels in the shape of a crown, and he frequently wears a black business suit and tie. However, after brief exposure to his own evolution-reversing device by the Mario Bros., he starts occasionally possessing some reptilian traits. The climax of the film sees Koopa devolve into an enormous green [[Tyrannosaurus|''Tyrannosaurus rex'']] to battle the Mario Bros., but he is further devolved into primordial ooze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smbmovie.com/SMBArchive/specials/interviews/2_JeffGoodwin_3-30-09.html|title=Super Mario Bros. The Movie Archive|publisher=Smbmovie.com|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nBowser is portrayed as the \"King of the [[Koopa Troopa|Koopas]]\", [[anthropomorphic]] [[turtle]]s that inhabit the world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. Bowser differs greatly from the rest of the Koopa clan, which consists mainly of bipedal tortoises. He is characterized by a large, spiked [[turtle shell]], horns, a draconic muzzle, razor-sharp fangs, taloned fingers, three clawed toes on each foot, red eyes and a shock of red hair.\n\nHe is physically endowed with immense strength, is nearly indestructible, and can [[Fire breathing|breathe fire]]. He can also jump surprisingly high for his large size, although his [[speed]] and [[agility]] are most of the time lacking. He is also accomplished in black magic, thanks to which he can teleport himself or summon objects, fly, generate a huge amount of electricity, use telekinesis or metamorphose.\n\nBowser's physical size tends to vary from game to game. In most games, he towers over the majority of characters, but there are exceptions. In ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he stands only slightly taller than Mario. He is shown changing his size at will or through others' sorcery in games including ''[[Yoshi's Island]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''.\n\nBowser aspires to take over the Mushroom Kingdom and merge it with his own realm. He is infatuated with [[Princess Peach]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars Strategy Guide}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game|title=Paper Mario|developer=Intelligent Systems}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game|title=Super Paper Mario|developer=Intelligent Systems}}</ref> and routinely kidnaps her as part of his plans for domination.<ref name=Screwattack /> Sometimes, he kidnaps Peach simply to lure [[Mario]] into a trap, but occasionally he hopes to marry her.\n\nThe character's role in the franchise varies. He is typically the main antagonist in the main series, but in [[List of Mario role-playing games|the RPG series]], he sometimes works with the heroes to defeat a greater evil.<ref>''[[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'', and ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]''.</ref> The RPGs also portray Bowser in a more humorous light as a blustering, buffoonish [[Bullying|bully]] with a hidden softer side. He also cares for his minions.\n\nBowser has a son, [[Bowser Jr.]], who helps his father kidnap Princess Peach. Bowser Jr.'s mother is unknown, as Bowser isn't officially confirmed as having a previous marriage yet. Originally in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Bowser was stated to be the father of the [[Koopalings]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/ja/pdf/CLV-P-HAACJ.pdf |title=Original Japanese manual of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. |publisher= Nintendo Co., Ltd. |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref> with subsequent official sources adding that he was their biological father,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/NES/Super-Mario-Bros-3-279558.html |title=''Super Mario Bros. 3'' page on Nintendo UK's site. |publisher= Nintendo UK |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>\"''Bowser, King of the Koopas, and his evil offspring have invaded yet another kingdom.

Bowser's only child is Bowser Jr., and we do not know who the mother is.''\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/09/24/miyamoto-tezuka-interview.aspx |title=Mario's Creators Answer Burning Questions About The Series |publisher=Game Informer |accessdate=December 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130123161706/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/09/24/miyamoto-tezuka-interview.aspx |archive-date=January 23, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Voice and portrayal==\nUp until the release of ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', Bowser's voice consisted of mostly computer generated roars, snarls, and laughs. Then, in the 2002 release of ''Super Mario Sunshine'', [[radio personality]] and voice actor Scott Burns gave Bowser his first spoken dialogue and continued portraying him for several more years. With the late 2005 release of ''[[Super Mario Strikers]]'', Kenneth W. James became the new voice actor for Bowser. Although, for a few years, old recordings of Burns were reused for games after James took the role, such as ''[[Mario Party DS]]''. Between Burns and James, Bowser was briefly voiced by Eric Newsome in ''[[Super Paper Mario]]''. Computerized roars are still used for Bowser occasionally in such games as the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In video games===\n\n====''Super Mario'' series====\nBowser's first appearance was in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as the main antagonist who kidnaps [[Princess Peach]] and as the [[Boss (video gaming)|final boss]] with several false versions of him appearing as lesser bosses. In addition to breathing fire, he also throws hammers in later levels, similar to the [[Hammer Bros.]] He reappears in ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'', in which he uses the same battle tactics as in the previous game. Although he was absent in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (where he was replaced by [[Wart (character)|Wart]] as the final boss), he appears in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', and along with the [[Koopalings]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screwattack.com/news/koopalings-are-not-related-bowser |title=The koopalings are NOT related to Bowser!!! |accessdate=December 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916012336/http://www.screwattack.com/news/koopalings-are-not-related-bowser |archivedate=September 16, 2012}}</ref> he transforms the kings of seven worlds into various different creatures and eventually capturing Princess Peach yet again. Bowser and his seven koopalings reappear in ''[[Super Mario World]]'', where they conquer Dinosaur Land and kidnap Peach while she and Mario are on vacation on Yoshi's Island. He makes his first 3D appearance in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', where he takes over Peach's castle and steals 120 Power Stars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/833/833615p4.html|title=IGN Presents: The History of Super Mario Bros. \u2013 Retro Feature at IGN|publisher=Retro.ign.com|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref> (150 in ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]''), scattering them through various worlds linked using the castle. He returns in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', in which his youngest, but favorite son, [[Bowser Jr.]], who is disguised as an evil version of Mario, kidnaps Peach. Bowser himself eventually appears in the final boss battle of the game. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'', Bowser is the boss of the first world, which features a battle similar to that of ''Super Mario Bros.'' After being defeated, he falls into lava and is reduced to a skeleton called Dry Bowser. He is eventually restored by Bowser Jr. and acts as the final world's boss along with his son. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Bowser steals the Power Stars from [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina's]] Comet Observatory and kidnaps Peach, taking her to the center of the universe to recreate it, with the intention of taking over the universe. He also appears in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' as the final boss and primary antagonist of the game. After being defeated at the end, he grows to a much greater size, chasing Mario through the castle by breathing fireballs before Mario defeats him again. Bowser appears in the sequel ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', once again as the main antagonist. Here, however, Bowser has grown to giant size, requiring the player to dodge more powerful attacks such as [[Meteoroid#Meteor|meteors]] and bolts of lightning. Bowser also appears in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' as the main antagonist once again where he steals Peach and uses the [[Super Mario Bros. 3|Super Leaf]] to create tailed minions. Dry Bowser also returns in this game as well. Bowser also appeared in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' along with his Koopalings in order to capture Peach once more. Dry Bowser also makes an appearance in this game. Bowser returns as the main antagonist of ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U|New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[New Super Luigi U|Luigi U]]'' along with the Koopalings and his son, but this time, they invade Castle Toadstool. Bowser returns once again in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' as the main antagonist who is fought thrice, including as the final boss in a form known as Meowser, and this time, he will take over the Sprixie Kingdom by kidnapping the seven Sprixies so that he may steal the kingdom's treasures. He appears once more in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' as the main antagonist, kidnapping Peach so he can marry her. He goes about various kingdoms, stealing items for his use at the wedding. He also enlisted the aid of a band of anthropomorphic rabbits named \u201cThe Broodals\u201d as his wedding planners and also to stop Mario from thwarting Bowser's wedding plans. He serves as a boss midway through the game and also as the final boss. Once all Power Moons are obtained, an alternate final battle with Bowser can be unlocked.\n\nBowser appears as a child in various games. Known as '''Baby Bowser''' (not to be confused with [[Bowser Jr.]]), he antagonizes the Baby Mario brothers and various members of the [[Yoshi]] species. He first appears in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'' where [[List of Mario franchise characters#Kamek|Kamek]] predicts the brothers will become problems in the future, so he attempts to kidnap them. He appears yet again in the sequel ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', stealing the \"Super Happy Tree\" from a group of Yoshis. He appeared yet again in ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]'' as a playable character to recover his castle. Baby Bowser and his older self also appeared in ''[[Yoshi's New Island]]'' as the final boss. Baby Bowser makes an appearance in ''[[Yoshi's Woolly World]]'' as the [[main antagonist]]. Baby Bowser also appears alongside adult Bowser in early installments of the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, typically as a flunky for adult Bowser but also stealing coins from players on the game boards.\n\nIn ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', Bowser can now be placed in any non-castle level. Although he cannot throw hammers, a winged [[Bowser Jr.]] can be stacked on top of him for that purpose. A Bowser costume can also be unlocked for use in the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' style.\n\n====Other games====\n* Bowser makes various appearances in the ''Mario'' [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]].\n** In ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', he uses Mario and the Koopa Troop to become an ally only to reclaim his castle which is stolen by the main antagonist Smithy.\n** [[List of Mario role-playing games#Paper Mario series|The ''Paper Mario'' series]]\n*** In [[Paper Mario|the first ''Paper Mario'' game]], he is the primary antagonist, stealing an item called the Star Rod and using it to empower himself.\n*** He is a lesser antagonist in ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door|The Thousand-Year Door]]'' and a minor playable character, and is a major playable character in the sequel ''[[Super Paper Mario]]''.\n*** He also appeared in ''[[Paper Mario: Sticker Star|Sticker Star]]'' as the main antagonist where he invades the [[Sticker]] Fest ceremony and serves as the final boss with the sixth and final Royal Sticker. Unlike the other games, this is the first ''Paper Mario'' game he doesn't talk.\n*** He appears in ''[[Paper Mario: Color Splash|Color Splash]]'' as the main antagonist. However, unusually, he is unintentionally evil in this game, having been corrupted by poisonous black paint he accidentally created, turning him into Black Bowser. Under its influence, Black Bowser plans to cover Prism Island, as well the Mushroom Kingdom in black paint.\n** [[List of Mario role-playing games#Mario & Luigi series|The ''Mario & Luigi'' series]]\n*** He plays minor antagonistic and supporting roles in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga|Superstar Saga]]'', where he aids Mario and Luigi in battling the witch Cackletta. At one point in the story, he loses his memory after a big clunk on the head and becomes '''Rookie''', the assistant of master thief Popple. After regaining it, he gets possessed by Cackletta's spirit, becoming '''Bowletta'''.\n**** In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions|Bowser's Minions]]'' he reprises his role from the original ''Superstar Saga'', only that this time his minions are fighting back against [[Fawful]]'s forces to free their leader.\n*** Its prequel/sequel, ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time|Partners in Time]]'', features both Bowser and Baby Bowser as minor antagonists (the major antagonists are an alien race called the Shroobs). Baby Bowser races against the Bros. to rebuild an artifact called the Cobalt Star, while Bowser, after failing to kidnap an impostor Peach, is enhanced by the elder Princess Shroob and becomes the final boss called '''Shrowser'''. Both Bowser and Baby Bowser also team up at one point to fight the Bros.\n*** In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story|Bowser's Inside Story]]'' and its 3DS remake ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story#Remake|Bowser Jr.'s Journey]]'', Bowser is the main protagonist and a playable character, with Mario and Luigi supporting him from inside his body without his knowledge. Although he is one of the game's 3 protagonists, he is still fought twice in the game as a boss by the Mario Bros.\n*** In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team|Dream Team]]'', he appeared as the main antagonist and major boss, being fought three times, including as the final boss where he becomes Dreamy Bowser. He forms an alliance with the initial antagonist Antasma, but later betrays Antasma (which he intended to do for a while).\n*** ''[[Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam|Paper Jam]]'', a crossover 3DS game, features both Bowser and his paper counterpart (Paper Bowser), similar to '''''Partners in Time''''' where Bowser and Baby Bowser meet each other, who team up.\n* In ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'', he uses the power of the Vibe Scepter to capture Mario and Luigi (prompting Princess Peach herself to come to their rescue).\n* He serves as the final boss in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' in a battle on the roof of the titular mansion itself. Throughout the battle, it becomes apparent that this incarnation is [[King Boo]] inside a Bowser costume, which falls inert to the floor if Luigi is victorious.\n* Bowser also appears as a playable character in the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series and various [[List of Mario sports games|''Mario'' sports titles]], such as ''[[Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis|Tennis]]'' and all five ''[[List of Mario sports games#Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games series|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' installments. Dry Bowser also appears in some of the sports games occasionally as a playable character, being an independent character as opposed to being a form of Bowser.\n* He also appears frequently in the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series as a [[non-playable character]], with a space that, if players land on it, causes him to appear and either steal Stars or coins or make the players play his [[minigames]]. He finally gets to be playable in ''[[Mario Party 10]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Party]]''.\n* Bowser is a selectable character within ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|3DS/Wii U]]'', and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]''. In these games is a form called '''Giga Bowser''', a darker and more monstrous form with added power elements to his attacks. This form is an unplayable boss character in ''Melee'', and is fought in Adventure Mode and the final Event Match (alongside [[Mewtwo]] and [[Ganondorf]]), while in ''Brawl'', ''3DS'' and ''Wii U''', it serves as a temporary playable transformation with the Final Smash. This monstrous form appears again as a boss in the Classic Mode of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]''. In The Subspace Emissary from ''Brawl'', Bowser is unplayable for most of the story and only becomes playable after [[King Dedede]] defeats him in a duel.\n* In the Wii U version of ''[[Bayonetta|Bayonetta 1]]'' and ''[[Bayonetta 2|2]]'', Bowser makes a cameo in which Bayonetta can summon his fists and feet when wearing the game's unlockable Princesses Peach and Daisy costumes.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n* Bowser appears as one of the [[List of Skylanders characters#SuperChargers|Skylanders]] in ''[[Skylanders: SuperChargers]]'' as a fire element SuperCharger along with Spitfire and the SuperCharger version of Eruptor. His signature vehicle is the Clown Cruiser. He is only available on the Wii, the Wii U, and the Nintendo 3DS along with [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]].\n* Bowser also appears in the SNES version of [[SimCity (1989 video game)|''SimCity'']]; he is the one attacking the player's city during the monster attack disaster instead of the monster resembling Godzilla in the original PC release.\n* In the 1996 game ''[[Tetris Attack]]'', he is the final boss fought on Hard and the hidden Super Hard difficulties in both the SNES and GB versions.\n\n===In other media===\n[[File:Bowserwreckitralph.png|thumb|The \"Bad-Anon\" villain meeting from ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' features Bowser and other various well-known video game characters, including [[Ghosts (Pac-Man)|Clyde]], [[Doctor Eggman]], [[M.

The character is typically referred to as \"King Koopa\" rather than Bowser. His appearance in the cartoons was also different than his video game appearances. He had green skin and lacked his red hair and ability to breathe fire, although he did wield a magic wand similar to those seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.\n** Bowser uses various [[alter ego]]s in ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'' to match some of the episodes' titles.\n** In ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Bowser was assisted by his Koopa Kids, who received different names in the show.\n** In ''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'', Bowser and the Koopa Kids returned to fight Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, and Princess Peach in [[Super Mario (series)#Settings|Dinosaur Land]].\n* In 1989, Bowser, again referred to as \"King Koopa\", hosted a live action show entitled ''[[King Koopa's Kool Kartoons]]''. On this half-hour program, Bowser gives away prizes to the children.\n* Bowser appears as the antagonist in the ''Mario'' comics published as part of the [[Nintendo Comics System]].\n* In the 1993 [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|''Super Mario Bros.'']] movie, Bowser was played by [[Dennis Hopper]]. Here, he is President Koopa but is called \"King Koopa,\" who usurped the throne of the parallel-universe city of Dinohattan. Rather than a turtle, Koopa is a humanoid evolved from dinosaurs. Koopa is defeated when Mario and Luigi devolve him first into a [[Tyrannosaurus]] and then into primordial slime. The film version of Bowser/Koopa was met with significant criticism, and was mentioned by Hopper as the worst role he has ever played.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/dennis-hopper-speaks-candidly-about-his-role-as-king-koopa-110566.phtml|title=Dennis Hopper speaks candidly about his role as King Koopa|publisher=Destructoid|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>\n* Bowser was played by [[Christopher Hewett]] in the 1989 ''[[Ice Capades]]''.\n* Bowser also appears in the [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] game ''[[Hotel Mario]]'' as a final boss.\n* Bowser appears in the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' as one of the video game villains that attend the villain support group Bad-Anon. When Wreck-It Ralph mentions his interest in not being a villain anymore, Bowser reacts to this by [[Fire breathing|breathing fire]] similar to a spit take since he was drinking something at the time. Later near the end of the film, Ralph expresses his success of being a real hero and gaining some respect from Bowser and the other villains, who applaud him.\n* Bowser appears in two sketches in two separate episodes of the ''[[Mad (TV series)|MAD]]'' television series, voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]] both times. In the first sketch, \"Koopa Soup\", he advertises a new kind of soup served in a Koopa shell. In the second sketch, \"Franklin & Crash\", he is briefly seen trying to stop Mario from rescuing Peach before the castle he is guarding is crushed, then agrees to go buy some soda with Mario afterwards.\n* In late 2018, [[Bowsette]], a fan-made powered-up version of Bowser using the Super Crown power-up from ''[[New Super Mario Bros.
