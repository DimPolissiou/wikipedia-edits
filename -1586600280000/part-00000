Created in 1989 by [[Russell Morash]], the program was hosted by [[Norm Abram]], a regular fixture on Morash's television series ''[[This Old House]]''.\n\n==Overview==\n''The New Yankee Workshop'' featured the construction of woodworking projects, including workshop accessories, architectural details and furniture projects ranging from simple pieces to complex, high-quality reproductions of antique classic furniture. In the course of 21 seasons, approximately 235 projects were produced. In addition to furniture and cabinets, the show also focused on outdoor projects such as the building of a gazebo, shed, greenhouse, sailing boat, flag pole, mail box, cupola, and fences. He also goes to different places that are related to woodworking.\n\n==Theme song==\n''The New Yankee Workshop'' theme song consists of a fast-paced guitar tune with a harmonica sound.\n\n==Set design==\nThe shop where the show was produced is owned by Morash and is located on his property even though the viewer was given the impression that it was in Abram's backyard.\n\nThe shop is {{convert|936|sqft|m2}} in size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyankee.com/about.php |title=New Yankee Workshop - About The New Yankee Workshop |publisher=Newyankee.com |date=2000-01-30 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> The famous sliding barn door faces west. Along the west wall is the \"back bench\" and drill press. Along the south wall is the miter bench and storage unit, radial arm saw, and (not seen in episodes) a computer, a TV, and a small office area. The east wall of the shop has a staircase leading to a loft area, jig storage, horizontal edge sander, and dust collector. The north wall houses sheet goods, router table, bar clamps, Timesaver wide belt sander, planer, jointer, band saw, and various mobile tools. The center area of the shop consists of the table saw and associated outfeed tables as well as a large assembly table. In the northeast section of the building is a separate finishing room.\n\n==Cancellation==\nOn October 16, 2009, WGBH Boston announced that no further episodes of ''New Yankee Workshop'' would be produced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Potter |first=Tony |url=http://blogs.courant.com/roger_catlin_tv_eye/2009/10/norm-abram-closes-yankee-works.html |title=Norm Abram Closes 'Yankee Workshop' - Roger Catlin &#124; TV Eye |publisher=Blogs.courant.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> In remarking on the end of the show, Abram stated, \"We've had a great run, built challenging projects, met wonderful woodworkers and received loyal support from millions of viewers.\" Abram later claimed that the entire duration of the show was fully funded through underwriting and could have kept going, but he decided he had accomplished everything he wanted to do and wanted to spend more time with his family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84vE-2mSqtc |title=Festool Connect 2013 - Norm Abram |publisher=youtube.com |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-03-21}}</ref> Episodes continue to be available on The New Yankee Workshop website.\n\n==Award nominations==\n* '''[[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Service Show''', Russell Morash (1997, 1998, 2000)\n* '''Daytime Emmy Award for Single Camera Editing''', Gary Stephenson (1999)\n\n==Episodes==\n\nOver the course of its 21 seasons, at least 235 projects were built on ''New Yankee Workshop''.\n\n===Season 1 (1989)===\n*The closing credits for the first eight seasons of ''The New Yankee Workshop'' consisted of an exterior shot of the workshop with a sign in it, as we see [[Norm Abram]] closing the workshop door, and gets ready to go home and have dinner with his family.\n*On early episodes of this season, with the workshop door already opened, the dog is seen running away while Norm puts his tools away. For the rest of the entire season, after Norm puts his tools away, he moves the table, and the corner cupboard out of the way, and closes the workshop door.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! #\n!

Previous seasons had been numbered in three digit format using the season number (1-9) as the first digit, and the episode number making up the last two digits. So, for example, the third episode of the 4th season would be episode number 403. Starting with this season, episode numbers consisted of four digits with the first two digits representing the last two digits of the  year in which the season first aired and the last two digits representing the episode number within that season. So, the fourth episode of the 10th season, having first aired in 1998, would be episode number 9804.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! #\n!

Created in 1989 by [[Russell Morash]], the program was hosted by [[Norm Abram]], a regular fixture on Morash's television series ''[[This Old House]]''.\n\n==Overview==\n''The New Yankee Workshop'' featured the construction of woodworking projects, including workshop accessories, architectural details and furniture projects ranging from simple pieces to complex, high-quality reproductions of antique classic furniture. In the course of 21 seasons, approximately 235 projects were produced. In addition to furniture and cabinets, the show also focused on outdoor projects such as the building of a gazebo, shed, greenhouse, sailing boat, flag pole, mail box, cupola, and fences. He also goes to different places that are related to woodworking.\n\n==Theme song==\n''The New Yankee Workshop'' theme song consists of a fast-paced guitar tune with a harmonica sound.\n\n==Set design==\nThe shop where the show was produced is owned by Morash and is located on his property even though the viewer was given the impression that it was in Abram's backyard.\n\nThe shop is {{convert|936|sqft|m2}} in size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyankee.com/about.php |title=New Yankee Workshop - About The New Yankee Workshop |publisher=Newyankee.com |date=2000-01-30 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> The famous sliding barn door faces west. Along the west wall is the \"back bench\" and drill press. Along the south wall is the miter bench and storage unit, radial arm saw, and (not seen in episodes) a computer, a TV, and a small office area. The east wall of the shop has a staircase leading to a loft area, jig storage, horizontal edge sander, and dust collector. The north wall houses sheet goods, router table, bar clamps, Timesaver wide belt sander, planer, jointer, band saw, and various mobile tools. The center area of the shop consists of the table saw and associated outfeed tables as well as a large assembly table. In the northeast section of the building is a separate finishing room.\n\n==Cancellation==\nOn October 16, 2009, WGBH Boston announced that no further episodes of ''New Yankee Workshop'' would be produced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Potter |first=Tony |url=http://blogs.courant.com/roger_catlin_tv_eye/2009/10/norm-abram-closes-yankee-works.html |title=Norm Abram Closes 'Yankee Workshop' - Roger Catlin &#124; TV Eye |publisher=Blogs.courant.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> In remarking on the end of the show, Abram stated, \"We've had a great run, built challenging projects, met wonderful woodworkers and received loyal support from millions of viewers.\" Abram later claimed that the entire duration of the show was fully funded through underwriting and could have kept going, but he decided he had accomplished everything he wanted to do and wanted to spend more time with his family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84vE-2mSqtc |title=Festool Connect 2013 - Norm Abram |publisher=youtube.com |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-03-21}}</ref> Episodes continue to be available on The New Yankee Workshop website.\n\n==Award nominations==\n* '''[[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Service Show''', Russell Morash (1997, 1998, 2000)\n* '''Daytime Emmy Award for Single Camera Editing''', Gary Stephenson (1999)\n\n==Episodes==\n\nOver the course of its 21 seasons, at least 235 projects were built on ''New Yankee Workshop''.\n\n===Season 1 (1989)===\n*The closing credits for the first eight seasons of ''The New Yankee Workshop'' consisted of an exterior shot of the workshop with a sign in it, as we see [[Norm Abram]] closing the workshop door, and gets ready to go home and have dinner with his family.\n*On early episodes of this season, with the workshop door already opened, the dog is seen running away while Norm puts his tools away.

Previous seasons had been numbered in three digit format using the season number (1-9) as the first digit, and the episode number making up the last two digits. So, for example, the third episode of the 4th season would be episode number 403. Starting with this season, episode numbers consisted of four digits with the first two digits representing the last two digits of the  year in which the season first aired and the last two digits representing the episode number within that season. So, the fourth episode of the 10th season, having first aired in 1998, would be episode number 9804.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! #\n!

A high-end device, the Galaxy Alpha is Samsung's first smartphone to incorporate a metallic frame and more premium materials, although the remainder of its physical appearance still resembles previous models such as the [[Galaxy S5]]. It also incorporates the [[Qualcomm Snapdragon]] 801 or Samsung's new [[Exynos]] 5430 system-on-chip, which is the first mobile system-on-chip to use a 20 [[nanometer]] [[Semiconductor device fabrication|manufacturing process]]. However, the Galaxy Alpha received mixed reviews: although praised for its higher quality build and design in comparison to earlier Galaxy models' utilitarian plastic construction, the device was criticized for its modest specifications in comparison to the flagship Galaxy S5, with the Alpha being criticized for lacking water resistance, lower resolution screen (720p versus 1080p) and no MicroSD slot for expandable storage. The Alpha also debuted at a price too high for what some considered to be a \"mid-range\" smartphone, as although it did share the same Snapdragon 801 as the Galaxy S5, most earlier phones with the Snapdragon 801 had already been on the market for months and saw price drops. Following its launch, Samsung Electronics CEO JK Shin explained that the Alpha was \"built and designed based on the specific desires of the consumer market.\" The company touted that the Galaxy Alpha would mark a \"new design approach\" for Samsung's products, and that elements from the Alpha could appear on future Samsung models.<ref name=\"verge-unveil\">{{cite web|title=Samsung ditches all-plastic design with metal Galaxy Alpha|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/13/5997769/samsung-galaxy-alpha-release-date-pictures-video|website=The Verge|accessdate=16 August 2014|date=13 August 2014}}</ref> Its operating system is based on [[Android KitKat|Android 4.4.4 \"KitKat\"]] with its own version of [[TouchWiz]] UI.

A high-end device, the Galaxy Alpha is Samsung's first smartphone to incorporate a metallic frame and more premium materials, although the remainder of its physical appearance still resembles previous models such as the [[Galaxy S5]]. It also incorporates the [[Qualcomm Snapdragon]] 801 or Samsung's new [[Exynos]] 5430 system-on-chip, which is the first mobile system-on-chip to use a 20 [[nanometer]] [[Semiconductor device fabrication|manufacturing process]]. However, the Galaxy Alpha received mixed reviews: although praised for its higher quality build and design in comparison to earlier Galaxy models' utilitarian plastic construction, the device was criticized for its modest specifications in comparison to the flagship Galaxy S5, with the Alpha being criticized for lacking water resistance, lower resolution screen (720p versus 1080p) and no MicroSD slot for expandable storage. The Alpha also debuted at a price too high for what some considered to be a \"mid-range\" smartphone, as although it did share the same Snapdragon 801 as the Galaxy S5, most earlier phones with the Snapdragon 801 had already been on the market for months and saw price drops. Following its launch, Samsung Electronics CEO JK Shin explained that the Alpha was \"built and designed based on the specific desires of the consumer market.\" The company touted that the Galaxy Alpha would mark a \"new design approach\" for Samsung's products, and that elements from the Alpha could appear on future Samsung models.<ref name=\"verge-unveil\">{{cite web|title=Samsung ditches all-plastic design with metal Galaxy Alpha|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/13/5997769/samsung-galaxy-alpha-release-date-pictures-video|website=The Verge|accessdate=16 August 2014|date=13 August 2014}}</ref> Its operating system is based on [[Android KitKat|Android 4.4.4 \"KitKat\"]] with its own version of [[TouchWiz]] UI.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The Associated Press reported that a memorandum they had obtained showed that state regulators later agreed to fast-track a decision regarding the permit, despite environmental concerns from local residents. According to a businessman who lives near the proposed mine, regulators arrived within days of a meeting between Herbert and the coal company, and they felt pressure to make a quick decision. A Utah regulator said that this was not the case and that Herbert did not make any orders about whether to issue a permit. A spokeswoman for Herbert said that he was not aware of the donation, and that given his long-term support of the energy industry, it was not surprising that Alton made a donation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700006916/Utah-Gov-Gary-Herbert-given-10K-by-Alton-Coal-Development.html|title=Utah Gov.

In a tape that was made without his knowledge, as Herbert was trying to get donors to contribute his campaign finance money, Herbert said that he would go anywhere and do whatever it takes. \"I'm available.  I'm available Jones!\" he was heard saying on the tape.  Although he did say that there would be no [[quid pro quo]] he also said to the lobbyists in attendance that even if he did not agree with them that he would make them happy. Herbert's Republican challenger [[Jonathan E. Johnson]] said that he was so upset that he was physically shaking when he heard what Herbert did.  Herbert's Democratic opponent Mike Weinholtz promised that if he were elected to be Utah's governor, that he work to change the laws of Utah so that what Herbert did ''would'' be illegal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kutv.com/news/local/herbert-disappointed-with-himself-for-lobbyist-meeting-offer | title=KUTV 2 News: Governor Herbert admits to his own overzealousness in soliciting campaign contributions from lobbyists.

UDOT admitted that after \"adjustments\" were made to the scoring system, the 1.7 billion dollar contract was awarded to Provo River Constructors (PRC) after winning the bidding process by a single point.

He signed HB234, a bill which created an Inland Port Authority, and HB433, a bill to increase the extent of the port and the powers of the Port Authority. Earlier, Herbert had created an Inland Port Exploratory Committee to \"drive the development\" of an inland port in Utah. At the time, he stated that \"despite anti-trade, isolationist rhetoric at the national level, Utah remains committed to promoting international trade.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://business.utah.gov/news/governor-herbert-announces-formation-committee-inland-port/|title=Governor Herbert Announces Formation of Committee for an Inland Port.}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Campaign contributions===\n\n====2009-2010====\nMerit gave separate $25,000 checks to the Herbert campaign on November 2, 2009, and January 21, 2010, and Herbert and Lampropoulos met in October 2009. In December 2009, Merit got $4.4 million in tax credits. Lampropoulos has publicly endorsed Herbert and appears in a television commercial supporting Herbert's reelection bid.<ref name=\"ksl.com\"/>\n\nIn February 2010, ''[[The Deseret News]]'' reported that Herbert's campaign had received a $10,000 donation from Alton Coal Development, a coal company that had complained about delays in regulators issuing a permit for [[strip-mining]]. The Associated Press reported that a memorandum they had obtained showed that state regulators later agreed to fast-track a decision regarding the permit, despite environmental concerns from local residents. According to a businessman who lives near the proposed mine, regulators arrived within days of a meeting between Herbert and the coal company, and they felt pressure to make a quick decision. A Utah regulator said that this was not the case and that Herbert did not make any orders about whether to issue a permit. A spokeswoman for Herbert said that he was not aware of the donation, and that given his long-term support of the energy industry, it was not surprising that Alton made a donation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700006916/Utah-Gov-Gary-Herbert-given-10K-by-Alton-Coal-Development.html|title=Utah Gov.

Three teams vied for the contract. One gave the governor's campaign no money, another gave $35,000. The third team, Provo River Constructors, gave Herbert's campaign much more. Wadsworth Brothers Construction and partners Ames, Ralph Wadsworth and Fluor have contributed more than $80,000. Around the time most of those donations came in Guy Wadsworth got two meetings with the governor, apparently something no other bidding team had.  A month later, the state awarded the $1.725 billion contract to Provo River.<ref name=\"ksl.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=12360941|title=Large donations raise questions of influence in governor's race|accessdate=September 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nKSL TV also reported that Herbert had meetings with, and received donations from Fred Lampropoulos, CEO of Merit Medical, months before the Governor's Office of Economic Development awarded a tax break to Merit to expand its business in Utah.\n\n====2016====\nIn May 2016, Herbert was criticized for unethical campaign fund-raising activity.  In a tape that was made without his knowledge, as Herbert was trying to get donors to contribute his campaign finance money, Herbert said that he would go anywhere and do whatever it takes. \"I'm available.  I'm available Jones!\" he was heard saying on the tape.  Although he did say that there would be no [[quid pro quo]] he also said to the lobbyists in attendance that even if he did not agree with them that he would make them happy. Herbert's Republican challenger [[Jonathan E. Johnson]] said that he was so upset that he was physically shaking when he heard what Herbert did.  Herbert's Democratic opponent Mike Weinholtz promised that if he were elected to be Utah's governor, that he work to change the laws of Utah so that what Herbert did ''would'' be illegal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kutv.com/news/local/herbert-disappointed-with-himself-for-lobbyist-meeting-offer | title=KUTV 2 News: Governor Herbert admits to his own overzealousness in soliciting campaign contributions from lobbyists.

UDOT admitted that after \"adjustments\" were made to the scoring system, the 1.7 billion dollar contract was awarded to Provo River Constructors (PRC) after winning the bidding process by a single point. UDOT claimed the $13,000,000 payment to FSZ was to avoid any further or pending legal action. [[Peter Corroon]]'s campaign questioned whether this was related to a $87,500 donation made by PRC to Herbert's campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/50293824-90/njord-udot-provo-team.html.csp|title=Lehi firm won I-15 job after scoring tweaked |accessdate=September 21, 2010}}</ref> In a press conference on the same day, Herbert denied any knowledge of the $13,000,000 payoff to FSZ.

It is located conveniently, connecting four international borders i.e. [[China]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Bhutan]]. It also connects the North-East with the Indian mainland and is connected with all other districts of West Bengal. Located at the foothills of [[Eastern Himalaya]], Siliguri is a trading and transportation hub. Over time, Siliguri has grown from a village into a commercially progressive city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siligurismc.in/history-of-siliguri.php|title=History of Siliguri-SMC|accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref> Siliguri has been ruled by a few eminent dynasties like [[Chogyal]]s of the [[Chogyal|Namgyal dynasty]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=two|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607215048/http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=two|archive-date=20 May 2019|title=History of Darjeeling, Sikkim, Nepal|publisher=Official website of Nepal Army}}</ref> and its countless strategic offerings were realised after independence.<ref name=\"Siliguri municipal corporation - A historical profile\">{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvGAG4dYG7qzx6amp2EQYoeahm8EnuSK/view?usp=drivesdk.pdf|title=History of Siliguri|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Age history===\nAccording to Sailen Debnath, \"Siliguri\" means a stack of pebbles or stones. Till the 19th century this region was called as \"Shilchaguri\" when there was dense Dolka forest covering the area. Because of its appeal as an agricultural village, the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] captured Siliguri making it the southernmost part of their kingdom until the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] interfered. Because of it [[Kirati people|Kirati]] and [[Nepalis]] came to settle in this region.<ref name=\"History of Siliguri\">{{cite web|url=http://asiscwb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Siliguri-Handbook-1.pdf|website=asiscwb.org|title=Middle age history of Siliguri|accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt that time a river ([[Mahananda River|Mahananda]]) port, South of Siliguri in [[Phansidewa]] had an important role in having trade bond with [[Malda City|Malda]], [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]]. This riverine trade line was thus used by the [[Bhutan]]ese and [[Sikkimese people|Sikkimese]] to bring goods into their mainland.\n\n===Modern history===\nSiliguri started as a small area i.e. now Saktigarh, southern part of city, on the bank of [[Mahananda River]]. [[Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1815 signed between Britain-Nepal, changed the prospect of Siliguri. As it became a point of transit with [[Darjeeling]] hills and [[Nepal]] mainland. 1815 onwards, Siliguri started growing rapidly as a small city due to its strategic convenience of trade. In 1865, the British captured Darjeeling & the entire [[Dooars]] region to build tea plantations and export the produce to England. For easy exportation they introduced the [[Siliguri Town railway station]] which stands to this day, and introduced the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway|Toy train]] from the station to Darjeeling in 1880. This helped Siliguri to gain Sub-Divisional town status in 1907.<ref name=\"Historical profile of Siliguri\">{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvGAG4dYG7qzx6amp2EQYoeahm8EnuSK/view?usp=drivesdk.pdf|title=Modern history of Siliguri|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Siliguri Corridor]]\" was formed when [[Bengal]] was divided into [[West Bengal]] and [[East Pakistan]] (later Bangladesh) in 1947, with Sikkim later merging with India in 1975.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sikkim Voters OK Merger With India |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19750416&id=vDogAAAAIBAJ&pg=7319,25549 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=16 April 1975|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref> At this point many immigrants came to settle here for better facilities which led to an increased population.

The growth rate of Siliguri was 57.8% during 1971- 1981, considering this growth, Siliguri came under Integrated Urban Development Project program in 1981. Siliguri touched 46.83% of population growth rate in 1981\u20131991. A treaty between India and China for trade through [[Nathu La|Nathu La Pass]], has expedited development and prospects of Siliguri as an international transportation and logistics hub. Later in 1994 Siliguri built a Municipal corporation which has been responsible for the civic infrastructure and administration of the city of Siliguri. Siliguri has now achieved the status of becoming the [[List of metropolitan area in West Bengal|2nd]] largest metropolitan city in [[West Bengal]], after [[Kolkata]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliguri.gov.in/|title=Siliguri in recent days|website=www.siliguri.gov.in|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{OSM Location map\n| width=380| height=250| zoom=11\n| coord={{coord|26|44|0|N|88|22|30|E}}| float=left|caption='''Places in the North-eastern portion of Siliguri  subdivision in Darjeeling district'''<br/>CT: census town,  R: rural/ urban centre, MC: municipal corporation, F: facilities<br/>Abbreviations used in names \u2013 TG for Tea Garden, Jn RS for Junction Railway Station<br/>New Jalpaiguri Junction railway station is in Jalpaiguri district<br/>Owing to space constraints in the small map, the actual locations in a larger map may vary slightly\n|mark-coord1={{coord|26|41|30|N|88|22|25|E}}| label-pos1=right|label1= Bara Mohansingh| numbered1=CT| mark-title1= [[Bara Mohansingh]] (CT)|label-color1= #800000 |label-size1=11| mark-size1=12|shape1=l-circle|shape-color1= #A40000|shape-outline1=white|label-offset-x1=2\n|mark-coord2={{coord|26|42|20|N|88|19|30|E}}| label-pos2=right|label2=Bairatisal | numbered2=CT| mark-title2= [[Bairatisal]] (CT)\n|mark-coord3={{coord|26|42|51|N|88|22|20|E}}| label-pos3=right|label3= Jitu | numbered3=CT| mark-title3= [[Jitu, Siliguri]] (CT)\n|mark-coord4={{coord|26|45|30|N|88|25|6|E}}| label-pos4=left|label4= Kalkut | numbered4=CT| mark-title4= [[Kalkut, Siliguri]] (CT)\n|mark-coord5={{coord|26|42|10|N|88|24|30|E}}| label-pos5=right|label5= Mathapari | numbered5=CT| mark-title5= [[Mathapari]] (CT)\n|mark-coord6={{coord|26|44|10|N|88|21|0|E}}| label-pos6=left|label6= Tari | numbered6=CT| mark-title6= [[Tari, Siliguri]] (CT)\n|mark-coord7={{coord|26|44|0|N|88|24|0|E}}| label-pos7=right |label7=Siliguri| numbered7=MC| mark-title7= [[Siliguri]] (M)| shape-color7=black| label-size7=13|label-color7=black <!-- make the subject of the article stand out with black colors -->\n|mark-coord8={{coord|26|43|30|N|88|23|18|E}}| label-pos8=left|label8= Matigarahat| numbered8=R| mark-title8= [[Matigarahat]] (R)| shape-color8=#C42222\n|mark-coord9={{coord|26|47|0|N|88|23|7|E}}| label-pos9=left|label9= Mohorgon TG| numbered9=R| mark-title9= [[Mohorgon Tea Garden]] (R)| shape-color9=#C42222\n|mark-coord10={{coord|26|42|50|N|88|21|14|E}} | label-pos10=left|label10= University of North Bengal| numbered10=F| mark-title10= [[University of North Bengal]] (F) |shape-color10=#967117\n|mark-coord11={{coord|26|41|0|N|88|22|50|E}} | label-pos11=right|label11= North Bengal Medical College| numbered11=F| mark-title11= [[North Bengal Medical College]] (F) |shape-color11=#967117\n|mark-coord12={{coord|26|40|25|N|88|26|38|E}} | label-pos12=left|label12= New Jalpaiguri Jn RS| numbered12=F| mark-title12= [[New Jalpaiguri Junction railway station]] (F) |shape-color12=#967117\n|mark-coord13={{coord|26|45|10|N|88|19|10|E}}|label13= Balason River| label-color13 = #77A1CB| label-angle13=45| label-pos13=top| label-size13=10| mark-size13=0| mark-title13=none\n|mark-coord14={{coord|26|47|0|N|88|24|40|E}}|label14= Mahananda |labela14 = River| label-color14 = #77A1CB| label-angle14=40| label-pos14=top| label-size14=10| mark-size14=0| mark-title14=none}}\n\n===Location===\nSiliguri located at the foothills of the eastern Himalayas at a location of {{coord|26.71|N|88.43|E|}}.

It also connects the North-East with the Indian mainland and is connected with all other districts of West Bengal. Located at the foothills of [[Eastern Himalaya]], Siliguri is a trading and transportation hub.

Till the 19th century this region was called as \"Shilchaguri\" when there was dense Dolka forest covering the area. Because of its appeal as an agricultural village, the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] captured Siliguri making it the southernmost part of their kingdom until the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] interfered. Because of it [[Kirati people|Kirati]] and [[Nepalis]] came to settle in this region.<ref name=\"History of Siliguri\">{{cite web|url=http://asiscwb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Siliguri-Handbook-1.pdf|website=asiscwb.org|title=Middle age history of Siliguri|accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt that time a river ([[Mahananda River|Mahananda]]) port, South of Siliguri in [[Phansidewa]] had an important role in having trade bond with [[Malda City|Malda]], [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]]. This riverine trade line was thus used by the [[Bhutan]]ese and [[Sikkimese people|Sikkimese]] to bring goods into their mainland.\n\n===Modern history===\nSiliguri started as a small area i.e. now Saktigarh, southern part of city, on the bank of [[Mahananda River]]. [[Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1815 signed between Britain-Nepal, changed the prospect of Siliguri. As it became a point of transit with [[Darjeeling]] hills and [[Nepal]] mainland. 1815 onwards, Siliguri started growing rapidly as a small city due to its strategic convenience of trade. In 1865, the British captured Darjeeling & the entire [[Dooars]] region to build tea plantations and export the produce to England. For easy exportation they introduced the [[Siliguri Town railway station]] which stands to this day, and introduced the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway|Toy train]] from the station to Darjeeling in 1880. This helped Siliguri to gain Sub-Divisional town status in 1907.<ref name=\"Historical profile of Siliguri\">{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvGAG4dYG7qzx6amp2EQYoeahm8EnuSK/view?usp=drivesdk.pdf|title=Modern history of Siliguri|accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Siliguri Corridor]]\" was formed when [[Bengal]] was divided into [[West Bengal]] and [[East Pakistan]] (later Bangladesh) in 1947, with Sikkim later merging with India in 1975.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sikkim Voters OK Merger With India |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19750416&id=vDogAAAAIBAJ&pg=7319,25549 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=16 April 1975|access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref> At this point many immigrants came to settle here for better facilities which led to an increased population.

The growth rate of Siliguri was 57.8% during 1971- 1981, considering this growth, Siliguri came under Integrated Urban Development Project program in 1981. Siliguri touched 46.83% of population growth rate in 1981\u20131991. A treaty between India and China for trade through [[Nathu La|Nathu La Pass]], has expedited development and prospects of Siliguri as an international transportation and logistics hub. Later in 1994 Siliguri built a Municipal corporation which has been responsible for the civic infrastructure and administration of the city of Siliguri.

Built in 1902 by [[Chantiers de Penho\u00ebt]] in [[St. Nazaire]], [[France]], as '''''La\u00ebnnec''''', the ship served two French owners before she was sold to [[Germany|German]] interest in 1922 and renamed '''''Oldenburg'''''. In 1930, she was acquired by the Government of [[Finland]], refitted to serve as a [[school ship]] for the [[Finnish Navy]] and given her current name. ''Suomen Joutsen'' made eight long international voyages before the [[Second World War]] and later served in various support and supply roles during the war. From 1961 on she served as a stationary seamen's school for the [[Finnish Merchant Navy]]. In 1991, ''Suomen Joutsen'' was donated to the city of [[Turku]] and became a museum ship moored next to [[Forum Marinum]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== ''La\u00ebnnec'' (1902\u20131922) ===\n\nIn 1902, the French shipping company [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Armateurs Nantais]] ordered two 3,100-ton full rigged ships from [[Chantiers de Penho\u00ebt]] in [[Saint-Nazaire]]. The first ship, launched on 7 August 1902, was christened ''La\u00ebnnec'' after [[Ren\u00e9 Laennec]], a French doctor and inventor of the [[stethoscope]]. On 18 September 1902 she was followed by the second ship, named ''[[Haudaudine]]'' after [[Pierre Haudaudine]], which was lost off the coast of [[New Caledonia]] on 3 January 1905.<ref name=\"haudaudine\">[http://www.paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TC19050105.2.12.4&e=-------10--1----2%22james+temple+fisher%22-- Shipwreck]. Colonist, 5 January 1905. {{retrieved | accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref> On 23 October 1902 ''La\u00ebnnec'' left Saint-Nazaire and headed to [[Cardiff]], [[England]], to load coal bound for [[Iquique]], [[Chile]].<ref name=\"laennec1\">Auvinen (2002), pages 9\u201314.</ref><ref name=\"laennec2\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 10\u201311.</ref>\n\n''La\u00ebnnec'' was almost sunk on her maiden voyage when she collided with an English [[steam ship]] [[SS Penzance|''Penzance'']] in the [[Bay of Biscay]], sinking the fully laden steamer within minutes. ''La\u00ebnnec'', also seriously damaged, was towed to [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] for repairs. One of the reasons for the incident was that she was not carrying enough [[sailing ballast]] on her voyage from the shipyard, and as a result her rudder was not completely submerged in water, significantly reducing the maneuverability of the ship. Towards the end of the nine-month voyage, while carrying [[potassium nitrate]] from Chile to [[Bremerhaven]], [[Germany]], a minor [[mutiny]] broke out when four crew members disobeyed orders from Captain Turb\u00e9.<ref name=\"laennec1\" />\n\nIn 1906<ref name=\"note1\" group=\"note\">1920 according to some sources.</ref> ''La\u00ebnnec'' was sold to a French shipping company [[Compagnie Plisson]]. She made several voyages across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and around [[Kap Horn]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], and around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to [[Australia]] under the command of Captain [[Achille Guriec]]. On her way back to Europe she carried wheat or potassium nitrate.<ref name=\"laennec1\" />\n\nOn 12 December 1911, while unloading potassium nitrate at the port of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], [[Spain]], ''La\u00ebnnec'' was severely damaged when a storm pushed her against the pier and ripped the ship from her moorings, causing the full rigged ship to drift against a Dutch steam ship [[SS Rhehania|''Rhehania'']]. As there was no shipyard large enough to accommodate ''La\u00ebnnec'' in Santander, the ship was emptied and inclined until her damaged hull plating was exposed and could be repaired within the harbour. The repairs took 20 days and the ship, which by that time had become a popular attraction for the local people, left Spain on 1 February 1912.<ref name=\"laennec1\" /> In 1914 the [[main mast]] of ''La\u00ebnnec'' broke off and fell over the starboard side when the ship was struck by a heavy storm in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]]. She was towed to [[Brest, France|Brest]] for repairs.<ref name=\"laennec2\" /> On 12 June 1916 Captain Guriec died onboard ''La\u00ebnnec'' while the ship was passing the Cape of Good Hope on her way back to Europe. The command was assumed by the [[first mate]] who, according to some sources, also perished before the ship arrived in England. Later the command was given to Captain [[\u00c9mile Delano\u00eb]].<ref name=\"laennec1\" />\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] broke out, ''La\u00ebnnec'' was equipped with two deck guns. Due to the presence of German [[U-boat]]s in Europe, the ship spent the war years trading in the United States East Coast. After the war, she arrived back to her home port, Saint-Nazaire, after a 150-day voyage from Australia to be stripped and laid up. On 1 December 1920 ''La\u00ebnnec'' was put for sale.<ref name=\"laennec1\" />\n\n=== ''Oldenburg'' (1922\u20131930) ===\n[[File:Oldenburg Troense.jpg|thumb|left|''Oldenburg'', the school ship of the German merchant navy.]]\nIn late November 1922, after having been laid up for two years, ''La\u00ebnnec'' was sold to a German shipping company [[H. H. Schmidt & Co.]] from [[Hamburg]]. After refitting she was renamed ''Oldenburg'' after the city of [[Oldenburg]] and, through an agreement with the German school ship association [[Deutscher Schulschiffverein]], she became a school ship for the German merchant navy.<ref name=\"oldenburg1\">Auvinen (2002), pages 15\u201317.</ref> Among the men who received their training onboard ''Oldenburg'' over the years was the German U-boat ace [[G\u00fcnther Prien]].\n\nIn 1925, while rounding Kap Horn, ''Oldenburg'' lost her main mast in a storm and had to seek shelter due to damaged rigging. After emergency repairs in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], she crossed the Atlantic and headed back to Hamburg. However, due to strong easterly winds she was forced to pass the [[British Isles]] on the northern side instead of the [[English Channel]]. 78 days after leaving the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] estuary, ''Oldenburg'' was taken into tow by a German tugboat and towed to Hamburg.<ref name=\"oldenburg1\" />\n\nIn 1928 ''Oldenburg'' was sold to another German shipping company, [[Seefart Segelschiffs-Reederei GmbH]] from [[Bremen]]. In 1930, on her last voyage under the German flag, ''Oldenburg'' was almost lost when the cargo of [[phosphate]] shifted in heavy weather. After two weeks in a heavy storm, the longitudinal bulkhead gave way and the ship assumed a list of 55 degrees. Lifeboats, spare [[yard (sailing)|yards]] and the kitchen stove were lost overboard. However, the crew managed to righten the ship and sail her to [[Malm\u00f6]], [[Sweden]]. After unloading the ship was moved to Bremerhaven to be laid up.<ref name=\"oldenburg1\" />\n\n=== ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' (1930\u2013) ===\n\n==== Acquisition and refitting ====\n\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen in Uusikaupunki.jpg|thumb|left|''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' during outfitting in Uusikaupunki, with ''Osmo'' in the foreground]]\n\nAlthough the school ship was left out from the [[Finnish Naval Act of 1927]], the Finnish Navy decided to keep looking for a suitable vessel and purchase it separately from the major fleet renewal program. Over the years, opinions both in favor and against a school ship had been presented, but it was generally agreed that such vessel would be in many ways beneficial for the Finnish Navy. Initially there was also disagreement about the type of the ship \u2014 some were in favor of a modern steam ship that could be used in the local waters while the others preferred a traditional sailing ship that would teach the cadets traditional seaman skills and bring them closer to [[merchant mariner]]s. The latter was also recommended by foreign naval officials, and finally the Finnish Navy agreed on a sailing ship. This was further helped by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] that had brought the prices down, and the fact that windjammers had been largely replaced by steam ships.<ref name=\"aalste9\" />\n\nIn April 1930, the [[Parliament of Finland]] allotted 4,000,000 [[Finnish markka]]s for procuring a second-hand full-rigged ship and refitting it as a school ship for the Finnish Navy. During the summer of 1930, the Finnish officials inspected a number of Finnish and foreign ships that were offered for sale. These included [[Gustav Erikson]]'s four-masted [[barque]]s [[Pommern (ship)|''Pommern'']] and ''[[Herzogin Cecilie]]'', and several other ships, but all were deemed either too large or too dilapidated. In the end, the most suitable candidate came from Germany where ''Oldenburg'', a 28-year-old former school ship of the German merchant navy, was offered for sale.<ref name=\"aalste9\">Aalste et al. (1989), page 9.</ref> After inspecting the ship in Bremen, the Finnish officials purchased her in August 1930 and the German crew sailed the ship to Helsinki.<ref name=\"laennec2\" /><ref name=\"auvinen18-19\">Auvinen (2002), pages 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nAfter having been handed over to the Finnish Navy, ''Oldenburg'' was towed to [[Uusikaupunki]] for refitting. The work, which began in late 1930 and continued until November 1931, included replacing part of the bottom plating, building an additional tweendeck, refurbishing the rigging, painting the whole ship and rebuilding her cargo holds to accommodate up to 180 men. The shipyard was responsible for the structural alterations while 62 future crew members and cadets of the Finnish Navy were responsible for the other tasks, including carrying 1,200 tons of stones to the ship as sailing ballast.<ref name=\"tekn1\" />\n\nOn 1 November 1931, after a number of delays, ''Oldenburg'' was renamed ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' (Swan of Finland) after ''[[Finska Svan]]'', a Swedish 16th century warship that took part in the [[Action of 7 July 1565|naval action of 7{{nbsp}}July{{nbsp}}1565]] between Sweden and Denmark. After launching, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' broke her moorings in the strong breeze and damaged two ships, gunboat [[Finnish gunboat Karjala|''Karjala'']] and ''Osmo'', a laid-up full rigged ship built in 1869, before she was brought under control. On 4 November 1931, she left the shipyard for Helsinki, under tow and escorted by minelayer [[Finnish minelayer Louhi|''M-1'']].<ref name=\"aalste18\">Aalste et al. (1989), page 18.</ref>\n\n==== School ship (1931\u20131939) ====\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen first voyage.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' leaving for her first voyage in December 1931 with snow covering the decks.]]\nDue to delays during the refitting and later problems with the steam heating system, the first voyage of ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was delayed until late December. Captain [[Arvo Lieto]] proposed postponing the departure until the next autumn as Christmas was drawing near and the sea was already freezing, but on 21 December 1931 [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud|President P. E. Svinhufvud]] ordered the ship to begin her first international school sailing under the Finnish flag. ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was towed to the sea on the following day, but she had to wait for favourable winds outside [[Porkkala]] until 28 December, at which point she had already been grounded once. The streak of bad luck continued when the ship was anchored in [[Trongisv\u00e1gsfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur]] in [[Su\u00f0uroy]], [[Faroe Islands]], after stopping to purchase more lubrication oil at [[Trongisv\u00e1gur]]. ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' dragged her anchors in a storm measuring 11\u201312 on the [[Beaufort scale]], drifting stern first towards the shore. After two trawlers and a tugboat managed to get the full rigged ship safely to the harbour, it was found out that the rudder had been damaged and the ship was towed to England for drydocking. After repairs, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' continued to the [[Canary Islands]], where she remained for three weeks while Captain Lieto was relieved of command and replaced by [[John Konkola]], who served as the captain of the school ship for six full and two partial voyages. From the Canary Islands, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' headed south, but the refrigeration system failed {{convert|500|km}} before the [[Equator]] and she had to turn back before a [[line-crossing ceremony]] could be held. However, the crew got some consolation when news about the end of [[prohibition in Finland]] reached the ship while she was sailing towards Finland in the Baltic Sea. ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' arrived in Finland on 22 May 1932 and was drydocked at [[Suomenlinna]] shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"first\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 27\u201333.</ref>\n\nThe second voyage of ''Suomen Joutsen'' began on 18 October 1932, and after stopping briefly in the Canady Islands and [[Cape Verde]], she crossed the Equator on 11 December for the first time flying the Finnish flag. On 24 December, the crew celebrated traditional Finnish Christmas outside [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], and arrived at the port on the following morning. The visit of \"Cisne Blanco de Finlandia\", the white swan of Finland, was widely covered in local newspapers. From Rio de Janeiro, ''Suomen Joutsen'' continued her voyage to [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and then, against her original sailing plan, to [[Buenos Aires]]. After leaving [[Argentine]] and visiting a number of ports in the Caribbean, ''Suomen Joutsen'' crossed the Atlantic and finally arrived in Finland on 3 May 1933. On the way back, her crew caught a number of [[sea turtles]] for the [[Helsinki Zoo]].<ref name=\"second\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 34\u201337</ref>\n\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen 1934.jpg|thumb|right|''Suomen Joutsen'' in a storm on her third voyage in April 1934.]]\nOn her third international sailing, ''Suomen Joutsen'' left Helsinki on 1 November 1933 and headed to the [[Mediterranean]], where she visited the ports of [[Marseille]], [[Alexandria]] and [[Naples]]. While heading towards [[Gibraltar]] on her way to the Atlantic, an English steam ship tauntingly offered to tow the Finnish full rigged ship which was sailing slowly [[points of sail|close to the wind]]. However, shortly afterwards the wind changed its direction and ''Suomen Joutsen'' overtook the steamer with a towing line hanging from the stern [[hawsehole]], offering to provide assistance for the slower ship. After stopping briefly at the Canary Islands, the ship crossed the Atlantic and arrived in Haiti on 10 March 1934 after 25 days of sailing. The return voyage began six days later. On 6 April, while in the middle of the Northern Atlantic, ''Suomen Joutsen'' was hit by hurricane-force winds that caused the ship to list almost 56 degrees. She survived the worst storm of her career without major damage and arrived in Helsinki on 16 May 1934.<ref name=\"third\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 38\u201346</ref>\n\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen 4th.jpg|thumb|left|''Suomen Joutsen'' during preparations for her fourth voyage.]]\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen seen from Rex.jpg|thumb|150px|right|''Suomen Joutsen'' photographed from the passing [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']] on 7 December 1934.]]\n''Suomen Joutsen'' began her fourth voyage on 30 October 1934 and arrived at her first stop, [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] in [[Spain]], in late November. While sailing towards the [[Greece|Greek]] port city of [[Piraeus]] outside [[Sardinia]] on 7 December, she was overtaken by the Italian 51,000-ton [[ocean liner]] [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']] which passed ''Suomen Joutsen'' at full speed of {{convert|31|kn}} from a distance of only {{convert|50|m|yd|abbr=off}}. Although the holder of the [[Blue Riband]] was a sight to behold, seeing a full rigged ship underway in the open seas was also becoming a rare treat. After visiting various ports in the Mediterranean, the ship returned to the Atlantic and stopped briefly at Ponta Delgada, but crossed neither the Atlantic nor the Equator. ''Suomen Joutsen'' returned to Helsinki on 3 May 1935.<ref name=\"fourth\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 47\u201351.</ref><ref name=\"fourth2\">Auvinen (2002), page 101.</ref>\n\nThe fifth voyage of ''Suomen Joutsen'' was the longest the ship had ever done under the Finnish flag. After leaving Helsinki on 9 October 1935, the ship stopped briefly at [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], and then continued across the Atlantic, eventually arriving in the [[Panama canal]] on 26 December. It took eleven and a half hours to transit the {{convert|81|km|mi|adj=on}} canal. After leaving Panama behind, ''Suomen Joutsen'' headed south and crossed the Equator on 4 January 1936 with appropriate ceremonies. Later the ship stopped at [[Callao]] in [[Peru]] and [[Valparaiso]] in [[Chile]], where five men escaped after a local barkeeper had offered them full upkeep for playing at his bar. The men were later caught by local officials and returned to Finland, where they were sentenced for six months in prison. After leaving Chile, ''Suomen Joutsen'' sailed around the [[Cape Horn]] without major difficulties and arrived in Buenos Aires on 21 March. From Argentine, the ship continued to Rio de Janeiro, where she encountered the Brazilian school ship ''[[Almirante Saldanha]]'', whose purchase had been inspired by the previous visit of the white swan of Finland. ''Suomen Joutsen'' sailed out on 14 April and due to heavy weather and headwinds, it took seven weeks to reach the Azores. On 9 May, Captain Konkola turned 50 and after the crew had sung \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\" at 6:30 in the morning, he stuck his head out from the cabin door and yelled \"Steward, give them [[Distilled beverage|booze]]!\" ''Suomen Joutsen'' arrived in Helsinki on 4 July 1936. After a number of disagreements regarding the use of tugboats in the foreign ports, Captain Konkola decided to sail the full rigged ship all the way to the harbour, crossing the narrow [[Kustaanmiekka|Kustaanmiekka strait]] at full sail. Finally, when the bow had already been moored at [[Katajanokka]], he allowed the tugboat to push the stern against the pier and the fifth voyage was over.<ref name=\"fifth\">Aalste et al. (1989), pp. 55\u201365.</ref>\n\nOn her sixth voyage, the most important stop of ''Suomen Joutsen'' was [[New York City]], where the ship arrived on 3 March 1937. Prior to this, the ship had visited Portugal, [[Senegal]] and a number of ports in the Caribbean after leaving Helsinki on 2 November 1936. However, the ship's first and only visit to the [[United States]] under the Finnish flag was an important milestone and a major media event. When the ship was sailing up the [[Hudson River]], an American film crew came on board to capture her arrival, and ''Suomen Joutsen'' remained the center of attention for the six days she was moored at the western end of the [[35th Street (Manhattan)|35th Street]]. When the ship left New York, a member of the crew was accidentally left on the shore. However, he managed to talk a local tugboat captain to take him back to the school ship and, for solving the problem on his own initiative, was left without punishment. After stopping at [[Oslo]], ''Suomen Joutsen'' arrived in Helsinki on the [[May Day]] of 1936. Among the first people to leave the ship was a man carrying a living [[crocodile]] under his arm, captured for the Helsinki Zoo.<ref name=\"seventh\">Aalste et al. (1989), pp. 66\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe seventh voyage of ''Suomen Joutsen'' began on 20 October 1937 and took the ship first across the Atlantic to South America. After calling Montevideo, she continued east to [[Cape Town]], stopping at [[Tristan da Cunha]] along the way. The seventh voyage has often been called the unluckiest one as three crew members were lost before the ship arrived back in Finland on 12 May 1938. On 7 February, a seaman fell from the bow mast and was buried at sea on the following day. On the way to Cape Town, a sergeant became ill and later died in a hospital in [[South Africa]] on 10 March. On 10 May, a member of the regular crew fell to the sea while painting the hull when the ship was underway in the Baltic Sea. Many thought that the deaths were due to the crew killing three [[albatross]]es earlier in the voyage. Finally, when ''Suomen Joutsen'' was outside Helsinki, a small airplane flew too close to the ship and crashed into the sea, but the pilots were rescued.<ref name=\"seventh2\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 77\u201383</ref><ref>Auvinen (2002), pp. 221\u2013223.</ref>\n\n''Suomen Joutsen'' left for her eighth and last international voyage on 27 October 1938. After stopping at Copenhagen for provisions and clearing the English Channel \u2014 and almost colliding with the Polish passenger ship [[MS Pi\u0142sudski|''Pi\u0142sudski'']] \u2014 she continued to the [[Bay of Biscay]]. However, {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=on}} waves forced ''Suomen Joutsen'' to turn back on 23 November and head to [[Bordeaux]] to wait for the weather to clear. Captain Konkola, concerned about his ailing health, was relieved of his duty and replaced by [[Unto Voionmaa]] on 3 December 1938. Under his command, ''Suomen Joutsen'' crossed the Atlantic twice, calling the ports of [[Pernambuco]] in Brazil and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] in [[Puerto Rico]]. On her last stop at [[Rotterdam]], there were already signs of a [[World War II|major conflict]] in the air, and had the war started before the ship arrived in Finland, she would have headed to the United Kingdom. ''Suomen Joutsen'' arrived in Helsinki on 22 April 1939, after which she never left the Baltic Sea again.<ref name=\"eight\">Aalste et al.

She was used as a [[submarine tender|supply ship]] for the Finnish submarine fleet within the Finnish archipelago. When the [[Winter War]] broke out on 30 November 1939, she was stationed in [[H\u00f6gs\u00e5ra]] with the submarines and [[coastal defence ship]]s [[Finnish coastal defence ship V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen|''V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'']] and [[Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen|''Ilmarinen'']]. After three [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scout planes flew over the ships, the fleet moved hastily to another safe location near [[Nagu]] only hours before eight four-engined enemy bombers overflew the previous anchorage. During the first weeks of the war, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was assigned to \"moving supply depot\" under the [[Archipelago Sea Fleet]] that consisted of the full rigged ship and a number of barges and tugboats. She served in this task until the Winter War ended with the signing of the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] on 13 March 1940. During the [[Interim Peace]] she was stationed in [[Naantali]].<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\">Auvinen (2002), pp. 273\u2013276.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] started on 25 June 1941, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' resumed her old tasks as a moving supply depot under the Archipelago Sea Fleet. Since the Finnish Navy now had a dedicated submarine tender, [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|icebreaker ''Sisu'']], the former school ship was relegated to supply [[motor torpedo boat]]s. After the war ended on 19 September 1944, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was used as an accommodation ship in Turku.<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" />\n\nDuring the war, around 150 men were stationed on ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen''. The ship was lightly armed with only two machine guns and around 40 rifles.<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" /> She survived the war largely intact, with only minor [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] damage from Soviet air raids.<ref>Aalste et al.

She served in this task until the mine clearance was finished in 1948, but was afterwards used as an accommodation and supply ship for different branches of the Finnish Navy. In 1955\u20131959 she was stationed in [[Upinniemi]].<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" />\n\nWhile ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' served as a supply ship for the minesweeping fleet, her crew rebuilt the rigging dismantled before the war and the school ship spent a couple of days sailing in the Baltic Sea in late 1948. Although there were plans to reactivate her as a school ship for either the Finnish Navy or the Finnish Merchant Fleet, or both, there were issues with her [[naval ensign]] \u2014 as a naval school ship she would not be allowed to carry cargo or be crewed by civilians, but a civilian flag would force her to pay expensive harbour fees. There was also no longer need for a civilian full rigged school ship. In 1949\u20131951, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' conducted a number of short training and promotional sailings in the Baltic Sea, but never ventured further than the southern tip of [[Gotland]].<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" /><ref name=\"aalste93-94\">Aalste et al. (1989), p. 93\u201394.</ref>\n\nAlthough everything was ready for the first post-war school sailing, [[Finnish President|President]] [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi|J. K. Paasikivi]] was against the voyage \u2014 sailing a full rigged ship so soon after the war while the [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union]] were still being paid was deemed too flamboyant. It was Paasikivi who, as the director of the Finnish Export Society in the 1930s, had been one of the major supporters of ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen''. The danger of stray naval mines had also not completely disappeared.<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" /><ref name=\"aalste93-94\" /> In 1961, the Finnish Navy purchased [[HMS Porlock Bay (K650)|HMS ''Porlock Bay'']], a [[Bay class frigate|''Bay'' class frigate]], as the new school ship.<ref name=\"auvinen277-278\">Auvinen (2002), pp. 277\u2013278.</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==== Seamen's school (1961\u20131991) ====\n\nIn the late 1940s, the [[Finnish Seamen's Union]] proposed the Finnish government that ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' should be turned into a stationary seamen's school. As nothing happened, the Union renewed its proposal with a different tone in the late 1950s when it learned that the government was planning to sell the old full rigged ship for German scrap dealers and, in fact, the first payment had already been made. The Union gave its ultimatum on 29 April 1959 and when the government did not react, the crews of the inspection ships under the Finnish Maritime Administration went on a strike on 2 May. Before the action could spread, the government acceded and it was agreed that ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' would be stationed in Turku. However, due to intentional delays nothing happened until [[Niilo W\u00e4ll\u00e4ri]], the leader of the Finnish Seamen's Union, presented his final ultimatum on 13 January 1960: if the preparations to turn ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' into a seamen's school did not begin immediately, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers would go into strike on 15 January, effectively stopping all foreign trade. Two days later, [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|icebreaker ''Sampo'']] began towing the former school ship through the icefields towards Turku, where the convoy arrived on 17 January 1960.<ref name=\"aalste95-96\">Aalste et al.

Two new classrooms were also built on the deck, slightly altering the appearance of the vessel. The first classes were held on 1 March 1961, and on 4 May the school was officially opened. On the same day, the naval ensign was replaced with the civilian flag.<ref>Aalste et al.

In the 1980s, the facilities on board the school ship were becoming too small and increasingly obsolete, and there were talks about closing the school by the end of the decade. There was also discussion about turning ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' to a museum ship. The school closed its doors in 1988 and three years later ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was handed over to the city of Turku.<ref name=\"auvinen278\">Auvinen (2002), p. 278.</ref>\n\n==== Museum ship (1991\u2013) ====\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen at night 2005.jpg|thumb|left|''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' at her present location next to [[Forum Marinum]].]]\n\n''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' has been open to the public since 1991.

Her [[standing rigging|standing]] and [[running rigging]] consist of over {{convert|30|km}} of manilla ropes and steel cables. The typical sailing speed of ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was around {{convert|12|kn}}, but once in the [[North Sea]] she reached a record speed of {{convert|16.4|kn}} with only [[topsail]]s and the [[foresail]].<ref name=\"laennec1\" /><ref name=\"tekn1\" />\n\nThe [[length overall|overall length]] of ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' is {{convert|96|m|ftin}}.

When she was carrying cargo, her tonnage was 2,393 [[register ton]]s [[gross register tonnage|gross]], 1,734 register tons [[net register tonnage|net]] and 3,100 tons [[deadweight tonnage|deadweight]].<ref name=\"tonnage\" group=\"note\" /> The ship drew {{convert|6.35|m|ftin}} of water when loaded, but as a school ship she sailed with a ballast draft of only {{convert|5.15|m|ftin}}. With 1,200 tons of stones as [[sailing ballast]], her displacement was 2,900 tons and [[metacentric height]] {{convert|0.699|m|ftin}}. Later some of the stone ballast was replaced with concrete and iron.<ref>Juutilainen (1942).</ref> Internally her hull was divided into five watertight compartments.<ref name=\"laennec1\" /><ref name=\"tekn1\" />\n\nWhen ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was converted to a school ship for the Finnish Navy, her general arrangements were changed considerably in order to accommodate up to 180 men on long international voyages. In addition to living quarters, bathrooms and toilets, this included building kitchens and six refrigerated rooms for provisions, workshops for a carpenter, shoemaker and tailor, laundry room, hospital with ten beds and a small isolation ward, classroom, library, canteen, and more storage space for sails, ropes, paint, sand and coal. Nine freshwater tanks with a total capacity of 206 tons were also built, but in order to conserve water a traditional Finnish [[sauna]] was not provided. Instead, hot steam could be diverted into the washing rooms under the forecastle.<ref name=\"tekn1\" />\n\nOriginally built without auxiliary propulsion, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was refitted with two [[Skandia (engine)|Skandia]] [[hot bulb engine]]s, each producing 200&nbsp;hp, coupled to three-bladed fixed pitch propellers. The twin-shaft propulsion arrangement was very uncommon at that time. In practice the engines were found out to be underpowered, but they could still be used to assist manoeuvering in ports and in heavy weather. Two generators (5&nbsp;kW and 8&nbsp;kW) were added to produce electricity for about three hundred lights. While ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' had a steam boiler for central heating, she did not have steam winches \u2014 anchors and yards were lifted using a [[Capstan (nautical)|manual capstan]].<ref name=\"tekn1\" />\n{{-}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Suomen Joutsen (ship, 1902)|''Suomen Joutsen''}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book |last= Auvinen |first= Visa |title= Leijonalippu merell\u00e4 |publisher=Satakunnan Kirjateollisuus Oy| location = Pori |year= 1983 |isbn= 951-95781-1-0 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Auvinen|first=Visa|title=Suomen Joutsen \u2014 Onnekas satavuotias|publisher=TS-Yhtym\u00e4 Oy|year=2002|isbn=951-9129-48-0}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Aalste|first1=Juhani|last2=Aittola|first2=Heikki|last3=Mauno|first3=Jukka|title=Suomen Joutsen|publisher=Merikustannus Oy|year=1989|isbn=951-95457-2-7}}\n*{{cite book |last=Juutilainen |first=Martti |title=Sellainen oli retkemme - Suomen Joutsenen matkat maailman merill\u00e4|publisher=Fennia|year=1942}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.forum-marinum.fi/nayttelyt-ja-museoalukset/museolaivat/fregatti-suomen-joutsen Suomen Joutsen at Forum Marinum]\n\n{{Oldest surviving ships (pre-1919)}}\n\n{{coord|60|26|10|N|22|14|13|E|display=title|region:FI_type:landmark_source:dewiki}}\n[[Category:Full-rigged ships]]\n[[Category:Training ships]]\n[[Category:Ships of the Finnish Navy]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Finland]]\n[[Category:Tall ships of France]]\n[[Category:Tall ships of Germany]]\n[[Category:Tall ships of Finland]]\n[[Category:1902 ships]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Turku]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Turku]]\n", "text_old": "{|{{Infobox ship begin |display title=ital}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n| Ship image=[[File:Suomen Joutsen 1932.jpg|300px|Suomen Joutsen in 1932]]\n| Ship caption=''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' anchored outside Helsinki in 1932.\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n| Hide header=\n| Ship country=\n| Ship flag={{flag|France}}\n| Ship name=''La\u00ebnnec''\n| Ship namesake=[[Ren\u00e9 Laennec]]\n| Ship owner=*[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Armateurs Nantais]] (1902\u20131906<ref name=\"note1\" group=\"note\" />)\n*[[Compagnie Plisson]] (1906\u20131922)\n| Ship registry=[[Saint-Nazaire]], {{FRA}}\n| Ship route=\n| Ship ordered=\n| Ship builder=[[Chantiers de Penho\u00ebt]], Saint-Nazaire, France\n| Ship original cost=\n| Ship way number=\n| Ship laid down=\n| Ship launched=7 August 1902\n| Ship completed=\n| Ship maiden voyage=23 October 1902\n| Ship in service=1902\u20131920\n| Ship homeport=\n| Ship identification=\n| Ship fate=Sold to Germany in 1922\n| Ship notes=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n| Hide header=title\n| Ship country=\n| Ship flag={{flag|Weimar Republic}}\n| Ship name=''Oldenburg''\n| Ship namesake=[[Oldenburg|City of Oldenburg]]\n| Ship owner=*[[H.

Built in 1902 by [[Chantiers de Penho\u00ebt]] in [[St. Nazaire]], [[France]], as '''''La\u00ebnnec''''', the ship served two French owners before she was sold to [[Germany|German]] interest in 1922 and renamed '''''Oldenburg'''''. In 1930, she was acquired by the Government of [[Finland]], refitted to serve as a [[school ship]] for the [[Finnish Navy]] and given her current name. ''Suomen Joutsen'' made eight long international voyages before the [[Second World War]] and later served in various support and supply roles during the war. From 1961 on she served as a stationary seamen's school for the [[Finnish Merchant Navy]]. In 1991, ''Suomen Joutsen'' was donated to the city of [[Turku]] and became a museum ship moored next to [[Forum Marinum]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== ''La\u00ebnnec'' (1902\u20131922) ===\n\nIn 1902, the French shipping company [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Armateurs Nantais]] ordered two 3,100-ton full rigged ships from [[Chantiers de Penho\u00ebt]] in [[Saint-Nazaire]]. The first ship, launched on 7 August 1902, was christened ''La\u00ebnnec'' after [[Ren\u00e9 Laennec]], a French doctor and inventor of the [[stethoscope]]. On 18 September 1902 she was followed by the second ship, named ''[[Haudaudine]]'' after [[Pierre Haudaudine]], which was lost off the coast of [[New Caledonia]] on 3 January 1905.<ref name=\"haudaudine\">[http://www.paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TC19050105.2.12.4&e=-------10--1----2%22james+temple+fisher%22-- Shipwreck].

''La\u00ebnnec'', also seriously damaged, was towed to [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] for repairs. One of the reasons for the incident was that she was not carrying enough [[sailing ballast]] on her voyage from the shipyard, and as a result her rudder was not completely submerged in water, significantly reducing the maneuverability of the ship. Towards the end of the nine-month voyage, while carrying [[potassium nitrate]] from Chile to [[Bremerhaven]], [[Germany]], a minor [[mutiny]] broke out when four crew members disobeyed orders from Captain Turb\u00e9.<ref name=\"laennec1\" />\n\nIn 1906<ref name=\"note1\" group=\"note\">1920 according to some sources.</ref> ''La\u00ebnnec'' was sold to a French shipping company [[Compagnie Plisson]]. She made several voyages across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and around [[Kap Horn]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], and around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to [[Australia]] under the command of Captain [[Achille Guriec]]. On her way back to Europe she carried wheat or potassium nitrate.<ref name=\"laennec1\" />\n\nOn 12 December 1911, while unloading potassium nitrate at the port of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], [[Spain]], ''La\u00ebnnec'' was severely damaged when a storm pushed her against the pier and ripped the ship from her moorings, causing the full rigged ship to drift against a Dutch steam ship [[SS Rhehania|''Rhehania'']]. As there was no shipyard large enough to accommodate ''La\u00ebnnec'' in Santander, the ship was emptied and inclined until her damaged hull plating was exposed and could be repaired within the harbour. The repairs took 20 days and the ship, which by that time had become a popular attraction for the local people, left Spain on 1 February 1912.<ref name=\"laennec1\" /> In 1914 the [[main mast]] of ''La\u00ebnnec'' broke off and fell over the starboard side when the ship was struck by a heavy storm in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]]. She was towed to [[Brest, France|Brest]] for repairs.<ref name=\"laennec2\" /> On 12 June 1916 Captain Guriec died onboard ''La\u00ebnnec'' while the ship was passing the Cape of Good Hope on her way back to Europe. The command was assumed by the [[first mate]] who, according to some sources, also perished before the ship arrived in England. Later the command was given to Captain [[\u00c9mile Delano\u00eb]].<ref name=\"laennec1\" />\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] broke out, ''La\u00ebnnec'' was equipped with two deck guns. Due to the presence of German [[U-boat]]s in Europe, the ship spent the war years trading in the United States East Coast. After the war, she arrived back to her home port, Saint-Nazaire, after a 150-day voyage from Australia to be stripped and laid up. On 1 December 1920 ''La\u00ebnnec'' was put for sale.<ref name=\"laennec1\" />\n\n=== ''Oldenburg'' (1922\u20131930) ===\n[[File:Oldenburg Troense.jpg|thumb|left|''Oldenburg'', the school ship of the German merchant navy.]]\nIn late November 1922, after having been laid up for two years, ''La\u00ebnnec'' was sold to a German shipping company [[H. H. Schmidt & Co.]] from [[Hamburg]]. After refitting she was renamed ''Oldenburg'' after the city of [[Oldenburg]] and, through an agreement with the German school ship association [[Deutscher Schulschiffverein]], she became a school ship for the German merchant navy.<ref name=\"oldenburg1\">Auvinen (2002), pages 15\u201317.</ref> Among the men who received their training onboard ''Oldenburg'' over the years was the German U-boat ace [[G\u00fcnther Prien]].\n\nIn 1925, while rounding Kap Horn, ''Oldenburg'' lost her main mast in a storm and had to seek shelter due to damaged rigging. After emergency repairs in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], she crossed the Atlantic and headed back to Hamburg. However, due to strong easterly winds she was forced to pass the [[British Isles]] on the northern side instead of the [[English Channel]]. 78 days after leaving the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] estuary, ''Oldenburg'' was taken into tow by a German tugboat and towed to Hamburg.<ref name=\"oldenburg1\" />\n\nIn 1928 ''Oldenburg'' was sold to another German shipping company, [[Seefart Segelschiffs-Reederei GmbH]] from [[Bremen]]. In 1930, on her last voyage under the German flag, ''Oldenburg'' was almost lost when the cargo of [[phosphate]] shifted in heavy weather. After two weeks in a heavy storm, the longitudinal bulkhead gave way and the ship assumed a list of 55 degrees. Lifeboats, spare [[yard (sailing)|yards]] and the kitchen stove were lost overboard. However, the crew managed to righten the ship and sail her to [[Malm\u00f6]], [[Sweden]]. After unloading the ship was moved to Bremerhaven to be laid up.<ref name=\"oldenburg1\" />\n\n=== ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' (1930\u2013) ===\n\n==== Acquisition and refitting ====\n\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen in Uusikaupunki.jpg|thumb|left|''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' during outfitting in Uusikaupunki, with ''Osmo'' in the foreground]]\n\nAlthough the school ship was left out from the [[Finnish Naval Act of 1927]], the Finnish Navy decided to keep looking for a suitable vessel and purchase it separately from the major fleet renewal program. Over the years, opinions both in favor and against a school ship had been presented, but it was generally agreed that such vessel would be in many ways beneficial for the Finnish Navy. Initially there was also disagreement about the type of the ship \u2014 some were in favor of a modern steam ship that could be used in the local waters while the others preferred a traditional sailing ship that would teach the cadets traditional seaman skills and bring them closer to [[merchant mariner]]s. The latter was also recommended by foreign naval officials, and finally the Finnish Navy agreed on a sailing ship. This was further helped by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] that had brought the prices down, and the fact that windjammers had been largely replaced by steam ships.<ref name=\"aalste9\" />\n\nIn April 1930, the [[Parliament of Finland]] allotted 4,000,000 [[Finnish markka]]s for procuring a second-hand full-rigged ship and refitting it as a school ship for the Finnish Navy. During the summer of 1930, the Finnish officials inspected a number of Finnish and foreign ships that were offered for sale. These included [[Gustav Erikson]]'s four-masted [[barque]]s [[Pommern (ship)|''Pommern'']] and ''[[Herzogin Cecilie]]'', and several other ships, but all were deemed either too large or too dilapidated. In the end, the most suitable candidate came from Germany where ''Oldenburg'', a 28-year-old former school ship of the German merchant navy, was offered for sale.<ref name=\"aalste9\">Aalste et al. (1989), page 9.</ref> After inspecting the ship in Bremen, the Finnish officials purchased her in August 1930 and the German crew sailed the ship to Helsinki.<ref name=\"laennec2\" /><ref name=\"auvinen18-19\">Auvinen (2002), pages 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nAfter having been handed over to the Finnish Navy, ''Oldenburg'' was towed to [[Uusikaupunki]] for refitting. The work, which began in late 1930 and continued until November 1931, included replacing part of the bottom plating, building an additional tweendeck, refurbishing the rigging, painting the whole ship and rebuilding her cargo holds to accommodate up to 180 men. The shipyard was responsible for the structural alterations while 62 future crew members and cadets of the Finnish Navy were responsible for the other tasks, including carrying 1,200 tons of stones to the ship as sailing ballast.<ref name=\"tekn1\" />\n\nOn 1 November 1931, after a number of delays, ''Oldenburg'' was renamed ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' (Swan of Finland) after ''[[Finska Svan]]'', a Swedish 16th century warship that took part in the [[Action of 7 July 1565|naval action of 7{{nbsp}}July{{nbsp}}1565]] between Sweden and Denmark. After launching, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' broke her moorings in the strong breeze and damaged two ships, gunboat [[Finnish gunboat Karjala|''Karjala'']] and ''Osmo'', a laid-up full rigged ship built in 1869, before she was brought under control. On 4 November 1931, she left the shipyard for Helsinki, under tow and escorted by minelayer [[Finnish minelayer Louhi|''M-1'']].<ref name=\"aalste18\">Aalste et al.

Captain [[Arvo Lieto]] proposed postponing the departure until the next autumn as Christmas was drawing near and the sea was already freezing, but on 21 December 1931 [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud|President P. E. Svinhufvud]] ordered the ship to begin her first international school sailing under the Finnish flag. ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was towed to the sea on the following day, but she had to wait for favourable winds outside [[Porkkala]] until 28 December, at which point she had already been grounded once. The streak of bad luck continued when the ship was anchored in [[Trongisv\u00e1gsfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur]] in [[Su\u00f0uroy]], [[Faroe Islands]], after stopping to purchase more lubrication oil at [[Trongisv\u00e1gur]]. ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' dragged her anchors in a storm measuring 11\u201312 on the [[Beaufort scale]], drifting stern first towards the shore. After two trawlers and a tugboat managed to get the full rigged ship safely to the harbour, it was found out that the rudder had been damaged and the ship was towed to England for drydocking. After repairs, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' continued to the [[Canary Islands]], where she remained for three weeks while Captain Lieto was relieved of command and replaced by [[John Konkola]], who served as the captain of the school ship for six full and two partial voyages. From the Canary Islands, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' headed south, but the refrigeration system failed {{convert|500|km}} before the [[Equator]] and she had to turn back before a [[line-crossing ceremony]] could be held. However, the crew got some consolation when news about the end of [[prohibition in Finland]] reached the ship while she was sailing towards Finland in the Baltic Sea. ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' arrived in Finland on 22 May 1932 and was drydocked at [[Suomenlinna]] shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"first\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 27\u201333.</ref>\n\nThe second voyage of ''Suomen Joutsen'' began on 18 October 1932, and after stopping briefly in the Canady Islands and [[Cape Verde]], she crossed the Equator on 11 December for the first time flying the Finnish flag. On 24 December, the crew celebrated traditional Finnish Christmas outside [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], and arrived at the port on the following morning. The visit of \"Cisne Blanco de Finlandia\", the white swan of Finland, was widely covered in local newspapers. From Rio de Janeiro, ''Suomen Joutsen'' continued her voyage to [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and then, against her original sailing plan, to [[Buenos Aires]]. After leaving [[Argentine]] and visiting a number of ports in the Caribbean, ''Suomen Joutsen'' crossed the Atlantic and finally arrived in Finland on 3 May 1933. On the way back, her crew caught a number of [[sea turtles]] for the [[Helsinki Zoo]].<ref name=\"second\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 34\u201337</ref>\n\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen 1934.jpg|thumb|right|''Suomen Joutsen'' in a storm on her third voyage in April 1934.]]\nOn her third international sailing, ''Suomen Joutsen'' left Helsinki on 1 November 1933 and headed to the [[Mediterranean]], where she visited the ports of [[Marseille]], [[Alexandria]] and [[Naples]]. While heading towards [[Gibraltar]] on her way to the Atlantic, an English steam ship tauntingly offered to tow the Finnish full rigged ship which was sailing slowly [[points of sail|close to the wind]]. However, shortly afterwards the wind changed its direction and ''Suomen Joutsen'' overtook the steamer with a towing line hanging from the stern [[hawsehole]], offering to provide assistance for the slower ship. After stopping briefly at the Canary Islands, the ship crossed the Atlantic and arrived in Haiti on 10 March 1934 after 25 days of sailing. The return voyage began six days later. On 6 April, while in the middle of the Northern Atlantic, ''Suomen Joutsen'' was hit by hurricane-force winds that caused the ship to list almost 56 degrees. She survived the worst storm of her career without major damage and arrived in Helsinki on 16 May 1934.<ref name=\"third\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 38\u201346</ref>\n\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen 4th.jpg|thumb|left|''Suomen Joutsen'' during preparations for her fourth voyage.]]\n[[File:Suomen Joutsen seen from Rex.jpg|thumb|150px|right|''Suomen Joutsen'' photographed from the passing [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']] on 7 December 1934.]]\n''Suomen Joutsen'' began her fourth voyage on 30 October 1934 and arrived at her first stop, [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] in [[Spain]], in late November. While sailing towards the [[Greece|Greek]] port city of [[Piraeus]] outside [[Sardinia]] on 7 December, she was overtaken by the Italian 51,000-ton [[ocean liner]] [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']] which passed ''Suomen Joutsen'' at full speed of {{convert|31|kn}} from a distance of only {{convert|50|m|yd|abbr=off}}. Although the holder of the [[Blue Riband]] was a sight to behold, seeing a full rigged ship underway in the open seas was also becoming a rare treat. After visiting various ports in the Mediterranean, the ship returned to the Atlantic and stopped briefly at Ponta Delgada, but crossed neither the Atlantic nor the Equator. ''Suomen Joutsen'' returned to Helsinki on 3 May 1935.<ref name=\"fourth\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 47\u201351.</ref><ref name=\"fourth2\">Auvinen (2002), page 101.</ref>\n\nThe fifth voyage of ''Suomen Joutsen'' was the longest the ship had ever done under the Finnish flag. After leaving Helsinki on 9 October 1935, the ship stopped briefly at [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], and then continued across the Atlantic, eventually arriving in the [[Panama canal]] on 26 December. It took eleven and a half hours to transit the {{convert|81|km|mi|adj=on}} canal. After leaving Panama behind, ''Suomen Joutsen'' headed south and crossed the Equator on 4 January 1936 with appropriate ceremonies. Later the ship stopped at [[Callao]] in [[Peru]] and [[Valparaiso]] in [[Chile]], where five men escaped after a local barkeeper had offered them full upkeep for playing at his bar. The men were later caught by local officials and returned to Finland, where they were sentenced for six months in prison. After leaving Chile, ''Suomen Joutsen'' sailed around the [[Cape Horn]] without major difficulties and arrived in Buenos Aires on 21 March. From Argentine, the ship continued to Rio de Janeiro, where she encountered the Brazilian school ship ''[[Almirante Saldanha]]'', whose purchase had been inspired by the previous visit of the white swan of Finland. ''Suomen Joutsen'' sailed out on 14 April and due to heavy weather and headwinds, it took seven weeks to reach the Azores. On 9 May, Captain Konkola turned 50 and after the crew had sung \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\" at 6:30 in the morning, he stuck his head out from the cabin door and yelled \"Steward, give them [[Distilled beverage|booze]]!\" ''Suomen Joutsen'' arrived in Helsinki on 4 July 1936. After a number of disagreements regarding the use of tugboats in the foreign ports, Captain Konkola decided to sail the full rigged ship all the way to the harbour, crossing the narrow [[Kustaanmiekka|Kustaanmiekka strait]] at full sail. Finally, when the bow had already been moored at [[Katajanokka]], he allowed the tugboat to push the stern against the pier and the fifth voyage was over.<ref name=\"fifth\">Aalste et al. (1989), pp. 55\u201365.</ref>\n\nOn her sixth voyage, the most important stop of ''Suomen Joutsen'' was [[New York City]], where the ship arrived on 3 March 1937. Prior to this, the ship had visited Portugal, [[Senegal]] and a number of ports in the Caribbean after leaving Helsinki on 2 November 1936. However, the ship's first and only visit to the [[United States]] under the Finnish flag was an important milestone and a major media event. When the ship was sailing up the [[Hudson River]], an American film crew came on board to capture her arrival, and ''Suomen Joutsen'' remained the center of attention for the six days she was moored at the western end of the [[35th Street (Manhattan)|35th Street]]. When the ship left New York, a member of the crew was accidentally left on the shore. However, he managed to talk a local tugboat captain to take him back to the school ship and, for solving the problem on his own initiative, was left without punishment. After stopping at [[Oslo]], ''Suomen Joutsen'' arrived in Helsinki on the [[May Day]] of 1936. Among the first people to leave the ship was a man carrying a living [[crocodile]] under his arm, captured for the Helsinki Zoo.<ref name=\"seventh\">Aalste et al. (1989), pp. 66\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe seventh voyage of ''Suomen Joutsen'' began on 20 October 1937 and took the ship first across the Atlantic to South America. After calling Montevideo, she continued east to [[Cape Town]], stopping at [[Tristan da Cunha]] along the way. The seventh voyage has often been called the unluckiest one as three crew members were lost before the ship arrived back in Finland on 12 May 1938. On 7 February, a seaman fell from the bow mast and was buried at sea on the following day. On the way to Cape Town, a sergeant became ill and later died in a hospital in [[South Africa]] on 10 March. On 10 May, a member of the regular crew fell to the sea while painting the hull when the ship was underway in the Baltic Sea. Many thought that the deaths were due to the crew killing three [[albatross]]es earlier in the voyage. Finally, when ''Suomen Joutsen'' was outside Helsinki, a small airplane flew too close to the ship and crashed into the sea, but the pilots were rescued.<ref name=\"seventh2\">Aalste et al. (1989), pages 77\u201383</ref><ref>Auvinen (2002), pp. 221\u2013223.</ref>\n\n''Suomen Joutsen'' left for her eighth and last international voyage on 27 October 1938. After stopping at Copenhagen for provisions and clearing the English Channel \u2014 and almost colliding with the Polish passenger ship [[MS Pi\u0142sudski|''Pi\u0142sudski'']] \u2014 she continued to the [[Bay of Biscay]]. However, {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=on}} waves forced ''Suomen Joutsen'' to turn back on 23 November and head to [[Bordeaux]] to wait for the weather to clear. Captain Konkola, concerned about his ailing health, was relieved of his duty and replaced by [[Unto Voionmaa]] on 3 December 1938. Under his command, ''Suomen Joutsen'' crossed the Atlantic twice, calling the ports of [[Pernambuco]] in Brazil and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] in [[Puerto Rico]]. On her last stop at [[Rotterdam]], there were already signs of a [[World War II|major conflict]] in the air, and had the war started before the ship arrived in Finland, she would have headed to the United Kingdom. ''Suomen Joutsen'' arrived in Helsinki on 22 April 1939, after which she never left the Baltic Sea again.<ref name=\"eight\">Aalste et al.

She was used as a [[submarine tender|supply ship]] for the Finnish submarine fleet within the Finnish archipelago. When the [[Winter War]] broke out on 30 November 1939, she was stationed in [[H\u00f6gs\u00e5ra]] with the submarines and [[coastal defence ship]]s [[Finnish coastal defence ship V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen|''V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'']] and [[Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen|''Ilmarinen'']]. After three [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scout planes flew over the ships, the fleet moved hastily to another safe location near [[Nagu]] only hours before eight four-engined enemy bombers overflew the previous anchorage. During the first weeks of the war, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was assigned to \"moving supply depot\" under the [[Archipelago Sea Fleet]] that consisted of the full rigged ship and a number of barges and tugboats. She served in this task until the Winter War ended with the signing of the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] on 13 March 1940. During the [[Interim Peace]] she was stationed in [[Naantali]].<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\">Auvinen (2002), pp. 273\u2013276.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] started on 25 June 1941, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' resumed her old tasks as a moving supply depot under the Archipelago Sea Fleet. Since the Finnish Navy now had a dedicated submarine tender, [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|icebreaker ''Sisu'']], the former school ship was relegated to supply [[motor torpedo boat]]s. After the war ended on 19 September 1944, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was used as an accommodation ship in Turku.<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" />\n\nDuring the war, around 150 men were stationed on ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen''. The ship was lightly armed with only two machine guns and around 40 rifles.<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" /> She survived the war largely intact, with only minor [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] damage from Soviet air raids.<ref>Aalste et al.

She served in this task until the mine clearance was finished in 1948, but was afterwards used as an accommodation and supply ship for different branches of the Finnish Navy. In 1955\u20131959 she was stationed in [[Upinniemi]].<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" />\n\nWhile ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' served as a supply ship for the minesweeping fleet, her crew rebuilt the rigging dismantled before the war and the school ship spent a couple of days sailing in the Baltic Sea in late 1948. Although there were plans to reactivate her as a school ship for either the Finnish Navy or the Finnish Merchant Fleet, or both, there were issues with her [[naval ensign]] \u2014 as a naval school ship she would not be allowed to carry cargo or be crewed by civilians, but a civilian flag would force her to pay expensive harbour fees. There was also no longer need for a civilian full rigged school ship. In 1949\u20131951, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' conducted a number of short training and promotional sailings in the Baltic Sea, but never ventured further than the southern tip of [[Gotland]].<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" /><ref name=\"aalste93-94\">Aalste et al.

Paasikivi]] was against the voyage \u2014 sailing a full rigged ship so soon after the war while the [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union]] were still being paid was deemed too flamboyant. It was Paasikivi who, as the director of the Finnish Export Society in the 1930s, had been one of the major supporters of ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen''. The danger of stray naval mines had also not completely disappeared.<ref name=\"auvinen273-276\" /><ref name=\"aalste93-94\" /> In 1961, the Finnish Navy purchased [[HMS Porlock Bay (K650)|HMS ''Porlock Bay'']], a [[Bay class frigate|''Bay'' class frigate]], as the new school ship.<ref name=\"auvinen277-278\">Auvinen (2002), pp. 277\u2013278.</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==== Seamen's school (1961\u20131991) ====\n\nIn the late 1940s, the [[Finnish Seamen's Union]] proposed the Finnish government that ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' should be turned into a stationary seamen's school. As nothing happened, the Union renewed its proposal with a different tone in the late 1950s when it learned that the government was planning to sell the old full rigged ship for German scrap dealers and, in fact, the first payment had already been made. The Union gave its ultimatum on 29 April 1959 and when the government did not react, the crews of the inspection ships under the Finnish Maritime Administration went on a strike on 2 May. Before the action could spread, the government acceded and it was agreed that ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' would be stationed in Turku. However, due to intentional delays nothing happened until [[Niilo W\u00e4ll\u00e4ri]], the leader of the Finnish Seamen's Union, presented his final ultimatum on 13 January 1960: if the preparations to turn ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' into a seamen's school did not begin immediately, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers would go into strike on 15 January, effectively stopping all foreign trade. Two days later, [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|icebreaker ''Sampo'']] began towing the former school ship through the icefields towards Turku, where the convoy arrived on 17 January 1960.<ref name=\"aalste95-96\">Aalste et al.

Two new classrooms were also built on the deck, slightly altering the appearance of the vessel. The first classes were held on 1 March 1961, and on 4 May the school was officially opened. On the same day, the naval ensign was replaced with the civilian flag.<ref>Aalste et al.

In the 1980s, the facilities on board the school ship were becoming too small and increasingly obsolete, and there were talks about closing the school by the end of the decade. There was also discussion about turning ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' to a museum ship.

Both main mast and bow mast have six [[Yard (sailing)|yards]], the longest ones being {{convert|27|m|ftin}} long and weighing four tons, while the mizzenmast has five yards. The height of her main mast, which consists of three parts, is {{convert|52|m|ftin}} from the waterline. The sail area of ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' is {{convert|2200|m2|sqft}}<ref name=\"note3\" group=\"note\">{{convert|2807|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} according to original drawings (Auvinen (2002)), but otherwise always reported as {{convert|2200|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} in sources.</ref> and three sets of sails, each weighing three tons, were carried on training voyages. Her [[standing rigging|standing]] and [[running rigging]] consist of over {{convert|30|km}} of manilla ropes and steel cables. The typical sailing speed of ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was around {{convert|12|kn}}, but once in the [[North Sea]] she reached a record speed of {{convert|16.4|kn}} with only [[topsail]]s and the [[foresail]].<ref name=\"laennec1\" /><ref name=\"tekn1\" />\n\nThe [[length overall|overall length]] of ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' is {{convert|96|m|ftin}}. Her hull is {{convert|80|m|ftin}} long [[waterline length|at the waterline]], has a beam of {{convert|12.3|m|ftin}} at midship and depth of {{convert|7.29|m|ftin}} to main deck. When she was carrying cargo, her tonnage was 2,393 [[register ton]]s [[gross register tonnage|gross]], 1,734 register tons [[net register tonnage|net]] and 3,100 tons [[deadweight tonnage|deadweight]].<ref name=\"tonnage\" group=\"note\" /> The ship drew {{convert|6.35|m|ftin}} of water when loaded, but as a school ship she sailed with a ballast draft of only {{convert|5.15|m|ftin}}. With 1,200 tons of stones as [[sailing ballast]], her displacement was 2,900 tons and [[metacentric height]] {{convert|0.699|m|ftin}}. Later some of the stone ballast was replaced with concrete and iron.<ref>Juutilainen (1942).</ref> Internally her hull was divided into five watertight compartments.<ref name=\"laennec1\" /><ref name=\"tekn1\" />\n\nWhen ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was converted to a school ship for the Finnish Navy, her general arrangements were changed considerably in order to accommodate up to 180 men on long international voyages. In addition to living quarters, bathrooms and toilets, this included building kitchens and six refrigerated rooms for provisions, workshops for a carpenter, shoemaker and tailor, laundry room, hospital with ten beds and a small isolation ward, classroom, library, canteen, and more storage space for sails, ropes, paint, sand and coal. Nine freshwater tanks with a total capacity of 206 tons were also built, but in order to conserve water a traditional Finnish [[sauna]] was not provided. Instead, hot steam could be diverted into the washing rooms under the forecastle.<ref name=\"tekn1\" />\n\nOriginally built without auxiliary propulsion, ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' was refitted with two [[Skandia (engine)|Skandia]] [[hot bulb engine]]s, each producing 200&nbsp;hp, coupled to three-bladed fixed pitch propellers. The twin-shaft propulsion arrangement was very uncommon at that time. In practice the engines were found out to be underpowered, but they could still be used to assist manoeuvering in ports and in heavy weather. Two generators (5&nbsp;kW and 8&nbsp;kW) were added to produce electricity for about three hundred lights. While ''Suomen{{nbsp}}Joutsen'' had a steam boiler for central heating, she did not have steam winches \u2014 anchors and yards were lifted using a [[Capstan (nautical)|manual capstan]].<ref name=\"tekn1\" />\n{{-}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Commons category|Suomen Joutsen (ship, 1902)}}\n*{{cite book |last= Auvinen |first= Visa |title= Leijonalippu merell\u00e4 |publisher=Satakunnan Kirjateollisuus Oy| location = Pori |year= 1983 |isbn= 951-95781-1-0 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Auvinen|first=Visa|title=Suomen Joutsen \u2014 Onnekas satavuotias|publisher=TS-Yhtym\u00e4 Oy|year=2002|isbn=951-9129-48-0}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Aalste|first1=Juhani|last2=Aittola|first2=Heikki|last3=Mauno|first3=Jukka|title=Suomen Joutsen|publisher=Merikustannus Oy|year=1989|isbn=951-95457-2-7}}\n*{{cite book |last=Juutilainen |first=Martti |title=Sellainen oli retkemme - Suomen Joutsenen matkat maailman merill\u00e4|publisher=Fennia|year=1942}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.forum-marinum.fi/nayttelyt-ja-museoalukset/museolaivat/fregatti-suomen-joutsen Suomen Joutsen at Forum Marinum]\n\n{{Oldest surviving ships (pre-1919)}}\n\n{{coord|60|26|10|N|22|14|13|E|display=title|region:FI_type:landmark_source:dewiki}}\n[[Category:Full-rigged ships]]\n[[Category:Training ships]]\n[[Category:Ships of the Finnish Navy]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Finland]]\n[[Category:Tall ships of France]]\n[[Category:Tall ships of Germany]]\n[[Category:Tall ships of Finland]]\n[[Category:1902 ships]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Turku]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Turku]]\n", "name_user": "Tupsumato", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suomen_Joutsen"}
