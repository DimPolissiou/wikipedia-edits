The [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]] and other government agencies administer the national highways. Beginning in 1952, Japan classified these as Class 1 or Class 2. Class 1 highways had one- or two-digit numbers, while Class 2 highways had three-digit numbers. For example, Routes [[Route 1 (Japan)|1]] and [[Route 58 (Japan)|58]] were Class 1 highways while [[Route 507 (Japan)|507]] (the one with the highest number) was a Class 2 highway.\n\nA 1964 amendment to the governing law resulted in a unification of the classes, which took effect in April of the following year. Highways numbered since that time have had three-digit numbers, so the numbers 58\u2013100, which had so far been unused, remained unused. However, when [[Okinawa Prefecture]] reverted to Japanese control in 1972, Route 58, with its southern endpoint in Okinawa's capital city of [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]], was established. The numbers from 59 to 100 remain unused. Some other numbers have been vacated by the joining or changing of routes: 109 (joined with 108), 110 (renumbered as 48), 111 (renumbered as 45), 214\u2013216 (joined to form 57).\n\n==List of

The [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]] and other government agencies administer the national highways. Beginning in 1952, Japan classified these as Class 1 or Class 2. Class 1 highways had one- or two-digit numbers, while Class 2 highways had three-digit numbers. For example, Routes [[Route 1 (Japan)|1]] and [[Route 58 (Japan)|58]] were Class 1 highways while [[Route 507 (Japan)|507]] (the one with the highest number) was a Class 2 highway.\n\nA 1964 amendment to the governing law resulted in a unification of the classes, which took effect in April of the following year. Highways numbered since that time have had three-digit numbers, so the numbers 58\u2013100, which had so far been unused, remained unused. However, when [[Okinawa Prefecture]] reverted to Japanese control in 1972, Route 58, with its southern endpoint in Okinawa's capital city of [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]], was established. The numbers from 59 to 100 remain unused. Some other numbers have been vacated by the joining or changing of routes: 109 (joined with 108), 110 (renumbered as 48), 111 (renumbered as 45), 214\u2013216 (joined to form 57).\n\n==List of

While commonly inhabiting lowlands, it has been reported at elevations as high as {{convert|3200|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Occasionally it also occurs in dense tropical areas.

Here, the species is assumed to have been [[introduced species|introduced]], but it is not known when the introduction occurred. Their presence in Florida is attributed to a writer from [[Chiefland, Florida|Chiefland]] who at some point imported the animals from their native habitat and released them near his hometown and in other locations across the state.\n\nNo live or dead specimens are known, but many sightings considered credible by biologists have been reported. The earliest of these occurred in 1907, and was followed by various additional sightings throughout the Florida Peninsula from the 1930s through the 1950s. The first official report was released in 1942. Significantly fewer reliable sightings were reported after that, and in 1977 [[W. T. Neill]] concluded the population had declined. However, sightings have continued.<ref name=Simberloff/>\n\nJaguarundis have also been reported in the coastal area of [[Alabama]] since the 1980s, which may be evidence of the Florida population migrating northward.<ref name=Simberloff>{{cite book |title= Strangers in Paradise: Impact and Management of Nonindigenous Species in Florida |last1=Simberloff |first1=D. |authorlink=Daniel Simberloff |author2=Schmitz, D.C. |author3=Brown, T.C. |year=1997|publisher= Island Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-1-55963-430-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtrpSllq4SQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Behavior and ecology==\nThe jaguarundi is shy and reclusive, and evidently very cautious of [[Animal trapping|traps]].<ref name=Simberloff/> It is generally encountered alone in the wild, suggesting a solitary lifestyle. In captivity, however, it tolerate the close presence of mates. It makes an unusually wide range of vocalisations, including purrs, whistles, yaps, chattering sounds, and even a bird-like chirp. It [[scent mark]]s its territory by scratching the ground or nearby branches, rubbing its head, urination, and leaving faeces uncovered.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Diet===\nThe jaguarundi is primarily [[Diurnality|diurnal]], being active during the day rather than evenings or night. It is comfortable in trees, but prefers to hunt on the ground. It eats almost any small animal it can catch, typically a mixture of [[rodent]]s, small [[reptile]]s, and ground-feeding [[bird]]s. Jaguarundis have been observed to also kill larger prey, such as [[rabbit]]s, and [[opossum]]s; unusual prey include [[fish]] and even [[marmoset]]s. It also consumes a small amount of vegetation and [[arthropod]]s.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe timing of the breeding season among jaguarundis is unclear; they breed all year round. [[Oestrus]] lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. After a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are born with spots on their undersides, which disappear as they age. The young are capable of taking solid food at around six weeks, although they begin to play with their mother's food as early as three weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at about two years of age, and have lived for up to 10 years in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Puma yagouaroundi.jpg|thumb|Captive jaguarundi]]\nThe jaguarundi has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2002.

While commonly inhabiting lowlands, it has been reported at elevations as high as {{convert|3200|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Occasionally it also occurs in dense tropical areas. Their home range is widely variable, depending on the local environment; individuals have been reported as ranging over territories from {{convert|6.8|to|100|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Introduced range===\nJaguarundis have been sighted in [[Florida]] since the early 20th century. Here, the species is assumed to have been [[introduced species|introduced]], but it is not known when the introduction occurred. Their presence in Florida is attributed to a writer from [[Chiefland, Florida|Chiefland]] who at some point imported the animals from their native habitat and released them near his hometown and in other locations across the state.\n\nNo live or dead specimens are known, but many sightings considered credible by biologists have been reported. The earliest of these occurred in 1907, and was followed by various additional sightings throughout the Florida Peninsula from the 1930s through the 1950s. The first official report was released in 1942. Significantly fewer reliable sightings were reported after that, and in 1977 [[W. T. Neill]] concluded the population had declined. However, sightings have continued.<ref name=Simberloff/>\n\nJaguarundis have also been reported in the coastal area of [[Alabama]] since the 1980s, which may be evidence of the Florida population migrating northward.<ref name=Simberloff>{{cite book |title= Strangers in Paradise: Impact and Management of Nonindigenous Species in Florida |last1=Simberloff |first1=D. |authorlink=Daniel Simberloff |author2=Schmitz, D.C. |author3=Brown, T.C. |year=1997|publisher= Island Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-1-55963-430-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtrpSllq4SQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Behavior and ecology==\nThe jaguarundi is shy and reclusive, and evidently very cautious of [[Animal trapping|traps]].<ref name=Simberloff/> It is generally encountered alone in the wild, suggesting a solitary lifestyle. In captivity, however, it tolerate the close presence of mates. It makes an unusually wide range of vocalisations, including purrs, whistles, yaps, chattering sounds, and even a bird-like chirp. It [[scent mark]]s its territory by scratching the ground or nearby branches, rubbing its head, urination, and leaving faeces uncovered.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Diet===\nThe jaguarundi is primarily [[Diurnality|diurnal]], being active during the day rather than evenings or night. It is comfortable in trees, but prefers to hunt on the ground. It eats almost any small animal it can catch, typically a mixture of [[rodent]]s, small [[reptile]]s, and ground-feeding [[bird]]s. Jaguarundis have been observed to also kill larger prey, such as [[rabbit]]s, and [[opossum]]s; unusual prey include [[fish]] and even [[marmoset]]s. It also consumes a small amount of vegetation and [[arthropod]]s.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe timing of the breeding season among jaguarundis is unclear; they breed all year round. [[Oestrus]] lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. After a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are born with spots on their undersides, which disappear as they age. The young are capable of taking solid food at around six weeks, although they begin to play with their mother's food as early as three weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at about two years of age, and have lived for up to 10 years in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Puma yagouaroundi.jpg|thumb|Captive jaguarundi]]\nThe jaguarundi has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2002. The megareserves of the [[Amazon Basin]] are probably the only conservation units that can sustain long-term viable populations.<ref name=iucn/>\nIt is not particularly sought after for its [[fur]], but is suffering decline due to loss of habitat. The [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] has expressed concern that its presence in South Texas may be imperiled due to loss of the cat's native habitat.<ref name=Texas2003>{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/land/habitats/southtx_plain/endangered_species/ |title=Endangered Species |website=Tpwd.state.tx.us |date=2003-04-15 |access-date=2011-09-15 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe North and Central American populations of the jaguarundi are listed in [[CITES Appendix I]].
