{"title_page": "Melita issue", "text_new": "[[File:Malta 1922 One Pound.jpg|thumb|The \u00a31 black and carmine, the highest denomination of the Melita issue]]\n\nThe '''Melita issue''' is a series of dual-purpose [[Postage stamp|postage]]-and-[[Revenue stamp|revenue stamps]] issued by the [[Crown Colony of Malta]] between 1922 and 1926, depicting the national personification [[Melita (personification)|Melita]]. They were [[commemorative stamp]]s since they celebrated the islands' new status as a [[self-governing colony]] following a new constitution in 1921, but also a [[Definitive stamp|definitive issue]] intended for regular use over an extended period of time.\n\nDesigned by two leading Maltese artists, [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and [[Gianni Vella]], the issue consisted of stamps in various denominations from \u00bc[[pence|d]] to [[\u00a3sd|\u00a3]]1; Caruana Dingli's designs were used on the pence and pound values and Vella's design on the shilling values. The designs were poorly received when they were issued, and Caruana Dingli himself criticized the execution of the design. In subsequent years, however, Caruana Dingli's design came to be regarded as one of the most iconic Malta stamps, and his design for the figure of Melita formed the basis of the [[Maltese lira]] banknotes of 1989\u20132008 and gold [[bullion coin]]s minted since 2018.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:1902 2s6d Olive-Green revenue stamp of Malta.jpg|thumb|left|The 1899 Melita design (the stamp shown here was overprinted for revenue purposes in 1902)]]\n\nThe oldest known depiction of a personification of Malta dates back to 1481. The figure of [[Melita (personification)|Melita]] seems to have developed from allegorical representations of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St John]], which [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|ruled Malta]] between 1530 and 1798.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kinnane-Roelofsma |first1=Derk |title=Britannia and Melita: Pseudomorphic Sisters |journal=Journal of the Warbourg and Courtauld Insitute |date=1996 |volume=59 |pages=130\u2013147}}</ref>\n\nAn allegorical figure of Malta first appeared stamps in 1899. A 2[[shilling|s]]/6d olive-grey stamp depicted Melita holding a sword and a shield, the latter emblazoned with the [[Maltese cross]].

This divided control of Malta between two governments: the Maltese Government and the Maltese Imperial Government. The former included a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] with a [[Senate of Malta|Senate]] and [[Parliament of Malta|Legislative Assembly]], while the Imperial Government was led by the [[List of Governors of Malta|Governor of Malta]], a British colonial official who retained direct responsibility of certain reserved matters such as defence and maintaining public order.<ref name=\"bephila\">{{cite web|title=Melita Issue of Malta Stamps: 1922\u201326|url=http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|website=British Empire Philately|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113650/http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|archivedate=16 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cassar |first1=Carmel |title=A Concise History of Malta |date=2000 |publisher=Mireva Publications |location=[[Msida]] |isbn=1870579526 |page=204}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1921, a [[design competition|competition]] was announced calling for the design of a set of stamps to commemorate Malta's partial independence. The stamps were therefore to be [[commemorative stamp|commemoratives]], but they were also intended as [[Definitive stamp|definitives]] for regular use over an extended period of time.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe Maltese wanted to issue the new stamps by the time the new parliament was inaugurated on 1 November 1921. There was not enough time for the stamps to be produced and delivered within that timeframe, however, since the printers [[De La Rue]] had to deal with a large workload, causing delays. The Malta Post Office therefore decided to overprint the then-current definitives (which depicted King [[George V]] and some pictorial scenes, including the 1919 reprint of the 1899 Melita design) with the words \"SELF-GOVERNMENT\" diagonally to commemorate the new constitution.<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The overprinting was carried out by the Government Printing Office in the capital [[Valletta]], and the stamps were released between 12 January and 29 April 1922.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\n==Design==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Malta -mix- 2019 by-RaBoe 260.jpg\n | alt1 = A lighthouse\n | image2 = Gozo boat cropped.jpg\n | alt2 = Painting of a boat\n | footer = The St Elmo lighthouse and a [[Gozo boat]] (painting pictured) are depicted in the background of Caruana Dingli's design\n}}\n\nTwo designs were chosen from the competition: one by [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and one by [[Gianni Vella]]. Caruana Dingli's design was used for ten denominations, including the [[Penny|pence]] values ranging from \u00bcd to 6d, and also the highest value of the set, the [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1. Vella's design was used for five denominations: the [[shilling]] values ranging from 1/- to 10/-.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nCaruana Dingli's design depicts [[Melita (personification)|Melita]] as a robed and helmeted figure holding a [[rudder]], representing Malta as being in control of her own destiny.<ref name=\"cbm-bullion\"/> The background contains a seascape, with the lighthouse near [[Fort Saint Elmo]] and a [[Gozo boat]] visible. Shields depicting the [[Union Jack]] and a colonial badge representing Malta are located at the bottom of the design.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nVella's design contains two figures representing Malta and the United Kingdom, Melita and [[Brittania]]. Melita holds an olive branch in her hand, and embraces Brittania by awkwardly lifting her hand around Brittania's neck. Brittania wears a helmet and holds a shield with the Union Jack. The figure representing the United Kingdom is sometimes interpreted as being a male figure,<ref name=\"bephila\"/><ref name=\"times20111204\">{{cite news |last1=Bonavia |first1=Carmel |title=Stamps marking Malta's constitutional development |url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111204/life-features/Stamps-marking-Malta-s-constitutional-development.397019 |work=[[Times of Malta]] |date=4 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911114312/https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111204/life-features/Stamps-marking-Malta-s-constitutional-development.397019 |archivedate=11 September 2018}}</ref> but was intended as female, with the design representing Malta and Britain as sisters or mother and daughter.<ref name=\"linns\"/><ref name=\"bop1922\"/> This represented the care and protection that Britain offered Malta, and symbolized friendly relations between them.

The typographed stamps were printed on chalk-surfaced paper. Each stamp was printed in two operations, with a [[Key type stamp|key plate and a duty plate]]. In most cases each plate was printed in a different colour, but for some of the low values both plates were printed in the same colour.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe [[watermark]] used on the stamps is known as ''Multiple Script CA'', since it consists of the letters \"CA\" (referring to the [[Crown Agents]]) in a script typeface, beneath a representation of the [[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor crown]], arranged multiple times next to each other. The watermark was sideways for the pence values and upright for the shilling values. The \u00a31 was initially printed with an upright watermark but in 1925 it was also issued with a sideways watermark.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe pence values were printed in sheets of 160 stamps (consisting of two panes, each containing 8 rows of 10 stamps), the shilling values were printed in sheets of 80 (one pane of 8 rows of 10 stamps) and the \u00a31 was printed in sheets of 40 (one pane of 4 rows of 10 stamps).<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe stamps were perforated with [[Perforation gauge|gauge]] 14.2 by 14 comb perforations.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nA number of [[Die proof (philately)|die proofs]] and plate proofs of stamps from the Melita issue exist. Die proofs are individual prints from the stamps' original [[Die (philately)|die]]s made at various stages of production, and are impressions of either the key die or the duty die of each value, or composite die proofs of both dies together.

They were [[commemorative stamp]]s since they celebrated the islands' new status as a [[self-governing colony]] following a new constitution in 1921, but also a [[Definitive stamp|definitive issue]] intended for regular use over an extended period of time.\n\nDesigned by two leading Maltese artists, [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and [[Gianni Vella]], the issue consisted of stamps in various denominations from \u00bc[[pence|d]] to [[\u00a3sd|\u00a3]]1; Caruana Dingli's designs were used on the pence and pound values and Vella's design on the shilling values. The designs were poorly received when they were issued, and Caruana Dingli himself criticized the execution of the design. In subsequent years, however, Caruana Dingli's design came to be regarded as one of the most iconic Malta stamps, and his design for the figure of Melita formed the basis of the [[Maltese lira]] banknotes of 1989\u20132008 and gold [[bullion coin]]s minted since 2018.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:1902 2s6d Olive-Green revenue stamp of Malta.jpg|thumb|left|The 1899 Melita design (the stamp shown here was overprinted for revenue purposes in 1902)]]\n\nThe oldest known depiction of a personification of Malta dates back to 1481.

There was not enough time for the stamps to be produced and delivered within that timeframe, however, since the printers [[De La Rue]] had to deal with a large workload, causing delays. The Malta Post Office therefore decided to overprint the then-current definitives (which depicted King [[George V]] and some pictorial scenes, including the 1919 reprint of the 1899 Melita design) with the words \"SELF-GOVERNMENT\" diagonally to commemorate the new constitution.<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The overprinting was carried out by the Government Printing Office in the capital [[Valletta]], and the stamps were released between 12 January and 29 April 1922.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\n==Design==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Malta -mix- 2019 by-RaBoe 260.jpg\n | alt1 = A lighthouse\n | image2 = Gozo boat cropped.jpg\n | alt2 = Painting of a boat\n | footer = The St Elmo lighthouse and a [[Gozo boat]] (painting pictured) are depicted in the background of Caruana Dingli's design\n}}\n\nTwo designs were chosen from the competition: one by [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and one by [[Gianni Vella]]. Caruana Dingli's design was used for ten denominations, including the [[Penny|pence]] values ranging from \u00bcd to 6d, and also the highest value of the set, the [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1. Vella's design was used for five denominations: the [[shilling]] values ranging from 1/- to 10/-.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nCaruana Dingli's design depicts [[Melita (personification)|Melita]] as a robed and helmeted figure holding a [[rudder]], representing Malta as being in control of her own destiny.<ref name=\"cbm-bullion\"/> The background contains a seascape, with the lighthouse near [[Fort Saint Elmo]] and a [[Gozo boat]] visible.
