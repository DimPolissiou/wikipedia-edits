Jacques Schiffrin and his family had to flee and eventually found refuge in the United States. As the younger Schiffrin recalls in his autobiography, ''A Political Education: Coming of Age in Paris and New York'' (2007), he thus experienced life in two countries as a child of a European Jewish intellectual family.\n\nAs an anti-Communist socialist, Schiffrin opposed both the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the U.S. war in Vietnam. He was one of the founders of the organization that became [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/04/13/the-bush-six|title=The Bush Six|first=Jane|last=Mayer|website=The New Yorker}}</ref> In 1968, he signed the \"[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''</ref>\n\nSchiffrin was the managing director of publishing at [[Pantheon Books]], where he was partially responsible for introducing the works of [[Boris Pasternak|Pasternak]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and others to [[United States|American]] readers. Schiffrin's 28-year period at Pantheon, a division of Random House, came to an end in 1990 when CEO Alberto Vitale sacked him because of a conflict over the division's losses and the downsizing which Vitale wished to make.<ref name=\"McFadden\"/>\n\nIn 1992 Schiffrin, with former Pantheon colleague Diane Wachtell, established the non-profit [[The New Press]],<ref name=\"McFadden\"/> explaining that he did so because of economic trends that prevented him from publishing the serious books he thought should be made available. Schiffrin discussed what he regards as the crisis in western publishing in his book ''The Business of Books: How the International Conglomerates Took Over Publishing and Changed the Way We Read'' (2000).\n\nIn 2011, Schiffrin was made a [[Legion of Honour|Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] by the French government.<ref name=clh>{{cite web|last=Delattre|first=Fran\u00e7ois|title=Andr\u00e9 SCHIFFRIN Awarded Chevalier in the Order of the Legion of Honor|url=http://www.ambafrance-us.org/spip.php?article2914|publisher=French Embassy in the United States|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nSchiffrin's daughter, journalist [[Anya Schiffrin]], is married to the economist and Nobel Prize winner [[Joseph Stiglitz]].

Jacques Schiffrin and his family had to flee and eventually found refuge in the United States. As the younger Schiffrin recalls in his autobiography, ''A Political Education: Coming of Age in Paris and New York'' (2007), he thus experienced life in two countries as a child of a European Jewish intellectual family.\n\nAs an anti-Communist socialist, Schiffrin opposed both the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the U.S. war in Vietnam. He was one of the founders of the organization that became [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]].<ref>https://www.newyorker.com/talk/2009/04/13/090413ta_talk_mayer</ref> In 1968, he signed the \"[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''</ref>\n\nSchiffrin was the managing director of publishing at [[Pantheon Books]], where he was partially responsible for introducing the works of [[Boris Pasternak|Pasternak]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and others to [[United States|American]] readers. Schiffrin's 28-year period at Pantheon, a division of Random House, came to an end in 1990 when CEO Alberto Vitale sacked him because of a conflict over the division's losses and the downsizing which Vitale wished to make.<ref name=\"McFadden\"/>\n\nIn 1992 Schiffrin, with former Pantheon colleague Diane Wachtell, established the non-profit [[The New Press]],<ref name=\"McFadden\"/> explaining that he did so because of economic trends that prevented him from publishing the serious books he thought should be made available. Schiffrin discussed what he regards as the crisis in western publishing in his book ''The Business of Books: How the International Conglomerates Took Over Publishing and Changed the Way We Read'' (2000).\n\nIn 2011, Schiffrin was made a [[Legion of Honour|Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] by the French government.<ref name=clh>{{cite web|last=Delattre|first=Fran\u00e7ois|title=Andr\u00e9 SCHIFFRIN Awarded Chevalier in the Order of the Legion of Honor|url=http://www.ambafrance-us.org/spip.php?article2914|publisher=French Embassy in the United States|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nSchiffrin's daughter, journalist [[Anya Schiffrin]], is married to the economist and Nobel Prize winner [[Joseph Stiglitz]].

It was the precursor of the [[Nazi Party]], which was officially known as the National Socialist German Workers' Party ({{lang-de|Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei}}, NSDAP). The DAP only lasted from 5 January 1919 until 24 February 1920.\n\n== Origins ==\nOn 5 January 1919, the German Workers' Party (DAP) was founded in [[Munich]] in the hotel F\u00fcrstenfelder Hof by [[Anton Drexler]],{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} along with [[Dietrich Eckart]], [[Gottfried Feder]] and [[Karl Harrer]]. It developed out of the ''Freier Arbeiterausschuss f\u00fcr einen guten Frieden'' (Free Workers' Committee for a Good Peace) league, a branch of which Drexler had founded in 1918.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} Thereafter in 1918, Harrer (a journalist and member of the [[Thule Society]]), convinced Drexler and several others to form the ''[[Politischer Arbeiterzirkel]]'' (Political Workers' Circle).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} The members met periodically for discussions with themes of [[nationalism]] and [[antisemitism]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} Drexler was encouraged to form the DAP in December 1918 by his mentor, Dr. Paul Tafel. Tafel was a leader of the [[Alldeutscher Verband]] ([[Pan-Germanism|Pan-Germanist]] Union), a director of the [[MAN SE|Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N\u00fcrnberg]] and a member of the Thule Society. Drexler's wish was for a political party which was both in touch with the masses and [[nationalist]]. With the DAP founding in January 1919, Drexler was elected chairman and Harrer was made Reich Chairman, an honorary title.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=82, 83}} On 17 May, only ten members were present at the meeting, and a later meeting in August only noted 38 members attending.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=83}}\n\n=== Adolf Hitler's membership ===\n[[File:Hitler's DAP membership card.png|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]]'s DAP card with the membership number 7 (altered from the original)]]\nAfter [[World War I]] ended, [[Adolf Hitler]] returned to Munich. Having no formal education or career prospects, he tried to remain in the army for as long as possible.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=109}} In July 1919, he was appointed ''Verbindungsmann'' (intelligence agent) of an ''Aufkl\u00e4rungskommando'' (reconnaissance commando) of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' to influence other soldiers and to investigate the DAP. While monitoring the activities of the DAP, Hitler became attracted to founder Anton Drexler's anti-Semitic, nationalist, [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]], and [[anti-Marxist]] ideas.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} While attending a party meeting at the ''[[Sterneckerbr\u00e4u]]'' beer hall on 12 September 1919, Hitler became involved in a heated political argument with a visitor, Professor Baumann, who questioned the soundness of Gottfried Feder's arguments against capitalism and proposed that [[Bavaria]] should break away from [[Prussia]] and become part of a new South German nation with [[Austria]]. In vehemently attacking the man's arguments, he made an impression on the other party members with his oratory skills and, according to Hitler, Baumann left the hall acknowledging unequivocal defeat.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=75}} Impressed with Hitler's oratory skills, Drexler encouraged him to join. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=170}} Although Hitler initially wanted to form his own party, he claimed to have been convinced to join the DAP because it was small and he could eventually become its leader.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=126}}\n\nIn less than a week, Hitler received a postcard stating he had officially been accepted as a member and he should come to a committee meeting to discuss it. Hitler attended the committee meeting held at the run-down Altes Rosenbad beer-house.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=75, 76}} Normally, enlisted army personnel were not allowed to join political parties. In this case, Hitler had Captain [[Karl Mayr]]'s permission to join the DAP. Further, Hitler was allowed to stay in the army and receive his weekly pay of 20 gold marks a week.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=76}} At the time when Hitler joined the party, there were no membership numbers or cards. It was in January 1920 when a numeration was issued for the first time and listed in alphabetical order Hitler received the number 555. In reality, he had been the 55th member, but the counting started at the number 501 in order to make the party appear larger.{{sfn|Mitcham|1996|p=67}} In his work ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler later claimed to be the seventh party member, and he was in fact the seventh executive member of the party's central committee.<ref>Werner Maser, Der Sturm auf die Republik \u2013 Fr\u00fchgeschichte der NSDAP, ECON Verlag, D\u00fcsseldorf, Vienna, New York, Moscow, Special Edition 1994, {{ISBN|3-430-16373-0}}.</ref> After giving his first speech for the DAP on 16 October at the ''[[Hofbr\u00e4ukeller]]'', Hitler quickly became the party's most active orator. Hitler's considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership as crowds began to flock to hear his speeches during 1919\u20131920. With the support of Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920. Hitler preferred that role as he saw himself as the drummer for a national cause. He saw propaganda as the way to bring nationalism to the public.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=81, 84, 85, 89, 96}}\n\n=== From DAP to NSDAP ===\nThe small number of party members were quickly won over to [[Political views of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's political beliefs]]. He organized their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people for 24 February 1920 in the ''[[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus am Platzl|Staatliches Hofbr\u00e4uhaus in M\u00fcnchen]]''. Further in an attempt to make the party more broadly appealing to larger segments of the population, the DAP was renamed the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP) on 24 February.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=87}}{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1997|p=629}} Such was the significance of Hitler's particular move in publicity that Harrer resigned from the party in disagreement.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=36}} The new name was borrowed from a different Austrian party active at the time (the [[Austrian National Socialism|Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei]], i.e. the German National Socialist Workers' Party), although Hitler earlier suggested the party to be renamed the Social Revolutionary Party. It was [[Rudolf Jung]] who persuaded Hitler to adopt the NSDAP name.<ref>[[Konrad Heiden]], \"Les d\u00e9buts du national-socialisme\", Revue d'Allemagne, VII, No. 71 (Sept. 15, 1933), p. 821.</ref>\n\n== Membership ==\nEarly members of the party included:\n* [[Anton Drexler]]\n* [[Dietrich Eckart]]\n* [[Gottfried Feder]]\n* [[Karl Harrer]]\n* [[Hermann Esser]]\n* [[Ernst Boepple]]\n* [[Hans Frank]]\n* [[Adolf Hitler]]\n* [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]]\n* [[Alfred Rosenberg]]\n* [[Rudolf Jung]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J.

It was the precursor of the [[Nazi Party]], which was officially known as the National Socialist German Workers' Party ({{lang-de|Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei}}, NSDAP). The DAP only lasted from 5 January 1919 until 24 February 1920.\n\n== Origins ==\nOn 5 January 1919, the German Workers' Party (DAP) was founded in [[Munich]] in the hotel F\u00fcrstenfelder Hof by [[Anton Drexler]],{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} along with [[Dietrich Eckart]], [[Gottfried Feder]] and [[Karl Harrer]]. It developed out of the ''Freier Arbeiterausschuss f\u00fcr einen guten Frieden'' (Free Workers' Committee for a Good Peace) league, a branch of which Drexler had founded in 1918.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} Thereafter in 1918, Harrer (a journalist and member of the [[Thule Society]]), convinced Drexler and several others to form the ''[[Politischer Arbeiterzirkel]]'' (Political Workers' Circle).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} The members met periodically for discussions with themes of [[nationalism]] and [[antisemitism]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} Drexler was encouraged to form the DAP in December 1918 by his mentor, Dr. Paul Tafel. Tafel was a leader of the [[Alldeutscher Verband]] ([[Pan-Germanism|Pan-Germanist]] Union), a director of the [[MAN SE|Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N\u00fcrnberg]] and a member of the Thule Society. Drexler's wish was for a political party which was both in touch with the masses and [[nationalist]]. With the DAP founding in January 1919, Drexler was elected chairman and Harrer was made Reich Chairman, an honorary title.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=82, 83}} On 17 May, only ten members were present at the meeting, and a later meeting in August only noted 38 members attending.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=83}}\n\n=== Adolf Hitler's membership ===\n[[File:Hitler's DAP membership card.png|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]]'s DAP card with the membership number 7 (altered from the original)]]\nAfter [[World War I]] ended, [[Adolf Hitler]] returned to Munich. Having no formal education or career prospects, he tried to remain in the army for as long as possible.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=109}} In July 1919, he was appointed ''Verbindungsmann'' (intelligence agent) of an ''Aufkl\u00e4rungskommando'' (reconnaissance commando) of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' to influence other soldiers and to investigate the DAP. While monitoring the activities of the DAP, Hitler became attracted to founder Anton Drexler's anti-Semitic, nationalist, [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]], and [[anti-Marxist]] ideas.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} While attending a party meeting at the ''[[Sterneckerbr\u00e4u]]'' beer hall on 12 September 1919, Hitler became involved in a heated political argument with a visitor, Professor Baumann, who questioned the soundness of Gottfried Feder's arguments against capitalism and proposed that [[Bavaria]] should break away from [[Prussia]] and become part of a new South German nation with [[Austria]]. In vehemently attacking the man's arguments, he made an impression on the other party members with his oratory skills and, according to Hitler, Baumann left the hall acknowledging unequivocal defeat.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=75}} Impressed with Hitler's oratory skills, Drexler encouraged him to join. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=170}} Although Hitler initially wanted to form his own party, he claimed to have been convinced to join the DAP because it was small and he could eventually become its leader.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=126}}\n\nIn less than a week, Hitler received a postcard stating he had officially been accepted as a member and he should come to a committee meeting to discuss it. Hitler attended the committee meeting held at the run-down Altes Rosenbad beer-house.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=75, 76}} Normally, enlisted army personnel were not allowed to join political parties. In this case, Hitler had Captain [[Karl Mayr]]'s permission to join the DAP. Further, Hitler was allowed to stay in the army and receive his weekly pay of 20 gold marks a week.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=76}} At the time when Hitler joined the party, there were no membership numbers or cards. It was in January 1920 when a numeration was issued for the first time and listed in alphabetical order Hitler received the number 555. In reality, he had been the 55th member, but the counting started at the number 501 in order to make the party appear larger.{{sfn|Mitcham|1996|p=67}} In his work ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler later claimed to be the seventh party member, and he was in fact the seventh executive member of the party's central committee.<ref>Werner Maser, Der Sturm auf die Republik \u2013 Fr\u00fchgeschichte der NSDAP, ECON Verlag, D\u00fcsseldorf, Vienna, New York, Moscow, Special Edition 1994, {{ISBN|3-430-16373-0}}.</ref> After giving his first speech for the DAP on 16 October at the ''[[Hofbr\u00e4ukeller]]'', Hitler quickly became the party's most active orator. Hitler's considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership as crowds began to flock to hear his speeches during 1919\u20131920. With the support of Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920. Hitler preferred that role as he saw himself as the drummer for a national cause. He saw propaganda as the way to bring nationalism to the public.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=81, 84, 85, 89, 96}}\n\n=== From DAP to NSDAP ===\nThe small number of party members were quickly won over to [[Political views of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's political beliefs]]. He organized their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people for 24 February 1920 in the ''[[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus am Platzl|Staatliches Hofbr\u00e4uhaus in M\u00fcnchen]]''. Further in an attempt to make the party more broadly appealing to larger segments of the population, the DAP was renamed the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP) on 24 February.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=87}}{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1997|p=629}} Such was the significance of Hitler's particular move in publicity that Harrer resigned from the party in disagreement.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=36}} The new name was borrowed from a different Austrian party active at the time (the [[Austrian National Socialism|Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei]], i.e. the German National Socialist Workers' Party), although Hitler earlier suggested the party to be renamed the Social Revolutionary Party. It was [[Rudolf Jung]] who persuaded Hitler to adopt the NSDAP name.<ref>[[Konrad Heiden]], \"Les d\u00e9buts du national-socialisme\", Revue d'Allemagne, VII, No. 71 (Sept. 15, 1933), p. 821.</ref>\n\n== Membership ==\nEarly members of the party included:\n* [[Anton Drexler]]\n* [[Dietrich Eckart]]\n* [[Gottfried Feder]]\n* [[Karl Harrer]]\n* [[Hermann Esser]]\n* [[Ernst Boepple]]\n* [[Hans Frank]]\n* [[Adolf Hitler]]\n* [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]]\n* [[Alfred Rosenberg]]\n* [[Rudolf Jung]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J.

In the UK, the channel is available via digital satellite on [[Sky UK|Sky]], digital cable on [[Virgin Media]], IPTV on [[TalkTalk TV]] and online via [[Sky Go]].

At first the station struggled financially, due to disappointing ratings in the countries in which it was officially available, which in turn led to insufficient advertising revenue and increasing difficulty in covering the high transmission costs.\n\nOn 27 June 1983, the shareholders of Satellite Television agreed a \u00a35&nbsp;million offer to give [[News International]] 65% of the company.<ref>News International buys 65% of satellite group.

On 16 January 1984, the channel was renamed '''Sky Channel'''.\n\nSky Channel incorporated a large number of American imports in its schedules, while also increased the quantity produced of home grown programmes, including a number of new music programmes with [[Gary Davies]], [[Tony Blackburn]], [[Linda de Mol]], [[Pat Sharp]], [[David Jensen|David \"Kid\" Jensen]], and [[Anthea Turner]] presenting programmes such as ''Euro Top 40'', and ''UK Top 50 Chart''. New children's programmes like ''[[Fun Factory (TV series)|Fun Factory]]'' and ''[[The DJ Kat Show]]'', many of which came not only from Sky's own studios in London (having already abandoned the Molinare facilities by then), but also included programmes produced in the [[Netherlands]] by [[John de Mol]]'s [[Endemol|production company]].\n\nOn 8 June 1988, Murdoch announced his plans to expand Sky's service to four channels, thus creating the '''Sky Television''' network.<ref>The \u00a3199 dish that will launch a television revolution. by Richard Evans Media Editor. The Times, Thursday, 9 June 1988</ref> On 5 February 1989, the Sky Television Network (Sky Channel, Sky News, Sky Movies and Eurosport) was launched, At the same time, prime-time broadcasts to European cable operators ended, being replaced by Eurosport, a joint venture between Sky and the European Broadcasting Union, and aimed at a pan-European audience (like Sky Channel had been up to that point; for a time afterwards, some of Sky's previous pan-European programming continued to be broadcast before Eurosport's startup, under the branding of ''Sky Europe''). Initially, a new raft of shows were created, for the channel including ''Jameson Tonight'', ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (based more off the 1980s American version), ''[[The Price Is Right (UK game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''Frank Bough's World'' and ''Sky By Day'',<ref>From Sunday, you'll never say there's\u2026. Advert The Times (London, England), Friday, 3 February 1989; pg12</ref> Sky TV's variation on ITV's more popular ''This Morning'', hosted by former BBC Radio 1 DJ Tony Blackburn (who had moved to commercial radio by then) and former ''[[Magpie (TV series)|Magpie]]'' presenter Jenny Hanley. The show had a mix of entertainment, gossip, fashion, etc. The Channel continued with the same children's programmes, soaps, and US action series, [[WWE|WWF]] [[Professional wrestling|Wrestling]]. On 31 July 1989, the channel was renamed Sky One and closed in most European countries, broadcasting to only the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nIn 1990, Sky One began to acquire more recent programming, an early success being ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'', which the BBC had previously screened but not repeated. Sky One also picked new programming such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' and the last series of ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', and following its merger with BSB's [[Galaxy (UK TV channel)|Galaxy]], ''[[Parker Lewis Can't Lose]]''.\n\n===Sky Multichannels era===\n{{main|Sky Multichannels}}\nAfter many years in the clear, on 1 September 1993, Sky One was encrypted as part of the new [[Sky Multichannels]] subscription package, and could no longer be viewed outside Britain and Ireland without exporting a box, or receiving it over cable (although it had already been encrypted for a while since its original launch and first went in the clear in around 1987). The channel also commissioned a number of home grown programmes while also expanding its Australian television series to include ''[[E Street]]'', ''[[Chances (TV series)|Chances]]'' and ''[[Paradise Beach]]''. It continued to be the most-watched satellite channel in the UK and Ireland, a position it held for most of the 1990s, with many first-run US imports such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (which traditionally has been the channel's main selling-point, remaining a satellite exclusive until it finally made its terrestrial television appearance on [[BBC Two]] in 1996), ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]'', as well as some older programmes such as the various ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H*]]'', and [[Lucille Ball]]'s various comedy series.\n\nThe success of the channel led to the launch on 1 September 1996 of a companion channel, [[Sky Two#Original channel|Sky 2]]; however, it was not a success and was closed down on 31 August 1997, one day short of a year after it launched. In contrast to the [[Sky Two]] that was later relaunched, this channel featured even more first-run programmes, and it broadcast only at night, between 7&nbsp;pm and 6&nbsp;am.\n\n=== Recent years ===\nIn 2000, a dedicated feed of Sky One for Ireland was launched. For most of this Irish feed's existence, the only difference between it and the United Kingdom feed has been differing commercials and programme promotions. In June 2003, the channel started broadcasting in [[16:9]] [[widescreen]].<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a11015/sky-confirms-expansion-of-widescreen-broadcasting.html | title = Sky confirms expansion of widescreen broadcasting | date = 2 May 2003 |accessdate=2 August 2007 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |author=Jay, Alan}}\n</ref> However, all TV commercials were broadcast in [[Aspect ratio (image)|4:3]] until November 2005,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} because they were played off the same servers for all Sky channels, many of which were not broadcast in widescreen.\n\nOn 21 September 2004, Sky One Mix was subsequently renamed Sky Mix. On 31 October 2005, Sky Mix was renamed as [[Sky Two]] with the launch of a second sister channel [[Pick (TV channel)|Sky Three]].\n\nOn 25 August 2012, it was announced by [[Stuart Murphy]], director of Sky entertainment channels, that a one-hour [[timeshift channel|timeshift]] of Sky One, [[Sky Witness|Sky Living]]\nand [[Sky Atlantic]] would launch in the Autumn of 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2012/aug/25/stuart-murphy-sky-launch-new-sky-channels-video|title=Sky's Stuart Murphy announces the launch of two new channels \u2013 video|author1=Andy Gallagher |author2=Josh Strauss |author3=Emily Brinnand  |last-author-amp=yes |date=25 August 2012|work=[[guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref> with the former launching on 12 November 2012.

As of 2017, The Simpsons is available to watch on the timeshifted channel.\n\nFor New Year's Day 2014, Sky One was temporarily renamed to Sky Onesie \"to encourage viewers to snuggle up in front of the television wearing [[onesie (jumpsuit)|onesie]]s, in a bid to recover from the previous night's celebrations\".\n\nSince 2017 Sky One has broadcast some sports coverage. This includes a partial simulcast of ''[[Soccer Saturday]]'', highlights of, and occasional live coverage of, [[Formula One]] motor racing and a few [[Premier League]] football matches were shown on the channel during the 2018/19 season. The summer of 2019 saw Sky One show highlights of the [[2019 Cricket World Cup]] and live coverage of England's matches in the [[2019 Netball World Cup]].\n\n==Sky One HD==\nTo coincide with the launch of [[Sky+ HD|Sky HD]], Sky One HD began broadcasting on 22 May 2006. The channel is a [[simulcast]] of Sky One and screens [[High-definition television|high-definition]] versions of some of the channel's programming, which include ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[WWE Smackdown]]'',  ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', ''[[Prison Break]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', and most recently new episodes of ''[[The Simpsons#Animation|The Simpsons]]''. Programmes that are not available in HD are \"upscaled\" (although Sky One showed the widescreen film ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', unlike most US broadcasts, since the film was originally filmed on [[Panavision]] widescreen film but cropped to full-screen by most broadcasters. This airing of the original film preserves the film's appearance without stretching or upscaling, although some scenes were compromised for widescreen and had to be upscaled).\n\nSky have stated that they intend to increase the amount of HD content they show, and hoped that by the end of 2008, two-thirds of all [[Prime time#United Kingdom|prime time]] shows, and 90% of their own original commissions, would be in HD.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a58126/sky-promises-more-hd-programming.html |title= Sky promises more HD programming | date = 22 May 2007 |work=Digital Spy |author=Wilkes, Neil}}</ref> A new logo was introduced along with the rebrand on 31 August 2008.\n\nOn 1 October 2010, Sky One HD launched on [[Virgin Media]] channel 122, with [[Sky Two]] moving to channel 123 and [[Pick (TV channel)|Sky 3]] (now Pick) moving to channel 180 on 22 September 2010, to make way for the new channel.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.theairwaves.net/index.php/cable/4263-sky1-hd-to-launch-on-vm-on-friday |title=Sky1 HD to launch on VM on Friday |work=TheAirwaves |date=28 September 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724100437/http://www.theairwaves.net/index.php/cable/4263-sky1-hd-to-launch-on-vm-on-friday |archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Virgin Media dispute==\nOn 1 March 2007, at midnight, Sky's basic channels, which included Sky One, [[Sky Two]], [[Pick (TV channel)|Sky Three]], [[Sky News]], [[Sky Sports News]], [[Sky Travel]] and Sky Travel Extra were removed from the [[Virgin Media]] cable television services after a dispute between Virgin Media and BSkyB.

Telewest was unwilling to pay extra to keep the channels and preferred to simply drop them. Other [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] owned channels remained such as [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]] and [[Comedy Central (UK and Irish TV channel)|the former Paramount Comedy 1]]. The reaction to this by customers was fairly large and many left the provider to rival Sky, others were retained as Telewest offered them a free upgrade to the [[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)|Disney Channel]] for periods of between one and three months, others were reportedly offered upgrades to [[Sky Movies]] packages in a desperate attempt to keep them from leaving. The Nickelodeon channels returned to the Telewest platform on 12 February 2005 following successful renegotiations in Nickelodeon's favour.\n\nAt the beginning of March 2008, the two companies were reported to have resumed discussions over the dispute. Virgin chief executive [[Virgin Media|Neil Berkett]] was reported as saying they had \"continued interest in securing Sky basics back on our platform\". The resumed talks had followed shortly after both Virgin and [[Sky plc|BSkyB]] had launched appeals against a recent [[Competition Appeal Tribunal]] ruling on BSkyB's 17.9% stake in [[ITV plc]].<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/02/virginmedia |title= Virgin in talks to resolve dispute over Sky channels |date=2 March 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London | author=Robinson, James}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a90679/talks-resume-over-sky-carriage-dispute.html |title= 'Talks resume' over Sky carriage dispute |date=3 March 2008 |work=Digital Spy |author=West, Dave}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 November 2008, a carriage deal between BSkyB and [[Virgin Media]] channels was reached and BSkyB's channels were available on Virgin's cable service from 13 November 2008.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a134623/sky1-sky-news-back-on-virgin-cable.html |title=Sky1, Sky News back on Virgin cable |date=4 November 2008 |work=Digital Spy |first=James |last=Welsh}}</ref><ref name=\"techradar.com\">{{Cite news |url= http://www.techradar.com/news/television/sky-one-back-on-virgin-media-481770| title = Sky1 returns to Virgin Media|date=4 November 2008| work=TechRadar |first=Patrick |last=Goss}}</ref> The Sky basic channels were spread across each tier of Virgin's cable TV service: Sky3 and Sky News were made available in the lowest M tier; Sky Sports News joined the M+ tier; Sky 1 and Sky 2 were made available in the L tier; and Sky Arts 1, Sky Arts 2, Sky Real Lives and Sky Real Lives 2 joined the XL tier.<ref name=\"techradar.com\"/>\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programmes broadcast by Sky One}}\n[[Image:SkyOneShare v2.png|Sky One share of viewing 1992\u20132008.

Another early and long-running fixture was ''[[Married... with Children]]'', which ran all through the 1990s, but in the early 2000s, the show suddenly disappeared from its regular schedule and has not been screened on any Sky channel since.\n\nSky One was also the original home to the UK's first-run showings of episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'', for series 4\u20136 of both shows (Channel 4 had shown series 1\u20133 first), giving Sky One some of the highest ratings for any satellite channel. In 2000, 2.8&nbsp;million viewers watched an episode of ''Friends'', the highest-rated show on any satellite channel. However, when [[Channel 4]] launched their own digital sister channel [[E4 (channel)|E4]] they outbid Sky One for exclusive first-run rights to both shows.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/channel-4s-record-pound125m-bid-for-friends-and-er-sees-off-sky-739017.html</ref> However, Sky One still held the repeat rights for the early series of both shows for several years. Since 2011, ''Friends'' has been shown on [[Comedy Central (UK and Irish TV channel)|Comedy Central]] and [[ITV3]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Szalai|first1=Georg|title='Friends' to Stay on Comedy Central UK|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/friends-stay-comedy-central-uk-814766|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=3 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSky One previously broadcast [[WWE]] programming before it was moved to [[Sky Sports]].

During the early years new game shows including a few series of ''[[Blockbusters (UK game show)|Blockbusters]]'' and [[Spellbound (game show)|Spellbound]], along with Price is Right and Sale of the Century. Original drama ''[[Dream Team (TV series)|Dream Team]]'', a series based on a fictional [[association football|football]] team; ''[[The Strangerers]]'' (a [[science fiction sitcom]] that was dropped after one series and never repeated); [[Al Murray]]'s sitcom ''[[Time Gentlemen Please]]''; and ''[[Baddiel's Syndrome]]''. ''[[Hex (TV series)|Hex]]'', another sci-fi show, had proved popular but was cancelled in April 2006 and ''[[Mile High]]'' also proved quite popular but it only lasted from 2003\u20132005. Sky One commissioned ''[[Terry Pratchett's Hogfather]]'' for Christmas 2006 proving to be their most successful programme ever. Following the success of [[The Hogfather]], Sky brought out in 2008 an adaptation of ''[[The Colour of Magic (TV film)|The Colour of Magic]]'' and its second half ''[[The Light Fantastic]]'', and in 2010 ''[[Terry Pratchett's Going Postal]]'', the 33rd book in [[The Discworld]] series. Sky also co-produced ''[[The 4400]]'' and co-financed the first series of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.\n\nIt also screened many \"reality\" shows such as ''[[Cruise with Stelios]]'', ''[[Road Wars (TV series)|Road Wars]]'', ''[[Shock Treatment (TV series)|Shock Treatment]]'', ''[[World's Deadliest Gangs]]'', ''[[Pineapple Dance Studios (TV series)|Pineapple Dance Studios]]'', ''[[World of Pain (TV show)|World of Pain]]'', ''[[Road Raja]]'', ''[[Ibiza Uncovered]]'', ''[[Cirque de Celebrit\u00e9]]'' and ''[[Hairspray: The School Musical]]''. It also has received success with entertainment science shows ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]'' and spin-offs, ''[[Brainiac: History Abuse]]'' and ''[[Brainiac's Test Tube Baby]]'' and also ''[[Mission Implausible]]''. Less successful shows include ''[[Harry Enfield's Brand Spanking New Show]]''.\n\nSky One have also commissioned a number of game shows including ''[[Blockbusters (UK game show)|Blockbusters]]''. The most recent game show was from [[Mark Burnett]], ''[[Are You Smarter Than A 10 Year Old? (UK)|Are You Smarter Than a 10-Year-Old]]'', based on a United States format. On 30 January 2008, Sky One announced plans to bring back the UK 1990s game show ''[[Gladiators (2008 UK TV series)|Gladiators]]'' which was subsequently cancelled in 2009.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/30/bskyb.television | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | title=Sky One to bring back 90s favourite Gladiators | date=30 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Sky One also commissioned several new comedies including ''[[A League of Their Own (UK game show)|A League of Their Own]]'', ''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'' and ''[[Little Crackers]]''.\n\nFrom 2011, Sky One has premiered several new comedy series including the supermarket sitcom ''[[Trollied]]'', which had broadcast six series and over fifty episodes, becoming Sky One's longest running comedy series. ''[[Parents (TV series)|Parents]]'', another series, was broadcast in 2012 and was not well received, forcing Sky not to commission it for a second series. ''[[Moone Boy]]'', a series written by and starring [[Chris O'Dowd]] first screened in 2012, became an instant hit internationally. It lasted three series, and ended in 2015.\n\n==Continuity announcers==\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\nOld announcer is [[Trans World Sport|Bruce Hammal]] between 1984 to 1997,\n[[Absolute Radio]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Claire Sturgess]] has been a \"voice\" of Sky One since 1998, and was the sole announcer from 2001 until 2005.

The Times, Thursday, 9 June 1988</ref> On 5 February 1989, the Sky Television Network (Sky Channel, Sky News, Sky Movies and Eurosport) was launched, At the same time, prime-time broadcasts to European cable operators ended, being replaced by Eurosport, a joint venture between Sky and the European Broadcasting Union, and aimed at a pan-European audience (like Sky Channel had been up to that point; for a time afterwards, some of Sky's previous pan-European programming continued to be broadcast before Eurosport's startup, under the branding of ''Sky Europe''). Initially, a new raft of shows were created, for the channel including ''Jameson Tonight'', ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (based more off the 1980s American version), ''[[The Price Is Right (UK game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''Frank Bough's World'' and ''Sky By Day'',<ref>From Sunday, you'll never say there's\u2026. Advert The Times (London, England), Friday, 3 February 1989; pg12</ref> Sky TV's variation on ITV's more popular ''This Morning'', hosted by former BBC Radio 1 DJ Tony Blackburn (who had moved to commercial radio by then) and former ''[[Magpie (TV series)|Magpie]]'' presenter Jenny Hanley. The show had a mix of entertainment, gossip, fashion, etc. The Channel continued with the same children's programmes, soaps, and US action series, [[WWE|WWF]] [[Professional wrestling|Wrestling]]. On 31 July 1989, the channel was renamed Sky One and closed in most European countries, broadcasting to only the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nIn 1990, Sky One began to acquire more recent programming, an early success being ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'', which the BBC had previously screened but not repeated. Sky One also picked new programming such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' and the last series of ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', and following its merger with BSB's [[Galaxy (UK TV channel)|Galaxy]], ''[[Parker Lewis Can't Lose]]''.\n\n===Sky Multichannels era===\n{{main|Sky Multichannels}}\nAfter many years in the clear, on 1 September 1993, Sky One was encrypted as part of the new [[Sky Multichannels]] subscription package, and could no longer be viewed outside Britain and Ireland without exporting a box, or receiving it over cable (although it had already been encrypted for a while since its original launch and first went in the clear in around 1987). The channel also commissioned a number of home grown programmes while also expanding its Australian television series to include ''[[E Street]]'', ''[[Chances (TV series)|Chances]]'' and ''[[Paradise Beach]]''. It continued to be the most-watched satellite channel in the UK and Ireland, a position it held for most of the 1990s, with many first-run US imports such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (which traditionally has been the channel's main selling-point, remaining a satellite exclusive until it finally made its terrestrial television appearance on [[BBC Two]] in 1996), ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]'', as well as some older programmes such as the various ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H*]]'', and [[Lucille Ball]]'s various comedy series.\n\nThe success of the channel led to the launch on 1 September 1996 of a companion channel, [[Sky Two#Original channel|Sky 2]]; however, it was not a success and was closed down on 31 August 1997, one day short of a year after it launched. In contrast to the [[Sky Two]] that was later relaunched, this channel featured even more first-run programmes, and it broadcast only at night, between 7&nbsp;pm and 6&nbsp;am.\n\n=== Recent years ===\nIn 2000, a dedicated feed of Sky One for Ireland was launched. For most of this Irish feed's existence, the only difference between it and the United Kingdom feed has been differing commercials and programme promotions. In June 2003, the channel started broadcasting in [[16:9]] [[widescreen]].<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a11015/sky-confirms-expansion-of-widescreen-broadcasting.html | title = Sky confirms expansion of widescreen broadcasting | date = 2 May 2003 |accessdate=2 August 2007 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |author=Jay, Alan}}\n</ref> However, all TV commercials were broadcast in [[Aspect ratio (image)|4:3]] until November 2005,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} because they were played off the same servers for all Sky channels, many of which were not broadcast in widescreen.\n\nOn 21 September 2004, Sky One Mix was subsequently renamed Sky Mix.

This includes a partial simulcast of ''[[Soccer Saturday]]'', highlights of, and occasional live coverage of, [[Formula One]] motor racing and a few [[Premier League]] football matches were shown on the channel during the 2018/19 season. The summer of 2019 saw Sky One show highlights of the [[2019 Cricket World Cup]] and live coverage of England's matches in the [[2019 Netball World Cup]].\n\n==Sky One HD==\nTo coincide with the launch of [[Sky+ HD|Sky HD]], Sky One HD began broadcasting on 22 May 2006. The channel is a [[simulcast]] of Sky One and screens [[High-definition television|high-definition]] versions of some of the channel's programming, which include ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[WWE Smackdown]]'',  ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', ''[[Prison Break]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', and most recently new episodes of ''[[The Simpsons#Animation|The Simpsons]]''. Programmes that are not available in HD are \"upscaled\" (although Sky One showed the widescreen film ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', unlike most US broadcasts, since the film was originally filmed on [[Panavision]] widescreen film but cropped to full-screen by most broadcasters. This airing of the original film preserves the film's appearance without stretching or upscaling, although some scenes were compromised for widescreen and had to be upscaled).\n\nSky have stated that they intend to increase the amount of HD content they show, and hoped that by the end of 2008, two-thirds of all [[Prime time#United Kingdom|prime time]] shows, and 90% of their own original commissions, would be in HD.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a58126/sky-promises-more-hd-programming.html |title= Sky promises more HD programming | date = 22 May 2007 |work=Digital Spy |author=Wilkes, Neil}}</ref> A new logo was introduced along with the rebrand on 31 August 2008.\n\nOn 1 October 2010, Sky One HD launched on [[Virgin Media]] channel 122, with [[Sky Two]] moving to channel 123 and [[Pick (TV channel)|Sky 3]] (now Pick) moving to channel 180 on 22 September 2010, to make way for the new channel.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.theairwaves.net/index.php/cable/4263-sky1-hd-to-launch-on-vm-on-friday |title=Sky1 HD to launch on VM on Friday |work=TheAirwaves |date=28 September 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724100437/http://www.theairwaves.net/index.php/cable/4263-sky1-hd-to-launch-on-vm-on-friday |archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Virgin Media dispute==\nOn 1 March 2007, at midnight, Sky's basic channels, which included Sky One, [[Sky Two]], [[Pick (TV channel)|Sky Three]], [[Sky News]], [[Sky Sports News]], [[Sky Travel]] and Sky Travel Extra were removed from the [[Virgin Media]] cable television services after a dispute between Virgin Media and BSkyB.

Telewest was unwilling to pay extra to keep the channels and preferred to simply drop them. Other [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] owned channels remained such as [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV]] and [[Comedy Central (UK and Irish TV channel)|the former Paramount Comedy 1]]. The reaction to this by customers was fairly large and many left the provider to rival Sky, others were retained as Telewest offered them a free upgrade to the [[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)|Disney Channel]] for periods of between one and three months, others were reportedly offered upgrades to [[Sky Movies]] packages in a desperate attempt to keep them from leaving. The Nickelodeon channels returned to the Telewest platform on 12 February 2005 following successful renegotiations in Nickelodeon's favour.\n\nAt the beginning of March 2008, the two companies were reported to have resumed discussions over the dispute.

''[[The Simpsons]]'' has been airing on Sky One since both of its early years, making the series not only the longest-running programme on Sky One but also the longest-running primetime animated series to date. As many as five episodes of said show are broadcast each evening, with any new episodes generally being shown on Sunday.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Munn|first1=Patrick|title=Sky1 Sets UK Premiere Date For 'The Simpsons' Season 28 - TVWise|url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2016/12/sky1-sets-uk-premiere-date-simpsons-season-28/|accessdate=27 May 2017|work=TVWise|date=15 December 2016}}</ref> Sky One has exclusive rights in the UK to show the most recent series of ''The Simpsons''. Another early and long-running fixture was ''[[Married... with Children]]'', which ran all through the 1990s, but in the early 2000s, the show suddenly disappeared from its regular schedule and has not been screened on any Sky channel since.\n\nSky One was also the original home to the UK's first-run showings of episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'', for series 4\u20136 of both shows (Channel 4 had shown series 1\u20133 first), giving Sky One some of the highest ratings for any satellite channel. In 2000, 2.8&nbsp;million viewers watched an episode of ''Friends'', the highest-rated show on any satellite channel. However, when [[Channel 4]] launched their own digital sister channel [[E4 (channel)|E4]] they outbid Sky One for exclusive first-run rights to both shows.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/channel-4s-record-pound125m-bid-for-friends-and-er-sees-off-sky-739017.html</ref> However, Sky One still held the repeat rights for the early series of both shows for several years. Since 2011, ''Friends'' has been shown on [[Comedy Central (UK and Irish TV channel)|Comedy Central]] and [[ITV3]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Szalai|first1=Georg|title='Friends' to Stay on Comedy Central UK|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/friends-stay-comedy-central-uk-814766|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=3 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSky One previously broadcast [[WWE]] programming before it was moved to [[Sky Sports]]. However, Sky One did continue to broadcast an edited one hour version of [[WWE Raw]] on Sunday mornings before all WWE programming moved to rival network [[BT Sport]].<ref>https://sport.bt.com/wwe/bt-sport-and-wwe-announce-exclusive-new-tv-partnership-in-multi-year-deal-S11364370135846</ref>\n\nSky One occasionally screens older [[20th Century Fox]] films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' as part of its evening schedule ([[21st Century Fox]] formally owned a controlling minority stake in Sky) although they are shown with ad breaks, unlike films on premium film channels, for example [[Sky Cinema]] and its sister channels.\n\n===Programmes commissioned by Sky One===\nSky has commissioned many homegrown programmes since it first started broadcasting back in 1984, but it was not until 1989 when content went beyond music and children reprogramming. During the early years new game shows including a few series of ''[[Blockbusters (UK game show)|Blockbusters]]'' and [[Spellbound (game show)|Spellbound]], along with Price is Right and Sale of the Century. Original drama ''[[Dream Team (TV series)|Dream Team]]'', a series based on a fictional [[association football|football]] team; ''[[The Strangerers]]'' (a [[science fiction sitcom]] that was dropped after one series and never repeated); [[Al Murray]]'s sitcom ''[[Time Gentlemen Please]]''; and ''[[Baddiel's Syndrome]]''. ''[[Hex (TV series)|Hex]]'', another sci-fi show, had proved popular but was cancelled in April 2006 and ''[[Mile High]]'' also proved quite popular but it only lasted from 2003\u20132005. Sky One commissioned ''[[Terry Pratchett's Hogfather]]'' for Christmas 2006 proving to be their most successful programme ever. Following the success of [[The Hogfather]], Sky brought out in 2008 an adaptation of ''[[The Colour of Magic (TV film)|The Colour of Magic]]'' and its second half ''[[The Light Fantastic]]'', and in 2010 ''[[Terry Pratchett's Going Postal]]'', the 33rd book in [[The Discworld]] series. Sky also co-produced ''[[The 4400]]'' and co-financed the first series of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.\n\nIt also screened many \"reality\" shows such as ''[[Cruise with Stelios]]'', ''[[Road Wars (TV series)|Road Wars]]'', ''[[Shock Treatment (TV series)|Shock Treatment]]'', ''[[World's Deadliest Gangs]]'', ''[[Pineapple Dance Studios (TV series)|Pineapple Dance Studios]]'', ''[[World of Pain (TV show)|World of Pain]]'', ''[[Road Raja]]'', ''[[Ibiza Uncovered]]'', ''[[Cirque de Celebrit\u00e9]]'' and ''[[Hairspray: The School Musical]]''. It also has received success with entertainment science shows ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]'' and spin-offs, ''[[Brainiac: History Abuse]]'' and ''[[Brainiac's Test Tube Baby]]'' and also ''[[Mission Implausible]]''. Less successful shows include ''[[Harry Enfield's Brand Spanking New Show]]''.\n\nSky One have also commissioned a number of game shows including ''[[Blockbusters (UK game show)|Blockbusters]]''. The most recent game show was from [[Mark Burnett]], ''[[Are You Smarter Than A 10 Year Old? (UK)|Are You Smarter Than a 10-Year-Old]]'', based on a United States format. On 30 January 2008, Sky One announced plans to bring back the UK 1990s game show ''[[Gladiators (2008 UK TV series)|Gladiators]]'' which was subsequently cancelled in 2009.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/30/bskyb.television | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | title=Sky One to bring back 90s favourite Gladiators | date=30 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Sky One also commissioned several new comedies including ''[[A League of Their Own (UK game show)|A League of Their Own]]'', ''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'' and ''[[Little Crackers]]''.\n\nFrom 2011, Sky One has premiered several new comedy series including the supermarket sitcom ''[[Trollied]]'', which had broadcast six series and over fifty episodes, becoming Sky One's longest running comedy series. ''[[Parents (TV series)|Parents]]'', another series, was broadcast in 2012 and was not well received, forcing Sky not to commission it for a second series. ''[[Moone Boy]]'', a series written by and starring [[Chris O'Dowd]] first screened in 2012, became an instant hit internationally. It lasted three series, and ended in 2015.\n\n==Continuity announcers==\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\nOld announcer is [[Trans World Sport|Bruce Hammal]] between 1984 to 1997,\n[[Absolute Radio]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Claire Sturgess]] has been a \"voice\" of Sky One since 1998, and was the sole announcer from 2001 until 2005.

A new form of metrical epic-poems (called ''Chhanda-Kabya'') evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote ''Haravali.'' [[Upendra Bhanja]] took a leading role in this period- his creations ''Baidehisha Bilasa'', ''Koti Brahmanda Sundari'', ''Labanyabati'' were landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Dasa's ''Rasokallola'' and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara's ''Bidagdha Chintamani'' are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are Baladeba Rath, Bhima Bhoi, [[Brajanath Badajena]] and Gopala Krushna Pattanaik.\n* Modern Odia (1850 till present day): The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolution in Odia literature and language.\n\n===Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Odia language===\nThe beginning of Odia poetry coincide with the development of ''charya sahitya'', the literature started by [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist poets such as in the [[Charyapada]]. This literature was written in a specific metaphor called [[twilight language]] and prominent poets included [[Luipa]], [[Tilopa]] and [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]]. Quite importantly, the [[raga]]s that are mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in later Odia literature.\n\n===Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution===\n[[Jayadeva]] was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an [[Utkala Brahmin]] family of Puri in circa 1200&nbsp;AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem [[Gita Govinda]], which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of [[Works of Jayadeva|Jayadeva's literary contribution]] changed the pattern of versification in Odia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n==Phonology==\n[[File:Odia phonology.webm|thumb|Pronunciation of [[Odia alphabet]].]]\nOdia has 29 consonant phonemes, 2 semivowel phonemes and 6 vowel phonemes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Odia vowel phonemes<ref name=\":0\">{{harvcoltxt|Ray|2003|p=526}}</ref>\n! ||[[Front vowel|Front]]||[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n![[High vowel|High]]\n|{{IPA|i}}||{{IPA|u}}\n|-\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|{{IPA|e}}||{{IPA|o}}\n|-\n![[Low vowel|Low]]\n|{{IPA|a}}|||{{IPA|\u0254}}\n|}\n\nLong vowels are not necessary because they all become short.

Rama-Bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.\n\nThe following era is termed the [[Odia Literature|Panchasakha Age]] and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of [[Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature.  Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], Yasovanta, Ananta and [[Acyutananda]]. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the [[Usabhilasa]] of [[Sisu Sankara Dasa]], the [[Rahasya-manjari]] of [[Deva-durlabha Dasa]] and the Rukmini-bibha of [[Kartikka Dasa]]. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when [[Ramachandra Pattanayaka]] wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, [[Bhima Bhoi]], [[Dhivara]], [[Sadasiva]] and [[Sisu Isvara-dasa]] composed another form called [[kavyas]] (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.\n\nHowever, during the [[Odia literature#Age of Upendra Bhanja|Bhanja Age]] (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet [[Upendra Bhanja]] (1670\u20131720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.\n\nThe first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] and [[Assamese alphabet|Assamese scripts]], the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the [[Tamil script]] and [[Telugu script]]. [[Amos Sutton]] produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841\u201343) and<ref>Biswamoy Pati Situating social history: Orissa, 1800\u20131997 p30</ref> ''An Introductory Grammar of Oriya'' (1844).<ref>The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti):   2 p1030 ed. Amaresh Datta \u2013 2006 \"Amos Sutton also prepared a dictionary named Sadhu bhasharthabhidhan, a vocabulary of current Sanskrit terms with Odia definitions which was also printed in Odisha Mission Press in 1844.\"</ref>\n\nOdia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. [[Sarala Dasa]] who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the [[Vyasa]] of Odisha. He translated the [[Mahabharata]] into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, [[Ramayana]] and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially [[worship|devotional]] poetry.\n\nOther eminent Odia poets include [[Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja]] and [[Kavisurya Baladev Rath|Kabisurya Baladev Ratha]].\n\nProse in the language has had a late development.\n\nThree great poets and prose writers, [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]] (1849\u20131908), [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843\u20131918) and [[Madhusudan Rao]] (1853\u20131912)  made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).\n\nAmong the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924\u20131936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.\n\nOne of the great writers in the 19th century was Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] (1907\u20131995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like ''Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala'', etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971\u201372 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.\n\nOne of the prominent writers of the 19th and 20th centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927\u20132002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.\n\n20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875\u20131928), [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862\u20131924), [[Chintamani Mahanti]] and [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]], besides [[Niladri Dasa]] and [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877\u20131928). The most notable novelists were [[Umesa Sarakara]], [[Divyasimha Panigrahi]], [[Gopala Praharaja]] and [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]]. [[Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray]] is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were [[Godabarisha Mohapatra]], [[Mayadhara Manasimha]], [[Nityananda Mahapatra]] and [[Kunjabihari Dasa]]. [[Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi]] is known for his translations of some western classics apart from [[Udayanatha Shadangi]], [[Sunanda Kara]] and [[Surendranatha Dwivedi]]. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor [[Girija Shankar Ray]], [[Pandit Vinayaka Misra]], Professor [[Gauri Kumara Brahma]], [[Jagabandhu Simha]] and [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the [[Odia people]] who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilization in the field of art and literature.

A new form of metrical epic-poems (called ''Chhanda-Kabya'') evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote ''Haravali.'' [[Upendra Bhanja]] took a leading role in this period- his creations ''Baidehisha Bilasa'', ''Koti Brahmanda Sundari'', ''Labanyabati'' were landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Dasa's ''Rasokallola'' and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara's ''Bidagdha Chintamani'' are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are Baladeba Rath, Bhima Bhoi, [[Brajanath Badajena]] and Gopala Krushna Pattanaik.\n* Modern Odia (1850 till present day): The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolution in Odia literature and language.\n\n===Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Odia language===\nThe beginning of Odia poetry coincide with the development of ''charya sahitya'', the literature started by [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist poets such as in the [[Charyapada]]. This literature was written in a specific metaphor called [[twilight language]] and prominent poets included [[Luipa]], [[Tilopa]] and [[Kanha (poet)|Kanha]]. Quite importantly, the [[raga]]s that are mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in later Odia literature.\n\n===Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution===\n[[Jayadeva]] was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an [[Utkala Brahmin]] family of Puri in circa 1200&nbsp;AD. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem [[Gita Govinda]], which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of [[Works of Jayadeva|Jayadeva's literary contribution]] changed the pattern of versification in Odia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n==Phonology==\n[[File:Odia phonology.webm|thumb|Pronunciation of [[Odia alphabet]].]]\nOdia has 29 consonant phonemes, 2 semivowel phonemes and 6 vowel phonemes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Odia vowel phonemes<ref name=\":0\">{{harvcoltxt|Ray|2003|p=526}}</ref>\n! ||[[Front vowel|Front]]||[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n![[High vowel|High]]\n|{{IPA|i}}||{{IPA|u}}\n|-\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|{{IPA|e}}||{{IPA|o}}\n|-\n![[Low vowel|Low]]\n|{{IPA|a}}|||{{IPA|\u0254}}\n|}\n\nLong vowels are not necessary because they all become short.

Rama-Bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.\n\nThe following era is termed the [[Odia Literature|Panchasakha Age]] and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of [[Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature.  Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], Yasovanta, Ananta and [[Acyutananda]]. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the [[Usabhilasa]] of [[Sisu Sankara Dasa]], the [[Rahasya-manjari]] of [[Deva-durlabha Dasa]] and the Rukmini-bibha of [[Kartikka Dasa]]. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when [[Ramachandra Pattanayaka]] wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, [[Bhima Bhoi]], [[Dhivara]], [[Sadasiva]] and [[Sisu Isvara-dasa]] composed another form called [[kavyas]] (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.\n\nHowever, during the [[Odia literature#Age of Upendra Bhanja|Bhanja Age]] (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, obscenity and eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet [[Upendra Bhanja]] (1670\u20131720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.\n\nThe first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali]] and [[Assamese alphabet|Assamese scripts]], the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the [[Tamil script]] and [[Telugu script]]. [[Amos Sutton]] produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841\u201343) and<ref>Biswamoy Pati Situating social history: Orissa, 1800\u20131997 p30</ref> ''An Introductory Grammar of Oriya'' (1844).<ref>The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti):   2 p1030 ed. Amaresh Datta \u2013 2006 \"Amos Sutton also prepared a dictionary named Sadhu bhasharthabhidhan, a vocabulary of current Sanskrit terms with Odia definitions which was also printed in Odisha Mission Press in 1844.\"</ref>\n\nOdia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. [[Sarala Dasa]] who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the [[Vyasa]] of Odisha. He translated the [[Mahabharata]] into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, [[Ramayana]] and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially [[worship|devotional]] poetry.\n\nOther eminent Odia poets include [[Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja]] and [[Kavisurya Baladev Rath|Kabisurya Baladev Ratha]].\n\nProse in the language has had a late development.\n\nThree great poets and prose writers, [[Kabibar Radhanath Ray]] (1849\u20131908), [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]] (1843\u20131918) and [[Madhusudan Rao]] (1853\u20131912)  made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).\n\nAmong the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924\u20131936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.\n\nOne of the great writers in the 19th century was Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] (1907\u20131995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like ''Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala'', etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971\u201372 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.\n\nOne of the prominent writers of the 19th and 20th centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927\u20132002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.\n\n20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi [[Nanda Kishore Bal]] (1875\u20131928), [[Gangadhar Meher]] (1862\u20131924), [[Chintamani Mahanti]] and [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]], besides [[Niladri Dasa]] and [[Gopabandhu Das]] (1877\u20131928). The most notable novelists were [[Umesa Sarakara]], [[Divyasimha Panigrahi]], [[Gopala Praharaja]] and [[Kalindi Charan Panigrahi]]. [[Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray]] is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were [[Godabarisha Mohapatra]], [[Mayadhara Manasimha]], [[Nityananda Mahapatra]] and [[Kunjabihari Dasa]]. [[Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi]] is known for his translations of some western classics apart from [[Udayanatha Shadangi]], [[Sunanda Kara]] and [[Surendranatha Dwivedi]]. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor [[Girija Shankar Ray]], [[Pandit Vinayaka Misra]], Professor [[Gauri Kumara Brahma]], [[Jagabandhu Simha]] and [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the [[Odia people]] who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilization in the field of art and literature. Now Writers [[Manoj Das]]'s creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle .Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include [[Fakir Mohan Senapati]], [[Madhusudan Das]], Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, [[Surendra Mohanty]], [[Manoj Das]],  Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, Bhikari Rath, [[Jagadish Mohanty]], [[Sarojini Sahoo]], [[Yashodhara Mishra]], Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal.
