The airport property division stated that the hangar was built in the 1960s and renovated in the 1970s. [[Eastern Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]] had previously occupied the hangar. Delta's lease originally was scheduled to expire in 2010, but the airline returned the lease to the City of Atlanta in 2005 as part of its bankruptcy settlement. The city collected an insurance settlement of almost $900,000 as a result of the cancellation.<ref name=\"TobinRamosSams\" />\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n=== Passenger ===\n{{Airport destination list | 3rdcoltitle = Refs | 3rdcolunsortable=yes\n<!--DO NOT ADD TERMINAL/CONCOURSE INFORMATION TO THIS TABLE AS IT VIOLATES [[WP:NOTTRAVEL]]-->\n<!-- -->\n| {{nowrap|[[Air Canada Express]]}} | [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto\u2013Pearson]] | <ref name=\"AirCanadaRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight Schedules|url=https://www.aircanada.com/us/en/aco/home/book/routes-and-partners/flight-schedules.html|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330083955/https://www.aircanada.com/us/en/aco/home/book/routes-and-partners/flight-schedules.html|archive-date=March 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Air Choice One]] | [[McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport|Jackson (TN)]] | <ref name=\"AtlantaGaAirChoiceOne\">{{cite web |title=Flights to Atlanta, GA |url=https://www.airchoiceone.com/destinations/flights-to-atlanta-ga/ |publisher=Air Choice One |access-date=March 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302104102/https://www.airchoiceone.com/destinations/flights-to-atlanta-ga/ |archive-date=March 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Air France]] | [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]] | <ref name=\"AirFranceRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Horaires|url=https://www.airfrance.co.uk/GB/en/local/resainfovol/horaires/horaires.do|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419122802/http://www.airfrance.co.uk/GB/en/local/resainfovol/horaires/horaires.do|archive-date=April 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Alaska Airlines]] | [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport|Seattle/Tacoma]] | <ref name=\"AlaskaRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight timetable|url=https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/timetables.aspx|website=Alaskaair.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202123138/https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/timetables.aspx|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Airlines]] | [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[LaGuardia Airport|New York\u2013LaGuardia]], [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]], [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix\u2013Sky Harbor]], [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington\u2013National]] | <ref name=\"AmericanRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight schedules and notifications|url=https://www.aa.com/travelInformation/flights/schedule|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202010611/https://www.aa.com/travelInformation/flights/schedule|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] | [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[LaGuardia Airport|New York\u2013LaGuardia]], [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]], [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington\u2013National]] | <ref name=\"AmericanRoutes\" />\n<!-- -->\n| [[Boutique Air]] | [[Mid-Delta Regional Airport|Greenville (MS)]], [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport|Muscle Shoals]] | <ref name=\"BoutiqueRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Route Map and Schedule|url=https://www.boutiqueair.com/p/schedule|website=Boutiqueair.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205023354/https://www.boutiqueair.com/p/schedule|archive-date=December 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[British Airways]] | [[Heathrow Airport|London\u2013Heathrow]] | <ref name=\"BritishRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Timetables|url=https://www.britishairways.com/travel/schedules/public/en_gb|website=Britishairways.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330083400/https://www.britishairways.com/travel/schedules/public/en_gb|archive-date=March 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| {{nowrap|[[Delta Air Lines]]}} | [[Akron\u2013Canton Airport|Akron/Canton]], [[Albany International Airport|Albany (NY)]], [[Albuquerque International Sunport|Albuquerque]], [[Lehigh Valley International Airport|Allentown]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]], [[Appleton International Airport|Appleton]], [[Queen Beatrix International Airport|Aruba]], [[Asheville Regional Airport|Asheville]], [[Augusta Regional Airport|Augusta (GA)]], [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport|Austin]], [[Baltimore\u2013Washington International Airport|Baltimore]], [[Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport|Baton Rouge]], [[Philip S.
