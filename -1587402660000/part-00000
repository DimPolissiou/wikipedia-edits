Du Bois]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nMore recently it has been active on social conservative issues, including [[opposition to same-sex marriage]], [[abortion]], [[divorce]], and [[birth control]], including requiring employers to provide it in violation of their religious beliefs. It has also been critical of the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's immigration policy]], and supportive of immigrants and refugees. Both in the United States and around the world, it has defended [[religious freedom]]. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[Knights of Columbus]] were active politically from an early date. In the years following the [[Second Vatican Council]], however, according to Christopher Kauffman, the Catholic anti-defamation character of the order began to diminish as Catholics became more accepted, and the leadership attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. That led to the creation of a \"variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church\".{{sfn|Kauffman|1982}}\n\nIn December 2018, during the confirmation process of nominee [[Brian C. Buescher]] to the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], \"liberal\" Senator Mazie K. Hirono<ref name=\"Mazie Hirono on the Issues\">{{cite web |title=Mazie Hirono on the Issues |publisher=On the Issues |access-date=November 18, 2018 |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Mazie_Hirono.htm }}]</ref> characterized the position the Knights of Columbus have taken on social issues as \"extreme\" and asked Buescher, \"If confirmed, do you intend to end your membership with this organization to avoid any appearance of bias?\"<ref name=jud>[https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Buescher%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf \"Nomination of Brian Buescher to the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska Questions for the Record December 5, 2018\", Judiciary.senate.gov.]</ref> Senator [[Kamala Harris]] also asked about opinions held by the organization and asked Buescher if he was aware these views when he joined the Knights of Columbus. Buescher replied that he was eighteen years old when he joined and did not recall if the Knights had at that time taken any position on those issues with which the Senator now disagreed.<ref name=jud/>\n\nWriting in the [[Los Angeles Times]], Rabbi Mitchell Rocklin said that the senators approach amounted to a \"religious test\" such as is precluded by Article VI of the Constitution. Rabbi Rocklin said: \"The line of questioning Buescher faced about his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus sets a troubling precedent of intolerance\u2014one that is unconscionable in principle and terrible in practice for people of all faiths who seek a role in public service. ...For centuries, many Jews have suffered a similar 'dual loyalty' smear: the anti-Semitic lie that, faced with a choice between country and religion, a Jewish public official will put his faith before his country.\"<ref name=Rocklin>[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rocklin-brian-buescher-20190116-story.html Rocklin, Mitchell. \"Op-Ed: Keep religious tests out of the Senate\", ''Los Angeles Times'', January 16, 2019]</ref> Micklin noted the anti-Semitism experienced by Justices [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]], and further state, \"It is even more absurd for senators to imply that a judge, who cannot propose or enact legislation, would be incapable of setting aside his religious beliefs when interpreting our written laws. ...If sitting lawmakers are allowed to make such assumptions of Catholic nominees, religious minorities could very well be next.\"<ref name=Rocklin/>\n==History==\n===War and peace issues===\n====World War I====\n[[File:See him through--Help us to help the boys.jpg|thumb|A Knights of Columbus poster from WWI]]\n\nOn April 14, 1917, soon after the United States entered [[World War I]], the board of directors passed a resolution calling \"for the active cooperation and patriotic zeal of 400,000 members of the order in this country to our Republic and its law, pledge their continued and unconditional support to the President and Congress of the Nation, in their determination to protect its honor and its ideals of humanity and right.\"{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=2}}\n\nThe order also instituted a per capita tax on the membership to raise $1 million to provide for the welfare of the troops fighting in Europe.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Local councils undertook their own fundraising drives which resulted in an additional $14 million to support the effort.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Canadian knights took up the cause earlier, reflecting their earlier entry into the conflict.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}} It was said it was their \"finest hour\" as Catholics and as Canadians.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}}\n\nIn 1918, just before the war ended, the Knights joined other organizations in raising funds to support the welfare of the troops both in the United States and overseas, which, along with the contribution of the National Catholic War Council, totaled $30 million.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Staff and chaplains were sent to all Army camps and [[cantonment]]<nowiki/>s.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} A total of 260 buildings were erected and 1,134 secretaries, of which 1,075 were overseas, staffed them.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} In Europe, headquarters were established in London and Paris.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} The order's motto for this effort was \"Everyone welcome, everything free.\"{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}{{sfn|Scott|1919|pp=407\u2013408}} The order continued this work until November 1919, at which point the effort was taken over by the federal government.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} The remaining $19 million was used to establish educational programs for returning servicemen.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}\n\n\n\nAccording to Supreme Knight Flaherty, \"The war provided us with an opportunity to put ourselves before the public in a most favorable light,\"{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=23}} and in Canada to show that in addition to being Catholic, they were also loyal Canadians.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}}\n\n===Cristero War===\nFollowing the [[Mexican Revolution]], the new government began persecuting the church. To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including [[List of Knights of Columbus#Saints|several priests who were also Knights of Columbus]]. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. ''Columbia'', the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of ''Columbia'' portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of \"The Red Peril of Mexico,\" the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.<ref name=\"Pelowski\" />\n\nIn 1926, the Massachusetts State Council passed a resolution opposing the Mexican government and in defense of human rights.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} Ten days later, State Deputy [[Edmund J.

daughters\u2014not much different from yourselves,\" Gomez said.<ref name=\"kris\" />\n\nIn 2013, at the 131st Supreme Convention Archbishop [[Gustavo Garcia-Siller]] of [[San Antonio, Texas]], the site of the convention, quoted Supreme Knight Carl Anderson in saying that the city was special because the city's history of \u201cevangelization, immigration, and the quest for freedom.\u201d<ref name=\"harris\" /> He called on the Knights to bring the light of the [[Gospel]] to the \"desolate places\" such as immigrant detention centers.<ref name=\"harris\" />\n\nAlso at the 2013 convention, Supreme Chaplain [[William Lori]] said that the Knights' mission in regards to immigration is \"definitely growing.\"<ref name=\"harris\" /> He cited their involvement in ''Ecclesia en America,'' a summit held in the Vatican in 2012, as a way they protect, love and help immigrants.<ref name=\"harris\" /> The Knights see the issue, according to Lori, as \"a partnership of the North and South Church.\"<ref name=\"harris\" /> He said the order was working to enact \"immigration laws that are truly just, and truly merciful.\"<ref name=\"harris\" />\n\nAt the 2017 convention, Cardinal [[Daniel DiNardo]] of Galveston-Houston, president of the U.S. bishops\u2019 conference, said that Christ teaches that \"there is no more boundary when it comes to 'who are you neighbor to?'\"<ref

/>\n\n===Resolutions===\nOn 9 April 2006 the board of directors commented on the \"[[United States immigration debate|U.S. immigration policy]] [which] has become an intensely debated and divisive issue on both sides of the border between the U.S. and Mexico.\"<ref name=\"immigration\" /><ref name=\"eyes\" /> They called\n\n{{quote|upon the President and the U.S. Congress to agree upon

/>}}\n\nAt the 136th Supreme Convention in 2018, the order adopted a resolution criticizing the [[Trump administration family separation policy]].<ref name=\"trump\" /> The Supreme Council called on the administration to \"equitably balance the legitimate rights of persons to emigrate in order to seek better lives for themselves and their children, with the duty of governments to control migration into their countries so that immigration policy serves the common good.\"<ref name=\"trump\" />\n\n===Refugees===\nAt the request of the [[Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America]], Supreme Knight Martin Carmody wrote to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1938 to support Jewish refugees seeking refuge in Palestine.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=335}} During the 2008 [[International Eucharistic Congress]], a donation was made to Cardinal [[Marc Ouellet]]'s foundation to support long-term programs to aid immigrants and refugees.<ref name=\"iec\" />\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada, Knights promoted the idea that being a good Catholic was being a good Canadian, and they helped immigrants assimilate.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=178}} In the years prior to World War I, Canadians Knights established an immigrant aid bureau.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=178}} After the war, and with the Catholic Women's League, they promoted a \"Canadianization of the Newcomer\" program.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=178}}\n\n==Cultural issues==\n===Marriage and family life===\nAs part of their public policy efforts, the Knights of Columbus \"promotes the dignity and the irreplaceable value of the family founded on the Church's understanding of marriage as the faithful, exclusive, and lifelong union of one man and one woman joined in an intimate partnership of life and love.\"<ref name=\"policy\" />\n\nSince 2005, the Knights have given at least $14&nbsp;million to legally define marriage as the union of one man and one woman in the United States.<ref name=\"financial\" /> In 2008, they were the largest single donor in support of California's [[Proposition 8]].<ref name=\"advocate\" /> In 2012, the Knights and its local councils contributed $1&nbsp;million to support similar ballot campaigns in Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, and Washington. In Massachusetts it led the drive to collect the 170,000 petition signatures to amend the Massachusetts Constitution to include this definition.<ref name=\"darrin\" /> In a 2005 attempt to stop the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]] from legalizing same-sex marriage with the ''[[Civil Marriage Act]]'', the order funded a campaign that included 800,000 postcards encouraging members of parliament to reject the measure.<ref name=\"postcard\" />\n\nThe order also supports the church's teaching on divorce,<ref name=\"louis\" /><ref name=\"francis\" />{{sfnm |1a1=Bauernschub |1y=1949 |1pp=62\u201363 |2a1=Kauffman |2y=1982 |2pp=228, 400}} and the Supreme Council gave their \"strong support\" to a 1976 address by Bishop [[Daniel A.

It encompasses opposition to a number of [[bioethics|bio-ethical]] practices that are destructive of human life, including [[physician assisted suicide]], [[embryonic stem cell research]], and [[abortion]],<ref name=\"barry\" /> and the promotion of policies that \"lift up the human spirit with compassion and love.\"<ref name=\"leonard\" />   The term was made popular by [[Pope John Paul II]].|name=|group=}} the Knights oppose any governmental action or policy that promotes [[abortion]], [[embryonic stem cell research]], [[human cloning]], [[euthanasia]], [[assisted suicide]], [[Just war theory|unjust wars]], the [[death penalty]], or other things they consider offenses against life.<ref name=\"gift\" /><ref name=\"culturelife\" /><ref name=\"regalia2\" /><ref name=\"coflife\" /> In their document \"Building A Culture of Life,\" they state that those \"who do not support the legal protection of unborn children, or who advocate the legalization of assisted suicide or euthanasia\" cannot be invited to Knights of Columbus events, or have honors bestowed upon them.<ref name=\"regalia2\" />\n\nThe Knights consistently donate to [[pro-life]] causes. As part of their Ultrasound Initiative in the United States and Canada, 1,000 ultrasound machines were donated to pregnancy centers between 2009 and 2018,<ref name=\"lives\" /><ref name=\"uic\" /><ref name=\"ultra\" /><ref name=\"regalia2\" /> centers which otherwise would not be likely to afford them.<ref name=\"culturelife\" /> Research shows that women are less likely to obtain an abortion after seeing ultrasound images, particularly as the child's gestational age increases.<ref name=\"cali\" /><ref name=\"lives\" /> The order also supports women in crisis pregnancies with alternatives to abortion, including adoption.<ref name=\"culturelife\" />\n\nOn another \"life\" issue, following a series of violent mass murders they produced a resolution calling for national healing and reconciliation after the [[Orlando nightclub shooting|Pulse nightclub massacre]] and [[2015 San Bernardino attack]].<ref name=\"healing\" /><ref name=\"fournier\" />\n\n==Domestic policy==\nDuring the early part of the 20th century, both the Supreme and local councils found themselves in agreement with the principles of the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive movement]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=166}} Senator [[Albert J. Beveridge]], an intellectual leader of the Progressive movement, was the featured speaker at \"a grand patriotic demonstration\" at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1906, and [[James C. Monaghan]], the Supreme Lecturer, frequently spoke out in favor of progressive causes in ''Columbiad'' and elsewhere.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=166}} The Massachusetts State Council was supportive of [[New Deal]] policies in 1933.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=43}}\n\nIn the 1980s, the Knights supported an amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] permitting prayer in public school.<ref name=\"right\" /> \nWhen president [[Ronald Reagan]] attempted to tax fraternal insurance companies such as the Knights of Columbus, then\u2013Supreme Knight [[Virgil Dechant]] used White House connections to scuttle the effort.<ref name=\"franklin\" /> In addition, local councils set up phone banks and letter writing campaigns to oppose the measure, which would have diminished the Knights' ability to make charitable contributions.<ref name=\"franklin\" />\n\n===Pledge of Allegiance===\nThe Knights led in adding the phrase \"under God\" to the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], in 1951.<ref name=\"newsweek\" /><ref name=\"canipe\" /> They used it in their assemblies and successfully lobbied Congress to make the change.<ref name=\"under\" /><ref name=\"jones\" /> [[President Eisenhower]], after signing the change into law in 1954, thanked the Knights for their efforts.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=385}} \n\nIn 2014 when the [[American Humanist Association]] sued to reverse the decision, lawyers from the Knights and other organizations successfully supported schools that used the phrase in the pledge.<ref name=\"hopkins\" />\n\n===Promoting Christopher Columbus===\nAt the behest of the Knights, Congress appropriated $100,000 to construct the [[Columbus Fountain]] in front of [[Washington Union Station|Union Station]] in Washington, DC, in 1912.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=162}}<ref name=\"59th Congress\" /> The Supreme Knight was made a member of the committee to erect it.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=162}}<ref name=\"59th Congress\" />\n\nSimilar lobbying convinced many [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] to adopt October 12 as [[Columbus Day]], and led to President Franklin D.

concerns any involvement of the [[Knights of Columbus]], a Catholic [[fraternal and service organizations|fraternal service organization]], to try to influence public and government policy.\n\nDuring the 20th century and especially the [[Cold War]], the order had a history of  [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] and anti-socialist crusades.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=364\u2013365}} It also established the Commission on Religious Prejudices and the Knights of Columbus Historical Commission to combat racism.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}} It was supportive of [[trade unionism]] and published the works of men including [[George Ernest Schuster|George Schuster]], [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]], [[Allan Nevins]], and [[W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nMore recently it has been active on social conservative issues, including [[opposition to same-sex marriage]], [[abortion]], [[divorce]], and [[birth control]], including requiring employers to provide it in violation of their religious beliefs. It has also been critical of the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's immigration policy]], and supportive of immigrants and refugees. Both in the United States and around the world, it has defended [[religious freedom]]. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[Knights of Columbus]] were active politically from an early date. In the years following the [[Second Vatican Council]], however, according to Christopher Kauffman, the Catholic anti-defamation character of the order began to diminish as Catholics became more accepted, and the leadership attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. That led to the creation of a \"variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church\".{{sfn|Kauffman|1982}}\n\nIn December 2018, during the confirmation process of nominee [[Brian C. Buescher]] to the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], \"liberal\" Senator Mazie K. Hirono<ref name=\"Mazie Hirono on the Issues\">{{cite web |title=Mazie Hirono on the Issues |publisher=On the Issues |access-date=November 18, 2018 |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Mazie_Hirono.htm }}]</ref> characterized the position the Knights of Columbus have taken on social issues as \"extreme\" and asked Buescher, \"If confirmed, do you intend to end your membership with this organization to avoid any appearance of bias?\"<ref name=jud>[https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Buescher%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf \"Nomination of Brian Buescher to the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska Questions for the Record December 5, 2018\", Judiciary.senate.gov.]</ref> Senator [[Kamala Harris]] also asked about opinions held by the organization and asked Buescher if he was aware these views when he joined the Knights of Columbus. Buescher replied that he was eighteen years old when he joined and did not recall if the Knights had at that time taken any position on those issues with which the Senator now disagreed.<ref name=jud/>\n\nWriting in the [[Los Angeles Times]], Rabbi Mitchell Rocklin said that the senators approach amounted to a \"religious test\" such as is precluded by Article VI of the Constitution. Rabbi Rocklin said: \"The line of questioning Buescher faced about his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus sets a troubling precedent of intolerance\u2014one that is unconscionable in principle and terrible in practice for people of all faiths who seek a role in public service. ...For centuries, many Jews have suffered a similar 'dual loyalty' smear: the anti-Semitic lie that, faced with a choice between country and religion, a Jewish public official will put his faith before his country.\"<ref name=Rocklin>[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rocklin-brian-buescher-20190116-story.html Rocklin, Mitchell. \"Op-Ed: Keep religious tests out of the Senate\", ''Los Angeles Times'', January 16, 2019]</ref> Micklin noted the anti-Semitism experienced by Justices [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]], and further state, \"It is even more absurd for senators to imply that a judge, who cannot propose or enact legislation, would be incapable of setting aside his religious beliefs when interpreting our written laws. ...If sitting lawmakers are allowed to make such assumptions of Catholic nominees, religious minorities could very well be next.\"<ref name=Rocklin/>\n==History==\n===War and peace issues===\n====World War I====\n[[File:See him through--Help us to help the boys.jpg|thumb|A Knights of Columbus poster from WWI]]\n\nOn April 14, 1917, soon after the United States entered [[World War I]], the board of directors passed a resolution calling \"for the active cooperation and patriotic zeal of 400,000 members of the order in this country to our Republic and its law, pledge their continued and unconditional support to the President and Congress of the Nation, in their determination to protect its honor and its ideals of humanity and right.\"{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=2}}\n\nThe order also instituted a per capita tax on the membership to raise $1 million to provide for the welfare of the troops fighting in Europe.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Local councils undertook their own fundraising drives which resulted in an additional $14 million to support the effort.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Canadian knights took up the cause earlier, reflecting their earlier entry into the conflict.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}} It was said it was their \"finest hour\" as Catholics and as Canadians.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}}\n\nIn 1918, just before the war ended, the Knights joined other organizations in raising funds to support the welfare of the troops both in the United States and overseas, which, along with the contribution of the National Catholic War Council, totaled $30 million.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Staff and chaplains were sent to all Army camps and [[cantonment]]<nowiki/>s.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} A total of 260 buildings were erected and 1,134 secretaries, of which 1,075 were overseas, staffed them.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} In Europe, headquarters were established in London and Paris.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} The order's motto for this effort was \"Everyone welcome, everything free.\"{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}{{sfn|Scott|1919|pp=407\u2013408}} The order continued this work until November 1919, at which point the effort was taken over by the federal government.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} The remaining $19 million was used to establish educational programs for returning servicemen.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}\n\n\n\nAccording to Supreme Knight Flaherty, \"The war provided us with an opportunity to put ourselves before the public in a most favorable light,\"{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=23}} and in Canada to show that in addition to being Catholic, they were also loyal Canadians.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}}\n\n===Cristero War===\nFollowing the [[Mexican Revolution]], the new government began persecuting the church. To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including [[List of Knights of Columbus#Saints|several priests who were also Knights of Columbus]]. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. ''Columbia'', the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of ''Columbia'' portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of \"The Red Peril of Mexico,\" the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.<ref name=\"Pelowski\" />\n\nIn 1926, the Massachusetts State Council passed a resolution opposing the Mexican government and in defense of human rights.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} Ten days later, State Deputy [[Edmund J. Brandon]] sent a telegram to President [[Calvin Coolidge]] and Secretary of State [[Frank B. Kellogg]] opposing the deportation of a Mexican archbishop.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} That same year, a delegation of Supreme Council officers met with President Coolidge to share with him their concerns about the persecution of Catholics in Mexico.\n\nThe order subsequently smuggled into Mexico pamphlets in English and Spanish denouncing the anticlerical Mexican government and its policies,<ref name=\"legacy\" /> provoking efforts at the border to stop the flow.{{sfn|Young|2015|pp=108\u2013109}}<ref name=\"king\" /> Twenty-five [[Saints of the Cristero War|martyrs from the conflict]] would eventually be canonized, including six Knights.<ref name=\"martyr\" />{{sfn|Meyer|1976}}\n\nSupreme Treasurer Daniel J.

Borah]] to launch an investigation in 1935 into human rights violations in Mexico.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=301\u2013302}} Pope [[Pius XI]] in his encyclical ''[[Iniquis afflictisque]]'' praised the Knights' efforts.<ref name=\"columbia\" />\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\nDuring the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Church in America supported General [[Francisco Franco]] and the other rebels.{{sfn|Crosby|p=95|1971}} The Knights, and other Catholic groups, took the same stance.{{sfn|Crosby|p=95|1971}} When a group of American intellectuals formed the Board of Guardians for Basque Refugee Children and proposed shipping children from Spain to the United States, the Knights with others opposed the plan.{{sfn|Crosby|p=97|1971}} They appealed to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to keep the children with their families in France, though they were ready to assist those coming to the United States.{{sfn|Crosby|p=97|1971}}\n\nThe Knights supported the embargo on all arms into Spain,<ref name=\"Tierney2007\" /> and appealed to  [[Will H.

The Knights called the tendency to set up a caste system based on when your ancestors arrived in the country \"a travesty of democracy.\"{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=31}} James Malone, then Kansas State Deputy, railed against bigots who claimed that immigrants and Catholics were inferior to native born Americans and protestants.{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=32}} \n\nThen in 2016 the Knights provided funding to the dioceses of [[Diocese of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez|Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of El Paso|El Paso]] to facilitate [[Pope Francis]]' [[List of pastoral visits of Pope Francis#2016|visit to the US-Mexican border]] which highlighted \"the plight of migrants and the determination of the Church in the United States and Mexico to work ... for just immigration

people|Vietnamese]] council in Toronto.<ref name=\"arab\" /> Many state councils have multicultural or diversity committees whose mission it is to support immigrant knights who do not speak the local language.<ref name=\"arab\" />\n\n===Conventions===\nAt the Knights' 129th Supreme Convention in 2011, Archbishop [[Jos\u00e9 Horacio G\u00f3mez|Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez]] criticized the United States' immigration policy as not being \"worthy of our national character.\"<ref name=\"kris\" /> He told the delegates to approach the immigration issue as Catholics, not as Democrats or Republicans, liberals or conservatives.<ref name=\"kris\" /> \"Our perspective on this issue will change if you begin to see these 'illegals' for who they really are\u2014mothers and fathers, sons and daughters\u2014not much different from yourselves,\" Gomez said.<ref name=\"kris\" />\n\nIn 2013, at the 131st Supreme Convention Archbishop [[Gustavo Garcia-Siller]] of [[San Antonio, Texas]], the site of the convention, quoted Supreme Knight Carl Anderson in saying that the city was special because the city's history of \u201cevangelization, immigration, and the quest for freedom.\u201d<ref name=\"harris\" /> He called on the Knights to bring the light of the [[Gospel]] to the \"desolate places\" such as immigrant detention centers.<ref name=\"harris\" />\n\nAlso at the 2013 convention, Supreme Chaplain [[William Lori]] said that the Knights' mission in regards to immigration is \"definitely growing.\"<ref name=\"harris\" /> He cited their involvement in ''Ecclesia en America,'' a summit held in the Vatican in 2012, as a way they protect, love and help immigrants.<ref name=\"harris\" /> The Knights see the issue, according to Lori, as \"a partnership of the North and South Church.\"<ref name=\"harris\" /> He said the order was working to enact \"immigration laws that are truly just, and truly merciful.\"<ref name=\"harris\" />\n\nAt the 2017 convention, Cardinal [[Daniel DiNardo]] of Galveston-Houston, president of the U.S. bishops\u2019 conference, said that Christ teaches that \"there is no more boundary when it comes to 'who are you neighbor to?'\"<ref name=\"missionary\" /> DiNardo added that the Knights live this teaching by helping anyone in need, including immigrants, refugees, and Christians displaced from their homes.<ref name=\"missionary\" />\n\n===Resolutions===\nOn 9 April 2006 the board of directors commented on the \"[[United States immigration debate|U.S. immigration policy]] [which] has become an intensely debated and divisive issue on both sides of the border between the U.S. and Mexico.\"<ref name=\"immigration\" /><ref name=\"eyes\" /> They called\n\n{{quote|upon the President and the U.S. Congress to agree upon immigration legislation that not only gains control over the process of immigration, but also rejects any effort to criminalize those who provide humanitarian assistance to illegal immigrants, and provides these immigrants an avenue by which they can emerge from the shadows of society and seek legal [[Permanent residency|residency]] and citizenship in the U.S.<ref name=\"immigration\" />}}\n\nAt the 136th Supreme Convention in 2018, the order adopted a resolution criticizing the [[Trump administration family separation policy]].<ref name=\"trump\" /> The Supreme Council called on the administration to \"equitably balance the legitimate rights of persons to emigrate in order to seek better lives for themselves and their children, with the duty of governments to control migration into their countries so that immigration policy serves the common good.\"<ref name=\"trump\" />\n\n===Refugees===\nAt the request of the [[Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America]], Supreme Knight Martin Carmody wrote to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1938 to support Jewish refugees seeking refuge in Palestine.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=335}} During the 2008 [[International Eucharistic Congress]], a donation was made to Cardinal [[Marc Ouellet]]'s foundation to support long-term programs to aid immigrants and refugees.<ref name=\"iec\" />\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada, Knights promoted the idea that being a good Catholic was being a good Canadian, and they helped immigrants assimilate.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=178}} In the years prior to World War I, Canadians Knights established an immigrant aid bureau.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=178}} After the war, and with the Catholic Women's League, they promoted a \"Canadianization of the Newcomer\" program.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=178}}\n\n==Cultural issues==\n===Marriage and family life===\nAs part of their public policy efforts, the Knights of Columbus \"promotes the dignity and the irreplaceable value of the family founded on the Church's understanding of marriage as the faithful, exclusive, and lifelong union of one man and one woman joined in an intimate partnership of life and love.\"<ref name=\"policy\" />\n\nSince 2005, the Knights have given at least $14&nbsp;million to legally define marriage as the union of one man and one woman in the United States.<ref name=\"financial\" /> In 2008, they were the largest single donor in support of California's [[Proposition 8]].<ref name=\"advocate\" /> In 2012, the Knights and its local councils contributed $1&nbsp;million to support similar ballot campaigns in Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, and Washington. In Massachusetts it led the drive to collect the 170,000 petition signatures to amend the Massachusetts Constitution to include this definition.<ref name=\"darrin\" /> In a 2005 attempt to stop the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]] from legalizing same-sex marriage with the ''[[Civil Marriage Act]]'', the order funded a campaign that included 800,000 postcards encouraging members of parliament to reject the measure.<ref name=\"postcard\" />\n\nThe order also supports the church's teaching on divorce,<ref name=\"louis\" /><ref name=\"francis\" />{{sfnm |1a1=Bauernschub |1y=1949 |1pp=62\u201363 |2a1=Kauffman |2y=1982 |2pp=228, 400}} and the Supreme Council gave their \"strong support\" to a 1976 address by Bishop [[Daniel A. Cronin]] in which he denounced the \"increasing practice of divorce.\"<ref name=\"cronin\" /> The order has a number of initiatives to support and strengthen families as part of their Building the Domestic Church program<ref name=\"bdc\" /><ref name=\"dc\" /> and sponsors Fathers for Good, an initiative to support men \"in becoming the best fathers they can be.\"<ref name=\"ffg\" /> The promotion of fatherhood and marital harmony dates back to the founding era of the order.{{sfn|Koehlinger|2004}}\n\n===Culture of life===\nAs part of their commitment to building a [[culture of life]],{{efn|\"More than a rhetorical flourish,\"<ref name=\"barry\" /> the phrase \"culture of life\" refers the belief that human life at all stages from conception through natural death is sacred, and in practice has emphasized birth and death issues.  It encompasses opposition to a number of [[bioethics|bio-ethical]] practices that are destructive of human life, including [[physician assisted suicide]], [[embryonic stem cell research]], and [[abortion]],<ref name=\"barry\" /> and the promotion of policies that \"lift up the human spirit with compassion and love.\"<ref name=\"leonard\" />   The term was made popular by [[Pope John Paul II]].|name=|group=}} the Knights oppose any governmental action or policy that promotes [[abortion]], [[embryonic stem cell research]], [[human cloning]], [[euthanasia]], [[assisted suicide]], [[Just war theory|unjust wars]], the [[death penalty]], or other things they consider offenses against life.<ref name=\"gift\" /><ref name=\"culturelife\" /><ref name=\"regalia2\" /><ref name=\"coflife\" /> In their document \"Building A Culture of Life,\" they state that those \"who do not support the legal protection of unborn children, or who advocate the legalization of assisted suicide or euthanasia\" cannot be invited to Knights of Columbus events, or have honors bestowed upon them.<ref name=\"regalia2\" />\n\nThe Knights consistently donate to [[pro-life]] causes. As part of their Ultrasound Initiative in the United States and Canada, 1,000 ultrasound machines were donated to pregnancy centers between 2009 and 2018,<ref name=\"lives\" /><ref name=\"uic\" /><ref name=\"ultra\" /><ref name=\"regalia2\" /> centers which otherwise would not be likely to afford them.<ref name=\"culturelife\" /> Research shows that women are less likely to obtain an abortion after seeing ultrasound images, particularly as the child's gestational age increases.<ref name=\"cali\" /><ref name=\"lives\" /> The order also supports women in crisis pregnancies with alternatives to abortion, including adoption.<ref name=\"culturelife\" />\n\nOn another \"life\" issue, following a series of violent mass murders they produced a resolution calling for national healing and reconciliation after the [[Orlando nightclub shooting|Pulse nightclub massacre]] and [[2015 San Bernardino attack]].<ref name=\"healing\" /><ref name=\"fournier\" />\n\n==Domestic policy==\nDuring the early part of the 20th century, both the Supreme and local councils found themselves in agreement with the principles of the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive movement]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=166}} Senator [[Albert J. Beveridge]], an intellectual leader of the Progressive movement, was the featured speaker at \"a grand patriotic demonstration\" at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1906, and [[James C. Monaghan]], the Supreme Lecturer, frequently spoke out in favor of progressive causes in ''Columbiad'' and elsewhere.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=166}} The Massachusetts State Council was supportive of [[New Deal]] policies in 1933.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=43}}\n\nIn the 1980s, the Knights supported an amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] permitting prayer in public school.<ref name=\"right\" /> \nWhen president [[Ronald Reagan]] attempted to tax fraternal insurance companies such as the Knights of Columbus, then\u2013Supreme Knight [[Virgil Dechant]] used White House connections to scuttle the effort.<ref name=\"franklin\" /> In addition, local councils set up phone banks and letter writing campaigns to oppose the measure, which would have diminished the Knights' ability to make charitable contributions.<ref name=\"franklin\" />\n\n===Pledge of Allegiance===\nThe Knights led in adding the phrase \"under God\" to the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], in 1951.<ref name=\"under\" />{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=385}}<ref name=\"newsweek\" /><ref name=\"canipe\" /> They used it in their assemblies and began lobbying Congress to make the change.<ref name=\"under\" />{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=385}}<ref name=\"jones\" /> At the urging of five state councils, the Supreme Council adopted a resolution in 1952 encouraging Congress to officially insert the words into the pledge.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=385}} [[President Eisenhower]], after signing the change into law in 1954, thanked the Knights for their efforts to get the phrase added.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=385}} \n\nIn 2014 when the [[American Humanist Association]] sued to reverse the decision, lawyers from the Knights and other organizations successfully supported schools that used the phrase in the pledge.<ref name=\"hopkins\" />\n\n===Promoting Christopher Columbus===\nAt the behest of the Knights, Congress appropriated $100,000 to construct the [[Columbus Fountain]] in front of [[Washington Union Station|Union Station]] in Washington, DC, in 1912.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=162}}<ref name=\"59th Congress\" /> The Supreme Knight was made a member of the committee to erect it.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=162}}<ref name=\"59th Congress\" />\n\nSimilar lobbying convinced many [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] to adopt October 12 as [[Columbus Day]], and led to President Franklin D.

She was the mother of ten children who survived to adulthood, including two kings, [[William II of England|William II]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry I]].\n\nIn 1031, Matilda was born into the royal family of Flanders. the second daughter of Baldwin V, Sovereign Count of Flanders and Adele of France. The Sovereign Counts of Flanders were a small hereditary monarchy of the independent o sovereign county named Flanders. They chose to use the style Counts by the Grace of God of Flanders. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Jan|first=R\u00e9gine Le|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=v8vwhSwhWogC&dq=gratia+dei+bilbao&q=gratia+dei+#v=snippet&q=gratia%20dei&f=false|title=Famille et pouvoir dans le monde franc (VIIe-Xe si\u00e8cle): essai d'anthropologie sociale|last2=LeJan|first2=R\u00e9gine|date=1995|publisher=Publications de la Sorbonne|isbn=978-2-85944-268-2|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nFlanders was of strategic importance to England and most of Europe as a \"stepping stone between England and the Continent\" necessary for strategic trade and for keeping the Scandinavian Intruders from England. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Oksanen|first=Eljas|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=XXHF0nxMBdkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Baldwin+was+the+co-regent+with+Anne+of+Kiev+for+his+nephew+Philip+I+of+France,&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjPxICSn-boAhUoU98KHf1ADywQ6AEICzAB#v=onepage&q=stepping&f=false|title=Flanders and the Anglo-Norman World, 1066-1216|date=2012-09-13|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76099-7|language=en}}</ref>\n  \nIn addition her mother was the daughter of the King of France. For these reasons Matildalda was of grander birth than William, who was illegitimate, and, according to some suspiciously romantic tales, she initially refused his proposal on this account. Her descent from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] royal [[House of Wessex]] was also to become a useful card. Like many royal marriages of the period, it breached the rules of [[consanguinity]], then at their most restrictive (to seven generations or degrees of relatedness); Matilda and William were third-cousins, once removed. She was about 20 when they married in 1051/2; William was some four years older, and had been [[Duke of Normandy]] since he was about eight (in 1035).\n\nThe marriage appears to have been successful, and William is not recorded to have had any bastards. Matilda was about 35, and had already borne most of her children, when William embarked on the [[Norman conquest of England]], sailing in his flagship ''[[Mora (ship)|Mora]]'', which Matilda had given him.  She governed the [[Duchy of Normandy]] in his absence, joining him in England only after more than a year, and subsequently returning to Normandy, where she spent most of the remainder of her life, while William was mostly in his new kingdom.  She was about 52 when she died in Normandy in 1083.\n\nApart from governing Normandy and supporting her brother's interests in Flanders, Matilda took a close interest in the education of her children, who were unusually well educated for contemporary royalty. The boys were tutored by the Italian [[Lanfranc]], who was made [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1070, while the girls learned Latin in [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen|Sainte-Trinit\u00e9 Abbey]] in [[Caen]], founded by William and Matilda as part of the papal [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] allowing their marriage.\n\n==Marriage==\nMatilda, or Maud, was the daughter of [[Baldwin V, Count of Flanders]], and [[Adela of France, Countess of Flanders|Adela]], herself daughter of King [[Robert II of France]].{{sfn|Schwennicke|1984|loc=Tafeln 5, 11, 81}}\n\nAccording to legend, when the Norman duke [[William the Bastard]] (later called ''the Conqueror'') sent his representative to ask for Matilda's hand in marriage, she told the representative that she was far too high-born to consider marrying a [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Matilda's principal attribute was her descent from [[Charlemagne]] and her many royal ancestors, her closest being her grandfather Robert II of France. She was the niece of King [[Henry I of France]], William's suzerain, and at his death in 1060, first cousin to his successor King [[Philip I of France]]. A member of the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] she was closely related to most of the royal families of Europe. A marriage to a member of the (Carolingian) royal family was a means of upward mobility for a soldier or [[Nobility|nobleman]] like William. Her descent from [[Alfred the Great]] (whose daughter [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]] was the mother of [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders]], and great-great-great-great-grandmother of Matilda) also proved a legitimizing factor as queen of England. See {{harvnb|Hilton|2010|p=17}}, {{harvnb|Le Jan|2000|p=56|loc=Notes 14, 57}}, {{harvnb|Wareham|2005|p=3}}</ref> After hearing this response, William rode from Normandy to [[Bruges]], found Matilda on her way to church, dragged her off her horse by her long [[braid]]s, threw her down in the street in front of her flabbergasted attendants and rode off.\n\nAnother version of the story states that William rode to Matilda's father's house in [[Lille]], threw her to the ground in her room (again, by her braids) and hit her (or violently battered her) before leaving. Naturally, Baldwin took offence at this; but, before they could [[Duel|draw swords]], Matilda settled the matter{{sfn|Hilliam|2004|p=20}} by refusing to marry anyone but William;{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=17}} even a papal ban by [[Pope Leo IX]] at the [[Council of Reims]] on the grounds of [[consanguinity]] did not dissuade her. William and Matilda were married after a delay in {{circa|1051\u20132}}.{{sfn|Keats-Rohan|1999|p=495}} A papal [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] was finally awarded in 1059 by [[Pope Nicholas II]].{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p= 18}} Lanfranc, at the time prior of [[Bec Abbey]], negotiated the arrangement in Rome and it came only after William and Matilda agreed to found two churches as penance.{{sfn|Bates|1982|p=199}}\n\n==Rumored romances==\nThere were rumours that Matilda had been in love variously with the English ambassador to [[Flanders]] and with the great [[Saxon]] [[thegn]] [[Brictric son of Algar|Brictric, son of Algar]], who (according to the account by the ''Continuator of [[Wace]]'' and others{{sfn|Thorn|Thorn|Morris|1985|loc=Part 2 (notes), 24,21, quoting {{harvnb|Freeman|1871|loc=Appendix, note 0}} }}) in his youth declined her advances.  Whatever the truth of the matter, years later when she was acting as [[regent]] for her husband William in England, she is said to have used her authority to confiscate Brictric's lands and throw him into prison, where he died.{{sfn|Freeman|1871|pp=761-764}}\n\n==Duchess of Normandy==\nWhen William was preparing to invade England, Matilda outfitted a ship, the ''[[Mora (ship)|Mora]]'', out of her own funds and gave it to him.{{sfn|van Houts|1988|p=166}} Additionally, William gave [[Normandy]] to his wife during his absence. Matilda successfully guided the duchy through this period in the name of her fourteen-year-old son; no major uprisings or unrest occurred.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|pp= 31\u201332}}\n\nEven after William conquered England and became its king, it took her more than a year to visit the kingdom.{{sfn|Huneycutt|2003|p=50}} Despite having been crowned queen, she spent most of her time in Normandy, governing the duchy, supporting her brother's interests in Flanders, and sponsoring ecclesiastic houses there. Only one of her children was born in England; [[Henry I of England|Henry]] was born in Yorkshire when Matilda accompanied her husband in the [[Harrying of the North]].{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=35}}\n\n==Queen==\n[[File:Luxembourg - La Reine Mathilde.jpg|thumb|right|250px|{{Center|Statue of Matilda of Flanders, one of the twenty [[Reines de France et Femmes illustres]] in the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]], Paris, by Carle Elshoecht (1850)}}]]\n[[File:Queen Matilda's grave in the Women's Abbey at Caen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tomb of Matilda of Flanders at [[Abbaye aux Dames]], Caen]]\n[[File:Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne interior (2).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tomb of William of Normandy at [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]], Caen]]\nMatilda was crowned queen on 11 May 1068 in [[Westminster]] during the feast of [[Pentecost]], in a ceremony presided over by the [[Ealdred (bishop)|archbishop of York]]. Three new phrases were incorporated to cement the importance of queens, stating that they were divinely placed by God, shared in royal power, and blessed her people by her power and virtue.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p= 33}}{{sfn|Huneycutt|2003|p=51}}\n\nFor many years it was thought that she had some involvement in the creation of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (commonly called ''La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde'' in French), but historians no longer believe that; it seems to have been commissioned by William's half-brother [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]], and made by English artists in [[Kent]].{{sfn|Norton|2001|p=3}}\n\nMatilda bore William nine or ten children. He was believed to have been faithful to her and never produced a child outside their marriage. Despite her royal duties, Matilda was deeply invested in her children's well-being. All were known for being remarkably educated. Her daughters were educated and taught to read Latin at [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen|Sainte-Trinit\u00e9]] in [[Caen]] founded by Matilda and William in response to the recognition of their marriage.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=29}} For her sons, she secured [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] of whom she was an ardent supporter. Both she and William approved of the Archbishop's desire to revitalise the Church.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=37}}\n\nShe stood as godmother for [[Matilda of Scotland]], who would become Queen of England after marrying Matilda's son [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. During the christening, the baby pulled Queen Matilda's headdress down on top of herself, which was seen as an omen that the younger Matilda would be queen some day as well.{{sfn|Huneycutt|2003|p=10}}\n\nMatilda fell ill during the summer of 1083 and died in November 1083. Her husband was present for her final confession.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=39}} William died four years later in 1087.\n\nContrary to the common belief that she was buried at St. Stephen's, also called l'[[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]] in [[Caen]], Normandy, where William was eventually buried, she is entombed in Caen at l'[[Abbaye aux Dames]], which is the community of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9. Of particular interest is the 11th-century slab, a sleek black stone decorated with her epitaph, marking her grave at the rear of the church. In contrast, the grave marker for William's tomb was replaced as recently as the beginning of the 19th century.\n\n==Height==\n\nOver time Matilda's tomb was desecrated and her original coffin destroyed. Her remains were placed in a sealed box and reburied under the original black slab.{{sfn|Dewhurst|1981|pp=271\u2013272}} In 1959 Matilda's incomplete skeleton was examined and her femur and tibia were measured to determine her height using anthropometric methods. Her height was {{convert|5|ft|cm|0}}, a normal female height for the time.{{sfn|Dewhurst|1981|pp=271\u2013272}} However, as a result of this examination she was misreported as being {{convert|4|ft|2|in|cm}}{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=370}} leading to the [[myth]] that she was extremely small.\n\n==Family and children==\nMatilda and William had four sons and at least five daughters.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=393}} The birth order of the boys is clear, but no source gives the relative order of birth of the daughters.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=393}}\n\n# [[Robert Curthose|Robert]], born between 1051 and 1054, died 10 February 1134.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=394}} Duke of Normandy, married [[Sybil of Conversano]], daughter of [[Geoffrey of Conversano]].{{sfn|Thompson|2004}}\n# [[Richard, Duke of Bernay|Richard]], born c. 1054, died around 1075.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=394}}\n# [[William II of England|William Rufus]], born between 1056 and 1060, died 2 August 1100.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=394}} King of England, killed in the New Forest.\n# [[Henry I of England|Henry]], born late 1068, died 1 December 1135.{{sfn|Douglas|1964|p=394}} King of England, married [[Edith of Scotland]], daughter of [[Malcolm III of Scotland]].

Her descent from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] royal [[House of Wessex]] was also to become a useful card. Like many royal marriages of the period, it breached the rules of [[consanguinity]], then at their most restrictive (to seven generations or degrees of relatedness); Matilda and William were third-cousins, once removed. She was about 20 when they married in 1051/2; William was some four years older, and had been [[Duke of Normandy]] since he was about eight (in 1035).  \n\nThe marriage appears to have been successful, and William is not recorded to have had any bastards. Matilda was about 35, and had already borne most of her children, when William embarked on the [[Norman conquest of England]], sailing in his flagship ''[[Mora (ship)|Mora]]'', which Matilda had given him.  She governed the [[Duchy of Normandy]] in his absence, joining him in England only after more than a year, and subsequently returning to Normandy, where she spent most of the remainder of her life, while William was mostly in his new kingdom.  She was about 52 when she died in Normandy in 1083.\n\nApart from governing Normandy and supporting her brother's interests in Flanders, Matilda took a close interest in the education of her children, who were unusually well educated for contemporary royalty. The boys were tutored by the Italian [[Lanfranc]], who was made [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1070, while the girls learned Latin in [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen|Sainte-Trinit\u00e9 Abbey]] in [[Caen]], founded by William and Matilda as part of the papal [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] allowing their marriage.\n\n==Marriage==\nMatilda, or Maud, was the daughter of [[Baldwin V, Count of Flanders]], and [[Adela of France, Countess of Flanders|Adela]], herself daughter of King [[Robert II of France]].{{sfn|Schwennicke|1984|loc=Tafeln 5, 11, 81}}\n\nAccording to legend, when the Norman duke [[William the Bastard]] (later called ''the Conqueror'') sent his representative to ask for Matilda's hand in marriage, she told the representative that she was far too high-born to consider marrying a [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Matilda's principal attribute was her descent from [[Charlemagne]] and her many royal ancestors, her closest being her grandfather Robert II of France. She was the niece of King [[Henry I of France]], William's suzerain, and at his death in 1060, first cousin to his successor King [[Philip I of France]]. A member of the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] she was closely related to most of the royal families of Europe. A marriage to a member of the (Carolingian) royal family was a means of upward mobility for a soldier or [[Nobility|nobleman]] like William. Her descent from [[Alfred the Great]] (whose daughter [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]] was the mother of [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders]], and great-great-great-great-grandmother of Matilda) also proved a legitimizing factor as queen of England.

Naturally, Baldwin took offence at this; but, before they could [[Duel|draw swords]], Matilda settled the matter{{sfn|Hilliam|2004|p=20}} by refusing to marry anyone but William;{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=17}} even a papal ban by [[Pope Leo IX]] at the [[Council of Reims]] on the grounds of [[consanguinity]] did not dissuade her.

Whatever the truth of the matter, years later when she was acting as [[regent]] for her husband William in England, she is said to have used her authority to confiscate Brictric's lands and throw him into prison, where he died.{{sfn|Freeman|1871|pp=761-764}}\n\n==Duchess of Normandy==\nWhen William was preparing to invade England, Matilda outfitted a ship, the ''[[Mora (ship)|Mora]]'', out of her own funds and gave it to him.{{sfn|van Houts|1988|p=166}} Additionally, William gave [[Normandy]] to his wife during his absence. Matilda successfully guided the duchy through this period in the name of her fourteen-year-old son; no major uprisings or unrest occurred.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|pp= 31\u201332}}\n\nEven after William conquered England and became its king, it took her more than a year to visit the kingdom.{{sfn|Huneycutt|2003|p=50}} Despite having been crowned queen, she spent most of her time in Normandy, governing the duchy, supporting her brother's interests in Flanders, and sponsoring ecclesiastic houses there.

Three new phrases were incorporated to cement the importance of queens, stating that they were divinely placed by God, shared in royal power, and blessed her people by her power and virtue.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p= 33}}{{sfn|Huneycutt|2003|p=51}}\n\nFor many years it was thought that she had some involvement in the creation of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (commonly called ''La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde'' in French), but historians no longer believe that; it seems to have been commissioned by William's half-brother [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]], and made by English artists in [[Kent]].{{sfn|Norton|2001|p=3}}\n\nMatilda bore William nine or ten children. He was believed to have been faithful to her and never produced a child outside their marriage. Despite her royal duties, Matilda was deeply invested in her children's well-being. All were known for being remarkably educated. Her daughters were educated and taught to read Latin at [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen|Sainte-Trinit\u00e9]] in [[Caen]] founded by Matilda and William in response to the recognition of their marriage.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=29}} For her sons, she secured [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] of whom she was an ardent supporter. Both she and William approved of the Archbishop's desire to revitalise the Church.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=37}}\n\nShe stood as godmother for [[Matilda of Scotland]], who would become Queen of England after marrying Matilda's son [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. During the christening, the baby pulled Queen Matilda's headdress down on top of herself, which was seen as an omen that the younger Matilda would be queen some day as well.{{sfn|Huneycutt|2003|p=10}}\n\nMatilda fell ill during the summer of 1083 and died in November 1083. Her husband was present for her final confession.{{sfn|Hilton|2010|p=39}} William died four years later in 1087.\n\nContrary to the common belief that she was buried at St. Stephen's, also called l'[[Abbaye-aux-Hommes]] in [[Caen]], Normandy, where William was eventually buried, she is entombed in Caen at l'[[Abbaye aux Dames]], which is the community of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9. Of particular interest is the 11th-century slab, a sleek black stone decorated with her epitaph, marking her grave at the rear of the church. In contrast, the grave marker for William's tomb was replaced as recently as the beginning of the 19th century.\n\n==Height==\n\nOver time Matilda's tomb was desecrated and her original coffin destroyed. Her remains were placed in a sealed box and reburied under the original black slab.{{sfn|Dewhurst|1981|pp=271\u2013272}} In 1959 Matilda's incomplete skeleton was examined and her femur and tibia were measured to determine her height using anthropometric methods.
