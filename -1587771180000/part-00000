During British rule, and the first decade of independence, the rupee was subdivided into 16 [[Indian anna|annas]]. Each anna was subdivided into 4 [[pice|paisas]]. So one rupee was equal to 64 pice (paisa) In 1957, [[decimalisation]] occurred and the rupee was divided into 100 naye paise (Hindi/Urdu for ''new paisas''). After a few years, the initial \"naye\" was dropped.\n\nFor many years in the early and mid-20th century, the Indian rupee was the official currency in several areas that were controlled by the British and governed from India; areas such as East Africa, Southern [[Arabia]] and the [[Persian Gulf]].\n\n==Early uses==\n[[File:Sher shah's rupee.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Rupiya]]'' issued by the [[Sher Shah Suri]], 1540\u20131545 CE|alt=Silver coins with raised writing]]\n\nThe word \"rupee\" is derived from a [[Sanskrit]] word \"r\u016bpya\", which means \"wrought silver\", and maybe also something stamped with an image or a coin.<ref name=\"etymonline1\">{{cite web | author=etymonline.com | date=20 September 2008 | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=rupee&searchmode=none | title=Etymology of rupee | accessdate=20 September 2008}}</ref> As an adjective it means \"shapely\", with a more specific meaning of \"stamped, impressed\", whence \"coin\".

Original East India Company coins show only the coat of arms of the East India Company.\n\nThe coins of Bengal were developed in the [[Mughal era|Mughal]] style and those of [[Madras]] mostly in a South Indian style. The English coins of Western India developed along Mughal as well as English patterns. It was only in 1717 AD that the British obtained permission from the Emperor [[Farrukh Siyar]] to coin Mughal money at the [[Bombay]] mint. The British gold coins were termed Carolina, the silver coins Anglina, the copper coins Cupperoon and tin coins Tinny. By early 1830, the British had become the dominant power in India.  The [[Coinage Act of 1835]] provided for uniform coinage throughout India. The new coins had the effigy of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] on the obverse and the value on the reverse in English and [[Persian language|Persian]]. The coins issued after 1840 bore the portrait of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. The first coinage under the crown was issued in 1862 and in 1877 Queen Victoria assumed the title the Empress of India. The [[gold silver ratio]] expanded during 1870\u20131910. Unlike India, her colonial master Britain was on the gold standard. To meet the Home Charges (i.e., expenditure in England) the colonial government had to remit a larger number of rupees and this necessitated increased taxation and unrest.\n\n[[File:Rupee1917.jpg|thumb|250px|right|British Indian 1 rupee, 1917]]\nThe 1911 accession to the throne of the King-Emperor [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] led to the famous \"pig rupee\". On the coin, the King appeared wearing the chain of the Order of the Indian Elephant.  Through poor engraving, the elephant looked very much like a pig.  The [[Muslim]] population was enraged and the image had to be quickly redesigned.\n\nAcute shortage of silver during the [[World War I|First World War]], led to the introduction of paper currency of One Rupee and Two and a half Rupees. The silver coins of smaller denominations were issued in cupro-nickel. The compulsion of the [[World War II|Second World War]] led to experiments in coinage where the standard rupee was replaced by the \"Quaternary Silver Alloy\". The Quaternary Silver coins were issued from 1940. In 1947 these were replaced by pure Nickel coins.\n\nImmediately after independence, the British coinage was continued. The Monetary System remained unchanged at One Rupee consisting of 64 pice, or 192 pies.\n\nThe \"Anna Series\" was introduced on 15 August 1950. This was the first coinage of the [[India|Republic of India]]. The King's Portrait was replaced by the Ashoka's Lion Capital. A corn sheaf replaced the Tiger on the one Rupee coin. The monetary system was retained with one Rupee consisting of 16 Annas. The 1955 Indian Coinage (Amendment) Act, that came into force with effect from 1 April 1957, introduced a \"Decimal series\". The rupee was now divided into 100 'Paisa' instead of 16 Annas or 64 Pice. The \"Naye Paise\" coins were minted in the denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 Naye Paise. Both the Anna series and the Naye Paise coins were valid for some time. From 1968 onward, the new coins were called just Paise instead of Naye Paise because they were no more naye = new.\n\nWith high inflation in the sixties, small denomination coins which were made of bronze, nickel-brass, cupro-nickel, and [[aluminium]]-[[bronze]] were gradually minted in Aluminium. This change commenced with the introduction of the new hexagonal 3 paise coin. A twenty paise coin was introduced in 1968 but did not gain much popularity.\n\nOver a period, cost-benefit considerations led to the gradual discontinuance of 1, 2 and 3 paise coins in the 1970s. Stainless steel coinage of 10, 25 and 50 paise, was introduced in 1988 and of one rupee in 1992. The very considerable costs of managing note issues of Rs 1, Rs 2, and Rs 5 led to the gradual coinisation of these denominations in the 1990s.\n\n==Since 1947==\n{{main|Indian rupee}}\nSince its Independence in 1947, India has faced two major financial crises and two consequent devaluations of the rupee: In 1966 and 1991.<ref>[[\"|Devika Johri & Mark Miller. \"Devaluation of the Rupee: Tale of Two Years, 1966 and 1991\" \nhttp://www.ccs.in/ccsindia/policy/money/studies/wp0028.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626051118/http://ccs.in/ccsindia/policy/money/studies/wp0028.pdf |date=26 June 2013 }}]]</ref>\n\n=== Decimalisation ===\nA summary of the decimalisation of the Rupee:<sup><ref>{{cite web |url=https://inrtousd.com/exchange-rate-history-of-us-dollar-usd-to-indian-rupee-inr/action=showghoc&country_name=India |title=inrtousd.com |publisher=inrtousd.com |date=15 September 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2013 }}</ref></sup>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The demand for decimalisation existed for over a century. Sri Lanka decimalised its rupee in 1869. The ''Indian Coinage Act'' was amended in September 1955 for the adoption of a decimal system for coinage. The Act came into force with effect from 1 April 1957. The rupee remained unchanged in value and nomenclature. It, however, was now divided into 100 '[[Paisa]]' instead of 16 [[Indian anna|Annas]] or 64 [[Pice]]. For public recognition, the new decimal Paisa was termed 'Naya Paisa' until 1 June 1964 when the term 'Naya' was dropped. The coins of that period also mentioned their value in terms of the rupee to avoid confusion and cheating. For example, the one paisa coin carried the text \"One-hundredth of a Rupee\" in Hindi.\n\n=== 1966 Economic crisis ===\nFrom 1950, India ran continued trade deficits that increased in magnitude in the 1960s. Furthermore, the Government of India had a budget deficit problem and could not borrow money from abroad or from the private corporate sector, due to that sector's negative savings rate. As a result, the government issued bonds to the RBI, which increased the money supply, leading to inflation. In 1966, foreign aid, which had hitherto been a key factor in preventing devaluation of the rupee, was finally cut off and India was told it had to liberalise its restrictions on trade before foreign aid would again materialise. The response was the politically unpopular step of devaluation accompanied by liberalisation. Furthermore, The [[Indo-Pakistan War of 1965]] led the US and other countries friendly towards Pakistan to withdraw foreign aid to India, which necessitated more devaluation. Defense spending in 1965/1966 was 24.06% of total expenditure, the highest it has been in the period from 1965 to 1989 (Foundations, pp 195). Another factor leading to devaluation was the drought of 1965/1966 which resulted in a sharp rise in prices.\n\nAt the end of 1969, the Indian Rupee was trading at around 13 British pence{{clarify|date=July 2012}}. A decade later, by 1979, it was trading at around 6 British pence. Finally, by the end of 1989, the Indian Rupee had plunged to an all-time low of 3 British pence. This triggered a wave of irreversible liberalisation reforms away from populist measures.\n\n=== 1991 Economic crisis ===\nIn 1991, India still had a fixed exchange system, where the rupee was pegged to the value of a basket of currencies of major trading partners. India started having the balance of payments problems since 1985, and by the end of 1990, it found itself in serious [[1991 India economic crisis|economic trouble]]. The government was close to default and its foreign exchange reserves had dried up to the point that India could barely finance three weeks\u2019 worth of imports. As in 1966, India faced high inflation and large [[government budget deficit]]s. This led the government to devalue the rupee.<ref name=GT-DEX-1500-20XX-CN-MP-X/>\n\nAt the end of 1999, the Indian Rupee was devalued considerably.\n\n=== Revaluation ===\nIn the period between 2000 and 2007, the Rupee stopped declining and stabilised ranging between 1 $ = Rs 44\u2013 Rs 48. In late 2007, the Indian Rupee reached a record high of 39 Indian national rupee per United States dollars, on account of sustained foreign investment flows into the country. This posed problems for major exporters, IT and BPO firms located in the country who were incurring losses in their earnings given the appreciation in rupee. The trend has reversed lately with the 2008 world financial crisis as Foreign investors transferred huge sums out to their own countries. Such appreciations were reflected in many currencies, e.g. the British sterling pounds, which had gained value against the dollar and then has lost value again with the recession of 2008.\n\n===2013 Depreciation===\nDue to stagnant reforms, and declining foreign investment, rupee started depreciating in the early 2013.<ref>[http://profit.ndtv.com/news/forex/article-rupee-crashes-to-68-75-per-dollar-as-foreign-investors-flee-326381 Rupee crashes to 68.75 per dollar as foreign investors flee - NDTVProfit.com].

Later on, new notes of old denominations viz. \u20b910, \u20b920, \u20b950 and \u20b9100 were issued with old notes of the same value still being legal tender. A \u20b9200 note, also a first for the Indian Rupee, is currently in circulation.\n\n== Banknotes ==\n\n=== Early paper issues ===\nNotes issued by the [[Bank of Bengal]] can be categorised in the following three series.\n\n* '''Unifaced series''': The early notes of the Bank of Bengal were printed only on one side and were issued as one ''gold mohur'' and in denominations of Rs. 100, Rs. 250, Rs. 500, etc.\n* '''Commerce series''': Later notes had a vignette representing an allegorical female figure personifying 'commerce'. The notes were printed on both sides. On the obverse the name of the bank and the denominations were printed in three scripts, viz., ([[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Devanagari]]). On the reverse of such notes was printed a cartouche with ornamentation carrying the name of the Bank.\n* '''Britannia series''': By the late 19th century, the motif 'commerce' was replaced by 'Britannia'. The new banknotes had more features to prevent forgery.\n\n=== British India issues ===\nThe [[Paper Currency Act of 1861]] gave the Government the monopoly of note issue throughout the vast expanse of British India, which was a considerable task. Eventually, the management of paper currency was entrusted to the Mint Masters, the Accountant Generals and the Controller of Currency.\n\n* '''Victoria portrait series''': The first set of British India notes were the '[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] Portrait' series issued in denominations of Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 50, Rs 100 and 1,000. These were unifaced, carried two language panels. The security features incorporated the watermark, the printed signature and the registration of the notes.\n* '''Underprint series''': The unifaced Underprint series was introduced in 1867 as the Victoria Portrait series was withdrawn in the wake of a spate of forgeries. These notes were issued in denominations of Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 50, Rs 100, Rs 500, Rs 1,000 and Rs 10,000.\n* '''George V series''': A series carrying the portrait of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] were introduced in 1923, and was continued as an integral feature of all paper money issues of British India. These notes were issued in denominations of Rs 1, Rs {{frac|2|1|2}}, Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 50, Rs 100, Rs 1,000, and Rs 10,000.\n\n=== Reserve Bank issues during British India ===\nThe Reserve Bank of India was formally inaugurated on Monday, 1 April 1935 with its Central Office at Calcutta. Section 22 of the RBI Act, 1934, empowered it to continue issuing Government of India notes until its own notes were ready for issue. The bank issued the first five rupee note bearing the portrait of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] in 1938. This was followed by Rs. 10 in February, Rs 100 in March and Rs 1,000 and Rs 10,000 in June 1938. The first Reserve Bank issues were signed by the second Governor, [[Sir James Taylor]]. In August 1940, the one-rupee note was reintroduced as a wartime measure, as a Government note with the status of a rupee coin. During the war, the Japanese produced high-quality forgeries of the Indian currency. This necessitated a change in the watermark. The profile portrait of George VI was changed to his full frontal portrait. The security thread was introduced for the first time in India. The George VI series continued till 1947 and thereafter as a frozen series till 1950 when post-independence notes were issued.\n\n=== Republic of India issues ===\nFollowing the [[Independence of India]] the Government of India brought out the new design Re.1 note in 1949. Initially, it was felt that the King's portrait is replaced by a portrait of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Finally, however, the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] was chosen. The new design of notes were largely along earlier lines. In 1953, [[Hindi]] was displayed prominently on the new notes. The economic crisis in the late 1960s led to a reduction in the size of notes in 1967. High denomination notes, like Rs. 10,000 notes were demonetized in 1978.\n\nThe first \"[[Mahatma Gandhi Series]]\" was introduced in 1996.

It was maintained as the florin, using the same standard, until 1920. In [[Somalia]] the Italian colonial authority minted 'Rupia' to exactly the same standard, and called the paisa 'besa'. Early 18th-century E.I.C. rupees were used in Australia for a limited period.\n\n* '''Jammu and Kashmir issues''': Maharaja [[Ranbir Singh (Maharaja)|Rambir Singh]] introduced paper money on watermarked paper in 1877. The notes were not very popular and were in circulation for a very short period. The notes carried the 'Sun' motif of the [[Dogra]] family.\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Five-rupee note from Hyderabad\n\n| width     = 150\n\n| image1    = Five-rupee note from Hyderabad.jpg\n| alt1      = Five-rupee note from Hyderabad\n\n| image2    = Five-rupee note from Hyderabad anoyher side.jpg\n| alt2      = Five-rupee note from Hyderabad\n}}\n* '''Hyderabad issues''': The Government of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] had made several efforts to organize private bankers to set up a banking company which could issue paper money. The British, however, resisted the attempts of Indian [[princely state]]s to issue paper currency. The acute shortage of silver during the [[First World War]] and the contributions of [[Hyderabad State]] to the British war effort led them to accept, in 1918, paper currency in denominations of Rs.10/- and Rs.100/- issued under the Hyderabad Currency Act. The currency was designated the ''Osmania Sicca'' (OS). Rupee One and Rupees Five notes were issued subsequently in 1919 and Rupees One Thousand notes were issued in 1926. After the setting up of the India Currency Notes Press at [[Nasik]], Hyderabad notes came to be printed there.\n* '''Burma issues''': Burma separated from India in 1938; however, the Reserve Bank of India acted as Banker to the Government of [[Burma]] and was responsible for note issue in terms of the Burma Monetary Arrangements Order, 1937. In May 1938 the Bank issued Burma notes which were not legal tender in India.\n* '''Indo-French issues''': The French Indian rupee (FIR) was introduced by France's Bank of [[Indochina]] in [[French India|French colonies]] of [[India]].\n* '''Indo-Portuguese issues ''': The Portuguese Indian Rupia was the currency of [[Portuguese India]] until 1959. It was divisible into 16 [[Tanga (currency)|Tangas]] or 960 Reis. In 1959, the currency was changed to the [[Portuguese Indian Escudo]], at the rate of 1 Rupia for 6 Escudos.\n* '''Persian Gulf issues''': For many years in the early and mid-20th century, the Indian rupee was the official currency in several areas that were controlled by the British and governed from India: areas such as East Africa, Southern [[Arabia]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]. The rupees used in the Persian Gulf had been bought by the Gulf states from the [[Reserve Bank of India]], who held the sterling reserves by which the rupees had originally been purchased. However, Indian rupees were being smuggled from India to the states of the Persian Gulf in exchange for gold. It was estimated in 1959 that the total amount of gold in private hands in India was about $US1.75 to 2 billion&nbsp;\u2013 roughly two-thirds of the value of paper money in circulation. While it was legal to own and to trade in gold within India, it was illegal to import or export gold. The Gulf Rupee, also known as the Persian Gulf Rupee (PGR), was introduced by the [[India]]n government as a replacement for the [[Indian Rupee]] for circulation exclusively outside the country with the Reserve Bank of India Amendment Act, 1 May 1959. After India devalued the rupee on June 1966, those countries still using it \u2013 [[Oman]], [[Qatar]] and what is now the [[United Arab Emirates]] (known as the Trucial States until 1971)&nbsp;\u2013 replaced the Gulf Rupee with their own currencies. [[Kuwait]] and [[Bahrain]] had already done so in 1961 and 1965 respectively.\n* '''Emergency issues,  Princely states''': During the 1940s, when mints were occupied for use in the war, an acute scarcity of small coins was felt throughout India. Princely states in Western India like [[Balvan (princely state)|Balvan]], [[Bikaner]], [[Bundi]], [[Gondal, India|Gondal]], [[Indergadh]], [[Junagadh]], [[Jasdan]], [[Kutch]] Mengni, [[Muli (princely state)|Muli]], [[Morvi]], [[Mangrol, Kathiawar|Mangrol]], [[Nawanagar State|Nawanagar]], [[Nawalgarh (princely state)|Nawalgarh]] Palitana, [[Rajkot]], [[Sailana]], [[Sayla]], [[Vithalgadh]], issued \"Cash Coupons\" to meet the shortage.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:GULFINR.jpg|Hyderabad state OS Rs. 100 issue\nImage:INR1922.jpg|Five rupees, 1922\nImage:Port_rupia.JPG|Portuguese Indian 1 rupee, 1924\nImage:French1rupee.jpg|French Indian 1 rupee, 1938\nImage:1937INRpro.jpg|George VI profile portrait, RBI, 1937\nImage:KGVI rupee 1 note obverse.jpg|One rupee, British India\nImage:INR1943.jpg|George VI profile portrait changed to frontal portrait, RBI, 1943\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Numismatics|Money}}\n{{col div|colwidth=25em}}\n*[[Tables of historical exchange rates to the india rupee]]\n*[[The Revised Standard Reference Guide to Indian Paper Money]]\n*[[Rupee]]\n*[[Indian rupee]]\n*[[Mauritian rupee]]\n*[[Pakistani rupee]]\n*[[Nepali rupee]]\n*[[Coinage of India]]\n*[[Coins of British India]]\n*[[History of the taka]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n<ref name=GT-DEX-1500-20XX-CN-MP-X>{{cite web|title=Devaluation of the Rupee: Tale of Two Years, 1966 and 1991|url=http://ccs.in/ccsindia/policy/money/studies/wp0028.pdf|accessdate=4 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329195215/http://www.ccs.in/ccsindia/policy/money/studies/wp0028.pdf|archive-date=29 March 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516085855/http://www.rbi.org.in/currency/museum/c-mogul.html Picture of original ''Rupiya'' introduced by Sher Shah Suri]\n* [http://www.rbi.org.in/currency/museum/c-overview.html Reserve Bank of India Monetary Museum]\n* [http://www.rbi.org.in/personalised/personalisation.asp?filename=currency.html&secid=other Reserve Bank of India]\n\n{{Rupee}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Rupee}}\n[[Category:Currencies of India]]\n[[Category:Currencies of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Economic history of India]]\n[[Category:History of money|Rupee]]\n[[Category:Financial history of India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2010}}\n[[File:MauryanCoin.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Silver coin of the [[Maurya Empire]], known as ''R\u016bpyar\u016bpa'', with symbols of wheel and elephant. 3rd century BCE.<ref name=\"Redy\" />]]\nThe '''history of the Rupee''' traces back to [[Ancient India]].

During British rule, and the first decade of independence, the rupee was subdivided into 16 [[Indian anna|annas]]. Each anna was subdivided into 4 [[pice|paisas]]. So one rupee was equal to 64 pice (paisa) In 1957, [[decimalisation]] occurred and the rupee was divided into 100 naye paise (Hindi/Urdu for ''new paisas'').

It was only in 1717 AD that the British obtained permission from the Emperor [[Farrukh Siyar]] to coin Mughal money at the [[Bombay]] mint. The British gold coins were termed Carolina, the silver coins Anglina, the copper coins Cupperoon and tin coins Tinny. By early 1830, the British had become the dominant power in India.  The [[Coinage Act of 1835]] provided for uniform coinage throughout India. The new coins had the effigy of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] on the obverse and the value on the reverse in English and [[Persian language|Persian]]. The coins issued after 1840 bore the portrait of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. The first coinage under the crown was issued in 1862 and in 1877 Queen Victoria assumed the title the Empress of India. The [[gold silver ratio]] expanded during 1870\u20131910. Unlike India, her colonial master Britain was on the gold standard. To meet the Home Charges (i.e., expenditure in England) the colonial government had to remit a larger number of rupees and this necessitated increased taxation and unrest.\n\n[[File:Rupee1917.jpg|thumb|250px|right|British Indian 1 rupee, 1917]]\nThe 1911 accession to the throne of the King-Emperor [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] led to the famous \"pig rupee\". On the coin, the King appeared wearing the chain of the Order of the Indian Elephant.  Through poor engraving, the elephant looked very much like a pig.  The [[Muslim]] population was enraged and the image had to be quickly redesigned.\n\nAcute shortage of silver during the [[World War I|First World War]], led to the introduction of paper currency of One Rupee and Two and a half Rupees. The silver coins of smaller denominations were issued in cupro-nickel. The compulsion of the [[World War II|Second World War]] led to experiments in coinage where the standard rupee was replaced by the \"Quaternary Silver Alloy\". The Quaternary Silver coins were issued from 1940. In 1947 these were replaced by pure Nickel coins.\n\nImmediately after independence, the British coinage was continued. The Monetary System remained unchanged at One Rupee consisting of 64 pice, or 192 pies.\n\nThe \"Anna Series\" was introduced on 15 August 1950. This was the first coinage of the [[India|Republic of India]]. The King's Portrait was replaced by the Ashoka's Lion Capital. A corn sheaf replaced the Tiger on the one Rupee coin. The monetary system was retained with one Rupee consisting of 16 Annas. The 1955 Indian Coinage (Amendment) Act, that came into force with effect from 1 April 1957, introduced a \"Decimal series\". The rupee was now divided into 100 'Paisa' instead of 16 Annas or 64 Pice. The \"Naye Paise\" coins were minted in the denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 Naye Paise. Both the Anna series and the Naye Paise coins were valid for some time. From 1968 onward, the new coins were called just Paise instead of Naye Paise because they were no more naye = new.\n\nWith high inflation in the sixties, small denomination coins which were made of bronze, nickel-brass, cupro-nickel, and [[aluminium]]-[[bronze]] were gradually minted in Aluminium. This change commenced with the introduction of the new hexagonal 3 paise coin. A twenty paise coin was introduced in 1968 but did not gain much popularity.\n\nOver a period, cost-benefit considerations led to the gradual discontinuance of 1, 2 and 3 paise coins in the 1970s. Stainless steel coinage of 10, 25 and 50 paise, was introduced in 1988 and of one rupee in 1992. The very considerable costs of managing note issues of Rs 1, Rs 2, and Rs 5 led to the gradual coinisation of these denominations in the 1990s.\n\n==Since 1947==\n{{main|Indian rupee}}\nSince its Independence in 1947, India has faced two major financial crises and two consequent devaluations of the rupee: In 1966 and 1991.<ref>[[\"|Devika Johri & Mark Miller. \"Devaluation of the Rupee: Tale of Two Years, 1966 and 1991\" \nhttp://www.ccs.in/ccsindia/policy/money/studies/wp0028.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626051118/http://ccs.in/ccsindia/policy/money/studies/wp0028.pdf |date=26 June 2013 }}]]</ref>\n\n=== Decimalisation ===\nA summary of the decimalisation of the Rupee:<sup><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.globalfinancialdata.com/index_tabs.php?action=showghoc&country_name=India |title=Global Financial Data |publisher=Global Financial Data |date=15 September 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></sup>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The demand for decimalisation existed for over a century. Sri Lanka decimalised its rupee in 1869. The ''Indian Coinage Act'' was amended in September 1955 for the adoption of a decimal system for coinage. The Act came into force with effect from 1 April 1957. The rupee remained unchanged in value and nomenclature. It, however, was now divided into 100 '[[Paisa]]' instead of 16 [[Indian anna|Annas]] or 64 [[Pice]]. For public recognition, the new decimal Paisa was termed 'Naya Paisa' until 1 June 1964 when the term 'Naya' was dropped. The coins of that period also mentioned their value in terms of the rupee to avoid confusion and cheating. For example, the one paisa coin carried the text \"One-hundredth of a Rupee\" in Hindi.\n\n=== 1966 Economic crisis ===\nFrom 1950, India ran continued trade deficits that increased in magnitude in the 1960s. Furthermore, the Government of India had a budget deficit problem and could not borrow money from abroad or from the private corporate sector, due to that sector's negative savings rate. As a result, the government issued bonds to the RBI, which increased the money supply, leading to inflation. In 1966, foreign aid, which had hitherto been a key factor in preventing devaluation of the rupee, was finally cut off and India was told it had to liberalise its restrictions on trade before foreign aid would again materialise. The response was the politically unpopular step of devaluation accompanied by liberalisation. Furthermore, The [[Indo-Pakistan War of 1965]] led the US and other countries friendly towards Pakistan to withdraw foreign aid to India, which necessitated more devaluation. Defense spending in 1965/1966 was 24.06% of total expenditure, the highest it has been in the period from 1965 to 1989 (Foundations, pp 195). Another factor leading to devaluation was the drought of 1965/1966 which resulted in a sharp rise in prices.\n\nAt the end of 1969, the Indian Rupee was trading at around 13 British pence{{clarify|date=July 2012}}. A decade later, by 1979, it was trading at around 6 British pence. Finally, by the end of 1989, the Indian Rupee had plunged to an all-time low of 3 British pence. This triggered a wave of irreversible liberalisation reforms away from populist measures.\n\n=== 1991 Economic crisis ===\nIn 1991, India still had a fixed exchange system, where the rupee was pegged to the value of a basket of currencies of major trading partners. India started having the balance of payments problems since 1985, and by the end of 1990, it found itself in serious [[1991 India economic crisis|economic trouble]]. The government was close to default and its foreign exchange reserves had dried up to the point that India could barely finance three weeks\u2019 worth of imports. As in 1966, India faced high inflation and large [[government budget deficit]]s. This led the government to devalue the rupee.<ref name=GT-DEX-1500-20XX-CN-MP-X/>\n\nAt the end of 1999, the Indian Rupee was devalued considerably.\n\n=== Revaluation ===\nIn the period between 2000 and 2007, the Rupee stopped declining and stabilised ranging between 1 $ = Rs 44\u2013 Rs 48. In late 2007, the Indian Rupee reached a record high of 39 Indian national rupee per United States dollars, on account of sustained foreign investment flows into the country. This posed problems for major exporters, IT and BPO firms located in the country who were incurring losses in their earnings given the appreciation in rupee. The trend has reversed lately with the 2008 world financial crisis as Foreign investors transferred huge sums out to their own countries. Such appreciations were reflected in many currencies, e.g. the British sterling pounds, which had gained value against the dollar and then has lost value again with the recession of 2008.\n\n===2013 Depreciation===\nDue to stagnant reforms, and declining foreign investment, rupee started depreciating in the early 2013.<ref>[http://profit.ndtv.com/news/forex/article-rupee-crashes-to-68-75-per-dollar-as-foreign-investors-flee-326381 Rupee crashes to 68.75 per dollar as foreign investors flee - NDTVProfit.com].

Later on, new notes of old denominations viz. \u20b910, \u20b920, \u20b950 and \u20b9100 were issued with old notes of the same value still being legal tender. A \u20b9200 note, also a first for the Indian Rupee, is currently in circulation.\n\n== Banknotes ==\n\n=== Early paper issues ===\nNotes issued by the [[Bank of Bengal]] can be categorised in the following three series.\n\n* '''Unifaced series''': The early notes of the Bank of Bengal were printed only on one side and were issued as one ''gold mohur'' and in denominations of Rs. 100, Rs. 250, Rs. 500, etc.\n* '''Commerce series''': Later notes had a vignette representing an allegorical female figure personifying 'commerce'. The notes were printed on both sides. On the obverse the name of the bank and the denominations were printed in three scripts, viz., ([[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Devanagari]]). On the reverse of such notes was printed a cartouche with ornamentation carrying the name of the Bank.\n* '''Britannia series''': By the late 19th century, the motif 'commerce' was replaced by 'Britannia'. The new banknotes had more features to prevent forgery.\n\n=== British India issues ===\nThe [[Paper Currency Act of 1861]] gave the Government the monopoly of note issue throughout the vast expanse of British India, which was a considerable task. Eventually, the management of paper currency was entrusted to the Mint Masters, the Accountant Generals and the Controller of Currency.\n\n* '''Victoria portrait series''': The first set of British India notes were the '[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] Portrait' series issued in denominations of Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 50, Rs 100 and 1,000. These were unifaced, carried two language panels. The security features incorporated the watermark, the printed signature and the registration of the notes.\n* '''Underprint series''': The unifaced Underprint series was introduced in 1867 as the Victoria Portrait series was withdrawn in the wake of a spate of forgeries. These notes were issued in denominations of Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 50, Rs 100, Rs 500, Rs 1,000 and Rs 10,000.\n* '''George V series''': A series carrying the portrait of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] were introduced in 1923, and was continued as an integral feature of all paper money issues of British India. These notes were issued in denominations of Rs 1, Rs {{frac|2|1|2}}, Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 50, Rs 100, Rs 1,000, and Rs 10,000.\n\n=== Reserve Bank issues during British India ===\nThe Reserve Bank of India was formally inaugurated on Monday, 1 April 1935 with its Central Office at Calcutta. Section 22 of the RBI Act, 1934, empowered it to continue issuing Government of India notes until its own notes were ready for issue. The bank issued the first five rupee note bearing the portrait of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] in 1938. This was followed by Rs. 10 in February, Rs 100 in March and Rs 1,000 and Rs 10,000 in June 1938. The first Reserve Bank issues were signed by the second Governor, [[Sir James Taylor]]. In August 1940, the one-rupee note was reintroduced as a wartime measure, as a Government note with the status of a rupee coin. During the war, the Japanese produced high-quality forgeries of the Indian currency. This necessitated a change in the watermark. The profile portrait of George VI was changed to his full frontal portrait. The security thread was introduced for the first time in India. The George VI series continued till 1947 and thereafter as a frozen series till 1950 when post-independence notes were issued.\n\n=== Republic of India issues ===\nFollowing the [[Independence of India]] the Government of India brought out the new design Re.1 note in 1949. Initially, it was felt that the King's portrait is replaced by a portrait of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Finally, however, the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] was chosen. The new design of notes were largely along earlier lines. In 1953, [[Hindi]] was displayed prominently on the new notes. The economic crisis in the late 1960s led to a reduction in the size of notes in 1967. High denomination notes, like Rs. 10,000 notes were demonetized in 1978.\n\nThe first \"[[Mahatma Gandhi Series]]\" was introduced in 1996. Prominent new features included a changed watermark, windowed security thread, latent image and intaglio features for the visually handicapped.\n\nThe [[Indian 500 and 1000 rupee currency demonetisation|five hundred (\u20b9500) and one thousand rupee notes (\u20b91,000) were demonetised]] by an unscheduled address to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi starting from midnight 8 November 2016.<ref>{{Citation|last=Spotlight|title=[English]PM Modi's Surgical Strike on Corruption {{!}} 500,1000 Rupee Notes Not Legal Tender Anymore|date=8 November 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUpPE8UDEzo|accessdate=8 November 2016 |via=YouTube}}</ref> These notes are being replaced by the [[Mahatma Gandhi New Series]] of notes.\n\n== Valuation history ==\n[[File:INR-USD v2.svg|thumb|450px|right|INR value against USD]]\nThe [[Indian rupee|rupee]] was never equal to the [[United States dollar|dollar]].

It was maintained as the florin, using the same standard, until 1920. In [[Somalia]] the Italian colonial authority minted 'Rupia' to exactly the same standard, and called the paisa 'besa'. Early 18th-century E.I.C. rupees were used in Australia for a limited period.\n\n* '''Jammu and Kashmir issues''': Maharaja [[Ranbir Singh (Maharaja)|Rambir Singh]] introduced paper money on watermarked paper in 1877. The notes were not very popular and were in circulation for a very short period. The notes carried the 'Sun' motif of the [[Dogra]] family.\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Five-rupee note from Hyderabad\n\n| width     = 150\n\n| image1    = Five-rupee note from Hyderabad.jpg\n| alt1      = Five-rupee note from Hyderabad\n\n| image2    = Five-rupee note from Hyderabad anoyher side.jpg\n| alt2      = Five-rupee note from Hyderabad\n}}\n* '''Hyderabad issues''': The Government of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] had made several efforts to organize private bankers to set up a banking company which could issue paper money. The British, however, resisted the attempts of Indian [[princely state]]s to issue paper currency. The acute shortage of silver during the [[First World War]] and the contributions of [[Hyderabad State]] to the British war effort led them to accept, in 1918, paper currency in denominations of Rs.10/- and Rs.100/- issued under the Hyderabad Currency Act. The currency was designated the ''Osmania Sicca'' (OS). Rupee One and Rupees Five notes were issued subsequently in 1919 and Rupees One Thousand notes were issued in 1926. After the setting up of the India Currency Notes Press at [[Nasik]], Hyderabad notes came to be printed there.\n* '''Burma issues''': Burma separated from India in 1938; however, the Reserve Bank of India acted as Banker to the Government of [[Burma]] and was responsible for note issue in terms of the Burma Monetary Arrangements Order, 1937. In May 1938 the Bank issued Burma notes which were not legal tender in India.\n* '''Indo-French issues''': The French Indian rupee (FIR) was introduced by France's Bank of [[Indochina]] in [[French India|French colonies]] of [[India]].\n* '''Indo-Portuguese issues ''': The Portuguese Indian Rupia was the currency of [[Portuguese India]] until 1959. It was divisible into 16 [[Tanga (currency)|Tangas]] or 960 Reis. In 1959, the currency was changed to the [[Portuguese Indian Escudo]], at the rate of 1 Rupia for 6 Escudos.\n* '''Persian Gulf issues''': For many years in the early and mid-20th century, the Indian rupee was the official currency in several areas that were controlled by the British and governed from India: areas such as East Africa, Southern [[Arabia]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]. The rupees used in the Persian Gulf had been bought by the Gulf states from the [[Reserve Bank of India]], who held the sterling reserves by which the rupees had originally been purchased. However, Indian rupees were being smuggled from India to the states of the Persian Gulf in exchange for gold. It was estimated in 1959 that the total amount of gold in private hands in India was about $US1.75 to 2 billion&nbsp;\u2013 roughly two-thirds of the value of paper money in circulation. While it was legal to own and to trade in gold within India, it was illegal to import or export gold. The Gulf Rupee, also known as the Persian Gulf Rupee (PGR), was introduced by the [[India]]n government as a replacement for the [[Indian Rupee]] for circulation exclusively outside the country with the Reserve Bank of India Amendment Act, 1 May 1959. After India devalued the rupee on June 1966, those countries still using it \u2013 [[Oman]], [[Qatar]] and what is now the [[United Arab Emirates]] (known as the Trucial States until 1971)&nbsp;\u2013 replaced the Gulf Rupee with their own currencies. [[Kuwait]] and [[Bahrain]] had already done so in 1961 and 1965 respectively.\n* '''Emergency issues,  Princely states''': During the 1940s, when mints were occupied for use in the war, an acute scarcity of small coins was felt throughout India.
