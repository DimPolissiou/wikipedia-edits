Jagdkommando soldiers are highly trained professionals whose thorough and rigorous training enables them to take over when tasks or situations outgrow the capabilities and specialisation of conventional units.\n\n==History==\n\nThe name \u201cJagdkommando\u201d has its origins in the time of [[World War I]], when small assault squads of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian K.u.K. Army]] were called what translates to \u201cmanhunt command.\u201d\n\nThe history of the Austrian Special Operations Forces began in 1961, when a group of Austrian officers participated in the [[US Army]]'s [[Ranger School]] as part of their training in order to set up a similar course for the eventual establishment of Jagdkommando. Since then, the officers and soldiers of Jagdkommando have continued to evolve by taking part in similar courses in the [[United States]] and all over [[Europe]] and by combining the lessons learned with \"homegrown\" tactics and knowledge. The unit has earned the respect of other nations' special forces very quickly. The headquarters of the Jagdkommando is located in [[Wiener Neustadt]].\n\nMost of the missions are classified, but the Jagdkommando usually operates in places where regular Austrian troops are also located - such as the [[Balkans]] ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], etc.), [[Afghanistan]] ([[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]], until 2005) and [[Chad]] ([[EUFOR Tchad/RCA]], since 2008). In the east of Chad about 50 Jagdkommando soldiers are deployed to protect refugee camps near the border to [[Darfur]] from early 2008 on.<ref>[http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/tschad.htm 2007 - Jagdkommando prepares for Tchad Mission]</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the Jagdkommando was deployed to Mali alongside French SOF as part of Operation Barkhane.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20160617142346/http://www.janes.com/article/61468/jagdkommando-readies-vt-hunter-otv-for-possible-west-african-operations</ref> They would be deployed with [[French Armed Forces|French troops]] under [[Operation Barkhane]].<ref>https://www.sofx.com/2016/06/25/austrian-special-forces-prepare-deployment-mali-defenceweb/</ref>\n\n===Current structure===\n*Headquarters\n**1st Special Operations Task Group\n**2nd Special Operations Task Group\n**3rd Special Operations Task Group (''Reserve'')\n\n==Selection and training==\n[[File:Jagdkommando Fallschirmspringer.jpg|thumb|Jagdkommando airborne operations]]\n\nSelection is usually held once a year and has a duration of 6 months. The program normally begins in January with 3 weeks of pre-selection. During this time the candidate will take the physical tests required, receive additional training and undergo a 72-hour Field Exercise, which is the core event of the selection process.\n\nMost candidates will fail during the 72-hour exercise which includes long road marches in squad size elements, psychological test batteries, and total sleep deprivation. The pre-selection course is conducted by active operators as well as by enablers of the unit.\n[[File:Jagdkommando trainiert (29638388276).jpg|thumb|Two soldiers of the Jagdkommando]]\nNormally 20-25% of all candidates will pass the pre selection course and continue with the so-called Jagdkommandogrundkurs, the basic course of selection. The first few weeks are held in the remote area of [[Allentsteig]], a giant military training area in close proximity to the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] border. The first seven weeks of small unit tactics are overshadowed with plenty of snow, freezing weather, very small amounts of sleep and permanent physical performance. Candidates will get used to the heavy Lowe Rucksack and spend most of their day with it on their backs while conducting patrols, ambushes, and raids in the forests around Allentsteig.\n\nAfter the small unit tactics phase, which will eliminate the last few unfitting candidates, the basic course will continue with block course of two or three weeks each:\n*Basic Demolition Course\n*Airborne Course\n*Amphibious Insertion/Extraction Course\n*Field Survival Course\n*Basic CQB Course\n*Combat diver Course\n*Field training exercises[[File:Jagdkommando Kampfschwimmer.jpg|thumb|Jagdkommando frogmen]][[File:Luftlandung (19889238211).jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the Jagdkommando rope down a [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk]]]]\n*SERE\n\n===SERE===\nThe final and most infamous course is the SERE training. Over the last few years the SERE training took part in the [[Alps]] of [[Salzburg]]. The \u201crun phase\u201d will last up to ten days, while the candidate must check in at a given checkpoints every 24 hours. The checkpoints are set 20\u201330&nbsp;km apart, considering the mountains in between the points and the tactical need to stay off roads and trails, the candidates will be very busy meeting their time limits and rarely find sleep. Finally after days on the run and being hunted down by infantry units, helicopters and [[Police dog|K9]] units, the candidates will be ambushed and captured at one of their checkpoints. This marks the beginning of the \u201ccaptivity phase\u201d. Being the last phase of the selection course this phase will last 72 hours.\n\nAfter completing the SERE course the remaining soldiers (normally 10-15% of all applicants who started the pre selection course) are accepted into the Jagdkomamndo brotherhood and awarded the \u201cmudd-green\u201d beret with the Unit Crest on it. Most of the graduates will be given a slot as active operators in one of the two Task Groups of the unit, while some go back to their regular Army unit.\n\nJagdkommando soldiers take extreme pride in their long and unique selection course and the prestige that comes along with earning the olive beret inside the armed forces.\n[[File:Austria (\u00d6sterreich), Zeltweg (Flughafen Hinterstoisser), AirPower 2013, OH-58 Kiowa, 0190.JPG|thumb|A soldier of the Jagdkommando on a [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa]]]]\nIf a soldier is chosen to become an operator after selection he will attend the Einsatzausbildung 1, a course where he will refine his operator skills. The training will last up to one year.\n\nNormally it starts off with a five-week drivers course, followed by shooting classes. This will be the first time for operators to use the advanced weapon systems Steyr AUG A2 Kdo and the FN P90. After weeks at the shooting range the next courses will be very mountain orientated, like the mountain airborne course, winter warfare and mountaineering courses as well as ski training.\n\nAfter the mountain courses the individual job training will begin. Depending on the assignment the operator will attend the Weapon Sergeant Course, Medic Course, Communications Sergeant Course or Engineer Course.\n\nThe SOF [[Close combat|CQB]] course that follows teaches the latest techniques in HRO, CC, and DDO. Jagdkommando operators train together with several NATO SOF units worldwide and so the used SOPs and tactics are very similar to other SOF units.\n[[File:Jagdkommando-Soldaten springen aus einer \"Hercules\" (18629580342).jpg|thumb|Jagdkommando soldiers jump out of a C-130 Hercules]]\n[[File:Zugriff (21734716363).jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the Jagdkommando capture a ship on the Danube]]\nDifferent other courses will complete the Einsatzausbildung 1, such as the Urban SR course, advanced combatives training and Air Assault techniques.\n\nAfter more than 18 months of training the operator will be assigned a team in the 1st SOTG (Special Operations Task Group) or the 2nd SOTG. The 3rd SOTG belongs to the Army Reserve Component. A typical Jagdkommando team consists of six operators: the Team Leader, Team Sergeant, a Weapons Sergeant/Sniper, Engineer Sergeant, Medic Sergeant and Communication Sergeant. Each team is assigned to one insertion speciality, such as freefall, amphibious, mountain and mobility.\n\n==Equipment==\n\n* [[Barrett M95]]<ref name=\"dasjakdo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/jakdo.htm |title=Das Jagdkommando (Jakdo) |language=German |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref>\n* [[Barrett M82]]<ref name=\"dasjakdo\"/>\n* [[FN Herstal]] [[FN P90|P90]]<ref name=\"dasjakdo\"/><ref>S\u00fcnkler, S\u00f6ren. \"Elite und Spezialeinheiten Europas\" (in German).

He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. On the 18th of July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. The Secretary of the club, C. J, Williams disputed the way the Auckland Rugby League had handled the matter and several of the facts in a letter to the [[Auckland Star]]. The ARL Chairman, Mr. W.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, August 23 onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. On the 18th of July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. The Secretary of the club, C. J, Williams disputed the way the Auckland Rugby League had handled the matter and several of the facts in a letter to the [[Auckland Star]]. The ARL Chairman, Mr. W. Hammill replied to the letter \"that the matters contained therein were hardly correct\"<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Why Manukau Changed Over/Management Criticised/Unsatisfactory Decisions\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume 55, Issue 164\n| date = 1924-07-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240712.2.20\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>.\n\n===Goals From Marks===\nAt the ARL Management Committee meeting on August 13 the Referee's Association reported that goals from marks would no longer be permitted. This rule would come into place from Saturday, August 23 onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

{"title_page": "List of prizes known as the Nobel of a field", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\nSeveral fields of human cultural and scientific development are not included in the list of [[Nobel Prize]]s, because they are either not among the prizes established as part of [[Alfred Nobel]]'s will nor, in the case of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], sponsored afterwards by the [[Nobel Foundation]]. While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation.

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2019. This was the first season with new host and former winner, [[Rik van de Westelaken]]. The season took place in [[Colombia]], the eighth country, and seventh season the series had filmed in the [[Americas]], following [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and the [[United States]] respectively. The season premiered on January 5, 2019. Live Finale aired on March 9, 2019 with simulcast in cinemas throughout the Netherlands. During the Finale, Sarah Chronis was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac10,150.-. Chronis, alongside her runner-up Niels Littooij, had successfully unmasked Merel Westrik as the Mole of 2019.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Colombia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nJokers, collectible tokens in the series that could correct wrong answers in test, were adapted with for this season. Throughout the season, any Jokers the candidates earned in assignments could be split open to potentially find an Exemption. However, if a Joker is split open, they become void regardless of holding an Exemption or not. Another twist occurred later in the season, where the candidates could gamble in an assignment to earn Jokers or have their next test time reduced to one second. The risk was that they could lose money for the pot, or if they're unlucky enough, two candidates would be executed from the game at the next Execution Ceremony. Some of the candidates lost in their gamble, which caused the second instance in the series' history where two candidates were executed from the game in the same Execution ceremony, the last of which occurred in Season 5.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Merel Westrik]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|17\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|[[Sarah Chronis]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|17\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Nielson|Niels Littooij]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|17\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Sinan Can|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Rick Paul van Mulligen|nl}}\n|rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center\"|12\n|rowspan=2|4th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Jamie Trenit\u00e9|nl}}\n|-\n|{{ill|Rob\u00e8rt van Beckhoven|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|10\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Evelien de Bruijn|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|8\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[NikkieTutorials|Nikkie de Jager]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|5\n|8th place\n|-\n|[[Evi Hanssen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|9th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

Attached to the bridge by rope were 15 chests being dragged by the river current. Ten of these chests held an Exemption for each of the candidates. In 20 minutes, the candidates must retrieve as many chests out of the river and onto the bridge.\n\nAfter the assignment was over, Rik approached the candidates with an offer. \u20ac2,500.- for the group's pot in exchange for all the exemptions the group managed to retrieve in the assignment. Rik also informed the group that if the non-exempt candidates all receive Green Screens, then everyone would proceed to the next episode. The candidates would only find out who had earned exemptions at the first Execution ceremony, if they reject Rik's offer.\n\nThe group rejected Rik's offer at the Execution ceremony, and it was revealed that Evelien, Evi, Merel, and Nikkie were the candidates to receive exemptions. The group earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'In Zicht' (In Sight) - Max. \u20ac1,000.-\nThe candidates arrived at a public square with a large group of Salsa dancers performing. Rik informed the group to pay attention to the next performance, during which the candidates were brought in to dance with the performers. After the performance had finished, Rik instructed the candidates that they had a minute to tap their partner that they just danced with. For every correct match, the group would earn \u20ac100.- for the pot.\n\n\u20ac1,000.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Rondje Om De Kerk' (Around the Church) - Max. \u20ac1,800.-\nHidden throughout the town of Santa Fe were five envelopes with a combined total of \u20ac1,800.- for the candidates to find. Using bicycles, they must cycle around the town to find the envelopes. Each bicycle had a tablet attached behind the seat, which displayed the location of the envelopes, which candidates needed to be at the envelope when its collected, and at what time. The tablets would only display the information while their respective bicycles are moving. Any envelopes that are collected by the wrong candidates or at the wrong time do not add money to the pot.\n\n\u20ac300.- was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 2 - Uitgerekend===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 2 - Uitgerekend\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 12 January 2019<br>Locations: [[Medell\u00edn|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Scattered around the courtyard are barrels with questions based upon their personal information. Eight candidates must manoeuvre a large wooden block over a board to reveal the numerical answer to each question. The remaining two candidates are stationed on a tower above the courtyard and must take photos of each answer the group presents to them. For every correct and readable answer presented to Rik, \u20ac150.- is added to the pot.\n\n\u20ac300.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Uit Stralen' (Out Shine) - Max. \u20ac3,500.-\nThe annual Laser game assignment, one by one, each candidate must navigate through a laser labyrinth, traversing on balance beams to safety platforms to pick up money that is assigned to them. The candidates have ten minutes in the labyrinth, however, if they are struck by a laser, them and the money they collect are out of the assignment.\n\n\u20ac650.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Wachtkamer?' (Waiting Room?) - Max. \u20ac2,500.-\nThe candidates are dividing up into two rooms of duos, and two rooms of trios at the [[University of Antioquia]] and to watch films on one screen, and live feeds of the other rooms on a second screen. The films are recordings of the candidates' confessionals where the production had made a series of offers to them. Intervals between confessionals saw offers appear on the film screen offering money for the pot, or Jokers. Each rooms' offers differed from one another, but the candidates could not contact the other rooms during the assignment outside of the livefeeds. Once a candidate has left their room, they are out of the assignment and can not accept any other offers in the assignment. If the candidates remain in their rooms until the end of the film, they lose \u20ac250.- per candidate still watching.\n\n\u20ac250.- was removed from the pot.\n\nAfter the assignments, Rik informed the candidates that some of the Jokers this season had exemptions hidden inside of them. At any point, they could use a chisel and hammer to split open their Joker to find out if they held an Exemption. If they break their Joker, the Joker becomes void regardless of its contents or lack thereof.\n\n===Episode 3 - Niet Gered===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 3 - Niet Gered\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 19 January 2019<br>Locations: [[Medell\u00edn|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Rik assigns each of the group a word in Spanish to help with the assignment. Evelien and Jamie, two candidates who were fluent in Spanish, were removed from the group for the assignment. Rik asks them to predict if the rest of the group will fill up six or more clothing lines, or five or less. If Evelien and Jamie guess correctly, the group earns \u20ac1,500.- for the pot.\n\nEvelien and Jamie guessed incorrectly and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Jokers Buyout'\nBefore the start of Stapelgek, Rik offered a single Joker to the candidates for \u20ac2,000.- from the pot, or it could be free. If the group manages to decide who receives the Joker within two minutes, nothing is removed from the pot.\n\nThe group selected Niels to receive the Joker, therefore nothing was removed from the pot.\n\n;'Stapelgek' (Crazy)\nAfter Niels accepts the Joker from Rik, he is instructed to separate himself from the rest of the candidates for the remainder of the assignment at [[Plaza Mayor, Medell\u00edn|Plaza Mayor]]. The rest must compete against each other in a match of [[Jenga]] to earn Jokers. Taking turns, each candidate must build their jokers by taking out pieces from their Jenga towers. The candidate that ends up causing their match's Jenga tower to fall, loses all Jokers they could have earned while the winner keeps theirs. Three corresponding pieces make a set of Jokers, ranging from one to three. The assignment ends when the last match is complete.\n\n;'Op Treden' (Performance) - Max. \u20ac2,500.-\nTaken to an abandoned Trainyard, the candidates are shown a giant 3D wooden puzzle standing before a series of barriers. The goal is for the 3D puzzle to be carried through the barriers and rebuild on the opposite side for one candidate to climb upon and claim the money. Rik gives the candidates the option to complete the assignment in under 45 minutes for \u20ac1,500.- or under 30 minutes for \u20ac2,500.-.\n\nThe group accomplished the assignment under 27 minutes, despite going for the 45-minute time limit. \u20ac1,500.- was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 4 - Drukker Worden===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 4 - Drukker Worden\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 26 January 2019<br>Locations: [[Medell\u00edn|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]] - [[Guatap\u00e9|Guatap\u00e9, Colombia]] - [[San Gil|San Gil, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

The other three duos are locked in caged that are towed along the lake from the start to finish. The caged duos have 35 minutes to escape their cages and return to the green start flags to earn money for the pot. If a caged duo either cannot escape before they are towed across the red finish line, or once freed return through the red finish flags, the amount their boat is worth is removed from the pot. The longer time spent in the cages before being freed, the higher amount of money the caged boats are worth. The rescue boat duo had to relay the codes on the outside of the cages to the caged duos.\n\n\u20ac500.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Serenade' - Max. \u20ac1,500.-\nArriving at their Hotel in San Gil, the candidates were placed across four different floors.

The candidates had to answer all the questions, using the answers written all over their jumpsuits in 15 minutes. As there were only seven jumpsuits, one candidate was available to assist in reading anyone's jumpsuit. Every correct answer added \u20ac50.- for the pot, however, if the candidates enter the wrong answer or incorrect spelling onto a tablet, they would earn \u20ac0.- and couldn't answer anymore questions on that tablet.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 5 - Verblindend===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 5 - Verblindend\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 2 February 2019<br>Locations: [[Barichara|Barichara, Colombia]] - [[San Gil|San Gil, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Five-letter words earned \u20ac50.-; six-letter words earned \u20ac100.-; and seven-letter words earned \u20ac200.- for the pot. In 45 minutes, the five candidates on the ground can drive the cars, and replace vowels on certain cars, to help the candidates on the tower to form their words.\n\n\u20ac1,350.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Sleutelhanger' (Keychain) - Max. \u20ac1,500.-\nAt the bottom of a local waterfall, the candidates must abseil down to reach two sets of locked boxes. In two teams, the candidates have to feel and memorize their team's corresponding knotted sticks in containers along the abseil for their box's combination lock. Once the two teams have abseiled down to their boxes, each team has one chance to open their box to earn money for the pot. Sinan pulled out of the assignment before it began due to concerns of his weight in the abseil, leaving one team with 2 candidates and the other with 4 candidates.\n\n\u20ac750.- was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 6 - Uithalen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 6 - Uithalen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 9 February 2019<br>Locations: [[San Gil|San Gil, Colombia]] - [[Curit\u00ed|Curit\u00ed, Colombia]] - [[Barichara|Barichara, Colombia]] - [[San Gil|San Gil, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

If they don't, the contents in the envelopes is removed from the pot. An additional restriction is that two candidates can only make left turns, another two could only make right turns, and the last two could only make left-right turns in that order. After the first 15 minutes, the candidates had to stop where they were, and wait for Rik's second location to repeat the assignment for another 15 minutes. All valid envelopes at the end of both assignments adds to the pot, and all invalid envelopes removes money from the pot.\n\n\u20ac100.- was removed from the pot.\n\n;'Reddingslijn' (Lifeline)\nAfter writing the test, Rik instructed the candidates to split into two sets of trios, informing them that each trio could prevent the other from seeing their results for the test. Hanging across a zipline above San Gil, each candidate had to cross the zipline and take note of the sequence of red and green screens along the line. At the end of their trio's respective zipline the candidates had to replicate the zipline sequence. If a trio were successful in replicating their group's sequence, the other trio would be exempt from the Execution. Again, Sinan pulled out of the assignment due to concerns for his safety due to his weight, and Niels refused based on his fear of heights, leaving both trios down a candidate to complete the assignment\n\nBoth teams succeeded in remembering their zipline sequence, and cancelled the episode's Execution ceremony.\n\n===Episode 7 - Inhalen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 7 - Inhalen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 16 February 2019<br>Locations: [[Barichara|Barichara, Colombia]] - [[Santa Marta|Santa Marta, Colombia]] - [[Dibulla, La Guajira|Dibulla, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Some of the boxes have money for the pot, while others have other temptations. Before they are allowed to walk the route, Rik gives them a choice between one, two and three Jokers or the ability to have their upcoming test's time be reduced to one second. Choosing one of the four options meant the candidate had to take with them one, two, three or four envelopes with misfortunes, respectively. These envelopes contain \u20ac0.-; -\u20ac500.-; -\u20ac1,000.-; or there will be two Executions at the upcoming test. Once their choice is made, the corresponding positive and negative letters are randomly placed along the route amidst the money for the pot.

Using a drone, one of the candidates can assist in directing the others to the correct barrels to collect the money. While the candidates are out in the field, they are tracked down by hunters. Any money in a candidate's possession is removed from the assignment if they are caught by the hunters outside of the safe zone.

Taking turns, each candidate could take out a single pin on the board.

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2019. This was the first season with new host and former winner, [[Rik van de Westelaken]]. The season took place in [[Colombia]], the eighth country, and seventh season the series had filmed in the [[Americas]], following [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and the [[United States]] respectively. The season premiered on January 5, 2019. Live Finale aired on March 9, 2019 with simulcast in cinemas throughout the Netherlands. During the Finale, Sarah Chronis was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac10,150.-. Chronis, alongside her runner-up Niels Littooij, had successfully unmasked Merel Westrik as the Mole of 2019.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Colombia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nJokers, collectible tokens in the series that could correct wrong answers in test, were adapted with for this season. Throughout the season, any Jokers the candidates earned in assignments could be split open to potentially find an Exemption. However, if a Joker is split open, they become void regardless of holding an Exemption or not. Another twist occurred later in the season, where the candidates could gamble in an assignment to earn Jokers or have their next test time reduced to one second. The risk was that they could lose money for the pot, or if they're unlucky enough, two candidates would be executed from the game at the next Execution Ceremony. Some of the candidates lost in their gamble, which caused the second instance in the series' history where two candidates were executed from the game in the same Execution ceremony, the last of which occurred in Season 5.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Merel Westrik]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|17\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|[[Sarah Chronis]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|17\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Nielson|Niels Littooij]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|17\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Sinan Can|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Rick Paul van Mulligen|nl}}\n|rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center\"|12\n|rowspan=2|4th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Jamie Trenit\u00e9|nl}}\n|-\n|{{ill|Rob\u00e8rt van Beckhoven|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|10\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Evelien de Bruijn|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|8\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[NikkieTutorials|Nikkie de Jager]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|5\n|8th place\n|-\n|[[Evi Hanssen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|9th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

Attached to the bridge by rope were 15 chests being dragged by the river current. Ten of these chests held an Exemption for each of the candidates. In 20 minutes, the candidates must retrieve as many chests out of the river and onto the bridge.\n\nAfter the assignment was over, Rik approached the candidates with an offer. \u20ac2,500.- for the group's pot in exchange for all the exemptions the group managed to retrieve in the assignment. Rik also informed the group that if the non-exempt candidates all receive Green Screens, then everyone would proceed to the next episode. The candidates would only find out who had earned exemptions at the first Execution ceremony, if they reject Rik's offer.\n\nThe group rejected Rik's offer at the Execution ceremony, and it was revealed that Evelien, Evi, Merel, and Nikkie were the candidates to receive exemptions. The group earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'In Zicht' (In Sight) - Max. \u20ac1,000.-\nThe candidates arrived at a public square with a large group of Salsa dancers performing. Rik informed the group to pay attention to the next performance, during which the candidates were brought in to dance with the performers. After the performance had finished, Rik instructed the candidates that they had a minute to tap their partner that they just danced with. For every correct match, the group would earn \u20ac100.- for the pot.\n\n\u20ac1,000.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Rondje Om De Kerk' (Around the Church) - Max. \u20ac1,800.-\nHidden throughout the town of Santa Fe were five envelopes with a combined total of \u20ac1,800.- for the candidates to find. Using bicycles, they must cycle around the town to find the envelopes. Each bicycle had a tablet attached behind the seat, which displayed the location of the envelopes, which candidates needed to be at the envelope when its collected, and at what time. The tablets would only display the information while their respective bicycles are moving. Any envelopes that are collected by the wrong candidates or at the wrong time do not add money to the pot.\n\n\u20ac300.- was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 2 - Uitgerekend===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 2 - Uitgerekend\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 12 January 2019<br>Locations: [[Medell\u00edn|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Scattered around the courtyard are barrels with questions based upon their personal information. Eight candidates must manoeuvre a large wooden block over a board to reveal the numerical answer to each question. The remaining two candidates are stationed on a tower above the courtyard and must take photos of each answer the group presents to them. For every correct and readable answer presented to Rik, \u20ac150.- is added to the pot.\n\n\u20ac300.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Uit Stralen' (Out Shine) - Max. \u20ac3,500.-\nThe annual Laser game assignment, one by one, each candidate must navigate through a laser labyrinth, traversing on balance beams to safety platforms to pick up money that is assigned to them. The candidates have ten minutes in the labyrinth, however, if they are struck by a laser, them and the money they collect are out of the assignment.\n\n\u20ac650.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Wachtkamer?' (Waiting Room?) - Max. \u20ac2,500.-\nThe candidates are dividing up into two rooms of duos, and two rooms of trios at the [[University of Antioquia]] and to watch films on one screen, and live feeds of the other rooms on a second screen. The films are recordings of the candidates' confessionals where the production had made a series of offers to them. Intervals between confessionals saw offers appear on the film screen offering money for the pot, or Jokers. Each rooms' offers differed from one another, but the candidates could not contact the other rooms during the assignment outside of the livefeeds. Once a candidate has left their room, they are out of the assignment and can not accept any other offers in the assignment. If the candidates remain in their rooms until the end of the film, they lose \u20ac250.- per candidate still watching.\n\n\u20ac250.- was removed from the pot.\n\nAfter the assignments, Rik informed the candidates that some of the Jokers this season had exemptions hidden inside of them. At any point, they could use a chisel and hammer to split open their Joker to find out if they held an Exemption. If they break their Joker, the Joker becomes void regardless of its contents or lack thereof.\n\n===Episode 3 - Niet Gered===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 3 - Niet Gered\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 19 January 2019<br>Locations: [[Medell\u00edn|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Rik assigns each of the group a word in Spanish to help with the assignment. Evelien and Jamie, two candidates who were fluent in Spanish, were removed from the group for the assignment. Rik asks them to predict if the rest of the group will fill up six or more clothing lines, or five or less. If Evelien and Jamie guess correctly, the group earns \u20ac1,500.- for the pot.\n\nEvelien and Jamie guessed incorrectly and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Jokers Buyout'\nBefore the start of Stapelgek, Rik offered a single Joker to the candidates for \u20ac2,000.- from the pot, or it could be free. If the group manages to decide who receives the Joker within two minutes, nothing is removed from the pot.\n\nThe group selected Niels to receive the Joker, therefore nothing was removed from the pot.\n\n;'Stapelgek' (Crazy)\nAfter Niels accepts the Joker from Rik, he is instructed to separate himself from the rest of the candidates for the remainder of the assignment at [[Plaza Mayor, Medell\u00edn|Plaza Mayor]]. The rest must compete against each other in a match of [[Jenga]] to earn Jokers. Taking turns, each candidate must build their jokers by taking out pieces from their Jenga towers. The candidate that ends up causing their match's Jenga tower to fall, loses all Jokers they could have earned while the winner keeps theirs. Three corresponding pieces make a set of Jokers, ranging from one to three. The assignment ends when the last match is complete.\n\n;'Op Treden' (Performance) - Max. \u20ac2,500.-\nTaken to an abandoned Trainyard, the candidates are shown a giant 3D wooden puzzle standing before a series of barriers. The goal is for the 3D puzzle to be carried through the barriers and rebuild on the opposite side for one candidate to climb upon and claim the money. Rik gives the candidates the option to complete the assignment in under 45 minutes for \u20ac1,500.- or under 30 minutes for \u20ac2,500.-.\n\nThe group accomplished the assignment under 27 minutes, despite going for the 45-minute time limit. \u20ac1,500.- was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 4 - Drukker Worden===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 4 - Drukker Worden\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 26 January 2019<br>Locations: [[Medell\u00edn|Medell\u00edn, Colombia]] - [[Guatap\u00e9|Guatap\u00e9, Colombia]] - [[San Gil|San Gil, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

The other three duos are locked in caged that are towed along the lake from the start to finish. The caged duos have 35 minutes to escape their cages and return to the green start flags to earn money for the pot. If a caged duo either cannot escape before they are towed across the red finish line, or once freed return through the red finish flags, the amount their boat is worth is removed from the pot. The longer time spent in the cages before being freed, the higher amount of money the caged boats are worth. The rescue boat duo had to relay the codes on the outside of the cages to the caged duos.\n\n\u20ac500.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Serenade' - Max. \u20ac1,500.-\nArriving at their Hotel in San Gil, the candidates were placed across four different floors. With a local band performing a serenade from the adjacent balconies, the candidates had to find their correct balconies to be standing in by the time the band finishes their performance. On every balcony on the four floors had rules in which the candidates had to follow to find their correct rooms. If the candidates were successful, they would earn \u20ac1,500.- for the pot.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Koffiepedia' (Coffee-pedia) - Max. \u20ac2,000.-\nSpread throughout the grounds of a coffee farm, are four tablet stations with ten questions about coffee each. The candidates had to answer all the questions, using the answers written all over their jumpsuits in 15 minutes. As there were only seven jumpsuits, one candidate was available to assist in reading anyone's jumpsuit. Every correct answer added \u20ac50.- for the pot, however, if the candidates enter the wrong answer or incorrect spelling onto a tablet, they would earn \u20ac0.- and couldn't answer anymore questions on that tablet.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 5 - Verblindend===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 5 - Verblindend\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 2 February 2019<br>Locations: [[Barichara|Barichara, Colombia]] - [[San Gil|San Gil, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Each group were given envelopes with photographs of the locations to find the puzzle pieces. If the candidates manage to find all the pieces and solve the puzzles in 45 minutes, the candidates will accomplish the assignment.\n\n\u20ac1,800.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Parkeergeld' (Parking Fee)\nReturning to a driving school in San Gil, the candidates are shown seven training cars with letters on their roofs, with accompanying parking bays. With two candidates stationed in a tower above the school's courtyard, the group must make five, six, and seven-letter words in the parking bays. Five-letter words earned \u20ac50.-; six-letter words earned \u20ac100.-; and seven-letter words earned \u20ac200.- for the pot. In 45 minutes, the five candidates on the ground can drive the cars, and replace vowels on certain cars, to help the candidates on the tower to form their words.\n\n\u20ac1,350.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Sleutelhanger' (Keychain) - Max. \u20ac1,500.-\nAt the bottom of a local waterfall, the candidates must abseil down to reach two sets of locked boxes. In two teams, the candidates have to feel and memorize their team's corresponding knotted sticks in containers along the abseil for their box's combination lock. Once the two teams have abseiled down to their boxes, each team has one chance to open their box to earn money for the pot.

At the beginning of the assignment, each candidate must select two envelopes to carry with them. If they each arrive in time at Rik's location, whatever is in their envelopes is added to the pot. If they don't, the contents in the envelopes is removed from the pot. An additional restriction is that two candidates can only make left turns, another two could only make right turns, and the last two could only make left-right turns in that order. After the first 15 minutes, the candidates had to stop where they were, and wait for Rik's second location to repeat the assignment for another 15 minutes. All valid envelopes at the end of both assignments adds to the pot, and all invalid envelopes removes money from the pot.\n\n\u20ac100.- was removed from the pot.\n\n;'Reddingslijn' (Lifeline)\nAfter writing the test, Rik instructed the candidates to split into two sets of trios, informing them that each trio could prevent the other from seeing their results for the test. Hanging across a zipline above San Gil, each candidate had to cross the zipline and take note of the sequence of red and green screens along the line. At the end of their trio's respective zipline the candidates had to replicate the zipline sequence. If a trio were successful in replicating their group's sequence, the other trio would be exempt from the Execution. Again, Sinan pulled out of the assignment due to concerns for his safety due to his weight, and Niels refused based on his fear of heights, leaving both trios down a candidate to complete the assignment\n\nBoth teams succeeded in remembering their zipline sequence, and cancelled the episode's Execution ceremony.\n\n===Episode 7 - Inhalen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 7 - Inhalen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 16 February 2019<br>Locations: [[Barichara|Barichara, Colombia]] - [[Santa Marta|Santa Marta, Colombia]] - [[Dibulla, La Guajira|Dibulla, Colombia]]\n|-\n!

Some of the boxes have money for the pot, while others have other temptations. Before they are allowed to walk the route, Rik gives them a choice between one, two and three Jokers or the ability to have their upcoming test's time be reduced to one second. Choosing one of the four options meant the candidate had to take with them one, two, three or four envelopes with misfortunes, respectively. These envelopes contain \u20ac0.-; -\u20ac500.-; -\u20ac1,000.-; or there will be two Executions at the upcoming test. Once their choice is made, the corresponding positive and negative letters are randomly placed along the route amidst the money for the pot.

Across a deserted stretch of beach are oil barrels with money totaling up to \u20ac2,000.- attached to the tops. Using a drone, one of the candidates can assist in directing the others to the correct barrels to collect the money. While the candidates are out in the field, they are tracked down by hunters. Any money in a candidate's possession is removed from the assignment if they are caught by the hunters outside of the safe zone. The candidates have 30 minutes to complete the assignment, or until all the candidates are taken out by the hunters.\n\n\u20ac1,250.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Ten Val Brengen' (Overthrow)\nBefore the candidates could write their next test, Rik offered up a Joker to be won. Of the two that Rik held, one Joker hid the final Exemption of the season. After making the selection, the Joker is placed upon the top of a pinboard. Taking turns, each candidate could take out a single pin on the board. The candidate that takes out the pin that causes the Joker to fall into the bottom of the board, wins the Joker.\n\nNiels won the Joker and chose to split it open.

However, a tradition of introducing individual letters as heraldic charges on the basis of [[acrophony]] originates in the 15th to 16th century, primarily in personal and municipial heraldry, and with some frequency in the modern period, appearing more often on the continent than in British heraldry where letters as charges have traditionally been discouraged. Fox-Davies (1909:281) regarding letters of the alphabet as heraldic charges:\n:\"Instances of these are scarcely common, but the family of Kekitmore<ref>John Guillim, ''A Display of Heraldry'' (1780), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4FwzAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA295#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 295].</ref> may be adduced as bearing 'Gules, three [[S]]'s or,' while [[Bridlington Priory]] had for arms 'Per pale, sable and argent, three [[B]]'s countercharged.' [...] Corporate arms (in England) afford an instance of alphabetical letters in the case of the B's on the shield of [[Bermondsey]].\"\n\nOne of the earliest instances of the use of letters as heraldic charges is that of the Langenmantel family of [[Augsburg]]. R\u00fcdiger I Langenmantel (d. 1342), one of the leading figures of the Augsburg patriciate during the first four decades of the 14th century, is the founder of the \"Langenmantel vom RR\" branch of the family, derived from his coat of arms showing two letters [[R]] (for his given name), shown [[Attitude_(heraldry)#Addorsed|addorsed]] (as mirror images).<ref>Ernst Heinrich Kneschke, ''Neues allgemeines deutsches Adelslexikon'', vol. 5, Leipzig, (1864),388f.</ref>\n\nReligious symbolism:\n*[[Shield of the Trinity|Emblem of the Trinity]]<ref>''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'' by A.C.

One cannot usefully make a book on armory assume the character of a general encyclopedia on useful knowledge, and reference will only be made in this chapter to a limited number, including those which from frequent usage have obtained a recognised heraldic character.\"\n\n===Crosses===\n{{main|Heraldic cross}}\nOriginally representing the [[Christian cross]] used as [[field sign]] and [[War flag|standard]] during the [[Crusades]], heraldic crosses diversified into many variants in the late medieval to early modern period, the most common (besides the plain \"[[Greek cross]]\") being the [[cross potent]], [[cross patt\u00e9e]], [[cross fleury]], [[cross moline]], [[cross crosslet]] (etc.).\n\n===Lettering{{anchor|Letters}}===\n{{commonscat|Letters in heraldry}}\n[[File:Langmantel Siebmacher207 - Augsburg.jpg|thumb|upright|''Langenmantel vom RR'' family coat of arms as shown in ''[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]]'' (1605).]]\nLettering in coats of arms are usually placed in the [[heraldic motto|motto]], not in the heraldic shield as a charge. However, a tradition of introducing individual letters as heraldic charges on the basis of [[acrophony]] originates in the 15th to 16th century, primarily in personal and municipial heraldry, and with some frequency in the modern period, appearing more often on the continent than in British heraldry where letters as charges have traditionally been discouraged. Fox-Davies (1909:281) regarding letters of the alphabet as heraldic charges:\n:\"Instances of these are scarcely common, but the family of Kekitmore<ref>John Guillim, ''A Display of Heraldry'' (1780), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4FwzAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA295#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 295].</ref> may be adduced as bearing 'Gules, three [[S]]'s or,' while [[Bridlington Priory]] had for arms 'Per pale, sable and argent, three [[B]]'s countercharged.' [...] Corporate arms (in England) afford an instance of alphabetical letters in the case of the B's on the shield of [[Bermondsey]].\"\n\nOne of the earliest instances of the use of letters as heraldic charges is that of the Langenmantel family of [[Augsburg]]. R\u00fcdiger I Langenmantel (d. 1342), one of the leading figures of the Augsburg patriciate during the first four decades of the 14th century, is the founder of the \"Langenmantel vom RR\" branch of the family, derived from his coat of arms showing two letters [[R]] (for his given name), shown [[Attitude_(heraldry)#Addorsed|addorsed]] (as mirror images).<ref>Ernst Heinrich Kneschke, ''Neues allgemeines deutsches Adelslexikon'', vol. 5, Leipzig, (1864),388f.</ref>\n\nReligious symbolism:\n*[[Shield of the Trinity|Emblem of the Trinity]]<ref>''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'' by A.C.

Macedonia), has participated in the '''Eurovision Song Contest''' 19 times since its official debut in  [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]]. The country had attempted to participate in 1996, but failed to qualify from the audio-only qualifying round. The current Head of Delegation is Meri Popova.\n\nPrior to 2019, North Macedonia's best result was a 12th-place finish with [[Elena Risteska]] in {{escyr|2006}}. Having qualified from the semi-final round only once in ten of the previous eleven contests (2008\u201318), North Macedonia achieved its best result to date in {{escyr|2019}}, when [[Tamara Todevska]] qualified and finished in seventh place in the final after winning the jury vote.\n\n==History==\nPrior declaring independence in 1991, as a [[Country|constituent country]] of [[SFR Yugoslavia]], the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] participated in the [[Yugoslavian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest|Yugoslav pre-selection]] called among the other Yugoslav federal units.<ref name=\"Yu-local-selection\">[http://free-st.t-com.hr/eurodalmatia/statistika.htm '''Opatijo, oh Fabulous''' - Yugoslavian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest - statistics by year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226123401/http://free-st.t-com.hr/eurodalmatia/statistika.htm |date=2008-02-26 }}, ''Eurodalmatia'' official ESC [[fan club]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]]</ref>  Also, Macedonian composers wrote songs for candidates from other parts of Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"macogae\">[http://www.macedonia.ogae.net Official Site] of [[OGAE]] Macedonia, see section: ''Jugovizija''. <!--direct link not possible as its flash, find the section manually on the left after the page its loaded--></ref> However, the Macedonian entries never managed to win, and the SR Macedonia was the only federal state never to send a Yugoslav entry to the Eurovision Song Contest. An exception occurred when [[Maja Od\u017eaklievska]] won the Yugoslav competition in 1979,<ref name=\"Yu-local-selection\"/>  but she did not perform in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979]] due to the [[Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Yugoslavian]] decision not to participate that year.\n\nAs the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia), the country submitted its first entry, \"Samo ti\" (\u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e \u0442\u0438) sung by [[Kaliopi]], for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996 edition]]. However, the country failed to qualify through the non-broadcast pre-selection round.  Its efforts to enter the contest were again hindered in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]], when another new system was introduced where countries with the lowest average scores over the previous four years were excluded from participating. The country made its debut in 1998, with [[Vlado Janevski]]'s \"[[Ne zori, zoro]]\".\n\nThe country's best result before 2019 (and the best result with its old name) was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]], when [[Elena Risteska]] sang \"[[Ninanajna]]\" (\u041d\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0458\u043d\u0430) in [[Athens]], [[Greece]] and came 12th. It is the only country to have qualified from every semi-final from 2004 to 2007 (other countries have qualified for every final but due to them finishing in the top 10 the previous year, they did not have to compete in the semi-final). Despite never finishing in the top 10, their record of qualifying for every final was only broken in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], when the jury vote used in the semi-final chose [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] as a finalist, despite [[Tamara Todevska|Tamara]], [[Vr\u010dak]] and [[Adrian Gaxha|Adrian]] having come 10th in the televote. Since then, only in 2012 did they make the final. \n\n[[Macedonian Radio-Television|Macedonian Radio-Television (MRT)]], which broadcasts the event, has used the [[Skopje Fest]] festival to select the national entry since the country's debut, although it made several changes in the national final format, so the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2012 national finals were organised outside the Skopje Festival.\n\nFor [[Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]], the country competed for the first time under its new name, North Macedonia. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2019/03/06/north-macedonia-ebu-confirms-name/|title=North Macedonia: EBU Confirms Name Change|first=Emily|last=Herbert|date=6 March 2019|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2019}}</ref> MRT selected [[Tamara Todevska]] as their act of choice, performing the song \"[[Proud (Tamara Todevska song)|Proud]]\". The song managed to qualify through the second semifinal, and reached seventh place in the final, winning the international jury vote. This is the first top ten placement for the country, and also broke the record as the highest place ever for North Macedonia in the history of the contest.\n\nNorth Macedonia are one of the least successful countries in the contest, as well as a recent six-year non-qualification streak (2013-2018), and failing to qualify in ten of the twelve most recent contests.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n== Contestants ==\n{{for|contestants prior to 1996|Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#A4EAA9|{{center|{{small|{{Abbr|W.|Withdrew}}}}}}\n|Withdrew/disqualified\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1996}}}}{{Efn|North Macedonia unsuccessfully attempted to participate in 1996, when there was an audio-only pre-qualifying round for all countries (excluding hosts Norway).

Macedonia), has participated in the '''Eurovision Song Contest''' 19 times since its official debut in  [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]]. The country had attempted to participate in 1996, but failed to qualify from the audio-only qualifying round. The current Head of Delegation is Meri Popova.\n\nPrior to 2019, North Macedonia's best result was a 12th-place finish with [[Elena Risteska]] in {{escyr|2006}}. Having qualified from the semi-final round only once in ten of the previous eleven contests (2008\u201318), North Macedonia achieved its best result to date in {{escyr|2019}}, when [[Tamara Todevska]] qualified and finished in seventh place in the final after winning the jury vote.\n\n==History==\nPrior declaring independence in 1991, as a [[Country|constituent country]] of [[SFR Yugoslavia]], the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] participated in the [[Yugoslavian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest|Yugoslav pre-selection]] called among the other Yugoslav federal units.<ref name=\"Yu-local-selection\">[http://free-st.t-com.hr/eurodalmatia/statistika.htm '''Opatijo, oh Fabulous''' - Yugoslavian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest - statistics by year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226123401/http://free-st.t-com.hr/eurodalmatia/statistika.htm |date=2008-02-26 }}, ''Eurodalmatia'' official ESC [[fan club]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]]</ref>  Also, Macedonian composers wrote songs for candidates from other parts of Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"macogae\">[http://www.macedonia.ogae.net Official Site] of [[OGAE]] Macedonia, see section: ''Jugovizija''. <!--direct link not possible as its flash, find the section manually on the left after the page its loaded--></ref> However, the Macedonian entries never managed to win, and the SR Macedonia was the only federal state never to send a Yugoslav entry to the Eurovision Song Contest. An exception occurred when [[Maja Od\u017eaklievska]] won the Yugoslav competition in 1979,<ref name=\"Yu-local-selection\"/>  but she did not perform in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979]] due to the [[Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Yugoslavian]] decision not to participate that year.\n\nAs the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia), the country submitted its first entry, \"Samo ti\" (\u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e \u0442\u0438) sung by [[Kaliopi]], for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996 edition]]. However, the country failed to qualify through the non-broadcast pre-selection round.  Its efforts to enter the contest were again hindered in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]], when another new system was introduced where countries with the lowest average scores over the previous four years were excluded from participating. The country made its debut in 1998, with [[Vlado Janevski]]'s \"[[Ne zori, zoro]]\".\n\nThe country's best result before 2019 (and the best result with its old name) was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]], when [[Elena Risteska]] sang \"[[Ninanajna]]\" (\u041d\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0458\u043d\u0430) in [[Athens]], [[Greece]] and came 12th. It is the only country to have qualified from every semi-final from 2004 to 2007 (other countries have qualified for every final but due to them finishing in the top 10 the previous year, they did not have to compete in the semi-final). Despite never finishing in the top 10, their record of qualifying for every final was only broken in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], when the jury vote used in the semi-final chose [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] as a finalist, despite [[Tamara Todevska|Tamara]], [[Vr\u010dak]] and [[Adrian Gaxha|Adrian]] having come 10th in the televote. Since then, only in 2012 did they make the final. \n\n[[Macedonian Radio-Television|Macedonian Radio-Television (MRT)]], which broadcasts the event, has used the [[Skopje Fest]] festival to select the national entry since the country's debut, although it made several changes in the national final format, so the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2012 national finals were organised outside the Skopje Festival.\n\nFor [[Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]], the country competed for the first time under its new name, North Macedonia. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovoix.com/2019/03/06/north-macedonia-ebu-confirms-name/|title=North Macedonia: EBU Confirms Name Change|first=Emily|last=Herbert|date=6 March 2019|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2019}}</ref> MRT selected [[Tamara Todevska]] as their act of choice, performing the song \"[[Proud (Tamara Todevska song)|Proud]]\". The song managed to qualify through the second semifinal, and reached seventh place in the final, winning the international jury vote. This is the first top ten placement for the country, and also broke the record as the highest place ever for North Macedonia in the history of the contest.\n\nNorth Macedonia are one of the least successful countries in the contest, as well as a recent six-year non-qualification streak (2013-2018), and failing to qualify in ten of the twelve most recent contests.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n== Contestants ==\n{{for|contestants prior to 1996|Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#A4EAA9|{{small|{{center|{{Abbr|W.|Withdrew}}}}}}\n|Withdrew/disqualified\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1996}}}}{{Efn|North Macedonia unsuccessfully attempted to participate in 1996, when there was an audio-only pre-qualifying round for all countries (excluding hosts Norway).

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2018. This was the last season with current, and longest running host, [[Art Rooijakkers]]. The season took place in [[Georgia (Country)|Georgia]], the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union State]]. The season premiered on January 6, 2018. The Live Finale aired on March 10, 2018 from the [[Vondelpark|VondelCS pavilion]]. During the Finale, Ruben Hein was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac17,750.-. Hein had successfully unmasked [[Jan Versteegh]] as the Mole of 2018, outwitting his fellow finalist, [[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]].\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe season began with the candidates unknowingly scattered in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine for the first assignment to discover where the host country of the season will be, Georgia. This season also had a candidate quit in the season for the upkeep of their mental health; a series' first compared to previous medical evacuations and withdrawals. The season also changed the unmasking of the Mole. Where after the final test had been written, the finalists were informed that they would find out who the Mole is along with the rest of the Netherlands at the Live Finale. Typically the finalists would be informed of the Mole immediately after the final test and the secret would remain until the unmasking during the Live Finale broadcast.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Jan Versteegh]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Ruben Hein|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Simone Weimans|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Stine Jensen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 13\n|4th place\n|-\n|[[Loes Haverkort]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 9\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Emilio Guzman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 7\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Bella Hay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[Jean-Marc van Tol]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|Quit\n|-\n|{{ill|Ron Boszhard|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 1\n|8th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

The candidates have 30 minutes to find each telescope and point them at the moon. They can call Art at any moment to check their work. If the candidates get all three telescopes pointing to the moon, they would earn \u20ac1,000.- for the pot.\n\nThe candidates completed the assignment, and \u20ac1,000.- was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Verbergen (Hide) - Max. \u20ac1,500.-'''\nArriving at a small lakeside town of Tabatskuri, the finalists were tasked to drive along three different routes in Jeeps. Along their routes would be posts with two puzzle pieces hanging on them, and a question to help the candidates pick the correct one. Having only correct puzzle pieces would provide directions to where the candidates could find money in the region. The finalists had one hour to find the money at the end of their routes.\n\nThe finalists failed the assignment, and nothing was added to the pot.\n\n'''The Final Test - Max. \u20ac5,000.-'''\nAwaiting the finalists at the bottom of Rabati Castle in Akhaltsikhe, Art informed each of them that they had an option to add money to the pot one last time. As soon as they entered the Castle, they had to follow signs leading them to where their final test would be written. Two longer, diverting routes would lead the finalists to \u20ac2,500.- that they could add to the pot, or to see the Mole at the end of the longest route. However, their time for the test starts as soon as they enter the castle, so the diversions cost time on their final test.\n\nThe final amount earned for the winner's pot would be revealed during the Live Finale, where for the first time in the series' history would include the unmasking of the Mole in front of the live audience, 167 days after the final day of filming.\n\n===Episode 10 - Finale===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 10 - Finale\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 10/03/2018<br>Locations: [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, Netherlands]] \n|-\n!

Jan, Ruben, and Olcay arrived at Vondelpark for a final debriefing by Art. At first, Art revealed that Olcay was not the Mole nor the winner, before Jan Versteegh finally stepped forward to reveal himself as the Mole. During the reunion after the unmasking, the executed candidates revealed that it was Olcay who misled them into thinking Ruben was the Mole. Meanwhile, Ruben only started to catch onto Jan as the Mole when Loes and Stine, his two main suspects were executed one after the other. In the Final Test, Olcay answered her test thinking Ruben was the Mole, and ultimately had no chance in beating Ruben. During the Final Test, Olcay skipped past the Money and Mole route, as she got lost and took too much time getting to the test. While both Jan and Ruben grabbed the extra \u20ac2,500.-. With Jan being the Mole, his \u20ac2,500.- was to fool the audiences, and it was not added to the final winner's pot of \u20ac17,750.-.\n\n==Mole Sabotage==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Hidden Clues==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Viewing Figures===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"| Viewing Figures\n|-\n! #\n!

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2018. This was the last season with current, and longest running host, [[Art Rooijakkers]]. The season took place in [[Georgia (Country)|Georgia]], the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union State]]. The season premiered on January 6, 2018. The Live Finale aired on March 10, 2018 from the [[Vondelpark|VondelCS pavilion]]. During the Finale, Ruben Hein was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac17,750.-. Hein had successfully unmasked [[Jan Versteegh]] as the Mole of 2018, outwitting his fellow finalist, [[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]].\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe season began with the candidates unknowingly scattered in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine for the first assignment to discover where the host country of the season will be, Georgia. This season also had a candidate quit in the season for the upkeep of their mental health; a series' first compared to previous medical evacuations and withdrawals. The season also changed the unmasking of the Mole. Where after the final test had been written, the finalists were informed that they would find out who the Mole is along with the rest of the Netherlands at the Live Finale. Typically the finalists would be informed of the Mole immediately after the final test and the secret would remain until the unmasking during the Live Finale broadcast.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Jan Versteegh]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Ruben Hein|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Simone Weimans|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Stine Jensen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 13\n|4th place\n|-\n|[[Loes Haverkort]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 9\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Emilio Guzman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 7\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Bella Hay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[Jean-Marc van Tol]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|Quit\n|-\n|{{ill|Ron Boszhard|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 1\n|8th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

However, their time for the test starts as soon as they enter the castle, so the diversions cost time on their final test.\n\nThe final amount earned for the winner's pot would be revealed during the Live Finale, where for the first time in the series' history would include the unmasking of the Mole in front of the live audience, 167 days after the final day of filming.\n\n===Episode 10 - Finale===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 10 - Finale\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 10/03/2018<br>Locations: [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, Netherlands]] \n|-\n!

Jan, Ruben, and Olcay arrived at Vondelpark for a final debriefing by Art. At first, Art revealed that Olcay was not the Mole nor the winner, before Jan Versteegh finally stepped forward to reveal himself as the Mole. During the reunion after the unmasking, the executed candidates revealed that it was Olcay who misled them into thinking Ruben was the Mole. Meanwhile, Ruben only started to catch onto Jan as the Mole when Loes and Stine, his two main suspects were executed one after the other. In the Final Test, Olcay answered her test thinking Ruben was the Mole, and ultimately had no chance in beating Ruben. During the Final Test, Olcay skipped past the Money and Mole route, as she got lost and took too much time getting to the test. While both Jan and Ruben grabbed the extra \u20ac2,500.-. With Jan being the Mole, his \u20ac2,500.- was to fool the audiences, and it was not added to the final winner's pot of \u20ac17,750.-.\n\n==Mole Sabotage==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Hidden Clues==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\n==Viewing Figures==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"| Viewing Figures\n|-\n! #\n!

Since then it has missed five contests ({{escyr|1970}}, {{escyr|2000}}, {{escyr|2002}}, {{escyr|2013}} and {{escyr|2016}}). The contest is broadcast in Portugal by [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal]] (RTP). Portugal won the contest for the first time in {{escyr|2017}} and hosted the {{escyr|2018}} contest in [[Lisbon]].\n\nPortugal finished last on its debut in 1964 and again in {{escyr|1974}}, before achieving its best result of the 20th century in {{escyr|1996}}, with [[L\u00facia Moniz]] finishing sixth. The country then finished last for the third time in {{escyr|1997}}. Having not appeared in the final since {{escyr|2010}} and as holders of the record for most appearances in the contest without a win, Portugal won at the 49th attempt, when [[Salvador Sobral]] won the {{escyr|2017}} contest with the song \"[[Amar Pelos Dois]]\", Portugal's first top five result in the contest.  As hosts in 2018, the country finished last in the contest for the fourth time. In 2019, the country failed to qualify.\n\n==History==\nPortugal's debut entry was [[Ant\u00f3nio Calv\u00e1rio]] with \"[[Ora\u00e7\u00e3o]]\". It was not a successful debut for the country, with Calv\u00e1rio coming last in the contest. Since then, Portugal has come last on three further occasions, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]], when [[Paulo de Carvalho]] sang \"[[E depois do adeus]]\", in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]], when C\u00e9lia Lawson performed \"[[Antes do adeus]]\" and in {{escyr|2018}} as a host country. Despite its last-place finish in the contest, \"E depois do adeus\" gained notability for being used as the radio musical signal to begin the [[Carnation Revolution]] against the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, being played at 22:55 on the 24th of April, 1974.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYVONDlu-Zs The Eurovision song that made Portuguese history - second Semi-Final - Eurovision 2018, Official Youtube Eurovision Channel, 10.05.2018]</ref> Prior to their sixth-place finish for [[L\u00facia Moniz]], with the song \"[[O meu cora\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o tem cor]]\" in {{escyr|1996}}, Portugal's best result in the contest was two seventh-place finishes, for [[Carlos Mendes (singer)|Carlos Mendes]] in {{escyr|1972}} and [[Jos\u00e9 Cid]] in {{escyr|1980}}. Despite having some really weak results, the 90s were the most successful decade for the country, reaching the top 10 four times. Portugal had admission to take part in the 2000 and 2002 contest but refused. Its place was taken by Latvia both times, which ended up winning the contest in the latter year.\n\nSince semi-finals were introduced in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]], Portugal has failed to reach the final eight times, including from 2004 to 2007. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], [[V\u00e2nia Fernandes]] finished 13th with the song \"[[Senhora do mar (Negras \u00e1guas)|Senhora do Mar]],\" Portugal's best outcome since 1996. The country continued to be present in the final until 2010. In {{escyr|2017}}, Portugal reached the finals with [[Salvador Sobral]]'s entry, \"[[Amar pelos dois]]\", ending a 6-year non-appearance in the finals, as it did not participate in the contest in 2013 and 2016 and did not qualify for the finals in 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015, finally winning the contest for the first time ever, earning 758 points, setting the record for the highest number of points in the history of the [[Eurovision Song Contest|competition]], topping both the televoting and jury voting for the first time since {{Esccnty|Austria|y=2014}}'s \"[[Rise Like a Phoenix]]\" in {{Escyr|2014}}. It was the first winning song entirely performed in a country's native language since {{Esccnty|Serbia|y=2007}}'s \"[[Molitva]]\" in {{Escyr|2007}}. In {{escyr|2018}}, as a host country, Portugal came last for the fourth time in the contest, and for the first time in a non-joint last position. This was the third instance of a host country placing in the bottom 5 since {{escyr|2015}}.\n\n== Absences ==\nPortugal has been absent from five contests since their first participation. The country's first absence was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1970|1970]], where Portugal, along with four other countries, boycotted the contest due to the result of the previous year, when four countries were announced the winner.<ref name=\"Official History\">O'Connor, John Kennedy.

It is one of the longest-running Eurovision selection methods. Previously a number of regional juries selected the winner, however recently the winner has been selected through televoting. In 2009, 2010, 2017, 2018 and 2019 a 50-50 system between district juries and televote (like in the ESC) has been used.\n\nIn the years when Portugal does not participate in the contest, the Festival da Can\u00e7\u00e3o was not held, except in two occasions: in 1970, when Portugal boycotted the contest, and in 2000.\n\n== Contestants ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#87A96B|{{center|{{small|{{Abbr|W.|Withdrew}}}}}}\n|Withdrew/disqualified\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-bgcolor=\"#fe8080\"\n!{{Escyr|1964}}\n|[[Ant\u00f3nio Calv\u00e1rio]]\n|[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]\n|\"[[Ora\u00e7\u00e3o]]\"\n|align=center|13 \u25c1\n|align=center|0\n|rowspan=\"29\" colspan =\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1965}}\n|[[Simone de Oliveira]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Sol de inverno]]\"\n|align=center|13\n|align=center|1 \n|-\n!{{Escyr|1966}}\n|[[Madalena Igl\u00e9sias]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Ele e ela]]\"\n|align=center|13\n|align=center|6\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1967}}\n|[[Eduardo Nascimento]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[O vento mudou]]\"\n|align=center|12\n|align=center|3\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1968}}\n|[[Carlos Mendes (singer)|Carlos Mendes]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Ver\u00e3o]]\"\n|align=center|11\n|align=center|5\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1969}}\n|[[Simone de Oliveira]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Desfolhada portuguesa]]\"\n|align=center|15\n|align=center|4\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1970}}}}\n|colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1971}}\n|[[Tonicha]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Menina do alto da serra]]\"\n|align=center|9\n|align=center|83\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1972}}\n|[[Carlos Mendes (singer)|Carlos Mendes]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[A festa da vida]]\"\n|align=center|7\n|align=center|90\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1973}}\n|[[Fernando Tordo]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Tourada]]\"\n|align=center|10 \n|align=center|80\n|-bgcolor=\"#fe8080\" \n!{{Escyr|1974}}\n|[[Paulo de Carvalho]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[E depois do adeus]]\"\n|align=center|14 \u25c1\n|align=center|3\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1975}}\n|[[Duarte Mendes]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Madrugada (song)|Madrugada]]\"\n|align=center|16\n|align=center|16\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1976}}\n|[[Carlos do Carmo]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Uma flor de verde pinho]]\"\n|align=center|12\n|align=center|24\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1977}}\n|[[Os Amigos]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Portugal no cora\u00e7\u00e3o]]\"\n|align=center|14\n|align=center|18{{Efn|During the voting sequence of the live show, several errors were made in the announcement of the scores, which were then adjusted after the broadcast.

and comedian [[Steve Coogan]] created the character ''\"Tony Ferrino\"'' for his television comedy series. ''\"Tony Ferrino\"'' is supposedly a Portuguese singer and winner of the Eurovision Song Contest; he is a stereotype based on singers and entertainers often seen on European television programmes in the 1970s and 1980s. The [[BBC]] produced a one-off programme ''The Tony Ferrino Phenomenon'' in 1997.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Eurovision Song Contest 1965 - Simone de Oliveira.jpg|[[Simone de Oliveira]] in Naples ({{Escyr|1965}})\nFile:JoseCidEurovision.jpg|[[Jos\u00e9 Cid]] in The Hague ({{Escyr|1980}})\nFile:Sofia Vit\u00f3ria - Portugal 2004.jpg|[[Sofia Vit\u00f3ria]] in Istanbul ({{Escyr|2004}})\nFile:ESC 2007 Portugal - Sabrina - Dan\u00e7a comigo.jpg|[[Sabrina (Portuguese artist)|Sabrina]] in Helsinki ({{Escyr|2007}})\nFile:V\u00e2nia Fernandes Final.jpg|[[V\u00e2nia Fernandes]] in Belgrade ({{Escyr|2008}})\nImage:Esc port.jpg|[[Flor-de-Lis]] in Moscow ({{Escyr|2009}})\nFile:Filipa Azevedo 01.JPG|[[Filipa Azevedo]] in Oslo ({{Escyr|2010}})\nFile:ESC2014 - Portugal 01.jpg|[[Suzy (singer)|Suzy]] in Copenhagen ({{Escyr|2014}})\nFile:20150520 ESC 2015 Leonor Andrade 3452.jpg|[[Leonor Andrade]] in Vienna ({{Escyr|2015}})\nImage:Salvador Sobral (Eurovision 2017).jpg|[[Salvador Sobral]] in Kyiv ({{Escyr|2017}})\nImage:Cl\u00e1udia Pascoal (Portugal 2018).jpg|[[Cl\u00e1udia Pascoal]] in Lisbon ({{Escyr|2018}})\nImage:ESC2019-Portugal.jpg|[[Conan Os\u00edris]] in Tel Aviv ({{Escyr|2019}})\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Portugal in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] &ndash; Junior version of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n*[[Portugal in the Eurovision Dance Contest]] &ndash; Dance version of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n*[[Portugal in the Eurovision Young Dancers]] &ndash; A competition organised by the EBU for younger dancers aged between 16 and 21.\n*[[Portugal in the Eurovision Young Musicians]] &ndash; A competition organised by the EBU for musicians aged 18 years and younger.\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Portugal in Eurovision}}\n{{Eurovision Song Contest}}\n\n[[Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest]]\n[[Category:Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox song contest country\n| Name = Portugal\n| Member station = [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]]\n| National selection event = \n{{Collapsible list\n | title = '''National final'''\n | '''[[Festival da Can\u00e7\u00e3o]]'''\n | 1964\u20131969\n | 1971\u20131999\n | 2001\n | 2003\u20132004\n | 2006\u20132012\n | 2014\u20132015\n | 2017\u20132020\n}}\n| ESC apps = 51 (42 finals)\n| ESC first = [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964]]\n| ESC last = \n| ESC best = 1st: [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017|2017]] \n| ESC worst = Last: [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018]]\n| Nul points = [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]]\n| Website = [http://media.rtp.pt/eurovisao/ RTP page]\n| EBU page = https://eurovision.tv/country/portugal\n| Current = 2020\n}}\n\n'''[[Portugal]]''' has participated in the '''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]''' 51 times since its debut at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964 contest]]. Since then it has missed five contests ({{escyr|1970}}, {{escyr|2000}}, {{escyr|2002}}, {{escyr|2013}} and {{escyr|2016}}). The contest is broadcast in Portugal by [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal]] (RTP). Portugal won the contest for the first time in {{escyr|2017}} and hosted the {{escyr|2018}} contest in [[Lisbon]].\n\nPortugal finished last on its debut in 1964 and again in {{escyr|1974}}, before achieving its best result of the 20th century in {{escyr|1996}}, with [[L\u00facia Moniz]] finishing sixth. The country then finished last for the third time in {{escyr|1997}}. Having not appeared in the final since {{escyr|2010}} and as holders of the record for most appearances in the contest without a win, Portugal won at the 49th attempt, when [[Salvador Sobral]] won the {{escyr|2017}} contest with the song \"[[Amar Pelos Dois]]\", Portugal's first top five result in the contest.  As hosts in 2018, the country finished last in the contest for the fourth time. In 2019, the country failed to qualify.\n\n==History==\nPortugal's debut entry was [[Ant\u00f3nio Calv\u00e1rio]] with \"[[Ora\u00e7\u00e3o]]\". It was not a successful debut for the country, with Calv\u00e1rio coming last in the contest. Since then, Portugal has come last on three further occasions, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]], when [[Paulo de Carvalho]] sang \"[[E depois do adeus]]\", in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]], when C\u00e9lia Lawson performed \"[[Antes do adeus]]\" and in {{escyr|2018}} as a host country. Despite its last-place finish in the contest, \"E depois do adeus\" gained notability for being used as the radio musical signal to begin the [[Carnation Revolution]] against the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, being played at 22:55 on the 24th of April, 1974.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYVONDlu-Zs The Eurovision song that made Portuguese history - second Semi-Final - Eurovision 2018, Official Youtube Eurovision Channel, 10.05.2018]</ref> Prior to their sixth-place finish for [[L\u00facia Moniz]], with the song \"[[O meu cora\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o tem cor]]\" in {{escyr|1996}}, Portugal's best result in the contest was two seventh-place finishes, for [[Carlos Mendes (singer)|Carlos Mendes]] in {{escyr|1972}} and [[Jos\u00e9 Cid]] in {{escyr|1980}}. Despite having some really weak results, the 90s were the most successful decade for the country, reaching the top 10 four times. Portugal had admission to take part in the 2000 and 2002 contest but refused. Its place was taken by Latvia both times, which ended up winning the contest in the latter year.\n\nSince semi-finals were introduced in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]], Portugal has failed to reach the final eight times, including from 2004 to 2007. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], [[V\u00e2nia Fernandes]] finished 13th with the song \"[[Senhora do mar (Negras \u00e1guas)|Senhora do Mar]],\" Portugal's best outcome since 1996. The country continued to be present in the final until 2010. In {{escyr|2017}}, Portugal reached the finals with [[Salvador Sobral]]'s entry, \"[[Amar pelos dois]]\", ending a 6-year non-appearance in the finals, as it did not participate in the contest in 2013 and 2016 and did not qualify for the finals in 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015, finally winning the contest for the first time ever, earning 758 points, setting the record for the highest number of points in the history of the [[Eurovision Song Contest|competition]], topping both the televoting and jury voting for the first time since {{Esccnty|Austria|y=2014}}'s \"[[Rise Like a Phoenix]]\" in {{Escyr|2014}}. It was the first winning song entirely performed in a country's native language since {{Esccnty|Serbia|y=2007}}'s \"[[Molitva]]\" in {{Escyr|2007}}. In {{escyr|2018}}, as a host country, Portugal came last for the fourth time in the contest, and for the first time in a non-joint last position. This was the third instance of a host country placing in the bottom 5 since {{escyr|2015}}.\n\n== Absences ==\nPortugal has been absent from five contests since their first participation. The country's first absence was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1970|1970]], where Portugal, along with four other countries, boycotted the contest due to the result of the previous year, when four countries were announced the winner.<ref name=\"Official History\">O'Connor, John Kennedy.

It is one of the longest-running Eurovision selection methods. Previously a number of regional juries selected the winner, however recently the winner has been selected through televoting. In 2009, 2010, 2017, 2018 and 2019 a 50-50 system between district juries and televote (like in the ESC) has been used.\n\nIn the years when Portugal does not participate in the contest, the Festival da Can\u00e7\u00e3o was not held, except in two occasions: in 1970, when Portugal boycotted the contest, and in 2000.\n\n== Contestants ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#87A96B|{{small|{{center|{{Abbr|W.|Withdrew}}}}}}\n|Withdrew/disqualified\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-bgcolor=\"#fe8080\"\n!{{Escyr|1964}}\n|[[Ant\u00f3nio Calv\u00e1rio]]\n|[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]\n|\"[[Ora\u00e7\u00e3o]]\"\n|align=center|13 \u25c1\n|align=center|0\n|rowspan=\"29\" colspan =\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1965}}\n|[[Simone de Oliveira]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Sol de inverno]]\"\n|align=center|13\n|align=center|1 \n|-\n!{{Escyr|1966}}\n|[[Madalena Igl\u00e9sias]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Ele e ela]]\"\n|align=center|13\n|align=center|6\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1967}}\n|[[Eduardo Nascimento]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[O vento mudou]]\"\n|align=center|12\n|align=center|3\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1968}}\n|[[Carlos Mendes (singer)|Carlos Mendes]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Ver\u00e3o]]\"\n|align=center|11\n|align=center|5\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1969}}\n|[[Simone de Oliveira]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Desfolhada portuguesa]]\"\n|align=center|15\n|align=center|4\n|-\n|{{N/A|{{Escyr|1970}}}}\n|colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|Did not participate}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1971}}\n|[[Tonicha]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Menina do alto da serra]]\"\n|align=center|9\n|align=center|83\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1972}}\n|[[Carlos Mendes (singer)|Carlos Mendes]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[A festa da vida]]\"\n|align=center|7\n|align=center|90\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1973}}\n|[[Fernando Tordo]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Tourada]]\"\n|align=center|10 \n|align=center|80\n|-bgcolor=\"#fe8080\" \n!{{Escyr|1974}}\n|[[Paulo de Carvalho]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[E depois do adeus]]\"\n|align=center|14 \u25c1\n|align=center|3\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1975}}\n|[[Duarte Mendes]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Madrugada (song)|Madrugada]]\"\n|align=center|16\n|align=center|16\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1976}}\n|[[Carlos do Carmo]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Uma flor de verde pinho]]\"\n|align=center|12\n|align=center|24\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1977}}\n|[[Os Amigos]]\n|Portuguese\n|\"[[Portugal no cora\u00e7\u00e3o]]\"\n|align=center|14\n|align=center|18{{Efn|During the voting sequence of the live show, several errors were made in the announcement of the scores, which were then adjusted after the broadcast.

The second volume had not been ready in time to be presented to Riddell. Burns wrote in 1794 to Robert Riddell's unmarried sister Eleanor, asking that she and her married sister Elizabeth would either return or destroy the manuscripts, saying that \"''I made a collection of all my trifles in verse which I had ever written. They are many of them local, some puerile and silly, and all of them unfit for the public eye. As I have some little fame at stake ... I am uneasy now for the fate of those manuscripts. ...

After Currie's death they passed into the possession of his son William Wallace Currie. In 1853 when William died his widow, without permission, offered them to a private gentlemen's club known as the [[Liverpool Athenaeum]]<ref name=\"Pd\"/> where they resided, forgotten in a box for circa twenty years, until in 1873 Mr. Henry A. Bright,<ref name=\"FGT\"/> uncovered them, wrote an account of them and put on display for 6 months.<ref name=\"JMT\"/> The club eventually decided to sell the manuscripts in what is likely to have been an illegal transaction,<ref name=\"Pd\"/> despite vociferous objections and the establishment of a 'Scots Committee' under the chairmanship of [[Lord Rosebery]] who intended to take action in the courts. The [[Liverpool Athenaeum]] added 'insult to injury' by revealing that they would use the proceeds of the sale to establish a 'Currie Memorial Fund'.<ref name=\"JMA\">{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=1992|title=Burns.

Burns started work on the first volume in May of that year. \n\nBurns wrote in the manuscript that \"''...If my Poems which I have transcribed into your book were equal to the grateful respect and high esteem I bear for the Gentleman to whom I present them, they would be the finest Poems in any language.''\"<ref name=\"JMK\"/>\n\nThe first volume contained several significant unpublished examples of Burns's work such as the \"''Lament for James, Earl of Glencairn''\"; \"''Epistle to John Goldie''\"; \"''Elegy on the Death of [[Sir James Hunter Blair, 1st Baronet|Sir James Hunter Blair]]''\"; \"''Tam o'Shanter''\" and \"''Holy Willie's Prayer''\".<ref name=\"Pd\"/>\n\nBurns also added the lines \"Let these be regarded as the genuine sentiments of a man who seldom flattered any, and never those he loved.\"<ref name=\"Pd\">{{Cite book|last=Purdie|first=David|year=2013|title=Maurice Lindsay's The Burns Encyclopaedia|publisher=Robert Hale|isbn=978-0-7090-9194-3|page=145}}</ref>\n\nThe pages have been numbered with the number placed in the centre of the top of the page and bracketed on the amanuenis's work and unbracketed on the top right or left of the page on those with Burns's writing, but not always on the fore-edge side.

I had meant that the book would have lain by me, in the fond hope that, some time or other, even after I was no more, my thoughts would fall into the hands of somebody capable of appreciating their value''.

[[Alexander Nasmyth]] was a landscape painter and was a reluctant portrait painter, however he met with Burns and they became friends, resulting in Nasmyth producing a portrait which he never fully completed due to his concern over spoiling what he had already achieved.

The second volume had not been ready in time to be presented to Riddell. Burns wrote in 1794 to Robert Riddell's unmarried sister Eleanor, asking that she and her married sister Elizabeth would either return or destroy the manuscripts, saying that \"''I made a collection of all my trifles in verse which I had ever written. They are many of them local, some puerile and silly, and all of them unfit for the public eye. As I have some little fame at stake ... I am uneasy now for the fate of those manuscripts. ...

After Currie's death they passed into the possession of his son William Wallace Currie. In 1853 when William died his widow, without permission, offered them to a private gentlemen's club known as the [[Liverpool Athenaeum]]<ref name=\"Pd\"/> where they resided, forgotten in a box for circa twenty years, until in 1873 Mr. Henry A. Bright,<ref name=\"FGT\"/> uncovered them, wrote an account of them and put on display for 6 months.<ref name=\"JMT\"/> The club eventually decided to sell the manuscripts in what is likely to have been an illegal transaction,<ref name=\"Pd\"/> despite vociferous objections and the establishment of a 'Scots Committee' under the chairmanship of [[Lord Rosebery]] who intended to take action in the courts. The [[Liverpool Athenaeum]] added 'insult to injury' by revealing that they would use the proceeds of the sale to establish a 'Currie Memorial Fund'.<ref name=\"JMA\">{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=1992|title=Burns.

Burns started work on the first volume in May of that year. \n\nBurns wrote in the manuscript that \"''...If my Poems which I have transcribed into your book were equal to the grateful respect and high esteem I bear for the Gentleman to whom I present them, they would be the finest Poems in any language.''\"<ref name=\"JMK\"/>\n\nThe first volume contained several significant unpublished examples of Burns's work such as the \"''Lament for James, Earl of Glencairn''\"; \"''Epistle to John Goldie''\"; \"''Elegy on the Death of [[Sir James Hunter Blair, 1st Baronet|Sir James Hunter Blair]]''\"; \"''Tam o'Shanter''\" and \"''Holy Willie's Prayer''\".<ref name=\"Pd\"/>\n\nBurns also added the lines \"Let these be regarded as the genuine sentiments of a man who seldom flattered any, and never those he loved.\"<ref name=\"Pd\">{{Cite book|last=Purdie|first=David|year=2013|title=Maurice Lindsay's The Burns Encyclopaedia|publisher=Robert Hale|isbn=978-0-7090-9194-3|page=145}}</ref>\n\nThe pages have been numbered with the number placed in the centre of the top of the page and bracketed on the amanuenis's work and unbracketed on the top right or left of the page on those with Burns's writing, but not always on the fore-edge side.

I had meant that the book would have lain by me, in the fond hope that, some time or other, even after I was no more, my thoughts would fall into the hands of somebody capable of appreciating their value''.

[[Alexander Nasmyth]] was a landscape painter and was a reluctant portrait painter, however he met with Burns and they became friends, resulting in Nasmyth producing a portrait which he never fully completed due to his concern over spoiling what he had already achieved. [[John Beugo]] the engraver arranged several sittings with Burns and produced a better likeness as confirmed by [[Gilbert Burns (farmer)|Gilbert Burns]].
