In this paper, Hill's first publication, he derived both the equilibrium form of the Langmuir equation, and also the exponential approach to equilibrium. The paper, written under the supervision of [[John Newport Langley]], is a landmark in the history of [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] theory, because the context for the derivation was the binding of nicotine and curare to the \"receptive substance\" at the [[neuromuscular junction]].\n\nHill made many exacting measurements of the heat released when skeletal muscles contract and relax. A key finding was that heat is produced during contraction, which requires investment of chemical energy, but not during relaxation, which is passive.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Bernard |title=Archibald Vivian Hill |journal=Bio.

After publication he learned that German physiologists had already reported on heat and muscle contraction and he went to Germany to learn more about their work. He continually improved his apparatus to make it more sensitive and to reduce the time lag between the heat released by the preparation and its recording by his [[thermocouple]]. \n \nHill is regarded, along with [[Hermann Helmholtz]], as one of the founders of biophysics.\n\nWhile a student he had enrolled in the Officers Training Course; he was a crack shot.

On site, Hill immediately proposed a simple two mirror method to determine airplane's heights. Transferred to Munitions, he realized that the mirrors could measure where smoke shells burst and if he fit this data with the [[ballistics|equations]] describing a shell's flight they could provide accurate range tables for anti-aircraft guns. To measure and compute he assembled a team of men too old for conscription, [[Ralph H. Fowler]] (a wounded officer), and lads too young for service including [[Douglas Hartree]] and [[Arthur Milne]]. Someone dubbed his motley group \"Hill's Brigands\", which they proudly adopted. Later in the war they also worked on locating enemy planes from their sound. He sped between their working sites on his beloved motorcycle. At the end of the war Major Hill issued certificates to more than one hundred Brigands. He was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]].\n\nHill returned briefly to Cambridge in 1919 before taking the chair in physiology at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in 1920 in succession to [[William Stirling (physiologist)|William Stirling]]. Using himself as the subject {{mdash}}he ran every morning from 7:15 to 10:30 {{mdash}} he showed that running a dash relies on energy stores which afterwards are replenished by [[Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption|increased oxygen consumption]]. Paralleling the work of German [[Otto Fritz Meyerhof]], Hill elucidated the processes whereby mechanical work is produced in muscles. The two shared the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for this work.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1922/hill-facts.html | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1922}}</ref> Hill introduced the concepts of [[VO2 max|maximal oxygen uptake]] and oxygen debt in 1922.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=Tudor|date=2008-02-15|title=History of developments in sport and exercise physiology: A.

In 1933, he became with [[Lord Beveridge]] and [[Lord Rutherford]] a founder member and vice-president of the [[Council for Assisting Refugee Academics|Academic Assistance Council]] (which in 1936 became the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning). By the start of the [[Second World War]], the organisation had saved 900 academics (18 of whom went on to win Nobel Prizes) from [[Nazi]] persecution. He prominently displayed in his laboratory a toy figure of Adolf Hitler with saluting arm upraised, which he explained was in gratitude for all the scientists Germany had expelled, some of whom were now working with him.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jean Medawar|author2=David Pyke|title=Hitler's gift: scientists who fled Nazi Germany |date=2001 |publisher=Piatkus |location=London |page=122}}</ref> Hill believed that \"Laughter is the best detergent for nonsense\".<ref>Van der Kloot 2014, p. 202.</ref>\n\nIn 1935 he served with [[Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett|Patrick Blackett]] and Sir [[Henry Tizard]] on the committee that gave birth to [[radar]]. He was also biological secretary of the Royal Society; [[William Henry Bragg]] was president. Both had been frustrated by the delay in putting scientists to work in the previous war. The Royal Society collated a list of scientists and Hill represented the Society at the Ministry of Labor. When the war came Hill led a campaign to liberate refugee scientists who had been interned. He served as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] from 1940 to 1945. In 1940 he was posted to the British Embassy in Washington to promote war research in the still neutral United States. He was authorized to swap secrets with the Americans, but this could not work: how do you place a value on another's secret? Hill saw the answer and persuaded the British to show the Americans everything they were working on (except for the atomic bomb). The mobilization of Allied scientist was one of the major successes in the war.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hastings |first1=Max |title=All Hell let loose: the World at War 1939-45 |date=2011 |publisher=Harper |location=London |page=81}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war he rebuilt his laboratory at University College and vigorously carried on research.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hill |first1=A.

Since then the house had been divided into flats and owned by [[Highgate School]], where Hill was a Governor from 1929\u20131960. It has now been sold, redeveloped and renamed as Hurstbourne. In Hill's time, according to his grandson [[Nicholas Humphrey]], regular guests at the house included 18 exiled Nobel laureates, his brother-in-law, the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], and friends [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. After-dinner conversations in the drawing room would inevitably involve passionate debates about science or politics. \u201cEvery Sunday we would have to attend a tea party at grandpa\u2019s house and apart from entertaining some extraordinary guests, he would devise some great games for us, such as frog racing in the garden or looking through the lens of a (dissected) sheep\u2019s eye.\u201d Sir [[Ralph Kohn]] [[Royal Society|FRS]] who proposed the Blue plaque, said: \u201cThe Nobel Prize winner A. V. Hill contributed vastly to our understanding of muscle physiology.  His work has resulted in wide-ranging application in sports medicine. As an outstanding Humanitarian and Parliamentarian, he was uncompromising in his condemnation of the Nazi regime for its persecution of scientists and others. A. V.

The paper, written under the supervision of [[John Newport Langley]], is a landmark in the history of [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] theory, because the context for the derivation was the binding of nicotine and curare to the \"receptive substance\" at the [[neuromuscular junction]].\n\nHill made many exacting measurements of the heat released when skeletal muscles contract and relax. A key finding was that heat is produced during contraction, which requires investment of chemical energy, but not during relaxation, which is passive.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Bernard |title=Archibald Vivian Hill |journal=Bio.

He continually improved his apparatus to make it more sensitive and to reduce the time lag between the heat released by the preparation and its recording by his [[thermocouple]]. \n \nHill is regarded, along with [[Hermann Helmholtz]], as one of the founders of biophysics.\n\nWhile a student he had enrolled in the Officers Training Course; he was a crack shot.

On site, Hill immediately proposed a simple two mirror method to determine airplane's heights. Transferred to Munitions, he realized that the mirrors could measure where smoke shells burst and if he fit this data with the [[ballistics|equations]] describing a shell's flight they could provide accurate range tables for anti-aircraft guns. To measure and compute he assembled a team of men too old for conscription, [[Ralph H. Fowler]] (a wounded officer), and lads too young for service including [[Douglas Hartree]] and [[Arthur Milne]]. Someone dubbed his motley group \"Hill's Brigands\", which they proudly adopted. Later in the war they also worked on locating enemy planes from their sound. He sped between their working sites on his beloved motorcycle. At the end of the war Major Hill issued certificates to more than one hundred Brigands. He was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]].\n\nHill returned briefly to Cambridge in 1919 before taking the chair in physiology at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in 1920 in succession to [[William Stirling (physiologist)|William Stirling]]. Using himself as the subject {{mdash}}he ran every morning from 7:15 to 10:30 {{mdash}} he showed that running a dash relies on energy stores which afterwards are replenished by [[Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption|increased oxygen consumption]]. Paralleling the work of German [[Otto Fritz Meyerhof]], Hill elucidated the processes whereby mechanical work is produced in muscles.

By the start of the [[Second World War]], the organisation had saved 900 academics (18 of whom went on to win Nobel Prizes) from [[Nazi]] persecution.

He was also biological secretary of the Royal Society; [[William Henry Bragg]] was president. Both had been frustrated by the delay in putting scientists to work in the previous war. The Royal Society collated a list of scientists and Hill represented the Society at the Ministry of Labor. When the war came Hill led a campaign to liberate refugee scientists who had been interned. He served as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] from 1940 to 1945. In 1940 he was posted to the British Embassy in Washington to promote war research in the still neutral United States. He was authorized to swap secrets with the Americans, but this could not work: how do you place a value on another's secret? Hill saw the answer and persuaded the British to show the Americans everything they were working on (except for the atomic bomb). The mobilization of Allied scientist was one of the major successes in the war.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hastings |first1=Max |title=All Hell let loose: the World at War 1939-45 |date=2011 |publisher=Harper |location=London |page=81}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war he rebuilt his laboratory at University College and vigorously carried on research.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hill |first1=A.

Since then the house had been divided into flats and owned by [[Highgate School]], where Hill was a Governor from 1929-1960. It has now been sold, redeveloped and renamed as Hurstbourne. In Hill's time, according to his grandson [[Nicholas Humphrey]], regular guests at the house included 18 exiled Nobel laureates, his brother-in-law, the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], and friends [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. After-dinner conversations in the drawing room would inevitably involve passionate debates about science or politics. \u201cEvery Sunday we would have to attend a tea party at grandpa\u2019s house and apart from entertaining some extraordinary guests, he would devise some great games for us, such as frog racing in the garden or looking through the lens of a (dissected) sheep\u2019s eye.\u201d Sir [[Ralph Kohn]] [[Royal Society|FRS]] who proposed the Blue plaque, said: \u201cThe Nobel Prize winner A.

He was one of the leading figures of the [[Shop Stewards' Movement]] in wartime [[Glasgow]] (the '[[Red Clydeside]]' period) and a founding member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].  He served two terms in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as the last Communist Member of Parliament (MP).\n\n== Early career ==\nGallacher was born in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], Scotland on 25 December 1881, the son of an Irish father and a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] mother. His father died when he was seven years old, and one of his earliest ambitions was to earn enough money so that his mother would no longer have to work as a washerwoman.  With his sisters, he finally achieved this goal at the age of nineteen, but his mother died shortly afterwards at the age of 54.<ref>'''Gallacher, William''' (1978) [1936]. pp. 1\u20134.</ref>\n\nHe began working at ten years old, and left school aged twelve. After a spell as a delivery boy for a [[greengrocer|grocer]] \u2013 where he had his first dispute with an employer \u2013 he found work in a sanitary engineering workshop.  He later had a spell as a steward on some transatlantic crossings, before beginning work at Albion Motor Works, [[Glasgow]], in 1912. After spending 1913 in the United States visiting his sisters in Chicago, he erected scaffolding in [[Belfast]].  Returning to Glasgow, he again found work at Albion Motor Works in 1914, just before the First World War broke out.<ref>'''Gallacher, William''' (1978) [1936]. pp. 7\u201317.</ref>\n\nThe \"weakness for alcohol\" shown by his father and elder brother, and the suffering this caused his mother, led him to become involved with the [[Temperance movement]] in his mid-adolescence. However, on discovering that colleagues had canvassed support for a director of a [[Gothenburg Public House System#In Scotland|Trust Public House]] in the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 General Election]], Gallacher ended his association with the organised Temperance movement.  He remained a lifelong teetotaller.<ref>'''Gallacher, William''' (1978) [1936]. pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\nA subsequent period as a member of the [[Independent Labour Party]] ended quickly and he joined the [[Social Democratic Federation]], which brought him into contact with [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John MacLean]]. In common with many socialists in mid-west [[Scotland]], Gallacher was greatly influenced by MacLean, though they were later to have an acrimonious falling out.  The [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] branch of the SDF introduced him to [[John Ross Campbell]], who would also become a prominent British Communist and the editor of the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Daily Worker]]'' from 1949\u20131959.<ref>'''Gallacher, William''' (1978) [1936]. pp. 15\u201316.</ref>\n\n== Wartime activities ==\nGallacher was opposed to British involvement in [[World War I]].<ref>'''Gallacher, William''' (1978) [1936]. pp. 28\u201329.</ref> He was Chairman of the [[Clyde Workers' Committee]], an organisation that was formed to organise Clydeside workers and, in particular, to campaign against the [[Munitions of War Act 1915]], which forbade engineers to leave the works in which they were employed.  [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Arthur Henderson]] met Gallacher and the Clyde Workers' Committee in Glasgow, but they were unwilling to back down on the issue. In 1916 the Clyde Workers' Committee journal, ''The Worker'', was prosecuted under the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914|Defence of the Realm Act]] for an article criticising the war. Gallacher and the editor [[John Muir (socialist)|John Muir]] were both found guilty and sent to prison, Gallacher for six months and Muir for one year.\n\n== Gallacher and the 40 Hours Movement ==\nAfter the war Gallacher was involved in the struggle for improving workers' conditions.  It was widely expected that the end of the war would be followed by widespread unemployment due to the re-entry of large numbers of demobilised soldiers and seamen into the workforce. Glasgow was expected to be particularly badly affected because a large proportion of its workforce was employed in war-related areas such as munitions and shipbuilding, which would suddenly contract with the end of the war. Gallacher and the Clyde Workers' Committee proposed a campaign to limit working-hours to thirty hours per week, which was altered to forty hours per week after the [[Glasgow Trades Council]] became involved.  In January 1919, the CWC and Trades Council launched a mass strike in support of the demand for a 40-hour working week.\n\nDuring the course of the agitation, the police broke up the mass rally of striking workers at [[George Square]], Glasgow on 31 January 1919. The [[Coalition]] government greatly overreacted to the strike, thinking that a [[Bolshevik]] insurrection was about to begin on Clydeside, and sent [[British Army]] troops and tanks onto the streets of Glasgow to control the situation. Whilst revolution was the furthest thing from the minds of the trade union leaders of the day, Gallacher later claimed that they should have marched to the barracks in the [[Maryhill]] district of the city and encouraged the Scottish troops there to leave them and join the workers against the government. The union leaders of the strike were arrested and charged with \"instigating and inciting large crowds of persons to form part of a riotous mob\". Gallacher was sent back to jail, being sentenced to five months.\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1920, Gallacher became a leading figure of the [[Communist Labour Party (UK)|Communist Labour Party]].  He led the grouping into the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) and stood for election  to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] at [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee]] (both in 1922 and 1923), [[West Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|West Fife]] (1929 and 1931) and [[Shipley (UK Parliament constituency)|Shipley]] (1930). He was eventually elected to represent the West Fife constituency at the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]].\n\nIn 1925, Gallacher was one of twelve members of the Communist Party convicted at the [[Old Bailey]] under the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797, and one of the five defendants sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. In 1936, Gallacher supported the views of members of the [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] such as [[Stafford Cripps]] and [[Aneurin Bevan]] who were arguing in favour of giving military assistance to the [[Spanish Popular Front]] government fighting against [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] Nationalist forces in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nGallacher lost his West Fife seat to the Labour Party at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 General Election]], coming third behind the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberal]] candidate. He remained politically active serving as President of the CPGB from 1956 to 1963.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rGxAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kaMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4526%2C2441647 |title=Gallagher Retires as Leader of the Communist Party |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=16 April 1963 |page=7 |accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref> In an article published in the party's ''Labour Monthly'' in April 1953 he appraised the career of [[Joseph Stalin]]; the Soviet leader had died the previous month, concluding with the assertion that \"his life ended with his work completed, for the Party and the Soviet people still under his wise guidance will go forward, resolute as he was resolute\u2014to the new truly free society of Marx and Engels, of Lenin and of Stalin\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Gallacher|first=William|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/gallacher/1953/04/stalin.htm|title=Tribute to Stalin|work=Labour Monthly|volume=XXXV|issue=4|date=April 1953|accessdate=18 November 2017|via=Marxists.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823010702/https://www.marxists.org/archive/gallacher/1953/04/stalin.htm|archive-date=23 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGallacher was the author of several books, including ''The Case for Communism'' (1949), his autobiography, ''The Chosen Few'' (1940), and ''The Tyrant's Might is Passing'' (1954).

[[David Lloyd George]] and [[Arthur Henderson]] met Gallacher and the Clyde Workers' Committee in Glasgow, but they were unwilling to back down on the issue. In 1916 the Clyde Workers' Committee journal, ''The Worker'', was prosecuted under the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914|Defence of the Realm Act]] for an article criticising the war. Gallacher and the editor [[John Muir (socialist)|John Muir]] were both found guilty and sent to prison, Gallacher for six months and Muir for one year.\n\n== Gallacher and the 40 Hours Movement ==\nAfter the war Gallacher was involved in the struggle for improving workers' conditions.  It was widely expected that the end of the war would be followed by widespread unemployment due to the re-entry of large numbers of demobilised soldiers and seamen into the workforce. Glasgow was expected to be particularly badly affected because a large proportion of its workforce was employed in war-related areas such as munitions and shipbuilding, which would suddenly contract with the end of the war. Gallacher and the Clyde Workers' Committee proposed a campaign to limit working-hours to thirty hours per week, which was altered to forty hours per week after the [[Glasgow Trades Council]] became involved.  In January 1919, the CWC and Trades Council launched a mass strike in support of the demand for a 40-hour working week.\n\nDuring the course of the agitation, the police broke up the mass rally of striking workers at [[George Square]], Glasgow on 31 January 1919. The [[Coalition]] government greatly overreacted to the strike, thinking that a [[Bolshevik]] insurrection was about to begin on Clydeside, and sent [[British Army]] troops and tanks onto the streets of Glasgow to control the situation. Whilst revolution was the furthest thing from the minds of the trade union leaders of the day, Gallacher later claimed that they should have marched to the barracks in the [[Maryhill]] district of the city and encouraged the Scottish troops there to leave them and join the workers against the government. The union leaders of the strike were arrested and charged with \"instigating and inciting large crowds of persons to form part of a riotous mob\". Gallacher was sent back to jail, being sentenced to five months.\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1920, Gallacher became a leading figure of the [[Communist Labour Party (UK)|Communist Labour Party]].  He led the grouping into the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) and stood for election  to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] at [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee]] (both in 1922 and 1923), [[West Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|West Fife]] (1929 and 1931) and [[Shipley (UK Parliament constituency)|Shipley]] (1930). He was eventually elected to represent the West Fife constituency at the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]].\n\nIn 1925, Gallacher was one of twelve members of the Communist Party convicted at the [[Old Bailey]] under the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797, and one of the five defendants sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. In 1936, Gallacher supported the views of members of the [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] such as [[Stafford Cripps]] and [[Aneurin Bevan]] who were arguing in favour of giving military assistance to the [[Spanish Popular Front]] government fighting against [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] Nationalist forces in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nGallacher lost his West Fife seat to the Labour Party at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 General Election]], coming third behind the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberal]] candidate. He remained politically active serving as President of the CPGB from 1956 to 1963.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rGxAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kaMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4526%2C2441647 |title=Gallagher Retires as Leader of the Communist Party |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=16 April 1963 |page=7 |accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref> In an article published in the party's ''Labour Monthly'' in April 1953 he appraised the career of [[Joseph Stalin]]; the Soviet leader had died the previous month, concluding with the assertion that \"his life ended with his work completed, for the Party and the Soviet people still under his wise guidance will go forward, resolute as he was resolute\u2014to the new truly free society of Marx and Engels, of Lenin and of Stalin\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Gallacher|first=William|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/gallacher/1953/04/stalin.htm|title=Tribute to Stalin|work=Labour Monthly|volume=XXXV|issue=4|date=April 1953|accessdate=18 November 2017|via=Marxists.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823010702/https://www.marxists.org/archive/gallacher/1953/04/stalin.htm|archive-date=23 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGallacher was the author of several books, including ''The Case for Communism'' (1949), his autobiography, ''The Chosen Few'' (1940), and ''The Tyrant's Might is Passing'' (1954).

He was [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Sunderland (UK Parliament constituency)|Sunderland]] from 1935\u20131945. From 1938-1940 he was a junior [[Lord of the Treasury]].<ref>{{cite web|title=thePeerage.com|url=http://thepeerage.com/p41556.htm#i415559}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nFurness was born the second son of [[Sir Stephen Furness, 1st Baronet|Sir Stephen Wilson Furness]], who was Liberal MP for The Hartlepools. He was younger brother of [[Sir Christopher Furness, 2nd Baronet]]. He was educated at [[Charterhouse School]] and [[Oriel College, Oxford]].<ref>\u2018FURNESS, Stephen Noel\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U154660, accessed 29 April 2016]</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nFurness was Called to Bar by [[Middle Temple]] in 1927.<ref>\u2018FURNESS, Stephen Noel\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U154660, accessed 29 April 2016]</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nFurness was Liberal candidate for [[The Hartlepools (UK Parliament constituency)|The Hartlepools]] division of [[Durham, England|Durham]] at the 1929 General Election. His father had represented this constituency for the Liberals from 1910\u201314. The Liberals had lost the seat to the Unionists at the previous election in 1924 by about 3,000 votes. A UK-wide Liberal revival in 1929 helped Furness, but not enough for him to re-take the seat, falling just 138 votes short. He was re-selected by the local Liberal Association to contest the following general election.\n\nIn 1931, following the economic crisis, a National Government was formed that included both Liberals and Conservatives. A snap election was called and Liberals were encouraged not to oppose sitting Conservative MPs. Furness thus withdrew as Liberal candidate on 14 October, just 13 days before polling day.<ref>Hartlepool Northern Daily Mail 14 Oct 1931</ref> Four years later, his personal sacrifice for the National Government was rewarded when he was chosen as a Liberal National candidate for the dual member seat of Sunderland. The Conservatives won both seats in 1931 when there were no Liberals standing. In 1935 one of those MPs retired and Furness was chosen to run in harness with the other Conservative. With no opposition Liberal candidates standing, he was easily elected, topping the poll.\n\nIn parliament he was [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Sir John Simon]], the Liberal National Leader, from 1936\u201337. He was an Assistant Government Whip from 1937\u201338 and a [[Junior Lord of the Treasury]] from 1938\u201340.<ref>\u2018FURNESS, Stephen Noel\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U154660, accessed 29 April 2016]</ref> When the National Government of [[Neville Chamberlain]] fell in 1940 and [[Winston Churchill]] formed his Coalition Government, Furness went to the back benches.

He was younger brother of [[Sir Christopher Furness, 2nd Baronet]]. He was educated at [[Charterhouse School]] and [[Oriel College, Oxford]].<ref>\u2018FURNESS, Stephen Noel\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U154660, accessed 29 April 2016]</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nFurness was Called to Bar by [[Middle Temple]] in 1927.<ref>\u2018FURNESS, Stephen Noel\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U154660, accessed 29 April 2016]</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nFurness was Liberal candidate for [[The Hartlepools (UK Parliament constituency)|The Hartlepools]] division of [[Durham, England|Durham]] at the 1929 General Election. His father had represented this constituency for the Liberals from 1910-14. The Liberals had lost the seat to the Unionists at the previous election in 1924 by about 3,000 votes. A UK-wide Liberal revival in 1929 helped Furness, but not enough for him to re-take the seat, falling just 138 votes short. He was re-selected by the local Liberal Association to contest the following general election.\n\nIn 1931, following the economic crisis, a National Government was formed that included both Liberals and Conservatives. A snap election was called and Liberals were encouraged not to oppose sitting Conservative MPs. Furness thus withdrew as Liberal candidate on 14 October, just 13 days before polling day.<ref>Hartlepool Northern Daily Mail 14 Oct 1931</ref> Four years later, his personal sacrifice for the National Government was rewarded when he was chosen as a Liberal National candidate for the dual member seat of Sunderland. The Conservatives won both seats in 1931 when there were no Liberals standing. In 1935 one of those MPs retired and Furness was chosen to run in harness with the other Conservative. With no opposition Liberal candidates standing, he was easily elected, topping the poll.\n\nIn parliament he was [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Sir John Simon]], the Liberal National Leader, from 1936\u201337. He was an Assistant Government Whip from 1937\u201338 and a [[Junior Lord of the Treasury]] from 1938\u201340.<ref>\u2018FURNESS, Stephen Noel\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U154660, accessed 29 April 2016]</ref> When the National Government of [[Neville Chamberlain]] fell in 1940 and [[Winston Churchill]] formed his Coalition Government, Furness went to the back benches. At the end of the war, he ran for re-election, again as a Liberal National in harness with a Conservative. However, this time he was defeated as the country turned to the Labour Party.
