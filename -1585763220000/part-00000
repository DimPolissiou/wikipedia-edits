It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 20, 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received critical acclaim, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design and combat mechanics.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nIn a demo build unveiled to the public in January 2020, further new mechanics were also revealed, including high-difficulty Slayer Challenges, additional upgrade resources including Sentinel Crystals, and the ability to take control of some enemy units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://happymag.tv/watch-15-minutes-of-new-doom-eternal-gameplay/|title=Watch 15 minutes of new 'DOOM Eternal' gameplay|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nCreative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]]. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=2019-10-08|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors. Players can also unlock a bonus weapon, the Unmaykr, after clearing six challenging Slayer Gates. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternals-hub-area-the-fortress-of-doom-has-up/1100-6472907/|title=Doom Eternal's Hub Area: The Fortress Of Doom Has Upgrades, Easter Eggs, And More|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nTwo years after the events of 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', Earth has been overrun by demonic forces, wiping out 60% of the planet's population, under the now-corrupted Union Aerospace Corporation. What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement initially formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a new arsenal of weapons and a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to [[New York City]] and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to Hell  to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge; the Slayer retrieves his Super Shotgun and defeats the Priest's Doom Hunter guardians before killing him.\n\nIn response to Deag Ranak\u2019s death, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a secure location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. After destroying the nest, Vega suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to a compound where he retrieves Hayden\u2019s robot chassis as well as the Crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden\u2019s mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars\u2019s core, the Slayer travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars and makes his way to Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, the Slayer's past is revealed. The Slayer, who is identified by the name \"[[Doomguy]]\", is revealed to be from Earth. He was found on Sentinel Prime badly wounded, and ranting about his desire to kill the demons who were then unknown to the Sentinels and the Khan Maykr. The Priests had Doomguy tested in a gladiatorial arena where he bested his opponents and thereafter was inducted into the Sentinel military. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena. Despite knowing it is against Sentinel law, Slayer kills Deag Grav after defeating his guardian, the Gladiator and returns to the fortress.\n\nDespite stopping the demons' invasion of Earth, the Slayer's fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr, who resolves to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind. However, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. More of the Slayer's past is revealed. During Hell's invasion of the Sentinels' world a rogue [[Seraph|servant]] to the Khan Maykr imbued Doomguy with superior abilities, transforming him into the Slayer. It is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, Urdak, to survive.\n\nWith the Icon of Sin on Urdak, Hayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Maykr\u2019s dimension. He then finds the Khan Maykr and stops the ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon\u2019s heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and manages to teleport to Earth. The Icon\u2019s awakening also breaks the alliance between the Maykrs and Demons, who proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer over his actions, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer manages to kill the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin. After an intense battle, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell\u2019s invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.

It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 20, 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received critical acclaim, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design and combat mechanics.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nIn a demo build unveiled to the public in January 2020, further new mechanics were also revealed, including high-difficulty Slayer Challenges, additional upgrade resources including Sentinel Crystals, and the ability to take control of some enemy units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://happymag.tv/watch-15-minutes-of-new-doom-eternal-gameplay/|title=Watch 15 minutes of new 'DOOM Eternal' gameplay|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nCreative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]]. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=2019-10-08|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors. Players can also unlock a bonus weapon, the Unmaykr, after clearing six challenging Slayer Gates. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternals-hub-area-the-fortress-of-doom-has-up/1100-6472907/|title=Doom Eternal's Hub Area: The Fortress Of Doom Has Upgrades, Easter Eggs, And More|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nTwo years after the events of 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', Earth has been overrun by demonic forces, wiping out 60% of the planet's population, under the now-corrupted Union Aerospace Corporation. What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement initially formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a new arsenal of weapons and a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to [[New York City]] and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to Hell  to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge; the Slayer retrieves his Super Shotgun and defeats the Priest's Doom Hunter guardians before killing him.\n\nIn response to Deag Ranak\u2019s death, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a secure location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. After destroying the nest, Vega suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to a compound where he retrieves Hayden\u2019s robot chassis as well as the Crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden\u2019s mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars\u2019s core, the Slayer travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars and makes his way to Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, the Slayer's past is revealed. The Slayer, who is identified by the name \"[[Doomguy]]\", is revealed to be from Earth. He was found on Sentinel Prime badly wounded, and ranting about his desire to kill the demons who were then unknown to the Sentinels and the Khan Maykr. The Priests had Doomguy tested in a gladiatorial arena where he bested his opponents and thereafter was inducted into the Sentinel military. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena. Despite knowing it is against Sentinel law, Slayer kills Deag Grav after defeating his guardian, the Gladiator and returns to the fortress.\n\nDespite stopping the demons' invasion of Earth, the Slayer's fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr, who resolves to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind. However, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. More of the Slayer's past is revealed. During Hell's invasion of the Sentinels' world a rogue [[Seraph|servant]] to the Khan Maykr imbued Doomguy with superior abilities, transforming him into the Slayer. It is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, Urdak, to survive.\n\nWith the Icon of Sin on Urdak, Hayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Maykr\u2019s dimension. He then finds the Khan Maykr and stops the ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon\u2019s heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and manages to teleport to Earth. The Icon\u2019s awakening also breaks the alliance between the Maykrs and Demons, who proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer over his actions, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer manages to kill the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin. After an intense battle, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell\u2019s invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.

The character arrived in ''Coronation Street'' to help her sister [[Maggie Cooke]] ([[Irene Sutcliffe]]) run the corner shop, and since then had a number of storylines which saw her become twice widowed, and mother to an illegitimate son.\n\nFor most of her tenure in the show, Betty worked as a barmaid in the soap's [[Rovers Return Inn]], where she created a signature dish, known as Betty's [[Lancashire hotpot|hotpot]].\n\nDriver died in October 2011, and Betty was subsequently written out, with the character dying off-screen from an illness in April 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/275055-coronation-street-producer-vows-to-give-betty-magnificent-send-off/|title=Coronation Street producer vows to give Betty magnificent send-off|date=17 October 2011|publisher=[[STV (TV channel)|STV]]|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Creation==\nBetty Driver, who had been performing since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in [[Cheshire]] and [[Derbyshire]].<ref name=\"journey\">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/218/218844_bettys_journey_from_hotchpotch_to_hotpot.html|title=Betty's journey from hotch-potch to hotpot|date=25 July 2006|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Natalie|last=Anglesey|accessdate=2008-11-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130114072307/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/218/218844_bettys_journey_from_hotchpotch_to_hotpot.html|archivedate=14 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, producer of ''Coronation Street'', [[H.

Ted left her to return to his family and Gordon was adopted by Betty's sister [[Maggie Cooke|Maggie]] ([[Irene Sutcliffe]]) and her husband [[List of past Coronation Street characters (1960-1969)#Les Clegg|Les Clegg]] ([[John Sharp (actor)|John Sharp]]). Betty celebrated the end of the war with her sweetheart [[Billy Williams (Coronation Street)|Billy Williams]] ([[Frank Mills (British actor)|Frank Mills]]), to whom she had lost her virginity. The two lost touch, and in 1949, Betty married policeman [[Cyril Turpin]] ([[William Moore (actor)|William Moore]]).<ref name=\"Little\">{{cite book |title=The Women of Coronation Street |last=Little |first=Daran |authorlink=Daran Little |date=9 October 1998 |publisher= [[Boxtree]]|isbn=978-0-7522-2443-5 |pages= 98\u20139}}</ref>\n\n===Storylines===\nBetty and her husband Cyril move to ''Coronation Street'' in June 1969, helping her sister Maggie to run the local corner shop following the breakup of Maggie's marriage to Les Clegg. Maggie, however, resents Betty's interference and persuades landlord [[Jack Walker (Coronation Street)|Jack Walker]] ([[Arthur Leslie]]) to give Betty a job as a barmaid at [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]] [[public house]]. Betty clashes with the landlady [[Annie Walker (Coronation Street)|Annie Walker]] ([[Doris Speed]]), who fears that Jack may find her attractive, and fires Betty as a result. Betty takes a job in a rival pub, and returns only when Annie apologises. Betty becomes close friends with fellow barmaid [[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]), who on occasion lodges with her, uses Betty as a chaperone on dates, and frequently seeks her advice in running her life.\n\nCyril's employment as a policeman causes Betty problems when Keith Lucas (David Webb), a man he has previously arrested, begins stalking her. She initially refrains from telling Cyril, fearing that he will get into trouble. When Cyril finds out, he attacks Lucas with a piece of lead piping and has to leave the police force.

This leads to a reunion with Ted, the man who fathered Gordon, though he is unaware of his son's existence. Ted visits Betty in hospital after reading about her mugging in a newspaper. Betty agonises over whether to tell Ted about Gordon, but decides against it, preferring not to stir up the past.\n\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of [[VE Day]] in 1995, Betty is reunited with her wartime sweetheart Billy. The two marry several months later, and Gordon gives his mother away. They live happily together until Billy also dies of a heart attack in 1997. Betty becomes famous in [[Weatherfield]] for her hotpots, which come under scrutiny in the early 1990s when it is believed that they are contaminated. She is cleared of all wrongdoing when it is discovered that beer, not food, is responsible for a spate of stomach upsets. Betty acts as lady mayoress alongside mayor [[Alf Roberts]] ([[Bryan Mosley]]) when his wife [[Audrey Roberts|Audrey]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) has no interest in fulfilling her civic duties. This includes accompanying him to receive his OBE from the Queen, much to Audrey's chagrin.\n{{Rquote|right|\"The Street's residents are her family and she doesn't want to be far from them.

Later, Enid becomes sick after Steve serves her a 3-month old hotpot. Betty and Steve are left terrified when they realise that the hotpot could kill Enid, but she later recovers. During the tram crash of December 2010, Betty comforts [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]) after her husband [[Ashley Peacock|Ashley]] ([[Steven Arnold]]) is tragically crushed to death by the rubble.\n\nBetty is last seen in May 2011, trying in vain to stop [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) and [[Kylie Platt]] ([[Paula Lane]]) from coming behind the bar to speak with [[Becky McDonald]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]). Although Betty is mentioned and referred to by various characters, her subsequent absence was not explained until February 2012, when Audrey asks [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) how Betty is, to which Stella replies that Betty is \"still a bit under the weather\".\n\nOn 16 April 2012, Emily and [[Rita Sullivan]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) arrange to visit a convalescing Betty and go to meet Gordon, who has agreed to drive them there. However, when Gordon does arrive, he brings with him the unexpected news that Betty has died peacefully in her sleep the night before. The residents of the street all gather in The Rovers Return and hold an impromptu memorial for Betty, with all of her old friends reminiscing about her. Gordon, with some persuasion from Emily, decides to have his mother buried in Weatherfield after initially contemplating London. It is later revealed that Annie left The Rovers Return to Betty in her will; however, Betty never acted on this. Gordon assures Stella that he is not interested in the pub and it will remain in her possession. Despite being one of the street's longest serving characters, Betty's funeral was held off-screen. After the wake and lock-up, Stella hangs a photo of Betty on the wall over The Rovers Return, for all to see and remember her. This photo was destroyed during a fire at The Rovers Return in March 2013 started by [[Karl Munro]] ([[John Michie]]) but, following the refurbishment, Rita managed to obtain an identical copy which remains hanging on the wall in the same place.\n\n===Personality===\nIn his 1998 book ''The Women of Coronation Street'', [[Daran Little]] describes Betty as an archetypal mother figure. He compares her to one of ''Coronation Street''{{'}}s original characters [[Minnie Caldwell]] ([[Margot Bryant]]), as she is \"warm and comforting [...] loves cats and has had her share of lodgers\"; however, Little notes that \"while Minnie wandered through life in a haze, Betty is sharp-witted, blessed with insight and wisdom\". Discussing her evolving characterisation, Little writes: \"She hasn't always been the incarnation of lovable joviality: when she arrived in the Street in 1969, she was loud, brash and a vicious-tongued gossip.\"<ref name=\"Little\"/>\n\nBetty's two passions in life are [[darts]] and food. Playing darts brings out her competitive side, and she enjoys beating her male customers. Cyril frequently protests when Betty attempts to diet, as he prefers her \"homely and comfortable\" figure. Ultimately, Betty stops trying to lose weight, stating: \"I had to {{sic|?|chose|reason=\"to choose\" is correct}} between losing a few pounds or losing my marital partner. If my Cyril had wanted to marry a skinny rabbit he'd have married one.\"<ref name=\"Little\"/> Betty breaks down when Cyril dies from a heart attack, with Little noting that: \"Cyril had been the stabilizing force in Betty's life, and without him she relied heavily on her job and friends at the Rovers \u2013 she couldn't face life alone at home\".<ref name=\"Little\"/> Little has observed that Betty \"has a finely tuned sense of right and wrong and has never been afraid to stand up for her beliefs\", citing Betty's shock at being mugged in 1982, and calling the [[NSPCC]] to report a female neighbour whose children were left outside until nightfall while their mother entertained her boyfriend.<ref name=\"Little\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Driver discussed her character, saying, \"''Coronation Street'' characters tend to fit into one of two camps. Those who have drama after drama and those who muddle through life, often in the background, as sturdy and dependable as the famous cobbles. Betty falls into the latter group.

During the tram crash of December 2010, Betty comforts [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]) after her husband [[Ashley Peacock|Ashley]] ([[Steven Arnold]]) is tragically crushed to death by the rubble.\n\nBetty is last seen in May 2011, trying in vain to stop [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) and [[Kylie Platt]] ([[Paula Lane]]) from coming behind the bar to speak with [[Becky McDonald]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]). Although Betty is mentioned and referred to by various characters, her subsequent absence was not explained until February 2012, when Audrey asks [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) how Betty is, to which Stella replies that Betty is \"still a bit under the weather\".\n\nOn 16 April 2012, Emily and [[Rita Sullivan]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) arrange to visit a convalescing Betty and go to meet Gordon, who has agreed to drive them there. However, when Gordon does arrive, he brings with him the unexpected news that Betty has died peacefully in her sleep the night before. The residents of the street all gather in The Rovers Return and hold an impromptu memorial for Betty, with all of her old friends reminiscing about her. Gordon, with some persuasion from Emily, decides to have his mother buried in Weatherfield after initially contemplating London. It is later revealed that Annie left The Rovers Return to Betty in her will; however, Betty never acted on this. Gordon assures Stella that he is not interested in the pub and it will remain in her possession. Despite being one of the street's longest serving characters, Betty's funeral was held off-screen. After the wake and lock-up, Stella hangs a photo of Betty on the wall over The Rovers Return, for all to see and remember her. This photo was destroyed during a fire at The Rovers Return in March 2013 started by [[Karl Munro]] ([[John Michie]]) but, following the refurbishment, Rita managed to obtain an identical copy which remains hanging on the wall in the same place.\n\n===Personality===\nIn his 1998 book ''The Women of Coronation Street'', [[Daran Little]] describes Betty as an archetypal mother figure. He compares her to one of ''Coronation Street''{{'}}s original characters [[Minnie Caldwell]] ([[Margot Bryant]]), as she is \"warm and comforting [...] loves cats and has had her share of lodgers\"; however, Little notes that \"while Minnie wandered through life in a haze, Betty is sharp-witted, blessed with insight and wisdom\". Discussing her evolving characterisation, Little writes: \"She hasn't always been the incarnation of lovable joviality: when she arrived in the Street in 1969, she was loud, brash and a vicious-tongued gossip.\"<ref name=\"Little\"/>\n\nBetty's two passions in life are [[darts]] and food. Playing darts brings out her competitive side, and she enjoys beating her male customers. Cyril frequently protests when Betty attempts to diet, as he prefers her \"homely and comfortable\" figure. Ultimately, Betty stops trying to lose weight, stating: \"I had to {{sic|?|chose|reason=\"to choose\" is correct}} between losing a few pounds or losing my marital partner. If my Cyril had wanted to marry a skinny rabbit he'd have married one.\"<ref name=\"Little\"/> Betty breaks down when Cyril dies from a heart attack, with Little noting that: \"Cyril had been the stabilizing force in Betty's life, and without him she relied heavily on her job and friends at the Rovers \u2013 she couldn't face life alone at home\".<ref name=\"Little\"/> Little has observed that Betty \"has a finely tuned sense of right and wrong and has never been afraid to stand up for her beliefs\", citing Betty's shock at being mugged in 1982, and calling the [[NSPCC]] to report a female neighbour whose children were left outside until nightfall while their mother entertained her boyfriend.<ref name=\"Little\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Driver discussed her character, saying, \"''Coronation Street'' characters tend to fit into one of two camps. Those who have drama after drama and those who muddle through life, often in the background, as sturdy and dependable as the famous cobbles. Betty falls into the latter group. There have been moments of drama, intrigue and even romance \u2013 but it has been her presence behind the bar, cutting up pieces of lamb and chunks of potato, that has endeared her to the viewers.\"<ref name=\"Procter\"/> When asked about Betty's \"sharp tongue\", Driver suggested, \"Not really sharp. [Betty's] just straightforward. [She's] not nasty to anybody but [she doesn't] suffer fools gladly.\"<ref name=\"Procter\"/>\n\n===Barmaid of The Rovers Return===\nBetty was the longest-serving barmaid of the soap's public house, [[The Rovers Return]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/galleries/Picturespecials/Roversbarmaids/default.html?ModuleId=146628&ImageIndex=6&XPos=0&YPos=344&ThumbScrollPos=48|title=Coronation Street: Rovers barmaids|work=ITV|accessdate=2009-05-07}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> She first served behind the bar in 1969 and had been shown to work there for 42 years, as of 2011. There have been brief breaks however, as storylines have led to the character being fired or quitting her post. She was fired by Annie Walker ([[Doris Speed]]), who accused her of theft, and she quit her post in 1995 when [[Jack Duckworth|Jack]] ([[Bill Tarmey]]) and [[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Liz Dawn]]) took over as landlords. In the summer of 2009, Betty was sacked again temporarily by manager [[Poppy Morales]]. In a storyline that aired in February 2010, Betty \u2013 at 90 years old \u2013 was named Manchester's Oldest Barmaid. In a plot twist, a 91-year-old rival comes forward, resulting in Betty fearing she killed her, when the rival consumes a two-month-old hotpot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/a189560/poisoning-plot-for-corrie-legend-betty/|accessdate=1 April 2020|title=Poisoning plot for Corrie legend Betty|date=2 December 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nITV describe Betty as a \"lynchpin\" of the soap opera, stating that: \"She\u2019s as much a part of ''Coronation Street'' as the cobble stones.\"<ref name=\"itv\" /> Former executive producer, [[Brian Park]], suggested in 1997 that characters such as Betty \"are essential ingredients.

With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice \u2013 and, of course, those celebrated hotpots \u2013 at the Rovers Return for more than a generation.\"<ref name=\"thirty\"/> Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, \"It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back. Really, it has been a wonderful experience and I feel very glad I was able to stick around for so long.\"<ref name=\"thirty\"/>\n\nDriver was awarded a lifetime achievement award at ''[[The British Soap Awards]]'' in May 2010, to honour her role as Betty who had, at that time, featured in ''Coronation Street'' for 41 years. Due to illness, Driver was unable to collect the award in person, but she recorded a video message thanking everyone at ITV.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Betty's hotpot===\n[[File:Betty's hotpot.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Betty with her famous hotpot, outside The Rovers Return Inn.]]\nDuring her time on ''Coronation Street'', the character has become synonymous with her signature dish at the [[Rovers Return Inn]], [[Lancashire hotpot|Betty's hotpot]].
