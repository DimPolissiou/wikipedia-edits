However, it is verbose and uses over 300 [[reserved word]]s. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like {{code|1=y = x;|lang=c}}, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, {{code|MOVE x TO y|lang=cobolfree}}).\nCOBOL code is split into four ''divisions'' (identification, environment, data and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs and sentences. Lacking a large [[standard library]], the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.\n\nAcademic computer scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were not involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.brown.edu/~adf/programming_languages.html|title=A History of Computer Programming Languages|first=Andrew|last=Ferguson|date=|website=cs.brown.edu}}</ref>\nCOBOL has been criticized throughout its life for its verbosity, design process, and poor support for [[structured programming]]. These weaknesses result in monolithic and, though intended to be English-like, not easily comprehensible and verbose programs.\n\n==History and specification==\n===Background===\nIn the late 1950s, computer users and manufacturers were becoming concerned about the rising cost of programming. A 1959 survey had found that in any data processing installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000. At a time when new [[Timeline of programming languages|programming languages were proliferating]] at an ever-increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion would be far cheaper and faster.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=282}}\n\n[[File:Grace Hopper.jpg|thumb|alt=caption|[[Grace Hopper]], the inventor of [[FLOW-MATIC]], a predecessor to COBOL]]\n\nOn 8 April 1959, [[Mary K.

They agreed unanimously that more people should be able to program and that the new language should not be restricted by the limitations of contemporary technology. A majority agreed that the language should make maximal use of English, be capable of change, be machine-independent and be easy to use, even at the expense of power.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=286}}\n\nThe meeting resulted in the creation of a [[steering committee]] and short-, intermediate- and long-range committees. The short-range committee was given to September (three months) to produce specifications for an interim language, which would then be improved upon by the other committees.{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/9}}{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=201}} Their official mission, however, was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing programming languages and did not explicitly direct them to create a new language.{{sfn|Sammet|2004|p=104}}\nThe deadline was met with disbelief by the short-range committee.{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=132}}\nOne member, [[Betty Holberton]], described the three-month deadline as \"gross optimism\" and doubted that the language really would be a stopgap.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=288}}\n\nThe steering committee met on 4 June and agreed to name the entire activity as the ''Committee on Data Systems Languages'', or [[CODASYL]], and to form an executive committee.{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=203}}\n\nThe short-range committee was made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies.

While some members thought the language had too many compromises and was the result of [[design by committee]], others felt it was better than the three languages examined. Some felt the language was too complex; others, too simple.{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|pp=205\u2013206}}\nControversial features included those some considered useless or too advanced for data processing users. Such features included [[boolean expression]]s, [[formula]]s and table ''{{dfn|subscripts}}'' (indices).{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|loc=Figure 8}}{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|pp=230\u2013231}} Another point of controversy was whether to make keywords context-sensitive and the effect that would have on readability.{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|loc=Figure 8}} Although context-sensitive keywords were rejected, the approach was later used in [[PL/I]] and partially in COBOL from 2002.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|p=846}} Little consideration was given to [[interactivity]], interaction with [[operating system]]s (few existed at that time) and functions (thought of as purely mathematical and of no use in data processing).{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=220}}{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=228}}\n\nThe specifications were presented to the Executive Committee on 4 September.

The subcommittee was given until December to improve it.{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=132}}\n\nAt a mid-September meeting, the committee discussed the new language's name.

A reluctant short-term committee enacted a total cleanup and, by March 1963, it was reported that COBOL's syntax was as definable as [[ALGOL]]'s, although semantic ambiguities remained.{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=133}}\n\nEarly COBOL compilers were primitive and slow.

As a consequence of this English-like syntax, COBOL has over 300 [[keyword (computer programming)|keywords]].{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.9}}{{efn|Vendor-specific extensions cause many implementations to have far more: one implementation recognizes over 1,100 keywords.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://documentation.microfocus.com/help/topic/com.microfocus.eclipse.infocenter.visualcobol.vs2013/HRLHLHARES01U005.html | title=Reserved Words Table | publisher=[[Micro Focus]] | work=Micro Focus Visual COBOL 2.2 COBOL Language Reference | accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>}} Some of the keywords are simple alternative or pluralized spellings of the same word, which provides for more English-like statements and clauses; e.g., the {{code|IN}} and {{code|OF}} keywords can be used interchangeably, as can {{code|IS}} and {{code|ARE}}, and {{code|VALUE}} and {{code|VALUES}}.\n\nEach COBOL program is made up of four basic [[lexical items]]: words, literals, picture character-strings (see {{slink||PICTURE clause}}) and separators. Words include reserved words and user-defined identifiers. They are up to 31 characters long and may include letters, digits, hyphens and underscores. Literals include numerals (e.g. {{code|12}}) and strings (e.g. {{code|'Hello!'}}).{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.3.1.2}} Separators include the space character and commas and semi-colons followed by a space.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.3.2}}\n\nA COBOL program is split into four divisions: the identification division, the environment division, the data division and the procedure division. The identification division specifies the name and type of the source element and is where classes and interfaces are specified. The environment division specifies any program features that depend on the system running it, such as [[computer files|files]] and [[character sets]]. The data division is used to declare [[variable (computer science)|variable]]s and [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]s. The procedure division contains the program's [[statement (computer science)|statement]]s. Each division is sub-divided into sections, which are made up of paragraphs.\n\n====Metalanguage====\n\nCOBOL's syntax is usually described with a unique [[metalanguage]] using braces, brackets, bars and underlining. The metalanguage was developed for the original COBOL specifications. Although [[Backus\u2013Naur form]] did exist at the time, the committee had not heard of it.{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|p=349}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Elements of COBOL's metalanguage\n|-\n! Element\n! Appearance\n! Function\n|-\n|-\n| All capitals\n| EXAMPLE\n| Reserved word\n|-\n| Underlining\n| {{underline|EXAMPLE}}\n| The reserved word is compulsory\n|-\n| Braces\n| { }\n| Only one option may be selected\n|-\n| Brackets\n| []\n| Zero or one options may be selected\n|-\n| Ellipsis\n| ...\n| The preceding element may be repeated\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Bars\n| {{{pipe}} {{pipe}}}\n| One or more options may be selected. Any option may only be selected once.\n|-\n| [{{pipe}} {{pipe}}]\n| Zero or more options may be selected. Any option may only be selected once.\n|}\n\nAs an example, consider the following description of an <code>ADD</code> statement:\n\n<math>\n\\begin{array}{l}\n  \\underline{\\text{ADD}}\\,\n  \\begin{Bmatrix}\n    \\text{identifier-1} \\\\\n    \\text{literal-1}\n  \\end{Bmatrix}\\dots\n  \\;\\underline{\\text{TO}}\\,\\left\\{\\text{identifier-2}\\,\\left[\\,\\underline{\\text{ROUNDED}}\\,\\right]\\right\\}\\dots\n  \\\\\n\n  \\quad\n  \\left[\\left|\\begin{array}{l}\n     \\text{ON}\\,\\underline{\\text{SIZE}}\\,\\underline{\\text{ERROR}}\\,\\text{imperative-statement-1} \\\\\n     \\underline{\\text{NOT}}\\,\\text{ON}\\,\\underline{\\text{SIZE}}\\,\\underline{\\text{ERROR}}\\,\\text{imperative-statement-2} \\\\\n  \\end{array}\\right|\\right]\n  \\\\\n\n  \\quad\n  \\left[\\,\\underline{\\text{END-ADD}}\\,\\right]\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nThis description permits the following variants:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nADD 1 TO x\nADD 1, a, b TO x ROUNDED, y, z ROUNDED\n\nADD a, b TO c\n    ON SIZE ERROR\n        DISPLAY \"Error\"\nEND-ADD\n\nADD a TO b\n    NOT SIZE ERROR\n        DISPLAY \"No error\"\n    ON SIZE ERROR\n        DISPLAY \"Error\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Code format===\nCOBOL can be written in two formats: fixed (the default) or free. In fixed-format, code must be aligned to fit in certain areas (a hold-over from using punched cards). Until COBOL 2002, these were:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Column(s)\n! Usage\n|-\n| Sequence number area\n| 1\u20136\n| Originally used for card/line numbers, this area is ignored by the compiler\n|-\n| Indicator area\n| 7\n| The following characters are allowed here:\n* <code>*</code> \u2013 Comment line\n* <code>/</code> \u2013 Comment line that will be printed on a new page of a source listing\n* <code>-</code> \u2013 Continuation line, where words or literals from the previous line are continued\n* <code>D</code> \u2013 Line enabled in debugging mode, which is otherwise ignored\n|-\n| Area A\n| 8\u201311\n| This contains: <code>DIVISION</code>, <code>SECTION</code> and procedure headers; 01 and 77 level numbers and file/report descriptors\n|-\n| Area B\n| 12\u201372\n| Any other code not allowed in Area A\n|-\n| Program name area\n| 73\u2013\n| Historically up to column 80 for punched cards, it is used to identify the program or sequence the card belongs to\n|}\n\nIn COBOL 2002, Areas A and B were merged to form the program-text area, which now ends at an implementor-defined column.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|loc=\u00a7 F.2}}\n\nCOBOL 2002 also introduced free-format code. Free-format code can be placed in any column of the file, as in newer programming languages. Comments are specified using <code>*></code>, which can be placed anywhere and can also be used in fixed-format source code. Continuation lines are not present, and the <code>>>PAGE</code> directive replaces the <code>/</code> indicator.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|loc=\u00a7 F.2}}\n\n===Identification division===\nThe identification division identifies the following code entity and contains the definition of a class or interface.\n\n====Object-oriented programming====\n[[class (computer programming)|Classes]] and [[Interface (object-oriented programming)|interfaces]] have been in COBOL since 2002. Classes have factory objects, containing class [[method (computer programming)|methods]] and variables, and instance objects, containing instance methods and variables.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.18.2}} Inheritance and interfaces provide [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]. Support for [[generic programming]] is provided through parameterized classes, which can be instantiated to use any class or interface. Objects are stored as references which may be restricted to a certain type. There are two ways of calling a method: the {{code|INVOKE}} statement, which acts similarly to {{code|CALL}}, or through inline method invocation, which is analogous to using functions.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.18}}\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\n*> These are equivalent.\nINVOKE my-class \"foo\" RETURNING var\nMOVE my-class::\"foo\" TO var *> Inline method invocation\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nCOBOL does not provide a way to [[Member visibility|hide]] methods. Class data can be hidden, however, by declaring it without a [[property (programming)|{{code|PROPERTY}}]] clause, which leaves the user with no way to access it.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=108}} [[Method overloading]] was added in COBOL 2014.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=896}}\n\n===Environment division===\nThe environment division contains the configuration section and the input-output section. The configuration section is used to specify variable features such\nas currency signs, locales and character sets. The input-output section contains file-related information.\n\n====Files====\nCOBOL supports three file formats, or ''{{dfn|organizations}}'': sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, records are contiguous and must be traversed [[sequential access|sequentially]], similarly to a [[linked list]]. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be [[random access|randomly accessed]] and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a [[unique key]], but other, ''{{dfn|alternate}}'', record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as [[C-ISAM|C&#8209;ISAM]] and [[VSAM]], are based on IBM's [[ISAM]]. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, but they do not have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.2.1}}\n\nA common non-standard extension is the ''{{dfn|line sequential}}'' organization, used to process text files. Records in a file are terminated by a [[newline]] and may be of varying length.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://supportline.microfocus.com/documentation/books/nx30books/fhorgs.htm | title=File Organizations | publisher=Micro Focus | work=File Handling | date=1998 | accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Data division===\nThe data division is split into six sections which declare different items: the file section, for file records; the working-storage section, for [[static variable]]s; the local-storage section, for [[automatic variable]]s; the linkage section, for parameters and the return value; the report section and the screen section, for [[text-based user interface]]s.\n\n====Aggregated data====\nData items in COBOL are declared hierarchically through the use of level-numbers which indicate if a data item is part of another. An item with a higher level-number is subordinate to an item with a lower one. Top-level data items, with a level-number of 1, are called ''{{dfn|records}}''. Items that have subordinate aggregate data are called ''{{dfn|group items}}''; those that do not are called ''{{dfn|elementary items}}''. Level-numbers used to describe standard data items are between 1 and 49.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.5.1.2}}{{sfn|Cutler|2014|loc=Appendix A}}\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  some-record.                   *> Aggregate group record item\n           05  num            PIC 9(10).  *> Elementary item\n           05  the-date.                  *> Aggregate (sub)group record item\n               10  the-year   PIC 9(4).   *> Elementary item\n               10  the-month  PIC 99.     *> Elementary item\n               10  the-day    PIC 99.     *> Elementary item\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the above example, elementary item {{code|num}} and group item {{code|the-date}} are subordinate to the record {{code|some-record}}, while elementary items {{code|the-year}}, {{code|the-month}}, and {{code|the-day}} are part of the group item {{code|the-date}}.\n\nSubordinate items can be disambiguated with the {{code|IN}} (or {{code|OF}}) keyword. For example, consider the example code above along with the following example:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  sale-date.\n           05  the-year       PIC 9(4).\n           05  the-month      PIC 99.\n           05  the-day        PIC 99.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe names {{code|the-year}}, {{code|the-month}}, and {{code|the-day}} are ambiguous by themselves, since more than one data item is defined with those names. To specify a particular data item, for instance one of the items contained within the {{code|sale-date}} group, the programmer would use {{code|the-year IN sale-date}} (or the equivalent {{code|the-year OF sale-date}}). (This syntax is similar to the \"dot notation\" supported by most contemporary languages.)\n\n====Other data levels====\nA level-number of 66 is used to declare a re-grouping of previously defined items, irrespective of how those items are structured. This data level, also referred to by the associated {{dfn|{{code|RENAMES}} clause}}, is rarely used<ref>{{cite book | title=Sams Teach Yourself COBOL in 24 hours | publisher=[[Sams|SAMS Publishing]] | year=1999 | pages=40 | isbn=978-0672314537 | first=Thane | last=Hubbell | lccn=98087215}}</ref> and, circa 1988, was usually found in old programs. Its ability to ignore the hierarchical and logical structure data meant its use was not recommended and many installations forbade its use.{{sfn|McCracken|Golden|1988|loc=\u00a7 19.9}}\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  customer-record.\n           05  cust-key            PIC X(10).\n           05  cust-name.\n               10  cust-first-name PIC X(30).\n               10  cust-last-name  PIC X(30).\n           05  cust-dob            PIC 9(8).\n           05  cust-balance        PIC 9(7)V99.\n           \n       66  cust-personal-details   RENAMES cust-name THRU cust-dob.\n       66  cust-all-details        RENAMES cust-name THRU cust-balance.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA 77 level-number indicates the item is stand-alone, and in such situations is equivalent to the level-number 01. For example, the following code declares two 77-level data items, {{code|property-name}} and {{code|sales-region}}, which are non-group data items that are independent of (not subordinate to) any other data items:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       77  property-name      PIC X(80).\n       77  sales-region       PIC 9(5).\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn 88 level-number declares a ''{{dfn|condition name}}'' (a so-called 88-level) which is true when its parent data item contains one of the values specified in its {{code|VALUE}} clause.{{sfn|Cutler|2014|loc=\u00a7 5.8.5}} For example, the following code defines two 88-level condition-name items that are true or false depending on the current character data value of the {{code|wage-type}} data item. When the data item contains a value of {{code|'H'}}, the condition-name {{code|wage-is-hourly}} is true, whereas when it contains a value of {{code|'S'}} or {{code|'Y'}}, the condition-name {{code|wage-is-yearly}} is true. If the data item contains some other value, both of the condition-names are false.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  wage-type          PIC X.\n           88  wage-is-hourly VALUE \"H\".\n           88  wage-is-yearly VALUE \"S\", \"Y\".\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Data types====\nStandard COBOL provides the following data types:{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.5.2}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Numeric data is converted between different representations and sizes silently and alphanumeric data can be placed in any data item that can be stored as a string, including numeric and group data.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9.24}} In contrast, object references and pointers may only be assigned from items of the same type and their values may be restricted to a certain type.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9.35}}\n\n=====PICTURE clause=====\nA {{code|PICTURE}} (or {{code|PIC}}) clause is a string of characters, each of which represents a portion of the data item and what it may contain. Some picture characters specify the type of the item and how many characters or digits it occupies in memory. For example, a {{code|9}} indicates a decimal digit, and an {{code|S}} indicates that the item is [[signedness|signed]]. Other picture characters (called ''{{dfn|insertion}}'' and ''{{dfn|editing}}'' characters) specify how an item should be formatted. For example, a series of {{code|+}} characters define character positions as well as how a leading sign character is to be positioned within the final character data; the rightmost non-numeric character will contain the item's sign, while other character positions corresponding to a {{code|+}} to the left of this position will contain a space. Repeated characters can be specified more concisely by specifying a number in parentheses after a picture character; for example, {{code|9(7)}} is equivalent to {{code|9999999}}. Picture specifications containing only digit ({{code|9}}) and sign ({{code|S}}) characters define purely ''{{dfn|numeric}}'' data items, while picture specifications containing alphabetic ({{code|A}}) or alphanumeric ({{code|X}}) characters define ''{{dfn|alphanumeric}}'' data items. The presence of other formatting characters define ''{{dfn|edited numeric}}'' or ''{{dfn|edited alphanumeric}}'' data items.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 13.18.40}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n! {{code|PICTURE}} clause\n!

Depending on the data type, it can either complement or be used instead of a {{code|PICTURE}} clause. While it can be used to declare pointers and object references, it is mostly geared towards specifying numeric types. These numeric formats are:{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 13.18.60.3}}\n\n* Binary, where a minimum size is either specified by the <code>PICTURE</code> clause or by a <code>USAGE</code> clause such as <code>BINARY-LONG</code>.\n* {{code|USAGE COMPUTATIONAL|lang=cobolfree}}, where data may be stored in whatever format the implementation provides; often equivalent to &nbsp;{{code|USAGE BINARY|lang=cobolfree}}\n* {{code|USAGE DISPLAY|lang=cobolfree}}, the default format, where data is stored as a string\n* Floating-point, in either an implementation-dependent format or according to IEEE 754.\n* {{code|USAGE NATIONAL|lang=cobolfree}}, where data is stored as a string using an extended character set\n* {{code|USAGE PACKED-DECIMAL|lang=cobolfree}}, where data is stored in the smallest possible decimal format (typically [[packed binary-coded decimal]])\n\n====Report writer====\nThe report writer is a [[declarative programming|declarative facility]] for creating reports. The programmer need only specify the report layout and the data required to produce it, freeing them from having to write code to handle things like page breaks, data formatting, and headings and footings.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=855}}\n\nReports are associated with report files, which are files which may only be written to through report writer statements.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       FD  report-out REPORT sales-report.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nEach report is defined in the report section of the data division. A report is split into report groups which define the report's headings, footings and details. Reports work around hierarchical ''{{dfn|control breaks}}''. Control breaks occur when a key variable changes it value; for example, when creating a report detailing customers' orders, a control break could occur when the program reaches a different customer's orders. Here is an example report description for a report which gives a salesperson's sales and which warns of any invalid records:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       RD  sales-report\n           PAGE LIMITS 60 LINES\n           FIRST DETAIL 3\n           CONTROLS seller-name.\n\n       01  TYPE PAGE HEADING.\n           03  COL 1                    VALUE \"Sales Report\".\n           03  COL 74                   VALUE \"Page\".\n           03  COL 79                   PIC Z9 SOURCE PAGE-COUNTER.\n\n       01  sales-on-day TYPE DETAIL, LINE + 1.\n           03  COL 3                    VALUE \"Sales on\".\n           03  COL 12                   PIC 99/99/9999 SOURCE sales-date.\n           03  COL 21                   VALUE \"were\".\n           03  COL 26                   PIC $$$$9.99 SOURCE sales-amount.\n\n       01  invalid-sales TYPE DETAIL, LINE + 1.\n           03  COL 3                    VALUE \"INVALID RECORD:\".\n           03  COL 19                   PIC X(34) SOURCE sales-record.\n\n       01  TYPE CONTROL HEADING seller-name, LINE + 2.\n           03  COL 1                    VALUE \"Seller:\".\n           03  COL 9                    PIC X(30) SOURCE seller-name.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe above report description describes the following layout:\n<pre>\nSales Report                                                             Page  1\n\nSeller: Howard Bromberg\n  Sales on 10/12/2008 were $1000.00\n  Sales on 12/12/2008 were    $0.00\n  Sales on 13/12/2008 were   $31.47\n  INVALID RECORD: Howard Bromberg             XXXXYY\n\nSeller: Howard Discount\n...\nSales Report                                                            Page 12\n\n  Sales on 08/05/2014 were  $543.98\n  INVALID RECORD: William Selden      12O52014FOOFOO\n  Sales on 30/05/2014 were    $0.00\n</pre>\n\nFour statements control the report writer: {{code|INITIATE}}, which prepares the report writer for printing; {{code|GENERATE}}, which prints a report group; {{code|SUPPRESS}}, which suppresses the printing of a report group; and {{code|TERMINATE}}, which terminates report processing. For the above sales report example, the procedure division might look like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n           OPEN INPUT sales, OUTPUT report-out\n           INITIATE sales-report\n \n           PERFORM UNTIL 1 <> 1\n               READ sales\n                   AT END\n                       EXIT PERFORM\n               END-READ\n \n               VALIDATE sales-record\n               IF valid-record\n                   GENERATE sales-on-day\n               ELSE\n                   GENERATE invalid-sales\n               END-IF\n           END-PERFORM\n \n           TERMINATE sales-report\n           CLOSE sales, report-out\n           .\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nUse of the Report Writer facility tended to vary considerably; some organizations used it extensively and some not at all.{{sfn|McCracken|1976|p=338}}  In addition, implementations of Report Writer ranged in quality, with those at the lower end sometimes using excessive amounts of memory at runtime.{{sfn|McCracken|1976|p=338}}\n\n===Procedure division===\n\n====Procedures====\nThe sections and paragraphs in the procedure division (collectively called procedures) can be used as [[label (programming)|labels]] and as simple [[subroutines]]. Unlike in other divisions, paragraphs do not need to be in sections.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.4}}\nExecution goes down through the procedures of a program until it is terminated.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.6.3}}\nTo use procedures as subroutines, the {{code|PERFORM}} verb is used.\n\nA {{code|PERFORM}} statement somewhat resembles a procedure call in a modern language in the sense that execution returns to the code following the {{code|PERFORM}} statement at the end of the called code; however, it does not provide any mechanism for [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameter passing]] or for returning a result value. If a subroutine is invoked using a simple statement like {{code|PERFORM subroutine|lang=cobolfree}}, then control returns at the end of the called procedure. However, {{code|PERFORM}} is unusual in that it may be used to call a range spanning a sequence of several adjacent procedures. This is done with the {{code|PERFORM sub-1 THRU sub-n|lang=cobolfree}} construct:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nPROCEDURE so-and-so.\n    PERFORM ALPHA\n    PERFORM ALPHA THRU GAMMA\n    STOP RUN.\nALPHA.\n    DISPLAY 'A'.\nBETA.\n    DISPLAY 'B'.\nGAMMA.\n    DISPLAY 'C'.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe output of this program will be: \"A A B C\".\n\n{{code|PERFORM}} also differs from conventional procedure calls in that there is, at least traditionally, no notion of a call stack. As a consequence, nested invocations are possible (a sequence of code being {{code|PERFORM}}'ed may execute a {{code|PERFORM}} statement itself), but require extra care if parts of the same code are executed by both invocations. The problem arises when the code in the inner invocation reaches the exit point of the outer invocation. More formally, if control passes through the exit point of a {{code|PERFORM}} invocation that was called earlier but has not completed yet, the COBOL 2002 standard officially stipulates that the behaviour is [[Undefined behavior|undefined]].\n\nThe reason is that COBOL, rather than a \"return address\", operates with what may be called a continuation address. When control flow reaches the end of any procedure, the continuation address is looked up and control is transferred to that address. Before the program runs, the continuation address for every procedure is initialised to the start address of the procedure that comes next in the program text so that, if no {{code|PERFORM}} statements happen, control flows from top to bottom through the program. But when a {{code|PERFORM}} statement executes, it modifies the continuation address of the called procedure (or the last procedure of the called range, if {{code|PERFORM THRU}} was used), so that control will return to the call site at the end. The original value is saved and is restored afterwards, but there is only one storage position. If two nested invocations operate on overlapping code, they may interfere which each other's management of the continuation address in several ways.<ref name=\"FR99\">{{cite conference | url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ramali/Papers/paste99.pdf | title=Identifying Procedural Structure in Cobol Programs | doi=10.1145/381788.316163 | first1=John | last1=Field | first2=G. | last2=Ramalingam | conference=PASTE '99 | ISBN=1581131372 | conferenceurl=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/paste99.html | date=September 1999}}</ref><ref name=\"VV07\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~nveerman/research/minefield/minefield.pdf | title=Cobol minefield detection | journal=Software\u2014Practice and Experience |date=November 2006 | volume=36 | issue=14 | doi=10.1002/spe.v36:14 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306135410/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~nveerman/research/minefield/minefield.pdf | url-status=dead | archivedate=6 March 2007 | last1=Veerman | first1=Niels | last2=Verhoeven | first2=Ernst-Jan }}</ref>\n\nThe following example (taken from Veerman/Verhoeven, 2006) illustrates the problem:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nLABEL1.\n    DISPLAY '1'\n    PERFORM LABEL2 THRU LABEL3\n    STOP RUN.\nLABEL2.\n    DISPLAY '2'\n    PERFORM LABEL3 THRU LABEL4.\nLABEL3.\n    DISPLAY '3'.\nLABEL4.\n    DISPLAY '4'.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nOne might expect that the output of this program would be \"1 2 3 4 3\": After displaying \"2\", the second {{code|PERFORM}} causes \"3\" and \"4\" to be displayed, and then the first invocation continues on with \"3\". In traditional COBOL implementations, this is not the case. Rather, the first {{code|PERFORM}} statement sets the continuation address at the end of {{code|LABEL3}} so that it will jump back to the call site inside {{code|LABEL1}}. The second {{code|PERFORM}} statement sets the return at the end of {{code|LABEL4}} but does not modify the continuation address of {{code|LABEL3}}, expecting it to be the default continuation. Thus, when the inner invocation arrives at the end of {{code|LABEL3}}, it jumps back to the outer {{code|PERFORM}} statement, and the program stops having printed just \"1 2 3\". On the other hand, in some COBOL implementations like the open-source TinyCOBOL compiler, the two {{code|PERFORM}} statements do not interfere with each other and the output is indeed \"1 2 3 4 3\". Therefore, the behaviour in such cases is not only (perhaps) surprising, it is also not portable.<ref name=\"VV07\"/>\n\nA special consequence of this limitation is that {{code|PERFORM}} cannot be used to write recursive code. Another simple example to illustrate this (slightly simplified from Veerman/Verhoeven, 2006):\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\n    MOVE 1 TO A\n    PERFORM LABEL\n    STOP RUN.\nLABEL.\n    DISPLAY A\n    IF A < 3\n        ADD 1 TO A\n        PERFORM LABEL\n    END-IF\n    DISPLAY 'END'.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nOne might expect that the output is \"1 2 3 END END END\", and in fact that is what some COBOL compilers will produce. But some compilers, like IBM COBOL, will produce code that prints \"1 2 3 END END END END ...\" and so on, printing \"END\" over and over in an endless loop. Since there is limited space to store backup continuation addresses, the backups get overwritten in the course of recursive invocations, and all that can be restored is the jump back to {{code|DISPLAY 'END'}}.<ref name=\"VV07\"/>\n\n====Statements====\nCOBOL 2014 has 47 statements (also called ''{{dfn|verbs}}''),{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9}} which can be grouped into the following broad categories: control flow, I/O, data manipulation and the report writer. The report writer statements are covered in the [[#Report writer|report writer section]].\n\n=====Control flow=====\nCOBOL's [[conditional (computer programming)|conditional statements]] are {{code|IF}} and {{code|EVALUATE}}. {{code|EVALUATE}} is a [[switch statement|switch-like statement]] with the added capability of evaluating multiple values and conditions. This can be used to implement [[decision table]]s. For example, the following might be used to control a [[CNC lathe]]: <!-- a more common appliance would be more suitable. -->\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nEVALUATE TRUE ALSO desired-speed ALSO current-speed\n    WHEN lid-closed ALSO min-speed THRU max-speed ALSO LESS THAN desired-speed\n        PERFORM speed-up-machine\n    WHEN lid-closed ALSO min-speed THRU max-speed ALSO GREATER THAN desired-speed\n        PERFORM slow-down-machine\n    WHEN lid-open ALSO ANY ALSO NOT ZERO\n        PERFORM emergency-stop\n    WHEN OTHER\n        CONTINUE\nEND-EVALUATE\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe {{code|PERFORM}} statement is used to define loops which are executed {{em|until}} a condition is true (not {{em|while}} true, which is more common in other languages). It is also used to call procedures or ranges of procedures (see the [[#Procedures|procedures section]] for more details). {{code|CALL}} and {{code|INVOKE}} call subprograms and methods, respectively. The name of the subprogram/method is contained in a string which may be a literal or a data item.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7\u00a7 14.9.4, 14.9.22}} Parameters can be passed [[call by reference|by reference]], by content (where a copy is passed by reference) or [[call by value|by value]] (but only if a [[function prototype|prototype]] is available).{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.6.5.2.2}}\n{{code|CANCEL}} unloads subprograms from memory. {{code|GO TO}} causes the program to jump to a specified procedure.\n\nThe {{code|GOBACK}} statement is a [[return statement]] and the {{code|STOP}} statement stops the program. The {{code|EXIT}} statement has six different formats: it can be used as a return statement, a [[break statement]], a [[continue statement]], an end marker or to leave a procedure.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9.13.1}}\n\n[[Exception handling|Exceptions]] are raised by a {{code|RAISE}} statement and caught with a handler, or ''{{dfn|declarative}}'', defined in the {{code|DECLARATIVES}} portion of the procedure division. Declaratives are sections beginning with a {{code|USE}} statement which specify the errors to handle. Exceptions can be names or objects. {{code|RESUME}} is used in a declarative to jump to the statement after the one that raised the exception or to a procedure outside the {{code|DECLARATIVES}}. Unlike other languages, uncaught exceptions may not terminate the program and the program can proceed unaffected.\n\n=====I/O=====\nFile I/O is handled by the self-describing {{code|OPEN}}, {{code|CLOSE}}, {{code|READ}}, and {{code|WRITE}} statements along with a further three: {{code|REWRITE}}, which updates a record; {{code|START}}, which selects subsequent records to access by finding a record with a certain key; and {{code|UNLOCK}}, which releases a [[lock (database)|lock]] on the last record accessed.\n\nUser interaction is done using {{code|ACCEPT}} and {{code|DISPLAY}}.\n\n=====Data manipulation=====\nThe following verbs manipulate data:\n* {{code|INITIALIZE}}, which sets data items to their default values.\n* {{code|MOVE}}, which [[assignment (computer science)|assigns]] values to data items ; ''MOVE CORRESPONDING'' assigns corresponding like-named [[Record (computer science)#COBOL|fields]].\n* {{code|SET}}, which has 15 formats: it can modify indices, assign object references and alter table capacities, among other functions.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a714.9.35.1}}\n* {{code|ADD}}, {{code|SUBTRACT}}, {{code|MULTIPLY}}, {{code|DIVIDE}}, and {{code|COMPUTE}}, which handle arithmetic (with {{code|COMPUTE}} assigning the result of a formula to a variable).\n* {{code|ALLOCATE}} and {{code|FREE}}, which handle [[dynamic memory]].\n* {{code|VALIDATE}}, which validates and distributes data as specified in an item's description in the data division.\n* {{code|STRING}} and {{code|UNSTRING}}, which [[Concatenation|concatenate]] and split [[string (computer science)|string]]s, respectively.\n* {{code|INSPECT}}, which tallies or replaces instances of specified [[substring]]s within a string.\n* {{code|SEARCH}}, which searches a table for the first entry satisfying a condition.\n\nFiles and tables are sorted using {{code|SORT}} and the {{code|MERGE}} verb merges and sorts files. The {{code|RELEASE}} verb provides records to sort and {{code|RETURN}} retrieves sorted records in order.\n\n====Scope termination====\nSome statements, such as {{code|IF}} and {{code|READ}}, may themselves contain statements. Such statements may be terminated in two ways: by a period (''{{dfn|implicit termination}}''), which terminates ''all'' unterminated statements contained, or by a scope terminator, which terminates the nearest matching open statement.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\n*> Terminator period (\"implicit termination\")\nIF invalid-record\n    IF no-more-records\n        NEXT SENTENCE\n    ELSE\n        READ record-file\n            AT END SET no-more-records TO TRUE.\n\n*> Scope terminators (\"explicit termination\")\nIF invalid-record\n    IF no-more-records\n        CONTINUE\n    ELSE\n        READ record-file\n            AT END SET no-more-records TO TRUE\n        END-READ\n    END-IF\nEND-IF\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nNested statements terminated with a period are a common source of bugs.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=899}}{{sfn|McCracken|Golden|1988|loc=\u00a7 8.4}} For example, examine the following code:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nIF x\n    DISPLAY y.\n    DISPLAY z.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nHere, the intent is to display <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> if condition <code>x</code> is true. However, <code>z</code> will be displayed whatever the value of <code>x</code> because the <code>IF</code> statement is terminated by an erroneous period after {{code|DISPLAY y|lang=cobolfree}}.\n\nAnother bug is a result of the [[dangling else problem]], when two <code>IF</code> statements can associate with an <code>ELSE</code>.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nIF x\n    IF y\n        DISPLAY a\nELSE\n    DISPLAY b.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the above fragment, the <code>ELSE</code> associates with the &nbsp;{{code|IF y|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; statement instead of the &nbsp;{{code|IF x|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; statement, causing a bug. Prior to the introduction of explicit scope terminators, preventing it would require &nbsp;{{code|ELSE NEXT SENTENCE|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; to be placed after the inner <code>IF</code>.{{sfn|McCracken|Golden|1988|loc=\u00a7 8.4}}\n\n====Self-modifying code====\nThe original (1959) COBOL specification supported the infamous &nbsp;{{code|ALTER X TO PROCEED TO Y|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; statement, for which many compilers generated [[self-modifying code]]. <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are procedure labels, and the single &nbsp;{{code|GO TO|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; statement in procedure <code>X</code> executed after such an {{code|ALTER}} statement means &nbsp;{{code|GO TO Y|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; instead. Many compilers still support it,<ref>Examples of compiler support for {{code|ALTER}} can be seen in the following:\n\n* {{cite web\n |last=Tiffin \n |first=Brian \n |title=September 2014 \n |url=http://sourceforge.net/p/open-cobol/discussion/cobol/thread/7dc2941f/#5ee9 \n |work=GNU Cobol \n |date=18 September 2013 \n |accessdate=5 January 2014 \n}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=http://documentation.microfocus.com/help/topic/com.microfocus.eclipse.infocenter.visualcobol.vs2013/HRLHLHPDF803.html \n |title=The ALTER Statement \n |publisher=Micro Focus \n |work=Micro Focus Visual COBOL 2.2 for Visual Studio 2013 COBOL Language Reference \n |accessdate=5 January 2014 \n}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=http://www.csim.scu.edu.tw/~kuo/COBOL/COBOLCompiler/COBOL%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8A/cob_lrf.pdf \n |title=ALTER Statement (Nucleus) \n |publisher=Fujitsu \n |work=COBOL85 Reference Manual \n |date=November 1996 \n |accessdate=5 January 2014 \n |page=555 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106031540/http://www.csim.scu.edu.tw/~kuo/COBOL/COBOLCompiler/COBOL%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8A/cob_lrf.pdf \n |archivedate=6 January 2014 \n |url-status=dead \n}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/pdthelp/v1r1/topic/com.ibm.entcobol.doc_5.1/PGandLR/ref/rlpsalte.html \n |title=ALTER Statement \n |publisher=IBM \n |work=Enterprise COBOL for z/OS Language Reference \n |date=June 2013 \n |accessdate=5 January 2014 \n}}</ref>\nbut it was deemed [[deprecation|obsolete]] in the COBOL 1985 standard and deleted in 2002.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|loc=\u00a7 F.1}}\n\nThe {{code|ALTER}} statement was poorly regarded because it undermined \"locality of context\" and made a program's overall logic difficult to comprehend.{{sfn|McCracken|1976|p=355}}  As textbook author [[Daniel D.

[[Edsger Dijkstra]], a preeminent computer scientist, wrote a [[letter to the editor]] of [[Communications of the ACM]], published 1975 entitled \"How do we tell truths that might hurt?\", in which he was critical of COBOL and several other contemporary languages; remarking that \"the use of COBOL cripples the mind\".<ref name=\"Dijkstra1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD498.html|title=How do we tell truths that might hurt?|accessdate=29 August 2007|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|date=18 June 1975|author=Dijkstra, Edsger W.|id=EWD498|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502143353/http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD498.html|archive-date=2 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nIn a published dissent to Dijkstra's remarks, the computer scientist Howard E. Tompkins claimed that [[unstructured programming|unstructured]] COBOL tended to be \"written by programmers that have never had the benefit of structured COBOL taught well\", arguing that the issue was primarily one of training.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1145/948176.948186| title = In defense of teaching structured COBOL as computer science| journal = ACM SIGPLAN Notices| volume = 18| issue = 4| pages = 86\u201394| year = 1983| last1 = Tompkins | first1 = H. E. }}</ref>\n\nOne cause of [[spaghetti code]] was the {{code|GO TO}} statement. Attempts to remove {{code|GO TO}}s from COBOL code, however, resulted in convoluted programs and reduced code quality.{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=125}} {{code|GO TO}}s were largely replaced by the {{code|PERFORM}} statement and procedures, which promoted [[modular programming]]{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=125}} and gave easy access to powerful looping facilities. However, {{code|PERFORM}} could only be used with procedures so loop bodies were not located where they were used, making programs harder to understand.{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|pp=349\u2013350}}\n\nCOBOL programs were infamous for being monolithic and lacking modularization.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJmJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4 | title=Beginning COBOL for Programmers | publisher=Apress | accessdate=13 August 2014 | page=4 | first=Michael | last=Coughlan | isbn=978-1430262534 | date=16 March 2014}}</ref>\nCOBOL code could only be modularized through procedures, which were found to be inadequate for large systems. It was impossible to restrict access to data, meaning a procedure could access and modify {{em|any}} data item. Furthermore, there was no way to pass [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]s to a procedure, an omission Jean Sammet regarded as the committee's biggest mistake.{{sfn|Sammet|1978b|p=258}}\nAnother complication stemmed from the ability to {{code|PERFORM THRU}} a specified sequence of procedures. This meant that control could jump to and return from any procedure, creating convoluted control flow and permitting a programmer to break the [[single-entry single-exit]] rule.{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=126}}\n\nThis situation improved as COBOL adopted more features. COBOL-74 added subprograms, giving programmers the ability to control the data each part of the program could access. COBOL-85 then added nested subprograms, allowing programmers to hide subprograms.{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=127}} Further control over data and code came in 2002 when object-oriented programming, user-defined functions and user-defined data types were included.\n\nNevertheless, much important legacy COBOL software uses unstructured code, which has become unmaintainable. It can be too risky and costly to modify even a simple section of code, since it may be used from unknown places in unknown ways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2016/07/cobol-and-legacy-code-as-a-systemic-risk.html?imm_mid=0e6043&cmp=em-prog-na-na-newsltr_20160723|title=COBOL and Legacy Code as a Systemic Risk {{!}} naked capitalism|date=19 July 2016|language=en-US|access-date=23 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Compatibility issues===\nCOBOL was intended to be a highly portable, \"common\" language. However, by 2001, around 300 dialects had been created.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/grammarware/500/500.pdf | title=Cracking the 500-language problem | journal=IEEE Software |date=November\u2013December 2001 | volume=18 | issue=6 | page=79 | doi=10.1109/52.965809 | first1=Ralf | last1=L\u00e4mmel | first2=Chris | last2=Verhoef | author-link2 = Chris Verhoef| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085841/http://www.cs.vu.nl/grammarware/500/500.pdf | archivedate=19 August 2014 | url-status=dead}}</ref> One source of dialects was the standard itself: the 1974 standard was composed of one mandatory nucleus and eleven functional modules, each containing two or three levels of support.

Brophy, the [[Chief Information Officer|CIO]] of [[St. Paul Travelers|Travelers Insurance]], spearheaded an effort to inform COBOL users of the heavy reprogramming costs of implementing the new standard.{{sfn|Garfunkel|1987|p=11}} As a result, the ANSI COBOL Committee received more than 2,200 letters from the public, mostly negative, requiring the committee to make changes. On the other hand, conversion to COBOL-85 was thought to increase productivity in future years, thus justifying the conversion costs.{{sfn|Garfunkel|1987|p=15}}\n\n===Verbose syntax===\n{{quotebox\n | title=COBOL: /koh\u2032bol/, n.\n | tstyle=text-align: left;\n | quote=A weak, verbose, and flabby language used by code grinders to do boring mindless things on dinosaur mainframes.

Proponents say that this was intended to make the code [[self-documenting]], easing program maintenance.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=53}} COBOL was also intended to be easy for programmers to learn and use,{{sfn|CODASYL|1969|loc=\u00a7 II.1.1}} while still being readable to non-technical staff such as managers.{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|p=350}}{{sfn|Sammet|1961|p=381}}{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/10}}{{sfn|Marcotty|1978|p=263}}\nThe desire for readability led to the use of English-like syntax and structural elements, such as nouns, verbs, clauses, sentences, sections, and divisions. Yet by 1984, maintainers of COBOL programs were struggling to deal with \"incomprehensible\" code{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/10}} and the main changes in COBOL-85 were there to help ease maintenance.<ref name=\"Computerworld Garfunkel\" />\n\nJean Sammet, a short-range committee member, noted that \"little attempt was made to cater to the professional programmer, in fact people whose main interest is programming tend to be very unhappy with COBOL\" which she attributed to COBOL's verbose syntax.{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/14}}\n\n===Isolation from the computer science community===\nThe COBOL community has always been isolated from the computer science community. No academic computer scientists participated in the design of COBOL: all of those on the committee came from commerce or government. Computer scientists at the time were more interested in fields like numerical analysis, physics and system programming than the commercial file-processing problems which COBOL development tackled.{{sfn|Sammet|1961|p=380}} Jean Sammet attributed COBOL's unpopularity to an initial \"snob reaction\" due to its inelegance, the lack of influential computer scientists participating in the design process and a disdain for business data processing.{{sfn|Marcotty|1978|p=266}} The COBOL specification used a unique \"notation\", or [[metalanguage]], to define its syntax rather than the new [[Backus\u2013Naur form]] which the committee did not know of. This resulted in \"severe\" criticism.{{sfn|Sammet|1978b|p=255}}{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|pp=348\u2013349}}{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=133}}\n\nLater, COBOL suffered from a shortage of material covering it; it took until 1963 for introductory books to appear (with Richard D.

However, it is verbose and uses over 300 [[reserved word]]s. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like {{code|1=y = x;|lang=c}}, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, {{code|MOVE x TO y|lang=cobolfree}}).\nCOBOL code is split into four ''divisions'' (identification, environment, data and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs and sentences. Lacking a large [[standard library]], the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.\n\nAcademic computer scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were not involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.brown.edu/~adf/programming_languages.html|title=A History of Computer Programming Languages|first=Andrew|last=Ferguson|date=|website=cs.brown.edu}}</ref>\nCOBOL has been criticized throughout its life for its verbosity, design process, and poor support for [[structured programming]]. These weaknesses result in monolithic and, though intended to be English-like, not easily comprehensible and verbose programs.\n\n==History and specification==\n===Background===\nIn the late 1950s, computer users and manufacturers were becoming concerned about the rising cost of programming. A 1959 survey had found that in any data processing installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000. At a time when new [[Timeline of programming languages|programming languages were proliferating]] at an ever-increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion would be far cheaper and faster.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=282}}\n\n[[File:Grace Hopper.jpg|thumb|alt=caption|[[Grace Hopper]], the inventor of [[FLOW-MATIC]], a predecessor to COBOL]]\n\nOn 8 April 1959, [[Mary K.

[[FORTRAN]], the only mainstream language at the time, lacked the features needed to write such programs.{{sfn|Sammet|2004|p=104}}\n\nRepresentatives enthusiastically described a language that could work in a wide variety of environments, from banking and insurance to utilities and inventory control. They agreed unanimously that more people should be able to program and that the new language should not be restricted by the limitations of contemporary technology. A majority agreed that the language should make maximal use of English, be capable of change, be machine-independent and be easy to use, even at the expense of power.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=286}}\n\nThe meeting resulted in the creation of a [[steering committee]] and short-, intermediate- and long-range committees. The short-range committee was given to September (three months) to produce specifications for an interim language, which would then be improved upon by the other committees.{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/9}}{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=201}} Their official mission, however, was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing programming languages and did not explicitly direct them to create a new language.{{sfn|Sammet|2004|p=104}}\nThe deadline was met with disbelief by the short-range committee.{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=132}}\nOne member, [[Betty Holberton]], described the three-month deadline as \"gross optimism\" and doubted that the language really would be a stopgap.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=288}}\n\nThe steering committee met on 4 June and agreed to name the entire activity as the ''Committee on Data Systems Languages'', or [[CODASYL]], and to form an executive committee.{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=203}}\n\nThe short-range committee was made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies.

For example, a condition can be expressed as &nbsp;{{code|x IS GREATER THAN y|lang=cobolfree}} or more concisely as &nbsp;{{code|x GREATER y|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; or &nbsp;{{code|x > y|lang=cobolfree}}. More complex conditions can be \"abbreviated\" by removing repeated conditions and variables. For example, &nbsp;{{code|1=a > b AND a > c OR a = d|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; can be shortened to {{code|1=a > b AND c OR = d|lang=cobolfree}}. As a consequence of this English-like syntax, COBOL has over 300 [[keyword (computer programming)|keywords]].{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.9}}{{efn|Vendor-specific extensions cause many implementations to have far more: one implementation recognizes over 1,100 keywords.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://documentation.microfocus.com/help/topic/com.microfocus.eclipse.infocenter.visualcobol.vs2013/HRLHLHARES01U005.html | title=Reserved Words Table | publisher=[[Micro Focus]] | work=Micro Focus Visual COBOL 2.2 COBOL Language Reference | accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>}} Some of the keywords are simple alternative or pluralized spellings of the same word, which provides for more English-like statements and clauses; e.g., the {{code|IN}} and {{code|OF}} keywords can be used interchangeably, as can {{code|IS}} and {{code|ARE}}, and {{code|VALUE}} and {{code|VALUES}}.\n\nEach COBOL program is made up of four basic [[lexical items]]: words, literals, picture character-strings (see {{slink||PICTURE clause}}) and separators. Words include reserved words and user-defined identifiers. They are up to 31 characters long and may include letters, digits, hyphens and underscores. Literals include numerals (e.g. {{code|12}}) and strings (e.g. {{code|'Hello!'}}).{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.3.1.2}} Separators include the space character and commas and semi-colons followed by a space.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.3.2}}\n\nA COBOL program is split into four divisions: the identification division, the environment division, the data division and the procedure division. The identification division specifies the name and type of the source element and is where classes and interfaces are specified. The environment division specifies any program features that depend on the system running it, such as [[computer files|files]] and [[character sets]]. The data division is used to declare [[variable (computer science)|variable]]s and [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]s. The procedure division contains the program's [[statement (computer science)|statement]]s. Each division is sub-divided into sections, which are made up of paragraphs.\n\n====Metalanguage====\n\nCOBOL's syntax is usually described with a unique [[metalanguage]] using braces, brackets, bars and underlining. The metalanguage was developed for the original COBOL specifications. Although [[Backus\u2013Naur form]] did exist at the time, the committee had not heard of it.{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|p=349}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Elements of COBOL's metalanguage\n|-\n! Element\n! Appearance\n! Function\n|-\n|-\n| All capitals\n| EXAMPLE\n| Reserved word\n|-\n| Underlining\n| {{underline|EXAMPLE}}\n| The reserved word is compulsory\n|-\n| Braces\n| { }\n| Only one option may be selected\n|-\n| Brackets\n| []\n| Zero or one options may be selected\n|-\n| Ellipsis\n| ...\n| The preceding element may be repeated\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Bars\n| {{{pipe}} {{pipe}}}\n| One or more options may be selected. Any option may only be selected once.\n|-\n| [{{pipe}} {{pipe}}]\n| Zero or more options may be selected. Any option may only be selected once.\n|}\n\nAs an example, consider the following description of an <code>ADD</code> statement:\n\n<math>\n\\begin{array}{l}\n  \\underline{\\text{ADD}}\\,\n  \\begin{Bmatrix}\n    \\text{identifier-1} \\\\\n    \\text{literal-1}\n  \\end{Bmatrix}\\dots\n  \\;\\underline{\\text{TO}}\\,\\left\\{\\text{identifier-2}\\,\\left[\\,\\underline{\\text{ROUNDED}}\\,\\right]\\right\\}\\dots\n  \\\\\n\n  \\quad\n  \\left[\\left|\\begin{array}{l}\n     \\text{ON}\\,\\underline{\\text{SIZE}}\\,\\underline{\\text{ERROR}}\\,\\text{imperative-statement-1} \\\\\n     \\underline{\\text{NOT}}\\,\\text{ON}\\,\\underline{\\text{SIZE}}\\,\\underline{\\text{ERROR}}\\,\\text{imperative-statement-2} \\\\\n  \\end{array}\\right|\\right]\n  \\\\\n\n  \\quad\n  \\left[\\,\\underline{\\text{END-ADD}}\\,\\right]\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nThis description permits the following variants:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nADD 1 TO x\nADD 1, a, b TO x ROUNDED, y, z ROUNDED\n\nADD a, b TO c\n    ON SIZE ERROR\n        DISPLAY \"Error\"\nEND-ADD\n\nADD a TO b\n    NOT SIZE ERROR\n        DISPLAY \"No error\"\n    ON SIZE ERROR\n        DISPLAY \"Error\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Code format===\nCOBOL can be written in two formats: fixed (the default) or free. In fixed-format, code must be aligned to fit in certain areas (a hold-over from using punched cards). Until COBOL 2002, these were:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Column(s)\n! Usage\n|-\n| Sequence number area\n| 1\u20136\n| Originally used for card/line numbers, this area is ignored by the compiler\n|-\n| Indicator area\n| 7\n| The following characters are allowed here:\n* <code>*</code> \u2013 Comment line\n* <code>/</code> \u2013 Comment line that will be printed on a new page of a source listing\n* <code>-</code> \u2013 Continuation line, where words or literals from the previous line are continued\n* <code>D</code> \u2013 Line enabled in debugging mode, which is otherwise ignored\n|-\n| Area A\n| 8\u201311\n| This contains: <code>DIVISION</code>, <code>SECTION</code> and procedure headers; 01 and 77 level numbers and file/report descriptors\n|-\n| Area B\n| 12\u201372\n| Any other code not allowed in Area A\n|-\n| Program name area\n| 73\u2013\n| Historically up to column 80 for punched cards, it is used to identify the program or sequence the card belongs to\n|}\n\nIn COBOL 2002, Areas A and B were merged to form the program-text area, which now ends at an implementor-defined column.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|loc=\u00a7 F.2}}\n\nCOBOL 2002 also introduced free-format code. Free-format code can be placed in any column of the file, as in newer programming languages. Comments are specified using <code>*></code>, which can be placed anywhere and can also be used in fixed-format source code. Continuation lines are not present, and the <code>>>PAGE</code> directive replaces the <code>/</code> indicator.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|loc=\u00a7 F.2}}\n\n===Identification division===\nThe identification division identifies the following code entity and contains the definition of a class or interface.\n\n====Object-oriented programming====\n[[class (computer programming)|Classes]] and [[Interface (object-oriented programming)|interfaces]] have been in COBOL since 2002. Classes have factory objects, containing class [[method (computer programming)|methods]] and variables, and instance objects, containing instance methods and variables.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.18.2}} Inheritance and interfaces provide [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]. Support for [[generic programming]] is provided through parameterized classes, which can be instantiated to use any class or interface. Objects are stored as references which may be restricted to a certain type. There are two ways of calling a method: the {{code|INVOKE}} statement, which acts similarly to {{code|CALL}}, or through inline method invocation, which is analogous to using functions.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.18}}\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\n*> These are equivalent.\nINVOKE my-class \"foo\" RETURNING var\nMOVE my-class::\"foo\" TO var *> Inline method invocation\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nCOBOL does not provide a way to [[Member visibility|hide]] methods. Class data can be hidden, however, by declaring it without a [[property (programming)|{{code|PROPERTY}}]] clause, which leaves the user with no way to access it.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=108}} [[Method overloading]] was added in COBOL 2014.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=896}}\n\n===Environment division===\nThe environment division contains the configuration section and the input-output section. The configuration section is used to specify variable features such\nas currency signs, locales and character sets. The input-output section contains file-related information.\n\n====Files====\nCOBOL supports three file formats, or ''{{dfn|organizations}}'': sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, records are contiguous and must be traversed [[sequential access|sequentially]], similarly to a [[linked list]]. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be [[random access|randomly accessed]] and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a [[unique key]], but other, ''{{dfn|alternate}}'', record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as [[C-ISAM|C&#8209;ISAM]] and [[VSAM]], are based on IBM's [[ISAM]]. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, but they do not have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.2.1}}\n\nA common non-standard extension is the ''{{dfn|line sequential}}'' organization, used to process text files. Records in a file are terminated by a [[newline]] and may be of varying length.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://supportline.microfocus.com/documentation/books/nx30books/fhorgs.htm | title=File Organizations | publisher=Micro Focus | work=File Handling | date=1998 | accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Data division===\nThe data division is split into six sections which declare different items: the file section, for file records; the working-storage section, for [[static variable]]s; the local-storage section, for [[automatic variable]]s; the linkage section, for parameters and the return value; the report section and the screen section, for [[text-based user interface]]s.\n\n====Aggregated data====\nData items in COBOL are declared hierarchically through the use of level-numbers which indicate if a data item is part of another. An item with a higher level-number is subordinate to an item with a lower one. Top-level data items, with a level-number of 1, are called ''{{dfn|records}}''. Items that have subordinate aggregate data are called ''{{dfn|group items}}''; those that do not are called ''{{dfn|elementary items}}''. Level-numbers used to describe standard data items are between 1 and 49.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.5.1.2}}{{sfn|Cutler|2014|loc=Appendix A}}\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  some-record.                   *> Aggregate group record item\n           05  num            PIC 9(10).  *> Elementary item\n           05  the-date.                  *> Aggregate (sub)group record item\n               10  the-year   PIC 9(4).   *> Elementary item\n               10  the-month  PIC 99.     *> Elementary item\n               10  the-day    PIC 99.     *> Elementary item\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the above example, elementary item {{code|num}} and group item {{code|the-date}} are subordinate to the record {{code|some-record}}, while elementary items {{code|the-year}}, {{code|the-month}}, and {{code|the-day}} are part of the group item {{code|the-date}}.\n\nSubordinate items can be disambiguated with the {{code|IN}} (or {{code|OF}}) keyword. For example, consider the example code above along with the following example:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  sale-date.\n           05  the-year       PIC 9(4).\n           05  the-month      PIC 99.\n           05  the-day        PIC 99.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe names {{code|the-year}}, {{code|the-month}}, and {{code|the-day}} are ambiguous by themselves, since more than one data item is defined with those names. To specify a particular data item, for instance one of the items contained within the {{code|sale-date}} group, the programmer would use {{code|the-year IN sale-date}} (or the equivalent {{code|the-year OF sale-date}}). (This syntax is similar to the \"dot notation\" supported by most contemporary languages.)\n\n====Other data levels====\nA level-number of 66 is used to declare a re-grouping of previously defined items, irrespective of how those items are structured. This data level, also referred to by the associated {{dfn|{{code|RENAMES}} clause}}, is rarely used<ref>{{cite book | title=Sams Teach Yourself COBOL in 24 hours | publisher=[[Sams|SAMS Publishing]] | year=1999 | pages=40 | isbn=978-0672314537 | first=Thane | last=Hubbell | lccn=98087215}}</ref> and, circa 1988, was usually found in old programs. Its ability to ignore the hierarchical and logical structure data meant its use was not recommended and many installations forbade its use.{{sfn|McCracken|Golden|1988|loc=\u00a7 19.9}}\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  customer-record.\n           05  cust-key            PIC X(10).\n           05  cust-name.\n               10  cust-first-name PIC X(30).\n               10  cust-last-name  PIC X(30).\n           05  cust-dob            PIC 9(8).\n           05  cust-balance        PIC 9(7)V99.\n           \n       66  cust-personal-details   RENAMES cust-name THRU cust-dob.\n       66  cust-all-details        RENAMES cust-name THRU cust-balance.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA 77 level-number indicates the item is stand-alone, and in such situations is equivalent to the level-number 01. For example, the following code declares two 77-level data items, {{code|property-name}} and {{code|sales-region}}, which are non-group data items that are independent of (not subordinate to) any other data items:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       77  property-name      PIC X(80).\n       77  sales-region       PIC 9(5).\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn 88 level-number declares a ''{{dfn|condition name}}'' (a so-called 88-level) which is true when its parent data item contains one of the values specified in its {{code|VALUE}} clause.{{sfn|Cutler|2014|loc=\u00a7 5.8.5}} For example, the following code defines two 88-level condition-name items that are true or false depending on the current character data value of the {{code|wage-type}} data item. When the data item contains a value of {{code|'H'}}, the condition-name {{code|wage-is-hourly}} is true, whereas when it contains a value of {{code|'S'}} or {{code|'Y'}}, the condition-name {{code|wage-is-yearly}} is true. If the data item contains some other value, both of the condition-names are false.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  wage-type          PIC X.\n           88  wage-is-hourly VALUE \"H\".\n           88  wage-is-yearly VALUE \"S\", \"Y\".\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Data types====\nStandard COBOL provides the following data types:{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.5.2}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Numeric data is converted between different representations and sizes silently and alphanumeric data can be placed in any data item that can be stored as a string, including numeric and group data.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9.24}} In contrast, object references and pointers may only be assigned from items of the same type and their values may be restricted to a certain type.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9.35}}\n\n=====PICTURE clause=====\nA {{code|PICTURE}} (or {{code|PIC}}) clause is a string of characters, each of which represents a portion of the data item and what it may contain. Some picture characters specify the type of the item and how many characters or digits it occupies in memory. For example, a {{code|9}} indicates a decimal digit, and an {{code|S}} indicates that the item is [[signedness|signed]]. Other picture characters (called ''{{dfn|insertion}}'' and ''{{dfn|editing}}'' characters) specify how an item should be formatted. For example, a series of {{code|+}} characters define character positions as well as how a leading sign character is to be positioned within the final character data; the rightmost non-numeric character will contain the item's sign, while other character positions corresponding to a {{code|+}} to the left of this position will contain a space. Repeated characters can be specified more concisely by specifying a number in parentheses after a picture character; for example, {{code|9(7)}} is equivalent to {{code|9999999}}. Picture specifications containing only digit ({{code|9}}) and sign ({{code|S}}) characters define purely ''{{dfn|numeric}}'' data items, while picture specifications containing alphabetic ({{code|A}}) or alphanumeric ({{code|X}}) characters define ''{{dfn|alphanumeric}}'' data items. The presence of other formatting characters define ''{{dfn|edited numeric}}'' or ''{{dfn|edited alphanumeric}}'' data items.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 13.18.40}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n! {{code|PICTURE}} clause\n!

Depending on the data type, it can either complement or be used instead of a {{code|PICTURE}} clause. While it can be used to declare pointers and object references, it is mostly geared towards specifying numeric types. These numeric formats are:{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 13.18.60.3}}\n\n* Binary, where a minimum size is either specified by the <code>PICTURE</code> clause or by a <code>USAGE</code> clause such as <code>BINARY-LONG</code>.\n* {{code|USAGE COMPUTATIONAL|lang=cobolfree}}, where data may be stored in whatever format the implementation provides; often equivalent to &nbsp;{{code|USAGE BINARY|lang=cobolfree}}\n* {{code|USAGE DISPLAY|lang=cobolfree}}, the default format, where data is stored as a string\n* Floating-point, in either an implementation-dependent format or according to IEEE 754.\n* {{code|USAGE NATIONAL|lang=cobolfree}}, where data is stored as a string using an extended character set\n* {{code|USAGE PACKED-DECIMAL|lang=cobolfree}}, where data is stored in the smallest possible decimal format (typically [[packed binary-coded decimal]])\n\n====Report writer====\nThe report writer is a [[declarative programming|declarative facility]] for creating reports. The programmer need only specify the report layout and the data required to produce it, freeing them from having to write code to handle things like page breaks, data formatting, and headings and footings.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=855}}\n\nReports are associated with report files, which are files which may only be written to through report writer statements.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       FD  report-out REPORT sales-report.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nEach report is defined in the report section of the data division. A report is split into report groups which define the report's headings, footings and details. Reports work around hierarchical ''{{dfn|control breaks}}''. Control breaks occur when a key variable changes it value; for example, when creating a report detailing customers' orders, a control break could occur when the program reaches a different customer's orders. Here is an example report description for a report which gives a salesperson's sales and which warns of any invalid records:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       RD  sales-report\n           PAGE LIMITS 60 LINES\n           FIRST DETAIL 3\n           CONTROLS seller-name.\n\n       01  TYPE PAGE HEADING.\n           03  COL 1                    VALUE \"Sales Report\".\n           03  COL 74                   VALUE \"Page\".\n           03  COL 79                   PIC Z9 SOURCE PAGE-COUNTER.\n\n       01  sales-on-day TYPE DETAIL, LINE + 1.\n           03  COL 3                    VALUE \"Sales on\".\n           03  COL 12                   PIC 99/99/9999 SOURCE sales-date.\n           03  COL 21                   VALUE \"were\".\n           03  COL 26                   PIC $$$$9.99 SOURCE sales-amount.\n\n       01  invalid-sales TYPE DETAIL, LINE + 1.\n           03  COL 3                    VALUE \"INVALID RECORD:\".\n           03  COL 19                   PIC X(34) SOURCE sales-record.\n\n       01  TYPE CONTROL HEADING seller-name, LINE + 2.\n           03  COL 1                    VALUE \"Seller:\".\n           03  COL 9                    PIC X(30) SOURCE seller-name.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe above report description describes the following layout:\n<pre>\nSales Report                                                             Page  1\n\nSeller: Howard Bromberg\n  Sales on 10/12/2008 were $1000.00\n  Sales on 12/12/2008 were    $0.00\n  Sales on 13/12/2008 were   $31.47\n  INVALID RECORD: Howard Bromberg             XXXXYY\n\nSeller: Howard Discount\n...\nSales Report                                                            Page 12\n\n  Sales on 08/05/2014 were  $543.98\n  INVALID RECORD: William Selden      12O52014FOOFOO\n  Sales on 30/05/2014 were    $0.00\n</pre>\n\nFour statements control the report writer: {{code|INITIATE}}, which prepares the report writer for printing; {{code|GENERATE}}, which prints a report group; {{code|SUPPRESS}}, which suppresses the printing of a report group; and {{code|TERMINATE}}, which terminates report processing. For the above sales report example, the procedure division might look like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n           OPEN INPUT sales, OUTPUT report-out\n           INITIATE sales-report\n \n           PERFORM UNTIL 1 <> 1\n               READ sales\n                   AT END\n                       EXIT PERFORM\n               END-READ\n \n               VALIDATE sales-record\n               IF valid-record\n                   GENERATE sales-on-day\n               ELSE\n                   GENERATE invalid-sales\n               END-IF\n           END-PERFORM\n \n           TERMINATE sales-report\n           CLOSE sales, report-out\n           .\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nUse of the Report Writer facility tended to vary considerably; some organizations used it extensively and some not at all.{{sfn|McCracken|1976|p=338}}  In addition, implementations of Report Writer ranged in quality, with those at the lower end sometimes using excessive amounts of memory at runtime.{{sfn|McCracken|1976|p=338}}\n\n===Procedure division===\n\n====Procedures====\nThe sections and paragraphs in the procedure division (collectively called procedures) can be used as [[label (programming)|labels]] and as simple [[subroutines]]. Unlike in other divisions, paragraphs do not need to be in sections.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.4}}\nExecution goes down through the procedures of a program until it is terminated.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.6.3}}\nTo use procedures as subroutines, the {{code|PERFORM}} verb is used.\n\nA {{code|PERFORM}} statement somewhat resembles a procedure call in a modern language in the sense that execution returns to the code following the {{code|PERFORM}} statement at the end of the called code; however, it does not provide any mechanism for [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameter passing]] or for returning a result value. If a subroutine is invoked using a simple statement like {{code|PERFORM subroutine|lang=cobolfree}}, then control returns at the end of the called procedure. However, {{code|PERFORM}} is unusual in that it may be used to call a range spanning a sequence of several adjacent procedures. This is done with the {{code|PERFORM sub-1 THRU sub-n|lang=cobolfree}} construct:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nPROCEDURE so-and-so.\n    PERFORM ALPHA\n    PERFORM ALPHA THRU GAMMA\n    STOP RUN.\nALPHA.\n    DISPLAY 'A'.\nBETA.\n    DISPLAY 'B'.\nGAMMA.\n    DISPLAY 'C'.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe output of this program will be: \"A A B C\".\n\n{{code|PERFORM}} also differs from conventional procedure calls in that there is, at least traditionally, no notion of a call stack. As a consequence, nested invocations are possible (a sequence of code being {{code|PERFORM}}'ed may execute a {{code|PERFORM}} statement itself), but require extra care if parts of the same code are executed by both invocations. The problem arises when the code in the inner invocation reaches the exit point of the outer invocation. More formally, if control passes through the exit point of a {{code|PERFORM}} invocation that was called earlier but has not completed yet, the COBOL 2002 standard officially stipulates that the behaviour is [[Undefined behavior|undefined]].\n\nThe reason is that COBOL, rather than a \"return address\", operates with what may be called a continuation address. When control flow reaches the end of any procedure, the continuation address is looked up and control is transferred to that address. Before the program runs, the continuation address for every procedure is initialised to the start address of the procedure that comes next in the program text so that, if no {{code|PERFORM}} statements happen, control flows from top to bottom through the program. But when a {{code|PERFORM}} statement executes, it modifies the continuation address of the called procedure (or the last procedure of the called range, if {{code|PERFORM THRU}} was used), so that control will return to the call site at the end. The original value is saved and is restored afterwards, but there is only one storage position. If two nested invocations operate on overlapping code, they may interfere which each other's management of the continuation address in several ways.<ref name=\"FR99\">{{cite conference | url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ramali/Papers/paste99.pdf | title=Identifying Procedural Structure in Cobol Programs | doi=10.1145/381788.316163 | first1=John | last1=Field | first2=G. | last2=Ramalingam | conference=PASTE '99 | ISBN=1581131372 | conferenceurl=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/paste99.html | date=September 1999}}</ref><ref name=\"VV07\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~nveerman/research/minefield/minefield.pdf | title=Cobol minefield detection | journal=Software\u2014Practice and Experience |date=November 2006 | volume=36 | issue=14 | doi=10.1002/spe.v36:14 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306135410/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~nveerman/research/minefield/minefield.pdf | url-status=dead | archivedate=6 March 2007 | last1=Veerman | first1=Niels | last2=Verhoeven | first2=Ernst-Jan }}</ref>\n\nThe following example (taken from Veerman/Verhoeven, 2006) illustrates the problem:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nLABEL1.\n    DISPLAY '1'\n    PERFORM LABEL2 THRU LABEL3\n    STOP RUN.\nLABEL2.\n    DISPLAY '2'\n    PERFORM LABEL3 THRU LABEL4.\nLABEL3.\n    DISPLAY '3'.\nLABEL4.\n    DISPLAY '4'.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nOne might expect that the output of this program would be \"1 2 3 4 3\": After displaying \"2\", the second {{code|PERFORM}} causes \"3\" and \"4\" to be displayed, and then the first invocation continues on with \"3\". In traditional COBOL implementations, this is not the case. Rather, the first {{code|PERFORM}} statement sets the continuation address at the end of {{code|LABEL3}} so that it will jump back to the call site inside {{code|LABEL1}}. The second {{code|PERFORM}} statement sets the return at the end of {{code|LABEL4}} but does not modify the continuation address of {{code|LABEL3}}, expecting it to be the default continuation. Thus, when the inner invocation arrives at the end of {{code|LABEL3}}, it jumps back to the outer {{code|PERFORM}} statement, and the program stops having printed just \"1 2 3\". On the other hand, in some COBOL implementations like the open-source TinyCOBOL compiler, the two {{code|PERFORM}} statements do not interfere with each other and the output is indeed \"1 2 3 4 3\". Therefore, the behaviour in such cases is not only (perhaps) surprising, it is also not portable.<ref name=\"VV07\"/>\n\nA special consequence of this limitation is that {{code|PERFORM}} cannot be used to write recursive code. Another simple example to illustrate this (slightly simplified from Veerman/Verhoeven, 2006):\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\n    MOVE 1 TO A\n    PERFORM LABEL\n    STOP RUN.\nLABEL.\n    DISPLAY A\n    IF A < 3\n        ADD 1 TO A\n        PERFORM LABEL\n    END-IF\n    DISPLAY 'END'.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nOne might expect that the output is \"1 2 3 END END END\", and in fact that is what some COBOL compilers will produce. But some compilers, like IBM COBOL, will produce code that prints \"1 2 3 END END END END ...\" and so on, printing \"END\" over and over in an endless loop. Since there is limited space to store backup continuation addresses, the backups get overwritten in the course of recursive invocations, and all that can be restored is the jump back to {{code|DISPLAY 'END'}}.<ref name=\"VV07\"/>\n\n====Statements====\nCOBOL 2014 has 47 statements (also called ''{{dfn|verbs}}''),{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9}} which can be grouped into the following broad categories: control flow, I/O, data manipulation and the report writer. The report writer statements are covered in the [[#Report writer|report writer section]].\n\n=====Control flow=====\nCOBOL's [[conditional (computer programming)|conditional statements]] are {{code|IF}} and {{code|EVALUATE}}. {{code|EVALUATE}} is a [[switch statement|switch-like statement]] with the added capability of evaluating multiple values and conditions. This can be used to implement [[decision table]]s. For example, the following might be used to control a [[CNC lathe]]: <!-- a more common appliance would be more suitable. -->\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nEVALUATE TRUE ALSO desired-speed ALSO current-speed\n    WHEN lid-closed ALSO min-speed THRU max-speed ALSO LESS THAN desired-speed\n        PERFORM speed-up-machine\n    WHEN lid-closed ALSO min-speed THRU max-speed ALSO GREATER THAN desired-speed\n        PERFORM slow-down-machine\n    WHEN lid-open ALSO ANY ALSO NOT ZERO\n        PERFORM emergency-stop\n    WHEN OTHER\n        CONTINUE\nEND-EVALUATE\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe {{code|PERFORM}} statement is used to define loops which are executed {{em|until}} a condition is true (not {{em|while}} true, which is more common in other languages). It is also used to call procedures or ranges of procedures (see the [[#Procedures|procedures section]] for more details). {{code|CALL}} and {{code|INVOKE}} call subprograms and methods, respectively. The name of the subprogram/method is contained in a string which may be a literal or a data item.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7\u00a7 14.9.4, 14.9.22}} Parameters can be passed [[call by reference|by reference]], by content (where a copy is passed by reference) or [[call by value|by value]] (but only if a [[function prototype|prototype]] is available).{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.6.5.2.2}}\n{{code|CANCEL}} unloads subprograms from memory. {{code|GO TO}} causes the program to jump to a specified procedure.\n\nThe {{code|GOBACK}} statement is a [[return statement]] and the {{code|STOP}} statement stops the program. The {{code|EXIT}} statement has six different formats: it can be used as a return statement, a [[break statement]], a [[continue statement]], an end marker or to leave a procedure.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9.13.1}}\n\n[[Exception handling|Exceptions]] are raised by a {{code|RAISE}} statement and caught with a handler, or ''{{dfn|declarative}}'', defined in the {{code|DECLARATIVES}} portion of the procedure division. Declaratives are sections beginning with a {{code|USE}} statement which specify the errors to handle. Exceptions can be names or objects. {{code|RESUME}} is used in a declarative to jump to the statement after the one that raised the exception or to a procedure outside the {{code|DECLARATIVES}}. Unlike other languages, uncaught exceptions may not terminate the program and the program can proceed unaffected.\n\n=====I/O=====\nFile I/O is handled by the self-describing {{code|OPEN}}, {{code|CLOSE}}, {{code|READ}}, and {{code|WRITE}} statements along with a further three: {{code|REWRITE}}, which updates a record; {{code|START}}, which selects subsequent records to access by finding a record with a certain key; and {{code|UNLOCK}}, which releases a [[lock (database)|lock]] on the last record accessed.\n\nUser interaction is done using {{code|ACCEPT}} and {{code|DISPLAY}}.\n\n=====Data manipulation=====\nThe following verbs manipulate data:\n* {{code|INITIALIZE}}, which sets data items to their default values.\n* {{code|MOVE}}, which [[assignment (computer science)|assigns]] values to data items ; ''MOVE CORRESPONDING'' assigns corresponding like-named [[Record (computer science)#COBOL|fields]].\n* {{code|SET}}, which has 15 formats: it can modify indices, assign object references and alter table capacities, among other functions.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a714.9.35.1}}\n* {{code|ADD}}, {{code|SUBTRACT}}, {{code|MULTIPLY}}, {{code|DIVIDE}}, and {{code|COMPUTE}}, which handle arithmetic (with {{code|COMPUTE}} assigning the result of a formula to a variable).\n* {{code|ALLOCATE}} and {{code|FREE}}, which handle [[dynamic memory]].\n* {{code|VALIDATE}}, which validates and distributes data as specified in an item's description in the data division.\n* {{code|STRING}} and {{code|UNSTRING}}, which [[Concatenation|concatenate]] and split [[string (computer science)|string]]s, respectively.\n* {{code|INSPECT}}, which tallies or replaces instances of specified [[substring]]s within a string.\n* {{code|SEARCH}}, which searches a table for the first entry satisfying a condition.\n\nFiles and tables are sorted using {{code|SORT}} and the {{code|MERGE}} verb merges and sorts files. The {{code|RELEASE}} verb provides records to sort and {{code|RETURN}} retrieves sorted records in order.\n\n====Scope termination====\nSome statements, such as {{code|IF}} and {{code|READ}}, may themselves contain statements. Such statements may be terminated in two ways: by a period (''{{dfn|implicit termination}}''), which terminates ''all'' unterminated statements contained, or by a scope terminator, which terminates the nearest matching open statement.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\n*> Terminator period (\"implicit termination\")\nIF invalid-record\n    IF no-more-records\n        NEXT SENTENCE\n    ELSE\n        READ record-file\n            AT END SET no-more-records TO TRUE.\n\n*> Scope terminators (\"explicit termination\")\nIF invalid-record\n    IF no-more-records\n        CONTINUE\n    ELSE\n        READ record-file\n            AT END SET no-more-records TO TRUE\n        END-READ\n    END-IF\nEND-IF\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nNested statements terminated with a period are a common source of bugs.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=899}}{{sfn|McCracken|Golden|1988|loc=\u00a7 8.4}} For example, examine the following code:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nIF x\n    DISPLAY y.\n    DISPLAY z.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nHere, the intent is to display <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> if condition <code>x</code> is true.

[[Edsger Dijkstra]], a preeminent computer scientist, wrote a [[letter to the editor]] of [[Communications of the ACM]], published 1975 entitled \"How do we tell truths that might hurt?\", in which he was critical of COBOL and several other contemporary languages; remarking that \"the use of COBOL cripples the mind\".<ref name=\"Dijkstra1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD498.html|title=How do we tell truths that might hurt?|accessdate=29 August 2007|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|date=18 June 1975|author=Dijkstra, Edsger W.|id=EWD498|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502143353/http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD498.html|archive-date=2 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nIn a published dissent to Dijkstra's remarks, the computer scientist Howard E. Tompkins claimed that [[unstructured programming|unstructured]] COBOL tended to be \"written by programmers that have never had the benefit of structured COBOL taught well\", arguing that the issue was primarily one of training.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1145/948176.948186| title = In defense of teaching structured COBOL as computer science| journal = ACM SIGPLAN Notices| volume = 18| issue = 4| pages = 86\u201394| year = 1983| last1 = Tompkins | first1 = H. E. }}</ref>\n\nOne cause of [[spaghetti code]] was the {{code|GO TO}} statement. Attempts to remove {{code|GO TO}}s from COBOL code, however, resulted in convoluted programs and reduced code quality.{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=125}} {{code|GO TO}}s were largely replaced by the {{code|PERFORM}} statement and procedures, which promoted [[modular programming]]{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=125}} and gave easy access to powerful looping facilities. However, {{code|PERFORM}} could only be used with procedures so loop bodies were not located where they were used, making programs harder to understand.{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|pp=349\u2013350}}\n\nCOBOL programs were infamous for being monolithic and lacking modularization.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJmJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4 | title=Beginning COBOL for Programmers | publisher=Apress | accessdate=13 August 2014 | page=4 | first=Michael | last=Coughlan | isbn=978-1430262534 | date=16 March 2014}}</ref>\nCOBOL code could only be modularized through procedures, which were found to be inadequate for large systems. It was impossible to restrict access to data, meaning a procedure could access and modify {{em|any}} data item. Furthermore, there was no way to pass [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]s to a procedure, an omission Jean Sammet regarded as the committee's biggest mistake.{{sfn|Sammet|1978b|p=258}}\nAnother complication stemmed from the ability to {{code|PERFORM THRU}} a specified sequence of procedures. This meant that control could jump to and return from any procedure, creating convoluted control flow and permitting a programmer to break the [[single-entry single-exit]] rule.{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=126}}\n\nThis situation improved as COBOL adopted more features. COBOL-74 added subprograms, giving programmers the ability to control the data each part of the program could access. COBOL-85 then added nested subprograms, allowing programmers to hide subprograms.{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=127}} Further control over data and code came in 2002 when object-oriented programming, user-defined functions and user-defined data types were included.\n\nNevertheless, much important legacy COBOL software uses unstructured code, which has become unmaintainable. It can be too risky and costly to modify even a simple section of code, since it may be used from unknown places in unknown ways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2016/07/cobol-and-legacy-code-as-a-systemic-risk.html?imm_mid=0e6043&cmp=em-prog-na-na-newsltr_20160723|title=COBOL and Legacy Code as a Systemic Risk {{!}} naked capitalism|date=19 July 2016|language=en-US|access-date=23 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Compatibility issues===\nCOBOL was intended to be a highly portable, \"common\" language.

Yet by 1984, maintainers of COBOL programs were struggling to deal with \"incomprehensible\" code{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/10}} and the main changes in COBOL-85 were there to help ease maintenance.<ref name=\"Computerworld Garfunkel\" />\n\nJean Sammet, a short-range committee member, noted that \"little attempt was made to cater to the professional programmer, in fact people whose main interest is programming tend to be very unhappy with COBOL\" which she attributed to COBOL's verbose syntax.{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/14}}\n\n===Isolation from the computer science community===\nThe COBOL community has always been isolated from the computer science community. No academic computer scientists participated in the design of COBOL: all of those on the committee came from commerce or government. Computer scientists at the time were more interested in fields like numerical analysis, physics and system programming than the commercial file-processing problems which COBOL development tackled.{{sfn|Sammet|1961|p=380}} Jean Sammet attributed COBOL's unpopularity to an initial \"snob reaction\" due to its inelegance, the lack of influential computer scientists participating in the design process and a disdain for business data processing.{{sfn|Marcotty|1978|p=266}} The COBOL specification used a unique \"notation\", or [[metalanguage]], to define its syntax rather than the new [[Backus\u2013Naur form]] which the committee did not know of.

The first sheet consists of advertisements, two of these being about things lost, and one about the sale of some property, all relating to Parsis.

Then there are four columns of short paragraphs about Government and Court appointments and changes, and powers of attorney taken from the court; about the arrival and departure of ships and of Europeans from Mumbai; and a list of European deaths; as well as of ships loading in the harbour. Six columns are given to [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata) news taken from the [[The Gazette of India|Indian Gazette]] and the Calcutta Chronicle; one column to [[Madras]] (now Chennai) news from the Government Gazette of that city; two columns to London news, whilst a short paragraph of ten lines is devoted to news from Canton in China, given the prices of opium.

The founder, a Parsi scholar and priest by the name of Fardoonji Murazban, was a pioneer not only of journalism in [[Western India]] but of all Gujarati printed literature. He founded the first native press in 1812 and in 1814 brought out a [[Gujarati Calendar]], fully 6 years before the first Bengali calendar was printed and published in Calcutta. He then went on to bring out his Newspaper, the Bombay Samachar, in 1822.\n\nHe must have started all his concerns in auspicious moments, for all, his press, his calendar and his paper exist to the present day in very good and flourishing condition. Respected by both the British and Indian Government for its fair, frank, objective and critical analysis of events, the Mumbai Samachar played a very important role during India's struggle for independence being often quoted by freedom fighters like [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] and others.\nFrom its inception the editorial policy was to objectively report events in a fair and honest manner and not to sensationalize news, sobriety and independence of views being a characteristic which still stands. Another notable feature of this paper which holds good to this day is the policy to allow numerous small advertisers to advertise their products on the front page rather than allow only one advertiser to occupy what is commonly referred to as solus position.\n\nThe paper passed through various hands before coming into the hands of the Cama Family, its present publishers in 1933, and Hormusji N Cama, the present director of the publication.<ref>{{cite news|title= Leisure: Vintage journey|url= http://www.punemirror.in/article/56/2013032220130322092544627e5cf905/Talk-of-the-town.html|archive-url= https://archive.is/20130412231025/http://www.punemirror.in/article/56/2013032220130322092544627e5cf905/Talk-of-the-town.html|url-status= dead|archive-date= 12 April 2013|newspaper=[[Mumbai Mirror|Pune Mirror]]|date= 22 March 2013|accessdate= 22 March 2013}}</ref> It has since grown and expanded and today can proudly lay claim to having the most modern technology available in the publishing field.

Respected by both the British and Indian Government for its fair, frank, objective and critical analysis of events, the Mumbai Samachar played a very important role during India's struggle for independence being often quoted by freedom fighters like [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] and others.\nFrom its inception the editorial policy was to objectively report events in a fair and honest manner and not to sensationalize news, sobriety and independence of views being a characteristic which still stands. Another notable feature of this paper which holds good to this day is the policy to allow numerous small advertisers to advertise their products on the front page rather than allow only one advertiser to occupy what is commonly referred to as solus position.\n\nThe paper passed through various hands before coming into the hands of the Cama Family, its present publishers in 1933, and Hormusji N Cama, the present director of the publication.<ref>{{cite news|title= Leisure: Vintage journey|url= http://www.punemirror.in/article/56/2013032220130322092544627e5cf905/Talk-of-the-town.html|archive-url= https://archive.is/20130412231025/http://www.punemirror.in/article/56/2013032220130322092544627e5cf905/Talk-of-the-town.html|url-status= dead|archive-date= 12 April 2013|newspaper=[[Mumbai Mirror|Pune Mirror]]|date= 22 March 2013|accessdate= 22 March 2013}}</ref> It has since grown and expanded and today can proudly lay claim to having the most modern technology available in the publishing field.

The preparatory pastel and the print of the ''\"Vue de Quimperl\u00e9'' \"(1917) are good examples of his technique of first creating a pastel drawing from nature and then creating an engraving in the workshop.

In 1912 he started making [[woodcut]]s, on the advice of St\u00e9phane Pannemaker, but it was only later that he adopted the technique of making woodcuts with the knife to illustrate the 1920 book ''La Rapsode foraine et le Pardon de Sainte-Ann''e<ref name=\":0\" /> after the poem by [[Tristan Corbi\u00e8re]].\n\nA second part of his work deals with feminine grace, mutiny and the naivety of children.

{"title_page": "Heliciculture", "text_new": "[[File:Eyragues-l-Escargot-des-Alpilles-5738.jpg|thumb|A snail farm near [[Eyragues]], [[Provence]], [[France]]]]\n'''Heliciculture''', commonly known as '''snail farming''', is the process of raising edible [[land snail]]s, primarily for human consumption or cosmetic use. The meat and  [[Snail caviar|snail eggs]] can be consumed as [[escargot]] and as a type of caviar respectively. Mucus, commonly known as [[snail slime]], has medical properties and is used in [[cosmetics]].\n\nPerhaps the best known edible land snail species in the [[Western world]] is the [[Helix pomatia]], commonly known as [[Roman snail]] or [[Burgundy snail]]. This species is however not fit for profitable snail farming, and normally harvested from nature.\n\nCommercial snail farming in the Western world is typically done with either the ''[[Cornu aspersum]],'' formerly known as Helix ''aspersa'' M\u00fcller'','' or the [[Helix aspersa Maxima|Helix ''aspersa'' Maxima]]. In tropical climates snail farming is typically done with the ''[[African snail]],'' which biologically does not fall in the family of [[Helicidae]], and the meat of which therefore may not be called escargot.\n\n== History ==\nRoasted snail shells have been found in [[archaeological]] excavations, an indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times.<ref>[http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~dlubell/Antibes.pdf Prehistoric edible land snails in the circum-Mediterranean: the archaeological evidence.], D.

Budja (ed.), ''Neolithic Studies 11. Documenta Praehistorica XXXI'': 1-24. D. Lubell.</ref>\n\n''Lumaca romana'', (translation: Roman snail), was an ancient method of snail farming or heliciculture in the region about [[Tarquinia]]. This snail farming method was described by [[:la:Quintus Fulvius Lippinus|Fulvius Lippinus]] (49 BC) and mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ''De Re rustica'' III, 12.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/3*.html#12 De Re Rustica III, 12]</ref> The snails were fattened for human consumption using [[spelt]] and aromatic herbs. People usually raised snails in pens near the house, and these pens were called \"[[:la:Cochlea (animal)|cochlea]].\"\n\nThe Romans, in particular, are known to have considered escargot as an elite food, as noted in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. The Romans selected the best snails for breeding. Shells of the edible land snail species ''[[Otala lactea]]'' have been recovered in [[archaeological]] excavations of [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906]</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described the snail garden of [[Fulvius Hirpinus]] 2,000 years ago as having separate sections for different species of snails. [[Hirpinus]] allegedly fed his snails on meal and wine.\n\n\"Wall fish\" were also often eaten in Britain, but were never as popular as on the continent. There, people often ate snails during [[Lent]], and in a few places, they consumed large quantities of snails at Mardi Gras or Carnival, as a foretaste of Lent.\n\nAccording to some sources, the French exported [[Helix aspersa|brown garden snails]] to California in the 1850s, raising them as the delicacy [[escargot]]. Other sources claim that Italian immigrants were the first to bring the snail to the United States.\n\n== Economic impact ==\nU.S. imports of snails were worth more than $4.5 million in 1995 and came from 24 countries. This includes preserved or prepared snails and snails that are live, fresh, chilled, or frozen. Major exporters to the U.S. are [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Greece]] and [[China]]. The U.S. exported live, fresh, chilled, or frozen snails worth $55,000 to 13 countries; most were shipped to [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Individual statistics are not available for U.S. exports of prepared or processed snails from the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]].\n\n== List of edible land snail species ==\n[[File:Snails-Italy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Three different species of snails for sale in a market in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]\nEdible land snails range in size from about one millimeter long to the giant African snails, which occasionally grow up to {{convert|312|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in length. \"Escargot\" most commonly refers to either ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' or to ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', although other varieties of snails are eaten. ''[[Achatina fulica]]'', a giant African snail, is sliced and [[Canning|canned]] and passed off on some consumers as escargot. Terms such as \"garden snail\" or \"common brown garden snail\" are rather meaningless since they refer to so many types of snails, but they sometimes mean ''H. aspersa''.\n* ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' is also known as the French \"petit gris,\" \"small grey snail,\" the \"escargot chagrine,\" or \"la zigrinata.\" The shell of a mature adult has four to five whorls and measures 30 to 45&nbsp;mm across. It is native to the shores of the Mediterranean and up the coast of Spain and France. It is found on many British Isles, where the Romans introduced it in the 1st century AD (Some references say it dates to the Early Bronze Age.) In the early 19th century the French brought it into California, where it has become a serious pest. These snails are now common throughout the U.S. It was introduced into several Eastern and Gulf states even before 1850 and, later introduced into other countries such as Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, and Argentina. ''C. aspersum'' has a life span of 2 to 5 years. This species is more adaptable to different climates and conditions than many snails, and is found in woods, fields, sand dunes, and gardens. This adaptability not only increases ''C. aspersum's'' range, but it also makes farming ''C. aspersum'' easier and less risky.\n* ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It also is called the \"Roman snail,\" \"apple snail,\" \"lunar,\" \"la vignaiola,\" the German \"Weinbergschnecke,\" the French \"escargot de Bourgogne\" or \"Burgundy snail,\" or \"gros blanc.\" Native over a large part of Europe, it lives in wooded mountains and valleys up to {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} altitude and in vineyards and gardens. The Romans may have introduced it into Britain. Immigrants introduced it into the U.S. in Michigan and Wisconsin. Many prefer ''H. pomatia'' to ''H. aspersa'' for its flavor and its larger size, as the \"escargot par excellence.\"\n* ''[[Otala lactea]]'' is sometimes called the \"vineyard snail,\" \"milk snail,\" or \"Spanish snail.\" The shell is white with reddish brown spiral bands and measures about 26 to 35&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n* ''[[Iberus alonensis]]'', the Spanish \"vaqueta\" or \"serrana,\" measures about 30&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n[[File:Cepaea nemoralis pair banded shells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'']]\n* ''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'', the \"grove snail,\" or the Spanish \"vaqueta,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm across the shell. It inhabits Central Europe and was introduced into, and is now naturalized in many U.S. states, from Massachusetts to California, and from Tennessee to Canada. Its habitat ranges widely from woods to dunes. It mainly eats dead plant material, but it likes nettles and buttercups and will eat dead worms and dead snails.\n* ''[[Cepaea hortensis]]'', the \"white-lipped snail,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm across the shell which often has distinct dark stripes. It is native to central and northern Europe. This species was introduced into Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in colonial times, but it never became established in these states. Its habitat varies but ''C. hortensis'' is found in colder and wetter places than ''C. nemoralis''. Their smaller size and some people's opinion that they do not taste as good make ''C. hortensis'' and ''C. nemoralis'' less popular than the larger European land snails.\n* ''[[Otala punctata]]'', called \"vaqueta\" in some parts of Spain, measures about 35&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n* ''[[Eobania vermiculata]]'', the \"vinyala,\" \"mongeta,\" or \"xona,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm. It is found in Mediterranean countries and was introduced into Louisiana and Texas.\n* ''[[Helix lucorum]]'', sometimes called \"escargo turc,\" measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It is found in central Italy and from Yugoslavia through the Crimea to Turkey and around the Black Sea.\n* ''[[Helix adanensis]]'' comes from around Turkey.\n* ''[[Helix aperta]]'' measures about 25&nbsp;mm. Its meat is highly prized. It is native to France, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries and has become established in California and Louisiana. Sometimes known as the \"burrowing snail,\" it is found above ground only during rainy weather. In hot, dry weather, it burrows three to six inches into the ground and becomes dormant until rain soften the soil.\n* ''[[Theba pisana]]'', also called the \"banded snail\"or the \"cargol avellanenc,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm and lives on dry, exposed sites, usually near the sea. Native to Sicily, it has been spread to several European countries, including England. This snail is a serious garden pest and is the \"white snail\" that California once eradicated by using flamethrowers to burn off whole areas. In large numbers, up to 3,000 snails per tree, it can ravage a garden in 24 hours and a citrus or other crop in a couple of nights.\n* ''[[Sphincterochila candidissima]]'' or ''[[Leucochroa candidisima]]'', the \"cargol mongeta,\" or \"cargol jueu\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm.\n[[File:Achatina fulica Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Achatina fulica]]'']]\n* ''[[Achatina fulica]]'' and other ''Achatina'' species, giant African snails. They can grow up to 326&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;ft \u00be in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate ''Achatina''. The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/29/illegal-giant-snails-threatening-america/|title=Illegal giant snails threatening America|date=2014-08-29|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant \"tiger stripes\" on their shells.\n\n== Mating and egg laying ==\n\n=== General ===\nSnails are [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although they have both male and female [[reproductive organ]]s, they must mate with another snail of the same species before they lay eggs. Some snails may act as males one season and as females the next. Other snails play both roles at once and [[fertilize]] each other simultaneously. When the snail is large enough and mature enough, which may take several years, mating occurs in the late spring or early summer after several hours of [[courtship]]. Sometimes there is a second mating in summer. (In tropical climates, mating may occur several times a year. In some climates, snails mate around October and may mate a second time 2 weeks later.) After mating, the snail can store sperm received for up to a year, but it usually lays eggs within a few weeks. Snails are sometimes uninterested in mating with another snail of the same species that originated from a considerable distance away. For example, a ''H. aspersa'' from southern France may reject a ''H. aspersa'' from northern France.\n\n=== ''Helix pomatia'' ===\nSnails need soil at least 2&nbsp;inches deep in which to lay their eggs. For ''H. pomatia'', the soil should be at least 3&nbsp;inches deep to keep out pests such as [[ants]], [[earwig]]s, [[millipede]]s, etc. Dry soil is not suitable for the preparation of a nest, nor is soil that is too heavy. In clay soil that becomes hard, reproduction rates may decrease because the snails are unable to bury their eggs and the hatchlings have difficulty emerging from the nest. Hatchability of eggs depends on soil temperature, soil humidity, soil composition, etc. Soil consisting of 20% to 40% organic material is good. The soil should be kept at {{convert|41|to|50|F|C}}, and is best around {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Soil moisture should be maintained at 80%. One researcher removes eggs immediately after they are deposited, counts them, then keeps them on moist cotton until the eggs hatch and the young start to eat. Snails lose substantial weight by laying eggs. Some do not recover. About one-third of the snails will die after the breeding season.\n\n''H. pomatia'' eggs measure about 3&nbsp;mm in diameter and have a [[calcareous]] shell and a high [[yolk]] content. ''H. pomatia'' lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only the top of the shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is [[glycoprotein]] similar to eggwhite.\n\nFully developed baby ''H. pomatia'' snails hatch about 3 to 4 weeks after the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes as deep as {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}, and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This is a response to both decreasing temperature and shorter hours of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.\n\n=== ''Helix aspersa'' ===\n''H. aspersa'' eggs are white, spherical, about {{cvt|3|mm|in|frac=8}} in diameter and are laid 5 days to 3 weeks after mating. (Data varies widely due to differences in climate and regional variations in the snails' habitats.) ''H. aspersa'' lays an average of 85 eggs in a nest that is {{convert|1|to|1+1/2|in|cm}} deep. Data varies from 30 to over 120 eggs, but high figures may be from when more than one snail lays eggs in the same nest.\n\nIn warm, damp climates, ''H. aspersa'' may lay eggs as often as five times from February through October, depending on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when there are at least 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days to break out of the sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, ''H. aspersa'' matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, ''H. aspersa'' hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early [[hatchlings]], the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some ''H. aspersa'' mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of ''H. aspersa's'' reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.\n\n=== ''Achatina fulica'' ===\nBy contrast, one giant African snail, ''Achatina fulica'', lays 100 to 400 [[elliptical]] eggs that each measure about 5&nbsp;mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, usually in the wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like ''H. pomatia'', or lay eggs on the surface of a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4&nbsp;mm long. These snails grow up to 10&nbsp;mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35&nbsp;mm long and may already be sexually mature. [[Sexual maturity]] takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of [[calcium]]. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.\n\n== Growth ==\nWithin the same snail population and under the same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild. However, a snail farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in only a couple of generations. Most of the differences in growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.\n\nSeveral factors can greatly influence the growth of snails including: population density, stress (snails are sensitive to noise, light, vibration, unsanitary conditions, irregular feedings, being touched, etc.), feed, temperature and moisture, and the breeding technology used.\n\n''H. aspersa'' requires at least 3% to 4% calcium in the soil (or another source of calcium) for good growth. Most snails need more calcium in the soil than ''H. aspersa''. Low calcium intake will slow the growth rate and cause the shell to be thinner. Calcium may be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. Food is only one calcium source. Snails may eat paint or attack walls of buildings seeking calcium, and they also will eat dirt.\n\nA newborn's shell size depends on the egg size since the shell develops from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; there will be no further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.\n\nDryness inhibits growth and even stops activity. When it becomes too hot and dry in summer, the snail becomes inactive, seals its shell and [[estivation|estivates]] (becomes dormant) until cooler, moister weather returns. Some snails estivate in groups on tree trunks, posts, or walls. They seal themselves to the surface, thus sealing up the shell opening.\n\nPeak snail activity (including feeding and thus growth) occurs a few hours after sunset, when the temperature is lower and the water content (in the form of [[dew]]) is higher. During daytime snails usually seek shelter.\n\n== Farming snails ==\nSuccessful snail culture requires the correct equipment and supplies, including: [[snail pens]] or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity ([[hygrometer]]), temperature ([[thermometer]]), soil moisture ([[soil moisture sensor]]), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and an instrument to measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate ([[temperature]] and [[humidity]]), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails of the same kind and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.\n\nFour systems of snail farms can be distinguished:\n* Outdoor pens.\n* In buildings with a controlled climate.\n* In closed systems such as plastic tunnel houses or \"[[greenhouse]]s.\"\n* In addition, snails may breed and hatch inside in a controlled environment and then (after 6 to 8 weeks) may be placed in outside pens to mature.\n\n=== Favorable conditions ===\n\n'''Climate''': A mild climate {{convert|15|-|25|C|F}} with high humidity (75% to 95%) is best for snail farming, though most varieties can stand a wider range of temperatures. The optimal temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for many varieties. When the temperature falls below {{convert|7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, snails hibernate. Under {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} the snails are inactive, and under {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, all growth stops. When the temperature rises much above {{convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} or conditions become too dry, snails estivate. Wind is bad for snails because it speeds up moisture loss, and snails must retain moisture.\n\n'''Moisture''': Snails thrive in damp but not waterlogged environments and thus a well-draining soil is required. Research indicates that water content around 80% of the carrying capacity of the soil and air [[humidity]] over 80% (during darkness) are the most favorable conditions. Many farmers use [[Aerosol spray|mist-producing devices]] to maintain proper moisture in the air and/or soil.<ref>http://publications.cta.int/publications/publication/1497/</ref> Also, if the system contains alive vegetation, the leaves are to be periodically wet.\n\n'''[[Soil]]''': Snails dig in soil and ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and provides some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will eat only one or the other.\n\nA well-functional soil would have the following characteristics:\n* Containing neither a lot of [[sand]] nor too much [[clay]], as snails strive to dig into hard clay and sand dries out easily.\n* 20\u201340% organic matter content. Organic matter enhances [[cation exchange capacity]] of calcium and [[magnesium]] which in turn stimulates growth.\n* [[pH]] around 7.\n* Adequate [[calcium]], the primary constituent of shells (up to 98%). A common way to introduce calcium is to add ground [[limestone]] at a suggested concentration of {{convert|0.5|kg/m2|lb/sqft}}. Calcium may also be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. More advanced techniques involve the addition of [[polyacrylamide]] with the following concentration: 12.5&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of a 160&nbsp;g M.A./one preparation in 250 cc of water per kilogram of dry soil. Such stabilization treatment helps the soil structure resist washing and allows regular cleaning without destroying the crumb structure of the soil that is beneficial for egg laying.\n\nSoil care: A farmer must find a way to prevent the soil from becoming fouled with mucus and droppings and also tackle undesirable [[Soil chemistry|chemical changes]] that may occur in time.\n\nSoil mix suggestions:\n* [[peat]], clay, [[compost]] and [[calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]]\n* [[Leaf mold]] (at pH 7)\n\n== Pens and enclosures ==\n\nThe U.S. [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] ([[APHIS]]) Standards for [[Snail-Rearing Facilities]] were revised March 2001 and are available on the APHIS website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415075557/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |archive-date=2006-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEnclosures for snails are usually long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers to walk around (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The enclosure may be a trough with sides made of [[wood]], [[Concrete masonry unit|block]], [[fiber cement sheets]], or [[galvanized]] [[sheet steel]]. Cover it with [[Sieve|screen]] or [[netting]]. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} high plus at least {{convert|5|in|cm}} into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine mesh screen) on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5&nbsp;mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences. Pens containing baby snails need a finer mesh.\n\nSnails need hiding places, especially during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local [[garden center]] can be split in two lengthwise, and stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.\n\nA sprinkler system ensures moisture when needed and can be turned on at sunset rather than earlier in the day, when the moisture may drive snails out into hot sunshine. Temperature and humidity can be monitored using a thermometer and a hygrometer.\n\nThe bottom of the enclosure, if it is not the ground or trays of dirt, needs be a surface more solid than screening. A snail placed in a wire-mesh-bottom pen will keep crawling, trying to get off the wires and onto solid, more comfortable ground.\n\nIn order to prevent escapes, in an open pen, the top of the fences curve inward in a half circle; this works to confine the vineyard snail. However, ''H. aspersa'' can escape from such an open pen, and an electric fence may be needed to contain them. [The [[electric fence]] top has two or more thin wires that are 2 to 4&nbsp;mm apart. Each wire carries the opposite charge of the wire next to it. A battery or transformer is used to supply 4 to 12 [[volt]]s to the wire. A snail will get a mild shock and retract when it crawls over a wire and touches a second wire.]\n\nAnother technique to confine snails is to bend the fence top inward into a sharp \"V\" shape with about a 20-degree angle. The snail's shell will hit the bent-back part of the screen before the snail can reach up and start crawling on it. This blocks the snail, and the angled screen automatically compensates for the size of the snail.\n\nAnother alternative, suitable for solid wall enclosures, is to attach to the wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls on the underside of the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.\n\nBecause snails usually will not cross a [[copper]] band, another solution is to top the fence with a copper band at least {{convert|3|in|cm|round=5}} wide. The band can be bent so that part of it faces inward and is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.\n\nAn alternate method is to make a square pen with a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}}-square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., [[Urtica|nettles]] and [[artichoke]]s, inside the pen. The snails will choose what they want to eat. If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless the snails are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if the snails are not mature at the end of the year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.\n\nPlastic tunnels make cheap, easy snail enclosures, but it is difficult to regulate heat and humidity. The tunnel will be {{convert|10|to|20|F-change|C-change|0}} warmer than the outside, and snails become dormant when the temperature climbs above {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhen snails are raised indoors under controlled conditions, reproduction varies according to the geographic origin of the [[breeding stock]]. For example, one researcher found that ''H. aspersa'' snails from [[Brittany]] seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at {{convert|70|F|C}} and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The [[Center for Heliciculture]] once recommended 65\u201375% humidity during the day and 85\u201395% at night at {{convert|68|F|C}}. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For ''H. aspersa'', the optimum temperature for hatching eggs seems to be {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at {{convert|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.\n\n[[Fluorescent lamp]]s can be used to give artificial daylight. Different snails respond to day length in different ways. The ratio of light to darkness influences activity, feeding, and mating and egg-laying. Eighteen or more hours of light apparently stimulate ''H. aspersa'' growth, while less than 12 hours inhibit it. Some snail species may associates the long hours of light with the start of summer\u2014the peak growing season. Eighteen hours of daylight also appear optimal for breeding (mating and egg laying), but snails will breed in darkness.\n\nSnails can be bred in boxes or cages stacked several units high. An automatic sprinkler system can be used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about {{convert|3|in|cm}} deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.)\n\nWhen the snails have laid their eggs, the pots are put in a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails are kept in the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a separate pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.\n\nBaby snails are fed on tender [[lettuce]] leaves ([[Boston lettuce|Boston]] type, but [[head lettuce|head]] type is probably also good.)\n\nSome who raise ''H. aspersa'' separate the five stages: reproduction, hatching, young, fattening, and final fattening.\n\nIn a typical example, the [[Reproduction|breeding]] box has [[concrete]] sides, soil with [[earthworm]]s (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a chicken waterer. [[Mosquito]] netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better results may be obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouse\u2014as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those he had that year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.\n\n[[Fattening pens]] can be outside or in a greenhouse. High summer temperatures and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails. This is more a problem inside greenhouses if the sun overheats the building. A sprinkler system (e.g., a [[horticultural]] system or common lawn sprinklers) can supply moisture. Make sure excess water can drain.\n\nFattening pens may contain {{convert|2|by|3|ft|m|adj=on}} pieces (or other convenient size) of heavy plastic sheets, hung from boards resting on a rack that lets the tips of the plastic sheets just touch the ground. The plastic sheets are about {{convert|4|in|cm}} apart. The sheets give the snails a resting and hiding place. Feeders may be located on the rack that supports the plastic sheets.\n\nA layer of coarse sand and [[topsoil]] with earthworms is placed on the fattening pen's bottom. The worms help clean up the snail droppings.\n\nSnails that hatched the previous summer can be put in a chilled room for hibernation over winter. About 1 April, (adjusted for local climate), they are moved to the final fattening pen. IN cases where there are several fattening pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of ''H. aspersa'' snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For ''H. aspersa'', 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.\n\n== Cannibalism by hatchlings ==\nThe first snails to hatch eat the shells of their eggs. This gives them calcium needed for their shells. They may then begin eating unhatched eggs. If the snail eggs are kept at the optimum temperature, {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} (for some varieties), and if none of the eggs lose moisture, most eggs will hatch within 1 to 3 days of each other. [[Cannibalism]] also will be low. If hatching extends over a longer period, cannibalism may increase. Some eggs eaten are eggs that were not fertile or did not develop properly, but sometimes, properly developing embryos might be eaten. A high density of \"clutches\" of egg masses increases the rate of cannibalism, as other nearby egg masses are more likely to be found and eaten. Snail egg has 12 to 20 times the protein of lettuce. The protein helps the baby snails start developing quickly and be healthier. Snail egg is an excellent starter food for newly hatched snails, but they tend to only eat eggs of their own species.\n\n== Feeding ==\nFeeding season is April through October, (or may vary with the local climate), with a \"rest period\" during the summer. Do not place food in one small clump so that there is not enough room for all the snails to get to it. Snails eat solid food by [[rasping]] it away with their [[radula]]. Feeding activity depends on the weather, and snails may not necessarily feed every day. Evening irrigation in dry weather may encourage feeding since the moisture makes it easier for the snails to move about.\n\nPut the breeding snails in the breeding pens in April or early May. Feed until mid June when mating begins and the snails stop feeding. Snails resume eating after they lay eggs. Once snails have laid their eggs, the adult snails can be removed. This leaves more food and less crowding for the hatchlings.\n\nSnails of the same species collected from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: [[Alyssum]], fruit and leaves of [[apple]], [[apricot]], [[artichoke]] (a favorite), [[Aster (genus)|aster]], [[barley]], [[beans]], [[bindweed]], [[California boxwood]], almost any [[cabbage]] variety, [[camomile]], [[carnation]], [[carrot]], [[cauliflower]], [[celeriac]] (root celery), [[celery]], ripe [[cherries]], [[chive]], citrus, [[clover]], [[cucumber]]s (a favorite snail food), [[dandelion]], [[Elderberry|elder]], [[henbane]], [[hibiscus]], [[hollyhock]], [[kale]], larkspur ([[Consolida]] or [[Delphinium]] genera), [[leek]], lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), [[lily]], [[magnolia]], [[mountain ash]], [[mulberry]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]], [[Urtica|nettle]], [[nightshade]] berries, [[oats]], [[onion]] greens, [[pansy]], [[parsley]], [[peach]], ripe [[pear]]s, [[pea]]s, [[petunia]], [[phlox]], [[plum]], [[potato]]es (raw or cooked), [[pumpkin]]s, [[radish]], [[rapeseed|rape]], [[rose]], [[sorrel]], [[spinach]], [[sweet pea]], [[thistle]], [[tomato]]es (well liked), [[turnip]], [[wheat]], [[yarrow]], [[zinnia]]. They will eat sweet [[lupin]]es, but will reject bitter [[lupin]]es and other plants with high [[quinolizidine]] [[alkaloid]]s. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.\n\nSnails usually prefer juicy leaves and vegetables over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed as it will quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% [[wheat bran]] while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use [[oats]], [[corn meal]], [[soybean meal]], or [[chicken]] mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed [[oyster]] shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their [[body weight]]. Active snails deprived of food will lose more than one-third of their weight before they starve to death\u2014a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.\n\nSupply calcium at least once a week if it is not available in the soil. It should not contain harmful salts or be so alkaline as to burn the snails. Mix calcium with wet bran or mashed potatoes and serve on a pan; this will keep any leftover food from rotting on the ground.\n\nSome researchers use chicken mash for feed. A plastic pipe can be cut in half lengthwise to make two troughs which can be used as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).\n\nPellets are fine for larger snails, but mash is better for younger ones. Pellets should be partially crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.\n\nBe sure to frequently clean the feed and water dishes. The amount of feed a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and on the availability of drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container to reduce the risk of the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.\n\nYoung ''H. aspersa'' readily eats [[milk powder]]. Its rapid rate of assimilation promotes rapid growth.\n\n== Diseases and pests ==\nGood hygiene can prevent the spread of disease and otherwise improve the health and growth rate of snails. Food is replaced daily in order to prevent spoilage. Earthworms added to the soil help keep the pen clean.\n\n[[Parasitism|Parasites]], [[nematode]]s, [[trematoda|trematodes]], [[fungi]], and micro[[arthropod]]s can attack snails, and such problems can spread rapidly when snail populations are dense. The bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' causes intestinal infections that can spread rapidly in a crowded snail pen.\n\nPossible predators include [[rat]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[Mole (animal)|moles]], [[skunk]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bird]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[lizard]]s, walking insects (e.g., some [[beetle]] and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] varieties), some types of [[Fly|flies]], [[centipede]]s, and even certain carnivorous snail species, such as ''[[Strangesta capillacea]]''.\n\n== Population density ==\nPopulation density also affects successful snail production. Pens should contain no more than six to eight fair-sized snails per square foot, or about four large ''H. pomatias''; or figure one kilogram per square meter (about .2 pounds of snail per square foot), which automatically compensates for the size of the snails. To encourage breeding, best results will occur with not more than eight snails per square meter (0.8 per square foot). Some sources say that, for ''H. pomatia'' to breed, 2 to 4 snails per square meter (0.2 to 0.4 per square foot) is the maximum.\n\nSnails tend not to breed when packed too densely or when the [[wikt:slime|slime]] in the pen accumulates too much. The slime apparently works like a [[pheromone]] and suppresses reproduction. On the other hand, snails in groups of about 100 seem to breed better than when only a few snails are confined together. Perhaps they have more potential mates from which to choose. Snails in a densely populated area grow more slowly even when food is abundant, and they also have a higher mortality rate. These snails then become smaller adults who lay fewer clutches of eggs, have fewer eggs per clutch, and the eggs have a lower hatch rate. Smaller adult snails sell for less. [[Dwarfing]] is quite common in snail farming and is attributable mainly to rearing conditions rather than [[heredity]] factors. Crowding snails is false economy. A recommended rate for ''H. aspersa'' is not more than one-third pound per square foot (3.6&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of soil surface for snails that weigh more than 1&nbsp;gram and not more than 0.2 pound per square foot (2.2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) for snails that weigh less. (One ounce is about 28&nbsp;grams.)\n\n== Turning snails into escargots ==\n{{Main|Escargot}}\nSnails are mature when a lip forms at the opening of their shell. Before they mature, their shells are more easily broken, making them undesirable. For ''H. aspersa'', commercial weight is 8&nbsp;grams or larger. The nutrient composition of raw snails (per 100&nbsp;grams of edible portion), according to information from the nutrient databank of France,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} is:\n* [[Food energy|Energy]]: 80.5 [[calorie|kcal]] (337 [[kilojoule|kJ]])\n* [[Water]]: 79 g\n* [[Protein]]: 16 g\n* Available [[carbohydrates]]: 2 g\n* [[Fiber]]: 0 g\n* [[Fat]]: 1 g\n* [[Magnesium]]: 250&nbsp;mg\n* [[Calcium]]: 170&nbsp;mg\n* [[Iron]]: 3.5&nbsp;mg\n* [[Vitamin C]]: 0&nbsp;mg\n\nSnail eggs are also harvested and processed to produce [[snail caviar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-12-15-snail-caviar-the-new-gourmet-frontier |title=Snail caviar!

Introduced slug and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably due in part to the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits high up on trees.\n\nThe [[Federal Plant Pest Act]] defines a plant pest as \"any living stage (including active and dormant forms) of [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[protozoa]], or other [[invertebrate]] animals, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], other [[parasite|parasitic plants]] or reproductive parts thereof; viruses; or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing; or any [[infection|infectious]] substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in or to any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants...\" The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) categorizes giant African snails as a \"quarantine significant plant pest.\" The United States does not allow live giant African snails into the country under any circumstances. It is illegal to own or to possess them. APHIS vigorously enforces this regulation and destroys or returns these snails to their country of origin.\n\nSince large infestations of snails can do devastating damage, many states have quarantines against nursery products, and other products, from infested states. Further, it is illegal to import snails (or slugs) into the U.S. without permission from the [[Plant Protection and Quarantine Division]] (PPQ), [[Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service]], U.S. Department of Agriculture. APHIS also oversees interstate transportation of snails. Anyone who plans to \"import, release, or make interstate shipments of\" snails, must complete APHIS's PPQ Form 526, Application and Permit to Move Live Plant Pests and Noxious Weeds. This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.\n\nInformation on Plant Pest Permits is available at APHIS's website [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm].\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates the canning of low-[[acid]] foods such as snails. According to FDA, \"establishments engaged in the manufacture of Low-acid or Acidified Canned Foods (LACF) offered for interstate commerce in the United States are required...to register their facility...and file scheduled processes for their products with\" the FDA. This does not refer to fresh products. For appropriate forms, contact: LACF Registration Coordinator, HFS-618, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 200 C Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20204. Telephone: (202) 205-5282. FAX: (202) 205-4758 or (202) 205-4128.\n\nImproper canning of low-acid meats, e.g., snails, involves a risk of [[botulism]]. When canning snails for home consumption, carefully follow canning instructions for low-acid meats to prevent food poisoning.\n\nState laws also may apply to imports into certain states and to raising snails in a given state. Some states may want to inspect and approve facilities. Thus anyone who plans to raise snails also should check with their State's Agriculture Department.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n* Rebecca Thompson and Sheldon Cheney [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm '''Raising Snails'''] \"[[National Agricultural Library]], [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].\"\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm |date=June 8, 2004 |title=Source of this article in Russian }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060711074205/http://bursaagricola.ro/Info-CRESTEREA_MELCILOR-4-23640-1.html Source of this article in] Romanian\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080728004505/http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/NAP/00-188.htm Breeding and Growing Snails Commercially in Australia]\n* [http://escargot.free.fr/eng/index.html Escargot Passion]\n* [https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/items/06-104 Free-range Snail Farming in Australia] Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Australian government\n* [http://www.manandmollusc.net/molluscan_food_files/molluscan_food_terrestrial.html Man and Mollusc's Data Base of Edible Molluscs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080416174658/http://www.sdnetwork.kabissa.org/newscollection/ideanews_1.htm#GrowSnail Snail Farming in Africa]\n* [http://www.snailcream.co.uk/heliculture/ Snail Farming (Heliculture)]\n* [http://africabusinessclassroom.com/snail-farming-in-nigeria-how-to-start-make-money/  Snail Farming in Nigeria]\n\n{{Edible molluscs}}\n\n[[Category:Agriculture]]\n[[Category:Gastropods and humans]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Eyragues-l-Escargot-des-Alpilles-5738.jpg|thumb|A snail farm near [[Eyragues]], [[Provence]], [[France]]]]\n'''Heliciculture''', commonly known as '''snail farming''', is the process of raising edible [[land snail]]s, primarily for human consumption or cosmetic use. The meat and  [[Snail caviar|snail eggs]] can be consumed as [[escargot]] and as a type of caviar respectively. Mucus, commonly known as [[snail slime]], has medical properties and is used in [[cosmetics]].\n\nPerhaps the best known edible land snail species in the [[Western world]] is the Helix pomatia, commonly known as [[Roman snail]] or [[Burgundy snail]]. This species is however not fit for profitable snail farming, and normally harvested from nature.\n\nCommercial snail farming in the Western world is typically done with either the ''[[Cornu aspersum]],'' formerly known as Helix ''aspersa'' M\u00fcller'','' or the [[Helix aspersa Maxima|Helix ''aspersa'' Maxima]]. In tropical climates snail farming is typically done with the ''[[African snail]],'' which biologically does not fall in the family of [[Helicidae]], and the meat of which therefore may not be called escargot.\n\n== History ==\nRoasted snail shells have been found in [[archaeological]] excavations, an indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times.<ref>[http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~dlubell/Antibes.pdf Prehistoric edible land snails in the circum-Mediterranean: the archaeological evidence.], D.

Lubell.</ref>\n\n''Lumaca romana'', (translation: Roman snail), was an ancient method of snail farming or heliciculture in the region about [[Tarquinia]]. This snail farming method was described by [[:la:Quintus Fulvius Lippinus|Fulvius Lippinus]] (49 BC) and mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ''De Re rustica'' III, 12.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/3*.html#12 De Re Rustica III, 12]</ref> The snails were fattened for human consumption using [[spelt]] and aromatic herbs. People usually raised snails in pens near the house, and these pens were called \"[[:la:Cochlea (animal)|cochlea]].\"\n\nThe Romans, in particular, are known to have considered escargot as an elite food, as noted in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. The Romans selected the best snails for breeding. Shells of the edible land snail species ''[[Otala lactea]]'' have been recovered in [[archaeological]] excavations of [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906]</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described the snail garden of [[Fulvius Hirpinus]] 2,000 years ago as having separate sections for different species of snails. [[Hirpinus]] allegedly fed his snails on meal and wine.\n\n\"Wall fish\" were also often eaten in Britain, but were never as popular as on the continent. There, people often ate snails during [[Lent]], and in a few places, they consumed large quantities of snails at Mardi Gras or Carnival, as a foretaste of Lent.\n\nAccording to some sources, the French exported [[Helix aspersa|brown garden snails]] to California in the 1850s, raising them as the delicacy [[escargot]]. Other sources claim that Italian immigrants were the first to bring the snail to the United States.\n\n== Economic impact ==\nU.S. imports of snails were worth more than $4.5 million in 1995 and came from 24 countries. This includes preserved or prepared snails and snails that are live, fresh, chilled, or frozen. Major exporters to the U.S. are [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Greece]] and [[China]]. The U.S. exported live, fresh, chilled, or frozen snails worth $55,000 to 13 countries; most were shipped to [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Individual statistics are not available for U.S. exports of prepared or processed snails from the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]].\n\n== List of edible land snail species ==\n[[File:Snails-Italy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Three different species of snails for sale in a market in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]\nEdible land snails range in size from about one millimeter long to the giant African snails, which occasionally grow up to {{convert|312|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in length. \"Escargot\" most commonly refers to either ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' or to ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', although other varieties of snails are eaten. ''[[Achatina fulica]]'', a giant African snail, is sliced and [[Canning|canned]] and passed off on some consumers as escargot. Terms such as \"garden snail\" or \"common brown garden snail\" are rather meaningless since they refer to so many types of snails, but they sometimes mean ''H. aspersa''.\n* ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' is also known as the French \"petit gris,\" \"small grey snail,\" the \"escargot chagrine,\" or \"la zigrinata.\" The shell of a mature adult has four to five whorls and measures 30 to 45&nbsp;mm across. It is native to the shores of the Mediterranean and up the coast of Spain and France. It is found on many British Isles, where the Romans introduced it in the 1st century AD (Some references say it dates to the Early Bronze Age.) In the early 19th century the French brought it into California, where it has become a serious pest. These snails are now common throughout the U.S. It was introduced into several Eastern and Gulf states even before 1850 and, later introduced into other countries such as Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, and Argentina. ''C. aspersum'' has a life span of 2 to 5 years. This species is more adaptable to different climates and conditions than many snails, and is found in woods, fields, sand dunes, and gardens. This adaptability not only increases ''C. aspersum's'' range, but it also makes farming ''C. aspersum'' easier and less risky.\n* ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It also is called the \"Roman snail,\" \"apple snail,\" \"lunar,\" \"la vignaiola,\" the German \"Weinbergschnecke,\" the French \"escargot de Bourgogne\" or \"Burgundy snail,\" or \"gros blanc.\" Native over a large part of Europe, it lives in wooded mountains and valleys up to {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} altitude and in vineyards and gardens. The Romans may have introduced it into Britain. Immigrants introduced it into the U.S. in Michigan and Wisconsin. Many prefer ''H. pomatia'' to ''H. aspersa'' for its flavor and its larger size, as the \"escargot par excellence.\"\n* ''[[Otala lactea]]'' is sometimes called the \"vineyard snail,\" \"milk snail,\" or \"Spanish snail.\" The shell is white with reddish brown spiral bands and measures about 26 to 35&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n* ''[[Iberus alonensis]]'', the Spanish \"vaqueta\" or \"serrana,\" measures about 30&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n[[File:Cepaea nemoralis pair banded shells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'']]\n* ''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'', the \"grove snail,\" or the Spanish \"vaqueta,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm across the shell. It inhabits Central Europe and was introduced into, and is now naturalized in many U.S. states, from Massachusetts to California, and from Tennessee to Canada. Its habitat ranges widely from woods to dunes. It mainly eats dead plant material, but it likes nettles and buttercups and will eat dead worms and dead snails.\n* ''[[Cepaea hortensis]]'', the \"white-lipped snail,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm across the shell which often has distinct dark stripes. It is native to central and northern Europe. This species was introduced into Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in colonial times, but it never became established in these states. Its habitat varies but ''C. hortensis'' is found in colder and wetter places than ''C. nemoralis''. Their smaller size and some people's opinion that they do not taste as good make ''C. hortensis'' and ''C. nemoralis'' less popular than the larger European land snails.\n* ''[[Otala punctata]]'', called \"vaqueta\" in some parts of Spain, measures about 35&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n* ''[[Eobania vermiculata]]'', the \"vinyala,\" \"mongeta,\" or \"xona,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm. It is found in Mediterranean countries and was introduced into Louisiana and Texas.\n* ''[[Helix lucorum]]'', sometimes called \"escargo turc,\" measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It is found in central Italy and from Yugoslavia through the Crimea to Turkey and around the Black Sea.\n* ''[[Helix adanensis]]'' comes from around Turkey.\n* ''[[Helix aperta]]'' measures about 25&nbsp;mm. Its meat is highly prized. It is native to France, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries and has become established in California and Louisiana. Sometimes known as the \"burrowing snail,\" it is found above ground only during rainy weather. In hot, dry weather, it burrows three to six inches into the ground and becomes dormant until rain soften the soil.\n* ''[[Theba pisana]]'', also called the \"banded snail\"or the \"cargol avellanenc,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm and lives on dry, exposed sites, usually near the sea. Native to Sicily, it has been spread to several European countries, including England. This snail is a serious garden pest and is the \"white snail\" that California once eradicated by using flamethrowers to burn off whole areas. In large numbers, up to 3,000 snails per tree, it can ravage a garden in 24 hours and a citrus or other crop in a couple of nights.\n* ''[[Sphincterochila candidissima]]'' or ''[[Leucochroa candidisima]]'', the \"cargol mongeta,\" or \"cargol jueu\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm.\n[[File:Achatina fulica Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Achatina fulica]]'']]\n* ''[[Achatina fulica]]'' and other ''Achatina'' species, giant African snails. They can grow up to 326&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;ft \u00be in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate ''Achatina''. The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/29/illegal-giant-snails-threatening-america/|title=Illegal giant snails threatening America|date=2014-08-29|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant \"tiger stripes\" on their shells.\n\n== Mating and egg laying ==\n\n=== General ===\nSnails are [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although they have both male and female [[reproductive organ]]s, they must mate with another snail of the same species before they lay eggs. Some snails may act as males one season and as females the next. Other snails play both roles at once and [[fertilize]] each other simultaneously. When the snail is large enough and mature enough, which may take several years, mating occurs in the late spring or early summer after several hours of [[courtship]]. Sometimes there is a second mating in summer. (In tropical climates, mating may occur several times a year. In some climates, snails mate around October and may mate a second time 2 weeks later.) After mating, the snail can store sperm received for up to a year, but it usually lays eggs within a few weeks. Snails are sometimes uninterested in mating with another snail of the same species that originated from a considerable distance away. For example, a ''H. aspersa'' from southern France may reject a ''H. aspersa'' from northern France.\n\n=== ''Helix pomatia'' ===\nSnails need soil at least 2&nbsp;inches deep in which to lay their eggs. For ''H. pomatia'', the soil should be at least 3&nbsp;inches deep to keep out pests such as [[ants]], [[earwig]]s, [[millipede]]s, etc. Dry soil is not suitable for the preparation of a nest, nor is soil that is too heavy. In clay soil that becomes hard, reproduction rates may decrease because the snails are unable to bury their eggs and the hatchlings have difficulty emerging from the nest. Hatchability of eggs depends on soil temperature, soil humidity, soil composition, etc. Soil consisting of 20% to 40% organic material is good. The soil should be kept at {{convert|41|to|50|F|C}}, and is best around {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Soil moisture should be maintained at 80%. One researcher removes eggs immediately after they are deposited, counts them, then keeps them on moist cotton until the eggs hatch and the young start to eat. Snails lose substantial weight by laying eggs. Some do not recover. About one-third of the snails will die after the breeding season.\n\n''H. pomatia'' eggs measure about 3&nbsp;mm in diameter and have a [[calcareous]] shell and a high [[yolk]] content. ''H. pomatia'' lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only the top of the shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is [[glycoprotein]] similar to eggwhite.\n\nFully developed baby ''H. pomatia'' snails hatch about 3 to 4 weeks after the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes as deep as {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}, and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This is a response to both decreasing temperature and shorter hours of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.\n\n=== ''Helix aspersa'' ===\n''H. aspersa'' eggs are white, spherical, about {{cvt|3|mm|in|frac=8}} in diameter and are laid 5 days to 3 weeks after mating. (Data varies widely due to differences in climate and regional variations in the snails' habitats.) ''H. aspersa'' lays an average of 85 eggs in a nest that is {{convert|1|to|1+1/2|in|cm}} deep. Data varies from 30 to over 120 eggs, but high figures may be from when more than one snail lays eggs in the same nest.\n\nIn warm, damp climates, ''H. aspersa'' may lay eggs as often as five times from February through October, depending on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when there are at least 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days to break out of the sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, ''H. aspersa'' matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, ''H. aspersa'' hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early [[hatchlings]], the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some ''H. aspersa'' mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of ''H. aspersa's'' reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.\n\n=== ''Achatina fulica'' ===\nBy contrast, one giant African snail, ''Achatina fulica'', lays 100 to 400 [[elliptical]] eggs that each measure about 5&nbsp;mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, usually in the wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like ''H. pomatia'', or lay eggs on the surface of a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4&nbsp;mm long. These snails grow up to 10&nbsp;mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35&nbsp;mm long and may already be sexually mature. [[Sexual maturity]] takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of [[calcium]]. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.\n\n== Growth ==\nWithin the same snail population and under the same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild. However, a snail farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in only a couple of generations. Most of the differences in growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.\n\nSeveral factors can greatly influence the growth of snails including: population density, stress (snails are sensitive to noise, light, vibration, unsanitary conditions, irregular feedings, being touched, etc.), feed, temperature and moisture, and the breeding technology used.\n\n''H. aspersa'' requires at least 3% to 4% calcium in the soil (or another source of calcium) for good growth. Most snails need more calcium in the soil than ''H. aspersa''. Low calcium intake will slow the growth rate and cause the shell to be thinner. Calcium may be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. Food is only one calcium source. Snails may eat paint or attack walls of buildings seeking calcium, and they also will eat dirt.\n\nA newborn's shell size depends on the egg size since the shell develops from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; there will be no further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.\n\nDryness inhibits growth and even stops activity. When it becomes too hot and dry in summer, the snail becomes inactive, seals its shell and [[estivation|estivates]] (becomes dormant) until cooler, moister weather returns. Some snails estivate in groups on tree trunks, posts, or walls. They seal themselves to the surface, thus sealing up the shell opening.\n\nPeak snail activity (including feeding and thus growth) occurs a few hours after sunset, when the temperature is lower and the water content (in the form of [[dew]]) is higher. During daytime snails usually seek shelter.\n\n== Farming snails ==\nSuccessful snail culture requires the correct equipment and supplies, including: [[snail pens]] or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity ([[hygrometer]]), temperature ([[thermometer]]), soil moisture ([[soil moisture sensor]]), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and an instrument to measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate ([[temperature]] and [[humidity]]), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails of the same kind and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.\n\nFour systems of snail farms can be distinguished:\n* Outdoor pens.\n* In buildings with a controlled climate.\n* In closed systems such as plastic tunnel houses or \"[[greenhouse]]s.\"\n* In addition, snails may breed and hatch inside in a controlled environment and then (after 6 to 8 weeks) may be placed in outside pens to mature.\n\n=== Favorable conditions ===\n\n'''Climate''': A mild climate {{convert|15|-|25|C|F}} with high humidity (75% to 95%) is best for snail farming, though most varieties can stand a wider range of temperatures. The optimal temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for many varieties. When the temperature falls below {{convert|7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, snails hibernate. Under {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} the snails are inactive, and under {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, all growth stops. When the temperature rises much above {{convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} or conditions become too dry, snails estivate. Wind is bad for snails because it speeds up moisture loss, and snails must retain moisture.\n\n'''Moisture''': Snails thrive in damp but not waterlogged environments and thus a well-draining soil is required. Research indicates that water content around 80% of the carrying capacity of the soil and air [[humidity]] over 80% (during darkness) are the most favorable conditions. Many farmers use [[Aerosol spray|mist-producing devices]] to maintain proper moisture in the air and/or soil.<ref>http://publications.cta.int/publications/publication/1497/</ref> Also, if the system contains alive vegetation, the leaves are to be periodically wet.\n\n'''[[Soil]]''': Snails dig in soil and ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and provides some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will eat only one or the other.\n\nA well-functional soil would have the following characteristics:\n* Containing neither a lot of [[sand]] nor too much [[clay]], as snails strive to dig into hard clay and sand dries out easily.\n* 20\u201340% organic matter content. Organic matter enhances [[cation exchange capacity]] of calcium and [[magnesium]] which in turn stimulates growth.\n* [[pH]] around 7.\n* Adequate [[calcium]], the primary constituent of shells (up to 98%). A common way to introduce calcium is to add ground [[limestone]] at a suggested concentration of {{convert|0.5|kg/m2|lb/sqft}}. Calcium may also be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. More advanced techniques involve the addition of [[polyacrylamide]] with the following concentration: 12.5&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of a 160&nbsp;g M.A./one preparation in 250 cc of water per kilogram of dry soil. Such stabilization treatment helps the soil structure resist washing and allows regular cleaning without destroying the crumb structure of the soil that is beneficial for egg laying.\n\nSoil care: A farmer must find a way to prevent the soil from becoming fouled with mucus and droppings and also tackle undesirable [[Soil chemistry|chemical changes]] that may occur in time.\n\nSoil mix suggestions:\n* [[peat]], clay, [[compost]] and [[calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]]\n* [[Leaf mold]] (at pH 7)\n\n== Pens and enclosures ==\n\nThe U.S. [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] ([[APHIS]]) Standards for [[Snail-Rearing Facilities]] were revised March 2001 and are available on the APHIS website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415075557/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |archive-date=2006-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEnclosures for snails are usually long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers to walk around (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The enclosure may be a trough with sides made of [[wood]], [[Concrete masonry unit|block]], [[fiber cement sheets]], or [[galvanized]] [[sheet steel]]. Cover it with [[Sieve|screen]] or [[netting]]. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} high plus at least {{convert|5|in|cm}} into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine mesh screen) on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5&nbsp;mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences. Pens containing baby snails need a finer mesh.\n\nSnails need hiding places, especially during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local [[garden center]] can be split in two lengthwise, and stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.\n\nA sprinkler system ensures moisture when needed and can be turned on at sunset rather than earlier in the day, when the moisture may drive snails out into hot sunshine. Temperature and humidity can be monitored using a thermometer and a hygrometer.\n\nThe bottom of the enclosure, if it is not the ground or trays of dirt, needs be a surface more solid than screening. A snail placed in a wire-mesh-bottom pen will keep crawling, trying to get off the wires and onto solid, more comfortable ground.\n\nIn order to prevent escapes, in an open pen, the top of the fences curve inward in a half circle; this works to confine the vineyard snail. However, ''H. aspersa'' can escape from such an open pen, and an electric fence may be needed to contain them. [The [[electric fence]] top has two or more thin wires that are 2 to 4&nbsp;mm apart. Each wire carries the opposite charge of the wire next to it. A battery or transformer is used to supply 4 to 12 [[volt]]s to the wire. A snail will get a mild shock and retract when it crawls over a wire and touches a second wire.]\n\nAnother technique to confine snails is to bend the fence top inward into a sharp \"V\" shape with about a 20-degree angle. The snail's shell will hit the bent-back part of the screen before the snail can reach up and start crawling on it. This blocks the snail, and the angled screen automatically compensates for the size of the snail.\n\nAnother alternative, suitable for solid wall enclosures, is to attach to the wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls on the underside of the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.\n\nBecause snails usually will not cross a [[copper]] band, another solution is to top the fence with a copper band at least {{convert|3|in|cm|round=5}} wide. The band can be bent so that part of it faces inward and is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.\n\nAn alternate method is to make a square pen with a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}}-square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., [[Urtica|nettles]] and [[artichoke]]s, inside the pen. The snails will choose what they want to eat. If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless the snails are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if the snails are not mature at the end of the year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.\n\nPlastic tunnels make cheap, easy snail enclosures, but it is difficult to regulate heat and humidity. The tunnel will be {{convert|10|to|20|F-change|C-change|0}} warmer than the outside, and snails become dormant when the temperature climbs above {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhen snails are raised indoors under controlled conditions, reproduction varies according to the geographic origin of the [[breeding stock]]. For example, one researcher found that ''H. aspersa'' snails from [[Brittany]] seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at {{convert|70|F|C}} and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The [[Center for Heliciculture]] once recommended 65\u201375% humidity during the day and 85\u201395% at night at {{convert|68|F|C}}. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For ''H. aspersa'', the optimum temperature for hatching eggs seems to be {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at {{convert|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.\n\n[[Fluorescent lamp]]s can be used to give artificial daylight. Different snails respond to day length in different ways. The ratio of light to darkness influences activity, feeding, and mating and egg-laying. Eighteen or more hours of light apparently stimulate ''H. aspersa'' growth, while less than 12 hours inhibit it. Some snail species may associates the long hours of light with the start of summer\u2014the peak growing season. Eighteen hours of daylight also appear optimal for breeding (mating and egg laying), but snails will breed in darkness.\n\nSnails can be bred in boxes or cages stacked several units high. An automatic sprinkler system can be used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about {{convert|3|in|cm}} deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.)\n\nWhen the snails have laid their eggs, the pots are put in a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails are kept in the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a separate pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.\n\nBaby snails are fed on tender [[lettuce]] leaves ([[Boston lettuce|Boston]] type, but [[head lettuce|head]] type is probably also good.)\n\nSome who raise ''H. aspersa'' separate the five stages: reproduction, hatching, young, fattening, and final fattening.\n\nIn a typical example, the [[Reproduction|breeding]] box has [[concrete]] sides, soil with [[earthworm]]s (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a chicken waterer. [[Mosquito]] netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better results may be obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouse\u2014as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those he had that year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.\n\n[[Fattening pens]] can be outside or in a greenhouse. High summer temperatures and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails. This is more a problem inside greenhouses if the sun overheats the building. A sprinkler system (e.g., a [[horticultural]] system or common lawn sprinklers) can supply moisture. Make sure excess water can drain.\n\nFattening pens may contain {{convert|2|by|3|ft|m|adj=on}} pieces (or other convenient size) of heavy plastic sheets, hung from boards resting on a rack that lets the tips of the plastic sheets just touch the ground. The plastic sheets are about {{convert|4|in|cm}} apart. The sheets give the snails a resting and hiding place. Feeders may be located on the rack that supports the plastic sheets.\n\nA layer of coarse sand and [[topsoil]] with earthworms is placed on the fattening pen's bottom. The worms help clean up the snail droppings.\n\nSnails that hatched the previous summer can be put in a chilled room for hibernation over winter. About 1 April, (adjusted for local climate), they are moved to the final fattening pen. IN cases where there are several fattening pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of ''H. aspersa'' snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For ''H. aspersa'', 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.\n\n== Cannibalism by hatchlings ==\nThe first snails to hatch eat the shells of their eggs. This gives them calcium needed for their shells. They may then begin eating unhatched eggs. If the snail eggs are kept at the optimum temperature, {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} (for some varieties), and if none of the eggs lose moisture, most eggs will hatch within 1 to 3 days of each other. [[Cannibalism]] also will be low. If hatching extends over a longer period, cannibalism may increase. Some eggs eaten are eggs that were not fertile or did not develop properly, but sometimes, properly developing embryos might be eaten. A high density of \"clutches\" of egg masses increases the rate of cannibalism, as other nearby egg masses are more likely to be found and eaten. Snail egg has 12 to 20 times the protein of lettuce. The protein helps the baby snails start developing quickly and be healthier. Snail egg is an excellent starter food for newly hatched snails, but they tend to only eat eggs of their own species.\n\n== Feeding ==\nFeeding season is April through October, (or may vary with the local climate), with a \"rest period\" during the summer. Do not place food in one small clump so that there is not enough room for all the snails to get to it. Snails eat solid food by [[rasping]] it away with their [[radula]]. Feeding activity depends on the weather, and snails may not necessarily feed every day. Evening irrigation in dry weather may encourage feeding since the moisture makes it easier for the snails to move about.\n\nPut the breeding snails in the breeding pens in April or early May. Feed until mid June when mating begins and the snails stop feeding. Snails resume eating after they lay eggs. Once snails have laid their eggs, the adult snails can be removed. This leaves more food and less crowding for the hatchlings.\n\nSnails of the same species collected from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: [[Alyssum]], fruit and leaves of [[apple]], [[apricot]], [[artichoke]] (a favorite), [[Aster (genus)|aster]], [[barley]], [[beans]], [[bindweed]], [[California boxwood]], almost any [[cabbage]] variety, [[camomile]], [[carnation]], [[carrot]], [[cauliflower]], [[celeriac]] (root celery), [[celery]], ripe [[cherries]], [[chive]], citrus, [[clover]], [[cucumber]]s (a favorite snail food), [[dandelion]], [[Elderberry|elder]], [[henbane]], [[hibiscus]], [[hollyhock]], [[kale]], larkspur ([[Consolida]] or [[Delphinium]] genera), [[leek]], lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), [[lily]], [[magnolia]], [[mountain ash]], [[mulberry]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]], [[Urtica|nettle]], [[nightshade]] berries, [[oats]], [[onion]] greens, [[pansy]], [[parsley]], [[peach]], ripe [[pear]]s, [[pea]]s, [[petunia]], [[phlox]], [[plum]], [[potato]]es (raw or cooked), [[pumpkin]]s, [[radish]], [[rapeseed|rape]], [[rose]], [[sorrel]], [[spinach]], [[sweet pea]], [[thistle]], [[tomato]]es (well liked), [[turnip]], [[wheat]], [[yarrow]], [[zinnia]]. They will eat sweet [[lupin]]es, but will reject bitter [[lupin]]es and other plants with high [[quinolizidine]] [[alkaloid]]s. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.\n\nSnails usually prefer juicy leaves and vegetables over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed as it will quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% [[wheat bran]] while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use [[oats]], [[corn meal]], [[soybean meal]], or [[chicken]] mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed [[oyster]] shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their [[body weight]]. Active snails deprived of food will lose more than one-third of their weight before they starve to death\u2014a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.\n\nSupply calcium at least once a week if it is not available in the soil. It should not contain harmful salts or be so alkaline as to burn the snails. Mix calcium with wet bran or mashed potatoes and serve on a pan; this will keep any leftover food from rotting on the ground.\n\nSome researchers use chicken mash for feed. A plastic pipe can be cut in half lengthwise to make two troughs which can be used as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).\n\nPellets are fine for larger snails, but mash is better for younger ones. Pellets should be partially crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.\n\nBe sure to frequently clean the feed and water dishes. The amount of feed a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and on the availability of drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container to reduce the risk of the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.\n\nYoung ''H. aspersa'' readily eats [[milk powder]]. Its rapid rate of assimilation promotes rapid growth.\n\n== Diseases and pests ==\nGood hygiene can prevent the spread of disease and otherwise improve the health and growth rate of snails. Food is replaced daily in order to prevent spoilage. Earthworms added to the soil help keep the pen clean.\n\n[[Parasitism|Parasites]], [[nematode]]s, [[trematoda|trematodes]], [[fungi]], and micro[[arthropod]]s can attack snails, and such problems can spread rapidly when snail populations are dense. The bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' causes intestinal infections that can spread rapidly in a crowded snail pen.\n\nPossible predators include [[rat]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[Mole (animal)|moles]], [[skunk]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bird]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[lizard]]s, walking insects (e.g., some [[beetle]] and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] varieties), some types of [[Fly|flies]], [[centipede]]s, and even certain carnivorous snail species, such as ''[[Strangesta capillacea]]''.\n\n== Population density ==\nPopulation density also affects successful snail production. Pens should contain no more than six to eight fair-sized snails per square foot, or about four large ''H. pomatias''; or figure one kilogram per square meter (about .2 pounds of snail per square foot), which automatically compensates for the size of the snails. To encourage breeding, best results will occur with not more than eight snails per square meter (0.8 per square foot). Some sources say that, for ''H. pomatia'' to breed, 2 to 4 snails per square meter (0.2 to 0.4 per square foot) is the maximum.\n\nSnails tend not to breed when packed too densely or when the [[wikt:slime|slime]] in the pen accumulates too much. The slime apparently works like a [[pheromone]] and suppresses reproduction. On the other hand, snails in groups of about 100 seem to breed better than when only a few snails are confined together. Perhaps they have more potential mates from which to choose. Snails in a densely populated area grow more slowly even when food is abundant, and they also have a higher mortality rate. These snails then become smaller adults who lay fewer clutches of eggs, have fewer eggs per clutch, and the eggs have a lower hatch rate. Smaller adult snails sell for less. [[Dwarfing]] is quite common in snail farming and is attributable mainly to rearing conditions rather than [[heredity]] factors. Crowding snails is false economy. A recommended rate for ''H. aspersa'' is not more than one-third pound per square foot (3.6&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of soil surface for snails that weigh more than 1&nbsp;gram and not more than 0.2 pound per square foot (2.2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) for snails that weigh less. (One ounce is about 28&nbsp;grams.)\n\n== Turning snails into escargots ==\n{{Main|Escargot}}\nSnails are mature when a lip forms at the opening of their shell. Before they mature, their shells are more easily broken, making them undesirable. For ''H. aspersa'', commercial weight is 8&nbsp;grams or larger. The nutrient composition of raw snails (per 100&nbsp;grams of edible portion), according to information from the nutrient databank of France,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} is:\n* [[Food energy|Energy]]: 80.5 [[calorie|kcal]] (337 [[kilojoule|kJ]])\n* [[Water]]: 79 g\n* [[Protein]]: 16 g\n* Available [[carbohydrates]]: 2 g\n* [[Fiber]]: 0 g\n* [[Fat]]: 1 g\n* [[Magnesium]]: 250&nbsp;mg\n* [[Calcium]]: 170&nbsp;mg\n* [[Iron]]: 3.5&nbsp;mg\n* [[Vitamin C]]: 0&nbsp;mg\n\nSnail eggs are also harvested and processed to produce [[snail caviar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-12-15-snail-caviar-the-new-gourmet-frontier |title=Snail caviar! The new gourmet frontier |newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]] |date=December 15, 2007 |accessdate=21 January 2015 |author=Bertrand, Jordane}}</ref>\n\n== Restrictions and regulations in the United States ==\nThe same snails that some people raise or gather as food also are agricultural pests that cause considerable crop damage. Introduced slug and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably due in part to the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits high up on trees.\n\nThe [[Federal Plant Pest Act]] defines a plant pest as \"any living stage (including active and dormant forms) of [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[protozoa]], or other [[invertebrate]] animals, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], other [[parasite|parasitic plants]] or reproductive parts thereof; viruses; or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing; or any [[infection|infectious]] substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in or to any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants...\" The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) categorizes giant African snails as a \"quarantine significant plant pest.\" The United States does not allow live giant African snails into the country under any circumstances. It is illegal to own or to possess them. APHIS vigorously enforces this regulation and destroys or returns these snails to their country of origin.\n\nSince large infestations of snails can do devastating damage, many states have quarantines against nursery products, and other products, from infested states. Further, it is illegal to import snails (or slugs) into the U.S. without permission from the [[Plant Protection and Quarantine Division]] (PPQ), [[Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service]], U.S. Department of Agriculture. APHIS also oversees interstate transportation of snails. Anyone who plans to \"import, release, or make interstate shipments of\" snails, must complete APHIS's PPQ Form 526, Application and Permit to Move Live Plant Pests and Noxious Weeds. This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.\n\nInformation on Plant Pest Permits is available at APHIS's website [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm].\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates the canning of low-[[acid]] foods such as snails. According to FDA, \"establishments engaged in the manufacture of Low-acid or Acidified Canned Foods (LACF) offered for interstate commerce in the United States are required...to register their facility...and file scheduled processes for their products with\" the FDA. This does not refer to fresh products. For appropriate forms, contact: LACF Registration Coordinator, HFS-618, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 200 C Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20204. Telephone: (202) 205-5282. FAX: (202) 205-4758 or (202) 205-4128.\n\nImproper canning of low-acid meats, e.g., snails, involves a risk of [[botulism]]. When canning snails for home consumption, carefully follow canning instructions for low-acid meats to prevent food poisoning.\n\nState laws also may apply to imports into certain states and to raising snails in a given state. Some states may want to inspect and approve facilities. Thus anyone who plans to raise snails also should check with their State's Agriculture Department.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n* Rebecca Thompson and Sheldon Cheney [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm '''Raising Snails'''] \"[[National Agricultural Library]], [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].\"\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm |date=June 8, 2004 |title=Source of this article in Russian }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060711074205/http://bursaagricola.ro/Info-CRESTEREA_MELCILOR-4-23640-1.html Source of this article in] Romanian\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080728004505/http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/NAP/00-188.htm Breeding and Growing Snails Commercially in Australia]\n* [http://escargot.free.fr/eng/index.html Escargot Passion]\n* [https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/items/06-104 Free-range Snail Farming in Australia] Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Australian government\n* [http://www.manandmollusc.net/molluscan_food_files/molluscan_food_terrestrial.html Man and Mollusc's Data Base of Edible Molluscs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080416174658/http://www.sdnetwork.kabissa.org/newscollection/ideanews_1.htm#GrowSnail Snail Farming in Africa]\n* [http://www.snailcream.co.uk/heliculture/ Snail Farming (Heliculture)]\n* [http://africabusinessclassroom.com/snail-farming-in-nigeria-how-to-start-make-money/  Snail Farming in Nigeria]\n\n{{Edible molluscs}}\n\n[[Category:Agriculture]]\n[[Category:Gastropods and humans]]\n", "name_user": "Chescargot", "label": "safe", "comment": "link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliciculture"}

It is also within the [[Greater Houston|Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land]] metropolitan area at its southern end on the northwestern coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n\nGalveston, or Galvez' town, was named after the Spanish military and political leader in the 18th century: [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez y Madrid, Count of G\u00e1lvez]] (1746\u20131786), who was born in [[Macharaviaya]], [[M\u00e1laga]], in the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. Galveston's first [[Europe]]an settlements on the [[Galveston Island]] were built around 1816 by [[Kingdom of France|French]] pirate [[Louis-Michel Aury]] to help the fledgling [[Republic of Mexico]] fight for independence from [[Spain]], along with other colonies in the  [[Western Hemisphere]] of the [[Americas]] in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] in the 1810s and 1820s. The [[Port of Galveston]] was established in 1825 by the [[Congress of Mexico]] following its independence from Spain. The city was the main port for the fledgling [[Texas Navy]] during the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836, and later served temporarily as the new national capital of the  [[Republic of Texas]].\n\nDuring the 19th century, Galveston became a major U.S. commercial center and one of the largest [[port]]s in the [[United States]]. It was for a time, Texas' largest city, known as the \"Queen City of the Gulf\". It was devastated by the unexpected [[1900 Galveston hurricane|Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], whose effects included massive flooding and a storm surge which nearly wiped out the town. The natural disaster on the exposed [[barrier island]] is still ranked today as the deadliest in United States history, with an estimated death toll of 6,000 to 12,000 people. The city subsequently reemerged during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]] of 1919\u20131933 as a leading tourist hub and a [[Free State of Galveston|center of illegal gambling]], nicknamed the [[Free State of Galveston]] until this era ended in the 1950s with subsequent other economic and social development.\n\nMuch of Galveston's economy is centered in the [[tourism]], [[health care]], [[shipping]], and [[finance|financial]] industries. The {{convert|84|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] campus with an enrollment of more than 2,500 students is a major economic force of the city. Galveston is home to six [[historic districts]] containing one of the largest and historically significant collections of 19th-century buildings in the U.S., with over 60 structures listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], maintained by the [[National Park Service]] in the [[United States Department of the Interior]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Galveston, Texas}}\n\n===Exploration and 19th-century development===\n[[File:Plan of the City of Galveston, Texas.jpg|thumb|Plan of the City of Galveston, Texas (circa 1845)]][[File:Map of City of Galveston.jpg|thumb|Map of City of Galveston (circa 1904)]]\nIndigenous inhabitants of Galveston Island called the island <i>Auia</i>.<ref name=McComb1>{{cite book|last=McComb|first=David G.|title=Galveston: A History|location=Austin|publisher=University of Texas Press|chapter=\u201dThe Edge of Time\u201d|year=1986|ISBN=978-0292-720534}}</ref> Though there is no certainty regarding their route and their landings, Cabeza de Vaca and his crew were shipwrecked at a place he called \u201cIsla de Malhado\u201d in November 1528.

He was working under the orders of Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez.

Just five years later Alexander von Humboldt borrows the place names Isla de San Luis, Pte. De Culebras, and Bahia de Galveston. Stephen F. Austin followed his predecessors in the use of \u201cSan Luis Island,\u201d but introduced \u201cGalveston\u201d to refer to the little village at the east end of the island.

Development was also hindered by the construction of the [[Houston Ship Channel]], which brought the [[Port of Houston]] into competition with the natural harbor of the [[Port of Galveston]] for sea traffic. To further her recovery, and rebuild her population, Galveston actively solicited immigration. Through the efforts of [[Henry Cohen (rabbi)|Rabbi Henry Cohen]] and [[Congregation B'nai Israel (Galveston, Texas)|Congregation B'nai Israel]], Galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the [[Galveston Movement]] that, between 1907 and 1914, diverted roughly 10,000 [[Eastern Europe]]an [[Jewish]] immigrants from the usual destinations of the crowded cities of the [[Northeastern United States]].<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">{{Cite web\n| title = Galveston Movement\n| work = Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State Historical Association\n| accessdate = October 3, 2009\n| url = https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/umg01\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101107164324/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/umg01\n| archive-date = November 7, 2010\n| url-status = live\n}}</ref> Additionally numerous other immigrant groups, including [[Greece|Greeks]], [[Italy|Italians]] and [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jews]], came to the city during this period.<ref name=\"Hardwick, p. 13\">Hardwick (2002), p. 13</ref> This immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island, as well as many other areas of Texas and the western U.S.\n\nThough the storm stalled economic development and the city of Houston developed as the region's principal metropolis, Galveston economic leaders recognized the need to diversify from the traditional port-related industries.

The city council appoints the city manager, the city secretary, the city auditor, the city attorney, and the municipal judge.

The city manager hires employees, promotes development, presents and administers the budget, and implements city council policies.

A new Galveston resident most recently from New York City, he laid out the streets based on a gridiron, and named the east\u2013west avenues according to letters of the alphabet, with Avenue A running along the back bay on the north side of the island. He assigned numbers to names of north\u2013south streets, with First Street on the far eastern side of the grid, and the numbered street names increased as they progressed westward. The names of some of the avenues changed over the years. Most notably, Avenue B became known as The Strand, and Avenue J became known as Broadway, a major thoroughfare which runs from the Interstate-45 viaduct to Seawall Boulevard.<ref name=mccomb>{{cite book|title=Galveston: A History|author=David G.

It is also within the [[Greater Houston|Houston\u2013The Woodlands\u2013Sugar Land]] metropolitan area at its southern end on the northwestern coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n\nGalveston, or Galvez' town, was named after the Spanish military and political leader in the 18th century: [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez y Madrid, Count of G\u00e1lvez]] (1746\u20131786), who was born in [[Macharaviaya]], [[M\u00e1laga]], in the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. Galveston's first [[Europe]]an settlements on the [[Galveston Island]] were built around 1816 by [[Kingdom of France|French]] pirate [[Louis-Michel Aury]] to help the fledgling [[Republic of Mexico]] fight for independence from [[Spain]], along with other colonies in the  [[Western Hemisphere]] of the [[Americas]] in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] in the 1810s and 1820s. The [[Port of Galveston]] was established in 1825 by the [[Congress of Mexico]] following its independence from Spain. The city was the main port for the fledgling [[Texas Navy]] during the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836, and later served temporarily as the new national capital of the  [[Republic of Texas]].\n\nDuring the 19th century, Galveston became a major U.S. commercial center and one of the largest [[port]]s in the [[United States]]. It was for a time, Texas' largest city, known as the \"Queen City of the Gulf\". It was devastated by the unexpected [[1900 Galveston hurricane|Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], whose effects included massive flooding and a storm surge which nearly wiped out the town. The natural disaster on the exposed [[barrier island]] is still ranked today as the deadliest in United States history, with an estimated death toll of 6,000 to 12,000 people. The city subsequently reemerged during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]] of 1919\u20131933 as a leading tourist hub and a [[Free State of Galveston|center of illegal gambling]], nicknamed the [[Free State of Galveston]] until this era ended in the 1950s with subsequent other economic and social development.\n\nMuch of Galveston's economy is centered in the [[tourism]], [[health care]], [[shipping]], and [[finance|financial]] industries. The {{convert|84|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] campus with an enrollment of more than 2,500 students is a major economic force of the city. Galveston is home to six [[historic districts]] containing one of the largest and historically significant collections of 19th-century buildings in the U.S., with over 60 structures listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], maintained by the [[National Park Service]] in the [[United States Department of the Interior]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Galveston, Texas}}\n\n===Exploration and 19th-century development===\n[[File:Plan of the City of Galveston, Texas.jpg|thumb|Plan of the City of Galveston, Texas (circa 1845)]][[File:Map of City of Galveston.jpg|thumb|Map of City of Galveston (circa 1904)]]\nIndigenous inhabitants of Galveston Island called the island <i>Auia</i>.<ref name=McComb1>{{cite book|last=McComb|first=David G.|title=Galveston: A History|location=Austin|publisher=University of Texas Press|chapter=\u201dThe Edge of Time\u201d|year=1986|ISBN=978-0292-720534}}</ref> Though there is no certainty regarding their route and their landings, Cabeza de Vaca and his crew were shipwrecked at a place he called \u201cIsla de Malhado\u201d in November 1528.

He was working under the orders of Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez. In his early chart, he calls the western end of the island \u201cIsla de San Luis\u201d and the eastern end, \u201cPt. de Culebras.\u201d Evia did not label the island itself on his map of 1799. Just five years later Alexander von Humboldt borrows the place names Isla de San Luis, Pte. De Culebras, and Bahia de Galveston. Stephen F. Austin followed his predecessors in the use of \u201cSan Luis Island,\u201d but introduced \u201cGalveston\u201d to refer to the little village at the east end of the island.

Development was also hindered by the construction of the [[Houston Ship Channel]], which brought the [[Port of Houston]] into competition with the natural harbor of the [[Port of Galveston]] for sea traffic. To further her recovery, and rebuild her population, Galveston actively solicited immigration. Through the efforts of [[Henry Cohen (rabbi)|Rabbi Henry Cohen]] and [[Congregation B'nai Israel (Galveston, Texas)|Congregation B'nai Israel]], Galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the [[Galveston Movement]] that, between 1907 and 1914, diverted roughly 10,000 [[Eastern Europe]]an [[Jewish]] immigrants from the usual destinations of the crowded cities of the [[Northeastern United States]].<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">{{Cite web\n| title = Galveston Movement\n| work = Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State Historical Association\n| accessdate = October 3, 2009\n| url = https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/umg01\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101107164324/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/umg01\n| archive-date = November 7, 2010\n| url-status = live\n}}</ref> Additionally numerous other immigrant groups, including [[Greece|Greeks]], [[Italy|Italians]] and [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jews]], came to the city during this period.<ref name=\"Hardwick, p. 13\">Hardwick (2002), p. 13</ref> This immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island, as well as many other areas of Texas and the western U.S.\n\nThough the storm stalled economic development and the city of Houston developed as the region's principal metropolis, Galveston economic leaders recognized the need to diversify from the traditional port-related industries.

The team also reached the quarter-final stage of the [[1964 European Nations' Cup]], where they lost to the eventual champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]].\n\nUnder the guidance of [[Jack Charlton]], the team enjoyed its most successful era, reaching their highest [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA world ranking]] ever at sixth in August 1993, and qualifying for [[UEFA Euro 1988]] in their first appearance at the [[UEFA European Championship]], reaching the quarter-finals of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in their first ever appearance at the finals, as well as making the last 16 at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 edition]]. Charlton's successor [[Mick McCarthy]] lost out on the next two major tournaments but ultimately qualified for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], making it to the last 16. Under [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], the team narrowly lost out on qualification for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] World Cup during a [[2009 Republic of Ireland v France football matches|controversial play-off]], but went on to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]].\n\nThe team failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] in Brazil, marking the end of Trapattoni's tenure as manager.

In 1920, Ireland [[Partition of Ireland|was partitioned]] into [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Irish Free State]] (the latter in turn becoming [[\u00c9ire]] or Ireland after adopting [[Constitution of Ireland|a new Constitution]] in 1937, followed by [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|declaring itself a republic]] in 1949.) Following the initial political upheavals surrounding Partition, a [[Dublin]]-based organisation calling itself the Football Association of the Irish Free State (FAIFS) split from the IFA in 1921 and began organising [[League of Ireland|its own league]] and national football team.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Football Association of Ireland: 75 years | first=Peter | last=Byrne | year=1996 | location=Dublin | publisher=Sportsworld | isbn = 1-900110-06-7 | page=22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, the FAIFS was recognised by [[FIFA]] as the governing body of football in the Irish Free State<ref>{{cite book|title=Football Association of Ireland: 75 years|first=Peter|last=Byrne|year=1996|location=Dublin|publisher=Sportsworld|isbn=1-900110-06-7|page=22}}</ref> and at the [[Ireland at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Summer Olympics]], the Irish Free State made their international debut.

During this entire period, there were two Irish international football teams, chosen by two rival Associations. Both Associations, the Northern Ireland-based IFA and the Irish Free State-based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and considered themselves entitled to select players from the entire island. At least 38 [[Dual Irish international footballers|dual internationals]] were selected to represent both teams,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nifootball.blogspot.com/2006/10/dual-internationalists.html|title=List of Dual Internationalists|publisher=Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats|first=Jonny|last=Dewart|date=23 October 2006}}</ref> however the overwhelming majority of these were Southerners who also agreed to play for the IFA team, with only a bare handful \"crossing the border\" in the other direction.\n\nA [[England v Ireland (1949)|2\u20130 win]] over [[England national football team|England]] at [[Goodison Park]] on 21 September 1949 was the first time England suffered a home defeat by a team outside the [[Home Nations|Home Countries]] of [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|Ireland]] team run by the Belfast-based [[Irish Football Association|Irish FA]]. FIFA eventually intervened when both teams entered [[1950 FIFA World Cup qualification|1950 World Cup qualification]], the first time they had entered the same competition. Four players \u2013 [[Tom Aherne]], [[Reg Ryan]], [[Davy Walsh]], [[Con Martin]] \u2013 actually played for the two different teams in the same FIFA World Cup tournament.<ref>Ryan, op. cit. pg 59.</ref> All four players concerned had been born in the Irish Free State and made their full international debut in FAI colours before agreeing to represent the IFA team. This may have alarmed the FAI, since they subsequently lobbied FIFA to prevent the IFA from picking Southern-born players (as well as attempting to exert pressure on the players themselves, sometimes through their clubs). FIFA's response was to restrict the eligibility of players on the basis of the (political) border, further ruling in 1953 that neither team could be referred to as ''Ireland'' in competitions which both teams were eligible to enter; i.e., initially the FIFA World Cup and subsequently the European Nations Cup (now the UEFA European Football Championship). FIFA decreed that the FAI team officially be called the ''Republic of Ireland'' while the IFA team was to be named [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].<ref>Byrne, op. cit., pg 68.</ref>\n\n===Republic of Ireland (1953\u20131968)===\nIn 1953, FIFA renamed the team from \"Ireland\" to \"Republic of Ireland\". The [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] qualifiers saw the Republic of Ireland drawn with England. In their home game against England, [[Alf Ringstead]] put the hosts 1\u20130 up before [[John Atyeo]] equalised in the last minute to salvage a 1\u20131 draw for England.

This was the first instance of a player born outside the Republic being selected to play for the national team due to having an Irish parent. Since then, many of the Republic's most prominent players have been born in England, including [[Mark Lawrenson]], [[David O'Leary]], [[John Aldridge]], [[Tony Cascarino]] and [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]]. A number of players born in Scotland, including [[Ray Houghton]], have since represented the Republic due to having Irish parentage. The selection rules were later relaxed to allow for the selection of players with an Irish grandparent.\n\n===Wilderness (1969\u20131985)===\nIn 1969, the FAI appointed [[Mick Meagan]] as the first permanent manager of the national side. His two years in charge were marked by exceptionally poor results, however with the team losing five out of six matches and gaining just one point in their [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|1970 World Cup qualification]], and doing no better in the [[UEFA Euro 1972]] qualifiers, leading to his dismissal. His replacement, [[Liam Tuohy (footballer)|Liam Tuohy]], did a somewhat better in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification|1974 qualification]], and more importantly oversaw major improvements to the national team's training facilities and persuaded many English club sides to end their policies of not releasing Irish players for international games during the domestic season. Ultimately, however, the team still failed to qualify for the World Cup, and Tuohy resigned following a dispute over his wages. [[Johnny Giles]] became the side's first player-manager in the 1970s.

The Republic of Ireland have also played home matches in [[Tolka Park]] (twice) and the [[RDS Arena]] in Dublin as well at the [[Mardyke]] and [[Flower Lodge]] grounds in Cork. These games in Cork were, until 2009, the only two home Irish internationals played outside of Dublin. During the construction of the [[Aviva Stadium]], two friendly games were played in [[Thomond Park]], [[Limerick]], in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.ie/breakingnews/sport/trap-aussies-gave-us-a-severe-lesson-422438.html|title=Trap: Aussies gave us 'a severe lesson'|date=13 August 2009|accessdate=13 August 2009|work=Irish Examiner}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0908/live_ireland_southafrica.html|title=Rep of Ireland 1\u20130 South Africa \u2013 Matchtracker|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=8 September 2009|publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport|first=Ed|last=Leahy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909220720/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0908/live_ireland_southafrica.html|archivedate=9 September 2009}}</ref> Two further friendlies were played in the RDS Arena in May 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/irish/8701396.stm|title=Republic of Ireland 2\u20131 Paraguay|date=25 May 2010|accessdate=25 May 2010|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/algeria/7779724/Republic-of-Ireland-3-Algeria-0-match-report.html|first=Mark|last=Ogden|title=Republic of Ireland 3 Algeria 0 : match report|date=28 May 2010|accessdate=28 May 2010|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> Ireland played a friendly against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] in Cork's 7,000 capacity [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]] stadium in May 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/euro-2016/euro-2016-teams/republic-of-ireland/irelands-euro-2016-warmup-ends-with-a-whimper-as-belarus-win-in-cork-34762798.html|title=Ireland's Euro 2016 warm-up ends with a whimper as Belarus win in Cork|first=Miguel|last=Delaney|work=Irish Independent|date=31 May 2016|accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Media coverage===\nIreland matches currently broadcast by [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann]] (RT\u00c9) (qualifiers only), [[Sky Sports]], and highlights on [[Virgin Media Television (Ireland)|Virgin Media Television]].

Between 1924 and 1936, the team competed as the '''Irish Free State''' and from then until 1950, it was referred to by the FAI as '''\u00c9ire''' or '''Ireland'''. In 1953, [[FIFA]] decreed that for competitive matches in tournaments that both Irish teams may enter, the FAI team would be officially called the Republic of Ireland while the [[Irish Football Association|IFA]] team was to be named [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nifootball.blogspot.com/2010/03/northern-ireland-programmes-1882-1889.html|title=NIFG: Northern Ireland Programmes 1968\u20131972|publisher=Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats|first=Jonny|last=Dewart|date=27 March 2010|accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref> Northern Ireland was allowed to use the title Ireland by FIFA in the Home International Competition until it was discontinued in 1984. The Republic of Ireland was the first nation from outside the United Kingdom to [[1949 England v Ireland football match|defeat]] [[England national football team|England]] at home in a fixture played at [[Goodison Park]], [[Liverpool]], in 1949. The team also reached the quarter-final stage of the [[1964 European Nations' Cup]], where they lost to the eventual champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]].\n\nUnder the guidance of [[Jack Charlton]], the team enjoyed its most successful era, reaching their highest [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA world ranking]] ever at sixth in August 1993, and qualifying for [[UEFA Euro 1988]] in their first appearance at the [[UEFA European Championship]], reaching the quarter-finals of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in their first ever appearance at the finals, as well as making the last 16 at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 edition]]. Charlton's successor [[Mick McCarthy]] lost out on the next two major tournaments but ultimately qualified for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], making it to the last 16. Under [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], the team narrowly lost out on qualification for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] World Cup during a [[2009 Republic of Ireland v France football matches|controversial play-off]], but went on to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]].\n\nThe team failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] in Brazil, marking the end of Trapattoni's tenure as manager. The Republic of Ireland also fell to a record low FIFA ranking of 59th, then a record low of 70th in June 2014.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/index.html FIFA Rankings] FIFA.

''The Boys in Green'' reached the Round of 16 stage at that tournament and were knocked out by the hosts and eventual runners-up [[France national football team|France]] after losing 2\u20131.\n\n==History==\n\n===Irish Free State (1924\u20131936)===\nBetween 1882 and 1924, Ireland was represented by [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|a single national football team]] organised by the [[Belfast]]-based [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA). In 1920, Ireland [[Partition of Ireland|was partitioned]] into [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Irish Free State]] (the latter in turn becoming [[\u00c9ire]] or Ireland after adopting [[Constitution of Ireland|a new Constitution]] in 1937, followed by [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|declaring itself a republic]] in 1949.) Following the initial political upheavals surrounding Partition, a [[Dublin]]-based organisation calling itself the Football Association of the Irish Free State (FAIFS) split from the IFA in 1921 and began organising [[League of Ireland|its own league]] and national football team.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Football Association of Ireland: 75 years | first=Peter | last=Byrne | year=1996 | location=Dublin | publisher=Sportsworld | isbn = 1-900110-06-7 | page=22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, the FAIFS was recognised by [[FIFA]] as the governing body of football in the Irish Free State<ref>{{cite book|title=Football Association of Ireland: 75 years|first=Peter|last=Byrne|year=1996|location=Dublin|publisher=Sportsworld|isbn=1-900110-06-7|page=22}}</ref> and at the [[Ireland at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Summer Olympics]], the Irish Free State made their international debut.

In subsequent years, the status of the Olympic Games football competition was downgraded and as a result, this game is widely regarded as the Irish Free State's first official game. On 25 February 1934, the Irish Free State made their [[FIFA World Cup]] debut, drawing 4\u20134 with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at Dalymount Park in a [[1934 FIFA World Cup qualification|1934 FIFA World Cup qualifier]].

During this entire period, there were two Irish international football teams, chosen by two rival Associations. Both Associations, the Northern Ireland-based IFA and the Irish Free State-based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and considered themselves entitled to select players from the entire island. At least 38 [[Dual Irish international footballers|dual internationals]] were selected to represent both teams,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nifootball.blogspot.com/2006/10/dual-internationalists.html|title=List of Dual Internationalists|publisher=Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats|first=Jonny|last=Dewart|date=23 October 2006}}</ref> however the overwhelming majority of these were Southerners who also agreed to play for the IFA team, with only a bare handful \"crossing the border\" in the other direction.\n\nA [[England v Ireland (1949)|2\u20130 win]] over [[England national football team|England]] at [[Goodison Park]] on 21 September 1949 was the first time England suffered a home defeat by a team outside the [[Home Nations|Home Countries]] of [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|Ireland]] team run by the Belfast-based [[Irish Football Association|Irish FA]]. FIFA eventually intervened when both teams entered [[1950 FIFA World Cup qualification|1950 World Cup qualification]], the first time they had entered the same competition. Four players \u2013 [[Tom Aherne]], [[Reg Ryan]], [[Davy Walsh]], [[Con Martin]] \u2013 actually played for the two different teams in the same FIFA World Cup tournament.<ref>Ryan, op. cit. pg 59.</ref> All four players concerned had been born in the Irish Free State and made their full international debut in FAI colours before agreeing to represent the IFA team. This may have alarmed the FAI, since they subsequently lobbied FIFA to prevent the IFA from picking Southern-born players (as well as attempting to exert pressure on the players themselves, sometimes through their clubs). FIFA's response was to restrict the eligibility of players on the basis of the (political) border, further ruling in 1953 that neither team could be referred to as ''Ireland'' in competitions which both teams were eligible to enter; i.e., initially the FIFA World Cup and subsequently the European Nations Cup (now the UEFA European Football Championship). FIFA decreed that the FAI team officially be called the ''Republic of Ireland'' while the IFA team was to be named [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].<ref>Byrne, op. cit., pg 68.</ref>\n\n===Republic of Ireland (1953\u20131968)===\nIn 1953, FIFA renamed the team from \"Ireland\" to \"Republic of Ireland\". The [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] qualifiers saw the Republic of Ireland drawn with England. In their home game against England, [[Alf Ringstead]] put the hosts 1\u20130 up before [[John Atyeo]] equalised in the last minute to salvage a 1\u20131 draw for England. Under the rules of the day, a win for the Republic of Ireland would have meant a play-off with England for a place in the World Cup.<ref name=\"soccer-ireland.com\" />\n\nAfter reaching the quarter-finals of the [[1964 European Nations' Cup]], the Republic of Ireland were drawn to face [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and [[Syria national football team|Syria]] in [[1966 FIFA World Cup qualification|1966 World Cup qualifying]]. Despite Syria's withdrawal, this was still considered a qualifying group with the Irish winning 1\u20130 at home and losing 4\u20131 away.

This was the first instance of a player born outside the Republic being selected to play for the national team due to having an Irish parent. Since then, many of the Republic's most prominent players have been born in England, including [[Mark Lawrenson]], [[David O'Leary]], [[John Aldridge]], [[Tony Cascarino]] and [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]].

His replacement, [[Liam Tuohy (footballer)|Liam Tuohy]], did a somewhat better in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification|1974 qualification]], and more importantly oversaw major improvements to the national team's training facilities and persuaded many English club sides to end their policies of not releasing Irish players for international games during the domestic season.

The Republic of Ireland have also played home matches in [[Tolka Park]] (twice) and the [[RDS Arena]] in Dublin as well at the [[Mardyke]] and [[Flower Lodge]] grounds in Cork. These games in Cork were, until 2009, the only two home Irish internationals played outside of Dublin. During the construction of the [[Aviva Stadium]], two friendly games were played in [[Thomond Park]], [[Limerick]], in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.ie/breakingnews/sport/trap-aussies-gave-us-a-severe-lesson-422438.html|title=Trap: Aussies gave us 'a severe lesson'|date=13 August 2009|accessdate=13 August 2009|work=Irish Examiner}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0908/live_ireland_southafrica.html|title=Rep of Ireland 1\u20130 South Africa \u2013 Matchtracker|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=8 September 2009|publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport|first=Ed|last=Leahy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909220720/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0908/live_ireland_southafrica.html|archivedate=9 September 2009}}</ref> Two further friendlies were played in the RDS Arena in May 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/irish/8701396.stm|title=Republic of Ireland 2\u20131 Paraguay|date=25 May 2010|accessdate=25 May 2010|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/algeria/7779724/Republic-of-Ireland-3-Algeria-0-match-report.html|first=Mark|last=Ogden|title=Republic of Ireland 3 Algeria 0 : match report|date=28 May 2010|accessdate=28 May 2010|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> Ireland played a friendly against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] in Cork's 7,000 capacity [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]] stadium in May 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/euro-2016/euro-2016-teams/republic-of-ireland/irelands-euro-2016-warmup-ends-with-a-whimper-as-belarus-win-in-cork-34762798.html|title=Ireland's Euro 2016 warm-up ends with a whimper as Belarus win in Cork|first=Miguel|last=Delaney|work=Irish Independent|date=31 May 2016|accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Media coverage===\nIreland matches currently broadcast by [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann]] (RT\u00c9) (qualifiers only), [[Sky Sports]], and highlights on [[Virgin Media Television (Ireland)|Virgin Media Television]].

Rocket engines are [[reaction engine]]s, producing thrust by ejecting mass rearward, in accordance with [[Newton's third law]]. Most rocket engines use the [[combustion]] of reactive chemicals to supply the necessary energy, but non-combusting forms such as [[cold gas thruster]]s and [[nuclear thermal rocket]]s also exist.

The hot exhaust is choked at the throat, which, among other things, dictates the amount of thrust produced.<br />\n5. Exhaust exits the rocket.]]\nRocket engines produce thrust by the expulsion of an exhaust [[fluid]] that has been accelerated to high speed through a [[propelling nozzle]]. The fluid is usually a gas created by high pressure ({{convert|10|to|300|bar|psi|order=flip|adj=on}}) combustion of solid or liquid [[Rocket propellant|propellants]], consisting of [[fuel]] and [[oxidizing agent|oxidiser]] components, within a [[combustion chamber]]. As the gases expand through the nozzle, they are accelerated to very high ([[supersonic]]) speed, and the reaction to this pushes the engine in the opposite direction. Combustion is most frequently used for practical rockets, as high temperatures and pressures are desirable for the best performance.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nA [[model rocket]]ry alternative to combustion is the [[water rocket]], which uses water pressurized by compressed air, [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrogen]], or any other readily available, inert gas.\n\n===Propellant===\nRocket propellant is mass that is stored, usually in some form of propellant tank, or within the combustion chamber itself, prior to being ejected from a rocket engine in the form of a fluid jet to produce thrust.\n\nChemical rocket propellants are most commonly used, which undergo exothermic chemical reactions which produce hot gas which is used by a rocket for propulsive purposes. Alternatively, a chemically inert [[reaction mass]] can be heated using a high-energy power source via a heat exchanger, and then no combustion chamber is used.\n\n[[Solid rocket]] propellants are prepared as a mixture of fuel and oxidising components called 'grain' and the propellant storage casing effectively becomes the combustion chamber.\n\n===Injection===\n[[Liquid rocket|Liquid-fuelled rockets]] force separate fuel and oxidiser components into the combustion chamber, where they mix and burn. [[Hybrid rocket]] engines use a combination of solid and liquid or gaseous propellants. Both liquid and hybrid rockets use ''[[Liquid-fuel rocket#Injectors|injectors]]'' to introduce the propellant into the chamber. These are often an array of simple [[jet (nozzle)|jet]]s \u2013 holes through which the propellant escapes under pressure; but sometimes may be more complex spray nozzles. When two or more propellants are injected, the jets usually deliberately cause the propellants to collide as this breaks up the flow into smaller droplets that burn more easily.\n\n===Combustion chamber===\nFor chemical rockets the combustion chamber is typically cylindrical, and [[flame holder]]s are not used.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The dimensions of the cylinder are such that the propellant is able to combust thoroughly; different [[rocket propellant]]s require different combustion chamber sizes for this to occur.\n\nThis leads to a number called <math>L^*</math>:{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n:<math>L^* = \\frac {V_c} {A_t}</math>\nwhere:\n*<math>V_c</math> is the volume of the chamber\n*<math>A_t</math> is the area of the throat of the nozzle.\nL* is typically in the range of {{convert|25|-|60|in|m}}.\n\nThe combination of temperatures and pressures typically reached in a combustion chamber is usually extreme by any standard. Unlike in [[airbreathing jet engine]]s, no atmospheric nitrogen is present to dilute and cool the combustion, and the propellant mixture can reach true [[stoichiometric]] ratios. This, in combination with the high pressures, means that the rate of heat conduction through the walls is very high.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn order for fuel and oxidizer to flow into the chamber, the pressure of the propellant fluids entering the combustion chamber must exceed the pressure inside the combustion chamber itself.  This may be accomplished by a variety of design approaches including [[turbopump]]s or, in simpler engines, via [[Pressure-fed cycle (rocket)|sufficient tank pressure]] to advance fluid flow. Tank pressure may be maintained by several means, including a high-pressure [[helium]] pressurization system common to many large rocket engines or, in some newer rocket systems, by a bleed-off of high-pressure gas from the engine cycle to [[autogenous pressurization|autogenously pressurize]] the propellant tanks<ref name=nsf20160927>\n{{cite news |last=Bergin|first=Chris |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/09/spacex-reveals-mars-game-changer-colonization-plan/ |title=SpaceX reveals ITS Mars game changer via colonization plan |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2016-09-27 |accessdate=2016-09-27 }}</ref><ref name=sfi20160927/>  For example, the self-pressurization gas system of the [[SpaceX Starship]] is a critical part of SpaceX strategy to reduce launch vehicle fluids from five in their legacy Falcon 9 vehicle family to just two in Starship, eliminating not only the helium tank pressurant but all [[hypergolic propellant]]s as well as [[nitrogen]] for cold-gas [[reaction control system|reaction-control thrusters]].<ref name=nsf20161003/>\n\n===Nozzle===\n{{Main|Rocket engine nozzle}}\n[[File:Rocket thrust.svg|thumb|right|Rocket thrust is caused by pressures acting in the combustion chamber and nozzle. From Newton's third law, equal and opposite pressures act on the exhaust, and this accelerates it to high speeds.]]\nThe hot gas produced in the combustion chamber is permitted to escape through an opening (the \"throat\"), and then through a diverging expansion section. When sufficient pressure is provided to the nozzle (about 2.5-3 times ambient pressure), the nozzle ''[[choked flow|choke]]s'' and a supersonic jet is formed, dramatically accelerating the gas, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speeds vary, depending on the expansion ratio the nozzle is designed for, but exhaust speeds as high as ten times the [[speed of sound]] in air at sea level are not uncommon. About half of the rocket engine's thrust comes from the unbalanced pressures inside the combustion chamber, and the rest comes from the pressures acting against the inside of the nozzle (see diagram). As the gas expands ([[Adiabatic process|adiabatically]]) the pressure against the nozzle's walls forces the rocket engine in one direction while accelerating the gas in the other.\n\n{{Anchor|opt_expansion}} <!-- add anchor for diagram references --->\n[[File:Rocket nozzle expansion.svg|thumb|right|upright|The four expansion regimes of a de Laval nozzle:<br />\n\u2022 under-expanded<br />\n\u2022 perfectly expanded<br />\n\u2022 over-expanded<br />\n\u2022 grossly over-expanded]]\nThe most commonly used nozzle is the [[de Laval nozzle]], a fixed geometry nozzle with a high expansion-ratio. The large bell- or cone-shaped nozzle extension beyond the throat gives the rocket engine its characteristic shape.\n\nThe exit [[static pressure#Static pressure in fluid dynamics|static pressure]] of the exhaust jet depends on the chamber pressure and the ratio of exit to throat area of the nozzle. As exit pressure varies from the ambient (atmospheric) pressure, a choked nozzle is said to be\n* '''under-expanded''' (exit pressure greater than ambient),\n* '''perfectly expanded''' (exit pressure equals ambient),\n* '''over-expanded''' (exit pressure less than ambient; [[shock diamond]]s form outside the nozzle), or\n* '''grossly over-expanded''' (a [[shock wave]] forms inside the nozzle extension).\n\nIn practice, perfect expansion is only achievable with a variable-exit area nozzle (since ambient pressure decreases as altitude increases), and is not possible above a certain altitude as ambient pressure approaches zero. If the nozzle is not perfectly expanded, then loss of efficiency occurs. Grossly over-expanded nozzles lose less efficiency, but can cause mechanical problems with the nozzle. Fixed-area nozzles become progressively more under-expanded as they gain altitude. Almost all de Laval nozzles will be momentarily grossly over-expanded during startup in an atmosphere.<ref>Dexter K Huzel and David H. Huang (1971), [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710019929_1971019929.pdf NASA SP-125, Design of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines] &nbsp;Second edition of a technical report obtained from the website of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</ref>\n\nNozzle efficiency is affected by operation in the atmosphere because atmospheric pressure changes with altitude; but due to the supersonic speeds of the gas exiting from a rocket engine, the pressure of the jet may be either below or above ambient, and equilibrium between the two is not reached at all altitudes (see diagram).\n\n====Back pressure and optimal expansion====\nFor optimal performance, the pressure of the gas at the end of the nozzle should just equal the ambient pressure: if the exhaust's pressure is lower than the ambient pressure, then the vehicle will be slowed by the difference in pressure between the top of the engine and the exit; on the other hand, if the exhaust's pressure is higher, then exhaust pressure that could have been converted into thrust is not converted, and energy is wasted.\n\nTo maintain this ideal of equality between the exhaust's exit pressure and the ambient pressure, the diameter of the nozzle would need to increase with altitude, giving the pressure a longer nozzle to act on (and reducing the exit pressure and temperature). This increase is difficult to arrange in a lightweight fashion, although is routinely done with other forms of jet engines. In rocketry a lightweight compromise nozzle is generally used and some reduction in atmospheric performance occurs when used at other than the 'design altitude' or when throttled. To improve on this, various exotic nozzle designs such as the [[plug nozzle]], [[stepped nozzles]], the [[expanding nozzle]] and the [[aerospike engine|aerospike]] have been proposed, each providing some way to adapt to changing ambient air pressure and each allowing the gas to expand further against the nozzle, giving extra thrust at higher altitudes.\n\nWhen exhausting into a sufficiently low ambient pressure (vacuum) several issues arise. One is the sheer weight of the nozzle\u2014beyond a certain point, for a particular vehicle, the extra weight of the nozzle outweighs any performance gained. Secondly, as the exhaust gases adiabatically expand within the nozzle they cool, and eventually some of the chemicals can freeze, producing 'snow' within the jet. This causes instabilities in the jet and must be avoided.\n\nOn a [[de Laval nozzle]], exhaust gas flow detachment will occur in a grossly over-expanded nozzle.  As the detachment point will not be uniform around the axis of the engine, a side force may be imparted to the engine. This side force may change over time and result in control problems with the launch vehicle.\n\nAdvanced [[altitude compensating nozzle|altitude-compensating]] designs, such as the [[aerospike engine|aerospike]] or [[plug nozzle]], attempt to minimize performance losses by adjusting to varying expansion ratio caused by changing altitude.\n\n===Propellant efficiency===\n{{see also|Specific impulse}}\n[[Image:Nozzle de Laval diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright|Typical temperature (T), pressure (p), and velocity (v) profiles in a de Laval Nozzle]]\nFor a rocket engine to be propellant efficient, it is important that the maximum pressures possible be created on the walls of the chamber and nozzle by a specific amount of propellant; as this is the source of the thrust. This can be achieved by all of:\n\n*heating the propellant to as high a temperature as possible (using a high energy fuel, containing hydrogen and carbon and sometimes metals such as [[aluminium]], or even using nuclear energy)\n*using a low specific density gas (as hydrogen rich as possible)\n*using propellants which are, or decompose to, simple molecules with few degrees of freedom to maximise translational velocity\n\nSince all of these things minimise the mass of the propellant used, and since pressure is proportional to the mass of propellant present to be accelerated as it pushes on the engine, and since from [[Newton's third law]] the pressure that acts on the engine also reciprocally acts on the propellant, it turns out that for any given engine, the speed that the propellant leaves the chamber is unaffected by the chamber pressure (although the thrust is proportional). However, speed is significantly affected by all three of the above factors and the exhaust speed is an excellent measure of the engine propellant efficiency. This is termed ''exhaust velocity'', and after allowance is made for factors that can reduce it, the '''[[effective exhaust velocity]]''' is one of the most important parameters of a rocket engine (although weight, cost, ease of manufacture etc. are usually also very important).\n\nFor aerodynamic reasons the flow goes sonic (\"[[Choked flow|chokes]]\") at the narrowest part of the nozzle, the 'throat'. Since the [[speed of sound]] in gases increases with the square root of temperature, the use of hot exhaust gas greatly improves performance. By comparison, at room temperature the speed of sound in air is about 340&nbsp;m/s while the speed of sound in the hot gas of a rocket engine can be over 1700&nbsp;m/s; much of this performance is due to the higher temperature, but additionally rocket propellants are chosen to be of low molecular mass, and this also gives a higher velocity compared to air.\n\nExpansion in the rocket nozzle then further multiplies the speed, typically between 1.5 and 2 times, giving a highly [[collimated]] hypersonic exhaust jet. The speed increase of a rocket nozzle is mostly determined by its area expansion ratio\u2014the ratio of the area of the throat to the area at the exit, but detailed properties of the gas are also important. Larger ratio nozzles are more massive but are able to extract more heat from the combustion gases, increasing the exhaust velocity.\n\n===Thrust vectoring===\n{{main|Thrust vectoring}}\nVehicles typically require the overall thrust to change direction over the length of the burn. A number of different ways to achieve this have been flown:\n\n*The entire engine is mounted on a [[hinge]] or [[gimbal]] and any propellant feeds reach the engine via low pressure flexible pipes or rotary couplings.\n*Just the combustion chamber and nozzle is gimballed, the pumps are fixed, and high pressure feeds attach to the engine.\n*Multiple engines (often canted at slight angles) are deployed but throttled to give the overall vector that is required, giving only a very small penalty.\n*High-temperature vanes protrude into the exhaust and can be tilted to deflect the jet.\n\n==Overall performance==\nRocket technology can combine very high thrust ([[meganewton]]s), very high exhaust speeds (around 10 times the speed of sound in air at sea level) and very high thrust/weight ratios (>100) ''simultaneously'' as well as being able to operate outside the atmosphere, and while permitting the use of low pressure and hence lightweight tanks and structure.\n\nRockets can be further optimised to even more extreme performance along one or more of these axes at the expense of the others.\n\n===Specific impulse===\n{{Specific impulse|align=right}}\n{{Main|Specific impulse}}\n\nThe most important metric for the efficiency of a rocket engine is [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] per unit of [[propellant]], this is called [[specific impulse]] (usually written <math>I_{sp}</math>). This is either measured as a speed (the ''effective exhaust velocity'' <math>v_{e}</math> in metres/second or ft/s) or as a time (seconds). For example, if an engine producing 100 pounds of thrust runs for 320 seconds and burns 100 pounds of propellant, then the specific impulse is 320 seconds. The higher the specific impulse, the less propellant is required to provide the desired impulse.\n\nThe specific impulse that can be achieved is primarily a function of the propellant mix (and ultimately would limit the specific impulse), but practical limits on chamber pressures and the nozzle expansion ratios reduce the performance that can be achieved.\n\n===Net thrust===\n{{main|Thrust}}\nBelow is an approximate equation for calculating the net thrust of a rocket engine:<ref>{{cite book|author=George P. Sutton|author2=Oscar Biblarz|last-author-amp=yes|title=Rocket Propulsion Elements|edition=7th|publisher=Wiley Interscience|date=2001|ISBN=0-471-32642-9}} See Equation 2-14.</ref>\n\n:<math>F_n = \\dot{m}\\;v_{e} = \\dot{m}\\;v_{e-opt} + A_{e}(p_{e} - p_{amb})</math>\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=right|where:\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=right|<math>\\dot{m}</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; exhaust gas mass flow\n|- \n!align=right|<math>v_{e}</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; effective exhaust velocity\n|-\n!align=right|<math>v_{e-opt}</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; effective jet velocity when Pamb = Pe\n|-\n!align=right|<math>A_{e}</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; flow area at nozzle exit plane (or the plane where the jet leaves the nozzle if separated flow)\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_{e}</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; static pressure at nozzle exit plane\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_{amb}</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; ambient (or atmospheric) pressure\n|}\n\nSince, unlike a jet engine, a conventional rocket motor lacks an air intake, there is no 'ram drag' to deduct from the gross thrust. Consequently, the net thrust of a rocket motor is equal to the gross thrust (apart from static back pressure).\n\nThe <math>\\dot{m}\\;v_{e-opt}\\,</math> term represents the momentum thrust, which remains constant at a given throttle setting, whereas the <math>A_{e}(p_{e} - p_{amb})\\,</math> term represents the pressure thrust term. At full throttle, the net thrust of a rocket motor improves slightly with increasing altitude, because as atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, the pressure thrust term increases. At the surface of the Earth the pressure thrust may be reduced by up to 30%, depending on the engine design. This reduction drops roughly exponentially to zero with increasing altitude.\n\nMaximum efficiency for a rocket engine is achieved by maximising the momentum contribution of the equation without incurring penalties from over expanding the exhaust. This occurs when <math>p_{e} = p_{amb}</math>. Since ambient pressure changes with altitude, most rocket engines spend very little time operating at peak efficiency.\n\nSince specific impulse is force divided by the rate of mass flow, this equation means that the specific impulse varies with altitude.\n\n===Vacuum specific impulse, I<sub>sp</sub>===\n\nDue to the specific impulse varying with pressure, a quantity that is easy to compare and calculate with is useful. Because rockets [[choked flow|choke]] at the throat, and because the supersonic exhaust prevents external pressure influences travelling upstream, it turns out that the pressure at the exit is ideally exactly proportional to the propellant flow <math> \\dot{m}</math>, provided the mixture ratios and combustion efficiencies are maintained.

In liquid and hybrid rockets, the propellant flow entering the chamber is controlled using valves, in [[solid rocket]]s it is controlled by changing the area of propellant that is burning and this can be designed into the propellant grain (and hence cannot be controlled in real-time).\n\nRockets can usually be throttled down to an exit pressure of about one-third of ambient pressure<ref name=Sutton/> (often limited by flow separation in nozzles) and up to a maximum limit determined only by the mechanical strength of the engine.\n\nIn practice, the degree to which rockets can be throttled varies greatly, but most rockets can be throttled by a factor of 2 without great difficulty;<ref name=Sutton/> the typical limitation is combustion stability, as for example, injectors need a minimum pressure to avoid triggering damaging oscillations (chugging or combustion instabilities); but injectors can be optimised and tested for wider ranges.\nFor example, some more recent liquid-propellant engine designs that have been optimised for greater throttling capability ([[BE-3]], [[Raptor (rocket engine)|Raptor]]) can be throttled to as low as 18\u201320 percent of rated thrust.<!-- eg, Blue Orgin BE-3 --><ref name=sn20150407>\n{{cite news |last1=Foust|first=Jeff |title=Blue Origin Completes BE-3 Engine as BE-4 Work Continues |url=http://spacenews.com/blue-origin-completes-be-3-engine-as-be-4-work-continues/ |accessdate=2016-10-20 |work=Space News |date=2015-04-07 }}</ref><!-- eg, SpaceX Raptor --><ref name=sfi20160927>\n{{cite news |url= http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/space-exploration-technologies/elon-musk-shows-off-interplanetary-transport-system/ |title= Elon Musk Shows Off Interplanetary Transport System |publisher= Spaceflight Insider |last=Richardson|first=Derek |date=2016-09-27 |accessdate=2016-10-20 }}</ref>\nSolid rockets can be throttled by using shaped grains that will vary their surface area over the course of the burn.<ref name=Sutton/>\n\n===Energy efficiency===\n{{further|Rocket#Energy efficiency}}\n[[File:Rocket propulsion efficiency.svg|thumb|Rocket vehicle mechanical efficiency as a function of vehicle instantaneous speed divided by effective exhaust speed. These percentages need to be multiplied by internal engine efficiency to get overall efficiency.]]\nRocket engine nozzles are surprisingly efficient [[heat engines]] for generating a high speed jet, as a consequence of the high combustion temperature and high [[compression ratio]]. Rocket nozzles give an excellent approximation to [[adiabatic expansion]] which is a reversible process, and hence they give efficiencies which are very close to that of the [[Carnot cycle]]. Given the temperatures reached, over 60% efficiency can be achieved with chemical rockets.\n\nFor a ''vehicle'' employing a rocket engine the energetic efficiency is very good if the vehicle speed approaches or somewhat exceeds the exhaust velocity (relative to launch); but at low speeds the energy efficiency goes to 0% at zero speed (as with all [[jet propulsion]].) <!--- it's very counterintuitive, a way to look at it is that energy= force x distance, but at zero speed you have no movement and you lose lots of energy in the jet --->See [[Rocket#Energy efficiency|Rocket energy efficiency]] for more details.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Thrust-to-weight ratio===\n{{Main|thrust-to-weight ratio}}\nRockets, of all the jet engines, indeed of essentially all engines, have the highest thrust to weight ratio. This is especially true for liquid rocket engines.\n\nThis high performance is due to the small volume of [[pressure vessel]]s that make up the engine\u2014the pumps, pipes and combustion chambers involved. The lack of inlet duct and the use of dense liquid propellant allows the pressurisation system to be small and lightweight, whereas duct engines have to deal with air which has around three orders of magnitude lower density.\n\n{{Engine thrust to weight table}}\n\nOf the liquid propellants used, density is lowest for [[liquid hydrogen]]. Although this propellant has the highest [[specific impulse]], its very low density (about one fourteenth that of water) requires larger and heavier turbopumps and pipework, which decreases the engine's thrust-to-weight ratio (for example the RS-25) compared to those that do not (NK-33).\n\n==Cooling==\nFor efficiency reasons, higher temperatures are desirable, but materials lose their strength if the temperature becomes too high. Rockets run with combustion temperatures that can reach ~3,500 K (~3,200&nbsp;\u00b0C or ~5,800&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nMost other jet engines have gas turbines in the hot exhaust. Due to their larger surface area, they are harder to cool and hence there is a need to run the combustion processes at much lower temperatures, losing efficiency. In addition, [[wiktionary:duct engine|duct engines]] use air as an oxidant, which contains 78% largely unreactive nitrogen, which dilutes the reaction and lowers the temperatures.<ref name=Sutton/> Rockets have none of these inherent combustion temperature limiters.\n\nThe temperatures reached by rocket exhaust often substantially exceed the melting points of the nozzle and combustion chamber materials (~1,200 K for copper). Most construction materials will also combust if exposed to high temperature oxidizer, which leads to a number of design challenges. The nozzle and combustion temperature walls must not be allowed to combust, melt, or vaporize (sometimes facetiously termed an \"engine-rich exhaust\").\n\nRockets that use the common construction materials such as aluminium, steel, nickel or copper alloys must employ cooling systems to limit the temperatures that engine structures experience. [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|Regenerative cooling]], where the propellant is passed through tubes around the combustion chamber or nozzle, and other techniques, such as curtain cooling or film cooling, are employed to give longer nozzle and chamber life. These techniques ensure that a gaseous thermal [[boundary layer]] touching the material is kept below the temperature which would cause the material to catastrophically fail.\n\nTwo material exceptions that can directly sustain rocket exhaust temperatures are [[graphite]] and [[tungsten]], although both are subject to oxidation if not protected. Materials technology, combined with the engine design, is a limiting factor of the exhaust temperature of chemical rockets.\n\nIn rockets, the heat fluxes that can pass through the wall are among the highest in engineering; fluxes are generally in the range of 1-200 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. The strongest heat fluxes are found at the throat, which often sees twice that found in the associated chamber and nozzle. This is due to the combination of high speeds (which gives a very thin boundary layer), and although lower than the chamber, the high temperatures seen there. (See [[#Rocket nozzles|rocket nozzles]] above for temperatures in nozzle).\n\nIn rockets the coolant methods include:\n\n#uncooled (used for short runs mainly during testing)\n#[[ablation|ablative]] walls (walls are lined with a material that is continuously vaporised and carried away).\n#[[radiative cooling]] (the chamber becomes almost white hot and radiates the heat away)\n#dump cooling (a propellant, usually [[hydrogen]], is passed around the chamber and dumped)\n#[[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] ([[liquid rocket]]s use the fuel, or occasionally the oxidiser, to cool the chamber via a cooling jacket before being injected)\n#curtain cooling (propellant injection is arranged so the temperature of the gases is cooler at the walls)\n#film cooling (surfaces are wetted with liquid propellant, which cools as it evaporates)\n\nIn all cases the cooling effect that prevents the wall from being destroyed is caused by a thin layer of insulating fluid (a [[boundary layer]]) that is in contact with the walls that is far cooler than the combustion temperature. Provided this boundary layer is intact the wall will not be damaged.\n\nDisruption of the boundary layer may occur during cooling failures or combustion instabilities, and wall failure typically occurs soon after.\n\nWith regenerative cooling a second boundary layer is found in the coolant channels around the chamber. This boundary layer thickness needs to be as small as possible, since the boundary layer acts as an insulator between the wall and the coolant. This may be achieved by making the coolant [[velocity]] in the channels as high as possible.\n\nIn practice, regenerative cooling is nearly always used in conjunction with curtain cooling and/or film cooling.\n\nLiquid-fuelled engines are often run [[Air-fuel ratio|fuel-rich]], which lowers combustion temperatures.  This reduces heat loads on the engine and allows lower cost materials and a simplified cooling system. This can also ''increase'' performance by lowering the average molecular weight of the exhaust and increasing the efficiency with which combustion heat is converted to kinetic exhaust energy.\n\n==Mechanical issues==\nRocket combustion chambers are normally operated at fairly high pressure, typically 10\u2013200{{nbsp}}bar (1\u201320{{nbsp}}MPa, 150\u20133,000{{nbsp}}psi). When operated within significant atmospheric pressure, higher combustion chamber pressures give better performance by permitting a larger and more efficient nozzle to be fitted without it being grossly overexpanded.\n\nHowever, these high pressures cause the outermost part of the chamber to be under very large [[hoop stress]]es \u2013 rocket engines are [[pressure vessel]]s.\n\nWorse, due to the high temperatures created in rocket engines the materials used tend to have a significantly lowered working tensile strength.\n\nIn addition, significant temperature gradients are set up in the walls of the chamber and nozzle, these cause differential expansion of the inner liner that create [[internal stresses]].\n\n==Acoustic issues==\nThe extreme vibration and acoustic environment inside a rocket motor commonly result in peak stresses well above mean values, especially in the presence of [[organ pipe]]-like resonances and gas turbulence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/414364/whats-the-deal-with-rocket-vibrations/|title=What's the Deal with Rocket Vibrations?|last=Sauser|first=Brittany|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Combustion instabilities===\nThe combustion may display undesired instabilities, of sudden or periodic nature. The pressure in the injection chamber may increase until the propellant flow through the injector plate decreases; a moment later the pressure drops and the flow increases, injecting more propellant in the combustion chamber which burns a moment later, and again increases the chamber pressure, repeating the cycle. This may lead to high-amplitude pressure oscillations, often in ultrasonic range, which may damage the motor. Oscillations of \u00b1200&nbsp;psi at 25&nbsp;kHz were the cause of failures of early versions of the [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] missile second stage engines. The other failure mode is a [[deflagration to detonation transition]]; the supersonic [[Longitudinal wave|pressure wave]] formed in the combustion chamber may destroy the engine.<ref name=\"titan2\">{{cite book|author=David K. Stumpf|title=Titian II: A History of a Cold War Missile Program|edition=|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|date=2000|ISBN=1-55728-601-9}}</ref>\n\nCombustion instability was also a problem during [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]] development. The Rocketdyne engines used in the Atlas family were found to suffer from this effect in several static firing tests, and three missile launches exploded on the pad due to rough combustion in the booster engines. In most cases, it occurred while attempting to start the engines with a \"dry start\" method whereby the igniter mechanism would be activated prior to propellant injection. During the process of man-rating Atlas for [[Project Mercury]], solving combustion instability was a high priority, and the final two Mercury flights sported an upgraded propulsion system with baffled injectors and a hypergolic igniter.\n\nThe problem affecting Atlas vehicles was mainly the so-called \"racetrack\" phenomenon, where burning propellant would swirl around in a circle at faster and faster speeds, eventually producing vibration strong enough to rupture the engine, leading to complete destruction of the rocket. It was eventually solved by adding several baffles around the injector face to break up swirling propellant.\n\nMore significantly, combustion instability was a problem with the Saturn F-1 engines. Some of the early units tested exploded during static firing, which led to the addition of injector baffles.\n\nIn the Soviet space program, combustion instability also proved a problem on some rocket engines, including the RD-107 engine used in the R-7 family and the RD-216 used in the R-14 family, and several failures of these vehicles occurred before the problem was solved. Soviet engineering and manufacturing processes never satisfactorily resolved combustion instability in larger RP-1/LOX engines, so the RD-171 engine used to power the Zenit family still used four smaller thrust chambers fed by a common engine mechanism.\n\nThe combustion instabilities can be provoked by remains of cleaning solvents in the engine (e.g. the first attempted launch of a Titan II in 1962), reflected shock wave, initial instability after ignition, explosion near the nozzle that reflects into the combustion chamber, and many more factors. In stable engine designs the oscillations are quickly suppressed; in unstable designs they persist for prolonged periods. Oscillation suppressors are commonly used.\n\nPeriodic variations of thrust, caused by combustion instability or longitudinal vibrations of structures between the tanks and the engines which modulate the propellant flow, are known as \"[[pogo oscillation]]s\" or \"pogo\", named after the [[pogo stick]].\n\nThree different types of combustion instabilities occur:\n\n====Chugging====\nThis is a low frequency oscillation at a few Hertz in chamber pressure usually caused by pressure variations in feed lines due to variations in acceleration of the vehicle.<ref name=sutton1975/>{{rp|261}} \nThis can cause cyclic variation in thrust, and the effects can vary from merely annoying to actually damaging the payload or vehicle. Chugging can be minimised by using gas-filled damping tubes on feed lines of high density propellants.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n====Buzzing====\nThis can be caused due to insufficient pressure drop across the injectors.<ref name=sutton1975/>{{rp|261}} \nIt generally is mostly annoying, rather than being damaging. However, in extreme cases combustion can end up being forced backwards through the injectors \u2013 this can cause explosions with monopropellants.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n====Screeching====\nThis is the most immediately damaging, and the hardest to control. It is due to acoustics within the combustion chamber that often couples to the chemical combustion processes that are the primary drivers of the energy release, and can lead to unstable resonant \"screeching\" that commonly leads to catastrophic failure due to thinning of the insulating thermal boundary layer. Acoustic oscillations can be excited by thermal processes, such as the flow of hot air through a pipe or combustion in a chamber. Specifically, standing acoustic waves inside a chamber can be intensified if combustion occurs more intensely in regions where the pressure of the acoustic wave is maximal.<ref name=strutt1896>\n{{cite book|author=John W.

As the [[hypersonic]] exhaust mixes with the ambient air, [[shock wave]]s are formed. The [[Space Shuttle]] generates over 200 [[dB(A)]] of noise around its base. To reduce this, and the risk of payload damage or injury to the crew atop the stack, the [[mobile launcher platform]] was fitted with a [[Sound Suppression System]] that sprayed {{convert|1.1|e6L|USgal}} of water around the base of the rocket in 41 seconds at launch time. Using this system kept sound levels within the payload bay to 142&nbsp;dB <ref>{{Cite web\n  |title=Sound Suppression System\n  |publisher=NASA\n  |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/sound-suppression-system.html\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[sound intensity]] from the shock waves generated depends on the size of the rocket and on the exhaust velocity. Such shock waves seem to account for the characteristic crackling and popping sounds produced by large rocket engines when heard live. These noise peaks typically overload microphones and audio electronics, and so are generally weakened or entirely absent in recorded or broadcast audio reproductions. For large rockets at close range, the acoustic effects could actually kill.<ref name=\"CR566\">R.C. Potter and M.J. Crocker (1966). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660030602_1966030602.pdf NASA CR-566, Acoustic Prediction Methods For Rocket Engines, Including The Effects Of Clustered Engines And Deflected Flow] From website of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Langley (NASA Langley)</ref>\n\nMore worryingly for space agencies, such sound levels can also damage the launch structure, or worse, be reflected back at the comparatively delicate rocket above. This is why so much water is typically used at launches. The water spray changes the acoustic qualities of the air and reduces or deflects the sound energy away from the rocket.\n\nGenerally speaking, noise is most intense when a rocket is close to the ground, since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the jet, as well as reflecting off the ground. Also, when the vehicle is moving slowly, little of the chemical energy input to the engine can go into increasing the kinetic energy of the rocket (since useful power ''P'' transmitted to the vehicle is <math>P = F*V</math> for thrust ''F'' and speed ''V''). Then the largest portion of the energy is dissipated in the exhaust's interaction with the ambient air, producing noise. This noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs, by water injection around the jet and by deflecting the jet at an angle.\n\n==Testing==\n\nRocket engines are usually statically tested at a [[rocket engine test facility|test facility]] before being put into production. For high altitude engines, either a shorter nozzle must be used, or the rocket must be tested in a large vacuum chamber.\n\n==Safety==\n[[Rocket]] vehicles have a reputation for unreliability and danger; especially catastrophic failures. Contrary to this reputation, carefully designed rockets can be made arbitrarily reliable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In military use, rockets are not unreliable. However, one of the main non-military uses of rockets is for orbital launch. In this application, the premium has typically been placed on minimum weight, and it is difficult to achieve high reliability and low weight simultaneously. In addition, if the number of flights launched is low, there is a very high chance of a design, operations or manufacturing error causing destruction of the vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Saturn family (1961\u20131975)===\nThe [[Rocketdyne H-1]] engine, used in a cluster of eight in the first stage of the [[Saturn I]] and [[Saturn IB]] [[launch vehicle]]s, had no catastrophic failures in 152 engine-flights.

Assuming that the chemical potential energy of the propellants can be safely stored, the combustion process results in a great deal of heat being released. A significant fraction of this heat is transferred to kinetic energy in the engine nozzle, propelling the rocket forward in combination with the mass of combustion products released.\n\nIdeally all the reaction energy appears as kinetic energy of the exhaust gases, as exhaust velocity is the single most important performance parameter of an engine. However, real exhaust species are [[molecule]]s, which typically have translation, vibrational, and rotational modes with which to dissipate energy. Of these, only translation can do useful work to the vehicle, and while energy does transfer between modes this process occurs on a timescale far in excess of the time required for the exhaust to leave the nozzle.\n\nThe more [[chemical bond]]s an exhaust molecule has, the more rotational and vibrational modes it will have. Consequently, it is generally desirable for the exhaust species to be as simple as possible, with a diatomic molecule composed of light, abundant atoms such as H<sub>2</sub> being ideal in practical terms. However, in the case of a chemical rocket, hydrogen is a reactant and [[reducing agent]], not a product. An [[oxidizing agent]], most typically oxygen or an oxygen-rich species, must be introduced into the combustion process, adding mass and chemical bonds to the exhaust species.\n\nAn additional advantage of light molecules is that they may be accelerated to high velocity at temperatures that can be contained by currently available materials - the high gas temperatures in rocket engines pose serious problems for the engineering of survivable motors.\n\nLiquid [[hydrogen]] (LH2) and [[oxygen]] (LOX, or LO2), are the most effective propellants in terms of exhaust velocity that have been widely used to date, though a few exotic combinations involving boron or liquid ozone are potentially somewhat better in theory if various practical problems could be solved.<ref>[http://yarchive.net/space/rocket/fuels/fuel_ratio.html Newsgroup correspondence], 1998\u201399</ref>\n\nIt is important to note that, when computing the specific reaction energy of a given propellant combination, the entire mass of the propellants (both fuel and oxidizer) must be included. The exception is in the case of air-breathing engines, which use atmospheric oxygen and consequently have to carry less mass for a given energy output. Fuels for car or [[turbojet engine]]s have a much better effective energy output per unit mass of propellant that must be carried, but are similar per unit mass of fuel.\n\nComputer programs that predict the performance of propellants in rocket engines are available.<ref>[http://rocketworkbench.sourceforge.net/equil.phtml Complex chemical equilibrium and rocket performance calculations], Cpropep-Web</ref><ref>[http://propulsion-analysis.com/ Tool for Rocket Propulsion Analysis], RPA</ref><ref>[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/CEAWeb/ NASA Computer program Chemical Equilibrium with Applications], CEA</ref>\n\n==Ignition==\n{{further|Combustion}}\nWith liquid and hybrid rockets, immediate ignition of the propellant(s) as they first enter the combustion chamber is essential.\n\nWith liquid propellants (but not gaseous), failure to ignite within milliseconds usually causes too much liquid propellant to be inside the chamber, and if/when ignition occurs the amount of hot gas created can exceed the maximum design pressure of the chamber, causing a catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel.\nThis is sometimes called a ''[[hard start]]'' or a ''rapid unscheduled disassembly'' (RUD).<ref name=aw20121126>\n{{cite news |last=Svitak|first=Amy |title=Falcon 9 RUD? |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&plckPostId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post:c973f72f-55d3-4374-b722-df31a8d333e6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321053215/http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&plckPostId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post:c973f72f-55d3-4374-b722-df31a8d333e6 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-03-21 |accessdate=2014-03-21 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=2012-11-26 }}</ref>\n\nIgnition can be achieved by a number of different methods; a pyrotechnic charge can be used, a plasma torch can be used,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} or electric spark ignition<ref name=nsf20161003>\n{{cite news |last=Belluscio|first=Alejandro G. |title=ITS Propulsion \u2013 The evolution of the SpaceX Raptor engine |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2016-10-03 |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/10/its-propulsion-evolution-raptor-engine/ |accessdate=2016-10-03 }}</ref> may be employed.

These are due to cyclic variations in the jet pressure relative to ambient creating shock waves that form 'Mach disks'.\n\nThe shape of the jet varies by the design altitude: at high altitude all rockets are grossly under-expanded, and a quite small percentage of exhaust gases actually end up expanding forwards.\n\n==Types of rocket engines==\n\n===Physically powered===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Lower performance than liquid rockets. If grain cracks it can block nozzle with disastrous results. Grain cracks burn and widen during burn. Refueling harder than simply filling tanks. \n|-\n! [[Hybrid rocket]]\n| Separate oxidiser/fuel; typically the oxidiser is liquid and kept in a tank and the fuel is solid.\n| Quite simple, solid fuel is essentially inert without oxidiser, safer; cracks do not escalate, throttleable and easy to switch off.\n| Some oxidisers are monopropellants, can explode in own right; mechanical failure of solid propellant can block nozzle (very rare with rubberised propellant), central hole widens over burn and negatively affects mixture ratio.\n|-\n! [[Monopropellant rocket]]\n| Propellant (such as hydrazine, hydrogen peroxide or nitrous oxide) flows over a catalyst and exothermically decomposes; hot gases are emitted through nozzle.\n| Simple in concept, throttleable, low temperatures in combustion chamber\n| Catalysts can be easily contaminated, monopropellants can detonate if contaminated or provoked, [[Specific Impulse|''I''<sub>sp</sub>]] is perhaps 1/3 of best liquids\n|-\n!

[[Tripropellant rocket]] \n| Three different propellants (usually hydrogen, hydrocarbon, and liquid oxygen) are introduced into a combustion chamber in variable mixture ratios, or multiple engines are used with fixed propellant mixture ratios and throttled or shut down\n| Reduces take-off weight, since hydrogen is lighter; combines good thrust to weight with high average [[specific impulse|''I''<sub>sp</sub>]], improves payload for launching from Earth by a sizeable percentage\n| Similar issues to bipropellant, but with more plumbing, more research and development\n|-\n! [[Air-augmented rocket]]\n| Essentially a ramjet where intake air is compressed and burnt with the exhaust from a rocket\n| Mach 0 to Mach 4.5+ (can also run exoatmospheric), good efficiency at Mach 2 to 4\n| Similar efficiency to rockets at low speed or exoatmospheric, inlet difficulties, a relatively undeveloped and unexplored type, cooling difficulties, very noisy, thrust/weight ratio is similar to ramjets.\n|-\n! [[Turborocket]]\n| A combined cycle turbojet/rocket where an additional oxidiser such as oxygen is added to the airstream to increase maximum altitude\n| Very close to existing designs, operates in very high altitude, wide range of altitude and airspeed\n| Atmospheric airspeed limited to same range as turbojet engine, carrying oxidiser like [[LOX]] can be dangerous. Much heavier than simple rockets.\n|-\n! [[Precooled jet engine]] / [[liquid air cycle engine|LACE]] (combined cycle with rocket)\n|Intake air is chilled to very low temperatures at inlet before passing through a ramjet or turbojet engine. Can be combined with a rocket engine for orbital insertion.\n| Easily tested on ground. High thrust/weight ratios are possible (~14) together with good fuel efficiency over a wide range of airspeeds, mach 0-5.5+; this combination of efficiencies may permit launching to orbit, single stage, or very rapid intercontinental travel.\n| Exists only at the lab prototyping stage.

It was created almost two millennia before the [[Industrial Revolution]] but the principles behind it were not well understood, and its full potential was not realised for a millennium.<!--Not sure what this latter refers to, but it's probably not critical here-->\n\nThe availability of [[black powder]] to propel projectiles was a precursor to the development of the first solid rocket. Ninth Century [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Taoist]] [[Alchemy|alchemists]] discovered black powder in a search for the [[elixir of life]]; this accidental discovery led to [[fire arrow]]s which were the first rocket engines to leave the ground.\n\nIt is stated that \"the reactive forces of incendiaries were probably not applied to the propulsion of projectiles prior to the 13th century\". A turning point in rocket technology emerged with a short manuscript entitled ''Liber Ignium ad Comburendos Hostes'' (abbreviated as ''The Book of Fires''). The manuscript is composed of recipes for creating incendiary weapons from the mid-eighth to the end of the thirteenth centuries\u2014two of which are rockets.  The first recipe calls for one part of colophonium and sulfur added to six parts of saltpeter (potassium nitrate) dissolved in [[Lauraceae|laurel]] oil, then inserted into hollow wood and lit to \"fly away suddenly to whatever place you wish and burn up everything\".  The second recipe combines one pound of sulfur, two pounds of charcoal, and six pounds of saltpeter\u2014all finely powdered on a marble slab.  This powder mixture is packed firmly into a long and narrow case.  The introduction of saltpeter into pyrotechnic mixtures connected the shift from hurled [[Greek fire]] into self-propelled rocketry. .<ref>{{cite book|last1=Von Braun|last2= Ordway III|first1=Wernher |first2= Frederick I.|title=The Rockets' Red Glare|url=https://archive.org/details/rocketsredglare0000vonb|url-access=registration|date=1976|publisher=Anchor Press/ Doubleday|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=9780385078474|page=[https://archive.org/details/rocketsredglare0000vonb/page/5 5]}}</ref>\n\nArticles and books on the subject of rocketry appeared increasingly from the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.  In the sixteenth century, German military engineer Conrad Haas (1509\u20131576) wrote a manuscript which introduced the construction to multi-staged rockets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Von Braun|last2= Ordway III|first1=Wernher |first2= Frederick I.|title=The Rockets' Red Glare|url=https://archive.org/details/rocketsredglare0000vonb|url-access=registration|date=1976|publisher=Anchor Press/ Doubleday|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=9780385078474|page=[https://archive.org/details/rocketsredglare0000vonb/page/11 11]}}</ref>\n\nRocket engines were also brought in use by [[Tippu Sultan]], the king of Mysore. These rockets could be of various sizes, but usually consisted of a tube of soft hammered iron about {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1+1/2|-|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} diameter, closed at one end and strapped to a shaft of bamboo about {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=on}} long. The iron tube acted as a combustion chamber and contained well packed black powder propellant. A rocket carrying about one pound of powder could travel almost {{convert|1000|yd|m}}. These 'rockets', fitted with swords used to travel long distance, several meters above in air before coming down with swords edges facing the enemy. These rockets were used against British empire very effectively.\n\nSlow development of this technology continued up to the later 19th century, when Russian [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] first wrote about [[liquid rocket|liquid-fueled rocket engines]]. He was the first to develop the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]], though it was not published widely for some years.\n\nThe modern solid- and liquid-fueled engines became realities early in the 20th century, thanks to the American physicist [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]]. Goddard was the first to use a [[De Laval nozzle]] on a solid-propellant (gunpowder) rocket engine, doubling the thrust and increasing the efficiency by a factor of about twenty-five. This was the birth of the modern rocket engine. He calculated from his independently-derived rocket equation that a reasonably sized rocket, using solid fuel, could place a one-pound payload on the Moon. He began to use liquid propellants in 1921 and was the first to launch, in 1926, a liquid-propellant rocket. Goddard pioneered the use of the De Laval nozzle, lightweight propellant tanks, small light turbopumps, thrust vectoring, the smoothly-throttled liquid fuel engine, regenerative cooling, and curtain cooling.<ref name=Sutton/>{{rp|247\u2013266}}\n\nDuring the late 1930s, German scientists, such as [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Hellmuth Walter]], investigated installing liquid-fueled rockets in military aircraft ([[Heinkel He 112]], [[Heinkel He 111|He 111]], [[Heinkel He 176|He 176]] and [[Messerschmitt Me 163]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=Lutz Warsitz|title=The First Jet Pilot \u2013 The Story of German Test Pilot Erich Warsitz|edition=|publisher=Pen and Sword Ltd.|date=2009|ISBN=978-1-84415-818-8}} Includes von Braun's and Hellmuth Walter's experiments with rocket aircraft. [http://www.pen-and-sword.co.uk/?product_id=1762 English edition.]</ref>\n\nThe turbopump was employed by German scientists in World War II. Until then cooling the nozzle had been problematic, and the [[V-2 rocket|A4]] ballistic missile used dilute alcohol for the fuel, which reduced the combustion temperature sufficiently.\n\n[[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|Staged combustion]] (''\u0417\u0430\u043c\u043a\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0445\u0435\u043c\u0430'') was first proposed by [[Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev|Alexey Isaev]] in 1949. The first staged combustion engine was the S1.5400 used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev.<ref name=Sutton>{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George P.|title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines|date=2005|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Reston, Virginia}}</ref> About the same time (1959), [[Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kuznetsov|Nikolai Kuznetsov]] began work on the closed cycle engine [[NK-9]] for Korolev's orbital ICBM, GR-1. Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the [[NK-15]] and [[NK-33]] engines for the unsuccessful Lunar [[N1 rocket]].\n\nIn the West, the first laboratory staged-combustion test engine was built in Germany in 1963, by [[Ludwig Boelkow]].\n\nHydrogen peroxide / kerosene fueled engines such as the British [[Gamma (Rocket engine)|Gamma]] of the 1950s used a closed-cycle process (arguably not ''staged combustion'', but that's mostly a question of semantics) by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines ''before'' combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper. This gave the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, whilst avoiding the major engineering problems.\n\nLiquid hydrogen engines were first successfully developed in America, the [[RL-10]] engine first flew in 1962. Hydrogen engines were used as part of the [[Apollo program]]; the liquid hydrogen fuel giving a rather lower stage mass and thus reducing the overall size and cost of the vehicle.\n\nMost engines on one rocket flight was 44 set by NASA in 2016 on a [[Black Brant (rocket)|Black Brant]].<ref>https://www.space.com/33810-nasa-world-record-most-rocket-engines.html</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Comparison of orbital rocket engines]]\n*[[Jet damping]] an effect of the exhaust jet of a rocket that tends to slow a vehicle's rotation speed\n*[[Laser propulsion]]\n*[[Model rocket motor classification]] lettered engines\n*[[NERVA]] \u2013 [[NASA]]'s Nuclear Energy for Rocket Vehicle Applications, a US nuclear thermal rocket programme\n*[[Photon rocket]]\n*[[Project Prometheus]], NASA development of nuclear propulsion for long-duration spaceflight, begun in 2003\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Rocket engines}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071009153749/http://www.pwrengineering.com/articles/longterm.htm Designing for rocket engine life expectancy]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007070232/http://www.pwrengineering.com/articles/plume.htm Rocket Engine performance analysis with Plume Spectrometry]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071009151907/http://www.pwrengineering.com/articles/heart.htm Rocket Engine Thrust Chamber technical article]\n*[http://www.fxsolver.com/browse/formulas/Net+Thrust+of+a+Rocket+Engine Net Thrust of a Rocket Engine calculator]\n*[http://www.lpre.de/resources/software/RPA_en.htm Design Tool for Liquid Rocket Engine Thermodynamic Analysis]\n*[http://www.braeunig.us/space/propuls.htm Rocket & Space Technology - Rocket Propulsion]\n*[http://www.erichwarsitz.com/ The official website of test pilot Erich Warsitz (world's first jet pilot) which includes videos of the Heinkel He 112 fitted with von Braun's and Hellmuth Walter's rocket engines (as well as the He 111 with ATO Units)]\n\n{{Rocket engines}}\n{{Aircraft gas turbine engine components}}\n{{Heat engines|state=uncollapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rocket Engine}}\n[[Category:Spacecraft components]]\n[[Category:Aerospace engineering]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Jet engine using stored propellant to produce jet propulsion}}\n{{About|a type of reaction engine|rocket-propelled vehicles|Rocket|reaction engines not possessing a de Laval nozzle|Reaction engine}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Image:RS-68 rocket engine test.jpg|thumb|right|[[RS-68]] being tested at NASA's [[Stennis Space Center]].

The fluid is usually a gas created by high pressure ({{convert|10|to|300|bar|psi|order=flip|adj=on}}) combustion of solid or liquid [[Rocket propellant|propellants]], consisting of [[fuel]] and [[oxidizing agent|oxidiser]] components, within a [[combustion chamber]]. As the gases expand through the nozzle, they are accelerated to very high ([[supersonic]]) speed, and the reaction to this pushes the engine in the opposite direction. Combustion is most frequently used for practical rockets, as high temperatures and pressures are desirable for the best performance.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nA [[model rocket]]ry alternative to combustion is the [[water rocket]], which uses water pressurized by compressed air, [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrogen]], or any other readily available, inert gas.\n\n===Propellant===\nRocket propellant is mass that is stored, usually in some form of propellant tank, or within the combustion chamber itself, prior to being ejected from a rocket engine in the form of a fluid jet to produce thrust.\n\nChemical rocket propellants are most commonly used, which undergo exothermic chemical reactions which produce hot gas which is used by a rocket for propulsive purposes. Alternatively, a chemically inert [[reaction mass]] can be heated using a high-energy power source via a heat exchanger, and then no combustion chamber is used.\n\n[[Solid rocket]] propellants are prepared as a mixture of fuel and oxidising components called 'grain' and the propellant storage casing effectively becomes the combustion chamber.\n\n===Injection===\n[[Liquid rocket|Liquid-fuelled rockets]] force separate fuel and oxidiser components into the combustion chamber, where they mix and burn. [[Hybrid rocket]] engines use a combination of solid and liquid or gaseous propellants.

These are often an array of simple [[jet (nozzle)|jet]]s \u2013 holes through which the propellant escapes under pressure; but sometimes may be more complex spray nozzles. When two or more propellants are injected, the jets usually deliberately cause the propellants to collide as this breaks up the flow into smaller droplets that burn more easily.\n\n===Combustion chamber===\nFor chemical rockets the combustion chamber is typically cylindrical, and [[flame holder]]s are not used.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The dimensions of the cylinder are such that the propellant is able to combust thoroughly; different [[rocket propellant]]s require different combustion chamber sizes for this to occur.\n\nThis leads to a number called <math>L^*</math>:{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n:<math>L^* = \\frac {V_c} {A_t}</math>\nwhere:\n*<math>V_c</math> is the volume of the chamber\n*<math>A_t</math> is the area of the throat of the nozzle.\nL* is typically in the range of {{convert|25|-|60|in|m}}.\n\nThe combination of temperatures and pressures typically reached in a combustion chamber is usually extreme by any standard. Unlike in [[airbreathing jet engine]]s, no atmospheric nitrogen is present to dilute and cool the combustion, and the propellant mixture can reach true [[stoichiometric]] ratios. This, in combination with the high pressures, means that the rate of heat conduction through the walls is very high.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn order for fuel and oxidizer to flow into the chamber, the pressure of the propellant fluids entering the combustion chamber must exceed the pressure inside the combustion chamber itself.  This may be accomplished by a variety of design approaches including [[turbopump]]s or, in simpler engines, via [[Pressure-fed cycle (rocket)|sufficient tank pressure]] to advance fluid flow. Tank pressure may be maintained by several means, including a high-pressure [[helium]] pressurization system common to many large rocket engines or, in some newer rocket systems, by a bleed-off of high-pressure gas from the engine cycle to [[autogenous pressurization|autogenously pressurize]] the propellant tanks<ref name=nsf20160927>\n{{cite news |last=Bergin|first=Chris |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/09/spacex-reveals-mars-game-changer-colonization-plan/ |title=SpaceX reveals ITS Mars game changer via colonization plan |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2016-09-27 |accessdate=2016-09-27 }}</ref><ref name=sfi20160927/>  For example, the self-pressurization gas system of the [[SpaceX Starship]] is a critical part of SpaceX strategy to reduce launch vehicle fluids from five in their legacy Falcon 9 vehicle family to just two in Starship, eliminating not only the helium tank pressurant but all [[hypergolic propellant]]s as well as [[nitrogen]] for cold-gas [[reaction control system|reaction-control thrusters]].<ref name=nsf20161003/>\n\n===Nozzle===\n{{Main|Rocket engine nozzle}}\n[[File:Rocket thrust.svg|thumb|right|Rocket thrust is caused by pressures acting in the combustion chamber and nozzle. From Newton's third law, equal and opposite pressures act on the exhaust, and this accelerates it to high speeds.]]\nThe hot gas produced in the combustion chamber is permitted to escape through an opening (the \"throat\"), and then through a diverging expansion section. When sufficient pressure is provided to the nozzle (about 2.5-3 times ambient pressure), the nozzle ''[[choked flow|choke]]s'' and a supersonic jet is formed, dramatically accelerating the gas, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speeds vary, depending on the expansion ratio the nozzle is designed for, but exhaust speeds as high as ten times the [[speed of sound]] in air at sea level are not uncommon. About half of the rocket engine's thrust comes from the unbalanced pressures inside the combustion chamber, and the rest comes from the pressures acting against the inside of the nozzle (see diagram). As the gas expands ([[Adiabatic process|adiabatically]]) the pressure against the nozzle's walls forces the rocket engine in one direction while accelerating the gas in the other.\n\n{{Anchor|opt_expansion}} <!-- add anchor for diagram references --->\n[[File:Rocket nozzle expansion.svg|thumb|right|upright|The four expansion regimes of a de Laval nozzle:<br />\n\u2022 under-expanded<br />\n\u2022 perfectly expanded<br />\n\u2022 over-expanded<br />\n\u2022 grossly over-expanded]]\nThe most commonly used nozzle is the [[de Laval nozzle]], a fixed geometry nozzle with a high expansion-ratio. The large bell- or cone-shaped nozzle extension beyond the throat gives the rocket engine its characteristic shape.\n\nThe exit [[static pressure#Static pressure in fluid dynamics|static pressure]] of the exhaust jet depends on the chamber pressure and the ratio of exit to throat area of the nozzle. As exit pressure varies from the ambient (atmospheric) pressure, a choked nozzle is said to be\n* '''under-expanded''' (exit pressure greater than ambient),\n* '''perfectly expanded''' (exit pressure equals ambient),\n* '''over-expanded''' (exit pressure less than ambient; [[shock diamond]]s form outside the nozzle), or\n* '''grossly over-expanded''' (a [[shock wave]] forms inside the nozzle extension).\n\nIn practice, perfect expansion is only achievable with a variable-exit area nozzle (since ambient pressure decreases as altitude increases), and is not possible above a certain altitude as ambient pressure approaches zero. If the nozzle is not perfectly expanded, then loss of efficiency occurs. Grossly over-expanded nozzles lose less efficiency, but can cause mechanical problems with the nozzle. Fixed-area nozzles become progressively more under-expanded as they gain altitude. Almost all de Laval nozzles will be momentarily grossly over-expanded during startup in an atmosphere.<ref>Dexter K Huzel and David H. Huang (1971), [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710019929_1971019929.pdf NASA SP-125, Design of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines] &nbsp;Second edition of a technical report obtained from the website of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</ref>\n\nNozzle efficiency is affected by operation in the atmosphere because atmospheric pressure changes with altitude; but due to the supersonic speeds of the gas exiting from a rocket engine, the pressure of the jet may be either below or above ambient, and equilibrium between the two is not reached at all altitudes (see diagram).\n\n====Back pressure and optimal expansion====\nFor optimal performance, the pressure of the gas at the end of the nozzle should just equal the ambient pressure: if the exhaust's pressure is lower than the ambient pressure, then the vehicle will be slowed by the difference in pressure between the top of the engine and the exit; on the other hand, if the exhaust's pressure is higher, then exhaust pressure that could have been converted into thrust is not converted, and energy is wasted.\n\nTo maintain this ideal of equality between the exhaust's exit pressure and the ambient pressure, the diameter of the nozzle would need to increase with altitude, giving the pressure a longer nozzle to act on (and reducing the exit pressure and temperature). This increase is difficult to arrange in a lightweight fashion, although is routinely done with other forms of jet engines. In rocketry a lightweight compromise nozzle is generally used and some reduction in atmospheric performance occurs when used at other than the 'design altitude' or when throttled. To improve on this, various exotic nozzle designs such as the [[plug nozzle]], [[stepped nozzles]], the [[expanding nozzle]] and the [[aerospike engine|aerospike]] have been proposed, each providing some way to adapt to changing ambient air pressure and each allowing the gas to expand further against the nozzle, giving extra thrust at higher altitudes.\n\nWhen exhausting into a sufficiently low ambient pressure (vacuum) several issues arise. One is the sheer weight of the nozzle\u2014beyond a certain point, for a particular vehicle, the extra weight of the nozzle outweighs any performance gained. Secondly, as the exhaust gases adiabatically expand within the nozzle they cool, and eventually some of the chemicals can freeze, producing 'snow' within the jet. This causes instabilities in the jet and must be avoided.\n\nOn a [[de Laval nozzle]], exhaust gas flow detachment will occur in a grossly over-expanded nozzle.  As the detachment point will not be uniform around the axis of the engine, a side force may be imparted to the engine. This side force may change over time and result in control problems with the launch vehicle.\n\nAdvanced [[altitude compensating nozzle|altitude-compensating]] designs, such as the [[aerospike engine|aerospike]] or [[plug nozzle]], attempt to minimize performance losses by adjusting to varying expansion ratio caused by changing altitude.\n\n===Propellant efficiency===\n{{see also|Specific impulse}}\n[[Image:Nozzle de Laval diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright|Typical temperature (T), pressure (p), and velocity (v) profiles in a de Laval Nozzle]]\nFor a rocket engine to be propellant efficient, it is important that the maximum pressures possible be created on the walls of the chamber and nozzle by a specific amount of propellant; as this is the source of the thrust. This can be achieved by all of:\n\n*heating the propellant to as high a temperature as possible (using a high energy fuel, containing hydrogen and carbon and sometimes metals such as [[aluminium]], or even using nuclear energy)\n*using a low specific density gas (as hydrogen rich as possible)\n*using propellants which are, or decompose to, simple molecules with few degrees of freedom to maximise translational velocity\n\nSince all of these things minimise the mass of the propellant used, and since pressure is proportional to the mass of propellant present to be accelerated as it pushes on the engine, and since from [[Newton's third law]] the pressure that acts on the engine also reciprocally acts on the propellant, it turns out that for any given engine, the speed that the propellant leaves the chamber is unaffected by the chamber pressure (although the thrust is proportional). However, speed is significantly affected by all three of the above factors and the exhaust speed is an excellent measure of the engine propellant efficiency. This is termed ''exhaust velocity'', and after allowance is made for factors that can reduce it, the '''[[effective exhaust velocity]]''' is one of the most important parameters of a rocket engine (although weight, cost, ease of manufacture etc. are usually also very important).\n\nFor aerodynamic reasons the flow goes sonic (\"[[Choked flow|chokes]]\") at the narrowest part of the nozzle, the 'throat'. Since the [[speed of sound]] in gases increases with the square root of temperature, the use of hot exhaust gas greatly improves performance. By comparison, at room temperature the speed of sound in air is about 340&nbsp;m/s while the speed of sound in the hot gas of a rocket engine can be over 1700&nbsp;m/s; much of this performance is due to the higher temperature, but additionally rocket propellants are chosen to be of low molecular mass, and this also gives a higher velocity compared to air.\n\nExpansion in the rocket nozzle then further multiplies the speed, typically between 1.5 and 2 times, giving a highly [[collimated]] hypersonic exhaust jet. The speed increase of a rocket nozzle is mostly determined by its area expansion ratio\u2014the ratio of the area of the throat to the area at the exit, but detailed properties of the gas are also important. Larger ratio nozzles are more massive but are able to extract more heat from the combustion gases, increasing the exhaust velocity.\n\n===Thrust vectoring===\n{{main|Thrust vectoring}}\nVehicles typically require the overall thrust to change direction over the length of the burn. A number of different ways to achieve this have been flown:\n\n*The entire engine is mounted on a [[hinge]] or [[gimbal]] and any propellant feeds reach the engine via low pressure flexible pipes or rotary couplings.\n*Just the combustion chamber and nozzle is gimballed, the pumps are fixed, and high pressure feeds attach to the engine.\n*Multiple engines (often canted at slight angles) are deployed but throttled to give the overall vector that is required, giving only a very small penalty.\n*High-temperature vanes protrude into the exhaust and can be tilted to deflect the jet.\n\n==Overall performance==\nRocket technology can combine very high thrust ([[meganewton]]s), very high exhaust speeds (around 10 times the speed of sound in air at sea level) and very high thrust/weight ratios (>100) ''simultaneously'' as well as being able to operate outside the atmosphere, and while permitting the use of low pressure and hence lightweight tanks and structure.\n\nRockets can be further optimised to even more extreme performance along one or more of these axes at the expense of the others.\n\n===Specific impulse===\n{{Specific impulse|align=right}}\n{{Main|Specific impulse}}\n\nThe most important metric for the efficiency of a rocket engine is [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] per unit of [[propellant]], this is called [[specific impulse]] (usually written <math>I_{sp}</math>). This is either measured as a speed (the ''effective exhaust velocity'' <math>v_{e}</math> in metres/second or ft/s) or as a time (seconds). For example, if an engine producing 100 pounds of thrust runs for 320 seconds and burns 100 pounds of propellant, then the specific impulse is 320 seconds. The higher the specific impulse, the less propellant is required to provide the desired impulse.\n\nThe specific impulse that can be achieved is primarily a function of the propellant mix (and ultimately would limit the specific impulse), but practical limits on chamber pressures and the nozzle expansion ratios reduce the performance that can be achieved.\n\n===Net thrust===\n{{main|Thrust}}\nBelow is an approximate equation for calculating the net thrust of a rocket engine:<ref>{{cite book|author=George P. Sutton|author2=Oscar Biblarz|last-author-amp=yes|title=Rocket Propulsion Elements|edition=7th|publisher=Wiley Interscience|date=2001|ISBN=0-471-32642-9}} See Equation 2-14.</ref>\n\n:<math>F_n = \\dot{m}\\;v_{e} = \\dot{m}\\;v_{e-opt} + A_{e}(p_{e} - p_{amb})</math>\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=right|where:\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=right|<math>\\dot{m}</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; exhaust gas mass flow\n|- \n!align=right|<math>v_{e}</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; effective exhaust velocity\n|-\n!align=right|<math>v_{e-opt}</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; effective jet velocity when Pamb = Pe\n|-\n!align=right|<math>A_{e}</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; flow area at nozzle exit plane (or the plane where the jet leaves the nozzle if separated flow)\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_{e}</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; static pressure at nozzle exit plane\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_{amb}</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; ambient (or atmospheric) pressure\n|}\n\nSince, unlike a jet engine, a conventional rocket motor lacks an air intake, there is no 'ram drag' to deduct from the gross thrust. Consequently, the net thrust of a rocket motor is equal to the gross thrust (apart from static back pressure).\n\nThe <math>\\dot{m}\\;v_{e-opt}\\,</math> term represents the momentum thrust, which remains constant at a given throttle setting, whereas the <math>A_{e}(p_{e} - p_{amb})\\,</math> term represents the pressure thrust term. At full throttle, the net thrust of a rocket motor improves slightly with increasing altitude, because as atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, the pressure thrust term increases. At the surface of the Earth the pressure thrust may be reduced by up to 30%, depending on the engine design. This reduction drops roughly exponentially to zero with increasing altitude.\n\nMaximum efficiency for a rocket engine is achieved by maximising the momentum contribution of the equation without incurring penalties from over expanding the exhaust. This occurs when <math>p_{e} = p_{amb}</math>. Since ambient pressure changes with altitude, most rocket engines spend very little time operating at peak efficiency.\n\nSince specific impulse is force divided by the rate of mass flow, this equation means that the specific impulse varies with altitude.\n\n===Vacuum specific impulse, I<sub>sp</sub>===\n\nDue to the specific impulse varying with pressure, a quantity that is easy to compare and calculate with is useful. Because rockets [[choked flow|choke]] at the throat, and because the supersonic exhaust prevents external pressure influences travelling upstream, it turns out that the pressure at the exit is ideally exactly proportional to the propellant flow <math> \\dot{m}</math>, provided the mixture ratios and combustion efficiencies are maintained. It is thus quite usual to rearrange the above equation slightly:<ref>{{cite book|author=George P.

In liquid and hybrid rockets, the propellant flow entering the chamber is controlled using valves, in [[solid rocket]]s it is controlled by changing the area of propellant that is burning and this can be designed into the propellant grain (and hence cannot be controlled in real-time).\n\nRockets can usually be throttled down to an exit pressure of about one-third of ambient pressure<ref name=Sutton/> (often limited by flow separation in nozzles) and up to a maximum limit determined only by the mechanical strength of the engine.\n\nIn practice, the degree to which rockets can be throttled varies greatly, but most rockets can be throttled by a factor of 2 without great difficulty;<ref name=Sutton/> the typical limitation is combustion stability, as for example, injectors need a minimum pressure to avoid triggering damaging oscillations (chugging or combustion instabilities); but injectors can be optimised and tested for wider ranges.\nFor example, some more recent liquid-propellant engine designs that have been optimised for greater throttling capability ([[BE-3]], [[Raptor (rocket engine)|Raptor]]) can be throttled to as low as 18\u201320 percent of rated thrust.<!-- eg, Blue Orgin BE-3 --><ref name=sn20150407>\n{{cite news |last1=Foust|first=Jeff |title=Blue Origin Completes BE-3 Engine as BE-4 Work Continues |url=http://spacenews.com/blue-origin-completes-be-3-engine-as-be-4-work-continues/ |accessdate=2016-10-20 |work=Space News |date=2015-04-07 }}</ref><!-- eg, SpaceX Raptor --><ref name=sfi20160927>\n{{cite news |url= http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/space-exploration-technologies/elon-musk-shows-off-interplanetary-transport-system/ |title= Elon Musk Shows Off Interplanetary Transport System |publisher= Spaceflight Insider |last=Richardson|first=Derek |date=2016-09-27 |accessdate=2016-10-20 }}</ref>\nSolid rockets can be throttled by using shaped grains that will vary their surface area over the course of the burn.<ref name=Sutton/>\n\n===Energy efficiency===\n{{further|Rocket#Energy efficiency}}\n[[File:Rocket propulsion efficiency.svg|thumb|Rocket vehicle mechanical efficiency as a function of vehicle instantaneous speed divided by effective exhaust speed. These percentages need to be multiplied by internal engine efficiency to get overall efficiency.]]\nRocket engine nozzles are surprisingly efficient [[heat engines]] for generating a high speed jet, as a consequence of the high combustion temperature and high [[compression ratio]]. Rocket nozzles give an excellent approximation to [[adiabatic expansion]] which is a reversible process, and hence they give efficiencies which are very close to that of the [[Carnot cycle]]. Given the temperatures reached, over 60% efficiency can be achieved with chemical rockets.\n\nFor a ''vehicle'' employing a rocket engine the energetic efficiency is very good if the vehicle speed approaches or somewhat exceeds the exhaust velocity (relative to launch); but at low speeds the energy efficiency goes to 0% at zero speed (as with all [[jet propulsion]].) <!--- it's very counterintuitive, a way to look at it is that energy= force x distance, but at zero speed you have no movement and you lose lots of energy in the jet --->See [[Rocket#Energy efficiency|Rocket energy efficiency]] for more details.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Thrust-to-weight ratio===\n{{Main|thrust-to-weight ratio}}\nRockets, of all the jet engines, indeed of essentially all engines, have the highest thrust to weight ratio. This is especially true for liquid rocket engines.\n\nThis high performance is due to the small volume of [[pressure vessel]]s that make up the engine\u2014the pumps, pipes and combustion chambers involved. The lack of inlet duct and the use of dense liquid propellant allows the pressurisation system to be small and lightweight, whereas duct engines have to deal with air which has around three orders of magnitude lower density.\n\n{{Engine thrust to weight table}}\n\nOf the liquid propellants used, density is lowest for [[liquid hydrogen]]. Although this propellant has the highest [[specific impulse]], its very low density (about one fourteenth that of water) requires larger and heavier turbopumps and pipework, which decreases the engine's thrust-to-weight ratio (for example the RS-25) compared to those that do not (NK-33).\n\n==Cooling==\nFor efficiency reasons, higher temperatures are desirable, but materials lose their strength if the temperature becomes too high. Rockets run with combustion temperatures that can reach ~3,500 K (~3,200&nbsp;\u00b0C or ~5,800&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nMost other jet engines have gas turbines in the hot exhaust. Due to their larger surface area, they are harder to cool and hence there is a need to run the combustion processes at much lower temperatures, losing efficiency. In addition, [[wiktionary:duct engine|duct engines]] use air as an oxidant, which contains 78% largely unreactive nitrogen, which dilutes the reaction and lowers the temperatures.<ref name=Sutton/> Rockets have none of these inherent combustion temperature limiters.\n\nThe temperatures reached by rocket exhaust often substantially exceed the melting points of the nozzle and combustion chamber materials (~1,200 K for copper). Most construction materials will also combust if exposed to high temperature oxidizer, which leads to a number of design challenges. The nozzle and combustion temperature walls must not be allowed to combust, melt, or vaporize (sometimes facetiously termed an \"engine-rich exhaust\").\n\nRockets that use the common construction materials such as aluminium, steel, nickel or copper alloys must employ cooling systems to limit the temperatures that engine structures experience. [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|Regenerative cooling]], where the propellant is passed through tubes around the combustion chamber or nozzle, and other techniques, such as curtain cooling or film cooling, are employed to give longer nozzle and chamber life. These techniques ensure that a gaseous thermal [[boundary layer]] touching the material is kept below the temperature which would cause the material to catastrophically fail.\n\nTwo material exceptions that can directly sustain rocket exhaust temperatures are [[graphite]] and [[tungsten]], although both are subject to oxidation if not protected. Materials technology, combined with the engine design, is a limiting factor of the exhaust temperature of chemical rockets.\n\nIn rockets, the heat fluxes that can pass through the wall are among the highest in engineering; fluxes are generally in the range of 1-200 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. The strongest heat fluxes are found at the throat, which often sees twice that found in the associated chamber and nozzle. This is due to the combination of high speeds (which gives a very thin boundary layer), and although lower than the chamber, the high temperatures seen there. (See [[#Rocket nozzles|rocket nozzles]] above for temperatures in nozzle).\n\nIn rockets the coolant methods include:\n\n#uncooled (used for short runs mainly during testing)\n#[[ablation|ablative]] walls (walls are lined with a material that is continuously vaporised and carried away).\n#[[radiative cooling]] (the chamber becomes almost white hot and radiates the heat away)\n#dump cooling (a propellant, usually [[hydrogen]], is passed around the chamber and dumped)\n#[[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] ([[liquid rocket]]s use the fuel, or occasionally the oxidiser, to cool the chamber via a cooling jacket before being injected)\n#curtain cooling (propellant injection is arranged so the temperature of the gases is cooler at the walls)\n#film cooling (surfaces are wetted with liquid propellant, which cools as it evaporates)\n\nIn all cases the cooling effect that prevents the wall from being destroyed is caused by a thin layer of insulating fluid (a [[boundary layer]]) that is in contact with the walls that is far cooler than the combustion temperature. Provided this boundary layer is intact the wall will not be damaged.\n\nDisruption of the boundary layer may occur during cooling failures or combustion instabilities, and wall failure typically occurs soon after.\n\nWith regenerative cooling a second boundary layer is found in the coolant channels around the chamber. This boundary layer thickness needs to be as small as possible, since the boundary layer acts as an insulator between the wall and the coolant. This may be achieved by making the coolant [[velocity]] in the channels as high as possible.\n\nIn practice, regenerative cooling is nearly always used in conjunction with curtain cooling and/or film cooling.\n\nLiquid-fuelled engines are often run [[Air-fuel ratio|fuel-rich]], which lowers combustion temperatures.  This reduces heat loads on the engine and allows lower cost materials and a simplified cooling system. This can also ''increase'' performance by lowering the average molecular weight of the exhaust and increasing the efficiency with which combustion heat is converted to kinetic exhaust energy.\n\n==Mechanical issues==\nRocket combustion chambers are normally operated at fairly high pressure, typically 10\u2013200{{nbsp}}bar (1\u201320{{nbsp}}MPa, 150\u20133,000{{nbsp}}psi). When operated within significant atmospheric pressure, higher combustion chamber pressures give better performance by permitting a larger and more efficient nozzle to be fitted without it being grossly overexpanded.\n\nHowever, these high pressures cause the outermost part of the chamber to be under very large [[hoop stress]]es \u2013 rocket engines are [[pressure vessel]]s.\n\nWorse, due to the high temperatures created in rocket engines the materials used tend to have a significantly lowered working tensile strength.\n\nIn addition, significant temperature gradients are set up in the walls of the chamber and nozzle, these cause differential expansion of the inner liner that create [[internal stresses]].\n\n==Acoustic issues==\nThe extreme vibration and acoustic environment inside a rocket motor commonly result in peak stresses well above mean values, especially in the presence of [[organ pipe]]-like resonances and gas turbulence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/414364/whats-the-deal-with-rocket-vibrations/|title=What's the Deal with Rocket Vibrations?|last=Sauser|first=Brittany|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Combustion instabilities===\nThe combustion may display undesired instabilities, of sudden or periodic nature. The pressure in the injection chamber may increase until the propellant flow through the injector plate decreases; a moment later the pressure drops and the flow increases, injecting more propellant in the combustion chamber which burns a moment later, and again increases the chamber pressure, repeating the cycle. This may lead to high-amplitude pressure oscillations, often in ultrasonic range, which may damage the motor. Oscillations of \u00b1200&nbsp;psi at 25&nbsp;kHz were the cause of failures of early versions of the [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] missile second stage engines. The other failure mode is a [[deflagration to detonation transition]]; the supersonic [[Longitudinal wave|pressure wave]] formed in the combustion chamber may destroy the engine.<ref name=\"titan2\">{{cite book|author=David K. Stumpf|title=Titian II: A History of a Cold War Missile Program|edition=|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|date=2000|ISBN=1-55728-601-9}}</ref>\n\nCombustion instability was also a problem during [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]] development. The Rocketdyne engines used in the Atlas family were found to suffer from this effect in several static firing tests, and three missile launches exploded on the pad due to rough combustion in the booster engines. In most cases, it occurred while attempting to start the engines with a \"dry start\" method whereby the igniter mechanism would be activated prior to propellant injection. During the process of man-rating Atlas for [[Project Mercury]], solving combustion instability was a high priority, and the final two Mercury flights sported an upgraded propulsion system with baffled injectors and a hypergolic igniter.\n\nThe problem affecting Atlas vehicles was mainly the so-called \"racetrack\" phenomenon, where burning propellant would swirl around in a circle at faster and faster speeds, eventually producing vibration strong enough to rupture the engine, leading to complete destruction of the rocket. It was eventually solved by adding several baffles around the injector face to break up swirling propellant.\n\nMore significantly, combustion instability was a problem with the Saturn F-1 engines. Some of the early units tested exploded during static firing, which led to the addition of injector baffles.\n\nIn the Soviet space program, combustion instability also proved a problem on some rocket engines, including the RD-107 engine used in the R-7 family and the RD-216 used in the R-14 family, and several failures of these vehicles occurred before the problem was solved. Soviet engineering and manufacturing processes never satisfactorily resolved combustion instability in larger RP-1/LOX engines, so the RD-171 engine used to power the Zenit family still used four smaller thrust chambers fed by a common engine mechanism.\n\nThe combustion instabilities can be provoked by remains of cleaning solvents in the engine (e.g. the first attempted launch of a Titan II in 1962), reflected shock wave, initial instability after ignition, explosion near the nozzle that reflects into the combustion chamber, and many more factors. In stable engine designs the oscillations are quickly suppressed; in unstable designs they persist for prolonged periods. Oscillation suppressors are commonly used.\n\nPeriodic variations of thrust, caused by combustion instability or longitudinal vibrations of structures between the tanks and the engines which modulate the propellant flow, are known as \"[[pogo oscillation]]s\" or \"pogo\", named after the [[pogo stick]].\n\nThree different types of combustion instabilities occur:\n\n====Chugging====\nThis is a low frequency oscillation at a few Hertz in chamber pressure usually caused by pressure variations in feed lines due to variations in acceleration of the vehicle.<ref name=sutton1975/>{{rp|261}} \nThis can cause cyclic variation in thrust, and the effects can vary from merely annoying to actually damaging the payload or vehicle. Chugging can be minimised by using gas-filled damping tubes on feed lines of high density propellants.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n====Buzzing====\nThis can be caused due to insufficient pressure drop across the injectors.<ref name=sutton1975/>{{rp|261}} \nIt generally is mostly annoying, rather than being damaging. However, in extreme cases combustion can end up being forced backwards through the injectors \u2013 this can cause explosions with monopropellants.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n====Screeching====\nThis is the most immediately damaging, and the hardest to control. It is due to acoustics within the combustion chamber that often couples to the chemical combustion processes that are the primary drivers of the energy release, and can lead to unstable resonant \"screeching\" that commonly leads to catastrophic failure due to thinning of the insulating thermal boundary layer. Acoustic oscillations can be excited by thermal processes, such as the flow of hot air through a pipe or combustion in a chamber. Specifically, standing acoustic waves inside a chamber can be intensified if combustion occurs more intensely in regions where the pressure of the acoustic wave is maximal.<ref name=strutt1896>\n{{cite book|author=John W.

As the [[hypersonic]] exhaust mixes with the ambient air, [[shock wave]]s are formed. The [[Space Shuttle]] generates over 200 [[dB(A)]] of noise around its base. To reduce this, and the risk of payload damage or injury to the crew atop the stack, the [[mobile launcher platform]] was fitted with a [[Sound Suppression System]] that sprayed {{convert|1.1|e6L|USgal}} of water around the base of the rocket in 41 seconds at launch time. Using this system kept sound levels within the payload bay to 142&nbsp;dB <ref>{{Cite web\n  |title=Sound Suppression System\n  |publisher=NASA\n  |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/sound-suppression-system.html\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[sound intensity]] from the shock waves generated depends on the size of the rocket and on the exhaust velocity. Such shock waves seem to account for the characteristic crackling and popping sounds produced by large rocket engines when heard live. These noise peaks typically overload microphones and audio electronics, and so are generally weakened or entirely absent in recorded or broadcast audio reproductions. For large rockets at close range, the acoustic effects could actually kill.<ref name=\"CR566\">R.C. Potter and M.J. Crocker (1966). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660030602_1966030602.pdf NASA CR-566, Acoustic Prediction Methods For Rocket Engines, Including The Effects Of Clustered Engines And Deflected Flow] From website of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Langley (NASA Langley)</ref>\n\nMore worryingly for space agencies, such sound levels can also damage the launch structure, or worse, be reflected back at the comparatively delicate rocket above. This is why so much water is typically used at launches. The water spray changes the acoustic qualities of the air and reduces or deflects the sound energy away from the rocket.\n\nGenerally speaking, noise is most intense when a rocket is close to the ground, since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the jet, as well as reflecting off the ground. Also, when the vehicle is moving slowly, little of the chemical energy input to the engine can go into increasing the kinetic energy of the rocket (since useful power ''P'' transmitted to the vehicle is <math>P = F*V</math> for thrust ''F'' and speed ''V''). Then the largest portion of the energy is dissipated in the exhaust's interaction with the ambient air, producing noise. This noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs, by water injection around the jet and by deflecting the jet at an angle.\n\n==Testing==\n\nRocket engines are usually statically tested at a [[rocket engine test facility|test facility]] before being put into production. For high altitude engines, either a shorter nozzle must be used, or the rocket must be tested in a large vacuum chamber.\n\n==Safety==\n[[Rocket]] vehicles have a reputation for unreliability and danger; especially catastrophic failures. Contrary to this reputation, carefully designed rockets can be made arbitrarily reliable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In military use, rockets are not unreliable. However, one of the main non-military uses of rockets is for orbital launch. In this application, the premium has typically been placed on minimum weight, and it is difficult to achieve high reliability and low weight simultaneously. In addition, if the number of flights launched is low, there is a very high chance of a design, operations or manufacturing error causing destruction of the vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Saturn family (1961\u20131975)===\nThe [[Rocketdyne H-1]] engine, used in a cluster of eight in the first stage of the [[Saturn I]] and [[Saturn IB]] [[launch vehicle]]s, had no catastrophic failures in 152 engine-flights.

Assuming that the chemical potential energy of the propellants can be safely stored, the combustion process results in a great deal of heat being released. A significant fraction of this heat is transferred to kinetic energy in the engine nozzle, propelling the rocket forward in combination with the mass of combustion products released.\n\nIdeally all the reaction energy appears as kinetic energy of the exhaust gases, as exhaust velocity is the single most important performance parameter of an engine. However, real exhaust species are [[molecule]]s, which typically have translation, vibrational, and rotational modes with which to dissipate energy. Of these, only translation can do useful work to the vehicle, and while energy does transfer between modes this process occurs on a timescale far in excess of the time required for the exhaust to leave the nozzle.\n\nThe more [[chemical bond]]s an exhaust molecule has, the more rotational and vibrational modes it will have. Consequently, it is generally desirable for the exhaust species to be as simple as possible, with a diatomic molecule composed of light, abundant atoms such as H<sub>2</sub> being ideal in practical terms. However, in the case of a chemical rocket, hydrogen is a reactant and [[reducing agent]], not a product. An [[oxidizing agent]], most typically oxygen or an oxygen-rich species, must be introduced into the combustion process, adding mass and chemical bonds to the exhaust species.\n\nAn additional advantage of light molecules is that they may be accelerated to high velocity at temperatures that can be contained by currently available materials - the high gas temperatures in rocket engines pose serious problems for the engineering of survivable motors.\n\nLiquid [[hydrogen]] (LH2) and [[oxygen]] (LOX, or LO2), are the most effective propellants in terms of exhaust velocity that have been widely used to date, though a few exotic combinations involving boron or liquid ozone are potentially somewhat better in theory if various practical problems could be solved.<ref>[http://yarchive.net/space/rocket/fuels/fuel_ratio.html Newsgroup correspondence], 1998\u201399</ref>\n\nIt is important to note that, when computing the specific reaction energy of a given propellant combination, the entire mass of the propellants (both fuel and oxidizer) must be included. The exception is in the case of air-breathing engines, which use atmospheric oxygen and consequently have to carry less mass for a given energy output. Fuels for car or [[turbojet engine]]s have a much better effective energy output per unit mass of propellant that must be carried, but are similar per unit mass of fuel.\n\nComputer programs that predict the performance of propellants in rocket engines are available.<ref>[http://rocketworkbench.sourceforge.net/equil.phtml Complex chemical equilibrium and rocket performance calculations], Cpropep-Web</ref><ref>[http://propulsion-analysis.com/ Tool for Rocket Propulsion Analysis], RPA</ref><ref>[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/CEAWeb/ NASA Computer program Chemical Equilibrium with Applications], CEA</ref>\n\n==Ignition==\n{{further|Combustion}}\nWith liquid and hybrid rockets, immediate ignition of the propellant(s) as they first enter the combustion chamber is essential.\n\nWith liquid propellants (but not gaseous), failure to ignite within milliseconds usually causes too much liquid propellant to be inside the chamber, and if/when ignition occurs the amount of hot gas created can exceed the maximum design pressure of the chamber, causing a catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel.\nThis is sometimes called a ''[[hard start]]'' or a ''rapid unscheduled disassembly'' (RUD).<ref name=aw20121126>\n{{cite news |last=Svitak|first=Amy |title=Falcon 9 RUD? |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&plckPostId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post:c973f72f-55d3-4374-b722-df31a8d333e6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321053215/http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385&plckPostId=Blog:04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post:c973f72f-55d3-4374-b722-df31a8d333e6 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-03-21 |accessdate=2014-03-21 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=2012-11-26 }}</ref>\n\nIgnition can be achieved by a number of different methods; a pyrotechnic charge can be used, a plasma torch can be used,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} or electric spark ignition<ref name=nsf20161003>\n{{cite news |last=Belluscio|first=Alejandro G. |title=ITS Propulsion \u2013 The evolution of the SpaceX Raptor engine |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2016-10-03 |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/10/its-propulsion-evolution-raptor-engine/ |accessdate=2016-10-03 }}</ref> may be employed. Some fuel/oxidiser combinations ignite on contact ([[hypergolic]]), and non-hypergolic fuels can be \"chemically ignited\" by priming the fuel lines with hypergolic propellants (popular in Russian engines).\n\nGaseous propellants generally will not cause [[hard start]]s, with rockets the total injector area is less than the throat thus the chamber pressure tends to ambient prior to ignition and high pressures cannot form even if the entire chamber is full of flammable gas at ignition.\n\nSolid propellants are usually ignited with one-shot pyrotechnic devices.<ref name=Sutton/>\n\nOnce ignited, rocket chambers are self-sustaining and igniters are not needed.\nIndeed, chambers often spontaneously reignite if they are restarted after being shut down for a few seconds. However, when cooled, many rockets cannot be restarted without at least minor maintenance, such as replacement of the pyrotechnic igniter.<ref name=Sutton/>\n\n==Jet physics==\n[[File:Armadillo Aerospace Pixel Hover.jpg|thumb|right|Armadillo aerospace's quad vehicle showing visible banding (shock diamonds) in the exhaust jet]]\nRocket jets vary depending on the rocket engine, design altitude, altitude, thrust and other factors.\n\nCarbon rich exhausts from [[kerosene]] fuels are often orange in colour due to the [[black-body radiation]] of the unburnt particles, in addition to the blue [[Swan band]]s. [[high test peroxide|Peroxide]] oxidizer-based rockets and hydrogen rocket jets contain largely [[steam]] and are nearly invisible to the naked eye but shine brightly in the [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]]. Jets from [[solid rocket]]s can be highly visible as the propellant frequently contains metals such as elemental aluminium which burns with an orange-white flame and adds energy to the combustion process.\n\nSome exhausts, notably [[alcohol]] fuelled rockets, can show visible [[shock diamond]]s. These are due to cyclic variations in the jet pressure relative to ambient creating shock waves that form 'Mach disks'.\n\nThe shape of the jet varies by the design altitude: at high altitude all rockets are grossly under-expanded, and a quite small percentage of exhaust gases actually end up expanding forwards.\n\n==Types of rocket engines==\n\n===Physically powered===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was created almost two millennia before the [[Industrial Revolution]] but the principles behind it were not well understood, and its full potential was not realised for a millennium.<!--Not sure what this latter refers to, but it's probably not critical here-->\n\nThe availability of [[black powder]] to propel projectiles was a precursor to the development of the first solid rocket. Ninth Century [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Taoist]] [[Alchemy|alchemists]] discovered black powder in a search for the [[elixir of life]]; this accidental discovery led to [[fire arrow]]s which were the first rocket engines to leave the ground.\n\nIt is stated that \"the reactive forces of incendiaries were probably not applied to the propulsion of projectiles prior to the 13th century\". A turning point in rocket technology emerged with a short manuscript entitled ''Liber Ignium ad Comburendos Hostes'' (abbreviated as ''The Book of Fires''). The manuscript is composed of recipes for creating incendiary weapons from the mid-eighth to the end of the thirteenth centuries\u2014two of which are rockets.  The first recipe calls for one part of colophonium and sulfur added to six parts of saltpeter (potassium nitrate) dissolved in [[Lauraceae|laurel]] oil, then inserted into hollow wood and lit to \"fly away suddenly to whatever place you wish and burn up everything\".  The second recipe combines one pound of sulfur, two pounds of charcoal, and six pounds of saltpeter\u2014all finely powdered on a marble slab.  This powder mixture is packed firmly into a long and narrow case.  The introduction of saltpeter into pyrotechnic mixtures connected the shift from hurled [[Greek fire]] into self-propelled rocketry. .<ref>{{cite book|last1=Von Braun|last2= Ordway III|first1=Wernher |first2= Frederick I.|title=The Rockets' Red Glare|url=https://archive.org/details/rocketsredglare0000vonb|url-access=registration|date=1976|publisher=Anchor Press/ Doubleday|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=9780385078474|page=[https://archive.org/details/rocketsredglare0000vonb/page/5 5]}}</ref>\n\nArticles and books on the subject of rocketry appeared increasingly from the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.  In the sixteenth century, German military engineer Conrad Haas (1509\u20131576) wrote a manuscript which introduced the construction to multi-staged rockets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Von Braun|last2= Ordway III|first1=Wernher |first2= Frederick I.|title=The Rockets' Red Glare|url=https://archive.org/details/rocketsredglare0000vonb|url-access=registration|date=1976|publisher=Anchor Press/ Doubleday|location=Garden City, New York|isbn=9780385078474|page=[https://archive.org/details/rocketsredglare0000vonb/page/11 11]}}</ref>\n\nRocket engines were also brought in use by [[Tippu Sultan]], the king of Mysore. These rockets could be of various sizes, but usually consisted of a tube of soft hammered iron about {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1+1/2|-|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} diameter, closed at one end and strapped to a shaft of bamboo about {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=on}} long. The iron tube acted as a combustion chamber and contained well packed black powder propellant. A rocket carrying about one pound of powder could travel almost {{convert|1000|yd|m}}. These 'rockets', fitted with swords used to travel long distance, several meters above in air before coming down with swords edges facing the enemy. These rockets were used against British empire very effectively.\n\nSlow development of this technology continued up to the later 19th century, when Russian [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] first wrote about [[liquid rocket|liquid-fueled rocket engines]]. He was the first to develop the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]], though it was not published widely for some years.\n\nThe modern solid- and liquid-fueled engines became realities early in the 20th century, thanks to the American physicist [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]]. Goddard was the first to use a [[De Laval nozzle]] on a solid-propellant (gunpowder) rocket engine, doubling the thrust and increasing the efficiency by a factor of about twenty-five. This was the birth of the modern rocket engine. He calculated from his independently-derived rocket equation that a reasonably sized rocket, using solid fuel, could place a one-pound payload on the Moon. He began to use liquid propellants in 1921 and was the first to launch, in 1926, a liquid-propellant rocket. Goddard pioneered the use of the De Laval nozzle, lightweight propellant tanks, small light turbopumps, thrust vectoring, the smoothly-throttled liquid fuel engine, regenerative cooling, and curtain cooling.<ref name=Sutton/>{{rp|247\u2013266}}\n\nDuring the late 1930s, German scientists, such as [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Hellmuth Walter]], investigated installing liquid-fueled rockets in military aircraft ([[Heinkel He 112]], [[Heinkel He 111|He 111]], [[Heinkel He 176|He 176]] and [[Messerschmitt Me 163]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=Lutz Warsitz|title=The First Jet Pilot \u2013 The Story of German Test Pilot Erich Warsitz|edition=|publisher=Pen and Sword Ltd.|date=2009|ISBN=978-1-84415-818-8}} Includes von Braun's and Hellmuth Walter's experiments with rocket aircraft. [http://www.pen-and-sword.co.uk/?product_id=1762 English edition.]</ref>\n\nThe turbopump was employed by German scientists in World War II. Until then cooling the nozzle had been problematic, and the [[V-2 rocket|A4]] ballistic missile used dilute alcohol for the fuel, which reduced the combustion temperature sufficiently.\n\n[[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|Staged combustion]] (''\u0417\u0430\u043c\u043a\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0445\u0435\u043c\u0430'') was first proposed by [[Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev|Alexey Isaev]] in 1949. The first staged combustion engine was the S1.5400 used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev.<ref name=Sutton>{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George P.|title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines|date=2005|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Reston, Virginia}}</ref> About the same time (1959), [[Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kuznetsov|Nikolai Kuznetsov]] began work on the closed cycle engine [[NK-9]] for Korolev's orbital ICBM, GR-1. Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the [[NK-15]] and [[NK-33]] engines for the unsuccessful Lunar [[N1 rocket]].\n\nIn the West, the first laboratory staged-combustion test engine was built in Germany in 1963, by [[Ludwig Boelkow]].\n\nHydrogen peroxide / kerosene fueled engines such as the British [[Gamma (Rocket engine)|Gamma]] of the 1950s used a closed-cycle process (arguably not ''staged combustion'', but that's mostly a question of semantics) by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines ''before'' combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper. This gave the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, whilst avoiding the major engineering problems.\n\nLiquid hydrogen engines were first successfully developed in America, the [[RL-10]] engine first flew in 1962. Hydrogen engines were used as part of the [[Apollo program]]; the liquid hydrogen fuel giving a rather lower stage mass and thus reducing the overall size and cost of the vehicle.\n\nMost engines on one rocket flight was 44 set by NASA in 2016 on a [[Black Brant (rocket)|Black Brant]].<ref>https://www.space.com/33810-nasa-world-record-most-rocket-engines.html</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Comparison of orbital rocket engines]]\n*[[Jet damping]] an effect of the exhaust jet of a rocket that tends to slow a vehicle's rotation speed\n*[[Laser propulsion]]\n*[[Model rocket motor classification]] lettered engines\n*[[NERVA]] \u2013 [[NASA]]'s Nuclear Energy for Rocket Vehicle Applications, a US nuclear thermal rocket programme\n*[[Photon rocket]]\n*[[Project Prometheus]], NASA development of nuclear propulsion for long-duration spaceflight, begun in 2003\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Rocket engines}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071009153749/http://www.pwrengineering.com/articles/longterm.htm Designing for rocket engine life expectancy]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007070232/http://www.pwrengineering.com/articles/plume.htm Rocket Engine performance analysis with Plume Spectrometry]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071009151907/http://www.pwrengineering.com/articles/heart.htm Rocket Engine Thrust Chamber technical article]\n*[http://www.fxsolver.com/browse/formulas/Net+Thrust+of+a+Rocket+Engine Net Thrust of a Rocket Engine calculator]\n*[http://www.lpre.de/resources/software/RPA_en.htm Design Tool for Liquid Rocket Engine Thermodynamic Analysis]\n*[http://www.braeunig.us/space/propuls.htm Rocket & Space Technology - Rocket Propulsion]\n*[http://www.erichwarsitz.com/ The official website of test pilot Erich Warsitz (world's first jet pilot) which includes videos of the Heinkel He 112 fitted with von Braun's and Hellmuth Walter's rocket engines (as well as the He 111 with ATO Units)]\n\n{{Rocket engines}}\n{{Aircraft gas turbine engine components}}\n{{Heat engines|state=uncollapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rocket Engine}}\n[[Category:Spacecraft components]]\n[[Category:Aerospace engineering]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines| ]]\n", "name_user": "JustinTime55", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Short description: we do not call rockets jet engines", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine"}
