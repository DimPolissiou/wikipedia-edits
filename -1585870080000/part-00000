Some are told in the traditional manner; with a beginning, middle and end; others are short staccato bursts of poetic energy, gorgeous in their use of language and satisfying as a good story should be... None is disappointing. Each story is a good read, and the variety of construction adds to the interest and encourages further exploration ... For your average Kiwi, it adds an exotic touch and extra interest ... Some stories make you wonder where they come from, how they arrived in the author\u2019s imagination, but they \u2018re so good you\u2019d be pleased they did. Pual Brooks - Midweek\n\n\u201cMoisa doesn\u2019t disappoint. His stories are wide-ranging, both in subject matter and character portrayal, and his wit and his perception of human frailty reflect a life lived in several manifestations. This collection covers stories from New Zealand scenes as well as echoing the six years spent as a child in Cyprus in the late 1950s and as a young man in 1973 and 1974. ... Several of Moisa\u2019s stories have the surprise ending which is imperative for a good story, and this is one of the strengths and delights of his book ...

I recommend it.\" <ref>Doug Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 14 July 2016.</ref>\nThe Hour of the Grey Wolf is a crime story ... in many ways it defies the genre. It is literary fiction as well, experimental in form, so experimental that, simply linked together with logic, the parts should not work together to form that coherent whole. And yet they do. ... a compelling page turner, a classic whodunit. ... I kept turning the pages and am certain other readers will too.

The cleverly devised plot will keep you intrigued right through to the end ... For those of us familiar with Wellington during the 1950s\u2019s \u201cOvercast Sunday\u201d will evoke a few memories of a time and lifestyle that no longer exists. The title itself belongs to a song, a type of blues music in keeping with the sentiments of love, joy and sorrow and particularly poignant for immigrants far from their homeland. The book gives examples of the hardships, hopes and dashed dreams which marked their lives and the reasons for moving to New Zealand. Like all immigrants they found it to be no promised land and this informs and colours the book as various incidents are woven into the plot ...\" Marion Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 17 November 2016.\n\n\"This is not your average crime novel, in fact, although the story features a crime- a murder \u2013 it is a story of a place, a time, and the characters who converge on both.

Chris Moisa has written a fine story, crafted in such a way that may irritate and impatient reader, but rich in knowledge and understanding of the community in which the book is centred, and the forces that bring everything together at that point.\nThe reader learns a lot and becomes intimately engaged with each character, their lives laid bare for us in the book\u2019s unusual configuration. \nThe author captured the time, the economics, politics and social ambiance of New Zealand in 1950, with the Greek community the focus of his attention.\nThe story is not for me to tell but I really enjoyed it. The book is not laid out in a traditional format, and what I see it has challenged the odd critic. I found it enhanced the yarn Chris tells.

Some are told in the traditional manner; with a beginning, middle and end; others are short staccato bursts of poetic energy, gorgeous in their use of language and satisfying as a good story should be... None is disappointing. Each story is a good read, and the variety of construction adds to the interest and encourages further exploration ... For your average Kiwi, it adds an exotic touch and extra interest ... Some stories make you wonder where they come from, how they arrived in the author\u2019s imagination, but they \u2018re so good you\u2019d be pleased they did. Pual Brooks - Midweek\n\n\u201cMoisa doesn\u2019t disappoint. His stories are wide-ranging, both in subject matter and character portrayal, and his wit and his perception of human frailty reflect a life lived in several manifestations. This collection covers stories from New Zealand scenes as well as echoing the six years spent as a child in Cyprus in the late 1950s and as a young man in 1973 and 1974. ... Several of Moisa\u2019s stories have the surprise ending which is imperative for a good story, and this is one of the strengths and delights of his book ... Blood and Koka Kola ... is a very interesting, insightful and appealing collection of short stories...\u201d Michael O'Leary- Landfall\n\n==Novel==\n* The Hour of the Grey Wolf, Christodoulos Moisa 2016, {{ISBN|978-1519445988}} \nCRITICS COMMENTS:\"The writing style can best be described as erudite with allusions to historical and Biblical events. In less fluent writer, these descriptions would slow the story down but this is not the case ... The book remains fast moving, while giving the reader the satisfaction of having read a novel of substance and at the same time enjoying trying to second guess the mystery murder element. I recommend it.\" <ref>Doug Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 14 July 2016.</ref>\nThe Hour of the Grey Wolf is a crime story ... in many ways it defies the genre. It is literary fiction as well, experimental in form, so experimental that, simply linked together with logic, the parts should not work together to form that coherent whole. And yet they do. ... a compelling page turner, a classic whodunit. ... I kept turning the pages and am certain other readers will too. The overall effect of The Hour of the Grey Wolf cannot be denied: the setting and characters are still resonating with me ...\" <ref>Antony Millen \u2013 Crime Watch - Investigating crime fiction from a Kiwi perspective April 2016</ref>\n\n* Overcast Sunday, Christodoulos Moisa 2016,{{ISBN|9781523354214}}\nCRITICS COMMENTS: \"While the main story is sufficient to hold your interest, it is embellished with a cultural richness that sets it apart from just another \u201cWho-dunnit\u201c ... The cleverly devised plot will keep you intrigued right through to the end ... For those of us familiar with Wellington during the 1950s\u2019s \u201cOvercast Sunday\u201d will evoke a few memories of a time and lifestyle that no longer exists. The title itself belongs to a song, a type of blues music in keeping with the sentiments of love, joy and sorrow and particularly poignant for immigrants far from their homeland. The book gives examples of the hardships, hopes and dashed dreams which marked their lives and the reasons for moving to New Zealand. Like all immigrants they found it to be no promised land and this informs and colours the book as various incidents are woven into the plot ...\" Marion Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 17 November 2016.\n\n\"This is not your average crime novel, in fact, although the story features a crime- a murder \u2013 it is a story of a place, a time, and the characters who converge on both. It is about people and the stories they bring to the Greek community in Wellington 1950. The story opens with ... Chris Moisa has written a fine story, crafted in such a way that may irritate and impatient reader, but rich in knowledge and understanding of the community in which the book is centred, and the forces that bring everything together at that point.\nThe reader learns a lot and becomes intimately engaged with each character, their lives laid bare for us in the book\u2019s unusual configuration. \nThe author captured the time, the economics, politics and social ambiance of New Zealand in 1950, with the Greek community the focus of his attention.\nThe story is not for me to tell but I really enjoyed it. The book is not laid out in a traditional format, and what I see it has challenged the odd critic. I found it enhanced the yarn Chris tells.  This latest book is a valuable addition to the repertoire of a superb writer.\n<ref name=\"Paul Brooks\">{{cite news|last1=Moisa|first1=Christodooulos|title=Crime Story brings 1950s NZ to life.|agency=Midweek|publisher=NZ Herald|date=17 May 2017}}</ref> Paul Brooks\nMidweek - Herald - 17 May 2017\n\n*Wolves in Dogs Clothing, Christodoulos Moisa 2017,{{ISBN|978-1548977368}}\nCRITICS COMMENTS: \"The novel is set in Cyprus during the coup and the Turkish invasion in 1974 and the major plot based on a series of brutal murders is supported by a number of equally intriguing sub plots .... the writing style is a combination thriller and interesting snippets about history, politics, society and mythology. It is a style that I appreciate. I learn while I am kept enthralled by the action. ... the Turkish invasion, which Chris although from a Greek background, writes about with admirable balance, and gives another depth to the novel. Chris ... writes with an assuredness of someone who is in control of his craft ...\" Doug Davidson - River City (23 November 2017)\n\n\"... has done his research and knows the time and place of which he writes, but his own writing skills give honesty to the characters and how they live their lives. The conversations are real, without being too mundane, and how they look, dress and act completes a populated word landscape too real to be complete fiction.\" Paul Brooks - Midweek / New Zealand Herald (10 January 2018)\n\nCurrently Moisa lives in [[Whanganui]] and works as a novelist, artist, photographer.

He performed his distinct yet Baxteresque performance poetry at all of the local poetry performance venues: the Arc Caf\u00e9, the Port Chalmers Hotel (The Tunnel), and the Dunedin Public Library. While preferring the orality of performance, a few poems were published in student magazine, The [[Critic (magazine)|''Critic'']]. His poems frequently interlace the gravity of biblical imagery with the banalities of modern existence, forcing their confrontation and overcoming any simple binary interpretations.

In Baxter's later poetry, Dennison finds that Baxter's use of te ao M\u0101ori is not for the purposes of setting up an opposition to P\u0101keh\u0101 culture, nor is it a simple model for P\u0101keh\u0101 culture to emulate, but it functions to inspire a rethinking of what it is to be P\u0101keh\u0101. Instead of being defined by opposition or assimilation, Dennison's thesis is that Baxter was suggesting a reconfiguration of P\u0101keh\u0101 identity, one shaped by the tuakana-teina (elder brother-younger brother) familial relationship.\n\n==Doctoral research==\nIn April 2007, Dennison was awarded the highest value scholarship from the New Zealand Tertiary Education Commission.  The scholarships awarded by the New Zealand Government were embroiled in controversy, when Opposition MPs criticised the award of $96,000 for the study of [[bogan]]s.
