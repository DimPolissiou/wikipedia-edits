Peru was the first to use the helmet for the [[Peruvian Army]] when some helmets were shipped to the country in the 1870s, but during the [[War of the Pacific]] the 6th Infantry Regiment \"Chacabuco\" of the [[Chilean Army]] became the first Chilean military unit to use them when its personnel used the helmets\u2014which were seized from the Peruvians\u2014in their red French-inspired uniforms.<ref>http://www.pickelhauben.net/articles/latin_America.html{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> These sported the Imperial German eagles but in the 1900s the eagles were replaced by the national emblems of the countries that used them.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 (\u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433, \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tsarist Russian Pickelhauben, with detachable plumes, mid 19th century]]\n\nThe Russian version initially had a horsehair plume fitted to the end of the spike, but this was later discarded in some units. The Russian spike was topped with a grenade motif. At the beginning of the [[Crimean War]], such helmets were common among infantry and grenadiers, but soon fell out of place in favour of the [[Battledress|fatigue]] cap. After 1862 the spiked helmet ceased to be generally worn by the Russian Army, although it was retained until 1914 by the Cuirassier regiments of the Imperial Guard and the Gendarmerie. The Russians prolonged the history of the pointed military headgear with their own cloth [[Budenovka]] in the early 20th century.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Derivatives==\nIn 1847, the [[Household Cavalry]], along with British [[dragoon]]s and [[dragoon guards]], adopted a helmet which was a hybrid between the Pickelhaube and the traditional [[dragoon helmet]] which it replaced. This \"Albert Pattern\" helmet was named after [[Albert, Prince Consort]] who took a keen interest in military uniforms, and featured a falling horsehair plume which could be removed when on campaign. It was adopted by other [[heavy cavalry]] regiments across the [[British Empire]] and remains in ceremonial use.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Stephen |date=2015 |title=Those Terrible Grey Horses: An Illustrated History of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards |url= |location= |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page=82 |isbn=978-1472810625 }}</ref> The Pickelhaube also influenced the design of the British army [[Pith helmet#Home Service helmet|Home Service helmet]], as well as the [[custodian helmet]] still worn by police in England and Wales.<ref>Major R. M. Barnes, p. 257, \"A History of the Regiments & Uniforms of the British Army, First Sphere Books, 1972.</ref> The linkage between Pickelhaube and Home Service helmet was however not a direct one, since the British headdress was higher, had only a small spike and was made of stiffened cloth over a cork framework, instead of leather. Both the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] wore helmets of the British pattern for full dress between 1881 and 1902.\n\n==Design==\nThe basic Pickelhaube was made of hardened ([[Boiled leather|boiled]]) leather, given a glossy-black finish, and reinforced with metal trim (usually plated with gold or silver for officers) that included a metal spike at the crown. Early versions had a high crown, but the height gradually was reduced and the helmet became more fitted in form, in a continuing process of weight-reduction and cost-saving. In 1867 a further attempt at weight reduction by removing the metal binding of the front peak, and the metal reinforcing band on the rear of the crown (which also concealed the stitched rear seam of the leather crown), did not prove successful.\n\nThe version of the Pickelhaube worn by Prussian artillery units employed a ball-shaped finial rather than the pointed spike, a modification ordered in 1844 because of injuries to horses and damage to equipment caused by the latter.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ulrich|last=Herr|pages=38-39|title=The Gerrman Artillery from 1871 to 1914|ISBN=978-3-902526-80-9}}</ref> Prior to the outbreak of World War I in 1914 detachable black or white plumes were worn with the Pickelhaube in full dress by German generals, staff officers, dragoon regiments, infantry of the [[Prussian Guard]] and a number of line infantry regiments as a special distinction. This was achieved by unscrewing the spike (a feature of all Pickelhauben regardless of whether they bore a plume) and replacing it with a tall metal plume-holder known as a ''trichter''. For musicians of these units, and also for Bavarian Artillery and an entire cavalry regiment of the Saxon Guard, this plume was red.\n\nAside from the spike finial, perhaps the most recognizable feature of the Pickelhaube was the ornamental front plate, which denoted the regiment's province or state.  The most common plate design consisted of a large, spread-winged eagle, the emblem used by Prussia. Different plate designs were used by Bavaria, W\u00fcrttemberg, Baden, and the other German states. The Russians used the traditional [[double-headed eagle]].\n\nGerman military Pickelhauben also mounted two round, colored [[Cockade#Cockades of the European military|cockades]] behind the chinstraps attached to the sides of the helmet. The right cockade, the national cockade, was red, black and white. The left cockade was used to denote the state of the soldier (Prussia: black and white; Bavaria: white and blue; etc.).\n\nAll-metal versions of the Pickelhaube were worn mainly by [[cuirassier]]s, and often appear in portraits of high-ranking military and political figures (such as [[Otto von Bismarck]], pictured above). These helmets were sometimes referred to as lobster-tail helmets, due to their distinctive articulated neck guard. The design of these is based on cavalry helmets in common use since the 16th century, but with some features taken from the leather helmets. The version worn by the [[Gardes du Corps (Prussia)|Prussian Gardes du Corps]] was of [[tombac]] (copper and zinc alloy) with silver mountings. That worn by the cuirassiers of the line since 1842 was of polished steel with brass mountings,\n\n==Cover==\n[[File:Pickelhaube mit \u00dcberzug.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1892 \u00dcberzug on 1895 Pickelhaube]]\n[[File:Pickelhaube US Marines corps, casque \u00e0 pointe des marines am\u00e9ricains.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. Marine Corps helmet of similar form, 1881\u20131902]]\nIn 1892, a light brown cloth helmet cover, the M1892 \u00dcberzug, became standard issue for all Pickelhauben for manoeuvres and active service. The \u00dcberzug was intended to protect the helmet from dirt and reduce its combat visibility, as the brass and silver fittings on the Pickelhaube proved to be highly reflective.<ref>''First World War'', Willmott, H. P., [[Dorling Kindersley]], 2003, p. 59.</ref> Regimental numbers were sewn or stenciled in red (green from August 1914) onto the front of the cover, other than in units of the Prussian Guards, which never carried regimental numbers or other adornments on the \u00dcberzug. With exposure to the sun, the \u00dcberzug faded into a tan shade. In October 1916 the colour was changed to [[feldgrau]] (field grey), although by that date the plain metal [[Stahlhelm]] was standard issue for most troops.\n\n==In World War I==\nAll helmets produced for the infantry before and during 1914 were made of leather. As the war progressed, Germany's leather stockpiles dwindled. After extensive imports from South America, particularly Argentina, the German government began producing [[ersatz]] Pickelhauben made of other materials. In 1915, some Pickelhauben began to be made from thin sheet steel. However, the German high command needed to produce an even greater number of helmets, leading to the usage of pressurized felt and even paper to construct Pickelhauben.  The Pickelhaube was discontinued in 1916.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://militaryhistorynow.com/2012/05/27/a-brief-history-of-german-army-helmets/|title=Get the Point? \u2014 A Brief History of Germany\u2019s \u2018Pickelhaube\u2019 Spiked Helmet|date=2012-05-27|work=MilitaryHistoryNow.com|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112075930/http://militaryhistorynow.com/2012/05/27/a-brief-history-of-german-army-helmets/|archivedate=2017-11-12}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early months of [[World War I]], it was soon discovered that the Pickelhaube did not measure up to the demanding conditions of trench warfare. The leather helmets offered little protection against shell fragments and shrapnel and the conspicuous spike made its wearer a target. These shortcomings, combined with material shortages, led to the introduction of the simplified model 1915 helmet described above, with a detachable spike. In September 1915 it was ordered that the new helmets were to be worn without spikes when in the front line.<ref>''World War One German Army'', Stephen Bull, pp. 71\u201373.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1916, the Pickelhaube was slowly replaced by a new German steel helmet (the ''[[Stahlhelm#M1916 and M1917|Stahlhelm]]'') intended to offer greater head protection from shell fragments. The German steel helmet decreased German head wound fatalities by 70%.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} After the adoption of the Stahlhelm, the Pickelhaube was reduced to limited ceremonial wear by senior officers away from the war zones; plus the ''Leibgendarmerie S.M. des Kaisers'' whose role as an Imperial/Royal escort led them to retain peacetime full dress throughout the war.<ref>Charles Woolley, p. 368, ''Uniforms and Equipment of the Imperial German Army 1900\u20131918'', {{ISBN|0-7643-0935-8}}.</ref><ref>Andrew Mollo, p. 191, ''Army Uniforms of World War I'', {{ISBN|0-668-04479-9}}.</ref> With the collapse of the [[German Empire]] in 1918, the Pickelhaube ceased to be part of the military uniform, and even the police adopted [[shako]]s of a [[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]] style. In modified forms the new Stahlhelm helmet would continue to be worn by German troops into [[World War II]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R11105, Kaiser Wilhelm II., August v.

[[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] adopted it by 1849, [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] by 1870, and in 1887, the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] was the last German state to adopt the Pickelhaube (since the [[Napoleonic Wars]], they had had their own design of helmet, called the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Raupenhelm|de}}'', a [[Tarleton helmet]]).

Peru was the first to use the helmet for the [[Peruvian Army]] when some helmets were shipped to the country in the 1870s, but during the [[War of the Pacific]] the 6th Infantry Regiment \"Chacabuco\" of the [[Chilean Army]] became the first Chilean military unit to use them when its personnel used the helmets\u2014which were seized from the Peruvians\u2014in their red French-inspired uniforms.<ref>http://www.pickelhauben.net/articles/latin_America.html{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> These sported the Imperial German eagles but in the 1900s the eagles were replaced by the national emblems of the countries that used them.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 (\u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433, \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tsarist Russian Pickelhauben, with detachable plumes, mid 19th century]]\n\nThe Russian version initially had a horsehair plume fitted to the end of the spike, but this was later discarded in some units. The Russian spike was topped with a grenade motif. At the beginning of the [[Crimean War]], such helmets were common among infantry and grenadiers, but soon fell out of place in favour of the [[Battledress|fatigue]] cap. After 1862 the spiked helmet ceased to be generally worn by the Russian Army, although it was retained until 1914 by the Cuirassier regiments of the Imperial Guard and the Gendarmerie. The Russians prolonged the history of the pointed military headgear with their own cloth [[Budenovka]] in the early 20th century.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Derivatives==\nIn 1847, the [[Household Cavalry]], along with British [[dragoon]]s and [[dragoon guards]], adopted a helmet which was a hybrid between the Pickelhaube and the traditional [[dragoon helmet]] which it replaced. This \"Albert Pattern\" helmet was named after [[Albert, Prince Consort]] who took a keen interest in military uniforms, and featured a falling horsehair plume which could be removed when on campaign. It was adopted by other [[heavy cavalry]] regiments across the [[British Empire]] and remains in ceremonial use.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Stephen |date=2015 |title=Those Terrible Grey Horses: An Illustrated History of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards |url= |location= |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page=82 |isbn=978-1472810625 }}</ref> The Pickelhaube also influenced the design of the British army [[Pith helmet#Home Service helmet|Home Service helmet]], as well as the [[custodian helmet]] still worn by police in England and Wales.<ref>Major R. M. Barnes, p. 257, \"A History of the Regiments & Uniforms of the British Army, First Sphere Books, 1972.</ref> The linkage between Pickelhaube and Home Service helmet was however not a direct one, since the British headdress was higher, had only a small spike and was made of stiffened cloth over a cork framework, instead of leather. Both the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] wore helmets of the British pattern for full dress between 1881 and 1902.\n\n==Design==\nThe basic Pickelhaube was made of hardened ([[Boiled leather|boiled]]) leather, given a glossy-black finish, and reinforced with metal trim (usually plated with gold or silver for officers) that included a metal spike at the crown. Early versions had a high crown, but the height gradually was reduced and the helmet became more fitted in form, in a continuing process of weight-reduction and cost-saving. In 1867 a further attempt at weight reduction by removing the metal binding of the front peak, and the metal reinforcing band on the rear of the crown (which also concealed the stitched rear seam of the leather crown), did not prove successful.\n\nThe version of the Pickelhaube worn by Prussian artillery units employed a ball-shaped finial rather than the pointed spike, a modification ordered in 1844 because of injuries to horses and damage to equipment caused by the latter.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ulrich|last=Herr|pages=38-39|title=The Gerrman Artillery from 1871 to 1914|ISBN=978-3-902526-80-9}}</ref> Prior to the outbreak of World War I in 1914 detachable black or white plumes were worn with the Pickelhaube in full dress by German generals, staff officers, dragoon regiments, infantry of the [[Prussian Guard]] and a number of line infantry regiments as a special distinction. This was achieved by unscrewing the spike (a feature of all Pickelhauben regardless of whether they bore a plume) and replacing it with a tall metal plume-holder known as a ''trichter''. For musicians of these units, and also for Bavarian Artillery and an entire cavalry regiment of the Saxon Guard, this plume was red.\n\nAside from the spike finial, perhaps the most recognizable feature of the Pickelhaube was the ornamental front plate, which denoted the regiment's province or state.  The most common plate design consisted of a large, spread-winged eagle, the emblem used by Prussia. Different plate designs were used by Bavaria, W\u00fcrttemberg, Baden, and the other German states. The Russians used the traditional [[double-headed eagle]].\n\nGerman military Pickelhauben also mounted two round, colored [[Cockade#Cockades of the European military|cockades]] behind the chinstraps attached to the sides of the helmet. The right cockade, the national cockade, was red, black and white. The left cockade was used to denote the state of the soldier (Prussia: black and white; Bavaria: white and blue; etc.).\n\nAll-metal versions of the Pickelhaube were worn mainly by [[cuirassier]]s, and often appear in portraits of high-ranking military and political figures (such as [[Otto von Bismarck]], pictured above). These helmets were sometimes referred to as lobster-tail helmets, due to their distinctive articulated neck guard. The design of these is based on cavalry helmets in common use since the 16th century, but with some features taken from the leather helmets. The version worn by the [[Gardes du Corps (Prussia)|Prussian Gardes du Corps]] was of [[tombac]] (copper and zinc alloy) with silver mountings. That worn by the cuirassiers of the line since 1842 was of polished steel with brass mountings,\n\n==Cover==\n[[File:Pickelhaube mit \u00dcberzug.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1892 \u00dcberzug on 1895 Pickelhaube]]\n[[File:Pickelhaube US Marines corps, casque \u00e0 pointe des marines am\u00e9ricains.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. Marine Corps helmet of similar form, 1881\u20131902]]\nIn 1892, a light brown cloth helmet cover, the M1892 \u00dcberzug, became standard issue for all Pickelhauben for manoeuvres and active service. The \u00dcberzug was intended to protect the helmet from dirt and reduce its combat visibility, as the brass and silver fittings on the Pickelhaube proved to be highly reflective.<ref>''First World War'', Willmott, H. P., [[Dorling Kindersley]], 2003, p. 59.</ref> Regimental numbers were sewn or stenciled in red (green from August 1914) onto the front of the cover, other than in units of the Prussian Guards, which never carried regimental numbers or other adornments on the \u00dcberzug. With exposure to the sun, the \u00dcberzug faded into a tan shade. In October 1916 the colour was changed to [[feldgrau]] (field grey), although by that date the plain metal [[Stahlhelm]] was standard issue for most troops.\n\n==In World War I==\nAll helmets produced for the infantry before and during 1914 were made of leather. As the war progressed, Germany's leather stockpiles dwindled. After extensive imports from South America, particularly Argentina, the German government began producing [[ersatz]] Pickelhauben made of other materials. In 1915, some Pickelhauben began to be made from thin sheet steel. However, the German high command needed to produce an even greater number of helmets, leading to the usage of pressurized felt and even paper to construct Pickelhauben.  The Pickelhaube was discontinued in 1916.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://militaryhistorynow.com/2012/05/27/a-brief-history-of-german-army-helmets/|title=Get the Point? \u2014 A Brief History of Germany\u2019s \u2018Pickelhaube\u2019 Spiked Helmet|date=2012-05-27|work=MilitaryHistoryNow.com|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112075930/http://militaryhistorynow.com/2012/05/27/a-brief-history-of-german-army-helmets/|archivedate=2017-11-12}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early months of [[World War I]], it was soon discovered that the Pickelhaube did not measure up to the demanding conditions of trench warfare. The leather helmets offered little protection against shell fragments and shrapnel and the conspicuous spike made its wearer a target. These shortcomings, combined with material shortages, led to the introduction of the simplified model 1915 helmet described above, with a detachable spike. In September 1915 it was ordered that the new helmets were to be worn without spikes when in the front line.<ref>''World War One German Army'', Stephen Bull, pp. 71\u201373.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1916, the Pickelhaube was slowly replaced by a new German steel helmet (the ''[[Stahlhelm#M1916 and M1917|Stahlhelm]]'') intended to offer greater head protection from shell fragments. The German steel helmet decreased German head wound fatalities by 70%.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} After the adoption of the Stahlhelm, the Pickelhaube was reduced to limited ceremonial wear by senior officers away from the war zones; plus the ''Leibgendarmerie S.M. des Kaisers'' whose role as an Imperial/Royal escort led them to retain peacetime full dress throughout the war.<ref>Charles Woolley, p. 368, ''Uniforms and Equipment of the Imperial German Army 1900\u20131918'', {{ISBN|0-7643-0935-8}}.</ref><ref>Andrew Mollo, p. 191, ''Army Uniforms of World War I'', {{ISBN|0-668-04479-9}}.</ref> With the collapse of the [[German Empire]] in 1918, the Pickelhaube ceased to be part of the military uniform, and even the police adopted [[shako]]s of a [[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]] style.

Borderline patients are severely impulsive and their attempts to alleviate the agony are often very destructive or self-destructive. Suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, eating disorders ([[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia nervosa]]), self-harm (cutting, overdosing, etc.), compulsive spending, gambling, sex addiction, violent and aggressive behaviour, sexual promiscuity and deviant sexual behaviours, are desperate attempts to escape. The intrapsychic pain experienced by those diagnosed with BPD has been studied and compared to normal healthy controls and to others suffering from [[major depression]], bipolar disorder, [[substance use disorder]], schizophrenia, other [[personality disorder]]s, and a range of other conditions. The excruciatingly painful inner experience of the borderline patient is both unique and perplexing. In clinical populations, the rate of suicide of patients with borderline personality disorder is estimated to be 10%, a rate far greater than that in the general population and still considerably greater than for patients with [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]]. However, since 60\u201370% of patients with borderline personality disorder make suicide attempts; suicide attempts are far more frequent than completed suicides in patients with borderline personality disorder.<ref name=Oldham>{{cite journal|last1=Oldham|first1=JM|title=Borderline Personality Disorder and Suicidality|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=2006|volume=163|issue=1|pages=20\u201326|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.1.20|pmid=16390884}}</ref>\n\nThe intense [[dysphoria|dysphoric]] states which patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) endure on a regular basis distinguishes them from those suffering from other personality disorders, [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], and virtually all known Axis I and Axis II conditions. In a study, twenty-five dysphoric states (mostly affects) were found to be significantly more common among borderline patients than controls. Twenty-five other dysphoric states (mostly cognitions) were found to be both significantly more common among borderline patients than controls and highly specific to borderline personality disorder. These states tended to fall into one of four clusters: (1) extreme feelings, (2) destructiveness or self-destructiveness, (3) fragmentation or \"identitylessness\", and (4) victimization. In addition, three of the 25 more-specific states (feeling betrayed, like hurting myself, and completely out of control), when occurring together, were particularly strongly associated with the borderline diagnosis. Equally important, overall mean Dysphoric Affect Scale scores correctly distinguished borderline personality disorder from other personality disorders and mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, major depression, and anxiety disorders in 84% of the subjects. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that the subjective pain of borderline patients may be both more pervasive and more multifaceted than previously recognized, and that the overall \u201camplitude\u201d (or intensity) of this pain may be a particularly good marker for the borderline diagnosis.<ref name=BPDPain>{{cite journal|last1=Zanarini|first1=MC|last2=Gunderson|first2=JG|authorlink2=John G.

Borderline patients are severely impulsive and their attempts to alleviate the agony are often very destructive or self-destructive. Suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, eating disorders ([[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia nervosa]]), self-harm (cutting, overdosing, etc.), compulsive spending, gambling, sex addiction, violent and aggressive behaviour, sexual promiscuity and deviant sexual behaviours, are desperate attempts to escape. The intrapsychic pain experienced by those diagnosed with BPD has been studied and compared to normal healthy controls and to others suffering from [[major depression]], bipolar disorder, [[substance use disorder]], schizophrenia, other [[personality disorder]]s, and a range of other conditions. The excruciatingly painful inner experience of the borderline patient is both unique and perplexing. In clinical populations, the rate of suicide of patients with borderline personality disorder is estimated to be 10%, a rate far greater than that in the general population and still considerably greater than for patients with [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]]. However, since 60\u201370% of patients with borderline personality disorder make suicide attempts; suicide attempts are far more frequent than completed suicides in patients with borderline personality disorder.<ref name=Oldham>{{cite journal|last1=Oldham|first1=JM|title=Borderline Personality Disorder and Suicidality|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=2006|volume=163|issue=1|pages=20\u201326|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.1.20|pmid=16390884}}</ref>\n\nThe intense [[dysphoria|dysphoric]] states which patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) endure on a regular basis distinguishes them from those suffering from other personality disorders, [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], and virtually all known Axis I and Axis II conditions. In a study, twenty-five dysphoric states (mostly affects) were found to be significantly more common among borderline patients than controls. Twenty-five other dysphoric states (mostly cognitions) were found to be both significantly more common among borderline patients than controls and highly specific to borderline personality disorder. These states tended to fall into one of four clusters: (1) extreme feelings, (2) destructiveness or self-destructiveness, (3) fragmentation or \"identitylessness\", and (4) victimization. In addition, three of the 25 more-specific states (feeling betrayed, like hurting myself, and completely out of control), when occurring together, were particularly strongly associated with the borderline diagnosis. Equally important, overall mean Dysphoric Affect Scale scores correctly distinguished borderline personality disorder from other personality disorders and mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, major depression, and anxiety disorders in 84% of the subjects. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that the subjective pain of borderline patients may be both more pervasive and more multifaceted than previously recognized, and that the overall \u201camplitude\u201d (or intensity) of this pain may be a particularly good marker for the borderline diagnosis.<ref name=BPDPain>{{cite journal|last1=Zanarini|first1=MC|last2=Gunderson|first2=JG|authorlink2=John G.
