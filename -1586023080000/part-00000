It is unknown if the YAHS grounds held any particular special, spiritual, or economic significance for the Wiradjuri people.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n=== British invasion and settlement ===\nWhat is today the [[Narrandera]] area was first invaded by European (mainly Irish) squatters during 1832-33. The Wiradjuri people who lived in this area are historically referred to as the Narrungdera. However, it is unknown if this is the correct name for these people. This invasion precipitated a war with the Narrungdera where the settlers were driven off their runs on several occasions throughout the rest of the 1830s and early 1840s before war and disease significantly reduced the Narrungdera population. However, they did not submit. Instead, they began moving throughout their lands keeping what tradition they could alive while also communicating and working for some of the friendlier settlers.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1>Gammage, 1986.</ref>{{rp|29-37}}\n\nThe Yonco run settled during this time by Thomas Small was originally the closest to what became the North Yanko headstation. During the frontier wars it was attacked several times, but it appears to have been one of the runs most persistently kept occupied. However, Small was defeated by these attacks and sold the property to James Thorn, perhaps as early as 1839-1840, who moved the headstation to the North Yanco area.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|29-37}}\n\nIn 1849 John Peter brought North Yanco from the Thorns. He appears to have had a good rapport with the Narrungdera or Wiradjuri as he employed around 50 to break in horses during the 1850s. At this time the region was experiencing a plague and the Narrungdera could break in up to 700 a year. In 1858 Peter sold the property to Alexander McNeil. Both Peter ad McNeil focused on breeding to improve their fleeces, and ultimately the prices of their wool, throughout their ownerships.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|42, 47, 53, 229}}\n\nThe North Yanco headstation was likely moved to its current (or long-term) location in 1870 after the terrible floods of that year forced pastoralists to re-evaluate their station infrastructure. This location appears to have been a good choice as during recent flooding (early 2000s) the main school centre has avoided being flooded.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|61}}\n\nBy 1881 North Yanco Station was owned by J. H. Douglas Esq. the local member for the district. It comprised around 95,000 acres and had a river frontage of 14 miles with an average depth back from the river of 25 miles. It stocked about 105,000 sheep and was known for the high quality of its wool. The gothic style homestead appears to have been located in the vicinity of the modern YAHS school complex. It was known as the \"the most perfect in this part of the district\" and featured a large garden, several acres in size. Fruit, vegetables, and flowers were grown in the garden which was watered by a wind-powered water lifter - it is likely that this piped water from the Murrumbidgee. Headstation complexes at this time in the district had become small villages with a variety of buildings and gardens and it appears North Yanco was no exception.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref>''[[Australian Town and Country Journal]]'', 23 April 1881, p24.</ref><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|79-80}}\n\nJames Henry Douglass was still owner in 1890 during the shearer's strikes, when the station had a board of 46 men and was worked by shearers from the union.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|94}}\n\n====Sir Samuel McCaughey's ownership of North Yanco and the North Yanco Irrigation Scheme (1899-1919/1920)==== \n[[File:Sir Samuel McCaughey's residence.jpg|thumb|left|[[Samuel McCaughey|Sir Samuel McCaughey]]'s residence, pictured in 1939, that now forms part of the school's facilities.]]\nSir [[Samuel McCaughey]] was born at Tullyneuh, near Ballymena in North Ireland on 1 July 1835. He was the eldest son of Francis and Eliza (nee Wilson) McCaughey. His father was a farmer and merchant and once he finished school he joined his father's linen business, where he learnt accounting and office management, while also working on the farm. His uncle [[Charles Wilson (Australian politician)|Charles Wilson]] convinced him to immigrate to Australia and he arrived in [[Melbourne]] in April 1856 to work on one of the properties ([[Kewell, Victoria|Kewell]]) owned by his other uncles John and Samuel (the Wilson Brothers) near [[Horsham, Victoria|Horsham]]. Starting as a general station hand he was appointed overseer two years later where he thrived due to his thrift, genial Irish humour, and kindness.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6>ADB</ref><ref name=nswshr-2021-2>Kelly, 1988</ref>{{rp|52}}\n \nBy 1860 he was able to convince his relations to back his purchase of a third share of Coonong, a 42,000 acre (16,997 ha) property near [[Urana]] in the [[Riverina]], in partnership with [[David Wilson (barrister)|David Wilson]] and John Cochrane. They initially suffered setbacks due to a lack of water, which perhaps encouraged McCaughey's interest in irrigation later in his life, but he persisted with the property, despite the withdrawing of his partners, which left him as sole owner in 1864. To solve his water problems McCaughey with his uncle Samuel Wilson deepened the Yanco Creek cutting and built dams. When he became partner in 1860 McCaughey also founded his sheep stud by purchasing old ewes descended from Tasmanian pure Saxon merinos from James Cochrane of Widegewa. From this time, he continued to improve the stud's quality by purchasing quality stock and sparing no expense in fencing and subdividing his paddocks.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/>\n\nMcCaughey's water conservation and sheep breeding schemes proved a success and he acquired the Singorimba and Goolgumbla properties later in the 1860s (or in 1870) and by 1872 held 137,000 acres (55,443 ha). In 1874 he brought his brother David (1848-1899) out to Australia to assist in the management of his properties. In 1881 he acquired [[Coree, New South Wales|Coree]], Toorale, and Dunlop from his uncle Samuel Wilson. However, he continued to live at Coonong and in 1876 built a large homestead with a garden and lake.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2/>{{rp|54}} \n\nBy the 1890s McCaughey had developed a keen interest in water conservation and he attempted to get more water for Coonong through additional dams on Colombo Creek or raising the heights of three dams on Yanko Creek in 1896. To undertake this work he brought over Irish workers who were used to wet and boggy working conditions. This act infuriated six downstream graziers who sued him and his brother in the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court]] in June 1898. McCaughey lost the case and the jury awarded 2000 pounds damages to the plaintiff and he was ordered to limit the height of his dams. The other plaintiffs were later compensated with 10,000 pounds and McCaughey paid 17,000 pounds in legal costs.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|104}} \n\nMcCaughey's inability to further his interests at Coonong encouraged him to purchase the North Yanco property in 1899 from Sir Charles Douglass for 220,000 pounds. At North Yanco, with its frontage on the Murrumbidgee, McCaughey felt that he could experiment with water conservation and irrigation measures without complaint from his neighbours. By this time he had also become convinced that large-scale irrigation schemes could materially benefit pastoralism in western NSW. To demonstrate this to the NSW public and government he determined to build such a scheme at North Yanco. This would demonstrate the possibilities of closer settlement based on intensive cultivation in dry areas while also increasing the station's sheep carrying capacity. The long-term goal of the plan was to subdivide North Yanko and establish irrigated farms for his employees and other settlers. To ensure the plan's success he decided to reside at North Yanco and oversee its development himself.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2/>{{rp|54}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9/>{{rp|87, 93}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-8>Review, 228</ref>\n\nIn the same year McCaughey was appointed to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|NSW Legislative Council]] by Sir [[George Reid]] to secure the passage of the [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] enabling bill. Reid valued McCaughey's experience and knowledge of land and McCaughey, who had no strong political leanings, was able to further some of his interests, such as large-scale immigration and, in time, irrigation schemes.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/>\n\nSir McCaughey initially worked on providing water for the gardens and grounds of his new mansion at the original homestead site. A system of irrigation channels was cut across the site and a pumping plant built on the [[Murrumbidgee River]] 400 yards to the south. A subterranean irrigation system was built around the homestead area by removing the topsoil to a depth of 18 inches, installing a layer of gravel, and laying the excavated soil over the top. Through this method the area was watered by soakage which allowed the establishment of a beautiful gardens and grounds. An artificial lake was also created on the east side of the grounds.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9>McCaughey, 2015</ref>{{rp|87}}\n \nSir McCaughey's new mansion was built between 1899-1902. When completed it featured two billiard rooms, lofty reception rooms, and ornate stained glass windows on the staircase and several doors. As part of his continued advocacy for irrigation he often used the mansion for the entertainment of visiting dignitaries, politicians, and other interested parties when they toured his irrigation works. He subsequently became renowned for his hospitality.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9/>{{rp|87}}\n\nFollowing the completion of the irrigation works for the mansion area, Sir McCaughey commenced work on the main scheme to provide irrigation to the majority of the North Yanco Holding (approximately 1899-1900?). During the disastrous 1902 drought he already had 60 miles of channels constructed which irrigated 750 acres of Lucerne and 250 acres of sorghum. By 1903 the system involved 320km (200 miles) of channels with weirs, regulators, and pumps (30 horsepower engine) that diverted water from three offtakes at Bundidgerry Creek (80km east of his homestead), Oak Creek (50km east), and Cowabbee Creek (60km northeast) allowing the irrigation of 16,200 hectares (40,000 acres). Excess water from the system was channelled back to the river by a continuation of Cudgell Creek, known as Cudgell Escape. The system spread almost to his northeast boundary, 100km west of the Bundidgerry creek intake. It mainly operated by gravitation but included at least one large rotary pump at the Pump Hole (at the end of Cudgell Escape). Traction engines and large scoops were used to excavate and maintain the irrigation system. Two of the engineers on the project were nephews of Sir McCaughey, Francis McCay and Alexander Stewart, that he had purposefully brought over from Ulster. Lucerne was the main grass grown as sheep fodder, but wheat, oaks, and potatoes were also cultivated. It proved to be a very successful and economical enterprise that allowed Sir McCaughey to prosper despite drought conditions. During the 1902 drought he also propped up the local/regional economy by offering work building channels to any man. Thus, by 1903 the station employed about 200 men. However, it is unclear how sustainable this farming method was across this landscape or land system as it may have quickly depleted the soil over the next five or ten years.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|80, 104}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9/>{{rp|87-89}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-8/>\n\nBeing a keen advocate of irrigation and a member of the NSW Legislative Council, Sir McCaughey, had greater plans for irrigation works in the region. In May 1903 he demonstrated to a Narrandera meeting that during the recent drought (1902) he had been able to grow sorghum 3-4m high and run 198 sheep a hectare using his irrigation scheme. This he argued, was a convincing reason to harness the Murrumbidgee River for irrigation. Consequently, in July 1903, Robert Gibson, the MLA of the [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]] district (and a colleague of Sir McCaughey), applied for leave to bring the Murrumbidgee Northern Supply and Irrigation bill before parliament that would finally implement part of the long-proposed [[Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area]] (MIA) scheme as a private enterprise.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|104-105}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9/>{{rp|89-90}}\n\n=====Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area=====\nAs an Interstate Royal Commission on the [[Murray River]] in 1902 had determined that large scale irrigation was an intercolonial question the NSW government felt that the issues this bill raised were a government matter. Consequently, the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Deaprtment]] considered various Murrumbidgee irrigation proposals throughout 1903-1904. Finally, in 1905, the government engineer L. A. B. Wade finalised an acceptable scheme that was basically a larger version of McCaughey's scheme. It involved building a dam across the Murrumbidgee at [[Burrinjuck Dam|Burrinjuck]], near [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], a weir at the Bundidgerry Creek intake, and a system of canals and water supply operating by gravitation between the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan Rivers. As the North Yanco scheme was already operational the MIA scheme could proceed by expanding its canal system on the plains west of Narrandera. Work began on this scheme (the MIA) by September 1905 when the Cudgel Creek cutting was commenced, which was opened on 25 April 1906. However, Wade's plan was not officially approved by the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] until 19 December 1906 when the Barren Jack Dam and Murrumbidgee Canals Construction Act was passed. Construction of [[Burrinjuck Dam]] began in February 1907 and Berembed Weir and the main canal at Narrandera in January 1908.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|105}}\n\nIn 1910 the NSW Government declared the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) with the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Act. The MIA was to have hundreds of new irrigation based farms and two new towns, [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] and [[Leeton, New South Wales|Leeton]], which were both designed by Walter Burley Griffin (and his wife?), the American (Chicago) architect who won the design competition for [[Canberra]]. The construction of Leeton began in 1911 and applications opened for the first 500 irrigation blocks in early 1912. Water was available to Yanco farms by July and by August 196 applicants were settled on their blocks. By March 1913 206kms of canals were completed which made 121,500 hectares available for irrigation. Industry continued to thrive in the MIA over the following years with a cannery and butter factory opening in Leeton and a bacon factory in Yanko. This early irrigation appears to have been sourced only from the regular flow of the Murrumbidgee as the Burrinjuck Dam was not completed enough to provide water to the MIA until 1917. It was finally completed in 1927.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|105}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9/>{{rp|89-90}}\n\nToday the MIA contains at least 3700 farms and 2500kms of canals. However, due to poor planning and the initial set-up of the scheme, it has never repaid the cost of its construction.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|106}}\n\nDuring Sir McCaughey's time the North Yanco headstation was supplied with a range of quality buildings. The men's huts are recorded to have had reading, dining, and bedrooms \"fit for a city club\". His blacksmith's workshop was of such quality that it produced machinery such as improved earth scoops for tank making, water wheels, ten furrow reversible ploughs, and combine harvesters. The headstation also featured wheelwright's and carpenter's shops, as well as an oil driven dynamo that produced electricity for the house and machine sheds. The orchard was based on 30cm of river sand packed at the bottom of trenches a meter deep.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|80}}\n\nThe majority of North Yanco, about 68,000 acres, was sold to the government for 3/10/- pounds an acre to construct the first stage of the MIA in June 1911. Sir McCaughey retained a life tenancy for 28,000 acres to the south of the Narrandera-Yanko railway allowing him to continue to reside at North Yanko. Sir McCaughey had already begun to dispose of his properties following the passing of the federal Land Tax Act in 1910. It is said that during Sir McCaughey's last years at North Yanco to celebrate his achievements he carved vinci - I conquered, over the door to his mansion. (McCaughey, 2015:89-90).<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|80, 105}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/>\n\nThe engineering workshops at North Yanko, besides producing vital equipment for the station and irrigation scheme, allowed Sir McCaughey to indulge his flair for inventing and experimenting with mechanical appliances. Although he had never taken an engineering course and employed several blacksmiths, he conducted much of the experimental work himself. Ultimately, he was responsible for the design and improvement of many farm implements. For instance, in NSW, he pioneered the use of heavy machinery for ploughing and soil excavation. He encouraged the use of mechanical devices on his other properties, which included the use of Wolseley machines for shearing at Dunlop in 1888. This was the first time shearing had been done completely mechanically in Australia.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9/>{{rp|89}}\n\nSir McCaughey passed away on 25 July 1919 after a long battel with nephritis. He was buried in the churchyard of St John's Presbyterian Church in Narrandera. During his lifetime he became a giant of Australian pastoralism and his thrift, acumen, and generosity became legendary. King Edward VII conferred a knighthood on him in June 1905 in recognition of his contribution to the Australian wool industry and his numerous philanthropic and patriotic gifts. In 1911 when he began to sell his properties he was the largest sheep owner in Australia and owned over 1.7 million hectares in NSW and [[Queensland]]. At the time of his death his estate was worth over 1,600,000 pounds. The majority of this estate were philanthropic gifts to charities, religious organisations, schools, hospitals, and universities.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|80}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/>\n\nThe year following Sir McCaughey's death the remainder of the North Yanco property reverted to the control of the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission (WCIC).<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n===Yanco Agricultural High School (since 1922)=== \nDuring the late nineteenth century the study of, and training in, agriculture along scientific principles began to gain increasing attention in western societies. This style of education blossomed in Britain and North America prior to the 1880s and was associated with an interest in \"scientific farming\" which would assist agriculturalists in expanding upon their traditional ways using empirical knowledge. Agricultural colleges first appeared in Australia in the 1880s and were linked to the older interest in agriculture that had been expressed in the formation of Agricultural and Pastoral Societies and Experimental Farms that examined issues about acclimatisation, etc. The first Agricultural College in Australia was at Roseworthy in [[South Australia]], which was established in 1883. NSW soon followed this lead with the establishment of Hawksbury Agricultural College in 1891 by the NSW Department of Mines and Agriculture. These institutions were residential and espoused systematic and scientific approaches to farming. Education was provided through theoretical and practical lessons, experimental programs, and publications. These colleges appear to have been the catalyst for the establishment of Agricultural High Schools in NSW early in the twentieth century.<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-17>Atkin and Looker, 2002:12</ref><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-18/>{{rp|30}}\n\nIt appears that agricultural education was a low priority in the NSW education system for a time after the establishment of Hawksbury Agricultural College. This was due to the ready availability of a practical education in the pastoral community. This situation was rectified in the early twentieth century following a review of the education system in 1902-1903 which resulted in major reforms. These reforms were designed to keep NSW apace of advances in secondary education in the western world. A major part of the reforms was to improve the curriculum and increase the number of high schools while also providing continuation schools for students not qualified to enter high schools. The idea behind this reform was that post-primary education should be pre-vocational in nature. Agricultural high schools were a combination of these ideas providing academic schooling and grounding in the elementary theory and practice of agriculture.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-18>Brooks & Associates, 2009</ref>{{rp|30-32}}\n\nThe first Agricultural High School established in NSW was Hurlstone in 1907, which was located at [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]]. By 1915 this school had outgrown this site, but it was not until 1926 that it was relocated to a new site at [[Glenfield, New South Wales|Glenfield]]. In 1907 a Technical College was also opened at [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], which was a continuation school specialising in sheep, wool, and agriculture. In 1916 the Education department attempted to expand agricultural schooling by offering courses at five high schools: [[Albury]], [[Wagga Wagga]], [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Casino, New South Wales|Casino]], and Yass. These courses were not successful and necessitated the revision of agricultural education in NSW. The result of this revision was that Hurlstone would be moved to a new remote area (however, this did not occur until 1926) and a new agricultural high school would be established at Yanco.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-18/>{{rp|32-33}}<ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nThe [[Minister for Education (New South Wales)|NSW Minister for Education]], Tom D. Mutch, visited the Leeton area in 1920, possibly as part of a tour of the MIA. During this visit he met a deputation of local residents who petitioned him to establish a new Agricultural High School in the MIA to help educate boys in irrigation and agricultural techniques to prepare them for farming life here. The deputation (perhaps) suggested that the McCaughey Mansion, which had recently been left vacant by the death of Sir McCaughey, could be used for this purpose. Minister Mutch decided to champion this idea. The McCaughey Mansion was owned by the WCIC, but they were willing to provide this 636 acre property (two blocks 443 and 193 acres each) to the Department of Education for the new school for free in March 1921.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\">[[Department of Education (New South Wales)|NSW Department of Education]] documents</ref> \n\nYAHS was opened on 20 February 1922 with 60 residential students in the first intake (maximum capacity). This was 5 or 10 more students that the school had originally advertised for. Mr Ernest Breakwell (1922-1928) was the first headmaster and Mrs Breakwell the matron. Staff included two assistant teachers, an instructor in farm mechanics, a gardener, and a general hand. The school aims were to provide a three-year course in agriculture for boys culminating in the intermediate certificate. Students could then proceed to Hawksbury Agricultural College or go straight onto the land. It was to offer a sound general education in addition to specialised courses in agricultural sciences, as well as practical training in the field and workshop. The agriculture course was to have an emphasis on irrigation farming techniques due to the school's location in the MIA. An accompanying underlying aim of the school was to slow down, or even reverse, the drift of population from country areas into the cities. However, it could never hope to achieve this aim. To enter the school students needed to pass the competitive Qualifying Certificate offered at the end of Primary School.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nAt the time of the opening the school facilities were described as:<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n{{blockquote|'The main building is a two storied house built with brick walls and covered with a slate roof. This building has been converted into dormitories and dining rooms for the students, whilst a portion has been set apart for the Principal of the School. In this building ample kitchen and pantry accommodation is provided as well as quarters for the domestic helps, and very extensive verandahs and balconies. }}\n\nThe original bungalow in which the former owner once resided is a structure partly built of brick and partly of timber, and has extensive wide verandah all round. This building is also being utilised for students' dormitories and a common room, also for accommodating the teaching staff.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n \nThe two foregoing buildings will provide housing accommodation for the Principal and his family, the teaching staff and about sixty students.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nA brick building originally used for men's quarters has been converted into classrooms and science rooms, and another brick outbuilding has been fitted up with shower, baths, and lockers, so that the students after working in the field may bath and change their clothing before entering the main building.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nProvision has been made to install electric light in the principal buildings and also for outside lamps to light up the approaches in the vicinity of the main buildings' (DoE Documents).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThis is the story according to the official documents, but oral history from three of the original students recorded on a plaque at the school tells a different tale. According to this history the first students arrived on Friday 20 January 1922 and found the Mansion and ancillary buildings, including huge stables, stockyards, blacksmiths shops, mens' quarters, sawmill, two 800 ton haysheds, and large pumping station on the river, deserted and uncared for since 1919. As such, there were no beds, class rooms, or recreation facilities, and limited kitchen and messing facilities. Hurricane lamps provided light and meals were cooked over an open fire in the yard during the first months. Furthermore, there nearest neighbour was three miles away at the Yanco Experiment Farm. Despite the school not becoming co-education until 1993 (or 1995), Phillis Breakwell, the daughter of the Principal and Matron, was the first female student at the school as she was a member of the original class and finished the original three year course in 1924. This oral history also details that the life sized portrait of Sir McCaughey by McCubbin was donated to the school in 1923 by Mr Roy McCaughey of Coonong Station, near Narrandera.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=history/>\n\nOver the following years the school proved successful and improved and expanded facilities were required for increased demand. By 1927 the school land had been subdivided into 14 paddocks, dairy, pig, and sheep herds/flocks established and the school made self-sufficient in vegetables, milk, butter, and stock feed. The grounds and flower beds were well kept and remained beautiful and a source of admiration to all visitors. This resulted in the construction of the Mutch dormitory, principal's residence, and school hall in 1928, as well as the lease of an additional 151 acres. Sporting fields were also reportedly developed between the school and Euroley road to the west.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nOliver Gardiner was the second principal between late 1928 and late 1933. A School Council was formed in 1933 of parents, Old Yanconians, and community members. To this day this council has assisted in the running of the school (organising events, etc) and raising funds for works, equipment, etc, for the school.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nPercival Hindmarsh was the third principal of YAHS between 1934 and 1937. In 1934 the first fourth year class was established at the school during the transition from a three year course at the school to a five year which culminated in the normal high school Leaving Certificate Examination (in 1935). This five year course differed only from the ordinary high school course by the substitution of agriculture for Latin. Thus, the English, History, Mathematics, French, and Elementary Science courses were the same as those taught in normal high schools. The agricultural courses covered the principles and practice of agriculture, entomology, agricultural botany, soil physics, and wool-classing (which was very popular). To enable agriculture to be comprehensively taught an intensively cultivated model farm was developed on site that included a dairy and dairy herd, piggery and pig (herd), sheep flock, 30 acres of irrigated pastures (five paddocks of 6 acres), 28 acres of crops (lucerne and ceral crops), 5-6 acres of vegetables, orchard, and poultry yard and flock. The operations of the school farm were carried out by the students under the supervision of their teachers, with students doing an average of seven hours of practical work a week. The school's goal was to be self-sufficient and it was already self-sufficient in milk and vegetable, and partially in meat and butter. During this time a sporting house system was introduced at the school and an annual Beach Carnival inaugurated by Jack Woods, a teacher and former [[Sydney]] surf life-saver (Bill Barwick History).<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nIn 1934 the construction of residences for the school dairyman and gardener were approved when funds were available. It is not known if and where these residences were established. At this time the school also required a drying cabinet to dry laundry in wet conditions which would be installed in the current laundry building, as well as a portable classroom for the new 4th year class. Planning was also underway to construct a new stable buildings, implement and hay sheds, as well as a tub silo. It is unclear if these buildings were constructed. A new classroom block was also being planned, which would be built on the site of the existing stables. In 1935 the old blacksmith's shop (McCaughey's forge room) was demolished and a new building erected for woodworking and metal work (black smithing). When constructed it was a wooden building with iron roofing (the \"Hackey\" building). This building was constructed to bring the schools blacksmithing and manual training utilities up to standard. During the 1930s the school enrolment was between 180-200 students making the school one of the largest residential schools in the state. The school had its own water supply and a sewerage treatment plant (using a septic tank).<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nJames McEwan King was the fourth principal of YAHS between 1938 and 1945. His tenure saw the further consolidation and development of the school and its ill-fated name change which was part of a wider policy by the Department of Education. In October 1939 the school name was changed to McCaughey Memorial High School by the Minister for Education, D. H. Drummond. This unpopular change lasted two years until the name was changed back to Yanco Agricultural High School in October 1942 after a change of Government. A new two-storey classroom block was also constructed at the school in 1939 to provide state of the art agricultural science laboratories, as well as some office space for the staff. This building replaced the classrooms in McCaughey's former shearing quarters. When constructed it was described as a two-storey brick structure with tile roof and the following facilities:<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n'On the ground floor: 4 standard classrooms each 25 ft. 6 in. by 22 ft. 6 in., a Science Laboratory 45 ft. x 22 ft. 6 in. with Preparation Room off same 22 ft. 6 in. x 8 ft. Staff Room, a Store Room, Switch Room, Plant Room, etc. Two staircases (of fireproof construction) provide access to the First Floor which duplicates the accommodation on the Ground Floor, the Laboratory being for Biological purposes in this case.'<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n'The new School Building is equipped with \"A petrol spirit hollow-wire Distribution System\", for the provision of burners to benches in the Science and Biological Laboratory respectively'.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nThe staff compliment in the late 1930s was the headmaster, three graduates in agricultural science, five graduates in other subjects, and instructors in Farm Mechanics, Farm Practices, and Horticulture. A new sanitary block was also constructed around this time and by the late 1930s a silo, shearing plant, and stables as well. At this time the school was described as comprising \"a main building with the T. D. Mutch building attached, utilised for dormitories for about 200 pupils, the commissariat department, and a library, a classroom block containing 6 classrooms and a laboratory, and a number of minor buildings comprising one for the maids\" quarters, one for the field staff, an assembly hall, a blacksmith and manual training block, dairy and piggery, and a separate residence for the Principal'. By the end of the 1930s the school grounds were 779 acres of which 161 acres were leased. Academically, the school boasted that its students were probably better equipped for farming than those of Hawksbury Agricultural College considering its all-round curriculum. However, the majority of students (around 70%) who graduated from YAHS returned to their family farms rather than matriculate to Hawksbury Agricultural College.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nThe success of YAHS up to this period appears to have encouraged the establishment of another agricultural high school in the north of the state at [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] in 1939. This was named Farrier Memorial Agricultural High School. From this period onwards Yanco catered for the agricultural families of the south and west of the state, Farrier the north, and Hurlstone the greater metropolitan region. Besides these high schools many other rural schools offered agricultural courses during this period.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> WWII stretched the resources of the school as the armed forces recruited former students, teaching, and farm staff. However, the school fought to weather wartime deprivations and also had an active student cadet unit throughout the war.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nThomas Mason was the fifth principal of YAHS between 1946 and 1947 who commenced an annual gala day and fireworks display in March 1947. The goal of this annual event was to raise funds for a school war memorial. Mason was followed by Richard Jane who remained principal for ten years (1948 and 1958). School problems and issues in 1955 included a proposed swimming pool (and funding issues) and the establishment of a filtration plant for the school's drinking water supply. Planning was also underway to construct a new dormitory block, a separate sick bay, the extension of the library on the ground floor of the McCaughey House, convert the existing sick bay to a reception room (in McCaughey House?), extend the dining room in the Mason building to accommodate 300 students, and the construction of a store. Some of these planned improvements definitely occurred over the following decade, while it is unclear if others were carried out. Enrolments between 1955-1957 were 202-216 boys.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nIn the mid-1950s agricultural science continued to be a part of the broader curriculum of the NSW Education system. It was part of the natural science section of the primary school curriculum. At high school level agricultural courses were available in agriculture, agricultural biology, and farm mechanics at more than 80 country schools. However, only three Agricultural High Schools were operating that supplied a specialist education in this area, Hurlstone (1907), Yanco (1922), and Farrier Memorial (1939), that also supplied their students with a first-rate general education. The focus on this area in the NSW education system was related to the contemporary perception that the future of the state would depend largely on the extension and development of its agricultural resources. Therefore, specialist schools such as these were necessary to provide a proper education for potential farmers.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nFollowing the end of World War II the YAHS community chose to memorialise this devastating event through the construction of some sort of feature on the school grounds. However, it took some time for the idea of a swimming pool to be settled on and for the necessary funds to be gathered. It might not have been until 1956 until this occurred and the initial excavation undertaken for the pool. Unfortunately, construction did not begin straight away and in the interim the excavation was used as a school cadet shooting range (this was a common school community/activity group post-war). Construction finally began in 1958 with the pool being completed in 1961. Mr Richard Giltinan (1959-1973) was the headmaster at this time and the school enrolment 223 and staff compliment of 15. This included four teachers of English, History, and Geography, four teachers of Science, two teachers of Mathematics, one French teacher, two Farm Mechanics teachers, one Physical education teacher and Sportsmaster, and one visiting Sheep and Wool Instructor. As such the school curriculum consisted of English, History, Geography, French, Mathematics, Elementary Science, Agricultural Science, and specialised agricultural subjects including Farm Mechanics and Woolclassing.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nThe continued success of the school to the 1960s required further extensions of its facilities including two additional dormitory wings (29 April 1965), the John Walsh Hospital block (1963), a teachers' common room (1963), a garage (1963), an extension to the dining room (1963 - Mason Dormitory?), and four demountable classrooms.<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-19>May 1969</ref> \n\nThe early 1960s extensions cost a total of approximately 250,000 pounds and the two new dormitory wings were named after the first two principals of the school, Breakwell and Gardiner. They eased severe overcrowding in the former school dormitories. By the late 1960s the school enrolment had grown to 325 boys with a staff of 21 teachers. Other social aspects of the school had crystallised by this time including the school motto ''Ut Sementem Feceris Ita Metes'' which is a quotation from St Paul's New Testament Epistle to the Galatians meaning \"As You Sow, So Shall You Reap\". The school colours were royal blue and gold and it had four houses for sporting activities and academic competition. These houses were named after early personalities associated with the establishment of the school, McCaughy, Mutch, Breakwell, and Gardiner.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nBy the mid-1960s the Old Boy's Union, the Yanconians, was meeting regularly and assisting the School Council in working bees, as well as providing funds for school features such as memorials. For instance, they provided a granite memorial commemorating all the Yanconians who served in the armed forces during WWII. The School Council working bees also assisted in the development of new sporting fields to the north of the Principals Residence.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nIn 1971 the school was finally provided with a library building which it had been in want of at least since the early 1960s. This library was a type built at many schools at the time and was a combined library and science laboratory building funded by a [[Australian Government]] initiative. In 1976 the school was also supplied with another dormitory, Hindmarsh House, which was built to provide single room study facilities for students studying for Year 12. To ease fast staff turnover rates the school was also supplied with additional staff facilities and accommodation that could provide for married and single staff. By 1977 the school was also beginning to contemplate the possibility of the school becoming co-educational due to society's changing attitudes to single-sex education.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nMr A. I. Bond was Principal in 1982 when the school had a staff of 27 and 281 enrolments. By this time the school had several problems including student and staff accommodation, the dilapidated condition of the classroom block (1939), staffing formula, and rising cost of fees. Most importantly the school continued to considering whether it would become a co-educational school. Unlike Hurlstone, which was forced to rapidly transfer to co-education in 1979, YAHS was allowed time to consider and plan for this change. While only being a partial step in this direction, the school completed a new dining room and kitchen facility in 1988. This dining room could accommodate 400 students and was an important new facility for the school.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nThe government announced the coming of co-education to YAHS in September 1991. This change was to be accompanied by a substantial building program to provide the necessary facilities for girl students. This included the Mason dormitory (90 students), the music and arts classroom blocks, and technological and applied studies block. Mutch House was also substantially renovated during this development so that it provided accommodation for sixty students and the medical centre extended. In January 1993 the first female students were enrolled in the school (75) across Years 7 to 11. Full co-education was achieved in 1996. These developments were undertaken with the maintenance of the schools character in mind and the preservation of the rural openness of its setting being a priority. As such, this development appears to have taken place with heritage issues in mind while also seeing to the needs of modern educational needs.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nA new piggery and breeding complex were built in the early 1990s using funds from the sale of the school's dairy cattle and its milk quota. The swimming pool and school hall were also the focus of major refurbishment projects in the late 1990s. More recently, the school's tennis courts were upgraded to be a playing surface for tennis and netball all year round and supplied with lighting. In 2007 the school received a major new facility with the construction of an Equine and Show Stock Centre.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nToday the school's highly successful show stock team prepares and exhibits cattle at regional, state, and interstate shows. The school's highly successful equestrian students participate in gymkhanas across the state and take on the role of a ceremonial honour guard for vice-regal and other important occasions. The schools charter has a focus on \"a strong sense of Scholarship, responsible Leadership, Personal Integrity, Citizenship and competitive Sportsmanship\" and it continues to provide a comprehensive co-educational residential experience in a rural setting for students from isolated areas in the state. The school has a long and extensive academic, agricultural, and sporting traditions and has achieved a measure of distinction in public examinations and competitions. Its sporting success includes local and state competitions including the Buchan Shield in Rugby Union and the University Shield, six times, in Rugby League. With this history and continuing endeavour and succuss YAHS is held in high esteem by the local and rural communities of NSW.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n== Description == \n=== General context === \nYAHS comprises a large complex of approximately 50 educational and residential buildings on a 280 hectare property southwest of Yanco in Central NSW on the north bank of the Murrumbidgee River. The school is a co-educational, fully residential, high school specializing in agriculture. The school land includes 180ha for intensive irrigation and dry land agriculture and 60ha of natural (regrowth) bushland.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThe school property is bounded on its north and west sides by Euroley Road and its road reserve (which differ in some places), the Murrumbidgee River on its south side, and part of the Murrumbidgee Valley National Park on its east side. Another part of the national park lies to the west of Euroley Road on the west side of the school. As such, the school property lies between a corridor of the national park along the north side of the Murrumbidgee River. To the north of the school over Euroley Road are farm lands of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThe school has been described to have \"rural charm\" and be located in \"picturesque surroundings on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River\".<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nOver its history the school has been effectively a self-contained local community with its own distinct social structure and organisation. It has had its own recreation, health, education, sporting, and cultural spaces, as well as its own utilities, including electricity, water, and sewerage. As such, it is a very distinct and unusual type of educational facility in the NSW education system (Old Yanconians' Union Submission).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n=== School grounds and layout === \nThe extensive YAHS property comprises a number of different landscapes. The main building complex is situated around the original North Yanco Homestead in the southern centre of the school property. This complex comprises four main blocks with extra buildings along the fringes. The dormitories, general classrooms, and main admin centres are in the eastern two blocks while the specialist agricultural buildings are in the western two blocks. The teacher's residences are generally on the southeast fringe of the complex and the sports facilities on the northeast fringe.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nTo the southwest of the main building complex is a sewerage treatment facility and via a road to the south a smaller complex of five-six buildings which may be the water treatment plan. Along the banks of the Murrumbidgee are also two interwar period (1930s) teacher's residences.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThe main complex is connected to Euroley Road through a main entrance road (east) and a service road (west). The main entrance road leads from the northeast corner of the property to the front of the McCaughy Mansion and connects to the road to the south of the dormitories. This road features white gates and a traffic island with restored ploughs or other farming machinery. These decorative gates were constructed by staff and students during the mid-1930s in the original school workshop (a McCaughey period building) (Old Yanconian Union Submission). This road may be the original carriageway from the McCaughey period. It also features mature tree plantings along its length. The service road commences a few hundred metres to the west of the main entrance road adjacent a functioning canal. It follows this canal through much of the school property and runs through the centre of the main complex before heading towards the banks of the Murrumbidgee near the two interwar teacher's residences.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nTo the east and west of the main school complex are two creeks: Guises Creek to the west and an unnamed creek to the east. Both these creek lines appear to be intermittent. The creek to the east appears to have been converted into a canal during the North Yanco Irrigation Scheme (1899-1903). The agricultural fields of the school appear to lie between these two creeks. The landscape to the east of the main access road and the unnamed creek is forested (regrowth) and merges into the Murrumbidgee Valley National Park to the east. This forest is known as the boys' forest. The landscape to the west of Guises Creek rises gently and appears to be used for pasture or equestrian riding/training, but it is mostly cleared except for regrowth forest along the creek line. This forest is known as the girls' forest. There appears to be a former paddock to the west of the south portion of the creek. The agricultural fields lie mainly to the north of the school complex to either side of a still functioning canal from the North Yanco Irrigation Scheme. A small triangular orchard is located to the north of the agricultural blocks of the school complex. Agricultural fields or grazing land lies to the south of the school complex between it and the river.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nDirectly to the north of the school gymnasium to the west of the main entrance road are several sporting ovals which were built in the early 1960s. This area was previously an orchard and farming area (Old Yanconian Union Submission).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n====Buildings and capacity====\nIt had an enrolment of over 370 students in 2012 and has reached its accommodation capacity. It has a class block (known as \"the Old Class block\") because of its age. The classblock has eight classrooms, a science lab, a computer lab, the English staffroom, and the Maths staffroom. There is a Technical and Applied Studies block which contains a TAS staffroom, three classrooms, a cooking room, a computer lab, and at the end (a demountable) an ex-science lab, now used as a classroom. There are woodwork and metalwork rooms in a building known as \"the Hackey\". There is another class block (known as \"the New Classblock\" or the \"Brian Roberts Classblock\"), which contains an Art/Music staffroom, HSIE staffroom, three classrooms, a music room, art rooms, and soon to be computer lab. There are offices in the historic McCaughey house.\n\nThere are 12 dormitory buildings (Mutch, Gardiner, Breakwell, Hindmarsh, Mason, Gosper, Eadis, Hyatt, Hilton and the pods ) where students sleep; girls and boys are separated from access after certain times.\n\n=== Cultural landscapes === \nThe YAHS property has two distinctive cultural landscape layers which are of state significance. They are associated with the following historical periods of use of the site:<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n# North Yanco Irrigation Scheme (1899-1903): an extensive irrigation system built on the large North Yanco Holding (1830s-1919) to demonstrate the benefits and feasibility of irrigation to the NSW public and government;<ref name=nswshr-2021/> and\n# YAHS (1922-current): an agricultural high school, closely associated with irrigation, and established to support the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n====North Yanco Holding period buildings and landscape features====\nThe current school complex contains several buildings and landscape features dating to the North Yanco Holding period of occupation of the site. All these buildings and landscape features were adapted to serve educational functions when YAHS opened in 1922.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThe centrepiece of the school complex is the North Yanko Mansion (1899-1902), built by Sir Samuel McCaughey (B00A). It is a large two-storey Federation Arts and Crafts / Free Style mansion designed by the Sydney architect Herbert Ernest Ross (1868-1937). It is built of red brick with imitation [[sandstone]] trimming made of render/plaster or concrete. Each floor features a surrounding two-storey [[Veranda|verandah]] which is arched on the ground floor and columned on the first floor. It has projecting central [[gable|gables]] on three [[Facade|facades]] and a [[Hipped roof|hipped]] slate roof with a small central [[turret]]. When constructed the building was tastefully and expensively fitted out with a high standard of craftmanship which led it to be described \"as one of the most palatial and most modern homesteads\".<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-20>ATCJ, 1906</ref> \n\nAlthough the building is now used for school administration it retains many original Federation period features such as Wunderluch [[Pressed metal ceiling|pressed metal ceilings]] (different types in each room), tiled floors, [[marble]] fireplaces, grand timber staircase, metal and timber fittings, plaster decorations, and stained glass windows. The main stained glass window above the grand timber staircase was designed by Herbert Ross and manufactured by F. Ashwin & Co. of 314 Pitt Street, Sydney. Much of the school's history is displayed or stored in the building including the portraits of the former principals.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nA number of pieces of movable heritage are also stored at YAHS including:<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* A life size oil portrait of Sir Samuel McCaughey in full court dress painted by Frederick McCubbin in 1901. A plaque in the school with oral history from three of the original students at the school details that this portrait was donated to the school in 1923 by Mr Roy McCaughey of Coonong Station, near Narrandera. This portrait with its frame and case was restored in 2004 with funds supplied by a generous Old Yanconian.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> A dress sword owned by Sir Samuel McCaughey.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* A large collection of school memorabilia including honour rolls, framed prints, school magazines, photographs, trophies, ribbons, etc.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* A number of pieces of historic engineering equipment from the McCaughey period, as well as items used at the agricultural school.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* Sir Samuel McCaughey's Pump, a restored memorial feature - originally part of the main supply source for the North Yanco irrigation system on Cudgel Creek.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nWhen the McCaughey Mansion was originally constructed it was surrounded to the east by landscaped gardens and an artificial lake (1899-1902). It is possible that these garden was designed by McCaughey and symmetrical in layout (Old Yanconians Union Submission). This garden space is extant, but it does not appear that many of the individual trees and plantings date to the original planting scheme. However, this area is still significant as a green space and it also contains some school memorials. The artificial lake retains two islands, a disused aviary, and a foot bridge which appear to be consistent with its original design although the foot bridge for instance has been replaced. The current Parents and Citizens Association of the school notes that the school gardens have been landscaped to conform to the original garden beds and that they are upgraded to conform with what is known of the original flowers and plantings of the McCaughey period gardens (submission).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nAt least two early branch canals of the North Yanco Irrigation Scheme are extant which were once integrated into the school agricultural works. One of these is visible and still functioning to the east of the service road. It once extended along the west side of the school complex running parallel to this road, all the way to the Murrumbidgee River. To the north of the school complex this canal is mostly extant, particular with distance from the school buildings, and along one section is lined with mature tree plantings. It has been destroyed by new buildings throughout the school complex. To the south of the school complex it is present archaeologically in the agricultural field between the complex and the interwar teacher's residences along the Murrumbidgee River. The other remnant canal appears to be a modified creek. It is located in the western verge of the bushland to the east of the school complex (within the school grounds). To the north of the school property it runs parallel to the eastern access road to the school complex.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nIt is possible that the current school laundry building (B00L) dates to the North Yanco Holding period (between 1902 and 1917) based on photographic evidence (a Kerry & Co photograph). It is a L-shaped render covered brick building with a hipped (gambrel form) [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]] roof with the northern wing being a later extension. When YAHS opened the building was converted into a shower room for the students. Over its life it has served many functions including the boys shower room, boiler room, vegetable store room, canteen, and laundry. The boiler was originally fired by coal, but has been converted to new fuels over time including wood, oil, LPG, and natural gas. When the conversion to natural gas occurred, the entire building was converted into an extended laundry (maybe the north wing was added at this time) and the western section retained for use as a Maintenance workshop. This workshop remained in the building until 2000 when a new workshop was constructed in the school complex. Today the building is fitted out as a commercial type laundry facility in order to serve the school's large (300 pupils plus staff) laundry needs. As such, the building interior contains little original fabric.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n==== YAHS buildings ==== \nThe following YAHS buildings are within the SHR curtilage for this item. They constitute the remaining buildings from the historic periods of construction at the school, as well as the later larger dormitory buildings within the main block of the school complex.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nFrom the original conversion of the North Yanco Holding buildings into an educational complex in 1921-22 the Department of Education has continued to add new buildings to meet the expanded needs of the school. This includes upgrading existing buildings to meet changing educational needs. From 1927 all the buildings were built by the Department of Education or Public Works and were often constructed during short phases of improvement and expansion works (see history).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nAfter a few years of successful operation, the school facilities were expanded with a number of new buildings in 1927. These all survive on site (although they have continued to be modified to suit new educational needs):<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The School Hall<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-21>B00H - 1927</ref> is a rectangular brick building with front [[portico]] and rear back-stage extension. It has a peculiar form of tiled gable roof. Instead of the roof lines meeting at an apex the top of the roof slopes down on a 45 degree angle. The front and rear sides of the building are decorated with painted rendered feature panels (or [[columns]]). The north side of the building also features three [[Emergency exit|emergency exits]] which are likely modern alterations. The hall is the centre of many social or formal activities for the school including examinations, assembles, community events, performances, and meetings. It also houses a large range of the schools Honour Rolls which are considered to be a rich part of its history. It was the subject of a major refurbishment project in the late 1990s.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The Principals Residence (1927) is a rectangular roughcast rendered brick building with a tiled hipped roof, and wide, flat roofed verandah around its north, east, and south sides. The verandah is supported by rendered columns and has been \"filled-in\" at its northern end with [[weatherboard]] walls to build additional rooms. It looks to have been designed to be basically symmetrical along the front facade, although the three [[chimneys]] are asymmetrically placed. It appears that over time when renovations have occurred to the McCaughey Mansion, fireplaces that have been removed from this building have been placed in this residence. Consequently, each of its three fireplaces has a fine marble federation style fireplace. Many original features of this building are intact, however, it requires appropriate refurbishment and maintenance works.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The Mutch Dormitory<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-22>B00D - 1927</ref> was the first purpose-built student accommodation building constructed at the school. It is attributed to the NSW Government Architect Seymour Wells by the National Trust (NSW). It is a L-shaped two storey building with a hipped CGI roof. It is primarily built of brick, but across its north exterior and south and east interior facades it has long sections of brick columns supporting first storey cream weatherboard wall sections. These features form deep verandahs for the ground floor of the building and corridors above. This building contained the school kitchen and dining room on its ground floor from its construction (1927) until the James McEwan King Dining Room was completed in 1988. In the early 1990s (prior to 1993) this dormitory was substantially renovated to provide accommodation for sixty students as part of the preparation for co-education. Perhaps when the Gardiner Dormitory was built in the early 1960s the south wing of the Mason dormitory was extended by two [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] in the same style. Today its ground floor contains teachers' offices and its first floor is a girls' dormitory. The dormitory rooms are very simple with [[linoleum]] floors and no fixed room dividers and set-up with six beds, chests, and movable room dividers. Students are free to decorate their dormitories as they see fit.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> Of this set of building the School Hall and Mutch Dormitory display a similar design palate of bare brick highlighted with cream features weather this be plaster columns or weatherboard. The Principal's Residence has a different design palate, although it does feature cream rendered brick walls (it lacks the bare brick walls of the other buildings).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> In the mid-1930s another round of school expansion occurred which appeared to be associated with providing new and upgraded teaching facilities to replace those that had had previously been fitted into McCaughey period buildings (Shearers' quarters and blacksmiths workshop). This included:<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The \"Hackey\" (B00N) - Industrial Arts Block (wood and metal working) - built in 1935. It is a L-shaped timber (perhaps a form of weatherboard) building with CGI gable roof. It was designed and built as a temporary educational building. It was initially nicknamed \"The Morgue\" by students after H. J. Morgan, the manual arts teacher between 1944 and 1945. It was later renamed \"The Hackey\" after H. Kaplin, the industrial arts teacher between 1955 and 1958. Today, this building continues to be used to teach wood and metal technical subjects and the metal area was upgraded in 2012 with funds provided by the Australian Government Trade Training Centre initiative. This is an open plan building with movable teaching benches and a range of woodworking and metalworking equipment. The building also features a large ventilation system which seems to have its exterior vent as a hood on the peak of the north wing.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* In 1939 the Old School Block (B00F) was built to provide new classrooms and laboratory facilities. It is attributed to Cobden Parks, NSW Government Architect by the National Trust (NSW). It is a two storey L-shaped brick building that originally contained eight classrooms, a downstairs office for teaching staff, an upstairs office for the deputy principal and subject heads, and two science/agricultural laboratories. It appears to continue in use for general learning today with there being no specialist laboratories in the building. The building interior is painted a pale blue and is in a fair condition with perhaps some original features. Air conditioning has been added to the building and this has resulted in a large system of vents on the south exterior (and perhaps the west exterior). The [[foundation stone]] for this building was laid on 19 December 1938 by the Minister for Education, the Hon. D. H. Drummond.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* Two weatherboard teacher's residences were built along the Murrumbidgee River banks during the interwar period, probably the 1930s. They have hipped CGI roofs, verandahs, and a cream exterior paint scheme. They were originally built to provide accommodation for clerical and administrative staff as the unsealed roads to the school were often impassable due to wet weather at this time (Old Yanconians Union Submission). It appears that the east canal across the school grounds originally passed between these two residences before connecting with the Murrumbidgee River. Today they continue to be used as staff accommodation.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nAnother period of school expansion occurred during the 1960s. Within the SHR curtilage this phase is represented by:<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The War Memorial swimming pool, built between 1958 and 1961, and its amenities block, built in 2012, which was funded by YAHS P&C.; This pool was built to contemporary Olympic swimming standards. It was opened by the Member for Murrumbidgee, the Hon. A. G. Enticknap. The pool filtration plant was decorated with a mural in 1968 by the local artist Mrs A. Campbell, whose sons attended the school. The mural features an agricultural theme and depicts the goddess, Ceres, with sheaves of grain along with other mythological features. Major repairs were undertaken on the pool in the mid 1990s, costing over $100,000, to prevent leakage and extend the pool's life.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The Breakwell and Gardiner Dormitories<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-23>B00G/B00E - 1961-1963</ref> are two-storey brick L-shaped buildings of the same design. They were built to expand the accommodation facilities of the school. These two L-shaped double storey buildings originally contained three dormitories (housing 144 students), shower and toilet facilities, and two teacher rooms on each floor. These buildings may have been finished in 1963, but they were not officially opened until 29 April 1965 by the Hon. A. G. Enticknap, M.L.A. and Minister for Agriculture and Conservation. Similar to the Mutch dormitory, today these dormitory rooms are simple, being large rooms with movable bed furniture. Each floor may also contain a kitchenette or TV room.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The Dr John O'Walsh Memorial Hospital Block<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-24>B00C - 1963/4</ref> is a single storey brick rectangular building. It features an older section and a more modern extension dating to when co-education was introduced (1993). It remains in use as a sick bay or medical centre today. This building was constructed during 1963 and occupied early in 1964. When opened it featured a matron's quarters, two wards, a casualty room, kitchen and toilet facilities.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThe SHR curtilage also features two buildings constructed during the 1970s which may or may not be of heritage significance.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> The Library and Science Block<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-25>B00B - 1971</ref> is a square brick building with a tiled roof. It was opened by the NSW Minister for Education, C. B. Cutler, on 6 August 1971. Its construction was part of a federal government initiative to provide library facilities and science laboratories to high schools across Australia. It is of a fairly common Department of Education design from this time period, and perhaps this program, known as a \"liblab\" building. It still serves these same functions today.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nIn 1975/76 the Hindmarsh Dormitory (B00J) was built in the southwest corner of the main block of the school complex. It is a three-storey \"L-shaped\" brick building. However, its design is somewhat multi-level with different sections being built on slight offsets (so they look diagonal from above) and with sloped roofs at different heights. It was built to provide single room accommodation for final year students preparing for their HSC. This building was named after Percival Hindmarsh the third principal of YAHS (1934-1937). This building may have been a singular original design from the NSW Government's Architect's office and school oral history notes that it received an award for its design. The NSW government architect at the time was G. P. Webber, but the name on some of the plans held at the school are P. P. Kerl?<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nFinally, the SHR curtilage contains three building built from the 1990s onwards. These buildings are unlikely to be of heritage significance.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThe music and arts block (or general learning building (B00I) was built 1992/1993 in the northwest corner of the main teaching/dormitory block as part of the preparation for co-education. This appears to be a L-shaped two storey brick building with a corrugated iron hipped roof. It features a raised first storey verandah on the interior side of the L. This building was designed by the Department of Public Works.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nOn the north side of the school complex is also a school gymnasium (B00U) and changerooms (B00Y). These are brick, flat roofed buildings. The gymnasium is two-storey. It is unknown exactly when these buildings were constructed.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n=== Condition === \n\nAs at 12 October 2018, Buildings on site are generally in a fair to good condition.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> West canal (still active) is in a good condition. Its southern archaeological sections are visible on satilite imagery. East canal (archaeological) is in a good condition. It is visible on the ground as a straight drainage feature with embankments on either side. It features unusual tree regrowth in a straight alignment on either side.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Yanco Agricultural High School War Cry<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yancoag-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/our-school/war-cry |title=About our school: War Cry |work=Yanco Agricultural High School |publisher=[[Department of Education (New South Wales)|NSW Department of Education]] |date=n.d. |access-date=19 February 2018 }}</ref> was chanted by the Mayor of the town of Paris during the town ball in the 1974 [[Peter Weir]] movie, ''[[The Cars That Ate Paris]]''.\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 28 July 2017, Yanco Agricultural High School (YAHS) is of state significance for its historic, associative, technical, social, research, rarity, and representative values. This site, which was originally the homestead complex of the North Yanco Holding, retains several rare features from this period including the McCaughey Mansion, its remnant landscaped gardens (including the artificial lake), carriage way, pump display, two remnant irrigation canals, and agricultural landscape. These features display how the North Yanco Holding played an important role in the history of large-scale irrigation schemes in NSW as the starting point of the North Yanco irrigation scheme developed by Sir Samuel McCaughey between 1899 and 1903. The success of this scheme led the NSW government to undertake the long-proposed Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) scheme in 1906. Through these features the site is strongly associated with Sir Samuel McCaughey (1835-1919), a successful, prominent, and influential pastoralist and sheep-breeder, innovator of farming technology and equipment, advocate of large-scale irrigation works, philanthropist, and member of the NSW Legislative Council. The McCaughey Mansion is also of technical significance as a rare example of Federation Arts and Craft / Free Style architecture constructed in an isolated rural context. The two remnant irrigation canals of the North Yanco irrigation scheme also have research potential for the information they can provide on the development of large-scale irrigation schemes in NSW and the engineering designs and technology involved.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nYAHS itself is important to the history and development of high school agricultural education in NSW. It is rare educational facility as the second oldest (1922) of the four specialist agricultural high schools established in NSW (the others being Hurlstone (1907), Farrer (1939), and [[James Ruse]] (1959)). Of these, it is the oldest continually occupied agricultural high school site in NSW (since Hurlstone was moved to Glenfield in 1926). The older historic buildings of this educational complex display how ideas, trends, and methods in agricultural and isolated residential education have changed and evolved in NSW from the early twentieth century through to today. They also display the rare nature of YAHS and how it has provided a combination of academic and technical based training since the early twentieth century. This provides this site with research potential, rarity, and representative values in a state context. Finally, YAHS has social significance to the rural families of the south and west of NSW for the role it has played in educating several generations of rural children, especially those from isolated properties.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nYanco Agricultural High School was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 7 June 2019 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nYAHS is of state historical significance due to the important role it has played in the history and development of large-scale irrigation schemes and agricultural education in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nThe McCaughey Mansion, its remnant landscaped gardens (including the artificial lake), pump display, two remnant canal sections, carriage way (now the main entrance road), and agricultural landscape are strongly associated with the earliest large-scale private irrigation scheme in the state. Between 1899-1903 Sir Samuel McCaughey constructed over 320km of irrigation canals on the North Yanco Holding to illustrate to the people and government of NSW that extensive irrigation was beneficial and essential to the development of agriculture and pastoralism in the drought prone west of NSW. Its success led to the commencement of the long-proposed MIA scheme which extended the North Yanco system. Today the MIA is a diverse food production area that contributes $5 billion to the Australian economy annually. The surviving range of features at YAHS displays both the first stage of the irrigation system (two remnant canal sections) and the results of its success (the mansion and landscaped gardens) that allows this important story to be effectively told.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nYAHS is of state historical significance as a unique example of a surviving public residential agricultural high school from the establishment of secondary specialist schools in NSW during the early twentieth century. YAHS is prominent in the history and development of agricultural high school education in NSW, especially as it catered for the agricultural families of the rural focussed south and west portions of the state. Of the four agricultural high schools established in NSW (Hurlstone (1907), Farrer (1939), and James Ruse (1959)), YAHS is the second oldest (established 1922) and retains its history and heritage as it has remained at the same site throughout its history (unlike Hurlstone). Its long term connection and association with its site means that the school complex demonstrates the progression of buildings, methods, ideas, and technology associated with the development of agricultural education in NSW throughout the twentieth and twenty first centuries. Since its establishment, YAHS has steadily grown, and evolved with educational trends and ideas so that it can deliver a regionally based, boarder only, agricultural education experience for boys and girls that is historically singular and unique in the state context. The fact that YAHS is strongly associated with the history and development of the MIA, as it was originally designed to provide farmers for this scheme, only adds to its historical significance. The way the school is also founded around the McCaughey Mansion and utilises the remnant irrigation works and agricultural landscape of the North Yanco Irrigation Scheme accentuates and deepens it historical connection to irrigation and agricultural in the regional and state sphere.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nYAHS has a strong historical association of state significance with Sir Samuel McCaughey (1835-1919). Sir McCaughey was a successful, prominent, and influential pastoralist and sheep-breeder, innovator of farming technology and equipment, advocate of large-scale irrigation works, philanthropist, and member of the NSW Legislative Council (1899-1919). Without his championing of the benefits, potential, and feasibility of large-scale irrigation schemes and his own personal effort (financing and drive) in demonstrating their effectiveness at North Yanco it is unlikely that the MIA scheme would have been undertaken. His efforts have led him to be remembered in the local region as the \"Father of Irrigation\". Sir McCaughey's interest and life's work in pastoralism and irrigation is clearly perceptible at YAHS at the McCaughey Mansion (his home from 1902-1919), its associated gardens and artificial lake, the two remnant canals, and surrounding agricultural landscape. The McCaughey Mansion also contains two items of movable heritage strongly associated with Sir McCaughey: a life sized portrait by Frederick McCubbin (1901) and his dress sword.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe McCaughey Mansion is of state technical significance as a unique example of a Federation Arts and Crafts / Free Style mansion constructed in an isolated rural context. Designed by the Sydney architect Herbert E. Ross, this mansion has far more in common with the large mansions erected on the Upper [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]] of Sydney than rural homesteads of this period. As such, this mansion is quite rare in the central and western districts of NSW. For Sir McCaughey it was a clear statement of his wealth and influence that allowed him to transport this type of metropolitan focussed architecture and high craftmanship to an isolated rural context.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nYAHS is of state social significance for the esteem it is held in by many rural families and communities across south and west NSW. Throughout its long history it has provided a valued education to the children of these families and has played an important educational role in this region. Since 1922 it has been a central boarding school for boys seeking to continue their family farms or move into other areas of the agricultural industry. From 1993 the school has also played an identical role for girls from the same families or those seeking an agricultural education. As such, many families in this region have a long association with the school that transcends generations and has expanded in the last 25 years to include female members. The school has a strong connection with past students through its old students' club, the Old Yanconians' Union (probably formed by the 1930s), who hold annual events at the school and are actively engaged in school life.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe remnant two canal sections (one extant, one archaeological) at YAHS have research potential in a state context for the information they can provide on the first stage of the North Yanco Irrigation Scheme. This private large-scale irrigation scheme was developed by Sir Samuel McCaughey from 1899-1903 to demonstrate the benefits, potential, and feasibility of extensive irrigation works to the people and government of NSW. The irrigation works around the McCaughey Mansion were likely the first constructed in the scheme and likely provide an important archaeological window into the initial methods and ideas used by Sir McCaughey in his irrigation works. These archaeological features could be compared and contrasted with the other remnant channels and irrigation works from the subsequent phases of the scheme preserved across other sections of the former North Yanco Holding. This potentially includes channels and irrigation works incorporated into the MIA that are still functioning today. In this manner, the archaeological remnants of the canal system and irrigation works at YAHS are potentially important archaeological resources in the study of the development of large-scale irrigation systems (and the excavation and pumping technology involved) in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nThe buildings, equipment, and archives of the school complex at YAHS have research potential in a state context for the information they can provide on the history and development of agricultural education in NSW. The way buildings from different periods are preserved at YAHS provides a window through which the changing and evolving ideas and thoughts about agricultural education in NSW from the 1920s through to the present can be appreciated. This could be an important resource for any study of agricultural education in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nYAHS is rare in a state context as the commencement site of the first private large-scale irrigation scheme in NSW. This rarity of YAHS is demonstrated by the McCaughey Mansion, its remnant landscaped gardens (including the artificial lake), pump display, agricultural landscape, and two remnant canals. These elements of YAHS are part of the first stage of the North Yanco irrigation scheme (1899-1903). The North Yanco scheme is particularly rare because it was a private enterprise in comparison to the other earlier small government sponsored schemes: the [[Curlwaa, New South Wales|Curlwaa]] Irrigation Area (1888) and Hay Private Irrigation District (1892-1893).<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nYAHS is rare in a state context as one of only four agricultural high schools ever established in NSW (Hurlstone (1907), Farrier (1939), and James Ruse (1959)). This rarity of YAHS is demonstrated by the older educational buildings on site and the later occupation phases of the older North Yanco era buildings. YAHS is the second oldest agricultural high school in NSW (established 1922). With the pending closure of the Glenfield site of [[Hurlstone Agricultural High School]] (scheduled for 2020) YAHS will soon become the oldest, continually occupied, agricultural high school site in NSW. YAHS's close association with the MIA (and irrigation), rural families in the south and west of NSW, its good condition, wide range of educational agricultural buildings, and isolated rural location strengthens its significance against this criterion.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nThe McCaughey Mansion is rare in a state context as an unusual example of a Federation Arts and Crafts / Free Style mansion in the central and western districts of NSW. Although modified, the Mansion retains many original features and its character. Its isolated rural context is rare and unusual in a state context as the majority of mansions of this architectural style are confined to the Sydney metropolitan area.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nYAHS is representative in a state context as an intact, well-preserved, and functional example of a rare type of specialist educational precinct in NSW. It contains a wide range of agricultural educational buildings and facilities from a variety of periods that display the progression and development of ideas about agricultural education in NSW from the 1920s to the present. As this site has been continually occupied from 1922 and YAHS is proud of its history and heritage it is an excellent representative example of an agricultural high school.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|Schools}}}}\n* [[List of government schools in New South Wales: Q-Z|List of government schools in New South Wales]]\n* [[List of selective high schools in New South Wales]]\n* [[List of boarding schools in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|editor1=Aitken, Ritchard |editor2=Looker, Michael |date=2002|title=The Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens}}  \n*  {{cite web |author=Barwick, W.

It is unknown if the YAHS grounds held any particular special, spiritual, or economic significance for the Wiradjuri people.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n=== British invasion and settlement ===\nWhat is today the [[Narrandera]] area was first invaded by European (mainly Irish) squatters during 1832-33. The Wiradjuri people who lived in this area are historically referred to as the Narrungdera. However, it is unknown if this is the correct name for these people. This invasion precipitated a war with the Narrungdera where the settlers were driven off their runs on several occasions throughout the rest of the 1830s and early 1840s before war and disease significantly reduced the Narrungdera population. However, they did not submit. Instead, they began moving throughout their lands keeping what tradition they could alive while also communicating and working for some of the friendlier settlers.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1>Gammage, 1986.</ref>{{rp|29-37}}\n\nThe Yonco run settled during this time by Thomas Small was originally the closest to what became the North Yanko headstation. During the frontier wars it was attacked several times, but it appears to have been one of the runs most persistently kept occupied. However, Small was defeated by these attacks and sold the property to James Thorn, perhaps as early as 1839-1840, who moved the headstation to the North Yanco area.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|29-37}}\n\nIn 1849 John Peter brought North Yanco from the Thorns. He appears to have had a good rapport with the Narrungdera or Wiradjuri as he employed around 50 to break in horses during the 1850s. At this time the region was experiencing a plague and the Narrungdera could break in up to 700 a year. In 1858 Peter sold the property to Alexander McNeil. Both Peter ad McNeil focused on breeding to improve their fleeces, and ultimately the prices of their wool, throughout their ownerships.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|42, 47, 53, 229}}\n\nThe North Yanco headstation was likely moved to its current (or long-term) location in 1870 after the terrible floods of that year forced pastoralists to re-evaluate their station infrastructure. This location appears to have been a good choice as during recent flooding (early 2000s) the main school centre has avoided being flooded.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|61}}\n\nBy 1881 North Yanco Station was owned by J. H. Douglas Esq. the local member for the district. It comprised around 95,000 acres and had a river frontage of 14 miles with an average depth back from the river of 25 miles. It stocked about 105,000 sheep and was known for the high quality of its wool. The gothic style homestead appears to have been located in the vicinity of the modern YAHS school complex. It was known as the \"the most perfect in this part of the district\" and featured a large garden, several acres in size. Fruit, vegetables, and flowers were grown in the garden which was watered by a wind-powered water lifter - it is likely that this piped water from the Murrumbidgee. Headstation complexes at this time in the district had become small villages with a variety of buildings and gardens and it appears North Yanco was no exception.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref>''[[Australian Town and Country Journal]]'', 23 April 1881, p24.</ref><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|79-80}}\n\nJames Henry Douglass was still owner in 1890 during the shearer's strikes, when the station had a board of 46 men and was worked by shearers from the union.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|94}}\n\n====Sir Samuel McCaughey's ownership of North Yanco and the North Yanco Irrigation Scheme (1899-1919/1920)==== \n[[File:Sir Samuel McCaughey's residence.jpg|thumb|left|[[Samuel McCaughey|Sir Samuel McCaughey]]'s residence, pictured in 1939, that now forms part of the school's facilities.]]\nSir [[Samuel McCaughey]] was born at Tullyneuh, near Ballymena in North Ireland on 1 July 1835. He was the eldest son of Francis and Eliza (nee Wilson) McCaughey. His father was a farmer and merchant and once he finished school he joined his father's linen business, where he learnt accounting and office management, while also working on the farm. His uncle [[Charles Wilson (Australian politician)|Charles Wilson]] convinced him to immigrate to Australia and he arrived in [[Melbourne]] in April 1856 to work on one of the properties ([[Kewell, Victoria|Kewell]]) owned by his other uncles John and Samuel (the Wilson Brothers) near [[Horsham, Victoria|Horsham]]. Starting as a general station hand he was appointed overseer two years later where he thrived due to his thrift, genial Irish humour, and kindness.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6>ADB</ref><ref name=nswshr-2021-2>Kelly, 1988</ref>{{rp|52}}\n \nBy 1860 he was able to convince his relations to back his purchase of a third share of Coonong, a 42,000 acre (16,997 ha) property near [[Urana]] in the [[Riverina]], in partnership with [[David Wilson (barrister)|David Wilson]] and John Cochrane. They initially suffered setbacks due to a lack of water, which perhaps encouraged McCaughey's interest in irrigation later in his life, but he persisted with the property, despite the withdrawing of his partners, which left him as sole owner in 1864. To solve his water problems McCaughey with his uncle Samuel Wilson deepened the Yanco Creek cutting and built dams. When he became partner in 1860 McCaughey also founded his sheep stud by purchasing old ewes descended from Tasmanian pure Saxon merinos from James Cochrane of Widegewa. From this time, he continued to improve the stud's quality by purchasing quality stock and sparing no expense in fencing and subdividing his paddocks.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/>\n\nMcCaughey's water conservation and sheep breeding schemes proved a success and he acquired the Singorimba and Goolgumbla properties later in the 1860s (or in 1870) and by 1872 held 137,000 acres (55,443 ha). In 1874 he brought his brother David (1848-1899) out to Australia to assist in the management of his properties. In 1881 he acquired [[Coree, New South Wales|Coree]], Toorale, and Dunlop from his uncle Samuel Wilson. However, he continued to live at Coonong and in 1876 built a large homestead with a garden and lake.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2/>{{rp|54}} \n\nBy the 1890s McCaughey had developed a keen interest in water conservation and he attempted to get more water for Coonong through additional dams on Colombo Creek or raising the heights of three dams on Yanko Creek in 1896. To undertake this work he brought over Irish workers who were used to wet and boggy working conditions. This act infuriated six downstream graziers who sued him and his brother in the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court]] in June 1898. McCaughey lost the case and the jury awarded 2000 pounds damages to the plaintiff and he was ordered to limit the height of his dams. The other plaintiffs were later compensated with 10,000 pounds and McCaughey paid 17,000 pounds in legal costs.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|104}} \n\nMcCaughey's inability to further his interests at Coonong encouraged him to purchase the North Yanco property in 1899 from Sir Charles Douglass for 220,000 pounds. At North Yanco, with its frontage on the Murrumbidgee, McCaughey felt that he could experiment with water conservation and irrigation measures without complaint from his neighbours. By this time he had also become convinced that large-scale irrigation schemes could materially benefit pastoralism in western NSW. To demonstrate this to the NSW public and government he determined to build such a scheme at North Yanco. This would demonstrate the possibilities of closer settlement based on intensive cultivation in dry areas while also increasing the station's sheep carrying capacity. The long-term goal of the plan was to subdivide North Yanko and establish irrigated farms for his employees and other settlers. To ensure the plan's success he decided to reside at North Yanco and oversee its development himself.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2/>{{rp|54}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9/>{{rp|87, 93}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-8>Review, 228</ref>\n\nIn the same year McCaughey was appointed to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|NSW Legislative Council]] by Sir [[George Reid]] to secure the passage of the [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] enabling bill. Reid valued McCaughey's experience and knowledge of land and McCaughey, who had no strong political leanings, was able to further some of his interests, such as large-scale immigration and, in time, irrigation schemes.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/>\n\nSir McCaughey initially worked on providing water for the gardens and grounds of his new mansion at the original homestead site. A system of irrigation channels was cut across the site and a pumping plant built on the [[Murrumbidgee River]] 400 yards to the south. A subterranean irrigation system was built around the homestead area by removing the topsoil to a depth of 18 inches, installing a layer of gravel, and laying the excavated soil over the top. Through this method the area was watered by soakage which allowed the establishment of a beautiful gardens and grounds. An artificial lake was also created on the east side of the grounds.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9>McCaughey, 2015</ref>{{rp|87}}\n \nSir McCaughey's new mansion was built between 1899-1902. When completed it featured two billiard rooms, lofty reception rooms, and ornate stained glass windows on the staircase and several doors. As part of his continued advocacy for irrigation he often used the mansion for the entertainment of visiting dignitaries, politicians, and other interested parties when they toured his irrigation works. He subsequently became renowned for his hospitality.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9/>{{rp|87}}\n\nFollowing the completion of the irrigation works for the mansion area, Sir McCaughey commenced work on the main scheme to provide irrigation to the majority of the North Yanco Holding (approximately 1899-1900?). During the disastrous 1902 drought he already had 60 miles of channels constructed which irrigated 750 acres of Lucerne and 250 acres of sorghum. By 1903 the system involved 320km (200 miles) of channels with weirs, regulators, and pumps (30 horsepower engine) that diverted water from three offtakes at Bundidgerry Creek (80km east of his homestead), Oak Creek (50km east), and Cowabbee Creek (60km northeast) allowing the irrigation of 16,200 hectares (40,000 acres). Excess water from the system was channelled back to the river by a continuation of Cudgell Creek, known as Cudgell Escape. The system spread almost to his northeast boundary, 100km west of the Bundidgerry creek intake. It mainly operated by gravitation but included at least one large rotary pump at the Pump Hole (at the end of Cudgell Escape). Traction engines and large scoops were used to excavate and maintain the irrigation system. Two of the engineers on the project were nephews of Sir McCaughey, Francis McCay and Alexander Stewart, that he had purposefully brought over from Ulster. Lucerne was the main grass grown as sheep fodder, but wheat, oaks, and potatoes were also cultivated. It proved to be a very successful and economical enterprise that allowed Sir McCaughey to prosper despite drought conditions. During the 1902 drought he also propped up the local/regional economy by offering work building channels to any man. Thus, by 1903 the station employed about 200 men. However, it is unclear how sustainable this farming method was across this landscape or land system as it may have quickly depleted the soil over the next five or ten years.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|80, 104}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9/>{{rp|87-89}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-8/>\n\nBeing a keen advocate of irrigation and a member of the NSW Legislative Council, Sir McCaughey, had greater plans for irrigation works in the region. In May 1903 he demonstrated to a Narrandera meeting that during the recent drought (1902) he had been able to grow sorghum 3-4m high and run 198 sheep a hectare using his irrigation scheme. This he argued, was a convincing reason to harness the Murrumbidgee River for irrigation. Consequently, in July 1903, Robert Gibson, the MLA of the [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]] district (and a colleague of Sir McCaughey), applied for leave to bring the Murrumbidgee Northern Supply and Irrigation bill before parliament that would finally implement part of the long-proposed [[Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area]] (MIA) scheme as a private enterprise.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|104-105}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9/>{{rp|89-90}}\n\n=====Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area=====\nAs an Interstate Royal Commission on the [[Murray River]] in 1902 had determined that large scale irrigation was an intercolonial question the NSW government felt that the issues this bill raised were a government matter. Consequently, the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Deaprtment]] considered various Murrumbidgee irrigation proposals throughout 1903-1904. Finally, in 1905, the government engineer L. A. B. Wade finalised an acceptable scheme that was basically a larger version of McCaughey's scheme. It involved building a dam across the Murrumbidgee at [[Burrinjuck Dam|Burrinjuck]], near [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], a weir at the Bundidgerry Creek intake, and a system of canals and water supply operating by gravitation between the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan Rivers. As the North Yanco scheme was already operational the MIA scheme could proceed by expanding its canal system on the plains west of Narrandera. Work began on this scheme (the MIA) by September 1905 when the Cudgel Creek cutting was commenced, which was opened on 25 April 1906. However, Wade's plan was not officially approved by the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] until 19 December 1906 when the Barren Jack Dam and Murrumbidgee Canals Construction Act was passed. Construction of [[Burrinjuck Dam]] began in February 1907 and Berembed Weir and the main canal at Narrandera in January 1908.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|105}}\n\nIn 1910 the NSW Government declared the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) with the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Act. The MIA was to have hundreds of new irrigation based farms and two new towns, [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] and [[Leeton, New South Wales|Leeton]], which were both designed by Walter Burley Griffin (and his wife?), the American (Chicago) architect who won the design competition for [[Canberra]]. The construction of Leeton began in 1911 and applications opened for the first 500 irrigation blocks in early 1912. Water was available to Yanco farms by July and by August 196 applicants were settled on their blocks. By March 1913 206kms of canals were completed which made 121,500 hectares available for irrigation. Industry continued to thrive in the MIA over the following years with a cannery and butter factory opening in Leeton and a bacon factory in Yanko. This early irrigation appears to have been sourced only from the regular flow of the Murrumbidgee as the Burrinjuck Dam was not completed enough to provide water to the MIA until 1917. It was finally completed in 1927.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|105}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9/>{{rp|89-90}}\n\nToday the MIA contains at least 3700 farms and 2500kms of canals. However, due to poor planning and the initial set-up of the scheme, it has never repaid the cost of its construction.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|106}}\n\nDuring Sir McCaughey's time the North Yanco headstation was supplied with a range of quality buildings. The men's huts are recorded to have had reading, dining, and bedrooms \"fit for a city club\". His blacksmith's workshop was of such quality that it produced machinery such as improved earth scoops for tank making, water wheels, ten furrow reversible ploughs, and combine harvesters. The headstation also featured wheelwright's and carpenter's shops, as well as an oil driven dynamo that produced electricity for the house and machine sheds. The orchard was based on 30cm of river sand packed at the bottom of trenches a meter deep.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|80}}\n\nThe majority of North Yanco, about 68,000 acres, was sold to the government for 3/10/- pounds an acre to construct the first stage of the MIA in June 1911. Sir McCaughey retained a life tenancy for 28,000 acres to the south of the Narrandera-Yanko railway allowing him to continue to reside at North Yanko. Sir McCaughey had already begun to dispose of his properties following the passing of the federal Land Tax Act in 1910. It is said that during Sir McCaughey's last years at North Yanco to celebrate his achievements he carved vinci - I conquered, over the door to his mansion. (McCaughey, 2015:89-90).<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|80, 105}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/>\n\nThe engineering workshops at North Yanko, besides producing vital equipment for the station and irrigation scheme, allowed Sir McCaughey to indulge his flair for inventing and experimenting with mechanical appliances. Although he had never taken an engineering course and employed several blacksmiths, he conducted much of the experimental work himself. Ultimately, he was responsible for the design and improvement of many farm implements. For instance, in NSW, he pioneered the use of heavy machinery for ploughing and soil excavation. He encouraged the use of mechanical devices on his other properties, which included the use of Wolseley machines for shearing at Dunlop in 1888. This was the first time shearing had been done completely mechanically in Australia.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-9/>{{rp|89}}\n\nSir McCaughey passed away on 25 July 1919 after a long battel with nephritis. He was buried in the churchyard of St John's Presbyterian Church in Narrandera. During his lifetime he became a giant of Australian pastoralism and his thrift, acumen, and generosity became legendary. King Edward VII conferred a knighthood on him in June 1905 in recognition of his contribution to the Australian wool industry and his numerous philanthropic and patriotic gifts. In 1911 when he began to sell his properties he was the largest sheep owner in Australia and owned over 1.7 million hectares in NSW and [[Queensland]]. At the time of his death his estate was worth over 1,600,000 pounds. The majority of this estate were philanthropic gifts to charities, religious organisations, schools, hospitals, and universities.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-1/>{{rp|80}}<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-6/>\n\nThe year following Sir McCaughey's death the remainder of the North Yanco property reverted to the control of the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission (WCIC).<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n===Yanco Agricultural High School (since 1922)=== \nDuring the late nineteenth century the study of, and training in, agriculture along scientific principles began to gain increasing attention in western societies. This style of education blossomed in Britain and North America prior to the 1880s and was associated with an interest in \"scientific farming\" which would assist agriculturalists in expanding upon their traditional ways using empirical knowledge. Agricultural colleges first appeared in Australia in the 1880s and were linked to the older interest in agriculture that had been expressed in the formation of Agricultural and Pastoral Societies and Experimental Farms that examined issues about acclimatisation, etc. The first Agricultural College in Australia was at Roseworthy in [[South Australia]], which was established in 1883. NSW soon followed this lead with the establishment of Hawksbury Agricultural College in 1891 by the NSW Department of Mines and Agriculture. These institutions were residential and espoused systematic and scientific approaches to farming. Education was provided through theoretical and practical lessons, experimental programs, and publications. These colleges appear to have been the catalyst for the establishment of Agricultural High Schools in NSW early in the twentieth century.<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-17>Atkin and Looker, 2002:12</ref><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-18/>{{rp|30}}\n\nIt appears that agricultural education was a low priority in the NSW education system for a time after the establishment of Hawksbury Agricultural College. This was due to the ready availability of a practical education in the pastoral community. This situation was rectified in the early twentieth century following a review of the education system in 1902-1903 which resulted in major reforms. These reforms were designed to keep NSW apace of advances in secondary education in the western world. A major part of the reforms was to improve the curriculum and increase the number of high schools while also providing continuation schools for students not qualified to enter high schools. The idea behind this reform was that post-primary education should be pre-vocational in nature. Agricultural high schools were a combination of these ideas providing academic schooling and grounding in the elementary theory and practice of agriculture.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-18>Brooks & Associates, 2009</ref>{{rp|30-32}}\n\nThe first Agricultural High School established in NSW was Hurlstone in 1907, which was located at [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]]. By 1915 this school had outgrown this site, but it was not until 1926 that it was relocated to a new site at [[Glenfield, New South Wales|Glenfield]]. In 1907 a Technical College was also opened at [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], which was a continuation school specialising in sheep, wool, and agriculture. In 1916 the Education department attempted to expand agricultural schooling by offering courses at five high schools: [[Albury]], [[Wagga Wagga]], [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Casino, New South Wales|Casino]], and Yass. These courses were not successful and necessitated the revision of agricultural education in NSW. The result of this revision was that Hurlstone would be moved to a new remote area (however, this did not occur until 1926) and a new agricultural high school would be established at Yanco.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-18/>{{rp|32-33}}<ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nThe [[Minister for Education (New South Wales)|NSW Minister for Education]], Tom D. Mutch, visited the Leeton area in 1920, possibly as part of a tour of the MIA. During this visit he met a deputation of local residents who petitioned him to establish a new Agricultural High School in the MIA to help educate boys in irrigation and agricultural techniques to prepare them for farming life here. The deputation (perhaps) suggested that the McCaughey Mansion, which had recently been left vacant by the death of Sir McCaughey, could be used for this purpose. Minister Mutch decided to champion this idea. The McCaughey Mansion was owned by the WCIC, but they were willing to provide this 636 acre property (two blocks 443 and 193 acres each) to the Department of Education for the new school for free in March 1921.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\">[[Department of Education (New South Wales)|NSW Department of Education]] documents</ref> \n\nYAHS was opened on 20 February 1922 with 60 residential students in the first intake (maximum capacity). This was 5 or 10 more students that the school had originally advertised for. Mr Ernest Breakwell (1922-1928) was the first headmaster and Mrs Breakwell the matron. Staff included two assistant teachers, an instructor in farm mechanics, a gardener, and a general hand. The school aims were to provide a three-year course in agriculture for boys culminating in the intermediate certificate. Students could then proceed to Hawksbury Agricultural College or go straight onto the land. It was to offer a sound general education in addition to specialised courses in agricultural sciences, as well as practical training in the field and workshop. The agriculture course was to have an emphasis on irrigation farming techniques due to the school's location in the MIA. An accompanying underlying aim of the school was to slow down, or even reverse, the drift of population from country areas into the cities. However, it could never hope to achieve this aim. To enter the school students needed to pass the competitive Qualifying Certificate offered at the end of Primary School.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nAt the time of the opening the school facilities were described as:<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n{{blockquote|'The main building is a two storied house built with brick walls and covered with a slate roof. This building has been converted into dormitories and dining rooms for the students, whilst a portion has been set apart for the Principal of the School. In this building ample kitchen and pantry accommodation is provided as well as quarters for the domestic helps, and very extensive verandahs and balconies. }}\n\nThe original bungalow in which the former owner once resided is a structure partly built of brick and partly of timber, and has extensive wide verandah all round. This building is also being utilised for students' dormitories and a common room, also for accommodating the teaching staff.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n \nThe two foregoing buildings will provide housing accommodation for the Principal and his family, the teaching staff and about sixty students.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nA brick building originally used for men's quarters has been converted into classrooms and science rooms, and another brick outbuilding has been fitted up with shower, baths, and lockers, so that the students after working in the field may bath and change their clothing before entering the main building.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nProvision has been made to install electric light in the principal buildings and also for outside lamps to light up the approaches in the vicinity of the main buildings' (DoE Documents).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThis is the story according to the official documents, but oral history from three of the original students recorded on a plaque at the school tells a different tale. According to this history the first students arrived on Friday 20 January 1922 and found the Mansion and ancillary buildings, including huge stables, stockyards, blacksmiths shops, mens' quarters, sawmill, two 800 ton haysheds, and large pumping station on the river, deserted and uncared for since 1919. As such, there were no beds, class rooms, or recreation facilities, and limited kitchen and messing facilities. Hurricane lamps provided light and meals were cooked over an open fire in the yard during the first months. Furthermore, there nearest neighbour was three miles away at the Yanco Experiment Farm. Despite the school not becoming co-education until 1993 (or 1995), Phillis Breakwell, the daughter of the Principal and Matron, was the first female student at the school as she was a member of the original class and finished the original three year course in 1924. This oral history also details that the life sized portrait of Sir McCaughey by McCubbin was donated to the school in 1923 by Mr Roy McCaughey of Coonong Station, near Narrandera.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=history/>\n\nOver the following years the school proved successful and improved and expanded facilities were required for increased demand. By 1927 the school land had been subdivided into 14 paddocks, dairy, pig, and sheep herds/flocks established and the school made self-sufficient in vegetables, milk, butter, and stock feed. The grounds and flower beds were well kept and remained beautiful and a source of admiration to all visitors. This resulted in the construction of the Mutch dormitory, principal's residence, and school hall in 1928, as well as the lease of an additional 151 acres. Sporting fields were also reportedly developed between the school and Euroley road to the west.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nOliver Gardiner was the second principal between late 1928 and late 1933. A School Council was formed in 1933 of parents, Old Yanconians, and community members. To this day this council has assisted in the running of the school (organising events, etc) and raising funds for works, equipment, etc, for the school.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nPercival Hindmarsh was the third principal of YAHS between 1934 and 1937. In 1934 the first fourth year class was established at the school during the transition from a three year course at the school to a five year which culminated in the normal high school Leaving Certificate Examination (in 1935). This five year course differed only from the ordinary high school course by the substitution of agriculture for Latin. Thus, the English, History, Mathematics, French, and Elementary Science courses were the same as those taught in normal high schools. The agricultural courses covered the principles and practice of agriculture, entomology, agricultural botany, soil physics, and wool-classing (which was very popular). To enable agriculture to be comprehensively taught an intensively cultivated model farm was developed on site that included a dairy and dairy herd, piggery and pig (herd), sheep flock, 30 acres of irrigated pastures (five paddocks of 6 acres), 28 acres of crops (lucerne and ceral crops), 5-6 acres of vegetables, orchard, and poultry yard and flock. The operations of the school farm were carried out by the students under the supervision of their teachers, with students doing an average of seven hours of practical work a week. The school's goal was to be self-sufficient and it was already self-sufficient in milk and vegetable, and partially in meat and butter. During this time a sporting house system was introduced at the school and an annual Beach Carnival inaugurated by Jack Woods, a teacher and former [[Sydney]] surf life-saver (Bill Barwick History).<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nIn 1934 the construction of residences for the school dairyman and gardener were approved when funds were available. It is not known if and where these residences were established. At this time the school also required a drying cabinet to dry laundry in wet conditions which would be installed in the current laundry building, as well as a portable classroom for the new 4th year class. Planning was also underway to construct a new stable buildings, implement and hay sheds, as well as a tub silo. It is unclear if these buildings were constructed. A new classroom block was also being planned, which would be built on the site of the existing stables. In 1935 the old blacksmith's shop (McCaughey's forge room) was demolished and a new building erected for woodworking and metal work (black smithing). When constructed it was a wooden building with iron roofing (the \"Hackey\" building). This building was constructed to bring the schools blacksmithing and manual training utilities up to standard. During the 1930s the school enrolment was between 180-200 students making the school one of the largest residential schools in the state. The school had its own water supply and a sewerage treatment plant (using a septic tank).<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nJames McEwan King was the fourth principal of YAHS between 1938 and 1945. His tenure saw the further consolidation and development of the school and its ill-fated name change which was part of a wider policy by the Department of Education. In October 1939 the school name was changed to McCaughey Memorial High School by the Minister for Education, D. H. Drummond. This unpopular change lasted two years until the name was changed back to Yanco Agricultural High School in October 1942 after a change of Government. A new two-storey classroom block was also constructed at the school in 1939 to provide state of the art agricultural science laboratories, as well as some office space for the staff. This building replaced the classrooms in McCaughey's former shearing quarters. When constructed it was described as a two-storey brick structure with tile roof and the following facilities:<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n'On the ground floor: 4 standard classrooms each 25 ft. 6 in. by 22 ft. 6 in., a Science Laboratory 45 ft. x 22 ft. 6 in. with Preparation Room off same 22 ft. 6 in. x 8 ft. Staff Room, a Store Room, Switch Room, Plant Room, etc. Two staircases (of fireproof construction) provide access to the First Floor which duplicates the accommodation on the Ground Floor, the Laboratory being for Biological purposes in this case.'<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n'The new School Building is equipped with \"A petrol spirit hollow-wire Distribution System\", for the provision of burners to benches in the Science and Biological Laboratory respectively'.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nThe staff compliment in the late 1930s was the headmaster, three graduates in agricultural science, five graduates in other subjects, and instructors in Farm Mechanics, Farm Practices, and Horticulture. A new sanitary block was also constructed around this time and by the late 1930s a silo, shearing plant, and stables as well. At this time the school was described as comprising \"a main building with the T. D. Mutch building attached, utilised for dormitories for about 200 pupils, the commissariat department, and a library, a classroom block containing 6 classrooms and a laboratory, and a number of minor buildings comprising one for the maids\" quarters, one for the field staff, an assembly hall, a blacksmith and manual training block, dairy and piggery, and a separate residence for the Principal'. By the end of the 1930s the school grounds were 779 acres of which 161 acres were leased. Academically, the school boasted that its students were probably better equipped for farming than those of Hawksbury Agricultural College considering its all-round curriculum. However, the majority of students (around 70%) who graduated from YAHS returned to their family farms rather than matriculate to Hawksbury Agricultural College.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nThe success of YAHS up to this period appears to have encouraged the establishment of another agricultural high school in the north of the state at [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] in 1939. This was named Farrier Memorial Agricultural High School. From this period onwards Yanco catered for the agricultural families of the south and west of the state, Farrier the north, and Hurlstone the greater metropolitan region. Besides these high schools many other rural schools offered agricultural courses during this period.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> WWII stretched the resources of the school as the armed forces recruited former students, teaching, and farm staff. However, the school fought to weather wartime deprivations and also had an active student cadet unit throughout the war.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nThomas Mason was the fifth principal of YAHS between 1946 and 1947 who commenced an annual gala day and fireworks display in March 1947. The goal of this annual event was to raise funds for a school war memorial. Mason was followed by Richard Jane who remained principal for ten years (1948 and 1958). School problems and issues in 1955 included a proposed swimming pool (and funding issues) and the establishment of a filtration plant for the school's drinking water supply. Planning was also underway to construct a new dormitory block, a separate sick bay, the extension of the library on the ground floor of the McCaughey House, convert the existing sick bay to a reception room (in McCaughey House?), extend the dining room in the Mason building to accommodate 300 students, and the construction of a store. Some of these planned improvements definitely occurred over the following decade, while it is unclear if others were carried out. Enrolments between 1955-1957 were 202-216 boys.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nIn the mid-1950s agricultural science continued to be a part of the broader curriculum of the NSW Education system. It was part of the natural science section of the primary school curriculum. At high school level agricultural courses were available in agriculture, agricultural biology, and farm mechanics at more than 80 country schools. However, only three Agricultural High Schools were operating that supplied a specialist education in this area, Hurlstone (1907), Yanco (1922), and Farrier Memorial (1939), that also supplied their students with a first-rate general education. The focus on this area in the NSW education system was related to the contemporary perception that the future of the state would depend largely on the extension and development of its agricultural resources. Therefore, specialist schools such as these were necessary to provide a proper education for potential farmers.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nFollowing the end of World War II the YAHS community chose to memorialise this devastating event through the construction of some sort of feature on the school grounds. However, it took some time for the idea of a swimming pool to be settled on and for the necessary funds to be gathered. It might not have been until 1956 until this occurred and the initial excavation undertaken for the pool. Unfortunately, construction did not begin straight away and in the interim the excavation was used as a school cadet shooting range (this was a common school community/activity group post-war). Construction finally began in 1958 with the pool being completed in 1961. Mr Richard Giltinan (1959-1973) was the headmaster at this time and the school enrolment 223 and staff compliment of 15. This included four teachers of English, History, and Geography, four teachers of Science, two teachers of Mathematics, one French teacher, two Farm Mechanics teachers, one Physical education teacher and Sportsmaster, and one visiting Sheep and Wool Instructor. As such the school curriculum consisted of English, History, Geography, French, Mathematics, Elementary Science, Agricultural Science, and specialised agricultural subjects including Farm Mechanics and Woolclassing.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nThe continued success of the school to the 1960s required further extensions of its facilities including two additional dormitory wings (29 April 1965), the John Walsh Hospital block (1963), a teachers' common room (1963), a garage (1963), an extension to the dining room (1963 - Mason Dormitory?), and four demountable classrooms.<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-19>May 1969</ref> \n\nThe early 1960s extensions cost a total of approximately 250,000 pounds and the two new dormitory wings were named after the first two principals of the school, Breakwell and Gardiner. They eased severe overcrowding in the former school dormitories. By the late 1960s the school enrolment had grown to 325 boys with a staff of 21 teachers. Other social aspects of the school had crystallised by this time including the school motto ''Ut Sementem Feceris Ita Metes'' which is a quotation from St Paul's New Testament Epistle to the Galatians meaning \"As You Sow, So Shall You Reap\". The school colours were royal blue and gold and it had four houses for sporting activities and academic competition. These houses were named after early personalities associated with the establishment of the school, McCaughy, Mutch, Breakwell, and Gardiner.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nBy the mid-1960s the Old Boy's Union, the Yanconians, was meeting regularly and assisting the School Council in working bees, as well as providing funds for school features such as memorials. For instance, they provided a granite memorial commemorating all the Yanconians who served in the armed forces during WWII. The School Council working bees also assisted in the development of new sporting fields to the north of the Principals Residence.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nIn 1971 the school was finally provided with a library building which it had been in want of at least since the early 1960s. This library was a type built at many schools at the time and was a combined library and science laboratory building funded by a [[Australian Government]] initiative. In 1976 the school was also supplied with another dormitory, Hindmarsh House, which was built to provide single room study facilities for students studying for Year 12. To ease fast staff turnover rates the school was also supplied with additional staff facilities and accommodation that could provide for married and single staff. By 1977 the school was also beginning to contemplate the possibility of the school becoming co-educational due to society's changing attitudes to single-sex education.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nMr A. I. Bond was Principal in 1982 when the school had a staff of 27 and 281 enrolments. By this time the school had several problems including student and staff accommodation, the dilapidated condition of the classroom block (1939), staffing formula, and rising cost of fees. Most importantly the school continued to considering whether it would become a co-educational school. Unlike Hurlstone, which was forced to rapidly transfer to co-education in 1979, YAHS was allowed time to consider and plan for this change. While only being a partial step in this direction, the school completed a new dining room and kitchen facility in 1988. This dining room could accommodate 400 students and was an important new facility for the school.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/> \n\nThe government announced the coming of co-education to YAHS in September 1991. This change was to be accompanied by a substantial building program to provide the necessary facilities for girl students. This included the Mason dormitory (90 students), the music and arts classroom blocks, and technological and applied studies block. Mutch House was also substantially renovated during this development so that it provided accommodation for sixty students and the medical centre extended. In January 1993 the first female students were enrolled in the school (75) across Years 7 to 11. Full co-education was achieved in 1996. These developments were undertaken with the maintenance of the schools character in mind and the preservation of the rural openness of its setting being a priority. As such, this development appears to have taken place with heritage issues in mind while also seeing to the needs of modern educational needs.<ref name=nswshr-2021/><ref name=\"DoE\"/>\n\nA new piggery and breeding complex were built in the early 1990s using funds from the sale of the school's dairy cattle and its milk quota. The swimming pool and school hall were also the focus of major refurbishment projects in the late 1990s. More recently, the school's tennis courts were upgraded to be a playing surface for tennis and netball all year round and supplied with lighting. In 2007 the school received a major new facility with the construction of an Equine and Show Stock Centre.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nToday the school's highly successful show stock team prepares and exhibits cattle at regional, state, and interstate shows. The school's highly successful equestrian students participate in gymkhanas across the state and take on the role of a ceremonial honour guard for vice-regal and other important occasions. The schools charter has a focus on \"a strong sense of Scholarship, responsible Leadership, Personal Integrity, Citizenship and competitive Sportsmanship\" and it continues to provide a comprehensive co-educational residential experience in a rural setting for students from isolated areas in the state. The school has a long and extensive academic, agricultural, and sporting traditions and has achieved a measure of distinction in public examinations and competitions. Its sporting success includes local and state competitions including the Buchan Shield in Rugby Union and the University Shield, six times, in Rugby League. With this history and continuing endeavour and succuss YAHS is held in high esteem by the local and rural communities of NSW.<ref name=history/><ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n== Description == \n=== General context === \nYAHS comprises a large complex of approximately 50 educational and residential buildings on a 280 hectare property southwest of Yanco in Central NSW on the north bank of the Murrumbidgee River. The school is a co-educational, fully residential, high school specializing in agriculture. The school land includes 180ha for intensive irrigation and dry land agriculture and 60ha of natural (regrowth) bushland.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThe school property is bounded on its north and west sides by Euroley Road and its road reserve (which differ in some places), the Murrumbidgee River on its south side, and part of the Murrumbidgee Valley National Park on its east side. Another part of the national park lies to the west of Euroley Road on the west side of the school. As such, the school property lies between a corridor of the national park along the north side of the Murrumbidgee River. To the north of the school over Euroley Road are farm lands of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThe school has been described to have \"rural charm\" and be located in \"picturesque surroundings on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River\".<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nOver its history the school has been effectively a self-contained local community with its own distinct social structure and organisation. It has had its own recreation, health, education, sporting, and cultural spaces, as well as its own utilities, including electricity, water, and sewerage. As such, it is a very distinct and unusual type of educational facility in the NSW education system (Old Yanconians' Union Submission).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n=== School grounds and layout === \nThe extensive YAHS property comprises a number of different landscapes. The main building complex is situated around the original North Yanco Homestead in the southern centre of the school property. This complex comprises four main blocks with extra buildings along the fringes. The dormitories, general classrooms, and main admin centres are in the eastern two blocks while the specialist agricultural buildings are in the western two blocks. The teacher's residences are generally on the southeast fringe of the complex and the sports facilities on the northeast fringe.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nTo the southwest of the main building complex is a sewerage treatment facility and via a road to the south a smaller complex of five-six buildings which may be the water treatment plan. Along the banks of the Murrumbidgee are also two interwar period (1930s) teacher's residences.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThe main complex is connected to Euroley Road through a main entrance road (east) and a service road (west). The main entrance road leads from the northeast corner of the property to the front of the McCaughy Mansion and connects to the road to the south of the dormitories. This road features white gates and a traffic island with restored ploughs or other farming machinery. These decorative gates were constructed by staff and students during the mid-1930s in the original school workshop (a McCaughey period building) (Old Yanconian Union Submission). This road may be the original carriageway from the McCaughey period. It also features mature tree plantings along its length. The service road commences a few hundred metres to the west of the main entrance road adjacent a functioning canal. It follows this canal through much of the school property and runs through the centre of the main complex before heading towards the banks of the Murrumbidgee near the two interwar teacher's residences.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nTo the east and west of the main school complex are two creeks: Guises Creek to the west and an unnamed creek to the east. Both these creek lines appear to be intermittent. The creek to the east appears to have been converted into a canal during the North Yanco Irrigation Scheme (1899-1903). The agricultural fields of the school appear to lie between these two creeks. The landscape to the east of the main access road and the unnamed creek is forested (regrowth) and merges into the Murrumbidgee Valley National Park to the east. This forest is known as the boys' forest. The landscape to the west of Guises Creek rises gently and appears to be used for pasture or equestrian riding/training, but it is mostly cleared except for regrowth forest along the creek line. This forest is known as the girls' forest. There appears to be a former paddock to the west of the south portion of the creek. The agricultural fields lie mainly to the north of the school complex to either side of a still functioning canal from the North Yanco Irrigation Scheme. A small triangular orchard is located to the north of the agricultural blocks of the school complex. Agricultural fields or grazing land lies to the south of the school complex between it and the river.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nDirectly to the north of the school gymnasium to the west of the main entrance road are several sporting ovals which were built in the early 1960s. This area was previously an orchard and farming area (Old Yanconian Union Submission).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n====Buildings and capacity====\nIt had an enrolment of over 370 students in 2012 and has reached its accommodation capacity. It has a class block (known as \"the Old Class block\") because of its age. The classblock has eight classrooms, a science lab, a computer lab, the English staffroom, and the Maths staffroom. There is a Technical and Applied Studies block which contains a TAS staffroom, three classrooms, a cooking room, a computer lab, and at the end (a demountable) an ex-science lab, now used as a classroom. There are woodwork and metalwork rooms in a building known as \"the Hackey\". There is another class block (known as \"the New Classblock\" or the \"Brian Roberts Classblock\"), which contains an Art/Music staffroom, HSIE staffroom, three classrooms, a music room, art rooms, and soon to be computer lab. There are offices in the historic McCaughey house.\n\nThere are 12 dormitory buildings (Mutch, Gardiner, Breakwell, Hindmarsh, Mason, Gosper, Eadis, Hyatt, Hilton and the pods ) where students sleep; girls and boys are separated from access after certain times.\n\n=== Cultural landscapes === \nThe YAHS property has two distinctive cultural landscape layers which are of state significance. They are associated with the following historical periods of use of the site:<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n# North Yanco Irrigation Scheme (1899-1903): an extensive irrigation system built on the large North Yanco Holding (1830s-1919) to demonstrate the benefits and feasibility of irrigation to the NSW public and government;<ref name=nswshr-2021/> and\n# YAHS (1922-current): an agricultural high school, closely associated with irrigation, and established to support the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n====North Yanco Holding period buildings and landscape features====\nThe current school complex contains several buildings and landscape features dating to the North Yanco Holding period of occupation of the site. All these buildings and landscape features were adapted to serve educational functions when YAHS opened in 1922.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThe centrepiece of the school complex is the North Yanko Mansion (1899-1902), built by Sir Samuel McCaughey (B00A). It is a large two-storey Federation Arts and Crafts / Free Style mansion designed by the Sydney architect Herbert Ernest Ross (1868-1937). It is built of red brick with imitation [[sandstone]] trimming made of render/plaster or concrete. Each floor features a surrounding two-storey [[Veranda|verandah]] which is arched on the ground floor and columned on the first floor. It has projecting central [[gable|gables]] on three [[Facade|facades]] and a [[Hipped roof|hipped]] slate roof with a small central [[turret]]. When constructed the building was tastefully and expensively fitted out with a high standard of craftmanship which led it to be described \"as one of the most palatial and most modern homesteads\".<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-20>ATCJ, 1906</ref> \n\nAlthough the building is now used for school administration it retains many original Federation period features such as Wunderluch [[Pressed metal ceiling|pressed metal ceilings]] (different types in each room), tiled floors, [[marble]] fireplaces, grand timber staircase, metal and timber fittings, plaster decorations, and stained glass windows. The main stained glass window above the grand timber staircase was designed by Herbert Ross and manufactured by F. Ashwin & Co. of 314 Pitt Street, Sydney. Much of the school's history is displayed or stored in the building including the portraits of the former principals.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nA number of pieces of movable heritage are also stored at YAHS including:<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* A life size oil portrait of Sir Samuel McCaughey in full court dress painted by Frederick McCubbin in 1901. A plaque in the school with oral history from three of the original students at the school details that this portrait was donated to the school in 1923 by Mr Roy McCaughey of Coonong Station, near Narrandera. This portrait with its frame and case was restored in 2004 with funds supplied by a generous Old Yanconian.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> A dress sword owned by Sir Samuel McCaughey.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* A large collection of school memorabilia including honour rolls, framed prints, school magazines, photographs, trophies, ribbons, etc.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* A number of pieces of historic engineering equipment from the McCaughey period, as well as items used at the agricultural school.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* Sir Samuel McCaughey's Pump, a restored memorial feature - originally part of the main supply source for the North Yanco irrigation system on Cudgel Creek.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nWhen the McCaughey Mansion was originally constructed it was surrounded to the east by landscaped gardens and an artificial lake (1899-1902). It is possible that these garden was designed by McCaughey and symmetrical in layout (Old Yanconians Union Submission). This garden space is extant, but it does not appear that many of the individual trees and plantings date to the original planting scheme. However, this area is still significant as a green space and it also contains some school memorials. The artificial lake retains two islands, a disused aviary, and a foot bridge which appear to be consistent with its original design although the foot bridge for instance has been replaced. The current Parents and Citizens Association of the school notes that the school gardens have been landscaped to conform to the original garden beds and that they are upgraded to conform with what is known of the original flowers and plantings of the McCaughey period gardens (submission).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nAt least two early branch canals of the North Yanco Irrigation Scheme are extant which were once integrated into the school agricultural works. One of these is visible and still functioning to the east of the service road. It once extended along the west side of the school complex running parallel to this road, all the way to the Murrumbidgee River. To the north of the school complex this canal is mostly extant, particular with distance from the school buildings, and along one section is lined with mature tree plantings. It has been destroyed by new buildings throughout the school complex. To the south of the school complex it is present archaeologically in the agricultural field between the complex and the interwar teacher's residences along the Murrumbidgee River. The other remnant canal appears to be a modified creek. It is located in the western verge of the bushland to the east of the school complex (within the school grounds). To the north of the school property it runs parallel to the eastern access road to the school complex.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nIt is possible that the current school laundry building (B00L) dates to the North Yanco Holding period (between 1902 and 1917) based on photographic evidence (a Kerry & Co photograph). It is a L-shaped render covered brick building with a hipped (gambrel form) [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]] roof with the northern wing being a later extension. When YAHS opened the building was converted into a shower room for the students. Over its life it has served many functions including the boys shower room, boiler room, vegetable store room, canteen, and laundry. The boiler was originally fired by coal, but has been converted to new fuels over time including wood, oil, LPG, and natural gas. When the conversion to natural gas occurred, the entire building was converted into an extended laundry (maybe the north wing was added at this time) and the western section retained for use as a Maintenance workshop. This workshop remained in the building until 2000 when a new workshop was constructed in the school complex. Today the building is fitted out as a commercial type laundry facility in order to serve the school's large (300 pupils plus staff) laundry needs. As such, the building interior contains little original fabric.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n==== YAHS buildings ==== \nThe following YAHS buildings are within the SHR curtilage for this item. They constitute the remaining buildings from the historic periods of construction at the school, as well as the later larger dormitory buildings within the main block of the school complex.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nFrom the original conversion of the North Yanco Holding buildings into an educational complex in 1921-22 the Department of Education has continued to add new buildings to meet the expanded needs of the school. This includes upgrading existing buildings to meet changing educational needs. From 1927 all the buildings were built by the Department of Education or Public Works and were often constructed during short phases of improvement and expansion works (see history).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nAfter a few years of successful operation, the school facilities were expanded with a number of new buildings in 1927. These all survive on site (although they have continued to be modified to suit new educational needs):<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The School Hall<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-21>B00H - 1927</ref> is a rectangular brick building with front [[portico]] and rear back-stage extension. It has a peculiar form of tiled gable roof. Instead of the roof lines meeting at an apex the top of the roof slopes down on a 45 degree angle. The front and rear sides of the building are decorated with painted rendered feature panels (or [[columns]]). The north side of the building also features three [[Emergency exit|emergency exits]] which are likely modern alterations. The hall is the centre of many social or formal activities for the school including examinations, assembles, community events, performances, and meetings. It also houses a large range of the schools Honour Rolls which are considered to be a rich part of its history. It was the subject of a major refurbishment project in the late 1990s.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The Principals Residence (1927) is a rectangular roughcast rendered brick building with a tiled hipped roof, and wide, flat roofed verandah around its north, east, and south sides. The verandah is supported by rendered columns and has been \"filled-in\" at its northern end with [[weatherboard]] walls to build additional rooms. It looks to have been designed to be basically symmetrical along the front facade, although the three [[chimneys]] are asymmetrically placed. It appears that over time when renovations have occurred to the McCaughey Mansion, fireplaces that have been removed from this building have been placed in this residence. Consequently, each of its three fireplaces has a fine marble federation style fireplace. Many original features of this building are intact, however, it requires appropriate refurbishment and maintenance works.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The Mutch Dormitory<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-22>B00D - 1927</ref> was the first purpose-built student accommodation building constructed at the school. It is attributed to the NSW Government Architect Seymour Wells by the National Trust (NSW). It is a L-shaped two storey building with a hipped CGI roof. It is primarily built of brick, but across its north exterior and south and east interior facades it has long sections of brick columns supporting first storey cream weatherboard wall sections. These features form deep verandahs for the ground floor of the building and corridors above. This building contained the school kitchen and dining room on its ground floor from its construction (1927) until the James McEwan King Dining Room was completed in 1988. In the early 1990s (prior to 1993) this dormitory was substantially renovated to provide accommodation for sixty students as part of the preparation for co-education. Perhaps when the Gardiner Dormitory was built in the early 1960s the south wing of the Mason dormitory was extended by two [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] in the same style. Today its ground floor contains teachers' offices and its first floor is a girls' dormitory. The dormitory rooms are very simple with [[linoleum]] floors and no fixed room dividers and set-up with six beds, chests, and movable room dividers. Students are free to decorate their dormitories as they see fit.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> Of this set of building the School Hall and Mutch Dormitory display a similar design palate of bare brick highlighted with cream features weather this be plaster columns or weatherboard. The Principal's Residence has a different design palate, although it does feature cream rendered brick walls (it lacks the bare brick walls of the other buildings).<ref name=nswshr-2021/> In the mid-1930s another round of school expansion occurred which appeared to be associated with providing new and upgraded teaching facilities to replace those that had had previously been fitted into McCaughey period buildings (Shearers' quarters and blacksmiths workshop). This included:<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The \"Hackey\" (B00N) - Industrial Arts Block (wood and metal working) - built in 1935. It is a L-shaped timber (perhaps a form of weatherboard) building with CGI gable roof. It was designed and built as a temporary educational building. It was initially nicknamed \"The Morgue\" by students after H. J. Morgan, the manual arts teacher between 1944 and 1945. It was later renamed \"The Hackey\" after H. Kaplin, the industrial arts teacher between 1955 and 1958. Today, this building continues to be used to teach wood and metal technical subjects and the metal area was upgraded in 2012 with funds provided by the Australian Government Trade Training Centre initiative. This is an open plan building with movable teaching benches and a range of woodworking and metalworking equipment. The building also features a large ventilation system which seems to have its exterior vent as a hood on the peak of the north wing.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* In 1939 the Old School Block (B00F) was built to provide new classrooms and laboratory facilities. It is attributed to Cobden Parks, NSW Government Architect by the National Trust (NSW). It is a two storey L-shaped brick building that originally contained eight classrooms, a downstairs office for teaching staff, an upstairs office for the deputy principal and subject heads, and two science/agricultural laboratories. It appears to continue in use for general learning today with there being no specialist laboratories in the building. The building interior is painted a pale blue and is in a fair condition with perhaps some original features. Air conditioning has been added to the building and this has resulted in a large system of vents on the south exterior (and perhaps the west exterior). The [[foundation stone]] for this building was laid on 19 December 1938 by the Minister for Education, the Hon. D. H. Drummond.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* Two weatherboard teacher's residences were built along the Murrumbidgee River banks during the interwar period, probably the 1930s. They have hipped CGI roofs, verandahs, and a cream exterior paint scheme. They were originally built to provide accommodation for clerical and administrative staff as the unsealed roads to the school were often impassable due to wet weather at this time (Old Yanconians Union Submission). It appears that the east canal across the school grounds originally passed between these two residences before connecting with the Murrumbidgee River. Today they continue to be used as staff accommodation.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nAnother period of school expansion occurred during the 1960s. Within the SHR curtilage this phase is represented by:<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The War Memorial swimming pool, built between 1958 and 1961, and its amenities block, built in 2012, which was funded by YAHS P&C.; This pool was built to contemporary Olympic swimming standards. It was opened by the Member for Murrumbidgee, the Hon. A. G. Enticknap. The pool filtration plant was decorated with a mural in 1968 by the local artist Mrs A. Campbell, whose sons attended the school. The mural features an agricultural theme and depicts the goddess, Ceres, with sheaves of grain along with other mythological features. Major repairs were undertaken on the pool in the mid 1990's, costing over $100,000, to prevent leakage and extend the pool's life.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The Breakwell and Gardiner Dormitories<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-23>B00G/B00E - 1961-1963</ref> are two-storey brick L-shaped buildings of the same design. They were built to expand the accommodation facilities of the school. These two L-shaped double storey buildings originally contained three dormitories (housing 144 students), shower and toilet facilities, and two teacher rooms on each floor. These buildings may have been finished in 1963, but they were not officially opened until 29 April 1965 by the Hon. A. G. Enticknap, M.L.A. and Minister for Agriculture and Conservation. Similar to the Mutch dormitory, today these dormitory rooms are simple, being large rooms with movable bed furniture. Each floor may also contain a kitchenette or TV room.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n* The Dr John O'Walsh Memorial Hospital Block<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-24>B00C - 1963/4</ref> is a single storey brick rectangular building. It features an older section and a more modern extension dating to when co-education was introduced (1993). It remains in use as a sick bay or medical centre today. This building was constructed during 1963 and occupied early in 1964. When opened it featured a matron's quarters, two wards, a casualty room, kitchen and toilet facilities.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThe SHR curtilage also features two buildings constructed during the 1970s which may or may not be of heritage significance.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> The Library and Science Block<ref name=nswshr-2021-2021-25>B00B - 1971</ref> is a square brick building with a tiled roof. It was opened by the NSW Minister for Education, C. B. Cutler, on 6 August 1971. Its construction was part of a federal government initiative to provide library facilities and science laboratories to high schools across Australia. It is of a fairly common Department of Education design from this time period, and perhaps this program, known as a \"liblab\" building. It still serves these same functions today.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nIn 1975/76 the Hindmarsh Dormitory (B00J) was built in the southwest corner of the main block of the school complex. It is a three-storey \"L-shaped\" brick building. However, its design is somewhat multi-level with different sections being built on slight offsets (so they look diagonal from above) and with sloped roofs at different heights. It was built to provide single room accommodation for final year students preparing for their HSC. This building was named after Percival Hindmarsh the third principal of YAHS (1934-1937). This building may have been a singular original design from the NSW Government's Architect's office and school oral history notes that it received an award for its design. The NSW government architect at the time was G. P. Webber, but the name on some of the plans held at the school are P. P. Kerl?<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nFinally, the SHR curtilage contains three building built from the 1990s onwards. These buildings are unlikely to be of heritage significance.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nThe music and arts block (or general learning building (B00I) was built 1992/1993 in the northwest corner of the main teaching/dormitory block as part of the preparation for co-education. This appears to be a L-shaped two storey brick building with a corrugated iron hipped roof. It features a raised first storey verandah on the interior side of the L. This building was designed by the Department of Public Works.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\nOn the north side of the school complex is also a school gymnasium (B00U) and changerooms (B00Y). These are brick, flat roofed buildings. The gymnasium is two-storey. It is unknown exactly when these buildings were constructed.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> \n\n=== Condition === \n\nAs at 12 October 2018, Buildings on site are generally in a fair to good condition.<ref name=nswshr-2021/> West canal (still active) is in a good condition. Its southern archaeological sections are visible on satilite imagery. East canal (archaeological) is in a good condition. It is visible on the ground as a straight drainage feature with embankments on either side. It features unusual tree regrowth in a straight alignment on either side.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Yanco Agricultural High School War Cry<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yancoag-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/our-school/war-cry |title=About our school: War Cry |work=Yanco Agricultural High School |publisher=[[Department of Education (New South Wales)|NSW Department of Education]] |date=n.d. |access-date=19 February 2018 }}</ref> was chanted by the Mayor of the town of Paris during the town ball in the 1974 [[Peter Weir]] movie, ''[[The Cars That Ate Paris]]''.\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 28 July 2017, Yanco Agricultural High School (YAHS) is of state significance for its historic, associative, technical, social, research, rarity, and representative values. This site, which was originally the homestead complex of the North Yanco Holding, retains several rare features from this period including the McCaughey Mansion, its remnant landscaped gardens (including the artificial lake), carriage way, pump display, two remnant irrigation canals, and agricultural landscape. These features display how the North Yanco Holding played an important role in the history of large-scale irrigation schemes in NSW as the starting point of the North Yanco irrigation scheme developed by Sir Samuel McCaughey between 1899 and 1903. The success of this scheme led the NSW government to undertake the long-proposed Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) scheme in 1906. Through these features the site is strongly associated with Sir Samuel McCaughey (1835-1919), a successful, prominent, and influential pastoralist and sheep-breeder, innovator of farming technology and equipment, advocate of large-scale irrigation works, philanthropist, and member of the NSW Legislative Council. The McCaughey Mansion is also of technical significance as a rare example of Federation Arts and Craft / Free Style architecture constructed in an isolated rural context. The two remnant irrigation canals of the North Yanco irrigation scheme also have research potential for the information they can provide on the development of large-scale irrigation schemes in NSW and the engineering designs and technology involved.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nYAHS itself is important to the history and development of high school agricultural education in NSW. It is rare educational facility as the second oldest (1922) of the four specialist agricultural high schools established in NSW (the others being Hurlstone (1907), Farrer (1939), and [[James Ruse]] (1959)). Of these, it is the oldest continually occupied agricultural high school site in NSW (since Hurlstone was moved to Glenfield in 1926). The older historic buildings of this educational complex display how ideas, trends, and methods in agricultural and isolated residential education have changed and evolved in NSW from the early twentieth century through to today. They also display the rare nature of YAHS and how it has provided a combination of academic and technical based training since the early twentieth century. This provides this site with research potential, rarity, and representative values in a state context. Finally, YAHS has social significance to the rural families of the south and west of NSW for the role it has played in educating several generations of rural children, especially those from isolated properties.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nYanco Agricultural High School was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 7 June 2019 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nYAHS is of state historical significance due to the important role it has played in the history and development of large-scale irrigation schemes and agricultural education in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nThe McCaughey Mansion, its remnant landscaped gardens (including the artificial lake), pump display, two remnant canal sections, carriage way (now the main entrance road), and agricultural landscape are strongly associated with the earliest large-scale private irrigation scheme in the state. Between 1899-1903 Sir Samuel McCaughey constructed over 320km of irrigation canals on the North Yanco Holding to illustrate to the people and government of NSW that extensive irrigation was beneficial and essential to the development of agriculture and pastoralism in the drought prone west of NSW. Its success led to the commencement of the long-proposed MIA scheme which extended the North Yanco system. Today the MIA is a diverse food production area that contributes $5 billion to the Australian economy annually. The surviving range of features at YAHS displays both the first stage of the irrigation system (two remnant canal sections) and the results of its success (the mansion and landscaped gardens) that allows this important story to be effectively told.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nYAHS is of state historical significance as a unique example of a surviving public residential agricultural high school from the establishment of secondary specialist schools in NSW during the early twentieth century. YAHS is prominent in the history and development of agricultural high school education in NSW, especially as it catered for the agricultural families of the rural focussed south and west portions of the state. Of the four agricultural high schools established in NSW (Hurlstone (1907), Farrer (1939), and James Ruse (1959)), YAHS is the second oldest (established 1922) and retains its history and heritage as it has remained at the same site throughout its history (unlike Hurlstone). Its long term connection and association with its site means that the school complex demonstrates the progression of buildings, methods, ideas, and technology associated with the development of agricultural education in NSW throughout the twentieth and twenty first centuries. Since its establishment, YAHS has steadily grown, and evolved with educational trends and ideas so that it can deliver a regionally based, boarder only, agricultural education experience for boys and girls that is historically singular and unique in the state context. The fact that YAHS is strongly associated with the history and development of the MIA, as it was originally designed to provide farmers for this scheme, only adds to its historical significance. The way the school is also founded around the McCaughey Mansion and utilises the remnant irrigation works and agricultural landscape of the North Yanco Irrigation Scheme accentuates and deepens it historical connection to irrigation and agricultural in the regional and state sphere.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nYAHS has a strong historical association of state significance with Sir Samuel McCaughey (1835-1919). Sir McCaughey was a successful, prominent, and influential pastoralist and sheep-breeder, innovator of farming technology and equipment, advocate of large-scale irrigation works, philanthropist, and member of the NSW Legislative Council (1899-1919). Without his championing of the benefits, potential, and feasibility of large-scale irrigation schemes and his own personal effort (financing and drive) in demonstrating their effectiveness at North Yanco it is unlikely that the MIA scheme would have been undertaken. His efforts have led him to be remembered in the local region as the \"Father of Irrigation\". Sir McCaughey's interest and life's work in pastoralism and irrigation is clearly perceptible at YAHS at the McCaughey Mansion (his home from 1902-1919), its associated gardens and artificial lake, the two remnant canals, and surrounding agricultural landscape. The McCaughey Mansion also contains two items of movable heritage strongly associated with Sir McCaughey: a life sized portrait by Frederick McCubbin (1901) and his dress sword.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe McCaughey Mansion is of state technical significance as a unique example of a Federation Arts and Crafts / Free Style mansion constructed in an isolated rural context. Designed by the Sydney architect Herbert E. Ross, this mansion has far more in common with the large mansions erected on the Upper [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]] of Sydney than rural homesteads of this period. As such, this mansion is quite rare in the central and western districts of NSW. For Sir McCaughey it was a clear statement of his wealth and influence that allowed him to transport this type of metropolitan focussed architecture and high craftmanship to an isolated rural context.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nYAHS is of state social significance for the esteem it is held in by many rural families and communities across south and west NSW. Throughout its long history it has provided a valued education to the children of these families and has played an important educational role in this region. Since 1922 it has been a central boarding school for boys seeking to continue their family farms or move into other areas of the agricultural industry. From 1993 the school has also played an identical role for girls from the same families or those seeking an agricultural education. As such, many families in this region have a long association with the school that transcends generations and has expanded in the last 25 years to include female members. The school has a strong connection with past students through its old students' club, the Old Yanconians' Union (probably formed by the 1930s), who hold annual events at the school and are actively engaged in school life.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe remnant two canal sections (one extant, one archaeological) at YAHS have research potential in a state context for the information they can provide on the first stage of the North Yanco Irrigation Scheme. This private large-scale irrigation scheme was developed by Sir Samuel McCaughey from 1899-1903 to demonstrate the benefits, potential, and feasibility of extensive irrigation works to the people and government of NSW. The irrigation works around the McCaughey Mansion were likely the first constructed in the scheme and likely provide an important archaeological window into the initial methods and ideas used by Sir McCaughey in his irrigation works. These archaeological features could be compared and contrasted with the other remnant channels and irrigation works from the subsequent phases of the scheme preserved across other sections of the former North Yanco Holding. This potentially includes channels and irrigation works incorporated into the MIA that are still functioning today. In this manner, the archaeological remnants of the canal system and irrigation works at YAHS are potentially important archaeological resources in the study of the development of large-scale irrigation systems (and the excavation and pumping technology involved) in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nThe buildings, equipment, and archives of the school complex at YAHS have research potential in a state context for the information they can provide on the history and development of agricultural education in NSW. The way buildings from different periods are preserved at YAHS provides a window through which the changing and evolving ideas and thoughts about agricultural education in NSW from the 1920s through to the present can be appreciated. This could be an important resource for any study of agricultural education in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nYAHS is rare in a state context as the commencement site of the first private large-scale irrigation scheme in NSW. This rarity of YAHS is demonstrated by the McCaughey Mansion, its remnant landscaped gardens (including the artificial lake), pump display, agricultural landscape, and two remnant canals. These elements of YAHS are part of the first stage of the North Yanco irrigation scheme (1899-1903). The North Yanco scheme is particularly rare because it was a private enterprise in comparison to the other earlier small government sponsored schemes: the [[Curlwaa, New South Wales|Curlwaa]] Irrigation Area (1888) and Hay Private Irrigation District (1892-1893).<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nYAHS is rare in a state context as one of only four agricultural high schools ever established in NSW (Hurlstone (1907), Farrier (1939), and James Ruse (1959)). This rarity of YAHS is demonstrated by the older educational buildings on site and the later occupation phases of the older North Yanco era buildings. YAHS is the second oldest agricultural high school in NSW (established 1922). With the pending closure of the Glenfield site of [[Hurlstone Agricultural High School]] (scheduled for 2020) YAHS will soon become the oldest, continually occupied, agricultural high school site in NSW. YAHS's close association with the MIA (and irrigation), rural families in the south and west of NSW, its good condition, wide range of educational agricultural buildings, and isolated rural location strengthens its significance against this criterion.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\nThe McCaughey Mansion is rare in a state context as an unusual example of a Federation Arts and Crafts / Free Style mansion in the central and western districts of NSW. Although modified, the Mansion retains many original features and its character. Its isolated rural context is rare and unusual in a state context as the majority of mansions of this architectural style are confined to the Sydney metropolitan area.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nYAHS is representative in a state context as an intact, well-preserved, and functional example of a rare type of specialist educational precinct in NSW. It contains a wide range of agricultural educational buildings and facilities from a variety of periods that display the progression and development of ideas about agricultural education in NSW from the 1920s to the present. As this site has been continually occupied from 1922 and YAHS is proud of its history and heritage it is an excellent representative example of an agricultural high school.<ref name=nswshr-2021/>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|Schools}}}}\n* [[List of government schools in New South Wales: Q-Z|List of government schools in New South Wales]]\n* [[List of selective high schools in New South Wales]]\n* [[List of boarding schools in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|editor1=Aitken, Ritchard |editor2=Looker, Michael |date=2002|title=The Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens}}  \n*  {{cite web |author=Barwick, W.

Johnson]] authorization, without a formal [[Declaration of war by the United States|declaration of war]] by Congress, for the use of [[Conventional warfare|conventional]] military force in [[Southeast Asia]]. Specifically, the resolution authorized the President to do whatever necessary in order to assist \"any member or protocol state of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty]]\". This included involving armed forces.\n\nIt was opposed in the Senate only by Senators [[Wayne Morse]] (D-OR) and [[Ernest Gruening]] (D-AK). Senator Gruening objected to \"sending our American boys into combat in a war in which we have no business, which is not our war, into which we have been misguidedly drawn, which is steadily being escalated\". {{Harv|Tonkin Gulf debate|1964}} The Johnson administration subsequently relied upon the resolution to begin its rapid escalation of U.S. military involvement in [[South Vietnam]] and open warfare between [[North Vietnam]] and the [[United States]].\n\n==Towards the Incident ==\nThroughout 1963, the Kennedy administration have become concerned that the South Vietnamese regime of Ngo Dinh Diem was losing the war to the Viet Cong. Such concerns were intensified after Diem was overthrown and killed on 2 November 1963. On 19 December 1963, the Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] visited Saigon and reported to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] that the situation was \"very disturbing\" as \"current trends, unless reversed in the next two or three months, will lead to neutralization at best or more likely to a Communist-controlled state\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} McNamara further reported the Viet Cong were winning the war as they controlled \"larger percentages of the population, greater amounts of territory and have destroyed or occupied more strategic hamlets than expected\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} About the Revolutionary Command Council as the South Vietnamese military junta called itself, McNamara was scathing, saying \"there is no organized government in South Vietnam\" as the junta was \"indecisive and drifting\" with the generals being \"so preoccupied with essentially political affairs\" that they had no time for the war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} \n\nIn response to McNamara's report, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended the United States intervene in the war, with the Air Force's commander, General [[Curtis LeMay]], calling for a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam, saying \"we are swatting flies when we should be going after the manure pile\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} Using less earthly language than LeMay, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] in a report to Johnson called South Vietnam \"pivotal\" to the United States's \"worldwide confrontation with Communism\" and predicated that to allow South Vietnam to fall to the Viet Cong would be such a blow to American \"durability, resolution and trustworthiness\" that all of Asia might very well be lost to Communism.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}}  Taylor also argued that to see South Vietnam fall to the Viet Cong would so damage \"our image\" in Africa and Latin America that both of those regions might also be lost to Communism as well.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} Given these stakes with Taylor claiming the entire Third World would be lost to Communism if South Vietnam went Communist, he argued for drastic measures, saying the United States should taking \"increasing bolder\" measures with the United States to start bombing North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}}The journalist [[Stanley Karnow]] wrote Taylor had offered up an \"inflated\" version of the \"domino theory\" with the entire Third World potentially lost to Communism if South Vietnam became the first \"domino\" to fall.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} \n\nThough Johnson was planning as president to focus on domestic affairs such as civil rights for Afro-Americans together with social legislation to improve the lot of the poor, he was very afraid that to \"lose\" South Vietnam would cause him to be branded as \"soft on Communism\", the dreaded accusation that could end the career of any American politician at the time.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} Rather than the ''primat der aussenpolitik'' reason of the \"domino theory\", Johnson was more motivated by the ''primat der innenpolitik'' reason of the fear that if South Vietnam was \"lost\", it would generate a right-wing backlash similar to the one generated by the \"[[loss of China]]\" in 1949, which allowed Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] to achieve national prominence.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=330}} The fear that a new McCarthy-type Republican politician would emerge and derail his domestic reforms was Johnson's primary reason for refusing to accept the possibility of South Vietnam being \"lost\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=330}} Johnson's determination to not \"lose\" South Vietnam extended to rejecting a peace plan put forward by the French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] who favored having South Vietnam becoming neutral in the Cold War in order to provide with Americans with an honorable way to disengage from Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=337}} Through not keen on fighting a war in Vietnam, Johnson told Taylor and other the chiefs of staff at a Christmas Eve party in 1963: \"Just let me get elected, and then you can have your war\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} The instability of South Vietnamese politics suggested it was impossible for the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam-i.e. the South Vietnamese Army) to focus on the war. Johnson stated at a meeting in the Oval Office that he was fed up with \"this coup shit\", and shortly there afterwards another coup took place in Saigon as General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]] overthrew General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] on 30 January 1964.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=334-335}} \n\nThrough the United States had long denounced the government of North Vietnam for trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam, accusing Hanoi of \"aggression\", the government of South Vietnam had with American support also been trying to overthrow the government of North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} Ever since the Geneva Accords had partitioned Vietnam in 1954, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been training squads of South Vietnamese volunteers and infiltrating them into North Vietnam with the aim of starting an anti-Communist guerrilla war with a spectacular lack of success.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} For an example, of the 80 teams that were infiltrated into North Vietnam in 1963, all of were captured, causing one CIA agent to later say: \"I didn't mind butchering the enemy, but we were butchering our own allies\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} In January 1964, Johnson gave his approval for a plan to step up the pace and intensity of the covert war against North Vietnam, which was code-named [[Operation 34A]].{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} Johnson had hopes that Operation 34A might at best lead to the overthrow of North Vietnam's Communist government and at worse might so weaken North Vietnam as to end the war in South Vietnam. As part of Operation 34A, starting on 1 February 1964, South Vietnamese commandos began to conduct maritime raids on coastal North Vietnam under American naval operational command.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363-364}}\n\nThe new Kh\u00e1nh government proved to just as ineffective as the previous Minh government had been in fighting the war. In February 1964, [[Lyman Kirkpatrick]], the CIA's Inspector General, visited South Vietnam and reported that he was \"shocked by the number of our people and of the military, even those whose job is always to say that we are winning, who feel the tide is against us\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=340}} The general consensus amongst American Vietnam experts by early 1964 was as one official wrote \"unless there is a marked improvement in the effectiveness of the South Vietnamese government and armed forces\" that South Vietnam had only \"an even chance of withstanding the insurgency menace during the next few weeks or months\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=340-341}} Through in public, the Johnson administration still ruled out American intervention, but in private, Johnson was inclined to listen to the advice of McNamara and Taylor who advised him that only American military intervention could save South Vietnam now as the feuding generals of the Revolutionary Command Council was simply too disunited, too corrupt and too incompetent to win the war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=341}}  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nIn February 1964, [[Walt Whitman Rostow]], the director of the State Department's [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] pointed out a major constitutional problem with the plans to commit American forces to Vietnam, noting under the American constitution only Congress had the power to declare war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=357-358}} Johnson had made it that he was opposed to Kh\u00e1nh's plans to have South Vietnam invade North Vietnam out of the fear of causing a war with China, and he had even less enthusiasm for the United States invading North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=343}} To have the U.S. declare war on North Vietnam would lead to immense domestic pressure to invade North Vietnam. Johnson remembered how in 1950 the approach of U.S. forces upon the Yalu led to Chinese intervention in the Korean War, and was fearful that invading North Vietnam would again led to Chinese intervention. Moreover, unlike in 1950, by 1964 China had nuclear weapons.  To resolve this problem, Rostow suggested to Johnson that Congress pass a resolution authorizing Johnson to use force in Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=358}} \n\nRostow was supported by [[William Bundy]], the assistant secretary for Asia, who advised Johnson in a memo on 1 March 1964 that the U.S Navy should blockade Haiphong and start bombing North Vietnam's railroads, factories, road and training camps.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=344}} Bundy stated that the plans for stepped-up U.S involvement would \"normally require\" a declaration of war from Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=360}} Bundy advised against the \"blunt instrument\" of a declaration of war as at present Johnson still only had only \"selective goals\" in Vietnam, but stated that it would be \"unsatisfactory\" to have Congress not endorse the planned increased involvement in Vietnam for constitutional reasons.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=360}}\u00a0Bundy argued that the \"best answer\" to this problem was an event from Johnson's own career as a Senator when in January 1955 when he voted for the [[Formosa Resolution of 1955|Formosa Resolution]]  giving President Eisenhower the power to use military force \"as he deems necessary\" to protect Taiwan from a Chinese invasion.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=360}} At the time, the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis|Taiwan Strait Crisis]] was raging with the Chinese Communists bombarding several islands in the Taiwan strait still held by the Kuomintang regime in Taiwan, and many believed the congressional resolution giving Eisenhower the legal power to go to war in defense of Taiwan had ended the crisis. \n\nUnlike the 1955 resolution, which Johnson had supported as Senate Majority Leader and used all of his influence to get the other Senators to vote for, the current Senate Majority Leader, [[Mike Mansfield]], was known to be skeptical about using American forces to support South Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} Mansfield, a devout Catholic who was only willing to support wars that met the Catholic definition of a \"just war\" had once been one of South Vietnam's warmest supporters on Capital Hill, but after visiting South Vietnam in late 1962 came back very disillusioned by what he had seen, stating the regime was just as tyrannical as the Viet Cong guerrillas fighting to overthrow it.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=217-219 & 268}} Besides for Mansfield, Bundy predicated problems from Senator [[Wayne Morse]], a stubborn and cantankerous character who was known for his strongly held view that only Congress had power to declare war, and who deeply disliked resolutions like the Formosa resolution as weakening the power of Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} Bundy warned the president that his \"doubtful friends\" in Congress might delay the passage of the desired resolution which would give America's European allies opposed to a war in Southeast Asia the chance to impose \"tremendous pressure\" on the U.S. to \"to stop and negotiate\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} \n\nMcNamara visited South Vietnam for four days starting on 8 March 1964, and upon his return to Washington was even more pessimistic than he been before in December 1963.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=341-342}} McNamara reported to Johnson the situation had \"unquestionably been growing worse\" since his last visit in December as 40% of the countryside was now under Vietcong \"control or predominant influence\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} McNamara further reported that desertion rate in the ARVN was \"high and increasing\"; the Vietcong were \"recruiting energetically\"; the South Vietnamese people were overcome by \"apathy and indifference\"; and the \"greatest weakness\" was the \"uncertain viability\" of Kh\u00e1nh regime which might be overthrown by another coup at any moment.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} In response to McNamara's report, the National Security Council issued an \"action memorandum\" calling for increased military aid to South Vietnam and asserted that Vietnam was a \"test case\" of American global leadership, claiming that a Communist victory in South Vietnam would so damage American prestige that none of America's allies would believe in American promises if South Vietnam was \"lost\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} By presenting the Vietnam war in these stark terms with the melodramatic claim that the United States would cease to be a world power if South Vietnam was \"lost\", the \"action memorandum\" virtually guaranteed American intervention..{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAt the time, Morse was one of the few critics of Johnson's Vietnam policy. In a speech in April 1964, Morse called the war \"McNamara's War\", claiming: \"Not one voice has yet answered my contention that the United States, under the leadership of Defense Secretary McNamara, is fighting an illegal and unwise war in Vietnam.\"{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=22}} As Morse remained outspoken in his criticism of Johnson's Vietnam policy, accusing him of violating international law. on 13 May 1964, Bundy called a meeting to discuss how best to deal with Morse.{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=22}} [[Jonathan Moore (State Department official)|Jonathan Moore]], an aide to Bundy advised him that Morse was correct that the administration was \"on pretty thin ice\" when it came to advocating escalation on the basis of international law.{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=22}} As it was felt that Morse was strong on the legalistic arguments, Moore recommended that the administration \"shift gears rapidly into a general (practical and political) rationale\" and ignore Morse as much as possible.{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=23}} Bundy believed the resolution as he was writing it would give Johnson \"the full support of the school of thought headed by Senator Mansfield and Senator Aiken and leave ourselves with die-hard opposition only from Senator Morse and his very few cohorts.\"{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=23}} \n\nBy late May 1964, a rough draft of the resolution that was to become the Gulf of Tonkin resolution had been completed by Bundy which if passed by Congress would give Johnson the legal power to use force to defend any nation in Southeast Asia threatened by \"Communist aggression or subversion\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}}  By the beginning of June 1964, the final draft of the resolution had been completed and all that remained to do was to submit it to Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}} The acting Attorney General, [[Nicholas Katzenbach]], called resolution the \"functional equivalent of a declaration of war\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}} The U.S Air Force had already selected 94 sites in North Vietnam to be bombed while the U.S. Navy had moved a carrier task force into the Gulf of Tonkin with the orders to be prepared for \"reprisal bombings\" of North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}} Initially, the plans called for the United States to respond to guerrilla attacks in South Vietnam with bombing raids over North Vietnam, and then Johnson would submit the resolution to Congress sometime in late June 1964.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361-362}} At the time, Congress was preoccupied with the Civil Rights Act, which was intended to outlaw segregation, a bill that Johnson had supported and was met with fierce resistance from Southern senators and congressmen who did everything within their power to \"kill the bill\". Johnson wanted the Civil Rights Act passed before submitting the resolution to Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} On 15 June 1964, however Johnson's National Security Adviser [[McGeorge Bundy]], told the National Security Council that the president did not feel that Viet Cong attacks on the South Vietnamese government were a sufficient ''casus belli'' as Johnson wanted a North Vietnamese attack on American forces as his ''casus belli'', arguing that Congress would be more likely to pass the resolution if was in response to the latter rather than the former.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}}\u00a0On 18 June 1964, the Canadian diplomat [[J. Blair Seaborn]] arrived in Hanoi carrying the message from Johnson that North Vietnam would suffer the \"greatest devastation\" from American bombing if it continued on its present course. {{sfn|Hunt|1993|p=15}} In June 1964, the American ambassador in Saigon, Henry Cabot Lodge, resigned in order to seek the Republican nomination for president. Johnson appointed Taylor as the new ambassador with orders to make the South Vietnamese fight.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=345}} Taylor's successor as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was General [[Earle Wheeler|Earle \"Bus\" Wheeler]]. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n==The Gulf of Tonkin Incident==\n{{main|Gulf of Tonkin incident}}\nSoviet-North Vietnamese relations had badly strained in the early 1960s as North Vietnam moved closer to China, the more militant and aggressive of the two warring Communist giants.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=328}} When [[Mao Zedong]] denounced [[Nikita Khrushchev]] for his \"cowardice\" for choosing a diplomatic compromise to settle the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 instead of a nuclear war against the United States as Mao preferred, North Vietnamese newspapers approvingly cited his remarks.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=328}} Likewise, when Khrushchev signed the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963, Mao again mocked him for his moderation, and was again approvingly quoted by North Vietnamese newspapers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=328}} In a bid to recapture influence lost to China, the Soviet Union sold North Vietnam a radar system that was far more advanced than anything China could produce together with batteries of SAMs (surface-to-air missiles).{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} All through the spring and summer of 1964, Soviet workers were building and installing radar stations together with SAM batteries all over North Vietnam while training the North Vietnamese in their use.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} As the U.S. Air Force and Navy were developing their plans at the same time to bomb North Vietnam, both the admirals and Air Force generals insisted that they needed more information about the radar network the Soviets were installing, most notably the frequencies the radar used in order to develop jamming mechanisms.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} As a result, the U.S. Navy began to increase [[DESOTO patrol|DESOTO patrols]] off the coast of North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} The Navy's tactic was to have South Vietnamese commandos land to attack the North Vietnamese radar stations, forcing the operators to turn on the radars, which thereby allowed the Americans to learn what frequencies they used.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} The South Vietnamese commandos were landed in light, Norwegian-built patrol boats made of aluminium and armed with machine guns and cannons known as the Swift boats.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} \n\nBy July 1964, the rugged coastline of North Vietnam with its islands, bays, and estuaries was a war zone with South Vietnamese commandos constantly landing to raid while the North Vietnamese made vigorous efforts to stop the raids.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365-366}} In support of the raids, an American destroyer, the USS ''Maddox'' was deployed to the Gulf of Tonkin with orders to collect electronic intelligence on the North Vietnamese radar system.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} Admiral [[U. S. Grant Sharp Jr.]], the commander of the Pacific fleet ordered Captain [[John J. Herrick]] of the ''Maddox'' not to go any closer that 8 miles from the coast of North Vietnam and no more than 4 miles from any of the archipelagos off the coast.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} The French had claimed control of only 3 miles of the waters off the coastline of Indochina, a claim that North Vietnam had inherited.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} Subsequently, the North Vietnamese had extended their claim to control of waters 12 miles off their coastline, a claim the United States had declined to recognize.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} On 30 July 1964, South Vietnamese commandos tried to attack the North Vietnamese radar station on the island of Hon Me, but were detected as they were coming in, leading the North Vietnamese to open fire, making any landing impossible.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=367}} The radar on Hon Me was turned on, and the ''Maddox'' stationed off the coast picked up the radar frequency being used.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=367}} North Vietnam made a formal protest about the raid to the International Control Commission consisting of delegations of diplomats from India, Canada and Poland that were supposed to enforce the Geneva Accords, accusing the United States of being behind the raid.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=367}}\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n[[File:President Lyndon B.

Breaking contact, the combatants commenced going their separate ways, when the three torpedo boats, '''T-333''', '''T-336''', and '''T-339''' were then attacked by four USN [[Vought F-8 Crusader|F-8 Crusader]] jet fighter bombers from the aircraft carrier {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}.{{sfn|Moise|1996|p=82}} The Crusaders reported no hits with their [[Zuni (rocket)|Zuni]] rockets, but scored hits on all three torpedo boats with their [[Colt Mk 12 cannon|20-mm cannons]], damaging all three boats. \n\nJohnson was informed of the incident and in the first use of the \"hotline\" to Moscow installed after the Cuban Missile Crisis called Khrushchev in the Kremlin to say that the United States did not want war, but he hoped that the Soviets would use their influence to persuade North Vietnam to not attack American warships.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=368-369}} Through Johnson had now an \"incident\" at sea involving a North Vietnamese attack against American warships, he declined to use it as a reason to present a resolution to Congress. Johnson's fear was that the North Vietnamese could claim that the attempted raid on the radar station on Hon Me on 30 July gave them legitimate fears that the ''Maddox'' might have been moving in for a new attack.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} Johnson wanted an \"incident\" where it was unambiguous that the North Vietnamese were the aggressors by attacking American warships in waters that the American regarded as international. \n\nOut of the hope of provoking such an incident, Johnson ordered the ''Maddox'' to continue to cruise off the coast of North Vietnam, to be joined by another destroyer, USS ''Turner Joy'' with orders \"to attack any force that attacks them\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} Both destroyers were ordered to sail 8 miles from North Vietnam in waters that Americans asserted were international waters, disregarding North Vietnam's claim to the 12-mile limit.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} The Secretary of State, [[Dean Rusk]], ordered his staff to \"pull together\" the resolution Bundy had written in May-June, just in case Johnson decided to submit it to Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} On 3 August 1963, the South Vietnamese in their Swift boats raided Cape Vinhson and Cua Ron.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} The cruise of the American destroyers was not directly connected to the raid, but Herrick knew from reading the summaries of decrypted North Vietnamese radio messages that the North Vietnamese believed that it was.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} Herrick received orders to \"show the gauntlet\" and prove to the North Vietnamese that the Americans would sail off North Vietnam in waters that the Americans insisted were international waters.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}}\u00a0\n\nTwo days later on a very stormy night on August 4, ''Maddox'' and the destroyer [[USS Turner Joy (DD-951)|''Turner Joy'']] both reported to be under attack again, by North Vietnamese torpedo boats; during this alleged engagement, ''Turner Joy'' fired approximately 220 3-inch & 5-inch shells at surface targets showing on the radar.{{sfn|Moise|1996|p=158}}{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} In response to the reported attack, aircraft from the ''Ticonderoga''  were launched, but the pilots reported no visual contact with any craft other than the two destroyers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} [[Hanoi]] subsequently insisted that it had not launched a second attack. Through Herrick had reported an attack by North Vietnamese torpedo boats, he soon developed strong doubts about whatever an attack had actually occurred.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Herrick reported to Admiral Sharp that the \"torpedo boats\" were almost certainly radar blips due to the \"freak weather effects\" caused by the storm and that an \"overeager\" sonar operator aboard the ''Maddox'' had mistaken the effects of the storm for torpedoes.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Herrick's report concluded with the statement the \"entire action leaves many doubts\" as he noted that no sailor abroad his ship had seen a torpedo boat nor had heard any gunfire beyond the guns of the ''Turner Joy''.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Likewise no sailor abroad the ''Turner Joy'' claimed to have seen any North Vietnamese craft and none of the pilots of the Crusader aircraft stated that they had seen any torpedo boats.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}}\n\nA later investigation by the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] revealed that ''Maddox'' had been on an [[reconnaissance|electronic intelligence]] ([[DESOTO patrol|DESOTO]]) mission. It also learned that the U.S. Naval Communication Center in the Philippine Islands, in reviewing the ships' messages, had questioned whether any second attack had actually occurred.{{sfn|NYT|1968}} In 2005, an internal National Security Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded that ''Maddox'' had engaged the North Vietnamese Navy on August 2, but that there may not have been any North Vietnamese Naval vessels present during the engagement of August 4. The report stated:\n\n{{quote|It is not simply that there is a different story as to what happened; it is that no attack happened that night. ... In truth, Hanoi's navy was engaged in nothing that night but the salvage of two of the boats damaged on August 2.{{sfn|Hanyok|2000|p=3}} }}\n\nIn 1965, President Johnson commented privately: \"For all I know, our Navy was shooting at whales out there.\"{{sfn|KQED|2006}}\n\n==Congress votes==\nEarly on the morning of 4 August 1964, Johnson told several congressmen at a meeting that North Vietnam had just attacked an American patrol in the Gulf of Tonkin in international waters and promised retaliation.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} At the same time, Johnson also stated that he wanted Congress to vote for a resolution of support.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} After the meeting, Johnson told one of his aides, [[Kenneth O'Donnell|Kenny O'Donnell]], that he felt he was \"being tested\" by North Vietnam with both agreeing that how the president handled the crisis would affect the election.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} O'Donnell recalled that Johnson's main fear was the incident might allow his Republican opponent in the election, Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], a chance to gain in the polls.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} O'Donnell added that Johnson felt that he \"must not allow them [the Republicans] to accuse him of vacillating or being an indecisive leader\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} \n\nThe equivocal nature of Captain Herrick's reports were a worrisome factor, and Johnson informed McNamara, the member of the cabinet that he trusted the most, to ensure that the naval report remove all of the ambiguous elements.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} In turn, McNamara phoned Admiral Sharp to say the president was keen to launch a retaliatory raid, but could not move \"unless we are dammed sure what happened\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Admiral Sharp in turn applied strong pressure on Herrick to rewrite his report to \"confirm absolutely\" that his patrol had been just attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}}\u00a0At the same time that Sharp was pressuring Herrick, Johnson had summoned McNamara to the White House to point out to him the best places to bomb in North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}} The British ambassador, [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|Lord Harlech]], and the West German ambassador, [[Karl Heinrich Knappstein]], were summoned to the State Department to be told that the United States would be launching a major bombing raid on North Vietnam very soon.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}}\u00a0A press release from the Defense Department accused North Vietnam of a \"second deliberate attack\" on American warships in international waters.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}} Johnson invited 18 Senators and congressmen led by Mansfield to the White House to inform them he had ordered a bombing raid on North Vietnam and asked for their support for a resolution.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=302-303}} Most were supportive, through Mansfield still had doubts, saying he preferred the matter be referred to the United Nations.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=303}} Rusk assured Mansfield that he would liked to take the matter up at the UN, but the possibility of a Soviet veto at the UN left the president no choice.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=303}} After the meeting, Johnson summoned his National Security Adviser, [[McGeorge Bundy|McGeorge \"Mac\" Bundy]], to tell him: \"You know that resolution your brother's been talking about for the past few months? Well, now's the time to get it through Congress\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=305}} When Bundy replied \"Mr. President, that seems too fast for me\", Johnson growled \"I didn't ask you that question. I want you to do it\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=305}}\u00a0 \n\nWithin hours, President Johnson ordered the launching of retaliatory air strikes ([[Operation Pierce Arrow]]) on the bases of the North Vietnamese torpedo boats and announced, in a television address to the American public that same evening, that U.S. naval forces had been attacked. Johnson in his television address announced: \"Repeated acts of violence against the armed forces of the United States must be met not only with alert defense, but with positive reply. That reply is being given as I speak tonight\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}} Johnson requested approval of a resolution \"expressing the unity and determination of the United States in supporting freedom and in protecting peace in southeast Asia\", stating that the resolution should express support \"for all necessary action to protect our Armed Forces\", but repeated previous assurances that \"the United States ... seeks no wider war\". As the nation entered the final three months of political campaigning for the 1964 elections (in which Johnson was standing for election), the president contended that the resolution would help \"hostile nations ... understand\" that the United States was unified in its determination \"to continue to protect its national interests\".{{sfn|President's Message to Congress|1964}} \n\nThe [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) had broken North Vietnam's codes, and McNamara put much emphasis to Johnson on certain decrypts speaking of North Vietnamese torpedo boats having been damaged by American destroyers as proving the second incident happened.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=373}} However, several intelligence analysis at the time accused McNamara of having either have misinterpreted, either intentionally or by mistake, decrypts referring to the first incident of 2 August and presenting them as referring to the second alleged incident of 4 August.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=373-374}} [[Ray S. Cline]], the deputy director of the CIA later stated: \"I felt from the start that the second incident had been questionable, but I simply wasn't sure. However, after a number of days collating and examining the reports relating to the second incident, I concluded that they were either unsound or that they dealt with the first incident\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Cline was told to keep his doubts to himself.\n\nOn 5 August 1964, Johnson submitted the resolution to Congress, which if passed would give him the legal power to \"take all necessary measures\" and \"prevent further aggression\" as well as allowing him to decide when \"peace and security\" in Southeast Asia were attained.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Johnson commented the resolution was \"like grandma's nightshirt-it covered everything\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Despite his public claims of \"aggression\", Johnson in private believed that the second incident had not taken place, saying at a meeting in the Oval Office in his Texas twang: \"Hell, those dumb stupid sailors were just shooting at flying fish\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} The president's two chosen instruments for passing the resolution were the Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] and Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} McNamara had the image of the \"whiz kid\", a man of almost superhuman intelligence and ability whose computer-generated graphs and spreadsheets showed the best way to \"scientifically\" solve any problem.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} McNamara, whose statements always seemed to be backed up by the Pentagon's computers had the ability to \"dazzle\" Congress and whatever he requested of Congress tended to be approved.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Fulbright, through too much an individualist and an intellectual to fit into the Senate's \"Club\", was widely respected as the Senate's resident foreign policy expert and as a defender of Congress's prerogatives.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} If Fulbright backed the resolution, Johnson knew that he would probably carry over the doubters and waverers, of which there were several.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Johnson knew that the conservative Republicans together with the conservative Southern Democrats would vote for the resolution, but he did not want to be dependent upon their support for his foreign policy as his domestic policies were anathema to them.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}}\u00a0From Johnson's viewpoint, having liberal Democrats and liberal Republicans vote for the resolution would free his hands to carry out the domestic reforms he wanted to have Congress pass after the election.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} \u00a0\n\nOn 5 August 1964, Fulbright arrived at the White House to meet Johnson, where the president asked his old friend to use all his influence to get the resolution passed.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}}  Johnson insisted quite vehemently to Fulbright that the alleged attack on the destroyers had taken place and it was only later that Fulbright became skeptical about whatever the alleged attack had really taken place.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Furthermore, Johnson insisted the resolution, which was a \"functional equivalent to a declaration of war\" was not intended to be used for going to war in Vietnam.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} In the 1964 election, the Republicans had nominated Goldwater as their candidate, who ran on a platform accusing Johnson of being \"soft on Communism\" and by contrast promised a \"total victory\" over Communism.\u00a0Johnson argued to Fulbright that the resolution was an election year stunt that would prove to the voters that he was really \"tough on Communism\" and thus dent the appeal of Goldwater by denying him of his main avenue of attack.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Besides for the ''primat der innenpolitik'' reason Johnson gave for the resolution, he also gave a ''primat der aussenpolitik'' reason, arguing that such a resolution would intimidate North Vietnam into ceasing to try to overthrow the government of South Vietnam, and as such Congress passing a resolution would make American involvement in Vietnam less likely rather than more likely.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Fulbright's longstanding friendship with Johnson made it difficult for him to go against the president, who cunningly exploited Fulbright's vulnerability, namely his desire to have greater influence over foreign policy.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Johnson gave Fulbright the impression that he would be one of his unofficial advisers on foreign policy and that he was very interested in turning his ideas into policies, provided that he voted for the resolution, which was a test of their friendship.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}}  Johnson also hinted that he was thinking about sacking Rusk if he won the 1964 election and would consider nominating Fulbright to be the next Secretary of State.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Fulbright had much contempt for whoever happened to be Secretary of State, always believing that he understood foreign policy better than any of them, and had a particular contempt for Rusk, so the offer to be Secretary of State was tempting for him.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=306}} Fulbright also felt a strong rapport with his fellow Southerner Johnson, the first Southern president since Wilson.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=306}} \u00a0Finally, for Fulbright in 1964 it was inconceivable that Johnson would lie to him and he believed the resolution \"was not going to be used for anything other than the Tonkin Gulf incident itself\" as Johnson had told him.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Johnson told Fulbright he wanted the resolution passed by the widest possible margin to show North Vietnam that Congress was united behind the administration.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Despite all of Johnson's efforts, there was little danger of the resolution not being passed. A public opinion poll at the time showed that 85% of Americans felt that Congress should pass the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nOn August 6, [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara|Robert S. McNamara]] testified before a joint session of the Senate [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services]] committees. He stated that ''Maddox'' had been \"carrying out a routine mission of the type we carry out all over the world at all times\" and denied that it had been in any way involved in South Vietnamese patrol boat raids on the offshore islands of Hon Me and Hon Nieu on the nights of July 30 and July 31.{{sfn|NYT|1968}} In his testimony, McNamara accused North Vietnam of \"aggression\" and of an \"unprovoked attack\" on the destroyers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} Senator [[Wayne Morse]] had been tipped off by a source inside the Pentagon about Operation 34A, and asked McNamara about there was any connection between the activities of the ''Maddox'' and Operation 34A, leading to a blunt denial.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} In response to Morse's question, McNamara answered dismissively: \"Our navy played absolutely no part in, was not associated with, was not aware of any South Vietnamese actions, if there were any...I say this flatly. This is a fact\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} The administration did not, however, disclose that the island raids, although separate from the mission of ''Maddox'', had been part of a program of clandestine attacks on North Vietnamese installations called [[Operation 34A|Operation Plan 34A]]. These operations were carried out by U.S.-trained South Vietnamese [[commando]]s under the control of a [[United States Special Operations Forces|special operations unit]] of the U.S. [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] called the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group|Studies and Operations Group]].{{sfn|Andrad\u00e9|Conboy|1999}}\n\nDespite McNamara's statement, Morse appeared before an almost empty Senate later on 6 August 1964 to say: \"The place to settle the controversy is not on the battlefield but around the conference table\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} Morse was supported only by Senator [[Ernest Gruening]] who stated in a speech \"all Vietnam is not worth the life of a single American boy\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} Senator [[Richard Russell Jr.]], who previously had doubts about Vietnam and whose friendship with Johnson had just been destroyed by the latter's support for the Civil Rights Act, supported the resolution, saying: \"Our national honor is at stake. We cannot and will not shrink from defending it\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} On 6 August 1964, Fulbright gave a speech on the Senate floor calling for the resolution to be passed as he accused North Vietnam of \"aggression\" and praised Johnson for his \"great restraint...in response to the provocation of a small power\".{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} He also declared his support for the Johnson administration's \"noble\" Vietnam policy, which he called a policy of seeking \"...to establish viable, independent states in Indochina and elsewhere which will be free and secure from the combination of Communist China and Communist North Vietnam\".{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} Fulbright concluded that this policy could be accomplished via diplomatic means and echoing Johnson's thesis, argued that it was necessary to pass the resolution as a way to intimidate North Vietnam who would presumably change their policies towards South Vietnam once Congress passed the resolution.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} Fulbright called the resolution a mechanism \"calculated to prevent the spread of war\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} \n\nAt a crucial meeting of several Senators, Fulbright was able to persuade them to support the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Several Senators such as [[Allen J. Ellender]], [[Jacob Javits]], [[John Sherman Cooper]], [[Daniel Brewster]], [[George McGovern]] and [[Gaylord Nelson]] were very reluctant to vote for a resolution that would be a \"blank cheque\" for a war in southeast Asia, and at the meeting Fulbright called to discuss the issue, he argued that passing a resolution would make fighting a war less likely, claiming the whole purpose of the resolution was only intimidation.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} Nelson wanted to add an amendment forbidding Johnson from sending troops to fight in Vietnam unless Congress gave its approval first, saying he did not like the open-ended nature of the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}}{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=27}} Fulbright dissuaded him, saying he had the president's word that \"the last thing we want to do is become involved in a land war in Asia\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Fulbright argued to Nelson the resolution was \"harmless\" while saying that the real purpose of the resolution was \"to pull the rug out from under Goldwater\", going on to ask Nelson who did he prefer to win the election, Johnson or Goldwater?{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=27}} From the viewpoint of Nelson, a liberal Democrat known for his support of environmentalism, Johnson was a far more preferable president than Goldwater, the leader of the right-wing of the Republican Party. \n\nAfter fewer than nine hours of committee consideration and floor debate, Congress voted, on August 10, 1964, on a joint [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] authorizing the president \"to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty]] requesting assistance in defense of its freedom\". {{Harv|H.J. RES 1145|1964}} The unanimous affirmative vote in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was 416\u20130. (However, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Eugene Siler]] of [[Kentucky]], who was not present but opposed the measure, was [[Pair (parliamentary convention)|\"paired\"]] with another member who favored the resolution\u2014i.e., his opposition was not counted, but the vote in favor was one less than it would have been.) The [[United States Senate|Senate]] conferred its approval by a vote of 88\u20132. Some members expressed misgivings about the measure, but in the end, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senators [[Wayne Morse]] of [[Oregon]] and [[Ernest Gruening]] of [[Alaska]] cast the only nay votes.{{sfn|Kenworthy|1964}} At the time, Senator Morse warned that \"I believe this resolution to be a historic mistake.\"{{sfn|Tonkin Gulf debate|1964}} Morse also predicated that those who voted for the resolution \"will live to regret it\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Much to Johnson's satisfaction, Senator Goldwater voted for the resolution as appropriate, which allowed the president to present himself as just \"tough on Communism\" as his opponent.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=306}}\u00a0  \u00a0\n\nAfter the resolution was passed, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, [[John W. McCormack]] called Johnson to congratulate him.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=307}} The call was recorded and Johnson spent much time denouncing Morse as mentally unstable and untrustworthy while he called Gruening an ingrate, saying \"He's just no good. I've spent millions on him up in Alaska\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=307}} Rostow was ebullient and stated: \"The second attack probably hadn't happened, but it was the chance to do what we should have been doing all along\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=307}}\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\n==As a policy instrument==\nThe passage of the resolution alarmed several American allies who preferred that the United States not fight in Vietnam such as Canada. [[J. Blair Seaborn]], the Canadian diplomat who served as Canada's representative to the [[International Control Commission]] engaged in secret \"shuttle diplomacy\" carrying messages back and forth from Hanoi to Washington in an attempt to stop the escalation of the war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} On 13 August 1964, Seaborn arrived in Hanoi to meet the North Vietnamese Premier, [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]].{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Seaborn told \u0110\u1ed3ng that based on his recent meetings with Johnson that he was seriously using the powers he just gained from the Gulf of Tonkin resolution to go to war, but also stated that Johnson was willing to offer \"economic and other benefits\" if only North Vietnam ceased trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Seaborn further stated that Johnson had told him that North Vietnam would \"suffer the consequences\" if it continued on its \"present course\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=377}} \u0110\u1ed3ng rejected the offer, saying he would rather see the war engulf \"the whole of Southeast Asia\" than to abandon the vision of one Communist Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=377}}\n\nThrough Johnson now had the power to wage war in Vietnam, he proved reluctant  to use it, instead hoping that Ambassador Taylor could somehow pressure the South Vietnamese to fight better.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=377-378}}  On 11 August 1964, William Bundy wrote a memo on the \"next course of action\", under which predicated that unless South Vietnamese \"morale and momentum\" could be improved, the regime of General Khanh would collapse.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=396-397}} Bundy recommended a programme of gradually increasing escalation to achieve \"maximum results for minimal risks\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=396-397}} Bundy argued for August, the United States should do nothing to \"take onus off the Communist side for escalation\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} Starting in September, the memo advocated more DESOTO patrols, 34A raids, and for the United States to start bombing the part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail running through neutral Laos.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} In January 1965, Bundy stated the \"next move upward\" would begin with a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} Taylor objected to Bundy's plan, stating if the U.S started bombing North Vietnam, it would trigger a North Vietnamese response that the South Vietnamese would not be able to handle on their own.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} Taylor, who had become increasingly disillusioned with South Vietnam as Khanh drove him to exasperation with his stupidity wrote: \"We should not get involved militarily with North Vietnam and possibly with Red China if our base in South Vietnam is insecure and Khanh's army is tied down everywhere by the Vietcong insurgency\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} General Wheeler and the rest of Joint Chiefs of Staff rejected Taylor's advice and advocated an immediate strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397-398}} On 7 September 1964, Johnson called a meeting at the White House attended by McNamara, Rusk, Wheeler, the Bundy brothers and Taylor to discuss what to do.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=398}} Taylor conceded that there \"only the emergence of an exceptional leader could improve the situation and there is no George Washington in sight\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=399}} The meeting concluded that the U.S. would react \"as appropriate\" against \"any\" attacks against American forces.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=399}} A war game conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September 1963 code-named Sigma I found that the U.S. would have to commit half-million troops to have a chance of victory in Vietnam; its sequel code-named Sigma II in September 1964 reached the same conclusion and found that despite the claims of General LeMay that a strategical bombing campaign would not be decisive, instead stating that the war would only be won on the ground.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=399}} \u00a0\n\nOn 1 November 1964, Viet Cong guerrillas attacked the American air field at the [[Bien Hoa Air Base]], killing 5 American servicemen and destroying 6 B-57 bombers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=402}} Wheeler recommended an immediate bombing campaign against North Vietnam, but Johnson demurred, instead creating a \"working group\" to consider scenarios for American intervention.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=402-403}} The conclusion of the \"working group\" chaired by William Bundy when presented in late November resorted to the bureaucratic device of the \"Goldilocks's Principle\" by presenting Johnson with two extreme options of either invading North Vietnam or abandoning South Vietnam; in between the two extremes was the third option of gradual escalation, which Bundy knew that Johnson would chose.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=404}} On 1 December 1964, McNamara, Rusk and \"Mac\" Bundy presented Johnson again with the \"Goldilock's Principle\" by giving him three options, knowing he would chose the third as invading North Vietnam and abandoning South Vietnam were too extreme for him.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=406}} Johnson agreed to their advice to launch [[Operation Barrel Roll]] to bomb the Lao section of the Ho Chi Minh trail and for more 34A raids.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=406}} On Christmas Eve 1964, the Viet Cong bombed the Brinks Hotel in Saigon, killing two Americans.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=408}} Despite almost unanimous advice to bomb North Vietnam, Johnson refused, saying in a cable to Taylor \"The final responsibility is mine and the stakes are very high indeed\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=409}} Johnson added: \"I have never felt that this war will be won from the air, and it seems to me that what is much needed and would be more effective is a larger and stronger use of Rangers and Special Forces and Marines, or other appropriate military strength on the ground and on scene..I know that it might involve the acceptance of larger Americans sacrifices but I myself am ready to substantially increase the Americans in Vietnam if it is necessary to provide this kind of fighting force against the Vietcong\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=409}}\n\nAs Johnson continued to procrastinate, he repeatedly received advice from McNamara, the Bundy brothers, Rusk, Wheeler and Taylor that now was the time to use his powers under the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=409-411}} A memo co-written by \"Mac\" Bundy and McNamara in January 1965 stated \"our present policy can lead only to a disastrous defeat\" with the alternative being either \"salvage what little can be saved\" by withdrawing or to commit American forces to war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=411}} By contrast, Taylor advised Johnson against committing American troops, stating that having the Americans \"carry the ball\" would only encourage South Vietnam's feuding generals to engage in even more in-fighting at the expense of the war effort, thus creating a vicious circle where the Americans would do all the fighting while the ARVN did nothing, leading to a situation where more and more Americans would be needed.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=410}} After a Viet Cong attack on the American air base at Pleiku in February 1965, Johnson called a meeting at the White House attended by his national security team plus Mansfield and McCormack to announce that \"I've had enough of this\" and that he had decided on a bombing campaign.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=413}} Only Mansfield and the Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] opposed the plans to bomb North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=413}} Johnson ordered [[Operation Flaming Dart]] on 7 February 1965, a bombing raid on a North Vietnamese Army base, which marked the beginning of a series of increasing intense bombing raids.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=413}} The British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], who was strongly opposed to the United States fighting a war in Asia which would distract American attention from Europe, wrote to Johnson proposing a summit in Washington, where he intended to press Johnson to not use his powers under the resolution to fight war in Vietnam.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=342}} Johnson phoned Wilson to say the proposed summit was superfluous, maintaining he could not see \"what was to be gained by flapping around the Atlantic with our coattails out\", and instead urged Wilson to send British troops to fight in Vietnam.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=342}} On 22 February 1965, the commander of the U.S. forces in Vietnam, General [[William Westmoreland]], stated that he had no confidence in the ability of the ARVN to protect the American air base at Danang and asked for two Marine battalions to protect it, a request that Johnson approved.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=415}} On 2 March 1965, Johnson ordered [[Operation Rolling Thunder]], the strategic bombing offensive against North Vietnam that had long been urged upon him.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=415}} On 8 March 1965, two battalions of Marines landed at Danang to fulfill Westmoreland's request for troops to protect the air base.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=412}} \n\nFulbright who developed doubts by this point advised Johnson that a \"massive ground and air war in Southeast Asia\" would be a \"disaster\", but Johnson now had the legal power to wage war as he saw fit and disregarded his warning not send any more troops.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=418}} The Joint Chiefs of Staff led by Wheeler now recommended further troops to Vietnam and on 1 April 1965 Johnson agreed to send 2 more Marine battalions plus 28, 000 logistic troops.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=417}} At the same time, Johnson approved Westmoreland's request for \"offensive defense\" by allowing the Marines to patrol the countryside instead of just guarding the air base, committing the U.S. to a ground war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=417-418}} Taylor wrote that Johnson having \"crossed the Rubicon\" with Rolling Thunder \"was now off to Rome on the double\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=420}} On 20 April 1965, Johnson approved a plan to send 40, 000 U.S Army troops to South Vietnam by June.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=420}} In June, Westmoreland reported \"The South Vietnamese armed forces cannot stand up to this pressure without substantial U.S. combat troops on the ground\" and stated that he needed 180, 000 men immediately, a request that was granted in July.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=422-426}} On 28 July 1965, Johnson gave a TV speech saying: \"I have asked the commanding general, General Westmoreland, what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression. He has told me. And we will meet his needs. We cannot be defeated by force of arms. We will stand in Vietnam\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=426}}\n\nIn February 1966, Morse introduced a motion to repeal the resolution, which he argued was unconstitutional and had been used in ways that Johnson had promised that it would not be.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Through Morse's motion had no chance of passing with Senate Majority Leader Mansfield fatalistically saying \"we are in too deep now\", he was able to extend the debate for two weeks.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Morse who was described as a \"skilled parliamentarian\" was able to use various procedural methods to keep the debate going despite Mansfield's efforts, and several senators spoke in favor of the motion.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Russell complained about the \"very great grant of power\" that the resolution had granted Johnson.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Ultimately, most senators followed Johnson's argument that America was at war and it was the patriotic duty of Congress to support the president, no matter what, and only five senators voted for Morse's motion.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n== Repeal ==\n{{U.S. Congressional opposition to war}} By 1967, the rationale for what had become a costly U.S. involvement In the [[Vietnam War]] was receiving close scrutiny. With [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|opposition to the war]] mounting, a movement to repeal the resolution\u2014which war critics decried as having given the Johnson administration a \"[[blank check]]\"\u2014began to gather steam.\n\nAn investigation by the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] revealed that ''Maddox'' had been on an [[reconnaissance|electronic intelligence]] collection [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident#The incident|mission off the North Vietnamese coast]].{{sfn|Finney|1968}} It also learned that the U.S. Naval Communication Center in the Philippine Islands, in reviewing ships' messages, had questioned whether any second attack had actually occurred.{{sfn|NYT|1968}}\n\nThe administration of President [[Richard Nixon]], which took office in January 1969, initially opposed repeal, warning of \"consequences for Southeast Asia [that] go beyond the war in Vietnam\". In 1970 the administration began to shift its stance. It asserted that its conduct of operations in Southeast Asia was based not on the resolution but was a constitutional exercise of the President's authority, as Commander in Chief of U.S. military forces, to take necessary steps to protect American troops as they were gradually withdrawn{{sfn|NYT|1970}} (the U.S. had begun withdrawing its forces from Vietnam in 1969 under a policy known as \"[[Vietnamization]]\").\n\nMounting public opinion against the war eventually led to the repeal of the resolution, which was attached to the [[Foreign Military Sales Act of 1971|Foreign Military Sales Act]] that Nixon signed in January 1971.{{sfn|NYT|1971}} Seeking to restore limits on presidential authority to engage U.S. forces without a formal declaration of war, Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] in 1973, over [[List of United States presidential vetoes#Richard Nixon|Nixon's veto]]. The War Powers Resolution, which is still in effect, sets forth certain requirements for the President to consult with Congress in regard to decisions that engage U.S. forces in hostilities or imminent hostilities.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web|last1=Andrad\u00e9|first1=David|last2=Conboy|first2=Kenneth|url=http://www.usni.org/navalhistory/Articles99/NHandrade.htm|title=The Secret Side of the Tonkin Gulf Incident|publisher=Naval History|date=August 1999|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web|last1= Beito|first1=David T.|last2= Beito|first2=Linda Royster |title=The Christian Conservative Who Opposed the Vietnam War|url=http://hnn.us/articles/28879.html|publisher=History News Network|date=August 21, 2006}}\n*{{cite book|last=Berman|first=William|title=William Fulbright and the Vietnam War: The Dissent of a Political Realist|year=1988|publisher=Ohio State University|isbn=0873383516|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite article|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|title=The Foreign Policy of Senator Wayne L.

Johnson]] authorization, without a formal [[Declaration of war by the United States|declaration of war]] by Congress, for the use of [[Conventional warfare|conventional]] military force in [[Southeast Asia]]. Specifically, the resolution authorized the President to do whatever necessary in order to assist \"any member or protocol state of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty]]\". This included involving armed forces.\n\nIt was opposed in the Senate only by Senators [[Wayne Morse]] (D-OR) and [[Ernest Gruening]] (D-AK). Senator Gruening objected to \"sending our American boys into combat in a war in which we have no business, which is not our war, into which we have been misguidedly drawn, which is steadily being escalated\". {{Harv|Tonkin Gulf debate|1964}} The Johnson administration subsequently relied upon the resolution to begin its rapid escalation of U.S. military involvement in [[South Vietnam]] and open warfare between [[North Vietnam]] and the [[United States]].\n\n==Towards the Incident ==\nThroughout 1963, the Kennedy administration have become concerned that the South Vietnamese regime of Ngo Dinh Diem was losing the war to the Viet Cong. Such concerns were intensified after Diem was overthrown and killed on 2 November 1963. On 19 December 1963, the Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] visited Saigon and reported to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] that the situation was \"very disturbing\" as \"current trends, unless reversed in the next two or three months, will lead to neutralization at best or more likely to a Communist-controlled state\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} McNamara further reported the Viet Cong were winning the war as they controlled \"larger percentages of the population, greater amounts of territory and have destroyed or occupied more strategic hamlets than expected\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} About the Revolutionary Command Council as the South Vietnamese military junta called itself, McNamara was scathing, saying \"there is no organized government in South Vietnam\" as the junta was \"indecisive and drifting\" with the generals being \"so preoccupied with essentially political affairs\" that they had no time for the war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} \n\nIn response to McNamara's report, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended the United States intervene in the war, with the Air Force's commander, General [[Curtis LeMay]], calling for a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam, saying \"we are swatting flies when we should be going after the manure pile\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=325}} Using less earthly language than LeMay, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] in a report to Johnson called South Vietnam \"pivotal\" to the United States's \"worldwide confrontation with Communism\" and predicated that to allow South Vietnam to fall to the Viet Cong would be such a blow to American \"durability, resolution and trustworthiness\" that all of Asia might very well be lost to Communism.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}}  Taylor also argued that to see South Vietnam fall to the Viet Cong would so damage \"our image\" in Africa and Latin America that both of those regions might also be lost to Communism as well.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} Given these stakes with Taylor claiming the entire Third World would be lost to Communism if South Vietnam went Communist, he argued for drastic measures, saying the United States should taking \"increasing bolder\" measures with the United States to start bombing North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}}The journalist [[Stanley Karnow]] wrote Taylor had offered up an \"inflated\" version of the \"domino theory\" with the entire Third World potentially lost to Communism if South Vietnam became the first \"domino\" to fall.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} \n\nThough Johnson was planning as president to focus on domestic affairs such as civil rights for Afro-Americans together with social legislation to improve the lot of the poor, he was very afraid that to \"lose\" South Vietnam would cause him to be branded as \"soft on Communism\", the dreaded accusation that could end the career of any American politician at the time.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} Rather than the ''primat der aussenpolitik'' reason of the \"domino theory\", Johnson was more motivated by the ''primat der innenpolitik'' reason of the fear that if South Vietnam was \"lost\", it would generate a right-wing backlash similar to the one generated by the \"[[loss of China]]\" in 1949, which allowed Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] to achieve national prominence.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=330}} The fear that a new McCarthy-type Republican politician would emerge and derail his domestic reforms was Johnson's primary reason for refusing to accept the possibility of South Vietnam being \"lost\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=330}} Johnson's determination to not \"lose\" South Vietnam extended to rejecting a peace plan put forward by the French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] who favored having South Vietnam becoming neutral in the Cold War in order to provide with Americans with an honorable way to disengage from Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=337}} Through not keen on fighting a war in Vietnam, Johnson told Taylor and other the chiefs of staff at a Christmas Eve party in 1963: \"Just let me get elected, and then you can have your war\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=326}} The instability of South Vietnamese politics suggested it was impossible for the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam-i.e. the South Vietnamese Army) to focus on the war. Johnson stated at a meeting in the Oval Office that he was fed up with \"this coup shit\", and shortly there afterwards another coup took place in Saigon as General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]] overthrew General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] on 30 January 1964.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=334-335}} \n\nThrough the United States had long denounced the government of North Vietnam for trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam, accusing Hanoi of \"aggression\", the government of South Vietnam had with American support also been trying to overthrow the government of North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} Ever since the Geneva Accords had partitioned Vietnam in 1954, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been training squads of South Vietnamese volunteers and infiltrating them into North Vietnam with the aim of starting an anti-Communist guerrilla war with a spectacular lack of success.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} For an example, of the 80 teams that were infiltrated into North Vietnam in 1963, all of were captured, causing one CIA agent to later say: \"I didn't mind butchering the enemy, but we were butchering our own allies\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} In January 1964, Johnson gave his approval for a plan to step up the pace and intensity of the covert war against North Vietnam, which was code-named [[Operation 34A]].{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363}} Johnson had hopes that Operation 34A might at best lead to the overthrow of North Vietnam's Communist government and at worse might so weaken North Vietnam as to end the war in South Vietnam. As part of Operation 34A, starting on 1 February 1964, South Vietnamese commandos began to conduct maritime raids on coastal North Vietnam under American naval operational command.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=363-364}}\n\nThe new Kh\u00e1nh government proved to just as ineffective as the previous Minh government had been in fighting the war. In February 1964, [[Lyman Kirkpatrick]], the CIA's Inspector General, visited South Vietnam and reported that he was \"shocked by the number of our people and of the military, even those whose job is always to say that we are winning, who feel the tide is against us\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=340}} The general consensus amongst American Vietnam experts by early 1964 was as one official wrote \"unless there is a marked improvement in the effectiveness of the South Vietnamese government and armed forces\" that South Vietnam had only \"an even chance of withstanding the insurgency menace during the next few weeks or months\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=340-341}} Through in public, the Johnson administration still ruled out American intervention, but in private, Johnson was inclined to listen to the advice of McNamara and Taylor who advised him that only American military intervention could save South Vietnam now as the feuding generals of the Revolutionary Command Council was simply too disunited, too corrupt and too incompetent to win the war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=341}}  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nIn February 1964, [[Walt Whitman Rostow]], the director of the State Department's [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] pointed out a major constitutional problem with the plans to commit American forces to Vietnam, noting under the American constitution only Congress had the power to declare war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=357-358}} Johnson had made it that he was opposed to Kh\u00e1nh's plans to have South Vietnam invade North Vietnam out of the fear of causing a war with China, and he had even less enthusiasm for the United States invading North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=343}} To have the U.S. declare war on North Vietnam would lead to immense domestic pressure to invade North Vietnam. Johnson remembered how in 1950 the approach of U.S. forces upon the Yalu led to Chinese intervention in the Korean War, and was fearful that invading North Vietnam would again led to Chinese intervention. Moreover, unlike in 1950, by 1964 China had nuclear weapons.  To resolve this problem, Rostow suggested to Johnson that Congress pass a resolution authorizing Johnson to use force in Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=358}} \n\nRostow was supported by [[William Bundy]], the assistant secretary for Asia, who advised Johnson in a memo on 1 March 1964 that the U.S Navy should blockade Haiphong and start bombing North Vietnam's railroads, factories, road and training camps.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=344}} Bundy stated that the plans for stepped-up U.S involvement would \"normally require\" a declaration of war from Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=360}} Bundy advised against the \"blunt instrument\" of a declaration of war as at present Johnson still only had only \"selective goals\" in Vietnam, but stated that it would be \"unsatisfactory\" to have Congress not endorse the planned increased involvement in Vietnam for constitutional reasons.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=360}}\u00a0Bundy argued that the \"best answer\" to this problem was an event from Johnson's own career as a Senator when in January 1955 when he voted for the [[Formosa Resolution of 1955|Formosa Resolution]]  giving President Eisenhower the power to use military force \"as he deems necessary\" to protect Taiwan from a Chinese invasion.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=360}} At the time, the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis|Taiwan Strait Crisis]] was raging with the Chinese Communists bombarding several islands in the Taiwan strait still held by the Kuomintang regime in Taiwan, and many believed the congressional resolution giving Eisenhower the legal power to go to war in defense of Taiwan had ended the crisis. \n\nUnlike the 1955 resolution, which Johnson had supported as Senate Majority Leader and used all of his influence to get the other Senators to vote for, the current Senate Majority Leader, [[Mike Mansfield]], was known to be skeptical about using American forces to support South Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} Mansfield, a devout Catholic who was only willing to support wars that met the Catholic definition of a \"just war\" had once been one of South Vietnam's warmest supporters on Capital Hill, but after visiting South Vietnam in late 1962 came back very disillusioned by what he had seen, stating the regime was just as tyrannical as the Viet Cong guerrillas fighting to overthrow it.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=217-219 & 268}} Besides for Mansfield, Bundy predicated problems from Senator [[Wayne Morse]], a stubborn and cantankerous character who was known for his strongly held view that only Congress had power to declare war, and who deeply disliked resolutions like the Formosa resolution as weakening the power of Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} Bundy warned the president that his \"doubtful friends\" in Congress might delay the passage of the desired resolution which would give America's European allies opposed to a war in Southeast Asia the chance to impose \"tremendous pressure\" on the U.S. to \"to stop and negotiate\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} \n\nMcNamara visited South Vietnam for four days starting on 8 March 1964, and upon his return to Washington was even more pessimistic than he been before in December 1963.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=341-342}} McNamara reported to Johnson the situation had \"unquestionably been growing worse\" since his last visit in December as 40% of the countryside was now under Vietcong \"control or predominant influence\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} McNamara further reported that desertion rate in the ARVN was \"high and increasing\"; the Vietcong were \"recruiting energetically\"; the South Vietnamese people were overcome by \"apathy and indifference\"; and the \"greatest weakness\" was the \"uncertain viability\" of Kh\u00e1nh regime which might be overthrown by another coup at any moment.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} In response to McNamara's report, the National Security Council issued an \"action memorandum\" calling for increased military aid to South Vietnam and asserted that Vietnam was a \"test case\" of American global leadership, claiming that a Communist victory in South Vietnam would so damage American prestige that none of America's allies would believe in American promises if South Vietnam was \"lost\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} By presenting the Vietnam war in these stark terms with the melodramatic claim that the United States would cease to be a world power if South Vietnam was \"lost\", the \"action memorandum\" virtually guaranteed American intervention..{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=342}} \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAt the time, Morse was one of the few critics of Johnson's Vietnam policy. In a speech in April 1964, Morse called the war \"McNamara's War\", claiming: \"Not one voice has yet answered my contention that the United States, under the leadership of Defense Secretary McNamara, is fighting an illegal and unwise war in Vietnam.\"{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=22}} As Morse remained outspoken in his criticism of Johnson's Vietnam policy, accusing him of violating international law. on 13 May 1964, Bundy called a meeting to discuss how best to deal with Morse.{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=22}} [[Jonathan Moore (State Department official)|Jonathan Moore]], an aide to Bundy advised him that Morse was correct that the administration was \"on pretty thin ice\" when it came to advocating escalation on the basis of international law.{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=22}} As it was felt that Morse was strong on the legalistic arguments, Moore recommended that the administration \"shift gears rapidly into a general (practical and political) rationale\" and ignore Morse as much as possible.{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=23}} Bundy believed the resolution as he was writing it would give Johnson \"the full support of the school of thought headed by Senator Mansfield and Senator Aiken and leave ourselves with die-hard opposition only from Senator Morse and his very few cohorts.\"{{sfn|Ceplair|2012|p=23}} \n\nBy late May 1964, a rough draft of the resolution that was to become the Gulf of Tonkin resolution had been completed by Bundy which if passed by Congress would give Johnson the legal power to use force to defend any nation in Southeast Asia threatened by \"Communist aggression or subversion\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}}  By the beginning of June 1964, the final draft of the resolution had been completed and all that remained to do was to submit it to Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}} The acting Attorney General, [[Nicholas Katzenbach]], called resolution the \"functional equivalent of a declaration of war\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}} The U.S Air Force had already selected 94 sites in North Vietnam to be bombed while the U.S. Navy had moved a carrier task force into the Gulf of Tonkin with the orders to be prepared for \"reprisal bombings\" of North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}} Initially, the plans called for the United States to respond to guerrilla attacks in South Vietnam with bombing raids over North Vietnam, and then Johnson would submit the resolution to Congress sometime in late June 1964.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361-362}} At the time, Congress was preoccupied with the Civil Rights Act, which was intended to outlaw segregation, a bill that Johnson had supported and was met with fierce resistance from Southern senators and congressmen who did everything within their power to \"kill the bill\". Johnson wanted the Civil Rights Act passed before submitting the resolution to Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=361}} On 15 June 1964, however Johnson's National Security Adviser [[McGeorge Bundy]], told the National Security Council that the president did not feel that Viet Cong attacks on the South Vietnamese government were a sufficient ''casus belli'' as Johnson wanted a North Vietnamese attack on American forces as his ''casus belli'', arguing that Congress would be more likely to pass the resolution if was in response to the latter rather than the former.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=362}}\u00a0On 18 June 1964, the Canadian diplomat [[J. Blair Seaborn]] arrived in Hanoi carrying the message from Johnson that North Vietnam would suffer the \"greatest devastation\" from American bombing if it continued on its present course. {{sfn|Hunt|1993|p=15}} In June 1964, the American ambassador in Saigon, Henry Cabot Lodge, resigned in order to seek the Republican nomination for president. Johnson appointed Taylor as the new ambassador with orders to make the South Vietnamese fight.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=345}} Taylor's successor as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was General [[Earle Wheeler|Earle \"Bus\" Wheeler]]. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n==The Gulf of Tonkin Incident==\n{{main|Gulf of Tonkin incident}}\nSoviet-North Vietnamese relations had badly strained in the early 1960s as North Vietnam moved closer to China, the more militant and aggressive of the two warring Communist giants.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=328}} When [[Mao Zedong]] denounced [[Nikita Khrushchev]] for his \"cowardice\" for choosing a diplomatic compromise to settle the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 instead of a nuclear war against the United States as Mao preferred, North Vietnamese newspapers approvingly cited his remarks.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=328}} Likewise, when Khrushchev signed the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963, Mao again mocked him for his moderation, and was again approvingly quoted by North Vietnamese newspapers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=328}} In a bid to recapture influence lost to China, the Soviet Union sold North Vietnam a radar system that was far more advanced than anything China could produce together with batteries of SAMs (surface-to-air missiles).{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} All through the spring and summer of 1964, Soviet workers were building and installing radar stations together with SAM batteries all over North Vietnam while training the North Vietnamese in their use.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} As the U.S. Air Force and Navy were developing their plans at the same time to bomb North Vietnam, both the admirals and Air Force generals insisted that they needed more information about the radar network the Soviets were installing, most notably the frequencies the radar used in order to develop jamming mechanisms.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} As a result, the U.S. Navy began to increase [[DESOTO patrol|DESOTO patrols]] off the coast of North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} The Navy's tactic was to have South Vietnamese commandos land to attack the North Vietnamese radar stations, forcing the operators to turn on the radars, which thereby allowed the Americans to learn what frequencies they used.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} The South Vietnamese commandos were landed in light, Norwegian-built patrol boats made of aluminium and armed with machine guns and cannons known as the Swift boats.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365}} \n\nBy July 1964, the rugged coastline of North Vietnam with its islands, bays, and estuaries was a war zone with South Vietnamese commandos constantly landing to raid while the North Vietnamese made vigorous efforts to stop the raids.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=365-366}} In support of the raids, an American destroyer, the USS ''Maddox'' was deployed to the Gulf of Tonkin with orders to collect electronic intelligence on the North Vietnamese radar system.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} Admiral [[U. S. Grant Sharp Jr.]], the commander of the Pacific fleet ordered Captain [[John J. Herrick]] of the ''Maddox'' not to go any closer that 8 miles from the coast of North Vietnam and no more than 4 miles from any of the archipelagos off the coast.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} The French had claimed control of only 3 miles of the waters off the coastline of Indochina, a claim that North Vietnam had inherited.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} Subsequently, the North Vietnamese had extended their claim to control of waters 12 miles off their coastline, a claim the United States had declined to recognize.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=366}} On 30 July 1964, South Vietnamese commandos tried to attack the North Vietnamese radar station on the island of Hon Me, but were detected as they were coming in, leading the North Vietnamese to open fire, making any landing impossible.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=367}} The radar on Hon Me was turned on, and the ''Maddox'' stationed off the coast picked up the radar frequency being used.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=367}} North Vietnam made a formal protest about the raid to the International Control Commission consisting of delegations of diplomats from India, Canada and Poland that were supposed to enforce the Geneva Accords, accusing the United States of being behind the raid.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=367}}\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n[[File:President Lyndon B. Johnson signs \"Gulf of Tonkin\" resolution - NARA - 192484.tif|thumbnail|right|President Johnson as he signs the resolution on August 10, 1964]] [[File:Tonkin Gulf Resolution.jpg|thumb|275px]] The {{USS|Maddox|DD-731|6}}, a U.S. [[destroyer]], was conducting a [[DESOTO patrol]] in the waters of the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] on August 2, 1964, when it reported being attacked by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats from the 135th Torpedo Squadron,{{sfn|Moise|1996|pp=50, 78}} which were attempting to close their range on ''Maddox'' for effective torpedo fire (1,000 yards was maximum effective range for the torpedoes){{sfn|Moise|1996|p=71}}{{sfn|Hanyok|2000}} ''Maddox'' fired over 280 5-inch shells{{sfn|Moise|1996|p=78}} and the boat expended their 6 torpedoes (all misses) and some 14.5-mm machinegun fire. Breaking contact, the combatants commenced going their separate ways, when the three torpedo boats, '''T-333''', '''T-336''', and '''T-339''' were then attacked by four USN [[Vought F-8 Crusader|F-8 Crusader]] jet fighter bombers from the aircraft carrier {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}.{{sfn|Moise|1996|p=82}} The Crusaders reported no hits with their [[Zuni (rocket)|Zuni]] rockets, but scored hits on all three torpedo boats with their [[Colt Mk 12 cannon|20-mm cannons]], damaging all three boats. \n\nJohnson was informed of the incident and in the first use of the \"hotline\" to Moscow installed after the Cuban Missile Crisis called Khrushchev in the Kremlin to say that the United States did not want war, but he hoped that the Soviets would use their influence to persuade North Vietnam to not attack American warships.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=368-369}} Through Johnson had now an \"incident\" at sea involving a North Vietnamese attack against American warships, he declined to use it as a reason to present a resolution to Congress. Johnson's fear was that the North Vietnamese could claim that the attempted raid on the radar station on Hon Me on 30 July gave them legitimate fears that the ''Maddox'' might have been moving in for a new attack.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} Johnson wanted an \"incident\" where it was unambiguous that the North Vietnamese were the aggressors by attacking American warships in waters that the American regarded as international. \n\nOut of the hope of provoking such an incident, Johnson ordered the ''Maddox'' to continue to cruise off the coast of North Vietnam, to be joined by another destroyer, USS ''Turner Joy'' with orders \"to attack any force that attacks them\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} Both destroyers were ordered to sail 8 miles from North Vietnam in waters that Americans asserted were international waters, disregarding North Vietnam's claim to the 12-mile limit.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} The Secretary of State, [[Dean Rusk]], ordered his staff to \"pull together\" the resolution Bundy had written in May-June, just in case Johnson decided to submit it to Congress.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=369}} On 3 August 1963, the South Vietnamese in their Swift boats raided Cape Vinhson and Cua Ron.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} The cruise of the American destroyers was not directly connected to the raid, but Herrick knew from reading the summaries of decrypted North Vietnamese radio messages that the North Vietnamese believed that it was.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} Herrick received orders to \"show the gauntlet\" and prove to the North Vietnamese that the Americans would sail off North Vietnam in waters that the Americans insisted were international waters.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}}\u00a0\n\nTwo days later on a very stormy night on August 4, ''Maddox'' and the destroyer [[USS Turner Joy (DD-951)|''Turner Joy'']] both reported to be under attack again, by North Vietnamese torpedo boats; during this alleged engagement, ''Turner Joy'' fired approximately 220 3-inch & 5-inch shells at radar controlled surface targets.{{sfn|Moise|1996|p=158}}{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} In response to the reported attack, aircraft from the ''Ticonderoga''  were launched, but the pilots reported no visual contact with any craft other than the two destroyers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=370}} [[Hanoi]] subsequently insisted that it had not launched a second attack. Through Herrick had reported an attack by North Vietnamese torpedo boats, he soon developed strong doubts about whatever an attack had actually occurred.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Herrick reported to Admiral Sharp that the \"torpedo boats\" were almost certainly radar blips due to the \"freak weather effects\" caused by the storm and that an \"overeager\" sonar operator abroad the ''Maddox'' had mistaken the effects of the storm for torpedoes.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Herrick's report concluded with the statement the \"entire action leaves many doubts\" as he noted that no sailor abroad his ship had seen a torpedo boat nor had heard any gunfire beyond the guns of the ''Turner Joy''.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Likewise no sailor abroad the ''Turner Joy'' claimed to have seen any North Vietnamese craft and none of the pilots of the Crusader aircraft stated that they had seen any torpedo boats.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}}\n\nA later investigation by the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] revealed that ''Maddox'' had been on an [[reconnaissance|electronic intelligence]] ([[DESOTO patrol|DESOTO]]) mission. It also learned that the U.S. Naval Communication Center in the Philippine Islands, in reviewing the ships' messages, had questioned whether any second attack had actually occurred.{{sfn|NYT|1968}} In 2005, an internal National Security Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded that ''Maddox'' had engaged the North Vietnamese Navy on August 2, but that there may not have been any North Vietnamese Naval vessels present during the engagement of August 4. The report stated:\n\n{{quote|It is not simply that there is a different story as to what happened; it is that no attack happened that night. ... In truth, Hanoi's navy was engaged in nothing that night but the salvage of two of the boats damaged on August 2.{{sfn|Hanyok|2000|p=3}} }}\n\nIn 1965, President Johnson commented privately: \"For all I know, our Navy was shooting at whales out there.\"{{sfn|KQED|2006}}\n\n==Congress votes==\nEarly on the morning of 4 August 1964, Johnson told several congressmen at a meeting that North Vietnam had just attacked an American patrol in the Gulf of Tonkin in international waters and promised retaliation.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} At the same time, Johnson also stated that he wanted Congress to vote for a resolution of support.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} After the meeting, Johnson told one of his aides, [[Kenneth O'Donnell|Kenny O'Donnell]], that he felt he was \"being tested\" by North Vietnam with both agreeing that how the president handled the crisis would affect the election.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} O'Donnell recalled that Johnson's main fear was the incident might allow his Republican opponent in the election, Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], a chance to gain in the polls.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} O'Donnell added that Johnson felt that he \"must not allow them [the Republicans] to accuse him of vacillating or being an indecisive leader\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} \n\nThe equivocal nature of Captain Herrick's reports were a worrisome factor, and Johnson informed McNamara, the member of the cabinet that he trusted the most, to ensure that the naval report remove all of the ambiguous elements.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} In turn, McNamara phoned Admiral Sharp to say the president was keen to launch a retaliatory raid, but could not move \"unless we are dammed sure what happened\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}} Admiral Sharp in turn applied strong pressure on Herrick to rewrite his report to \"confirm absolutely\" that his patrol had been just attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=371}}\u00a0At the same time that Sharp was pressuring Herrick, Johnson had summoned McNamara to the White House to point out to him the best places to bomb in North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}} The British ambassador, [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|Lord Harlech]], and the West German ambassador, [[Karl Heinrich Knappstein]], were summoned to the State Department to be told that the United States would be launching a major bombing raid on North Vietnam very soon.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}}\u00a0A press release from the Defense Department accused North Vietnam of a \"second deliberate attack\" on American warships in international waters.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}} Johnson invited 18 Senators and congressmen led by Mansfield to the White House to inform them he had ordered a bombing raid on North Vietnam and asked for their support for a resolution.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=302-303}} Most were supportive, through Mansfield still had doubts, saying he preferred the matter be referred to the United Nations.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=303}} Rusk assured Mansfield that he would liked to take the matter up at the UN, but the possibility of a Soviet veto at the UN left the president no choice.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=303}} After the meeting, Johnson summoned his National Security Adviser, [[McGeorge Bundy|McGeorge \"Mac\" Bundy]], to tell him: \"You know that resolution your brother's been talking about for the past few months? Well, now's the time to get it through Congress\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=305}} When Bundy replied \"Mr. President, that seems too fast for me\", Johnson growled \"I didn't ask you that question. I want you to do it\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=305}}\u00a0 \n\nWithin hours, President Johnson ordered the launching of retaliatory air strikes ([[Operation Pierce Arrow]]) on the bases of the North Vietnamese torpedo boats and announced, in a television address to the American public that same evening, that U.S. naval forces had been attacked. Johnson in his television address announced: \"Repeated acts of violence against the armed forces of the United States must be met not only with alert defense, but with positive reply. That reply is being given as I speak tonight\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=372}} Johnson requested approval of a resolution \"expressing the unity and determination of the United States in supporting freedom and in protecting peace in southeast Asia\", stating that the resolution should express support \"for all necessary action to protect our Armed Forces\", but repeated previous assurances that \"the United States ... seeks no wider war\". As the nation entered the final three months of political campaigning for the 1964 elections (in which Johnson was standing for election), the president contended that the resolution would help \"hostile nations ... understand\" that the United States was unified in its determination \"to continue to protect its national interests\".{{sfn|President's Message to Congress|1964}} \n\nThe [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) had broken North Vietnam's codes, and McNamara put much emphasis to Johnson on certain decrypts speaking of North Vietnamese torpedo boats having been damaged by American destroyers as proving the second incident happened.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=373}} However, several intelligence analysis at the time accused McNamara of having either have misinterpreted, either intentionally or by mistake, decrypts referring to the first incident of 2 August and presenting them as referring to the second alleged incident of 4 August.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=373-374}} [[Ray S. Cline]], the deputy director of the CIA later stated: \"I felt from the start that the second incident had been questionable, but I simply wasn't sure. However, after a number of days collating and examining the reports relating to the second incident, I concluded that they were either unsound or that they dealt with the first incident\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Cline was told to keep his doubts to himself.\n\nOn 5 August 1964, Johnson submitted the resolution to Congress, which if passed would give him the legal power to \"take all necessary measures\" and \"prevent further aggression\" as well as allowing him to decide when \"peace and security\" in Southeast Asia were attained.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Johnson commented the resolution was \"like grandma's nightshirt-it covered everything\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Despite his public claims of \"aggression\", Johnson in private believed that the second incident had not taken place, saying at a meeting in the Oval Office in his Texas twang: \"Hell, those dumb stupid sailors were just shooting at flying fish\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} The president's two chosen instruments for passing the resolution were the Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] and Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} McNamara had the image of the \"whiz kid\", a man of almost superhuman intelligence and ability whose computer-generated graphs and spreadsheets showed the best way to \"scientifically\" solve any problem.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} McNamara, whose statements always seemed to be backed up by the Pentagon's computers had the ability to \"dazzle\" Congress and whatever he requested of Congress tended to be approved.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} Fulbright, through too much an individualist and an intellectual to fit into the Senate's \"Club\", was widely respected as the Senate's resident foreign policy expert and as a defender of Congress's prerogatives.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} If Fulbright backed the resolution, Johnson knew that he would probably carry over the doubters and waverers, of which there were several.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Johnson knew that the conservative Republicans together with the conservative Southern Democrats would vote for the resolution, but he did not want to be dependent upon their support for his foreign policy as his domestic policies were anathema to them.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}}\u00a0From Johnson's viewpoint, having liberal Democrats and liberal Republicans vote for the resolution would free his hands to carry out the domestic reforms he wanted to have Congress pass after the election.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} \u00a0\n\nOn 5 August 1964, Fulbright arrived at the White House to meet Johnson, where the president asked his old friend to use all his influence to get the resolution passed.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}}  Johnson insisted quite vehemently to Fulbright that the alleged attack on the destroyers had taken place and it was only later that Fulbright became skeptical about whatever the alleged attack had really taken place.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Furthermore, Johnson insisted the resolution, which was a \"functional equivalent to a declaration of war\" was not intended to be used for going to war in Vietnam.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} In the 1964 election, the Republicans had nominated Goldwater as their candidate, who ran on a platform accusing Johnson of being \"soft on Communism\" and by contrast promised a \"total victory\" over Communism.\u00a0Johnson argued to Fulbright that the resolution was an election year stunt that would prove to the voters that he was really \"tough on Communism\" and thus dent the appeal of Goldwater by denying him of his main avenue of attack.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Besides for the ''primat der innenpolitik'' reason Johnson gave for the resolution, he also gave a ''primat der aussenpolitik'' reason, arguing that such a resolution would intimidate North Vietnam into ceasing to try to overthrow the government of South Vietnam, and as such Congress passing a resolution would make American involvement in Vietnam less likely rather than more likely.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Fulbright's longstanding friendship with Johnson made it difficult for him to go against the president, who cunningly exploited Fulbright's vulnerability, namely his desire to have greater influence over foreign policy.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Johnson gave Fulbright the impression that he would be one of his unofficial advisers on foreign policy and that he was very interested in turning his ideas into policies, provided that he voted for the resolution, which was a test of their friendship.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}}  Johnson also hinted that he was thinking about sacking Rusk if he won the 1964 election and would consider nominating Fulbright to be the next Secretary of State.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Fulbright had much contempt for whoever happened to be Secretary of State, always believing that he understood foreign policy better than any of them, and had a particular contempt for Rusk, so the offer to be Secretary of State was tempting for him.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=306}} Fulbright also felt a strong rapport with his fellow Southerner Johnson, the first Southern president since Wilson.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=306}} \u00a0Finally, for Fulbright in 1964 it was inconceivable that Johnson would lie to him and he believed the resolution \"was not going to be used for anything other than the Tonkin Gulf incident itself\" as Johnson had told him.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=25}} Johnson told Fulbright he wanted the resolution passed by the widest possible margin to show North Vietnam that Congress was united behind the administration.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Despite all of Johnson's efforts, there was little danger of the resolution not being passed. A public opinion poll at the time showed that 85% of Americans felt that Congress should pass the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=374}} \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nOn August 6, [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara|Robert S. McNamara]] testified before a joint session of the Senate [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services]] committees. He stated that ''Maddox'' had been \"carrying out a routine mission of the type we carry out all over the world at all times\" and denied that it had been in any way involved in South Vietnamese patrol boat raids on the offshore islands of Hon Me and Hon Nieu on the nights of July 30 and July 31.{{sfn|NYT|1968}} In his testimony, McNamara accused North Vietnam of \"aggression\" and of an \"unprovoked attack\" on the destroyers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} Senator [[Wayne Morse]] had been tipped off by a source inside the Pentagon about Operation 34A, and asked McNamara about there was any connection between the activities of the ''Maddox'' and Operation 34A, leading to a blunt denial.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} In response to Morse's question, McNamara answered dismissively: \"Our navy played absolutely no part in, was not associated with, was not aware of any South Vietnamese actions, if there were any...I say this flatly. This is a fact\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} The administration did not, however, disclose that the island raids, although separate from the mission of ''Maddox'', had been part of a program of clandestine attacks on North Vietnamese installations called [[Operation 34A|Operation Plan 34A]]. These operations were carried out by U.S.-trained South Vietnamese [[commando]]s under the control of a [[United States Special Operations Forces|special operations unit]] of the U.S. [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] called the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group|Studies and Operations Group]].{{sfn|Andrad\u00e9|Conboy|1999}}\n\nDespite McNamara's statement, Morse appeared before an almost empty Senate later on 6 August 1964 to say: \"The place to settle the controversy is not on the battlefield but around the conference table\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} Morse was supported only by Senator [[Ernest Gruening]] who stated in a speech \"all Vietnam is not worth the life of a single American boy\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} Senator [[Richard Russell Jr.]], who previously had doubts about Vietnam and whose friendship with Johnson had just been destroyed by the latter's support for the Civil Rights Act, supported the resolution, saying: \"Our national honor is at stake. We cannot and will not shrink from defending it\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=375}} On 6 August 1964, Fulbright gave a speech on the Senate floor calling for the resolution to be passed as he accused North Vietnam of \"aggression\" and praised Johnson for his \"great restraint...in response to the provocation of a small power\".{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} He also declared his support for the Johnson administration's \"noble\" Vietnam policy, which he called a policy of seeking \"...to establish viable, independent states in Indochina and elsewhere which will be free and secure from the combination of Communist China and Communist North Vietnam\".{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} Fulbright concluded that this policy could be accomplished via diplomatic means and echoing Johnson's thesis, argued that it was necessary to pass the resolution as a way to intimidate North Vietnam who would presumably change their policies towards South Vietnam once Congress passed the resolution.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} Fulbright called the resolution a mechanism \"calculated to prevent the spread of war\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} \n\nAt a crucial meeting of several Senators, Fulbright was able to persuade them to support the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Several Senators such as [[Allen J. Ellender]], [[Jacob Javits]], [[John Sherman Cooper]], [[Daniel Brewster]], [[George McGovern]] and [[Gaylord Nelson]] were very reluctant to vote for a resolution that would be a \"blank cheque\" for a war in southeast Asia, and at the meeting Fulbright called to discuss the issue, he argued that passing a resolution would make fighting a war less likely, claiming the whole purpose of the resolution was only intimidation.{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=26}} Nelson wanted to add an amendment forbidding Johnson from sending troops to fight in Vietnam unless Congress gave its approval first, saying he did not like the open-ended nature of the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}}{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=27}} Fulbright dissuaded him, saying he had the president's word that \"the last thing we want to do is become involved in a land war in Asia\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Fulbright argued to Nelson the resolution was \"harmless\" while saying that the real purpose of the resolution was \"to pull the rug out from under Goldwater\", going on to ask Nelson who did he prefer to win the election, Johnson or Goldwater?{{sfn|Berman|1988|p=27}} From the viewpoint of Nelson, a liberal Democrat known for his support of environmentalism, Johnson was a far more preferable president than Goldwater, the leader of the right-wing of the Republican Party. \n\nAfter fewer than nine hours of committee consideration and floor debate, Congress voted, on August 10, 1964, on a joint [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] authorizing the president \"to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty]] requesting assistance in defense of its freedom\". {{Harv|H.J. RES 1145|1964}} The unanimous affirmative vote in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was 416\u20130. (However, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Eugene Siler]] of [[Kentucky]], who was not present but opposed the measure, was [[Pair (parliamentary convention)|\"paired\"]] with another member who favored the resolution\u2014i.e., his opposition was not counted, but the vote in favor was one less than it would have been.) The [[United States Senate|Senate]] conferred its approval by a vote of 88\u20132. Some members expressed misgivings about the measure, but in the end, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senators [[Wayne Morse]] of [[Oregon]] and [[Ernest Gruening]] of [[Alaska]] cast the only nay votes.{{sfn|Kenworthy|1964}} At the time, Senator Morse warned that \"I believe this resolution to be a historic mistake.\"{{sfn|Tonkin Gulf debate|1964}} Morse also predicated that those who voted for the resolution \"will live to regret it\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Much to Johnson's satisfaction, Senator Goldwater voted for the resolution as appropriate, which allowed the president to present himself as just \"tough on Communism\" as his opponent.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=306}}\u00a0  \u00a0\n\nAfter the resolution was passed, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, [[John W. McCormack]] called Johnson to congratulate him.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=307}} The call was recorded and Johnson spent much time denouncing Morse as mentally unstable and untrustworthy while he called Gruening an ingrate, saying \"He's just no good. I've spent millions on him up in Alaska\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=307}} Rostow was ebullient and stated: \"The second attack probably hadn't happened, but it was the chance to do what we should have been doing all along\".{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=307}}\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\n==As a policy instrument==\nThe passage of the resolution alarmed several American allies who preferred that the United States not fight in Vietnam such as Canada. [[J. Blair Seaborn]], the Canadian diplomat who served as Canada's representative to the [[International Control Commission]] engaged in secret \"shuttle diplomacy\" carrying messages back and forth from Hanoi to Washington in an attempt to stop the escalation of the war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} On 13 August 1964, Seaborn arrived in Hanoi to meet the North Vietnamese Premier, [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]].{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Seaborn told \u0110\u1ed3ng that based on his recent meetings with Johnson that he was seriously using the powers he just gained from the Gulf of Tonkin resolution to go to war, but also stated that Johnson was willing to offer \"economic and other benefits\" if only North Vietnam ceased trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=376}} Seaborn further stated that Johnson had told him that North Vietnam would \"suffer the consequences\" if it continued on its \"present course\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=377}} \u0110\u1ed3ng rejected the offer, saying he would rather see the war engulf \"the whole of Southeast Asia\" than to abandon the vision of one Communist Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=377}}\n\nThrough Johnson now had the power to wage war in Vietnam, he proved reluctant  to use it, instead hoping that Ambassador Taylor could somehow pressure the South Vietnamese to fight better.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=377-378}}  On 11 August 1964, William Bundy wrote a memo on the \"next course of action\", under which predicated that unless South Vietnamese \"morale and momentum\" could be improved, the regime of General Khanh would collapse.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=396-397}} Bundy recommended a programme of gradually increasing escalation to achieve \"maximum results for minimal risks\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=396-397}} Bundy argued for August, the United States should do nothing to \"take onus off the Communist side for escalation\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} Starting in September, the memo advocated more DESOTO patrols, 34A raids, and for the United States to start bombing the part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail running through neutral Laos.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} In January 1965, Bundy stated the \"next move upward\" would begin with a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} Taylor objected to Bundy's plan, stating if the U.S started bombing North Vietnam, it would trigger a North Vietnamese response that the South Vietnamese would not be able to handle on their own.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} Taylor, who had become increasingly disillusioned with South Vietnam as Khanh drove him to exasperation with his stupidity wrote: \"We should not get involved militarily with North Vietnam and possibly with Red China if our base in South Vietnam is insecure and Khanh's army is tied down everywhere by the Vietcong insurgency\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397}} General Wheeler and the rest of Joint Chiefs of Staff rejected Taylor's advice and advocated an immediate strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=397-398}} On 7 September 1964, Johnson called a meeting at the White House attended by McNamara, Rusk, Wheeler, the Bundy brothers and Taylor to discuss what to do.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=398}} Taylor conceded that there \"only the emergence of an exceptional leader could improve the situation and there is no George Washington in sight\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=399}} The meeting concluded that the U.S. would react \"as appropriate\" against \"any\" attacks against American forces.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=399}} A war game conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September 1963 code-named Sigma I found that the U.S. would have to commit half-million troops to have a chance of victory in Vietnam; its sequel code-named Sigma II in September 1964 reached the same conclusion and found that despite the claims of General LeMay that a strategical bombing campaign would not be decisive, instead stating that the war would only be won on the ground.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=399}} \u00a0\n\nOn 1 November 1964, Viet Cong guerrillas attacked the American air field at the [[Bien Hoa Air Base]], killing 5 American servicemen and destroying 6 B-57 bombers.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=402}} Wheeler recommended an immediate bombing campaign against North Vietnam, but Johnson demurred, instead creating a \"working group\" to consider scenarios for American intervention.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=402-403}} The conclusion of the \"working group\" chaired by William Bundy when presented in late November resorted to the bureaucratic device of the \"Goldilocks's Principle\" by presenting Johnson with two extreme options of either invading North Vietnam or abandoning South Vietnam; in between the two extremes was the third option of gradual escalation, which Bundy knew that Johnson would chose.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=404}} On 1 December 1964, McNamara, Rusk and \"Mac\" Bundy presented Johnson again with the \"Goldilock's Principle\" by giving him three options, knowing he would chose the third as invading North Vietnam and abandoning South Vietnam were too extreme for him.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=406}} Johnson agreed to their advice to launch [[Operation Barrel Roll]] to bomb the Lao section of the Ho Chi Minh trail and for more 34A raids.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=406}} On Christmas Eve 1964, the Viet Cong bombed the Brinks Hotel in Saigon, killing two Americans.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=408}} Despite almost unanimous advice to bomb North Vietnam, Johnson refused, saying in a cable to Taylor \"The final responsibility is mine and the stakes are very high indeed\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=409}} Johnson added: \"I have never felt that this war will be won from the air, and it seems to me that what is much needed and would be more effective is a larger and stronger use of Rangers and Special Forces and Marines, or other appropriate military strength on the ground and on scene..I know that it might involve the acceptance of larger Americans sacrifices but I myself am ready to substantially increase the Americans in Vietnam if it is necessary to provide this kind of fighting force against the Vietcong\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=409}}\n\nAs Johnson continued to procrastinate, he repeatedly received advice from McNamara, the Bundy brothers, Rusk, Wheeler and Taylor that now was the time to use his powers under the resolution.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=409-411}} A memo co-written by \"Mac\" Bundy and McNamara in January 1965 stated \"our present policy can lead only to a disastrous defeat\" with the alternative being either \"salvage what little can be saved\" by withdrawing or to commit American forces to war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=411}} By contrast, Taylor advised Johnson against committing American troops, stating that having the Americans \"carry the ball\" would only encourage South Vietnam's feuding generals to engage in even more in-fighting at the expense of the war effort, thus creating a vicious circle where the Americans would do all the fighting while the ARVN did nothing, leading to a situation where more and more Americans would be needed.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=410}} After a Viet Cong attack on the American air base at Pleiku in February 1965, Johnson called a meeting at the White House attended by his national security team plus Mansfield and McCormack to announce that \"I've had enough of this\" and that he had decided on a bombing campaign.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=413}} Only Mansfield and the Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] opposed the plans to bomb North Vietnam.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=413}} Johnson ordered [[Operation Flaming Dart]] on 7 February 1965, a bombing raid on a North Vietnamese Army base, which marked the beginning of a series of increasing intense bombing raids.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=413}} The British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], who was strongly opposed to the United States fighting a war in Asia which would distract American attention from Europe, wrote to Johnson proposing a summit in Washington, where he intended to press Johnson to not use his powers under the resolution to fight war in Vietnam.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=342}} Johnson phoned Wilson to say the proposed summit was superfluous, maintaining he could not see \"what was to be gained by flapping around the Atlantic with our coattails out\", and instead urged Wilson to send British troops to fight in Vietnam.{{sfn|Langguth|2000|p=342}} On 22 February 1965, the commander of the U.S. forces in Vietnam, General [[William Westmoreland]], stated that he had no confidence in the ability of the ARVN to protect the American air base at Danang and asked for two Marine battalions to protect it, a request that Johnson approved.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=415}} On 2 March 1965, Johnson ordered [[Operation Rolling Thunder]], the strategic bombing offensive against North Vietnam that had long been urged upon him.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=415}} On 8 March 1965, two battalions of Marines landed at Danang to fulfill Westmoreland's request for troops to protect the air base.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=412}} \n\nFulbright who developed doubts by this point advised Johnson that a \"massive ground and air war in Southeast Asia\" would be a \"disaster\", but Johnson now had the legal power to wage war as he saw fit and disregarded his warning not send any more troops.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=418}} The Joint Chiefs of Staff led by Wheeler now recommended further troops to Vietnam and on 1 April 1965 Johnson agreed to send 2 more Marine battalions plus 28, 000 logistic troops.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=417}} At the same time, Johnson approved Westmoreland's request for \"offensive defense\" by allowing the Marines to patrol the countryside instead of just guarding the air base, committing the U.S. to a ground war.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=417-418}} Taylor wrote that Johnson having \"crossed the Rubicon\" with Rolling Thunder \"was now off to Rome on the double\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=420}} On 20 April 1965, Johnson approved a plan to send 40, 000 U.S Army troops to South Vietnam by June.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=420}} In June, Westmoreland reported \"The South Vietnamese armed forces cannot stand up to this pressure without substantial U.S. combat troops on the ground\" and stated that he needed 180, 000 men immediately, a request that was granted in July.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=422-426}} On 28 July 1965, Johnson gave a TV speech saying: \"I have asked the commanding general, General Westmoreland, what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression. He has told me. And we will meet his needs. We cannot be defeated by force of arms. We will stand in Vietnam\".{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=426}}\n\nIn February 1966, Morse introduced a motion to repeal the resolution, which he argued was unconstitutional and had been used in ways that Johnson had promised that it would not be.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Through Morse's motion had no chance of passing with Senate Majority Leader Mansfield fatalistically saying \"we are in too deep now\", he was able to extend the debate for two weeks.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Morse who was described as a \"skilled parliamentarian\" was able to use various procedural methods to keep the debate going despite Mansfield's efforts, and several senators spoke in favor of the motion.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Russell complained about the \"very great grant of power\" that the resolution had granted Johnson.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} Ultimately, most senators followed Johnson's argument that America was at war and it was the patriotic duty of Congress to support the president, no matter what, and only five senators voted for Morse's motion.{{sfn|Karnow|1983|p=491}} \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n== Repeal ==\n{{U.S. Congressional opposition to war}} By 1967, the rationale for what had become a costly U.S. involvement In the [[Vietnam War]] was receiving close scrutiny. With [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|opposition to the war]] mounting, a movement to repeal the resolution\u2014which war critics decried as having given the Johnson administration a \"[[blank check]]\"\u2014began to gather steam.\n\nAn investigation by the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] revealed that ''Maddox'' had been on an [[reconnaissance|electronic intelligence]] collection [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident#The incident|mission off the North Vietnamese coast]].{{sfn|Finney|1968}} It also learned that the U.S. Naval Communication Center in the Philippine Islands, in reviewing ships' messages, had questioned whether any second attack had actually occurred.{{sfn|NYT|1968}}\n\nThe administration of President [[Richard Nixon]], which took office in January 1969, initially opposed repeal, warning of \"consequences for Southeast Asia [that] go beyond the war in Vietnam\". In 1970 the administration began to shift its stance. It asserted that its conduct of operations in Southeast Asia was based not on the resolution but was a constitutional exercise of the President's authority, as Commander in Chief of U.S. military forces, to take necessary steps to protect American troops as they were gradually withdrawn{{sfn|NYT|1970}} (the U.S. had begun withdrawing its forces from Vietnam in 1969 under a policy known as \"[[Vietnamization]]\").\n\nMounting public opinion against the war eventually led to the repeal of the resolution, which was attached to the [[Foreign Military Sales Act of 1971|Foreign Military Sales Act]] that Nixon signed in January 1971.{{sfn|NYT|1971}} Seeking to restore limits on presidential authority to engage U.S. forces without a formal declaration of war, Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] in 1973, over [[List of United States presidential vetoes#Richard Nixon|Nixon's veto]]. The War Powers Resolution, which is still in effect, sets forth certain requirements for the President to consult with Congress in regard to decisions that engage U.S. forces in hostilities or imminent hostilities.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web|last1=Andrad\u00e9|first1=David|last2=Conboy|first2=Kenneth|url=http://www.usni.org/navalhistory/Articles99/NHandrade.htm|title=The Secret Side of the Tonkin Gulf Incident|publisher=Naval History|date=August 1999|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web|last1= Beito|first1=David T.|last2= Beito|first2=Linda Royster |title=The Christian Conservative Who Opposed the Vietnam War|url=http://hnn.us/articles/28879.html|publisher=History News Network|date=August 21, 2006}}\n*{{cite book|last=Berman|first=William|title=William Fulbright and the Vietnam War: The Dissent of a Political Realist|year=1988|publisher=Ohio State University|isbn=0873383516|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite article|last=Ceplair|first=Larry|title=The Foreign Policy of Senator Wayne L.

{"title_page": "History of Rijeka", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n[[Rijeka]], formerly known as Fiume, is a city located in the northern tip of the [[Kvarner Gulf]] in the northern [[Adriatic]]. It was part of the Roman province of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], and later of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925&ndash;1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]]. It grew during the 12th to 14th centuries as a seaport within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], trading with Italian cities. Under the ownership of the [[House of Habsburg]] from 1466, it was made a free city, and although part of the [[Duchy of Carniola]] it developed organs of local self-government. \n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries Rijeka came under attack from both [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] forces, and became a base for irregular Habsburg troops known as [[Uskoks]]. Its maritime trade was suppressed by Venice until the late 17th century, when peace was concluded and the Habsburgs set about developing the city as a major port. [[Sugar refinery|Sugar refineries]] and other industries were also introduced. Rijeka was attached to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1779, retaining autonomous status, although the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] also maintained a claim. \n\nRijeka was occupied by [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] between 1809 and 1813 as part of the [[Illyrian Provinces]]. After reconquest by Austria, it was placed within the [[Kingdom of Illyria (1816\u201349)|Kingdom of Illyria]] until 1822 and then restored to Hungary. Industrial development recommenced, the port was modernised and a naval base created, and railways were constructed connecting the city with Hungary and Serbia. On the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Hungary]] gained equal status with Austria, and Rijeka, as Hungary's main port, became a rival to Austria's port of [[Trieste]]. Under the leadership of [[Giovanni de Ciotta]] the city was extensively rebuilt during the late 19th century. Resulting from further industrial expansion and immigration, Italians became the largest single group in the city.\n\nOn the defeat and [[Austria-Hungary#Dissolution|dissolution]] of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918, Italy and the new [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) both laid claim to Rijeka. Negotiations in 1919 at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] were pre-empted by the ''coup'' led by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], setting up the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]] based in the city. This was suppressed by Italian troops the next year, and under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]] the independent [[Free State of Fiume]] was established. However, after [[Benito Mussolini]] became ruler in Italy, Rijeka (as Fiume) was annexed to Italy in 1924.\n\nRijeka was occupied by German troops in 1943 after Italy [[Armistice of Cassibile|came to terms]] with the [[Allies of World War II]], and experienced extensive damage from Allied bombing. After fierce fighting it was captured on 3 May 1945 by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] forces and annexed to the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] under the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaty of 1947]]. Most of the Italian population fled or were removed, and were subsequently replaced by incomers from other parts of Yugoslavia. Rijeka became the largest port in Yugoslavia, and other growth sectors included port traffic, oil and coal. On the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, Rijeka became part of independent [[Croatia]], but has experienced economic difficulties with the closure of many of its older industries. \n\n== Origins ==\nThe region of [[Kvarner Gulf|Quarnero]] (Fiume was still not mentioned) fell within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], with the acquisition of the titles of Margraves of [[Istria]] and Dukes of [[Merania]] by the [[Andechs]] family. The possession was called Merania ({{lang-de|meer}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"sea\") meaning \"littoral\" ({{lang-de|K\u00fcstenland}}).\n\nThe counts of [[Duino]] (Tibein), were the first feudal lords of Fiume, from the early 12th century until 1337. As [[ministeriales]] of the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (State)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]], the family proved crucial in extending German control preventing further expansion of the [[Republic of Venice]] on the northernmost [[Adriatic]]. The counts of Duino included the city into a comparatively good road network, which were in operation on the routes leading towards the sea. The Fiuman ''Terra'' was their most important [[fief]], that with its possession controlled a good road network from the river [[Timavo]] to the Quarnero gulf. Along these roads, marked by several castles and outposts ([[Seno\u017ee\u010de]], [[Gotnik]] (Guettenegg) and [[Prem, Ilirska Bistrica|Prem]]) guarding the land communications from the Quarnero towards Carniola, the contemporary Slovenia.  Traders are reported from [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] [[Villach]], [[Carniola]]n [[Ljubljana]] (Laibach) and [[Lower Styria|Styrian]] [[Ptuj]] (Pettau) but also from the German lands of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn Fiume the local [[toponymy]] is predominantly Slavic [[Croats|Croatian]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Italians came from the sea, usually as craftsmen and traders, from the central Italian Adriatic ports, such as [[Fermo]], [[Ancona]], [[Senigallia]], and with [[Venice]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}. The trade of Fiume develops in linking the German lands with central Italian ports. Notably, the contacts with [[Croatia]] were very scarce given the absence of land connections of Fiume with its eastern hinterland.\n\nIn 1399, the territory fell into the hands of the German family of [[House of Walsee|Walsee]], the last of whom sold the territory to the [[Habsburgs]] in 1465. After the extinction of the house of the Walsee in 1465, the possessions were inherited by the Habsburg family that owned it from 1466 to 1776. The Habsburgs granted Fiume with the status of a free city, and included in the [[Duchy of Carniola]].\n\nAs a ''reichsfrei'' city, or territory (Fiume was a ''terra'') was under the direct authority of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], without any intermediary liege [[lord]](s). Advantages were that ''reichsfrei'' regions had the right to collect taxes and tolls themselves, and held juridical rights themselves. De facto imperial immediacy corresponded to a semi-independence with a far-reaching autonomy. In 1599 Fiume ''de facto'' becomes an independent City commune, emancipated from the Duchy of Carniola, although the Carniolan Estates continued (unsuccessfully) to claim their rights upon the city&nbsp;\u2013 right up to their cessation in 1809.\n\nThe late mediaeval Commune was ruled according to the Statute from 1530 but this charter formally lasted until 1850. The first codified Statute of Fiume preserves some features of the mediaeval Croatian statutes,{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} still with a preponderance of Italian and Venetian institutions. According to the Statute, the executive power was in the hand of the ''Gran Consiglio'' (\"Great council\") with 50 members and the ''Piccolo Consiglio'' (\"Small council\") of 25 [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]s. The Captain was the representative of the feudal lord (from 1466 the Habsburg archduke). The local executives, ''giudici rettori'' (\"justice rectors\"), have to obey only the lord&nbsp;\u2013 from 1466 the duke (later Emperor) of the House of Habsburg. Thus, in its local corporate representation Fiume was a mixture between the local self-government tradition and the ''Reichsfreiheit'' or ''[[Imperial immediacy|Reichsunmittelbarkeit]]'' of the free cities of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n== Turkish wars ==\n\nFiume by the 19th century had arisen as the most important port for the eastern half of the Habsburg empire, but its beginnings are modest: at the dawn of the modern age it was still a small port city, with less than 5000 inhabitants.\nThe Kingdom of Croatia, with whom the city bordered along the eastern shores of its river, merged with the Kingdom of Hungary, after the disaster of the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526. Both kingdoms accepted the sovereignty of the Habsburgs to defend from the Turkish conquests.  Following 1526, the stretch of territory south of Fiume and north of the Zrmanja river (called the Littoral) was held by the House of Austria&nbsp;\u2013 inheritor of the Crowns of Croatia and Hungary. Southwards, [[Venetian Dalmatia]] spread up to [[Cattaro]]. As such these lands were permanently put on a frontline, intended to bring to a halt the Ottoman advance that stopped short of the gulf of Quarnero.\n\nUntil the late 17th century, the Habsburg monarchy was essentially a landlocked territory: trade and traffic had followed the commercial routes to the North and Northwest, and [[Hamburg]] was the main port for Austrian products. When these routes became increasingly blocked by the growing Prussian state, the Monarchy started to turn towards its southern possessions. The trade of the City still languished since the Habsburgs retraced to Trieste all the Austrian exports, also because of the insecurity of land communications thorough Fiume.\n\nTurkish attacks and intrusion in Croatia and the surroundings of Fiume, were particularly frequent from 1469 to 1502, helped by the near absence of any organised defence.  The threat from the Ottoman Empire which kept the monarchy engaged in permanent military actions and in concluding coalitions with Christian allies and Venice was one of these. The northern Adriatic thus functioned as something as an Ottoman, Venetian, and Habsburg borderland's littoral.\n\nThe border itself was a very fuzzy and mobile concept in the region for centuries: the Croatian Littoral and its hinterland were an integrated part of the Habsburg Military Frontier which was more than a defensive institution and marked all the stages of societal development in the area. Its principal characteristic was that the various fortresses were manned with regular and irregular troops for a permanent low intensity warfare which included raiding as its main source of revenues. Incursions of armed bands both form the Ottoman side the irregular Hajduks and Uskoks as well as the local Military Frontier troops (Grenzer) were conducted on a daily basis.\n\nProbably no phenomenon describes the turbulent events in the area better than the rise of the Uskok's piracy and banditry in the northern Adriatic.  [[Uskoks]] served as irregulars in the Habsburg border garrison of [[Senj]] for a century. The Habsburg and the Pope celebrated their role as bulwark of Christendom, while for the Venetians (laics and priests alike) they were \"bandits and pirates worse than the Turks and responsible for innumerable atrocities\".  Fiume's history is very much that of the Uskoks for much of the 16th century. In fact the City survived as a port of trade principally thanks to afflux of the merchandise they robbed.  It was a world of precarious life and insecurity where trade degenerated into a raiding economy. Venetia, knowing that the Uskoks had Fiume as their main \"emporium\", sacked and burned the City in 1530 in a punitive expedition. Uskok piracy aroused as a serious diplomatic problem between Austria and [[Republic of Venice|Venetia]] and was settled in 1612 with the Treaty of Vienna with whom the Emperor refused any support to the Uskoks.\n\nThe repeated attempts of Habsburg emperors to expand and enlarge the tiny fishing villages of the northern Adriatic into functioning ports had previously failed because of the domination of Venice that controlled the entire Adriatic and fiercely opposed the development of the Habsburg ports. Even that did not prevent a series of Venetian occupations and destruction of Fiume, from 1508 to 1512, 1530, 1599 and, finally, in 1612. The maritime traffic was reduced to cabotage, since the [[Republic of Venice|Serenissima]] controlled all ships leaving the ports. Habsburg emperors unsuccessfully tried to break this domination of the sea, claiming free shipping for all and formulating it in treaties and diplomatic agreements.\n\nOnly with the pacification of the Turks, which seemed realisable for the first time at the end of the 17th century, could new attempts be undertaken. At the end of the 17th century the Ottomans are defeated and with the [[Treaty of Karlovitz]] (1699) the Empire regains control over the vast plains of [[Vojvodina]] and [[Banat]] promptly put under the direct control of the Imperial Chamber (Kaiserliche Hofkammer) of [[Inner Austria]] with seat in [[Graz]] as the Imperial Regency, to finance the military needs against the [[Ottomans]].\n\n== The origins of the emporium ==\n\nThe origins of the emporium are to be located in the late 17th  century when a mercantilist program starts to find its way into the Habsburg lands. Already in year 1666, under Emperor Leopold I, in Vienna a Commerzcollegium was founded, an office with the main function of initiating some economic reforms and the control of their execution. Based upon mercantilistic principles, a homogeneous \"Littoral district\" was to be created along the Adriatic coast.\n\nBesides the local and, up to that time, unimportant ports of Trieste and Fiume, the plan also encompassed the integration of Croatian territories, which had been seized from the Ottoman Empire during the second half of the 17th century: the Gulf of Bakar, Senj and [[Karlobag]] where the Habsburgs met the competition of the local powerful landlords who started to develop as ports some of the coastal towns they owned. The [[Zrinski]] (Zriny) were the most powerful landowners in Croatia and most of the land that surrounded Fiume (as well as the city of [[Bakar]] (Buccari) was in their hands. They developed the port of Buccari, the best natural harbour in the area, comparatively well connected with the hinterland. Alliance with Venice and much lower taxes explain the success of Buccari, where soon the rise in traffic vastly outnumbered that of the Habsburg port of Fiume. Buccari had a lazaretto, founded by a Venetian company. The other family were the [[Frankopan]] (Frangipane) who owned and developed the port of [[Kraljevica]] (Portor\u00e8). These developments came to an abrupt end with the [[Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy]]. After the end of the rebellion in 1673, that resulted in their defeat all these possessions were confiscated and put under the control of the [[Hungarian Aulic Chamber]], soon transferred to the Imperial Chamber of [[Inner Austria]]. The destruction of the most powerful feudal families and their economic might ensured that no similar event would take place during the feudal era.  Between Vienna and the Adriatic ports there were no feudal lords capable of competing or disturbing the plans of economic development. One of the big obstacles for the implementation of these policies was the Venetian monopoly on the Adriatic which effectively prevented ships form other countries to fare freely on this closed sea at the time known also as the \"Gulf of Venice\". Success was achieved under Charles VI. In 1717 after another victorious campaign against the Ottomans (but this time with [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] as its ally) the Adriatic sea was promptly declared free for trade, with Venice no longer opposing it; in 1718 peace was concluded with the Ottoman Empire and a commercial treaty brought important commercial liberties to the Ottoman and Habsburg subjects; in 1719 Trieste and Fiume were declared Free Ports of the Empire of the Habsburgs.\n\n[[File:GradskitoranjRijeka.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The [[Baroque]] city clock tower above the arched gateway linking the ''Korzo'' to the inner city, designed by [[Filbert Bazarig]] in 1876]]\n\nIn 1723 the \"Gran Consiglio\" of the Fiuman commune was put under the Circle of [[Inner Austria]] with the seat in [[Graz]]. The Captain as a representative of the Emperor still held the executive power for the governmental economic policy. Progressively, Fiume was included in broader institutional frameworks, aimed at economic development of the whole empire, but growingly of its Hungarian part. That Hungarian influence was on the rise is reflected also in fact that Fiume, as a Free City, accepted the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], in 1723&nbsp;\u2013 the same year as the Hungarian Diet, while the \"sister city\" of Trieste did it ten year earlier in 1713 - as the other Habsburg lands.

In 1745 she united the administrations of all the ports within an ''Oberste Commerz-Intendenza'' (High Commercial Intendancy), which was originally established by her father in 1731.\n\nFiume, instead of a Kreisamt, subordinated to the Gubernium, has a ''Direzione Superiore Commerciale'' (Kommerzassesorium) subordinated to the ''Cesarea Regia Intendenza Commerciale per il Litorale'', seated in Trieste. The Intendenza was the first provincial imperial institution that ruled the City from 1748 until 1776. In 1749 [[Maria Theresa]] issued the Haupt Resolution by which the civil and military Capitan of Trieste was put under the control of the Comercien Ober Directorium seated in Vienna. All the region of the Littoral in fact became a territorial dependency of this new institution, specifically oriented to the development of commerce and thus very different from the other (still feudal) provinces. From 1753 the ''Intendenza Capitanale di Fiume Tersatto e Buccari'', executed the orders from the head office in Trieste. The Fiuman \"Luogotenente\"  of the ''Cesarea Regia Luogotenenza Governale del Capitanato di Fiume, Tersatto e Buccari'', had also the role of the previous captain, and his jurisdiction extended from Moschienizze to Carlopago. The Intendenza transmits the orders to the Justice Rectors in Fiume. Thereby the autonomy of the local institutions (the Justice Rectors previously were at the top of the communal administration) was gradually reduced.\n\n[[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] also founded a \"privileged company\" in Fiume. The purpose of these measures was to attract foreign investments, but the first companies were controlled from the chamber in Vienna and went bankrupt.  The turn came in 1750, with the foundation of the Urban Arnold & Co. company, with the seat in [[Antwerp]]. Initially it dealt with the refinement of sugar, and the production of potash and tallow candles. It also possessed its own port basin and the number of its sugar refining plants grew from one to five. Soon, already in 1754, the Company was supplying the while monarchy with sugar that became its main traded article.  The company was bigger than anything Fiume had previously seen. It employed more than 1000 workers and employees in a time when the city had little more than 5000 inhabitants. Apart from sugar the company produced salted meat. The company bring new life to Fiuman economy and started many spin-offs (candle and rope factories, etc.). Industrial production in the city rose rapidly: in 1771 it was valued at 802,582 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]]s, in 1780 2,278,000. the value of imports in 1771 was 1,187,000 guldens, in 1780 2,781,000 guldens. Exports value in 1771 was 496,000 guldens, in 1780 1,340,000 guldens, but probably they were even higher: according to the Ragusan diplomat [[Luka Sorko\u010devi\u0107]] who in 1782 stayed in Fiume in his private diary estimated the added value of the fiuman economy (based on the value of its exported goods) at 2,5 million guldens.\n\n== Corpus Separatum ==\n{{Main|Corpus separatum (Fiume)}}\n\nDuring the 1740s most of the trade from the [[Pannonian plain]] was starting to pass over Fiume and not [[Dubrovnik]] (Ragusa), which after the retreat of the [[Ottoman Empire]], never regained the lost ground. After a series of formal acts of protest of the Hungarian and Croat Landed Estates, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] during his journey through Croatia, the Littoral and Venice in 1775, which was carried out one year later, in 1776, decided the abolition of the \u2018Litorale Austriaco\u2019. In the same year the \"Provincia Mercantile\" was suspended. In 1776, the City of Fiume and the Croatian seaboard, which had previously been under the same administration as the rest of the Austrian littoral, is annexed to the Kingdom of Croatia, with a Maria Theresa Handschrift. The Empress donated these lands and possessions to Croatia&nbsp;\u2013 Hungary as a compensation since many of their lands were put under the direct imperial administration as the osterreichische Militargrenze (Military Frontier) against the Turks, exclusively for defensive purposes.\n\n[[File:fiume-cs.jpg|thumb|right|The corpus separatum]]\n\nMaria Theresa, with her sovereign decision from October the 2nd 1776, gave up the possession of Fiume, that so far belonged to the Habsburgs, and give it to the Hungarian kingdom, with a view of fostering its trade. Since Hungary proper was distant some 500&nbsp;km, according to the act, understandably, the city was annexed to Croatia whose territory began right beyond the city walls.\nAlthough Croatia, as a kingdom, was united with Hungary and together they formed the \"Lands of the Holy Crown of St Stephen\", the Fiumani protested, and with support of the Hungarian Vice Regency Council, two and a half years later, Maria Theresa (as Queen of Hungary) enacted the royal rescript on April, the 23rd 1779, with whom Fiume was annexed to Hungary directly as a ''corpus separatum adnexum sacra hungaricae coronae''.\nFrom that moment on the two kingdoms never ceased to batter on the issue whose was Fiume. The Fiumani, as a third part, gave their reading that Fiume (or better: the corpus separatum) was autonomous from both. Given the institutional instability that characterized the whole period from 1779 up to 1848, this was more or less true.\nFiume retained the autonomous status from the surrounding territory it enjoyed with the Habsburgs, since the function of the Governor was preserved, and who was now always drawn from the ranks of the Hungarian aristocracy. Fiume was the only city in Hungary (Croatia included) that had such an institution. The development of the port needed huge investments that only Hungary could offer and the leaning of all the local forces towards Hungary appears inevitable.\n\n== The Gubernium of Fiume ==\n\nThe territory was to form the new comitatus of Severin that  also included all the confiscated possessions of the Frangipane and [[Zrinski]] families that surrounded Fiume in the interior. Trieste now became the only harbour of the German hereditary lands. Fiume became fully independent from Trieste in all-commercial, fiscal and administrative matters as the main port of Hungary, which meant excluding the city from the Holy Roman Empire, and here a ''Gubernium'' was installed too, while the other ports were annexed to Croatia.\n\nThe inclusion of Fiume into Croatia arouse a series of protests from the fiuman notables, promptly supported by the Hungarian estates. In fact already in 1776, when it was decreed to include Fiume to Hungary through Croatia, it was the count [[J\u00f3zsef Majl\u00e1th]], acting as Hungarian royal commissar, who took over the town from baron [[Giuseppe Pasquale Ricci|Pasquale Ricci]], the representative of the Intendancy from Trieste.\n\nShortly after that, (with the rescript of the queen dated 23 April 1779) the City is officially directly annexed to Hungary as a  ''[[corpus separatum (Fiume)|corpus separatum]]'') (i.e.: not as a part of Croatia, that was in a personal union with Hungary). Since Fiume had to serve a similar \"emporial\" function for Hungary as Trieste did for the Habsburg lands, the Hungarian estates (and most probably the Queen) wanted to grant the City a similar degree of institutional autonomy as that enjoyed by Trieste.\n\nAccording to the rescript from 1779, Fiume was considered to be a corpus separatum&nbsp;\u2013 that is a political body with a greater autonomy than a royal free City, or a comitatus, but a territory comparable to the other partes adnexae constituting the Crown of the St. Stephen. Its position was thus comparable to those of the regna, as Trieste was considered to be a crown land of the [[Habsburg hereditary lands]] (''Erblande'') so Fiume was considered to be a partes adnexa to the crown.\nAfter the royal rescript from 23 April 1779, the stage for all the political confrontations that will happen in Fiume was set for more than a century and a half. In a sense it can be said that all history that followed was a long footnote on how to interpret this two acts from 1776 and 1779.  The act presented a precedent for the Hungarian constitutional praxis, since it was the first time that a part of the Holy Roman Empire (and a hereditary fief of the Habsburgs) was given to the Hungarian-Croatian kingdom. Therefore, since the Croatian and Hungarian estates had widely diverging interests with respect to Fiume, they produced very different interpretations of the rescript.\n\nThe Croatians refused to accept the Hungarian reading of the document&nbsp;\u2013 they denied that the City could have been excluded from the surrounding territory, that was already framed into a [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|comitatus]]. Since the Croatian estates never accepted this interpretation, the constitutional position of the City was always somehow imprecise. On the other hand, the change happened when the Croatian diet voted for the suspension of the short-lived [[Croatian Vice-regency Council]] in Vienna  whose prerogatives were now entirely devolved to the [[Hungarian Vice-regency Council]], now the supreme administrative authority for Croatia as well.\n\nFiume becomes the administrative centre for two very different&nbsp;\u2013 and overlapping&nbsp;\u2013 administrative units: The Gubernium of Fiume and the Comitatus of Severin (Severinska \u017dupanija), that is an integral part of Croatia. Arguably the simultaneous existence of the two competing offices reflects the still unsettled dispute between the Hungarian and the Croat estates. The predictable outcome of this clash came in 1787, when Joseph II dissolved the County of Severin confirming its transitory nature and introduces a new province (instead of a constituted comitatus of nobles): The \"Hungarian Littoral\" which now extends from Fiume to Senj. And in Fiume the \"Cesareo Regio Governatorato per il Litorale in Fiume\" governs the whole new province of the \"Hungarian Littoral\" (Litorale ungarico), thereby eliminating the Croatian competencies in this stretch of land.\nFor the first time in 1790, unofficially,  the representatives of Fiume took part at the gathering of the Hungarian parliament. They claimed the annexation to Hungary, but it was postponed three times by the Habsburg monarchs in 1790, 1802, and 1805. Finally, in 1807, Fiume became legally a part of Hungary.  The Fiuman governor had a right to vote in the Chamber of Magnates of the Royal Hungarian Diet (Orszaggyules), while \"the deputies of Fiume\" (probably two, since their number was still not specified by the law) had the right to vote as members of the St\u00e4nde und Orden. Fiume become part of the Hungarian Orszag, but de facto the law was never applied.\n\n== Judicial system \u2013 Fiume (1790s) ==\nThe Gubernium of Fiume is now under the direct Hungarian administration in terms of commercial and economic policies, but still the comitatus of Zagreb retains competencies in judiciary and public education matters. But these capacities were insignificant since in Fiume higher education, initially set by the Jesuits in the 17th century, was replaced by Hungarians after the suppression of the order. On the other hand, in Fiume the judiciary competencies were retained by the local patricians, and de facto, the comitatus of Zagreb and the Croatian estates in Fiume were powerless, since the Gubernium acted as a Court of Appeal (Capitanale Consiglio e Sede Criminale) both for the commercial and civil courts in Fiume.\n\n{{chart top|width=100%|Judicial system \u2013 Fiume (1790s)}}\n{{chart/start|align=center}}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| | | BAR | BAR=[[Curia Regia]] ([[Buda]]) }}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| | | |!| | | }}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| | | BAR | BAR=[[Tabula Banalis]] Regnorum Dalmatiae, Croatiae et Slavoniae ([[Zagreb]]) }}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| | | |!| | | }}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| | | BAR | BAR=[[Capitanale Consiglio e Sede Criminale]] (at the Gubernium in Fiume) }}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| |,|-|^|-|.| }}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| FOO | | BAR  | FOO=[[C.R.

After two brief occupations in 1797 and 1805, a French government was introduced in 1809, with Fiume included in the \"Illyrian provinces\" with the seat in Ljubljana.  The City constitutes a special \"District of Fiume\" within Civil Croatia with 3 districts Karlovac, Fiume, Senj with the seat in Karlovac.<ref>Viezzoli, Giuseppe.

The British Navy imposed a blockade of the Adriatic Sea, effective since the Treaty of Tilsit (July 1807), which brought merchant shipping to a standstill, a measure most seriously affecting the economy of the Dalmatian port cities. The English with their base on the island of Lissa, soon become masters of the Adriatic.  An attempt by joint French and Italian forces to seize the British-held Dalmatian island of Vis failed on 22 October 1810. Napoleon's exclusively land-based customs enforcers could not stop British smugglers, especially as these operated with the connivance of Napoleon's chosen rulers of Spain, Westphalia and other German states, who faced severe shortages of goods from the French colonies. The embargo encouraged British merchants to aggressively seek out new markets and to engage in smuggling with continental Europe.  In Fiume [[Andrija Ljudevit Adami\u0107|Andrea Lodovico de Adamich]] emerged to become the wealthiest and most powerful merchant in Fiume.<ref>Avakumovic, Ivan. \"An Episode In The Continental System in the Illyrian Provinces\", ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 14. No 3 (Summer, 1954), pp. 254-261.</ref>\n\nIn August 1813, Austria declared war on France. Austrian troops led by General Franz Tomassich invaded the Illyrian provinces. Croat troops enrolled in the French army switched sides. The English General Nugent, serving the Austrian Empire, liberated the town from the reign of the \"Illyrian passing glory\" on 26 August 1813.<ref>Antoljak, Stjepan. \"Prekosavska Hrvatska i pitanje njene reinkorporacije (1813 - 1822)\", in Stjepan Antoljak, Stjepan. 1994.

''Metternich und die Frage Ungarns'', Akademiai Kiado, Budapest.</ref> In the Restoration 1814-1822 Fiume was put under the ephemeral \"[[Kingdom of Illyria (1816\u20131849)|Kingdom of Illyria]]\". By the end of the Austrian reign (1823), including the first Hungarian period too (1776\u20131809), Fiume hardly developed; only minor constructions were done. The number of the inhabitants shows slow increase: in 1777 the number of population was 5312, in 1819 it was 8345.\n\nFrancis I, with the order of 1 June 1822, gave back Fiume to Hungary to form the centre of the Hungarial Littoral (Littorale Hungaricum) with the by-ports of Buccari, Portor\u00e9 and Novi. The new Hungarian governor, Antal Majl\u00e1th (son of J\u00f3zsef Majl\u00e1th, the first Hungarian governor in Fiume) took over the duty on 15 October 1822. Emperor Francis, with a rescript in 1822, made autonomous the [[Circle (country subdivision)|Kreis]]e of Carlstadt and Fiume, and thereby, in November 1822, restored the Comitatus of Severin.<ref>\u017dic, Igor. ''A Short History of the City of Rijeka'', Adami\u0107, Rijeka, 2007.</ref>\n\nFiume was invited to participate also to the Croatian Diet in Zagreb, where Antun Mihanovi\u0107 then employed as a gubernial secretary was sent. In 1825&nbsp;\u2013 26 [[Antun Mihanovi\u0107]] (1796-1861)  and [[Andrija Ljudevit Adami\u0107|Andrea Lodovico Adamich]] (1766\u20131828) participated at the workings of the Hungarian Diet in Presburg.  Adamich there tried to promote a project for a Hungarian commercial company centred in Fiume circulating a memo (eszrevetelek) with scarce success. Afterwards he served as mercantile deputy of Fiume from 1827 until his death in 1828.<ref>Riccardo GIGANTE, \"Stralcio della corrispondenza di L. A. Adamich col tenente maresciallo Laval Nugent\", Fiume (XV-XVI) 1937-1938, p. 131.</ref>\n\nFiuman deputies participated also in the role of observes to the Croatian diets of 1830 and 1832. Far more important was the Hungarian diets from 1832 to 1836 that started the period of liberal reforms in Hungary. With the article XIX of the Hungarian law of 1836 the Fiuman judiciary was firmly included into the Hungarian judicial system and the local civic magistrate lost his judicial capacities transferred to a local court, the ''Giudizio Civico Distrettuale della fedelissima Citt\u00e0, Porto franco e Distretto di Fiume''.\n\nAfter the governorship of [[Ferencz \u00dcrm\u00e9nyi]] (1780 - 1858, governor from 1823 to 1837) P\u00e1l Kiss de Nemsk\u00e9r became new governor while Count Ferenc Zichy (1811\u20131900) acted as deputy governor and was to become Hungarian secretary of state for commerce in the Sz\u00e9chenyi ministry of 1848. After the death of Adamich, Cimiotti become deputy of Fiume at the royal Hungarian Diet serving in 1836 first as observer, and then taking active part in 1843/4. One of his first task as a deputy, together with Mih\u00e1ly Horhy was to draft a plan for political modernization of Fiume, preserving its autonomy within the Hungarian political system. After the inclusion of the city in the Hungarian system Cimiotti exploited the request (Torvenyjavaslat a Hajd\u00faker\u00fcletrol 1843/4) advanced by the [[Hajd\u00fa County]] (Hajd\u00fas\u00e1g) who constituted a \"warrior estate\" within Hungarian feudal society and were emancipated by [[Istv\u00e1n Bocskay]], Lord of [[Bihar]], in 1604-1606 from the jurisdiction of their lords. As  the Hajd\u00fa, [[Jassic people|J\u00e1sz]]  and  [[Cumans|Cuman]] districts were freed of feudal obligations providing military service so Fiume had to be exempted by providing maritime service for the Kingdom of Hungary. Cimiotti took also the privileges granted to the [[Gelnica|G\u00f6lnicb\u00e1nya]] (German: G\u00f6llnitz) miners who, as Bavarian settlers invited by the king of Hungary were granted special privileges.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/1130907/Giuseppe_Ludovico_Cimiotti_1810-1892_e_le_problematiche_origini_della_storiografia_fiumana |title=Giuseppe Ludovico Cimiotti (1810-1892) e le problematiche origini della storiografia fiumana |author=Klinger, William |authorlink=William Klinger |publisher='Fiume.

In order to get support for the modernization of the port, the \"Mercantile deputation\" of Fiume sent Ferenc Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r to lobby at the Pest Exchange court in 1842. In 1843 Josef Bainville a French engineer from Fiume who reproposed an older French plan, commissioned by Adamich during the Illyrian provinces. Bainville settled in Hungary and designed a plan for the city of  Szeged.\nStill in 1842 ambitious plans for advancing trade with Hungary, Wallachia and the Banat were advanced and Cimiotti managed to involve the engineer Mario A. Sanfermo who elaborated a plan to connect Fiume with the Sissek&nbsp;\u2013 Carlstadt railroad and its extension to Vukovar and thereby reach Serbia and Wallachia. The railroad Fiume&nbsp;\u2013 Vukovar, intended for Russian containment in the context of the [[Eastern Question]], was enthusiastically supported by Kossuth and the founding of a company ''Vukovar&nbsp;\u2013 Fiumana Unitae Societatis Pestano Fluminensis ad construendam semitam ferratam'' was voted by the Hungarian diet in 1848. In this way the well-known debates of Kossuth and [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] (who visited Fiume in 1844 and decided to allocate 260,000 guldens for port modernization) about how to build up the railway leading from Central Hungary to Fiume, appeared in Fiume in 1846. In the same year one of the articles of Kossuth, titled ''To the Sea Hungarians! Go to the Sea!'' was published in a periodical of the Trade Association.\n\nIn 1846 [[Vincenzo de Domini]] (1816 - 1903) become professor at the local nautical school. A Venetian patriot, close to the circles of Kossuth, he will be entrusted together with [[Gaspare Matcovich]] and [[Spiridione Gopcevich]] (1815 - 1861) with the project to turn the brick ''Implacable'' into a Hungarian man of war. The armament of the ship, commanded by de Domini, led Jela\u010di\u0107 to send an expedition and occupy Fiume on 31 August 1848 with Croat troops.\n\n== 1848-1870 ==\n{{Empty section|date=December 2009}}\n\n== Hungarian port 1870-1918 ==\n[[File:Fiume 1900.jpg|thumb|Rijeka around the year 1900|right|250px|thumb]]\n\nFollowing the creation of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Compromise of 1867]], Fiume was attached to Hungary for the third and last time in 1870. Croatia had constitutional autonomy within Hungary, but as Hungary's only international port, the city became an independent ''[[corpus separatum (Fiume)|corpus separatum]]'', governed directly from [[Budapest]] by an appointed governor. Austria's [[Trieste]] and Hungary's Fiume competed for maritime trade.\n\nFiume also had a significant naval base, and in the mid-19th century it became the site of the Austro-Hungarian Naval Academy (K.u.K. Marine-Akademie), where the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] trained its officers.\n\n[[Giovanni de Ciotta]] (Mayor from 1872 to 1896) proved to be the most authoritative local political leader. Under his leadership, an impressive phase of expansion of the city started, marked by major port development, fueled by the general expansion of international trade and the city's connection (1873) to the Hungarian and Austrian railway networks. Hungarian support proved to be crucial to the development of the port of Fiume and Ciotta was the key person in assuring it. From 1872 to 1896 (apart from a short interruption in 1884) he was the mayor of the city. Following the financial crisis of 1873, that culminated in 1875, the conservative liberal De\u00e1k Party had to face a crisis from which it survived only with a merger with the more numerous conservative Left Center of [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]]. The \"new\" Liberal Party of Hungary, was to rule Hungary (and Fiume) from 1875 to 1890, marking the golden years of Ciotta, later known as the ''Idyll''.<ref>Depoli Attilio, L\u2019unione di Fiume alla Corona ungarica ed il suo \"iter\" legislativo, ''Fiume'' Anno X, N.3-4 luglio-dicembre 1963, Pag.97.</ref>\n\nUnder his lead an impressive phase of expansion of the city started, marked by the completion of the railway Fiume&nbsp;\u2013 Budapest, the construction of the modern port and the initiation of modern industrial and commercial enterprises such as the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company \"[[Adria (disambiguation)|Adria]]\", and the Whitehead Torpedo Works. In 1866, [[Robert Whitehead]], manager of Stabilimento Tecnico Fiumano (an Austrian engineering company engaged in providing engines for the Austro-Hungarian Navy), experimented on the first [[torpedo]]. Ciotta's contribution was crucial as he financed [[Robert Whitehead]]'s efforts in producing a viable torpedo. Modern industrial and commercial enterprises such as the Papermill, situated in the Rje\u010dina canyon, producing worldwide known cigarette paper, became trademarks of the city.\n\nThe population grew from only 21,000 in 1880 to 50,000 in 1910. A lot of major civic buildings went up at that time, including the Governor's Palace designed by the Hungarian architect [[Alajos Hauszmann]]. In 1885 the sumptuous new theatre was finished modelled on that of Budapest and Vienna, costing him a political crisis in 1884 for the raising building costs. While on army service he met [[John Leard]], another fiuman of English origins. Ciotta with Leard in 1889 pushed forward the ''Piano regolatore'' the comprehensive urbanisation plan for the city. The new plan laid down the plan for a modern commercial city, destroying most of the older buildings and roads and introducing the regular planning as it was done in Budapest and other cities of the time. In 1891 the ''Acquedotto Ciotta'' was finished providing the city with modern sewage and water supply system. He was also a founder of several philanthropic initiatives and institutions.\n\nThe \"system  Ciotta\" underwent crisis in 1896 when Hungarian Prime Minister [[Dezs\u0151 B\u00e1nffy]] started a centralizing policy towards Fiume.  Ciotta, being unable to assure the equilibrium between Fiume and Hungary, resigned and retired to private life, following the Governor [[Lajos gr\u00f3f Batthy\u00e1ny de Nemetujv\u00e1r]]. As a response [[Michele Maylender]], backed by [[Luigi Ossoinack]] (initiator of the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company \"Adria\"), founded a new party, the [[Autonomist Association]], ending the rule of the Liberal Party of Hungary in Fiume.\n\nThe future mayor of [[New York City]], [[Fiorello La Guardia]], lived in the city at the turn of the 20th century, and reportedly even played [[football (soccer)|football]] for the local sports club.\n\n== The Italo-Yugoslav dispute and the Free State ==<!-- This section is linked from\n[[Porco Rosso]] -->\n{{Main|Italian Regency of Carnaro |Free State of Fiume}}\n[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|left|Residents of [[Fiume]] cheering D'Annunzio and his ''Legionari'', September 1919.

Croats made up most of the remainder and were also a majority in the surrounding area, including the neighbouring town of [[Su\u0161ak, Rijeka|Su\u0161ak]].<ref>Anonymous, 1919.

Negotiations over the future of the city were interrupted two days later when a force of Italian nationalist irregulars led by the poet [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] seized control of the city by force; d'Annunzio eventually established a state, the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]].<ref>Ledeen, Michael A. 1977.

On 12 November, Italy and Yugoslavia concluded the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]], under which Rijeka was to be an independent state, the [[Free State of Fiume]], under a regime acceptable to both.<ref>Federzoni, Luigi.

Italian troops took over in January 1921. The election of an autonomist-led [[Constituent Assembly|constituent assembly]] for the territory did not put an end to strife: a brief Italian nationalist seizure of power was ended by the intervention of an Italian royal commissioner, and a short-lived local Fascist takeover in March 1922 ended in a third Italian military occupation. Seven months later Italy herself fell under Fascist rule.\n\n== Fiume under Fascist rule ==\n\nA period of diplomatic acrimony closed with the [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Treaty of Rome]] (27 January 1924), which assigned Fiume to Italy and Su\u0161ak to Yugoslavia, with joint port administration.<ref>Benedetti, Giulio.

Because of its industries (oil refinery, torpedo factory, shipyards) and its port facilities, the city was a target of frequent Anglo-American air attacks. Some of the worst attacks happened on 12 January 1944  (attack on the refinery, part of the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|Oil Campaign]]) [http://www.b17pbemgame.com/317th_bomb_squadron_roster.htm], on 3\u20136 November 1944, when a series of attacks resulted in at least 125 deaths and between 15 and 25 February 1945 (200 dead, 300 wounded).<ref>KAKO JE POTOPLJEN KIEBITZ?, Slavko Suzi\u0107, Susacka Revija 54/55, 2007, see [http://www.klub-susacana.hr/revija/clanak.asp?Num=54-55&C=8] (in Croatian)</ref>  The harbour area was destroyed by retreating German troops at the very end of the war. Yugoslav troops entered the city on 3 May 1945, after heavy fighting.\n\n== Post World War II expulsion of Italians ==\n{{Main| Istrian exodus}}\nThe aftermath of the war saw the city's fate once again resolved by a combination of force and diplomacy. This time, Yugoslav troops advanced (early May 1945) as far west as [[Trieste]] in their campaign against the German occupiers of both countries. The city of Rijeka thus became Croatian (i.e., Yugoslav), a situation formalised by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaty]] between Italy and the wartime Allies on 10 February 1947. Once the change in sovereignty was formalised, 58,000 of the 66,000 Italian-speakers were more or less hastily pushed through various means out of the city (known in Italian as ''esuli'' or the exiled ones). The discrimination and persecution many of them experienced at the hands of the Yugoslav officials in the last days of World War II and the first 9 years of peace remained painful memories. Summary executions of alleged fascists (that at times were proven anti-fascists), Italian public servants, military officials and even normal civilians, limited acts of terrorism, imprisonment and loss of work and public positions forced most ethnic Italians to abandon Rijeka in order to avoid further violence. The [[Free_Territory_of_Trieste#Dissolution|Trieste crisis]] in 1954 gave the final pretext to Yugoslav authorities to strip the local Italian-speaking populace of most of its rights (but most were being lost in the years building up to 1954) and enact a more radical and successful assimilation of the previous Italian majority into the new Yugoslav majority.\n\n== In Yugoslavia ==\nBecause of its importance for the country's shipbuilding industry was from 1947 under the responsibility of the Ministry of National Defence until 1954.  In 1948 the main shipyard, renamed Maj 3, which was to serve as a base for the restored shipbuilding industry. In 1949, it launched the first post-war Yugoslav ship, the [[MB Zagreb]] of 4000 DWT. Along with the shipbuilding industry would develop one for marine equipment. After being rebuilt, the Torpedo Factory started to produce diesel engines. The former foundry Skull now Svjetlost was devoted to the production of electrical navigation equipment, while the Rikard Ben\u010di\u0107 manufactured watercraft and other auxiliary equipment. The oil refinery was back in 1948 pre-war production with 110,000 tonnes in the early Fifties it was able to process 200,000 tonnes of oil. At the time, it was supplying 37.6% of the country.\n\nDuring the period 1960-1990 Rijeka is a city that aspires to the greatest achievements and equips a heavy industry while dreaming of an Utopian tomorrow.\nAfter Edo Jardas, the following mayors followed: Franjo \u0160irola (1959\u20131964), Nikola Pavleti\u0107 (1964\u20131968), and Dragutin Haramija (1968\u20131969), Neda Andri\u0107 (1969\u20131974), Nikola Pavleti\u0107 for the second time (1974\u20131979), [[Vilim Mulc]] (1979\u20131982), Josip \u0160tefan (1982\u20131984), Zdravko Sar\u0161on (1985\u20131987) and \u017deljko Lu\u017eavec (1988\u20131993). The majority of mayors came from small towns in the immediate surroundings of the city.\n\nRegarding the economic situation, the traffic of the port complex had increased from 420,000 tons in 1946 to more than 20,000,000 tons in 1980. The port was involved in more than 50% of traffic across the country and about 80% in terms of transit. In 1980, Rijeka handled 20% of exports from Croatia and 10% of those of [[Yugoslavia]]. In 1980, when the merchant navy was at its peak, Rijeka shipping had a cargo capacity of 500,000 tons. [[Jugolinija]] was the largest shipping company of the state while [[Jadrolinija]] dealt with 49 ships and passenger transportation service by ferry-boats. Approximately 23,000 people were employed in industry in that year. Over 80% of the total industrial production was produced by the energy sector (electric power industry, oil processing and coal), as well as shipbuilding. This feature coupled with the low number of finished products explains why industry of Rijeka collapsed in the early Nineties. In 1982 there were 92,489 employees from a population of 193,000. The oil refinery treated 8,000,000 tonnes - 28% of the total state turnover. The plant had been based in Urinj since 1966. In the Eighties the construction of a petrochemical complex in [[Omi\u0161alj]] began, which later made one of the biggest losses for the state. The 3 May shipyard handled about one third of the shipbuilding industry. The peak in production was achieved between 1971 and 1975, when 32 ships were built, totalling more than 1,200,000 gross tons. These vessels were mainly for export. In the Eighties smaller boats were built and production increased to employ 7,000 shipyard workers and become the largest company in Rijeka. At the same time the shipyard [[Viktor Lenac]] in [[Martin\u0161\u010dica]] developed to become the largest repairs yard in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe development of the metalworking industry was linked to the needs of shipbuilding. Thus Vulkan manufactured cranes for the Rikard Ben\u010di\u0107 ship pumps, Torpedo manufactured diesel engines and tractors, Rade Kon\u010dar built electric generators while Metalografi\u010dki Kombinat was directed towards the production of metal packaging for the purposes of refinery. Civil engineering was expanding to the point that cooperatives such as Primorje, Jadran, Kvarner and Konstruktor employed some 10,000 workers overall in 1981. More than 6,000 of them were engaged in commerce with Brodokomerc. This was reflected in the construction of many new residential buildings in the city such as the five buildings in \u0160kurinje, all 26 floors in height.\n\nThe GHETALDUS building on Korzo, designed by Zdenko Kolacio (1949), opens the period of modern architecture. Josip Uhlik designed the building of Social Insurance. Igor Emili created designs for U\u017ear\u0161ka (1959) and \u0160porerova (1968) streets, the department store Varteks (1975), the Ri-Adria bank (later Jugobanka, 1986) in the old part of the city, and also for the buildings Kra\u0161 (1964) and Brodomaterijal II (1970) on the Korzo. Ada Felice-Ro\u0161i\u0107 designed the store Korzo (1972) with a front flanking a successful access to the old part of town while Ninoslav and Vjera Ku\u010dan designed the department store RI (1974). A series of business buildings are the work of Vladimir Grube\u0161i\u0107: Jadroagent (1977\u20131984), Delta (1983\u20131984), Privredna banka Zagreb (1986), Jadrosped, all located in the old part of town, as well as the Croatia Lines (1982\u20131992). One of the most accomplished achievements was the construction of the Rije\u010dka banka, according to a draft Kazimir O\u0161trogovi\u0107 (1966). The project of the Museum of the Revolution (now the Municipal Museum) was designed by Neven \u0160egvi\u0107 (1976), and the office tower at HPT-Centar Kozala was designed by N. Ku\u010dan and V. Antolovi\u0107 (1975). The architect Boris Maga\u0161 is the author of two major buildings: the Faculty of Law (1980 with Olga Maga\u0161), and the Church of St. Nicholas (1981\u20131988).\n\n== In independent Croatia ==\n{{Empty section|date=December 2009}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Corpus separatum (Fiume)]]\n*[[Postage stamps and postal history of Fiume]]\n*[[List of governors and heads of state of Fiume]]\n* [[Names of European cities in different languages: Q\u2013T#R|Other names of Rijeka]]\n* [[Timeline of Rijeka history]]\n*[[Imperial Estate]]\n*[[Free Imperial City]]\n*[[List of states of the Holy Roman Empire]]\n*[[History of Croatia]]\n*[[History of Slovenia]]\n*[[History of Austria]]\n*[[History of Hungary]]\n\n== References ==\n{{refimprove|date=April 2015}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{see also|Timeline of Rijeka#Bibliography}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|History of Rijeka}}\n* Europeana.

It was part of the Roman province of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], and later of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925&ndash;1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]]. It grew during the 12th to 14th centuries as a seaport within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], trading with Italian cities. Under the ownership of the [[House of Habsburg]] from 1466, it was made a free city, and although part of the [[Duchy of Carniola]] it developed organs of local self-government. \n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries Rijeka came under attack from both [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] forces, and became a base for irregular Habsburg troops known as [[Uskoks]]. Its maritime trade was suppressed by Venice until the late 17th century, when peace was concluded and the Habsburgs set about developing the city as a major port. [[Sugar refinery|Sugar refineries]] and other industries were also introduced. Rijeka was attached to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1779, retaining autonomous status, although the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] also maintained a claim. \n\nRijeka was occupied by [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] between 1809 and 1813 as part of the [[Illyrian Provinces]]. After reconquest by Austria, it was placed within the [[Kingdom of Illyria (1816\u201349)|Kingdom of Illyria]] until 1822 and then restored to Hungary. Industrial development recommenced, the port was modernised and a naval base created, and railways were constructed connecting the city with Hungary and Serbia. On the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Hungary]] gained equal status with Austria, and Rijeka, as Hungary's main port, became a rival to Austria's port of [[Trieste]]. Under the leadership of [[Giovanni de Ciotta]] the city was extensively rebuilt during the late 19th century. Resulting from further industrial expansion and immigration, Italians became the largest single group in the city.\n\nOn the defeat and [[Austria-Hungary#Dissolution|dissolution]] of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918, Italy and the new [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) both laid claim to Rijeka. Negotiations in 1919 at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] were pre-empted by the ''coup'' led by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], setting up the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]] based in the city. This was suppressed by Italian troops the next year, and under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]] the independent [[Free State of Fiume]] was established. However, after [[Benito Mussolini]] became ruler in Italy, Rijeka (as Fiume) was annexed to Italy in 1924.\n\nRijeka was occupied by German troops in 1943 after Italy [[Armistice of Cassibile|came to terms]] with the [[Allies of World War II]], and experienced extensive damage from Allied bombing. After fierce fighting it was captured on 3 May 1945 by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] forces and annexed to the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] under the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaty of 1947]]. Most of the Italian population fled or were removed, and were subsequently replaced by incomers from other parts of Yugoslavia. Rijeka became the largest port in Yugoslavia, and other growth sectors included port traffic, oil and coal. On the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, Rijeka became part of independent [[Croatia]], but has experienced economic difficulties with the closure of many of its older industries. \n\n== Origins ==\nThe region of [[Kvarner Gulf|Quarnero]] (Fiume was still not mentioned) fell within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], with the acquisition of the titles of Margraves of [[Istria]] and Dukes of [[Merania]] by the [[Andechs]] family. The possession was called Merania ({{lang-de|meer}}&nbsp;\u2013 \"sea\") meaning \"littoral\" ({{lang-de|K\u00fcstenland}}).\n\nThe counts of [[Duino]] (Tibein), were the first feudal lords of Fiume, from the early 12th century until 1337. As [[ministeriales]] of the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (State)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]], the family proved crucial in extending German control preventing further expansion of the [[Republic of Venice]] on the northernmost [[Adriatic]]. The counts of Duino included the city into a comparatively good road network, which were in operation on the routes leading towards the sea. The Fiuman ''Terra'' was their most important [[fief]], that with its possession controlled a good road network from the river [[Timavo]] to the Quarnero gulf. Along these roads, marked by several castles and outposts ([[Seno\u017ee\u010de]], [[Gotnik]] (Guettenegg) and [[Prem, Ilirska Bistrica|Prem]]) guarding the land communications from the Quarnero towards Carniola, the contemporary Slovenia.  Traders are reported from [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] [[Villach]], [[Carniola]]n [[Ljubljana]] (Laibach) and [[Lower Styria|Styrian]] [[Ptuj]] (Pettau) but also from the German lands of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn Fiume the local [[toponymy]] is predominantly Slavic [[Croats|Croatian]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Italians came from the sea, usually as craftsmen and traders, from the central Italian Adriatic ports, such as [[Fermo]], [[Ancona]], [[Senigallia]], and with [[Venice]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}. The trade of Fiume develops in linking the German lands with central Italian ports. Notably, the contacts with [[Croatia]] were very scarce given the absence of land connections of Fiume with its eastern hinterland.\n\nIn 1399, the territory fell into the hands of the German family of [[House of Walsee|Walsee]], the last of whom sold the territory to the [[Habsburgs]] in 1465. After the extinction of the house of the Walsee in 1465, the possessions were inherited by the Habsburg family that owned it from 1466 to 1776. The Habsburgs granted Fiume with the status of a free city, and included in the [[Duchy of Carniola]].\n\nAs a ''reichsfrei'' city, or territory (Fiume was a ''terra'') was under the direct authority of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], without any intermediary liege [[lord]](s). Advantages were that ''reichsfrei'' regions had the right to collect taxes and tolls themselves, and held juridical rights themselves. De facto imperial immediacy corresponded to a semi-independence with a far-reaching autonomy. In 1599 Fiume ''de facto'' becomes an independent City commune, emancipated from the Duchy of Carniola, although the Carniolan Estates continued (unsuccessfully) to claim their rights upon the city&nbsp;\u2013 right up to their cessation in 1809.\n\nThe late mediaeval Commune was ruled according to the Statute from 1530 but this charter formally lasted until 1850. The first codified Statute of Fiume preserves some features of the mediaeval Croatian statutes,{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} still with a preponderance of Italian and Venetian institutions. According to the Statute, the executive power was in the hand of the ''Gran Consiglio'' (\"Great council\") with 50 members and the ''Piccolo Consiglio'' (\"Small council\") of 25 [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]s. The Captain was the representative of the feudal lord (from 1466 the Habsburg archduke). The local executives, ''giudici rettori'' (\"justice rectors\"), have to obey only the lord&nbsp;\u2013 from 1466 the duke (later Emperor) of the House of Habsburg. Thus, in its local corporate representation Fiume was a mixture between the local self-government tradition and the ''Reichsfreiheit'' or ''[[Imperial immediacy|Reichsunmittelbarkeit]]'' of the free cities of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n== Turkish wars ==\n\nFiume by the 19th century had arisen as the most important port for the eastern half of the Habsburg empire, but its beginnings are modest: at the dawn of the modern age it was still a small port city, with less than 5000 inhabitants.\nThe Kingdom of Croatia, with whom the city bordered along the eastern shores of its river, merged with the Kingdom of Hungary, after the disaster of the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526. Both kingdoms accepted the sovereignty of the Habsburgs to defend from the Turkish conquests.  Following 1526, the stretch of territory south of Fiume and north of the Zrmanja river (called the Littoral) was held by the House of Austria&nbsp;\u2013 inheritor of the Crowns of Croatia and Hungary. Southwards, [[Venetian Dalmatia]] spread up to [[Cattaro]]. As such these lands were permanently put on a frontline, intended to bring to a halt the Ottoman advance that stopped short of the gulf of Quarnero.\n\nUntil the late 17th century, the Habsburg monarchy was essentially a landlocked territory: trade and traffic had followed the commercial routes to the North and Northwest, and [[Hamburg]] was the main port for Austrian products. When these routes became increasingly blocked by the growing Prussian state, the Monarchy started to turn towards its southern possessions. The trade of the City still languished since the Habsburgs retraced to Trieste all the Austrian exports, also because of the insecurity of land communications thorough Fiume.\n\nTurkish attacks and intrusion in Croatia and the surroundings of Fiume, were particularly frequent from 1469 to 1502, helped by the near absence of any organised defence.  The threat from the Ottoman Empire which kept the monarchy engaged in permanent military actions and in concluding coalitions with Christian allies and Venice was one of these. The northern Adriatic thus functioned as something as an Ottoman, Venetian, and Habsburg borderland\u2019s littoral.\n\nThe border itself was a very fuzzy and mobile concept in the region for centuries: the Croatian Littoral and its hinterland were an integrated part of the Habsburg Military Frontier which was more than a defensive institution and marked all the stages of societal development in the area. Its principal characteristic was that the various fortresses were manned with regular and irregular troops for a permanent low intensity warfare which included raiding as its main source of revenues. Incursions of armed bands both form the Ottoman side the irregular Hajduks and Uskoks as well as the local Military Frontier troops (Grenzer) were conducted on a daily basis.\n\nProbably no phenomenon describes the turbulent events in the area better than the rise of the Uskok\u2019s piracy and banditry in the northern Adriatic.  [[Uskoks]] served as irregulars in the Habsburg border garrison of [[Senj]] for a century. The Habsburg and the Pope celebrated their role as bulwark of Christendom, while for the Venetians (laics and priests alike) they were \"bandits and pirates worse than the Turks and responsible for innumerable atrocities\".  Fiume\u2019s history is very much that of the Uskoks for much of the 16th century. In fact the City survived as a port of trade principally thanks to afflux of the merchandise they robbed.  It was a world of precarious life and insecurity where trade degenerated into a raiding economy. Venetia, knowing that the Uskoks had Fiume as their main \"emporium\", sacked and burned the City in 1530 in a punitive expedition. Uskok piracy aroused as a serious diplomatic problem between Austria and [[Republic of Venice|Venetia]] and was settled in 1612 with the Treaty of Vienna with whom the Emperor refused any support to the Uskoks.\n\nThe repeated attempts of Habsburg emperors to expand and enlarge the tiny fishing villages of the northern Adriatic into functioning ports had previously failed because of the domination of Venice that controlled the entire Adriatic and fiercely opposed the development of the Habsburg ports. Even that did not prevent a series of Venetian occupations and destruction of Fiume, from 1508 to 1512, 1530, 1599 and, finally, in 1612. The maritime traffic was reduced to cabotage, since the [[Republic of Venice|Serenissima]] controlled all ships leaving the ports. Habsburg emperors unsuccessfully tried to break this domination of the sea, claiming free shipping for all and formulating it in treaties and diplomatic agreements.\n\nOnly with the pacification of the Turks, which seemed realisable for the first time at the end of the 17th century, could new attempts be undertaken. At the end of the 17th century the Ottomans are defeated and with the [[Treaty of Karlovitz]] (1699) the Empire regains control over the vast plains of [[Vojvodina]] and [[Banat]] promptly put under the direct control of the Imperial Chamber (Kaiserliche Hofkammer) of [[Inner Austria]] with seat in [[Graz]] as the Imperial Regency, to finance the military needs against the [[Ottomans]].\n\n== The origins of the emporium ==\n\nThe origins of the emporium are to be located in the late 17th  century when a mercantilist program starts to find its way into the Habsburg lands. Already in year 1666, under Emperor Leopold I, in Vienna a Commerzcollegium was founded, an office with the main function of initiating some economic reforms and the control of their execution. Based upon mercantilistic principles, a homogeneous \"Littoral district\" was to be created along the Adriatic coast.\n\nBesides the local and, up to that time, unimportant ports of Trieste and Fiume, the plan also encompassed the integration of Croatian territories, which had been seized from the Ottoman Empire during the second half of the 17th century: the Gulf of Bakar, Senj and [[Karlobag]] where the Habsburgs met the competition of the local powerful landlords who started to develop as ports some of the coastal towns they owned. The [[Zrinski]] (Zriny) were the most powerful landowners in Croatia and most of the land that surrounded Fiume (as well as the city of [[Bakar]] (Buccari) was in their hands. They developed the port of Buccari, the best natural harbour in the area, comparatively well connected with the hinterland. Alliance with Venice and much lower taxes explain the success of Buccari, where soon the rise in traffic vastly outnumbered that of the Habsburg port of Fiume. Buccari had a lazaretto, founded by a Venetian company. The other family were the [[Frankopan]] (Frangipane) who owned and developed the port of [[Kraljevica]] (Portor\u00e8). These developments came to an abrupt end with the [[Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy]]. After the end of the rebellion in 1673, that resulted in their defeat all these possessions were confiscated and put under the control of the [[Hungarian Aulic Chamber]], soon transferred to the Imperial Chamber of [[Inner Austria]]. The destruction of the most powerful feudal families and their economic might ensured that no similar event would take place during the feudal era.  Between Vienna and the Adriatic ports there were no feudal lords capable of competing or disturbing the plans of economic development. One of the big obstacles for the implementation of these policies was the Venetian monopoly on the Adriatic which effectively prevented ships form other countries to fare freely on this closed sea at the time known also as the \"Gulf of Venice\". Success was achieved under Charles VI. In 1717 after another victorious campaign against the Ottomans (but this time with [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] as its ally) the Adriatic sea was promptly declared free for trade, with Venice no longer opposing it; in 1718 peace was concluded with the Ottoman Empire and a commercial treaty brought important commercial liberties to the Ottoman and Habsburg subjects; in 1719 Trieste and Fiume were declared Free Ports of the Empire of the Habsburgs.\n\n[[File:GradskitoranjRijeka.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The [[Baroque]] city clock tower above the arched gateway linking the ''Korzo'' to the inner city, designed by [[Filbert Bazarig]] in 1876]]\n\nIn 1723 the \"Gran Consiglio\" of the Fiuman commune was put under the Circle of [[Inner Austria]] with the seat in [[Graz]]. The Captain as a representative of the Emperor still held the executive power for the governmental economic policy. Progressively, Fiume was included in broader institutional frameworks, aimed at economic development of the whole empire, but growingly of its Hungarian part. That Hungarian influence was on the rise is reflected also in fact that Fiume, as a Free City, accepted the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], in 1723&nbsp;\u2013 the same year as the Hungarian Diet, while the \"sister city\" of Trieste did it ten year earlier in 1713 - as the other Habsburg lands.

In 1745 she united the administrations of all the ports within an ''Oberste Commerz-Intendenza'' (High Commercial Intendancy), which was originally established by her father in 1731.\n\nFiume, instead of a Kreisamt, subordinated to the Gubernium, has a ''Direzione Superiore Commerciale'' (Kommerzassesorium) subordinated to the ''Cesarea Regia Intendenza Commerciale per il Litorale'', seated in Trieste. The Intendenza was the first provincial imperial institution that ruled the City from 1748 until 1776. In 1749 [[Maria Theresa]] issued the Haupt Resolution by which the civil and military Capitan of Trieste was put under the control of the Comercien Ober Directorium seated in Vienna. All the region of the Littoral in fact became a territorial dependency of this new institution, specifically oriented to the development of commerce and thus very different from the other (still feudal) provinces. From 1753 the ''Intendenza Capitanale di Fiume Tersatto e Buccari'', executed the orders from the head office in Trieste. The Fiuman \"Luogotenente\"  of the ''Cesarea Regia Luogotenenza Governale del Capitanato di Fiume, Tersatto e Buccari'', had also the role of the previous captain, and his jurisdiction extended from Moschienizze to Carlopago. The Intendenza transmits the orders to the Justice Rectors in Fiume. Thereby the autonomy of the local institutions (the Justice Rectors previously were at the top of the communal administration) was gradually reduced.\n\n[[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] also founded a \"privileged company\" in Fiume. The purpose of these measures was to attract foreign investments, but the first companies were controlled from the chamber in Vienna and went bankrupt.  The turn came in 1750, with the foundation of the Urban Arnold & Co. company, with the seat in [[Antwerp]]. Initially it dealt with the refinement of sugar, and the production of potash and tallow candles. It also possessed its own port basin and the number of its sugar refining plants grew from one to five. Soon, already in 1754, the Company was supplying the while monarchy with sugar that became its main traded article.  The company was bigger than anything Fiume had previously seen. It employed more than 1000 workers and employees in a time when the city had little more than 5000 inhabitants. Apart from sugar the company produced salted meat. The company bring new life to Fiuman economy and started many spin-offs (candle and rope factories, etc.). Industrial production in the city rose rapidly: in 1771 it was valued at 802,582 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]]s, in 1780 2,278,000. the value of imports in 1771 was 1,187,000 guldens, in 1780 2,781,000 guldens. Exports value in 1771 was 496,000 guldens, in 1780 1,340,000 guldens, but probably they were even higher: according to the Ragusan diplomat [[Luka Sorko\u010devi\u0107]] who in 1782 stayed in Fiume in his private diary estimated the added value of the fiuman economy (based on the value of its exported goods) at 2,5 million guldens.\n\n== Corpus Separatum ==\n{{Main|Corpus separatum (Fiume)}}\n\nDuring the 1740s most of the trade from the [[Pannonian plain]] was starting to pass over Fiume and not [[Dubrovnik]] (Ragusa), which after the retreat of the [[Ottoman Empire]], never regained the lost ground. After a series of formal acts of protest of the Hungarian and Croat Landed Estates, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] during his journey through Croatia, the Littoral and Venice in 1775, which was carried out one year later, in 1776, decided the abolition of the \u2018Litorale Austriaco\u2019. In the same year the \"Provincia Mercantile\" was suspended. In 1776, the City of Fiume and the Croatian seaboard, which had previously been under the same administration as the rest of the Austrian littoral, is annexed to the Kingdom of Croatia, with a Maria Theresa Handschrift. The Empress donated these lands and possessions to Croatia&nbsp;\u2013 Hungary as a compensation since many of their lands were put under the direct imperial administration as the osterreichische Militargrenze (Military Frontier) against the Turks, exclusively for defensive purposes.\n\n[[File:fiume-cs.jpg|thumb|right|The corpus separatum]]\n\nMaria Theresa, with her sovereign decision from October the 2nd 1776, gave up the possession of Fiume, that so far belonged to the Habsburgs, and give it to the Hungarian kingdom, with a view of fostering its trade. Since Hungary proper was distant some 500&nbsp;km, according to the act, understandably, the city was annexed to Croatia whose territory began right beyond the city walls.\nAlthough Croatia, as a kingdom, was united with Hungary and together they formed the \"Lands of the Holy Crown of St Stephen\", the Fiumani protested, and with support of the Hungarian Vice Regency Council, two and a half years later, Maria Theresa (as Queen of Hungary) enacted the royal rescript on April, the 23rd 1779, with whom Fiume was annexed to Hungary directly as a ''corpus separatum adnexum sacra hungaricae coronae''.\nFrom that moment on the two kingdoms never ceased to batter on the issue whose was Fiume. The Fiumani, as a third part, gave their reading that Fiume (or better: the corpus separatum) was autonomous from both. Given the institutional instability that characterized the whole period from 1779 up to 1848, this was more or less true.\nFiume retained the autonomous status from the surrounding territory it enjoyed with the Habsburgs, since the function of the Governor was preserved, and who was now always drawn from the ranks of the Hungarian aristocracy. Fiume was the only city in Hungary (Croatia included) that had such an institution. The development of the port needed huge investments that only Hungary could offer and the leaning of all the local forces towards Hungary appears inevitable.\n\n== The Gubernium of Fiume ==\n\nThe territory was to form the new comitatus of Severin that  also included all the confiscated possessions of the Frangipane and [[Zrinski]] families that surrounded Fiume in the interior. Trieste now became the only harbour of the German hereditary lands. Fiume became fully independent from Trieste in all-commercial, fiscal and administrative matters as the main port of Hungary, which meant excluding the city from the Holy Roman Empire, and here a ''Gubernium'' was installed too, while the other ports were annexed to Croatia.\n\nThe inclusion of Fiume into Croatia arouse a series of protests from the fiuman notables, promptly supported by the Hungarian estates. In fact already in 1776, when it was decreed to include Fiume to Hungary through Croatia, it was the count [[J\u00f3zsef Majl\u00e1th]], acting as Hungarian royal commissar, who took over the town from baron [[Giuseppe Pasquale Ricci|Pasquale Ricci]], the representative of the Intendancy from Trieste.\n\nShortly after that, (with the rescript of the queen dated 23 April 1779) the City is officially directly annexed to Hungary as a  ''[[corpus separatum (Fiume)|corpus separatum]]'') (i.e.: not as a part of Croatia, that was in a personal union with Hungary). Since Fiume had to serve a similar \"emporial\" function for Hungary as Trieste did for the Habsburg lands, the Hungarian estates (and most probably the Queen) wanted to grant the City a similar degree of institutional autonomy as that enjoyed by Trieste.\n\nAccording to the rescript from 1779, Fiume was considered to be a corpus separatum&nbsp;\u2013 that is a political body with a greater autonomy than a royal free City, or a comitatus, but a territory comparable to the other partes adnexae constituting the Crown of the St. Stephen. Its position was thus comparable to those of the regna, as Trieste was considered to be a crown land of the [[Habsburg hereditary lands]] (''Erblande'') so Fiume was considered to be a partes adnexa to the crown.\nAfter the royal rescript from 23 April 1779, the stage for all the political confrontations that will happen in Fiume was set for more than a century and a half. In a sense it can be said that all history that followed was a long footnote on how to interpret this two acts from 1776 and 1779.  The act presented a precedent for the Hungarian constitutional praxis, since it was the first time that a part of the Holy Roman Empire (and a hereditary fief of the Habsburgs) was given to the Hungarian-Croatian kingdom. Therefore, since the Croatian and Hungarian estates had widely diverging interests with respect to Fiume, they produced very different interpretations of the rescript.\n\nThe Croatians refused to accept the Hungarian reading of the document&nbsp;\u2013 they denied that the City could have been excluded from the surrounding territory, that was already framed into a [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|comitatus]]. Since the Croatian estates never accepted this interpretation, the constitutional position of the City was always somehow imprecise. On the other hand, the change happened when the Croatian diet voted for the suspension of the short-lived [[Croatian Vice-regency Council]] in Vienna  whose prerogatives were now entirely devolved to the [[Hungarian Vice-regency Council]], now the supreme administrative authority for Croatia as well.\n\nFiume becomes the administrative centre for two very different&nbsp;\u2013 and overlapping&nbsp;\u2013 administrative units: The Gubernium of Fiume and the Comitatus of Severin (Severinska \u017dupanija), that is an integral part of Croatia. Arguably the simultaneous existence of the two competing offices reflects the still unsettled dispute between the Hungarian and the Croat estates. The predictable outcome of this clash came in 1787, when Joseph II dissolved the County of Severin confirming its transitory nature and introduces a new province (instead of a constituted comitatus of nobles): The \"Hungarian Littoral\" which now extends from Fiume to Senj. And in Fiume the \"Cesareo Regio Governatorato per il Litorale in Fiume\" governs the whole new province of the \"Hungarian Littoral\" (Litorale ungarico), thereby eliminating the Croatian competencies in this stretch of land.\nFor the first time in 1790, unofficially,  the representatives of Fiume took part at the gathering of the Hungarian parliament. They claimed the annexation to Hungary, but it was postponed three times by the Habsburg monarchs in 1790, 1802, and 1805. Finally, in 1807, Fiume became legally a part of Hungary.  The Fiuman governor had a right to vote in the Chamber of Magnates of the Royal Hungarian Diet (Orszaggyules), while \"the deputies of Fiume\" (probably two, since their number was still not specified by the law) had the right to vote as members of the St\u00e4nde und Orden. Fiume become part of the Hungarian Orszag, but de facto the law was never applied.\n\n== Judicial system \u2013 Fiume (1790s) ==\nThe Gubernium of Fiume is now under the direct Hungarian administration in terms of commercial and economic policies, but still the comitatus of Zagreb retains competencies in judiciary and public education matters. But these capacities were insignificant since in Fiume higher education, initially set by the Jesuits in the 17th century, was replaced by Hungarians after the suppression of the order. On the other hand, in Fiume the judiciary competencies were retained by the local patricians, and de facto, the comitatus of Zagreb and the Croatian estates in Fiume were powerless, since the Gubernium acted as a Court of Appeal (Capitanale Consiglio e Sede Criminale) both for the commercial and civil courts in Fiume.\n\n{{chart top|width=100%|Judicial system \u2013 Fiume (1790s)}}\n{{chart/start|align=center}}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| | | BAR | BAR=[[Curia Regia]] ([[Buda]]) }}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| | | |!| | | }}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| | | BAR | BAR=[[Tabula Banalis]] Regnorum Dalmatiae, Croatiae et Slavoniae ([[Zagreb]]) }}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| | | |!| | | }}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| | | BAR | BAR=[[Capitanale Consiglio e Sede Criminale]] (at the Gubernium in Fiume) }}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| |,|-|^|-|.| }}\n{{chart|border=0|boxstyle=background:#dfd;| FOO | | BAR  | FOO=[[C.R.

After two brief occupations in 1797 and 1805, a French government was introduced in 1809, with Fiume included in the \"Illyrian provinces\" with the seat in Ljubljana.  The City constitutes a special \"District of Fiume\" within Civil Croatia with 3 districts Karlovac, Fiume, Senj with the seat in Karlovac.<ref>Viezzoli, Giuseppe.

The British Navy imposed a blockade of the Adriatic Sea, effective since the Treaty of Tilsit (July 1807), which brought merchant shipping to a standstill, a measure most seriously affecting the economy of the Dalmatian port cities. The English with their base on the island of Lissa, soon become masters of the Adriatic.  An attempt by joint French and Italian forces to seize the British-held Dalmatian island of Vis failed on 22 October 1810. Napoleon's exclusively land-based customs enforcers could not stop British smugglers, especially as these operated with the connivance of Napoleon's chosen rulers of Spain, Westphalia and other German states, who faced severe shortages of goods from the French colonies. The embargo encouraged British merchants to aggressively seek out new markets and to engage in smuggling with continental Europe.  In Fiume [[Andrija Ljudevit Adami\u0107|Andrea Lodovico de Adamich]] emerged to become the wealthiest and most powerful merchant in Fiume.<ref>Avakumovic, Ivan. \"An Episode In The Continental System in the Illyrian Provinces\", ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 14. No 3 (Summer, 1954), pp. 254-261.</ref>\n\nIn August 1813, Austria declared war on France. Austrian troops led by General Franz Tomassich invaded the Illyrian provinces. Croat troops enrolled in the French army switched sides. The English General Nugent, serving the Austrian Empire, liberated the town from the reign of the \"Illyrian passing glory\" on 26 August 1813.<ref>Antoljak, Stjepan. \"Prekosavska Hrvatska i pitanje njene reinkorporacije (1813 - 1822)\", in Stjepan Antoljak, Stjepan. 1994.

''Metternich und die Frage Ungarns'', Akademiai Kiado, Budapest.</ref> In the Restoration 1814-1822 Fiume was put under the ephemeral \"[[Kingdom of Illyria (1816\u20131849)|Kingdom of Illyria]]\". By the end of the Austrian reign (1823), including the first Hungarian period too (1776\u20131809), Fiume hardly developed; only minor constructions were done. The number of the inhabitants shows slow increase: in 1777 the number of population was 5312, in 1819 it was 8345.\n\nFrancis I, with the order of 1 June 1822, gave back Fiume to Hungary to form the centre of the Hungarial Littoral (Littorale Hungaricum) with the by-ports of Buccari, Portor\u00e9 and Novi. The new Hungarian governor, Antal Majl\u00e1th (son of J\u00f3zsef Majl\u00e1th, the first Hungarian governor in Fiume) took over the duty on 15 October 1822. Emperor Francis, with a rescript in 1822, made autonomous the [[Circle (country subdivision)|Kreis]]e of Carlstadt and Fiume, and thereby, in November 1822, restored the Comitatus of Severin.<ref>\u017dic, Igor. ''A Short History of the City of Rijeka'', Adami\u0107, Rijeka, 2007.</ref>\n\nFiume was invited to participate also to the Croatian Diet in Zagreb, where Antun Mihanovi\u0107 then employed as a gubernial secretary was sent. In 1825&nbsp;\u2013 26 [[Antun Mihanovi\u0107]] (1796-1861)  and [[Andrija Ljudevit Adami\u0107|Andrea Lodovico Adamich]] (1766\u20131828) participated at the workings of the Hungarian Diet in Presburg.  Adamich there tried to promote a project for a Hungarian commercial company centred in Fiume circulating a memo (eszrevetelek) with scarce success. Afterwards he served as mercantile deputy of Fiume from 1827 until his death in 1828.<ref>Riccardo GIGANTE, \"Stralcio della corrispondenza di L. A. Adamich col tenente maresciallo Laval Nugent\", Fiume (XV-XVI) 1937-1938, p. 131.</ref>\n\nFiuman deputies participated also in the role of observes to the Croatian diets of 1830 and 1832. Far more important was the Hungarian diets from 1832 to 1836 that started the period of liberal reforms in Hungary. With the article XIX of the Hungarian law of 1836 the Fiuman judiciary was firmly included into the Hungarian judicial system and the local civic magistrate lost his judicial capacities transferred to a local court, the ''Giudizio Civico Distrettuale della fedelissima Citt\u00e0, Porto franco e Distretto di Fiume''.\n\nAfter the governorship of [[Ferencz \u00dcrm\u00e9nyi]] (1780 - 1858, governor from 1823 to 1837) P\u00e1l Kiss de Nemsk\u00e9r became new governor while Count Ferenc Zichy (1811\u20131900) acted as deputy governor and was to become Hungarian secretary of state for commerce in the Sz\u00e9chenyi ministry of 1848. After the death of Adamich, Cimiotti become deputy of Fiume at the royal Hungarian Diet serving in 1836 first as observer, and then taking active part in 1843/4. One of his first task as a deputy, together with Mih\u00e1ly Horhy was to draft a plan for political modernization of Fiume, preserving its autonomy within the Hungarian political system. After the inclusion of the city in the Hungarian system Cimiotti exploited the request (Torvenyjavaslat a Hajd\u00faker\u00fcletrol 1843/4) advanced by the [[Hajd\u00fa County]] (Hajd\u00fas\u00e1g) who constituted a \"warrior estate\" within Hungarian feudal society and were emancipated by [[Istv\u00e1n Bocskay]], Lord of [[Bihar]], in 1604-1606 from the jurisdiction of their lords. As  the Hajd\u00fa, [[Jassic people|J\u00e1sz]]  and  [[Cumans|Cuman]] districts were freed of feudal obligations providing military service so Fiume had to be exempted by providing maritime service for the Kingdom of Hungary. Cimiotti took also the privileges granted to the [[Gelnica|G\u00f6lnicb\u00e1nya]] (German: G\u00f6llnitz) miners who, as Bavarian settlers invited by the king of Hungary were granted special privileges.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/1130907/Giuseppe_Ludovico_Cimiotti_1810-1892_e_le_problematiche_origini_della_storiografia_fiumana |title=Giuseppe Ludovico Cimiotti (1810-1892) e le problematiche origini della storiografia fiumana |author=Klinger, William |authorlink=William Klinger |publisher='Fiume.

In order to get support for the modernization of the port, the \"Mercantile deputation\" of Fiume sent Ferenc Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r to lobby at the Pest Exchange court in 1842. In 1843 Josef Bainville a French engineer from Fiume who reproposed an older French plan, commissioned by Adamich during the Illyrian provinces. Bainville settled in Hungary and designed a plan for the city of  Szeged.\nStill in 1842 ambitious plans for advancing trade with Hungary, Wallachia and the Banat were advanced and Cimiotti managed to involve the engineer Mario A. Sanfermo who elaborated a plan to connect Fiume with the Sissek&nbsp;\u2013 Carlstadt railroad and its extension to Vukovar and thereby reach Serbia and Wallachia. The railroad Fiume&nbsp;\u2013 Vukovar, intended for Russian containment in the context of the [[Eastern Question]], was enthusiastically supported by Kossuth and the founding of a company ''Vukovar&nbsp;\u2013 Fiumana Unitae Societatis Pestano Fluminensis ad construendam semitam ferratam'' was voted by the Hungarian diet in 1848. In this way the well-known debates of Kossuth and [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] (who visited Fiume in 1844 and decided to allocate 260,000 guldens for port modernization) about how to build up the railway leading from Central Hungary to Fiume, appeared in Fiume in 1846. In the same year one of the articles of Kossuth, titled ''To the Sea Hungarians! Go to the Sea!'' was published in a periodical of the Trade Association.\n\nIn 1846 [[Vincenzo de Domini]] (1816 - 1903) become professor at the local nautical school. A Venetian patriot, close to the circles of Kossuth, he will be entrusted together with [[Gaspare Matcovich]] and [[Spiridione Gopcevich]] (1815 - 1861) with the project to turn the brick ''Implacable'' into a Hungarian man of war. The armament of the ship, commanded by de Domini, led Jela\u010di\u0107 to send an expedition and occupy Fiume on 31 August 1848 with Croat troops.\n\n== 1848-1870 ==\n{{Empty section|date=December 2009}}\n\n== Hungarian port 1870-1918 ==\n[[File:Fiume 1900.jpg|thumb|Rijeka around the year 1900|right|250px|thumb]]\n\nFollowing the creation of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Compromise of 1867]], Fiume was attached to Hungary for the third and last time in 1870. Croatia had constitutional autonomy within Hungary, but as Hungary's only international port, the city became an independent ''[[corpus separatum (Fiume)|corpus separatum]]'', governed directly from [[Budapest]] by an appointed governor. Austria's [[Trieste]] and Hungary's Fiume competed for maritime trade.\n\nFiume also had a significant naval base, and in the mid-19th century it became the site of the Austro-Hungarian Naval Academy (K.u.K. Marine-Akademie), where the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] trained its officers.\n\n[[Giovanni de Ciotta]] (Mayor from 1872 to 1896) proved to be the most authoritative local political leader. Under his leadership, an impressive phase of expansion of the city started, marked by major port development, fueled by the general expansion of international trade and the city's connection (1873) to the Hungarian and Austrian railway networks. Hungarian support proved to be crucial to the development of the port of Fiume and Ciotta was the key person in assuring it. From 1872 to 1896 (apart from a short interruption in 1884) he was the mayor of the city. Following the financial crisis of 1873, that culminated in 1875, the conservative liberal De\u00e1k Party had to face a crisis from which it survived only with a merger with the more numerous conservative Left Center of [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]]. The \"new\" Liberal Party of Hungary, was to rule Hungary (and Fiume) from 1875 to 1890, marking the golden years of Ciotta, later known as the ''Idyll''.<ref>Depoli Attilio, L\u2019unione di Fiume alla Corona ungarica ed il suo \"iter\" legislativo, ''Fiume'' Anno X, N.3-4 luglio-dicembre 1963, Pag.97.</ref>\n\nUnder his lead an impressive phase of expansion of the city started, marked by the completion of the railway Fiume&nbsp;\u2013 Budapest, the construction of the modern port and the initiation of modern industrial and commercial enterprises such as the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company \"[[Adria (disambiguation)|Adria]]\", and the Whitehead Torpedo Works. In 1866, [[Robert Whitehead]], manager of Stabilimento Tecnico Fiumano (an Austrian engineering company engaged in providing engines for the Austro-Hungarian Navy), experimented on the first [[torpedo]]. Ciotta's contribution was crucial as he financed [[Robert Whitehead]]'s efforts in producing a viable torpedo. Modern industrial and commercial enterprises such as the Papermill, situated in the Rje\u010dina canyon, producing worldwide known cigarette paper, became trademarks of the city.\n\nThe population grew from only 21,000 in 1880 to 50,000 in 1910. A lot of major civic buildings went up at that time, including the Governor's Palace designed by the Hungarian architect [[Alajos Hauszmann]]. In 1885 the sumptuous new theatre was finished modelled on that of Budapest and Vienna, costing him a political crisis in 1884 for the raising building costs. While on army service he met [[John Leard]], another fiuman of English origins. Ciotta with Leard in 1889 pushed forward the ''Piano regolatore'' the comprehensive urbanisation plan for the city. The new plan laid down the plan for a modern commercial city, destroying most of the older buildings and roads and introducing the regular planning as it was done in Budapest and other cities of the time. In 1891 the ''Acquedotto Ciotta'' was finished providing the city with modern sewage and water supply system. He was also a founder of several philanthropic initiatives and institutions.\n\nThe \"system  Ciotta\" underwent crisis in 1896 when Hungarian Prime Minister [[Dezs\u0151 B\u00e1nffy]] started a centralizing policy towards Fiume.  Ciotta, being unable to assure the equilibrium between Fiume and Hungary, resigned and retired to private life, following the Governor [[Lajos gr\u00f3f Batthy\u00e1ny de Nemetujv\u00e1r]]. As a response [[Michele Maylender]], backed by [[Luigi Ossoinack]] (initiator of the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company \"Adria\"), founded a new party, the [[Autonomist Association]], ending the rule of the Liberal Party of Hungary in Fiume.\n\nThe future mayor of [[New York City]], [[Fiorello La Guardia]], lived in the city at the turn of the 20th century, and reportedly even played [[football (soccer)|football]] for the local sports club.\n\n== The Italo-Yugoslav dispute and the Free State ==<!-- This section is linked from\n[[Porco Rosso]] -->\n{{Main|Italian Regency of Carnaro |Free State of Fiume}}\n[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|left|Residents of [[Fiume]] cheering D'Annunzio and his ''Legionari'', September 1919. At the time, Fiume had 22,488 (62% of the population) Italians in a total population of 35,839 inhabitants.]]\n\nHabsburg-ruled [[Austria-Hungary]]'s disintegration in the closing weeks of [[World War I]] in the fall of 1918 led to the establishment of rival Croatian and Italian administrations in the city; both [[Italy]] and the founders of the new [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) claimed sovereignty based on their \"[[Irredentism|irredentist]]\" (\"unredeemed\") ethnic populations.\n\nAn international force of Italian, French, Serbian, British and American troops occupied the city (November 1918) while its future was discussed at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] during the course of 1919.<ref>Stanislav Krakov, Dolazak srpske vojske na Rijeku i severni Jadran, Beograd: ''Jadranska Straza'', 1928/29; The Arrival of the Serbian Army in Fiume and the Northern Adriatic</ref>\n\nItaly based its claim on the fact that Italians were the largest single nationality within the city, 88% of total. Croats made up most of the remainder and were also a majority in the surrounding area, including the neighbouring town of [[Su\u0161ak, Rijeka|Su\u0161ak]].<ref>Anonymous, 1919. Reka-Fiume : notes sur l'histoire, la langue et la statistique, Beograd.</ref> [[Andrea Ossoinack]], who had been the last delegate from Fiume to the Hungarian Parliament, was admitted to the conference as a representative of Fiume, and essentially supported the Italian claims.\n\nOn 10 September 1919,  the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] was signed declaring the Austro-Hungarian monarchy dissolved. Negotiations over the future of the city were interrupted two days later when a force of Italian nationalist irregulars led by the poet [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] seized control of the city by force; d'Annunzio eventually established a state, the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]].<ref>Ledeen, Michael A. 1977. The First Duce. D\u2019Annunzio at Fiume, Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref>\n\nThe resumption of Italy's premiership by the liberal [[Giovanni Giolitti]] in June 1920 signalled a hardening of official attitudes to d'Annunzio's ''coup''. On 12 November, Italy and Yugoslavia concluded the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]], under which Rijeka was to be an independent state, the [[Free State of Fiume]], under a regime acceptable to both.<ref>Federzoni, Luigi. ''Il Trattato di Rapallo'', Bologna, Zanichelli, 1921.</ref> D'Annunzio's response was characteristically flamboyant and of doubtful judgment: his declaration of war against Italy invited the bombardment by Italian royal forces which led to his surrender of the city at the end of the year, after a five days resistance. Italian troops took over in January 1921. The election of an autonomist-led [[Constituent Assembly|constituent assembly]] for the territory did not put an end to strife: a brief Italian nationalist seizure of power was ended by the intervention of an Italian royal commissioner, and a short-lived local Fascist takeover in March 1922 ended in a third Italian military occupation. Seven months later Italy herself fell under Fascist rule.\n\n== Fiume under Fascist rule ==\n\nA period of diplomatic acrimony closed with the [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Treaty of Rome]] (27 January 1924), which assigned Fiume to Italy and Su\u0161ak to Yugoslavia, with joint port administration.<ref>Benedetti, Giulio. ''La pace di Fiume'', Bologna, Zanichelli, 1924.</ref> Formal Italian annexation (16 March 1924) inaugurated twenty years of Italian government, followed by twenty months of [[Germany|German]] military occupation in World War II. In 1938 [[Temistocle Testa]] prefect from [[Udine]] become prefect of the Carnaro province.\n\n== Rijeka in World War II ==\n\n[[File:Fiume (Rijeka) bombing by RAF in 1944.jpg|right|thumb|Rijeka under aerial bombardment by [[Royal Air Force]] airplanes, 1944]]\nAfter the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|surrender of Italy to the Allies]] in September 1943, Rijeka and the surrounding territories were occupied by [[Germany]], becoming part of the [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral|Adriatic Littoral Zone]]. Because of its industries (oil refinery, torpedo factory, shipyards) and its port facilities, the city was a target of frequent Anglo-American air attacks. Some of the worst attacks happened on 12 January 1944  (attack on the refinery, part of the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|Oil Campaign]]) [http://www.b17pbemgame.com/317th_bomb_squadron_roster.htm], on 3\u20136 November 1944, when a series of attacks resulted in at least 125 deaths and between 15 and 25 February 1945 (200 dead, 300 wounded).<ref>KAKO JE POTOPLJEN KIEBITZ?, Slavko Suzi\u0107, Susacka Revija 54/55, 2007, see [http://www.klub-susacana.hr/revija/clanak.asp?Num=54-55&C=8] (in Croatian)</ref>  The harbour area was destroyed by retreating German troops at the very end of the war. Yugoslav troops entered the city on 3 May 1945, after heavy fighting.\n\n== Post World War II expulsion of Italians ==\n{{Main| Istrian exodus}}\nThe aftermath of the war saw the city's fate once again resolved by a combination of force and diplomacy. This time, Yugoslav troops advanced (early May 1945) as far west as [[Trieste]] in their campaign against the German occupiers of both countries. The city of Rijeka thus became Croatian (i.e., Yugoslav), a situation formalised by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaty]] between Italy and the wartime Allies on 10 February 1947. Once the change in sovereignty was formalised, 58,000 of the 66,000 Italian-speakers were more or less hastily pushed through various means out of the city (known in Italian as ''esuli'' or the exiled ones). The discrimination and persecution many of them experienced at the hands of the Yugoslav officials in the last days of World War II and the first 9 years of peace remained painful memories. Summary executions of alleged fascists (that at times were proven anti-fascists), Italian public servants, military officials and even normal civilians, limited acts of terrorism, imprisonment and loss of work and public positions forced most ethnic Italians to abandon Rijeka in order to avoid further violence. The [[Free_Territory_of_Trieste#Dissolution|Trieste crisis]] in 1954 gave the final pretext to Yugoslav authorities to strip the local Italian-speaking populace of most of its rights (but most were being lost in the years building up to 1954) and enact a more radical and successful assimilation of the previous Italian majority into the new Yugoslav majority.\n\n== In Yugoslavia ==\nBecause of its importance for the country's shipbuilding industry was from 1947 under the responsibility of the Ministry of National Defence until 1954.  In 1948 the main shipyard, renamed Maj 3, which was to serve as a base for the restored shipbuilding industry. In 1949, it launched the first post-war Yugoslav ship, the [[MB Zagreb]] of 4000 DWT. Along with the shipbuilding industry would develop one for marine equipment. After being rebuilt, the Torpedo Factory started to produce diesel engines. The former foundry Skull now Svjetlost was devoted to the production of electrical navigation equipment, while the Rikard Ben\u010di\u0107 manufactured watercraft and other auxiliary equipment. The oil refinery was back in 1948 pre-war production with 110,000 tonnes in the early Fifties it was able to process 200,000 tonnes of oil. At the time, it was supplying 37.6% of the country.\n\nDuring the period 1960-1990 Rijeka is a city that aspires to the greatest achievements and equips a heavy industry while dreaming of an Utopian tomorrow.\nAfter Edo Jardas, the following mayors followed: Franjo \u0160irola (1959\u20131964), Nikola Pavleti\u0107 (1964\u20131968), and Dragutin Haramija (1968\u20131969), Neda Andri\u0107 (1969\u20131974), Nikola Pavleti\u0107 for the second time (1974\u20131979), [[Vilim Mulc]] (1979\u20131982), Josip \u0160tefan (1982\u20131984), Zdravko Sar\u0161on (1985\u20131987) and \u017deljko Lu\u017eavec (1988\u20131993). The majority of mayors came from small towns in the immediate surroundings of the city.\n\nRegarding the economic situation, the traffic of the port complex had increased from 420,000 tons in 1946 to more than 20,000,000 tons in 1980. The port was involved in more than 50% of traffic across the country and about 80% in terms of transit. In 1980, Rijeka handled 20% of exports from Croatia and 10% of those of [[Yugoslavia]]. In 1980, when the merchant navy was at its peak, Rijeka shipping had a cargo capacity of 500,000 tons. [[Jugolinija]] was the largest shipping company of the state while [[Jadrolinija]] dealt with 49 ships and passenger transportation service by ferry-boats. Approximately 23,000 people were employed in industry in that year. Over 80% of the total industrial production was produced by the energy sector (electric power industry, oil processing and coal), as well as shipbuilding. This feature coupled with the low number of finished products explains why industry of Rijeka collapsed in the early Nineties. In 1982 there were 92,489 employees from a population of 193,000. The oil refinery treated 8,000,000 tonnes - 28% of the total state turnover. The plant had been based in Urinj since 1966. In the Eighties the construction of a petrochemical complex in [[Omi\u0161alj]] began, which later made one of the biggest losses for the state. The 3 May shipyard handled about one third of the shipbuilding industry. The peak in production was achieved between 1971 and 1975, when 32 ships were built, totalling more than 1,200,000 gross tons. These vessels were mainly for export. In the Eighties smaller boats were built and production increased to employ 7,000 shipyard workers and become the largest company in Rijeka. At the same time the shipyard [[Viktor Lenac]] in [[Martin\u0161\u010dica]] developed to become the largest repairs yard in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe development of the metalworking industry was linked to the needs of shipbuilding. Thus Vulkan manufactured cranes for the Rikard Ben\u010di\u0107 ship pumps, Torpedo manufactured diesel engines and tractors, Rade Kon\u010dar built electric generators while Metalografi\u010dki Kombinat was directed towards the production of metal packaging for the purposes of refinery. Civil engineering was expanding to the point that cooperatives such as Primorje, Jadran, Kvarner and Konstruktor employed some 10,000 workers overall in 1981. More than 6,000 of them were engaged in commerce with Brodokomerc. This was reflected in the construction of many new residential buildings in the city such as the five buildings in \u0160kurinje, all 26 floors in height.\n\nThe GHETALDUS building on Korzo, designed by Zdenko Kolacio (1949), opens the period of modern architecture. Josip Uhlik designed the building of Social Insurance. Igor Emili created designs for U\u017ear\u0161ka (1959) and \u0160porerova (1968) streets, the department store Varteks (1975), the Ri-Adria bank (later Jugobanka, 1986) in the old part of the city, and also for the buildings Kra\u0161 (1964) and Brodomaterijal II (1970) on the Korzo. Ada Felice-Ro\u0161i\u0107 designed the store Korzo (1972) with a front flanking a successful access to the old part of town while Ninoslav and Vjera Ku\u010dan designed the department store RI (1974). A series of business buildings are the work of Vladimir Grube\u0161i\u0107: Jadroagent (1977\u20131984), Delta (1983\u20131984), Privredna banka Zagreb (1986), Jadrosped, all located in the old part of town, as well as the Croatia Lines (1982\u20131992). One of the most accomplished achievements was the construction of the Rije\u010dka banka, according to a draft Kazimir O\u0161trogovi\u0107 (1966). The project of the Museum of the Revolution (now the Municipal Museum) was designed by Neven \u0160egvi\u0107 (1976), and the office tower at HPT-Centar Kozala was designed by N. Ku\u010dan and V. Antolovi\u0107 (1975). The architect Boris Maga\u0161 is the author of two major buildings: the Faculty of Law (1980 with Olga Maga\u0161), and the Church of St. Nicholas (1981\u20131988).\n\n== In independent Croatia ==\n{{Empty section|date=December 2009}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Corpus separatum (Fiume)]]\n*[[Postage stamps and postal history of Fiume]]\n*[[List of governors and heads of state of Fiume]]\n* [[Names of European cities in different languages: Q\u2013T#R|Other names of Rijeka]]\n* [[Timeline of Rijeka history]]\n*[[Imperial Estate]]\n*[[Free Imperial City]]\n*[[List of states of the Holy Roman Empire]]\n*[[History of Croatia]]\n*[[History of Slovenia]]\n*[[History of Austria]]\n*[[History of Hungary]]\n\n== References ==\n{{refimprove|date=April 2015}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{see also|Timeline of Rijeka#Bibliography}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|History of Rijeka}}\n* Europeana.

The members of BK Idrott joined the newly created football department of [[IFK Malm\u00f6]] in 1909, but soon left because of issues between the two clubs.

However, after six months the club changed its colours to red and white and played in red and white striped shirts and black shorts to symbolize the fact that Malm\u00f6 FF was a new club, the club continued to play in red and white until 1920. The first club logo was also red and white in accordance with the club kit.\n\n==1910\u20131920==\nThe club spent their first ten years in local and regional divisions as there was no official national league competition, playing the majority of their matches in the city division called Malm\u00f6m\u00e4sterskapen. They also competed in regional competitions in [[Scania]], and played matches against Danish clubs. In 1916 Malm\u00f6 FF reached the final of the Scanian regional competition (''Distriktsm\u00e4sterskapen'') for the first time, playing against rival [[Helsingborgs IF]] but losing 3\u20134.<ref>Smitt, 2009, p. 17.</ref> The club defeated local rival IFK Malm\u00f6 three times during the season, and thus earned the unofficial but much desired title of Malm\u00f6's best football club.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> In 1917 Malm\u00f6 FF competed in [[Svenska M\u00e4sterskapet]] for the first time, a cup tournament for the title of [[List of Swedish football champions|Swedish champions]], but lost their first match in the second qualifying round 4\u20131 against IFK Malm\u00f6.

The club entered the decade as reigning Allsvenskan champions and with five consecutive league titles during the last years of the 1980s. The [[1990 Allsvenskan|1990]] season was the last season to feature the [[Allsvenskan play-offs]] before the introduction of [[M\u00e4sterskapsserien]] in [[1991 Allsvenskan|1991]] to prevent the rapidly decreasing attendance figures in Swedish football. For the first time since 1972 Malm\u00f6 FF finished below the top five teams in the league in 1990. This meant that they missed the last edition of the Allsvenskan play-offs.\n\nIn 1991 and 1992 the post-season league M\u00e4sterskapsserien was played, the sixth best teams of the regular Allsvenskan season participated. Malm\u00f6 FF participated in both editions after finishing third in the Allsvenskan season of 1991 and fifth in 1992. However the club failed to make a mark in the new competition as the finished fourth in 1991 and sixth in 1992. Malm\u00f6 FF's average attendance reached its lowest point since the club was promoted to Allsvenskan back in the 1930s, the 1991 season saw a meagre attendance of 4,005 spectators. In [[1993 Allsvenskan|1993]] the league format was reformed to the format that existed before the Allsvenskan play-offs, the league champions was yet again recognized as Swedish champions. The league was now contested of fourteen teams, playing each other twice to make up 26 rounds of play, a format that continued until 2007.\n\nAfter finishing in 10th place for the 1993 season, Malm\u00f6 FF entered a fairly successful period during the mid 1990s. Between 1994 and 1997 the club finished in the top four every year and reached the [[1996 Svenska Cupen Final]], most notably the most recent Svenska Cupen final for the club. These results also meant that Malm\u00f6 FF was entitled to play regularly in European competitions again for the first time since the mid 1980s, the club played four consecutive seasons in the [[UEFA Cup]] between 1995 and 1998, however never reaching past the first round. Notably Malm\u00f6 FF faced [[1979 European Cup Final]] opponents [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in a two legged fixture in the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup]], ultimately losing the tie on [[Away goals rule|away goals]]. The most successful of these mid 1990s season was the [[1996 Allsvenskan|1996]] season where the club finished as runners-up in Allsvenskan, however ten points behind the champions [[IFK G\u00f6teborg]].\n\nThe last two seasons of the decade saw a decline in the club's result. The [[1998 Allsvenskan]] season resulted in a tenth place for the team as they narrowly escaped the relegation play-offs with one point to spare. The [[1999 Allsvenskan|1999]] season turned out to be a different story altogether as Malm\u00f6 FF were relegated for the first time in its history and the first time they dropped down a division since the demotion in 1933\u201334. This ended a streak of 63 consecutive seasons in Allsvenskan, a standing Allsvenskan record as of 2015. Malm\u00f6 FF ended the season in 13th out of 14th place, two points behind the teams playing the relegation play-offs. The relegation was confirmed in the 25th matchday on 23 October after a 3\u20130 loss against [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]] at [[R\u00e5sunda Stadium|R\u00e5sunda]]. In the 1999 season Malm\u00f6 FF had moved their home fixtures from [[Malm\u00f6 Stadion]] to their old ground [[Malm\u00f6 IP]] which had finished an extensive renovation project in August 1999. This was due to Malm\u00f6 Stadion being too large for the decreasing attendance figures. In the end the second half of the 1999 season proved that Malm\u00f6 IP was too small and couldn't provide the same facilities as Malm\u00f6 Stadion could. This resulted in safety concerns that led to Malm\u00f6 FF moving back to Malm\u00f6 Stadion for the [[2000 Superettan]] season, Malm\u00f6 FF's first season in the second tier of Swedish football since [[1935\u201336 Swedish football Division 2|1935\u201336]].\n\n==2000\u20132010==\nThe return to Allsvenskan was the start of the successful early 2000s, under the management of [[Tom Prahl]] who was appointed manager in January 2002 succeeding [[Michael Andersson (footballer)|Michael Andersson]]. The club finished in the top three three times in a row under Prahl's management. In [[2004 Allsvenskan|2004]], Malm\u00f6 FF won Allsvenskan, the club's fifteenth Swedish Championship. This ended the longest title drought in the club's history after having won their latest Swedish Championship in [[1988 Allsvenskan|1988]] and their latest Allsvenskan title in [[1989 Allsvenskan|1989]]. In the following season the club reached the third and last qualifying round for the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306]] [[UEFA Champions League]] but were defeated by Swiss club [[FC Thun]].

Malm\u00f6 FF therefore achieved automatic qualification to the group stage of the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League]], the first time the club qualified for this stage since the re branding of the competition in 2009. The club finished at the bottom of the group table with one point after failing to achieve more than a draw in six matches. The other teams that was part of the group were Ukrainian [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]], Dutch [[AZ (football club)|AZ]] and Austrian [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]]. For the [[2011 Allsvenskan]] the club finished fourth and thefore failed to qualify for Europe the coming season. A major point of discussion during the season was manager Roland Nilsson's mid-season departure from the club in May and [[Rikard Norling]]'s appointment in June. A bright point of the 2011 season was Malm\u00f6 FF's progression to the quarter\u2013finals in the [[2011 Svenska Cupen]], the club's best cup result since they reached the semi-finals in 2002.\n\nFor Rikard Norling's first full season as manager in 2012 the club managed had only the [[2012 Allsvenskan]] to focus on since they had failed to qualify for European play as well as Svenska Cupen changing format to a fall-spring schedule which made 2012 a gap year with only one cup match for the club. As the season progressed Malm\u00f6 FF chased IF Elfsborg in the top of the league table and spent the majority of the season in second place. With only two matches to be played the club had overtaken Elfsborg and thus a golden opportunity to win the title. A draw and a loss in the final two fixtures of the season resulted in Malm\u00f6 FF dropping down to third place in the final league table.

In 1916 Malm\u00f6 FF reached the final of the Scanian regional competition (''Distriktsm\u00e4sterskapen'') for the first time, playing against rival [[Helsingborgs IF]] but losing 3\u20134.<ref>Smitt, 2009, p. 17.</ref> The club defeated local rival IFK Malm\u00f6 three times during the season, and thus earned the unofficial but much desired title of Malm\u00f6's best football club.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> In 1917 Malm\u00f6 FF competed in [[Svenska M\u00e4sterskapet]] for the first time, a cup tournament for the title of [[List of Swedish football champions|Swedish champions]], but lost their first match in the second qualifying round 4\u20131 against IFK Malm\u00f6. The club continued to play in the cup until 1922, reaching the quarter-finals in 1920 when they were knocked out by [[Landskrona BoIS]]. The cup was eventually discontinued and the title of Swedish champions was given to the winners of [[Allsvenskan]] which was first created for the [[1924\u201325 in Swedish football|1924\u201325]] season.<ref>Smitt, 2009, p. 258.</ref>\n\nIn 1920 the [[Swedish Football Association]] invited Swedish football clubs to compete in official national competitions. Malm\u00f6 FF earned a place in Division&nbsp;2 Sydsvenska Serien. They won this division in the first season, and were promoted to Svenska Serien V\u00e4stra, the highest level of competition in Sweden at the time. However, they were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] after a single season, and found themselves back in Sydsvenska Serien for nearly a decade until they again achieved promotion to Allsvenskan, in 1931.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\n==1920\u20131930==\n\n{{Empty section|date=December 2012}}\n\n==1931\u20131943 \u2013 First arrival to the finest assembly and gossiping rivals==\nMalm\u00f6 FF participated for the first time in Swedish top and at the time only national league, [[Allsvenskan]], in the 1931\u201332 season. During their first season their local rivals [[IFK Malm\u00f6]] was relegated,<ref>See 1931\u201332 season at http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zwedhist.html</ref> which later might have an unexpected affect also on Malm\u00f6 FF. And by Christmas two years later, as the club gave watches to their players as Christmas gifts, this became supposedly known to IFK Malm\u00f6. Somehow these gifts later became known by the Swedish Football Association in Stockholm, and was by them considered to be a crime against the harsh amateur rules of the time. The club was relegated and all their games during the spring was cancelled.<ref>See 1933\u201334 season at http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zwedhist.html</ref> Legendary chairman [[Eric Persson]] was for the rest of his days known to have a strong repulsive antipathy towards the yellow IFK Malm\u00f6, which likely was the gossip tubs. The club returned to Allsvenskan in the 1936\u201337 season.<ref>See 1936\u201337 season at http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zwedhist.html</ref> and has since then only been outside the finest league in Sweden during one single season.

The club entered the decade as reigning Allsvenskan champions and with five consecutive league titles during the last years of the 1980s. The [[1990 Allsvenskan|1990]] season was the last season to feature the [[Allsvenskan play-offs]] before the introduction of [[M\u00e4sterskapsserien]] in [[1991 Allsvenskan|1991]] to prevent the rapidly decreasing attendance figures in Swedish football. For the first time since 1972 Malm\u00f6 FF finished below the top five teams in the league in 1990. This meant that they missed the last edition of the Allsvenskan play-offs.\n\nIn 1991 and 1992 the post-season league M\u00e4sterskapsserien was played, the sixth best teams of the regular Allsvenskan season participated. Malm\u00f6 FF participated in both editions after finishing third in the Allsvenskan season of 1991 and fifth in 1992. However the club failed to make a mark in the new competition as the finished fourth in 1991 and sixth in 1992. Malm\u00f6 FF's average attendance reached its lowest point since the club was promoted to Allsvenskan back in the 1930s, the 1991 season saw a meagre attendance of 4,005 spectators. In [[1993 Allsvenskan|1993]] the league format was reformed to the format that existed before the Allsvenskan play-offs, the league champions was yet again recognized as Swedish champions. The league was now contested of fourteen teams, playing each other twice to make up 26 rounds of play, a format that continued until 2007.\n\nAfter finishing in 10th place for the 1993 season, Malm\u00f6 FF entered a fairly successful period during the mid 1990s. Between 1994 and 1997 the club finished in the top four every year and reached the [[1996 Svenska Cupen Final]], most notably the most recent Svenska Cupen final for the club. These results also meant that Malm\u00f6 FF was entitled to play regularly in European competitions again for the first time since the mid 1980s, the club played four consecutive seasons in the [[UEFA Cup]] between 1995 and 1998, however never reaching past the first round. Notably Malm\u00f6 FF faced [[1979 European Cup Final]] opponents [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in a two legged fixture in the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup]], ultimately losing the tie on [[Away goals rule|away goals]]. The most successful of these mid 1990's season was the [[1996 Allsvenskan|1996]] season where the club finished as runners-up in Allsvenskan, however ten points behind the champions [[IFK G\u00f6teborg]].\n\nThe last two seasons of the decade saw a decline in the club's result. The [[1998 Allsvenskan]] season resulted in a tenth place for the team as they narrowly escaped the relegation play-offs with one point to spare. The [[1999 Allsvenskan|1999]] season turned out to be a different story altogether as Malm\u00f6 FF were relegated for the first time in its history and the first time they dropped down a division since the demotion in 1933\u201334. This ended a streak of 63 consecutive seasons in Allsvenskan, a standing Allsvenskan record as of 2015. Malm\u00f6 FF ended the season in 13th out of 14th place, two points behind the teams playing the relegation play-offs. The relegation was confirmed in the 25th matchday on 23 October after a 3\u20130 loss against [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]] at [[R\u00e5sunda Stadium|R\u00e5sunda]]. In the 1999 season Malm\u00f6 FF had moved their home fixtures from [[Malm\u00f6 Stadion]] to their old ground [[Malm\u00f6 IP]] which had finished an extensive renovation project in August 1999. This was due to Malm\u00f6 Stadion being too large for the decreasing attendance figures. In the end the second half of the 1999 season proved that Malm\u00f6 IP was too small and couldn't provide the same facilities as Malm\u00f6 Stadion could. This resulted in safety concerns that led to Malm\u00f6 FF moving back to Malm\u00f6 Stadion for the [[2000 Superettan]] season, Malm\u00f6 FF's first season in the second tier of Swedish football since [[1935\u201336 Swedish football Division 2|1935\u201336]].\n\n==2000\u20132010==\nThe return to Allsvenskan was the start of the successful early 2000s, under the management of [[Tom Prahl]] who was appointed manager in January 2002 succeeding [[Michael Andersson (footballer)|Michael Andersson]]. The club finished in the top three three times in a row under Prahl's management. In [[2004 Allsvenskan|2004]], Malm\u00f6 FF won Allsvenskan, the club's fifteenth Swedish Championship. This ended the longest title drought in the club's history after having won their latest Swedish Championship in [[1988 Allsvenskan|1988]] and their latest Allsvenskan title in [[1989 Allsvenskan|1989]]. In the following season the club reached the third and last qualifying round for the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306]] [[UEFA Champions League]] but were defeated by Swiss club [[FC Thun]].

However like in 2005 the club failed to progress to the group stage and the competition proper after losing 3\u20134 on aggregate against the Croatian [[2010\u201311 Prva HNL]] champions [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]]. Malm\u00f6 FF therefore achieved automatic qualification to the group stage of the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League]], the first time the club qualified for this stage since the re branding of the competition in 2009. The club finished at the bottom of the group table with one point after failing to achieve more than a draw in six matches. The other teams that was part of the group were Ukrainian [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]], Dutch [[AZ (football club)|AZ]] and Austrian [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]]. For the [[2011 Allsvenskan]] the club finished fourth and thefore failed to qualify for Europe the coming season. A major point of discussion during the season was manager Roland Nilsson's mid-season departure from the club in May and [[Rikard Norling]]'s appointment in June. A bright point of the 2011 season was Malm\u00f6 FF's progression to the quarter\u2013finals in the [[2011 Svenska Cupen]], the club's best cup result since they reached the semi-finals in 2002.\n\nFor Rikard Norling's first full season as manager in 2012 the club managed had only the [[2012 Allsvenskan]] to focus on since they had failed to qualify for European play as well as Svenska Cupen changing format to a fall-spring schedule which made 2012 a gap year with only one cup match for the club. As the season progressed Malm\u00f6 FF chased IF Elfsborg in the top of the league table and spent the majority of the season in second place. With only two matches to be played the club had overtaken Elfsborg and thus a golden opportunity to win the title. A draw and a loss in the final two fixtures of the season resulted in Malm\u00f6 FF dropping down to third place in the final league table.

In this period southern states had already begun to pass new constitutions that raised barriers to voter registration, following Mississippi's in 1890, and essentially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most freedmen and many poor whites. By 1900, Fitzgerald was a [[sundown town]], prohibiting African Americans from living there.<ref>{{cite news|title=How Northern Settlers Solve the Negro Problem|work=The Lexington Gazette|location=Lexington, Virginia|date=March 28, 1900|p=1|via=Chronicling America|url=In the colony of Fitzgerald, in Georgia, there are very few negroes, and not one allowed to live in the city of Fitzgerald.

The team was called the [[Fitzgerald Pioneers]]. The club had no affiliation with any major league club during the five seasons of operation in the Georgia State League. After the 1952 season, the Fitzgerald Pioneers relocated to [[Sandersville, Georgia|Sandersville]] and became the Sandersville Wacos, which were affiliated with the [[Milwaukee Braves]] for the 1953 season. The team ended their last season in 1956, under different affiliation.\n\nFitzgerald got a replacement team for the Pioneers in 1953 when the [[Moultrie Giants]] of the [[Georgia\u2013Florida League]] moved to town. The Moultrie club was a charter member of the Georgia\u2013Florida League when it began operations in 1946. After relocating to Fitzgerald and becoming an affiliate of the [[Cincinnati Redlegs]], the new edition of the Fitzgerald Pioneers lasted one season (1954) saw the team name changed to the [[Fitzgerald Redlegs]]. After two years in Fitzgerald, the club returned to Moultrie. It ceased operating in 1958 under the name [[Brunswick Phillies]].\n\nAfter the Fitzgerald Redlegs left, the city was without a team for the 1955 season. The next year the [[Cordele, Georgia|Cordele]] club relocated to Fitzgerald after ten seasons in Cordele. They changed affiliation back to what were now called the [[Kansas City A's]], and the [[Fitzgerald A's]] played for the 1956 season. The next year the club changed affiliation again, to the Baltimore Orioles, and the club was known as the [[Fitzgerald Orioles]] for the 1957 season. The Fitzgerald club relocated to [[Dublin, Georgia]] following the 1957 season and remained a Baltimore Orioles farm team; they played as the [[Dublin Orioles]] for the Georgia\u2013Florida League's last year of operation. Fitzgerald has not had a minor league in the 52 years since.\n\n==Notable people==<!--consensus reached to standardize this heading per WP:WikiProject Cities/US Guideline -->\n<!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\u2022 Only people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here.

The team was called the [[Fitzgerald Pioneers]]. The club had no affiliation with any major league club during the five seasons of operation in the Georgia State League. After the 1952 season, the Fitzgerald Pioneers relocated to [[Sandersville, Georgia|Sandersville]] and became the Sandersville Wacos, which were affiliated with the [[Milwaukee Braves]] for the 1953 season. The team ended their last season in 1956, under different affiliation.\n\nFitzgerald got a replacement team for the Pioneers in 1953 when the [[Moultrie Giants]] of the [[Georgia\u2013Florida League]] moved to town. The Moultrie club was a charter member of the Georgia\u2013Florida League when it began operations in 1946. After relocating to Fitzgerald and becoming an affiliate of the [[Cincinnati Redlegs]], the new edition of the Fitzgerald Pioneers lasted one season (1954) saw the team name changed to the [[Fitzgerald Redlegs]]. After two years in Fitzgerald, the club returned to Moultrie. It ceased operating in 1958 under the name [[Brunswick Phillies]].\n\nAfter the Fitzgerald Redlegs left, the city was without a team for the 1955 season. The next year the [[Cordele, Georgia|Cordele]] club relocated to Fitzgerald after ten seasons in Cordele. They changed affiliation back to what were now called the [[Kansas City A's]], and the [[Fitzgerald A's]] played for the 1956 season. The next year the club changed affiliation again, to the Baltimore Orioles, and the club was known as the [[Fitzgerald Orioles]] for the 1957 season. The Fitzgerald club relocated to [[Dublin, Georgia]] following the 1957 season and remained a Baltimore Orioles farm team; they played as the [[Dublin Orioles]] for the Georgia\u2013Florida League's last year of operation. Fitzgerald has not had a minor league in the 52 years since.\n\n==Notable people==<!--consensus reached to standardize this heading per WP:WikiProject Cities/US Guideline -->\n<!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\u2022 Only people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here.
