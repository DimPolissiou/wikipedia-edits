It follows the life of [[Elena Gilbert]] ([[Nina Dobrev]]), a teenage girl who has just lost both parents in a car accident, as she falls in love with a 162-year-old vampire named [[Stefan Salvatore]] ([[Paul Wesley]]). Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated as Stefan's mysterious older brother [[Damon Salvatore]] ([[Ian Somerhalder]]) returns, with a plan to bring back their past love Katherine Pierce (also played by Dobrev), a vampire who looks exactly like Elena. Although Damon initially harbors a grudge against his brother for forcing him to become a vampire, he later reconciles with Stefan and falls in love with Elena, creating a love triangle among the three. Both brothers protect Elena as they face various villains and threats to their town, including Katherine. The brothers' history and the town's mythology are revealed through flashbacks as the series goes on.\n\nAdditional storylines revolve around the other inhabitants of the town, most notably Elena's younger brother [[Jeremy Gilbert]] ([[Steven R.

It follows the life of [[Elena Gilbert]] ([[Nina Dobrev]]), a teenage girl who has just lost both parents in a car accident, as she falls in love with a 162-year-old vampire named [[Stefan Salvatore]] ([[Paul Wesley]]). Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated as Stefan's mysterious older brother [[Damon Salvatore]] ([[Ian Somerhalder]]) returns, with a plan to bring back their past love Katherine Pierce (also played by Dobrev), a vampire who looks exactly like Elena. Although Damon initially harbors a grudge against his brother for forcing him to become a vampire, he later reconciles with Stefan and falls in love with Elena, creating a love triangle among the three. Both brothers protect Elena as they face various villains and threats to their town, including Katherine. The brothers' history and the town's mythology are revealed through flashbacks as the series goes on.\n\nAdditional storylines revolve around the other inhabitants of the town, most notably Elena's younger brother [[Jeremy Gilbert]] ([[Steven R.

It stars [[Jeff Bridges]] as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, a [[Los Angeles]] [[slacker]] and avid [[Ten-pin bowling|bowler]]. He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, after which The Dude learns that a millionaire (also named Jeffrey Lebowski) was the intended victim. The millionaire Lebowski's [[trophy wife]] is kidnapped, and he commissions The Dude to deliver the [[ransom]] to secure her release; the plan goes awry when the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak ([[John Goodman]]) schemes to keep the ransom money. [[Julianne Moore]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[David Huddleston]], [[John Turturro]] and [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] also appear, in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is loosely inspired by the work of [[Raymond Chandler]]. Joel Coen stated, \"We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story \u2013 how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant.\"<ref name=\"The Big Sleep\" /> The [[film score|original score]] was composed by [[Carter Burwell]], a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers.\n\n''The Big Lebowski'' was a disappointment at the U.S. box office and received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Over time, reviews have become largely positive, and the film has become a [[cult film|cult favorite]],<ref name=\"avclub\" /> noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack.<ref name=\"russell\" /> In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]], being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/big-lebowski-ferris-buellers-day-off-added-to-national-film-registry-20141217 |title='Big Lebowski,' 'Ferris Bueller' Added to National Film Registry \u2013 Rolling Stone |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |date=2014-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=New Films Added to National Registry {{!}} News Releases \u2013 Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2014/14-210.html|website = Library of Congress|accessdate = October 1, 2015|date = December 17, 2014}}</ref> A spin-off based on John Turturro's character, titled ''[[The Jesus Rolls]]'', was released in 2019 with Turturro also acting as writer and director.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1991 [[Los Angeles]], Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, a middle-aged [[bachelor]] with a penchant for [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[bowling]], is assaulted by two goons hired by pornographer Jackie Treehorn, demanding money owed by the wife of another Jeffrey Lebowski (the eponymous \"Big Lebowski\"). Realizing they have the wrong man, they leave after one of them urinates on the Dude's rug.\n\nOn the advice of his bowling partners Donny Kerabatsos and [[Vietnam veteran]] Walter Sobchak, the Dude seeks compensation from the other Lebowski, a wealthy, disabled philanthropist who refuses his request. Leaving Lebowski's mansion, the Dude takes a valuable rug and meets Bunny, Lebowski's young [[trophy wife]].\n\nDays later, the Dude is told that Bunny has been kidnapped, and Lebowski wants the Dude to deliver the ransom money to find out if the kidnappers are the same people who peed on his rug. The Dude informs Walter and Donny about the kidnapping and suggests that Bunny may have staged her own kidnapping to use the ransom money to pay off her debts; Walter is immediately convinced of this and becomes incredulous at her greed. That night, another pair of thugs knock the Dude unconscious and take his new rug.\n\nThe kidnappers arrange a meeting, and Walter accompanies the Dude. Still convinced that Bunny \"kidnapped herself\", he enacts a plan to give them another briefcase, containing Walter's \"dirty undies\", so he and the Dude can keep the ransom money. To the Dude's horror, Walter gives the kidnappers the fake briefcase. After another game of bowling, the Dude's car is stolen with the real briefcase inside.\n\nLebowski's daughter Maude calls the Dude, explaining that she took the rug and inviting him to visit her. She plays him a pornographic video revealing Bunny was one of Treehorn's actresses. Confirming the Dude's theory that Bunny staged her own abduction, Maude asks the Dude to recover the ransom which her father withdrew from the family's personal [[foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]]. Lebowski confronts the Dude, angry that he failed to deliver the ransom, and shows him a severed toe presumed to be Bunny's. Three German [[Nihilism|nihilists]] threaten the Dude, identifying themselves as the kidnappers, however Maude says they are friends of Bunny.\n\nThe Dude's car is recovered by police, minus the briefcase, but inside the Dude finds the homework of a high school student named Larry Sellers. Walter and the Dude confront Larry at his family's home, and Walter uses a crowbar to wreck a new sports car parked outside which he believes Larry bought with the stolen money. The car's real owner rushes outside and wrecks the Dude's car in revenge, thinking it to be Walter's.\n\nThe Dude is forcibly brought to Treehorn, who is seeking Bunny and the money she owes him. Treehorn drugs the Dude's [[White Russian (cocktail)|white Russian]] cocktail, causing him to dream about starring in a Treehorn film about bowling with Maude. Awakening in police custody, the Dude is assaulted by the [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] police chief. After being kicked out of a cab for hating the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], the Dude is unknowingly passed by Bunny, revealed to still have all of her toes. The Dude returns home to find his bungalow ransacked by Treehorn's goons. He is seduced by Maude, who hopes to conceive a child but wishes him to have no involvement in its upbringing. She explains that her father has no money of his own, as her late mother left everything to the family charity.\n\nHaving had an epiphany, the Dude has Walter drive him to the Lebowski estate, where Bunny has returned, and the truth of her disappearance is revealed: When Bunny left town on an unannounced trip, her nihilist friends faked her kidnapping to extort money from her husband; Lebowski, who hated his wife, withdrew the ransom from the foundation but kept it for himself, instead giving the Dude a briefcase containing phone books. Walter and the Dude confront Lebowski, who refuses to admit responsibility, so Walter picks him up and throws him out of his wheelchair, thinking he is also faking his paralysis.\n\nThe Dude and his friends return to the bowling alley, where they are confronted by the nihilists. Learning there was never any money, the nihilists try to rob them but Walter violently fends them off. During the scuffle, Donny suffers a fatal heart attack and dies.\n\nSome time later, after delivering an informal eulogy to Donny at the beach, Walter accidentally scatters Donny's ashes onto the Dude. They go bowling, and the Dude encounters the film's cowboy narrator, who tells the audience that Maude is pregnant with a \"little Lebowski\" and hopes that the Dude and Walter will win their upcoming bowling tournament.\n\n== Cast ==\n* {{anchor|Bridges|Dude}}[[Jeff Bridges]] as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski.

S. Callahan, \"Surfing Tropical Beats\", Alison Hodge, 2012, p.133</ref>\n\nAccording to Julianne Moore, the character of Maude was based on artist [[Carolee Schneemann]], \"who worked naked from a swing\", and on [[Yoko Ono]].<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|156}} The character of Jesus Quintana was inspired, in part, by a performance the Coens had seen John Turturro give in 1988, at the Public Theater in a play called ''Mi Puta Vida'' in which he played a [[pederast]]-type character, \"so we thought, let's make Turturro a pederast. It'll be something he can really run with,\" Joel said in an interview.<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|195}}\n\nThe film's overall structure was influenced by the detective fiction of [[Raymond Chandler]]. Ethan said, \"We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling \u2013 like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes.\"<ref name=\"Levine, Josh\" /> The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, \"He is a little bit of an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a [[Mark Twain]].\"<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|169}}\n\nThe significance of the bowling culture was, according to Joel, \"important in reflecting that period at the end of the fifties and the beginning of the sixties. That suited the retro side of the movie, slightly anachronistic, which sent us back to a not-so-far-away era, but one that was well and truly gone nevertheless.\"<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|170}}\n\n=== Screenplay ===\nThe Coen Brothers wrote ''The Big Lebowski'' around the same time as ''[[Barton Fink]]''. When the Coen brothers wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for the ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' television program and Jeff Bridges was making the [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]] film ''Wild Bill''. The Coens decided to make ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' in the meantime.<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|189}} According to Ethan, \"the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter\", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in ''Barton Fink''.<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|169}} They also came up with the idea of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area.<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|41}} When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that ''The Big Lebowski'' \"is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges\".<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|43}} When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often \"encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies.\"<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|171}} In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]], they added an \"effete art-world hanger-on\", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process.<ref name=\"McCarthy, Phillip\" /> In the original script, the Dude's car was a [[Chrysler LeBaron]], as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a [[Ford Torino]].<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|93}}\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment|PolyGram]] and [[Working Title Films]], who had funded ''Fargo'', backed ''The Big Lebowski'' with a budget of $15&nbsp;million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, \"we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's going to play the role. In ''The Big Lebowski'' we did write for John [Goodman] and Steve [Buscemi], but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role.\"<ref name=\"Woods, Paul\" /> In preparation for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually \"drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude.\"<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|188}} The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|27}} He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own.<ref name=\"Carr, Jay\" /> The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|93}} Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the \"Gladiator\" or what they called the \"Chin Strap\" and he thought it would go well with his [[flattop]] haircut.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|32}}\n\nFor the film's look, the Coens wanted to avoid the usual retro 1960s clich\u00e9s like [[lava lamps]], [[blacklight poster|Day-Glo posters]], and [[Grateful Dead]] music<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|95}} and for it to be \"consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy\", Joel said in an interview.<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|191}} For example, the star motif, featured predominantly throughout the film, started with the film's production designer Richard Heinrichs' design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he \"came up with the idea of just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star thing on the interior\". This carried over to the film's dream sequences. \"Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars\", remembers Heinrichs.<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|191}} For Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn's beach party to be [[Inca]]-themed, with a \"very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So there's a very sacrificial quality to it.\"<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|91}}\n\nCinematographer [[Roger Deakins]] discussed the look of the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look.<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|77}} Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|27}} The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]''. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|64}}\n\n=== Principal photography ===\nActual filming took place over an eleven-week period with location shooting in and around Los Angeles, including all of the bowling sequences at the [[Hollywood Star Lanes]] (for three weeks)<ref name=\"Wloszcyna, Susan\" /> and the Dude's [[Busby Berkeley]] dream sequences in a converted airplane hangar.<ref name=\"Levine, Josh\" /> According to Joel, the only time they ever directed Bridges \"was when he would come over at the beginning of each scene and ask, 'Do you think the Dude burned one on the way over?' I'd reply 'Yes' usually, so Jeff would go over in the corner and start rubbing his eyes to get them bloodshot.\"<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|195}} Julianne Moore was sent the script while working on ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]''. She worked only two weeks on the film, early and late during the production that went from January to April 1997<ref name=\"Arnold, Gary\" /> while Sam Elliott was only on set for two days and did many takes of his final speech.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|46}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe scenes in Jackie Treehorn's house were shot in the [[Sheats-Goldstein Residence]], designed by John Lautner and built in 1963 in the Hollywood Hills.<ref name=\"AutoTR-1\" />\n\nDeakins described the look of the fantasy scenes as being very crisp, monochromatic, and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus. However, with the Dude's apartment, Deakins said, \"it's kind of seedy and the light's pretty nasty\" with a grittier look. The visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp look, he used an orange sodium-light effect.<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|79}} The Coen brothers shot a lot of the film with wide-angle lens because, according to Joel, it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic.<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|82}}\n\nTo achieve the point-of-view of a rolling bowling ball the Coen brothers mounted a camera \"on something like a barbecue spit\", according to Ethan, and then dollied it along the lane. The challenge for them was figuring out the relative speeds of the forward motion and the rotating motion. [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] was used to create the vantage point of the thumb hole in the bowling ball.<ref name=\"Arnold, Gary\" />\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Big Lebowski: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = February 24, 1998\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Rock music|Rock]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[Country music|country]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Pop music|pop]]\n| length     = 51:46\n| label      = [[Mercury Records|Mercury]]\n| producer   = [[T-Bone Burnett]], [[Joel Coen]], [[Ethan Coen]]\n| chronology = [[Coen Brothers]] film soundtracks\n| prev_title = [[Fargo (soundtrack)|Fargo]]\n| prev_year  = 1996\n| next_title = [[O Brother, Where Art Thou?

While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had [[Kenny Rogers]]' \"Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was in)\", the [[Gipsy Kings]]' cover of \"[[Hotel California]]\", and several [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] songs in mind.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> They asked [[T-Bone Burnett]] (who would later work with the Coens on ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' and ''[[Inside Llewyn Davis]]'') to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, \"T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac.\"<ref name=\"Altman\" /> Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Moondog]] and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Man in Me]]\".<ref name=\"Greene\" /> However, he had a tough time securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of [[the Rolling Stones]]' \"Dead Flowers\", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager [[Allen Klein]] owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, \"It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], man!' Klein stands up and says, 'That's it, you can have the song!' That was beautiful.\"<ref name=\"Greene\" /><ref name=\"flowers\" /> Burnett was going to be credited on the film as \"Music Supervisor\", but asked his credit to be \"Music Archivist\" because he \"hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to think of me as management\".<ref name=\"Altman\" />\n\nFor Joel, \"the original music, as with other elements of the movie, had to echo the retro sounds of the Sixties and early Seventies\".<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|156}} Music defines each character. For example, \"[[Tumbling Tumbleweeds]]\" by Bob Nolan was chosen for the Stranger at the time the Coens wrote the screenplay, as was \"Lujon\" by [[Henry Mancini]] for Jackie Treehorn. \"The German nihilists are accompanied by techno-pop and Jeff Bridges by Creedence. So there's a musical signature for each of them\", remarked Ethan in an interview.<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|156}}\nThe character Uli Kunkel was in the German electronic band Autobahn, an homage to the band [[Kraftwerk]]. The album cover of their record ''Nagelbett'' (''bed of nails'') is a parody of the Kraftwerk album cover for ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and the group name Autobahn shares the name of a Kraftwerk [[Autobahn (song)|song]] and [[Autobahn (album)|album]]. In the lyrics the phrase \"We believe in nothing\" is repeated with electronic distortion. This is a reference to Autobahn's nihilism in the film.<ref name=\"burwell\" />\n{{tracklist\n|extra_column= Performer\n|title1= [[The Man in Me]]\n|writer1= [[Bob Dylan]]\n|extra1= Dylan\n|title2= [[Clear Spot|Her Eyes Are a Blue Million Miles]]\n|writer2= [[Captain Beefheart]]\n|extra2= Beefheart\n|title3= My Mood Swings\n|writer3= [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Cait O'Riordan]]\n|extra3= Costello\n|title4= [[Voice of the Xtabay|Ataypura]]\n|writer4= Moises Vivanco\n|extra4= [[Yma Sumac]]\n|title5= Traffic Boom\n|writer5= [[Piero Piccioni]]\n|extra5= Piccioni\n|title6= I Got It Bad & That Ain't Good\n|writer6= [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Paul Francis Webster]]\n|extra6= [[Nina Simone]]\n|title7= Stamping Ground\n|note7= The track actually includes two songs, starting with \"Theme\", which then leads to \"Stamping Ground\"\n|writer7= [[Moondog]]\n|extra7= Moondog\n|title8= [[Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)]]\n|writer8= [[Mickey Newbury]]\n|extra8= [[Kenny Rogers]] & [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]]\n|title9= Walking Song\n|writer9= [[Meredith Monk]]\n|extra9= Monk\n|title10= [[Gl\u00fcck das mir verblieb]]\n|note10=from ''[[Die tote Stadt]]&thinsp;''\n|writer10= [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]\n|extra10= Ilona Steingruber, [[Anton Dermota]] and the Austrian State Radio Orchestra\n|title11= [[Lujon]]\n|writer11= [[Henry Mancini]]\n|extra11= Mancini\n|title12= [[Hotel California]]\n|writer12= [[Don Henley]], [[Glenn Frey]] and [[Don Felder]]\n|extra12= The [[Gipsy Kings]]\n|title13= Technopop\n|note13=Wie Glauben\n|writer13= [[Carter Burwell]]\n|extra13= Burwell\n|title14= [[Dead Flowers (Rolling Stones song)|Dead Flowers]]\n|writer14= [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]]\n|extra14= [[Townes Van Zandt]]\n}}\n{{tracklist\n|headline= Other music used (not on soundtrack album)\n|collapsed= yes\n|extra_column= Performer\n|title1= [[Tumbling Tumbleweeds]]\n|writer1= [[Bob Nolan]]\n|extra1= [[Sons of the Pioneers]]\n|title2= Mucha Muchacha\n|writer2= [[Juan Garc\u00eda Esquivel]]\n|extra2= Esquivel\n|title3= I Hate You\n|writer3= Gary Burger, David Havlicek, Roger Johnston, Thomas E.

It stars [[Jeff Bridges]] as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, a [[Los Angeles]] [[slacker]] and avid [[Ten-pin bowling|bowler]]. He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, after which The Dude learns that a millionaire (also named Jeffrey Lebowski) was the intended victim. The millionaire Lebowski's [[trophy wife]] is kidnapped, and he commissions The Dude to deliver the [[ransom]] to secure her release; the plan goes awry when the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak ([[John Goodman]]) schemes to keep the ransom money. [[Julianne Moore]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[David Huddleston]], [[John Turturro]] and [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] also appear, in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is loosely inspired by the work of [[Raymond Chandler]]. Joel Coen stated, \"We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story \u2013 how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant.\"<ref name=\"The Big Sleep\" /> The [[film score|original score]] was composed by [[Carter Burwell]], a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers.\n\n''The Big Lebowski'' was a disappointment at the U.S. box office and received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Over time, reviews have become largely positive, and the film has become a [[cult film|cult favorite]],<ref name=\"avclub\" /> noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack.<ref name=\"russell\" /> In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]], being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/big-lebowski-ferris-buellers-day-off-added-to-national-film-registry-20141217 |title='Big Lebowski,' 'Ferris Bueller' Added to National Film Registry \u2013 Rolling Stone |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |date=2014-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=New Films Added to National Registry {{!}} News Releases \u2013 Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2014/14-210.html|website = Library of Congress|accessdate = October 1, 2015|date = December 17, 2014}}</ref> A spin-off based on John Turturro's character, titled ''[[The Jesus Rolls]]'', was released in 2019 with Turturro also acting as writer and director.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1991 [[Los Angeles]], Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, a middle-aged [[bachelor]] with a penchant for [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[bowling]], is assaulted by two goons hired by pornographer Jackie Treehorn, demanding money owed by the wife of another Jeffrey Lebowski (the eponymous \"Big Lebowski\"). Realizing they have the wrong man, they leave after one of them urinates on the Dude's rug.\n\nOn the advice of his bowling partners Donny Kerabatsos and [[Vietnam veteran]] Walter Sobchak, the Dude seeks compensation from the other Lebowski, a wealthy, disabled philanthropist who refuses his request. Leaving Lebowski's mansion, the Dude takes a valuable rug and meets Bunny, Lebowski's young [[trophy wife]].\n\nDays later, the Dude is told that Bunny has been kidnapped, and Lebowski wants the Dude to deliver the ransom money to find out if the kidnappers are the same people who peed on his rug. The Dude informs Walter and Donny about the kidnapping and suggests that Bunny may have staged her own kidnapping to use the ransom money to pay off her debts; Walter is immediately convinced of this and becomes incredulous at her greed. That night, another pair of thugs knock the Dude unconscious and take his new rug.\n\nThe kidnappers arrange a meeting, and Walter accompanies the Dude. Still convinced that Bunny \"kidnapped herself\", he enacts a plan to give them another briefcase, containing Walter's \"dirty undies\", so he and the Dude can keep the ransom money. To the Dude's horror, Walter gives the kidnappers the fake briefcase. After another game of bowling, the Dude's car is stolen with the real briefcase inside.\n\nLebowski's daughter Maude calls the Dude, explaining that she took the rug and inviting him to visit her. She plays him a pornographic video revealing Bunny was one of Treehorn's actresses. Confirming the Dude's theory that Bunny staged her own abduction, Maude asks the Dude to recover the ransom which her father withdrew from the family's personal [[foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]]. Lebowski confronts the Dude, angry that he failed to deliver the ransom, and shows him a severed toe presumed to be Bunny's. Three German [[Nihilism|nihilists]] threaten the Dude, identifying themselves as the kidnappers, however Maude says they are friends of Bunny.\n\nThe Dude's car is recovered by police, minus the briefcase, but inside the Dude finds the homework of a high school student named Larry Sellers. Walter and the Dude confront Larry at his family's home, and Walter uses a crowbar to wreck a new sports car parked outside which he believes Larry bought with the stolen money. The car's real owner rushes outside and wrecks the Dude's car in revenge, thinking it to be Walter's.\n\nThe Dude is forcibly brought to Treehorn, who is seeking Bunny and the money she owes him. Treehorn drugs the Dude's [[White Russian (cocktail)|white Russian]] cocktail, causing him to dream about starring in a Treehorn film about bowling with Maude. Awakening in police custody, the Dude is assaulted by the [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] police chief. After being kicked out of a cab for hating the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], the Dude is unknowingly passed by Bunny, revealed to still have all of her toes. The Dude returns home to find his bungalow ransacked by Treehorn's goons. He is seduced by Maude, who hopes to conceive a child but wishes him to have no involvement in its upbringing. She explains that her father has no money of his own, as her late mother left everything to the family charity.\n\nHaving had an epiphany, the Dude has Walter drive him to the Lebowski estate, where Bunny has returned, and the truth of her disappearance is revealed: When Bunny left town on an unannounced trip, her nihilist friends faked her kidnapping to extort money from her husband; Lebowski, who hated his wife, withdrew the ransom from the foundation but kept it for himself, instead giving the Dude a briefcase containing phone books. Walter and the Dude confront Lebowski, who refuses to admit responsibility, so Walter picks him up and throws him out of his wheelchair, thinking he is also faking his paralysis.\n\nThe Dude and his friends return to the bowling alley, where they are confronted by the nihilists. Learning there was never any money, the nihilists try to rob them but Walter violently fends them off. During the scuffle, Donny suffers a fatal heart attack and dies.\n\nSome time later, after delivering an informal eulogy to Donny at the beach, Walter accidentally scatters Donny's ashes onto the Dude. They go bowling, and the Dude encounters the film's cowboy narrator, who tells the audience that Maude is pregnant with a \"little Lebowski\" and hopes that the Dude and Walter will win their upcoming bowling tournament.\n\n== Cast ==\n* {{anchor|Bridges|Dude}}[[Jeff Bridges]] as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski.

S. Callahan, \"Surfing Tropical Beats\", Alison Hodge, 2012, p.133</ref>\n\nAccording to Julianne Moore, the character of Maude was based on artist [[Carolee Schneemann]], \"who worked naked from a swing\", and on [[Yoko Ono]].<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|156}} The character of Jesus Quintana was inspired, in part, by a performance the Coens had seen John Turturro give in 1988, at the Public Theater in a play called ''Mi Puta Vida'' in which he played a [[pederast]]-type character, \"so we thought, let's make Turturro a pederast. It'll be something he can really run with,\" Joel said in an interview.<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|195}}\n\nThe film's overall structure was influenced by the detective fiction of [[Raymond Chandler]]. Ethan said, \"We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling \u2013 like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes.\"<ref name=\"Levine, Josh\" /> The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, \"He is a little bit of an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a [[Mark Twain]].\"<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|169}}\n\nThe significance of the bowling culture was, according to Joel, \"important in reflecting that period at the end of the fifties and the beginning of the sixties. That suited the retro side of the movie, slightly anachronistic, which sent us back to a not-so-far-away era, but one that was well and truly gone nevertheless.\"<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|170}}\n\n=== Screenplay ===\nThe Coen Brothers wrote ''The Big Lebowski'' around the same time as ''[[Barton Fink]]''. When the Coen brothers wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for the ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' television program and Jeff Bridges was making the [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]] film ''Wild Bill''. The Coens decided to make ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' in the meantime.<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|189}} According to Ethan, \"the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter\", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in ''Barton Fink''.<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|169}} They also came up with the idea of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area.<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|41}} When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that ''The Big Lebowski'' \"is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges\".<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|43}} When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often \"encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies.\"<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|171}} In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]], they added an \"effete art-world hanger-on\", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process.<ref name=\"McCarthy, Phillip\" /> In the original script, the Dude's car was a [[Chrysler LeBaron]], as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a [[Ford Torino]].<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|93}}\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment|PolyGram]] and [[Working Title Films]], who had funded ''Fargo'', backed ''The Big Lebowski'' with a budget of $15&nbsp;million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, \"we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's going to play the role. In ''The Big Lebowski'' we did write for John [Goodman] and Steve [Buscemi], but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role.\"<ref name=\"Woods, Paul\" /> In preparation for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually \"drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude.\"<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|188}} The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|27}} He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own.<ref name=\"Carr, Jay\" /> The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|93}} Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the \"Gladiator\" or what they called the \"Chin Strap\" and he thought it would go well with his [[flattop]] haircut.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|32}}\n\nFor the film's look, the Coens wanted to avoid the usual retro 1960s clich\u00e9s like [[lava lamps]], [[blacklight poster|Day-Glo posters]], and [[Grateful Dead]] music<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|95}} and for it to be \"consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy\", Joel said in an interview.<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|191}} For example, the star motif, featured predominantly throughout the film, started with the film's production designer Richard Heinrichs' design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he \"came up with the idea of just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star thing on the interior\". This carried over to the film's dream sequences. \"Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars\", remembers Heinrichs.<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|191}} For Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn's beach party to be [[Inca]]-themed, with a \"very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So there's a very sacrificial quality to it.\"<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|91}}\n\nCinematographer [[Roger Deakins]] discussed the look of the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look.<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|77}} Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|27}} The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]''. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|64}}\n\n=== Principal photography ===\nActual filming took place over an eleven-week period with location shooting in and around Los Angeles, including all of the bowling sequences at the [[Hollywood Star Lanes]] (for three weeks)<ref name=\"Wloszcyna, Susan\" /> and the Dude's [[Busby Berkeley]] dream sequences in a converted airplane hangar.<ref name=\"Levine, Josh\" /> According to Joel, the only time they ever directed Bridges \"was when he would come over at the beginning of each scene and ask, 'Do you think the Dude burned one on the way over?' I'd reply 'Yes' usually, so Jeff would go over in the corner and start rubbing his eyes to get them bloodshot.\"<ref name=\"Bergan, Ronald\" />{{rp|195}} Julianne Moore was sent the script while working on ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]''. She worked only two weeks on the film, early and late during the production that went from January to April 1997<ref name=\"Arnold, Gary\" /> while Sam Elliott was only on set for two days and did many takes of his final speech.<ref name=\"Green, Bill\" />{{rp|46}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe scenes in Jackie Treehorn's house were shot in the [[Sheats-Goldstein Residence]], designed by John Lautner and built in 1963 in the Hollywood Hills.<ref name=\"AutoTR-1\" />\n\nDeakins described the look of the fantasy scenes as being very crisp, monochromatic, and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus. However, with the Dude's apartment, Deakins said, \"it's kind of seedy and the light's pretty nasty\" with a grittier look. The visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp look, he used an orange sodium-light effect.<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|79}} The Coen brothers shot a lot of the film with wide-angle lens because, according to Joel, it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic.<ref name=\"Robertson, William\" />{{rp|82}}\n\nTo achieve the point-of-view of a rolling bowling ball the Coen brothers mounted a camera \"on something like a barbecue spit\", according to Ethan, and then dollied it along the lane. The challenge for them was figuring out the relative speeds of the forward motion and the rotating motion. [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] was used to create the vantage point of the thumb hole in the bowling ball.<ref name=\"Arnold, Gary\" />\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Big Lebowski: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = February 24, 1998\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Rock music|Rock]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[Country music|country]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Pop music|pop]]\n| length     = 51:46\n| label      = [[Mercury Records|Mercury]]\n| producer   = [[T-Bone Burnett]], [[Joel Coen]], [[Ethan Coen]]\n| chronology = [[Coen Brothers]] film soundtracks\n| prev_title = [[Fargo (soundtrack)|Fargo]]\n| prev_year  = 1996\n| next_title = [[O Brother, Where Art Thou?

While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had [[Kenny Rogers]]' \"Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was in)\", the [[Gipsy Kings]]' cover of \"[[Hotel California]]\", and several [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] songs in mind.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> They asked [[T-Bone Burnett]] (who would later work with the Coens on ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' and ''[[Inside Llewyn Davis]]'') to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, \"T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac.\"<ref name=\"Altman\" /> Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Moondog]] and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Man in Me]]\".<ref name=\"Greene\" /> However, he had a tough time securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of [[the Rolling Stones]]' \"Dead Flowers\", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager [[Allen Klein]] owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, \"It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], man!' Klein stands up and says, 'That's it, you can have the song!' That was beautiful.\"<ref name=\"Greene\" /><ref name=\"flowers\" /> Burnett was going to be credited on the film as \"Music Supervisor\", but asked his credit to be \"Music Archivist\" because he \"hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to think of me as management\".<ref name=\"Altman\" />\n\nFor Joel, \"the original music, as with other elements of the movie, had to echo the retro sounds of the Sixties and early Seventies\".<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|156}} Music defines each character. For example, \"[[Tumbling Tumbleweeds]]\" by Bob Nolan was chosen for the Stranger at the time the Coens wrote the screenplay, as was \"Lujon\" by [[Henry Mancini]] for Jackie Treehorn. \"The German nihilists are accompanied by techno-pop and Jeff Bridges by Creedence. So there's a musical signature for each of them\", remarked Ethan in an interview.<ref name=\"Ciment, Michel\" />{{rp|156}}\nThe character Uli Kunkel was in the German electronic band Autobahn, an homage to the band [[Kraftwerk]]. The album cover of their record ''Nagelbett'' (''bed of nails'') is a parody of the Kraftwerk album cover for ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and the group name Autobahn shares the name of a Kraftwerk [[Autobahn (song)|song]] and [[Autobahn (album)|album]]. In the lyrics the phrase \"We believe in nothing\" is repeated with electronic distortion. This is a reference to Autobahn's nihilism in the film.<ref name=\"burwell\" />\n{{tracklist\n|extra_column= Performer\n|title1= [[The Man in Me]]\n|writer1= [[Bob Dylan]]\n|extra1= Dylan\n|title2= [[Clear Spot|Her Eyes Are a Blue Million Miles]]\n|writer2= [[Captain Beefheart]]\n|extra2= Beefheart\n|title3= My Mood Swings\n|writer3= [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Cait O'Riordan]]\n|extra3= Costello\n|title4= [[Voice of the Xtabay|Ataypura]]\n|writer4= Moises Vivanco\n|extra4= [[Yma Sumac]]\n|title5= Traffic Boom\n|writer5= [[Piero Piccioni]]\n|extra5= Piccioni\n|title6= I Got It Bad & That Ain't Good\n|writer6= [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Paul Francis Webster]]\n|extra6= [[Nina Simone]]\n|title7= Stamping Ground\n|note7= The track actually includes two songs, starting with \"Theme\", which then leads to \"Stamping Ground\"\n|writer7= [[Moondog]]\n|extra7= Moondog\n|title8= [[Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)]]\n|writer8= [[Mickey Newbury]]\n|extra8= [[Kenny Rogers]] & [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]]\n|title9= Walking Song\n|writer9= [[Meredith Monk]]\n|extra9= Monk\n|title10= [[Gl\u00fcck das mir verblieb]]\n|note10=from ''[[Die tote Stadt]]&thinsp;''\n|writer10= [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]\n|extra10= Ilona Steingruber, [[Anton Dermota]] and the Austrian State Radio Orchestra\n|title11= [[Lujon]]\n|writer11= [[Henry Mancini]]\n|extra11= Mancini\n|title12= [[Hotel California]]\n|writer12= [[Don Henley]], [[Glenn Frey]] and [[Don Felder]]\n|extra12= The [[Gipsy Kings]]\n|title13= Technopop\n|note13=Wie Glauben\n|writer13= [[Carter Burwell]]\n|extra13= Burwell\n|title14= [[Dead Flowers (Rolling Stones song)|Dead Flowers]]\n|writer14= [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]]\n|extra14= [[Townes Van Zandt]]\n}}\n{{tracklist\n|headline= Other music used (not on soundtrack album)\n|collapsed= yes\n|extra_column= Performer\n|title1= [[Tumbling Tumbleweeds]]\n|writer1= [[Bob Nolan]]\n|extra1= [[Sons of the Pioneers]]\n|title2= Mucha Muchacha\n|writer2= [[Juan Garc\u00eda Esquivel]]\n|extra2= Esquivel\n|title3= I Hate You\n|writer3= Gary Burger, David Havlicek, Roger Johnston, Thomas E.
