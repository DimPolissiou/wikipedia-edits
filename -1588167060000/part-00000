Both will be available in Onyx Black (glossy) and Glacial Green (matte), while the 8 Pro has its own Ultramarine Blue (matte) finish. The 8 has two additional colors, a Polar Silver (matte) finish exclusive to the Verizon model,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> and an Interstellar Glow (glossy) finish exclusive to the T-Mobile model.\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth#Deep color (30/36/48-bit)|30-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera or autofocus on the ultrawide camera, which are now exclusive to the 8 Pro. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nBoth the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the design, display, performance and battery life.

The 8 has two additional colors, a Polar Silver (matte) finish exclusive to the Verizon model,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> and an Interstellar Glow (glossy) finish exclusive to the T-Mobile model.\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth#Deep color (30/36/48-bit)|30-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera or autofocus on the ultrawide camera, which are now exclusive to the 8 Pro. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nBoth the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the design, display, performance and battery life.

The 86ers however came up short in the first round of the 1992 [[Professional Cup]] North American Club Championship. Facing APSL champions [[Colorado Foxes]] over two legs, Vancouver suffered a heartbreaking 3\u20132 defeat in the first leg in Colorado on August 3, 1992, before the Foxes advanced to the final, as a 2\u20131 second-leg win at Swangard on August 11, 1992, secured a 5\u20133 aggregate victory for Colorado.  Vancouver played in the CSL from its inception in 1987 until the league folded in 1992, and then moved over to the APSL in 1993 which was later absorbed into the USL hierarchy of leagues in 1997 becoming the [[American Professional Soccer League|A-League]], later renamed the [[USL First Division|USL]].\n\n===Vancouver Whitecaps (USL)===\n[[Image:Vancouver-Whitecaps-FC-Logo.svg|150px|logo|thumb|right|Vancouver Whitecaps USL]]\nIn 2001, the team began to use the old Vancouver Whitecaps moniker (signifying both the 'white caps' of the nearby mountains, and the waves of the [[Pacific Ocean]]). \nIn 2003, the name was again changed, albeit only slightly, to Whitecaps FC, which encompasses the men's, women's, and youth development teams within the organization. At this time, the Whitecaps logo changed slightly in colour (the light teal-green was replaced with a brighter blue) and the word \"Vancouver\" was dropped from the image.\n\nIn 2006, the Whitecaps organization won an unprecedented double-championship, claiming both the [[USL First Division|United Soccer Leagues First Division]] championship trophy, defeating the host [[Rochester Rhinos]] 3\u20130 at PAETEC Park, and winning the W-League women's trophy. The men's team also won the Nation's Cup, a new tournament established by their club as a way to feature the Whitecaps playing against international competition. The 2006 Nation's Cup tournament featured the Chinese and Indian U-20 National teams and [[Football League Championship|Championship]] Welsh club [[Cardiff City F.C.]] (the \"Bluebirds\"). The gradually added the \"Vancouver\" back into their name, changing it officially to \"Vancouver Whitecaps FC\".\n\nThe following season, the Whitecaps signed a deal to play an exhibition match against the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], which featured international [[David Beckham]], and promoted Director of Soccer Operations [[Bob Lenarduzzi]] to team president.\n\nOctober 12, 2008, they claimed their second United Soccer Leagues First Division championship with a 2\u20131 victory over the [[Puerto Rico Islanders]].

The new stadium was to be built over the railway tracks east of [[Waterfront Station (Vancouver)|Waterfront Station]] on Burrard Inlet.\n\nThis 16,000 seat stadium would have replaced [[Swangard Stadium]] as the home field for the [[USL First Division|USL]]'s Vancouver Whitecaps.\n\nThere was a fair degree of controversy with regards to this location; a Vancouver council session to debate the issue was extended to four nights to allow public input. Detractors viewed the proposed stadium as an incongruous addition to nearby historic [[Gastown]] that would block waterfront access and promote piecemeal development of the area. Proponents of the development felt that the stadium would attract new business to the downtown and Gastown areas, particularly since the soccer team tended to attract a family-oriented audience.\n\nOn July 11, 2006, [[Vancouver City Council]] voted unanimously to proceed with the stadium project, so long as the Whitecaps could meet certain conditions regarding land use. On January 22, 2007, the Whitecaps filed a new proposal shifting the proposed site for the stadium project to the current location of the SeaBus terminal, a short distance northwest of the previous site.\n\nWith the Whitecaps moving up to MLS, the franchise has signed to initially play at [[Empire Field]], and then [[BC Place Stadium]] from 2011 to at least 2015. It was hoped that the new facility would be completed by the 2016 MLS season. Due the hurdles of getting the new stadium approved, the project has been abandoned with the team committed to playing at [[BC Place Stadium]].\n\n==Club culture==\n\n===Mascot===\n\nThe Whitecaps' mascot was named Winger. He is a bird who wears a Whitecaps jersey and carries a large drum to encourage the crowd. He often uses signs to get fans in the grandstands to cheer.\n\n===Fans===\n{{details|Vancouver Southsiders}}\n\nThe Whitecaps have an independent supporters group known as the ''[[Vancouver Southsiders|Southsiders]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100224082627/http://www.whitecapsfc.com/matchday/supporters/ The Official Supporters Group of The Vancouver Whitecaps (USSF D2)]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversouthsiders.com |title=Vancouver Southsiders |publisher=Vancouver Southsiders |date= |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref> Founded in 1999, the group is named for their preferred seating area in the south end of Swangard Stadium.

The name was changed to \"The Canterbury Chorus\" for the subsequent season, as the beer sponsorship had changed between seasons.

These three teams competed in the yearly [[Cascadia Cup]] through 2008. In 2009, the Cup involved only the Whitecaps and Timbers because the Sounders were replaced by [[Seattle Sounders FC|an MLS team of the same name]].\n\nThe Whitecaps also compete on a yearly basis with the [[Montreal Impact]] and [[Toronto FC]] for the [[Voyageurs Cup]] or [[Canadian Championship]].

The team played its home games at [[Swangard Stadium]] in nearby [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]]. The team's colours were blue and white.\n\nOn March 19, 2009, an ownership group led by principal Greg Kerfoot was granted a [[Major League Soccer]] expansion franchise which began play in 2011 under the name [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]].\n\nIn addition to its men's side the Whitecaps also field a [[Vancouver Whitecaps Women|women's team]] in the [[USL W-League]], two developmental teams ([[Vancouver Whitecaps Residency]], in the [[USL Premier Development League]], and the [[Whitecaps FC Prospects]], in the [[Pacific Coast Soccer League]]), and four youth teams in the USL [[Super Y-League]] ([[Whitecaps FC Academy|Coastal WFC, Mountain WFC, Surrey WFC and Okanagan WFC]]) ranging in age from U13 to U17 for both boys and girls.<ref>[http://www.whitecapsfc.com/youth/teams/super_y_affiliates/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915075213/http://www.whitecapsfc.com/youth/teams/super_y_affiliates/ |date=September 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe team was previously known as the '''Vancouver 86ers''' of both the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]], [[American Professional Soccer League]] (APSL), and later the [[A-League (1995\u20132004)|A-League]].

The 86ers went on to finish second in the Western Division standings that year before bowing out to inaugural league champions [[Calgary Kickers]] in the playoff semifinals. The 86ers played in the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]] (CSL) winning four straight CSL Championships (1988\u20131991) and five consecutive CSL regular-season first-place finishes (1988\u201392).\n\nIn 1988\u20131989, the team, coached by [[Bob Lenarduzzi]], set a North American professional sports record by playing 46 consecutive games without a loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcsportshalloffame.com/inductees/inductees/bio?id=44&type=team|title=2004 Team Induction&nbsp;\u2013 1989 Vancouver 86ers|work=BC Sports Hall of Fame|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref>  Also in 1988 the Vancouver 86ers and Calgary Kickers played six friendly matches each against the [[Western Soccer Alliance]] in the month of May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://a-leaguearchive.tripod.com/1988/resultswsa88.htm |title=WSA 1988 Season |publisher=A-leaguearchive.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, the Vancouver 86ers captured the North American Club Championship after defeating the [[Maryland Bays]] 3\u20132 in the final played in Burnaby. The game was played between the champions of the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987\u20131992)|Canadian Soccer League]] and the champions of the [[American Professional Soccer League]] (APSL).   The 86ers however came up short in the first round of the 1992 [[Professional Cup]] North American Club Championship. Facing APSL champions [[Colorado Foxes]] over two legs, Vancouver suffered a heartbreaking 3\u20132 defeat in the first leg in Colorado on August 3, 1992, before the Foxes advanced to the final, as a 2\u20131 second-leg win at Swangard on August 11, 1992, secured a 5\u20133 aggregate victory for Colorado.  Vancouver played in the CSL from its inception in 1987 until the league folded in 1992, and then moved over to the APSL in 1993 which was later absorbed into the USL hierarchy of leagues in 1997 becoming the [[American Professional Soccer League|A-League]], later renamed the [[USL First Division|USL]].\n\n===Vancouver Whitecaps (USL)===\n[[Image:Vancouver-Whitecaps-FC-Logo.svg|150px|logo|thumb|right|Vancouver Whitecaps USL]]\nIn 2001, the team began to use the old Vancouver Whitecaps moniker (signifying both the 'white caps' of the nearby mountains, and the waves of the [[Pacific Ocean]]). \nIn 2003, the name was again changed, albeit only slightly, to Whitecaps FC, which encompasses the men's, women's, and youth development teams within the organization. At this time, the Whitecaps logo changed slightly in colour (the light teal-green was replaced with a brighter blue) and the word \"Vancouver\" was dropped from the image.\n\nIn 2006, the Whitecaps organization won an unprecedented double-championship, claiming both the [[USL First Division|United Soccer Leagues First Division]] championship trophy, defeating the host [[Rochester Rhinos]] 3\u20130 at PAETEC Park, and winning the W-League women's trophy.

The new stadium was to be built over the railway tracks east of [[Waterfront Station (Vancouver)|Waterfront Station]] on Burrard Inlet.\n\nThis 16,000 seat stadium would have replaced [[Swangard Stadium]] as the home field for the [[USL First Division|USL]]'s Vancouver Whitecaps.\n\nThere was a fair degree of controversy with regards to this location; a Vancouver council session to debate the issue was extended to four nights to allow public input. Detractors viewed the proposed stadium as an incongruous addition to nearby historic [[Gastown]] that would block waterfront access and promote piecemeal development of the area. Proponents of the development felt that the stadium would attract new business to the downtown and Gastown areas, particularly since the soccer team tended to attract a family-oriented audience.\n\nOn July 11, 2006, [[Vancouver City Council]] voted unanimously to proceed with the stadium project, so long as the Whitecaps could meet certain conditions regarding land use. On January 22, 2007, the Whitecaps filed a new proposal shifting the proposed site for the stadium project to the current location of the SeaBus terminal, a short distance northwest of the previous site.\n\nWith the Whitecaps moving up to MLS, the franchise has signed to initially play at [[Empire Field]], and then [[BC Place Stadium]] from 2011 to at least 2015. It was hoped that the new facility would be completed by the 2016 MLS season. Due the hurdles of getting the new stadium approved, the project has been abandoned with the team committed to playing at [[BC Place Stadium]].\n\n==Club culture==\n\n===Mascot===\n\nThe Whitecaps' mascot was named Winger. He is a bird who wears a Whitecaps jersey and carries a large drum to encourage the crowd. He often uses signs to get fans in the grandstands to cheer.\n\n===Fans===\n{{details|Vancouver Southsiders}}\n\nThe Whitecaps have an independent supporters group known as the ''[[Vancouver Southsiders|Southsiders]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100224082627/http://www.whitecapsfc.com/matchday/supporters/ The Official Supporters Group of The Vancouver Whitecaps (USSF D2)]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversouthsiders.com |title=Vancouver Southsiders |publisher=Vancouver Southsiders |date= |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref> Founded in 1999, the group is named for their preferred seating area in the south end of Swangard Stadium.

The name was changed to \"The Canterbury Chorus\" for the subsequent season, as the beer sponsorship had changed between seasons. To avoid changing names every time the sponsor changed, the group chose the name \"The Southsiders\".<ref>[http://www.vancouversouthsiders.ca/history.html/, The Southsiders Official Homepage.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722215059/http://vancouversouthsiders.ca/history.html/, |date=July 22, 2012 }} Retrieved on July 22, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Rival clubs===\nThe Vancouver Whitecaps have two historic rivals, the Pacific Northwest [[Portland Timbers (2001\u201310)|Portland Timbers]] and [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]]. These three teams competed in the yearly [[Cascadia Cup]] through 2008. In 2009, the Cup involved only the Whitecaps and Timbers because the Sounders were replaced by [[Seattle Sounders FC|an MLS team of the same name]].\n\nThe Whitecaps also compete on a yearly basis with the [[Montreal Impact]] and [[Toronto FC]] for the [[Voyageurs Cup]] or [[Canadian Championship]]. The winner of this series advances to the [[CONCACAF Champions League]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|1=http://www.whitecapsfc.com}}\n\n{{Vancouver Whitecaps FC}}\n{{USSFD2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vancouver Whitecaps Fc}}\n[[Category:A-League (1995\u20132004) teams]]\n[[Category:American Professional Soccer League teams based in Canada]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1986]]\n[[Category:Canadian Soccer League (1986\u20131992) teams]]\n[[Category:Former USL First Division teams]]\n[[Category:United Soccer League teams based in Canada]]\n[[Category:Vancouver Whitecaps (1986\u20132010)| ]]\n[[Category:1986 establishments in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:2010 disestablishments in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2010]]\n\n[[da:Vancouver Whitecaps]]\n[[it:Vancouver Whitecaps]]\n", "name_user": "Jellyman", "label": "safe", "comment": "removed additional links from hatnote as perWP:HATEXTRA", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Whitecaps_(1986%E2%80%932010)"}

Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

The Asylum, initially called Montrose Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary  was founded by Susan Carnegie of Charleton to treat both paupers and private patients and was originally situated on Montrose Links. It was granted a Royal Charter in 1810. In 1858 it moved to Sunnyside farm at the nearby village of Hillside. Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory).

Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

While manufacturing remains important to the economy of the region, the manufacturing sector has experienced a significant decline since 2000 as a result of unfavourable currency exchange rates, increasing energy costs, and reduced demand from the United States, which is by far the largest market for Ontario's goods.\n\nThe [[Hamilton-Oshawa Port Authority|Port of Hamilton]] and the [[PortsToronto|Port of Toronto]] are the two largest [[Port#Seaport|seaports]] on [[Lake Ontario]]. The [[Welland Canal]] system handles tanker ship and recreational traffic through the Great Lakes. Large rail and truck distribution facilities are located in Toronto, [[Vaughan]] and Brampton. Food processing is also a key ingredient in the economy. \n[[File:Wine grapes nearing harvest in Ontario-also example of trellis wire.jpg|thumb|The [[Niagara Peninsula]] is Canada's largest wine growing region and a major producer of [[Ontario wine]].]]\nNiagara Falls has one of the world's largest per-capita tourist economies, benefiting from millions of tourists coming to see its majestic waterfalls, shop in its numerous stores, and visit its many attractions. The winemaking and fruit growing industries of the [[Niagara Peninsula]] produce award-winning wines, which are beginning to attract attention around the world, in particular, the [[ice wine]] for which the region is known.\n\nAs of 2014, sectors such as [[information technology]], health care, Agtech, tourism, research and finance provide the bulk of growth in the Golden Horseshoe. The suburban cities within [[Greater Toronto]], such as [[Brampton]], [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Waterloo Region]] and [[Mississauga]], are emerging as hubs for technology and innovation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brampton.ca/EN/Business/economic-development/Key-Sectors/Pages/Innovation-and-Technology.aspx|title=Innovation & Technology|website=www.brampton.ca}}</ref> \n\nSince 2015, the Toronto-Waterloo Region Corridor is a hub for high-growth companies developing breakthrough discoveries. <ref>https://thecorridor.ca</ref> \n\nThe Toronto-Waterloo Corridor is the largest tech cluster in North America outside of Silicon Valley. The area is home to more than 15,000 tech companies, including 5,000+ startups, and nearly 300,000 employees in high-tech industries. About two-thirds of those employees are classified as \u201ctech workers,\u201d which includes programmers, developers, etc. With 8% of the total workforce employed in tech, the Toronto-Waterloo Corridor also has a similar talent density to Silicon Valley and a much greater density than New York, Boston or Seattle. <ref>https://blog.waterlooedc.ca/what-is-toronto-waterloo-corridor</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe Golden Horseshoe is home to several [[university|universities]], including the [[University of Toronto]] and [[McMaster University]] in Hamilton, which are ranked 1st and 4th in Canada, respectively, by the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]. Other universities in the region include [[Brock University]] in St. Catherines, [[Trent University]] in Peterborough, [[York University]], [[OCAD University]], [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology]] in Oshawa, [[Ryerson University]], [[University of Guelph]], [[University of Waterloo]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] in Waterloo, and [[Universit\u00e9 de l'Ontario fran\u00e7ais]] in downtown Toronto.\n\nPublic primary and secondary schooling is typically provided by [[school boards]], largely organized at the municipal or county/regional level. The only school board that operates throughout the Golden Horseshoe is [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]], a public French-language school board, and [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]], a public French-language [[separate school|separate]] school board. Both of these public French-language school boards operate across the Ontario Peninsula.\n\n==Attractions==\n{{See also|Attractions in Toronto}}\n[[File:Caribana 2009 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Toronto Caribbean Carnival]] is an annual cultural festival held in the City of Toronto.]]\nFormerly the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|tallest freestanding structure on land in the world]], the [[CN Tower]] in Toronto is among the most internationally notable attractions in the Golden Horseshoe.\n\nThe city is home to several [[shopping mall]]s such as [[Yorkdale Shopping Centre]], [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] (which is North America's busiest shopping mall),<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Shopping Centre Study|url=http://www.retailcouncil.org/sites/default/files/RCCCanadianShoppingCenterStudyFINAL.pdf|publisher=[[Retail Council of Canada]]|accessdate=18 January 2017|date=December 2016}}</ref> [[Fairview Mall]], [[Scarborough Town Centre]], and [[Sherway Gardens]].

[[Pacific Mall]], in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], is the largest ethnic shopping mall in eastern Canada.\n\nAnnual cultural festivals that draw tourists and local alike include the Peeks Caribbean Carnival (formerly known as [[Caribana]]) and [[Taste of the Danforth]] in Toronto.\n[[File:Webster Falls - Laslovarga1.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Webster's Falls]] in Hamilton. The falls is a part of the [[Niagara Escarpment Biosphere Reserve]], which runs across the western portion of the Golden Horseshoe.]]\nThe [[Niagara Escarpment]], a world biosphere as designated by the United Nations, runs from the north at Bruce Peninsula and then east through the region cutting the Niagara Gorge at Niagara Falls. The [[Bruce Trail]] runs along the escarpment through mostly protected woodlands. The [[Cheltenham Badlands]] in Caledon is an [[Environmental degradation|environmentally degraded]] area along the Niagara Escarpment. Similar protection of some wooded areas exists on the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] running east\u2013west in the north end of the Greater Toronto Area, although development pressures continue to threaten the natural habitat.\n\nThe Niagara Region has become one of the major [[wine]]-production areas in Canada. The Golden Horseshoe contains many small towns with tourist-jammed, historic main streets, most notably the community of [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]], located at the mouth of the [[Niagara River]]. [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] is one of the world's largest waterfalls, and attracts millions to [[Clifton Hill, Niagara Falls|Clifton Hill]], a neighbourhood featuring hundreds of amusements, souvenir stores, restaurants and skyline-changing hotels. Casinos here are also a huge draw.\n\n[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] has the historical reputation of being a blue-collar city; however, waterfront redevelopments and large-scale [[gentrification]] have been rapidly changing the perception of the city, although it retains a dominant industrial base. Hamilton has over [[List of waterfalls in Hamilton, Ontario|100 waterfalls]] and cascades throughout the region.\n[[File:Leviathan Lift and Sculpture.jpg|thumb|View of [[Leviathan (roller coaster)|the Leviathan roller coaster]] at [[Canada's Wonderland]]. Located in [[Vaughan]], Wonderland is Canada's largest and most attended amusement park.]]\nThere are a number of [[Amusement park|theme parks]] in the Golden Horseshoe, all of which are seasonal. [[Canada's Wonderland]], run by [[Cedar Fair]] in Vaughan, {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Vaughan Mills, is the largest and most attended theme park in Canada, as well as the most attended seasonal theme park in North America. Other theme parks include [[Wet'n'Wild Toronto]] (formerly Wild Water Kingdom) in [[Brampton]], [[African Lion Safari]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]], and [[Marineland of Canada|Marineland]] in Niagara Falls.

The automotive industry is a major sector of the Golden Horseshoe's economy.]]\nCities including Hamilton, Oshawa, Oakville, Whitby and Kitchener all contain major large-scale industrial production facilities, Hamilton being dominated by the [[Steel#Steel industry|steel industry]] and Oakville and Oshawa primarily in the [[automotive industry]]. Other significant automotive-production facilities also exist in [[Brampton]], and [[St. Catharines]]. While manufacturing remains important to the economy of the region, the manufacturing sector has experienced a significant decline since 2000 as a result of unfavourable currency exchange rates, increasing energy costs, and reduced demand from the United States, which is by far the largest market for Ontario's goods.\n\nThe [[Hamilton-Oshawa Port Authority|Port of Hamilton]] and the [[PortsToronto|Port of Toronto]] are the two largest [[Port#Seaport|seaports]] on [[Lake Ontario]]. The [[Welland Canal]] system handles tanker ship and recreational traffic through the Great Lakes. Large rail and truck distribution facilities are located in Toronto, [[Vaughan]] and Brampton. Food processing is also a key ingredient in the economy. \n[[File:Wine grapes nearing harvest in Ontario-also example of trellis wire.jpg|thumb|The [[Niagara Peninsula]] is Canada's largest wine growing region and a major producer of [[Ontario wine]].]]\nNiagara Falls has one of the world's largest per-capita tourist economies, benefiting from millions of tourists coming to see its majestic waterfalls, shop in its numerous stores, and visit its many attractions. The winemaking and fruit growing industries of the [[Niagara Peninsula]] produce award-winning wines, which are beginning to attract attention around the world, in particular, the [[ice wine]] for which the region is known.\n\nAs of 2014, sectors such as [[information technology]], health care, Agtech, tourism, research and finance provide the bulk of growth in the Golden Horseshoe. The suburban cities within [[Greater Toronto]], such as [[Brampton]], [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Waterloo Region]] and [[Mississauga]], are emerging as hubs for technology and innovation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brampton.ca/EN/Business/economic-development/Key-Sectors/Pages/Innovation-and-Technology.aspx|title=Innovation & Technology|website=www.brampton.ca}}</ref> \n\nSince 2015, the Toronto-Waterloo Region Corridor is a hub for high-growth companies developing breakthrough discoveries. <ref>https://thecorridor.ca</ref> \n\nThe Toronto-Waterloo Corridor is the largest tech cluster in North America outside of Silicon Valley. The area is home to more than 15,000 tech companies, including 5,000+ startups, and nearly 300,000 employees in high-tech industries. About two-thirds of those employees are classified as \u201ctech workers,\u201d which includes programmers, developers, etc. With 8% of the total workforce employed in tech, the Toronto-Waterloo Corridor also has a similar talent density to Silicon Valley and a much greater density than New York, Boston or Seattle. <ref>https://blog.waterlooedc.ca/what-is-toronto-waterloo-corridor</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe Golden Horseshoe is home to several [[university|universities]], including the [[University of Toronto]] and [[McMaster University]] in Hamilton, which are ranked 1st and 4th in Canada, respectively, by the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]. Other universities in the region include [[Brock University]] in St. Catherines, [[Trent University]] in Peterborough, [[York University]], [[OCAD University]], [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology]] in Oshawa, [[Ryerson University]], [[University of Guelph]], [[University of Waterloo]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] in Waterloo, and [[Universit\u00e9 de l'Ontario fran\u00e7ais]] in downtown Toronto.\n\nPublic primary and secondary schooling is typically provided by [[school boards]], largely organized at the municipal or county/regional level. The only school board that operates throughout the Golden Horseshoe is [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]], a public French-language school board, and [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]], a public French-language [[separate school|separate]] school board.

The [[Bruce Trail]] runs along the escarpment through mostly protected woodlands. The [[Cheltenham Badlands]] in Caledon is an [[Environmental degradation|environmentally degraded]] area along the Niagara Escarpment. Similar protection of some wooded areas exists on the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] running east\u2013west in the north end of the Greater Toronto Area, although development pressures continue to threaten the natural habitat.\n\nThe Niagara Region has become one of the major [[wine]]-production areas in Canada. The Golden Horseshoe contains many small towns with tourist-jammed, historic main streets, most notably the community of [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]], located at the mouth of the [[Niagara River]]. [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] is one of the world's largest waterfalls, and attracts millions to [[Clifton Hill, Niagara Falls|Clifton Hill]], a neighbourhood featuring hundreds of amusements, souvenir stores, restaurants and skyline-changing hotels. Casinos here are also a huge draw.\n\n[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] has the historical reputation of being a blue-collar city; however, waterfront redevelopments and large-scale [[gentrification]] have been rapidly changing the perception of the city, although it retains a dominant industrial base. Hamilton has over [[List of waterfalls in Hamilton, Ontario|100 waterfalls]] and cascades throughout the region.\n[[File:Leviathan Lift and Sculpture.jpg|thumb|View of [[Leviathan (roller coaster)|the Leviathan roller coaster]] at [[Canada's Wonderland]].

Project Coast was the successor to a limited post-war CBW program which mainly produced the lethal agents [[CX powder]] and [[mustard gas]]; as well as non-lethal [[tear gas]] for riot control purposes.<ref>Gould, Chandr\u00e9 (2006) ''South Africa's Chemical and Biological Warfare programme 1981\u20131995,'' PhD thesis. Rhodes University.</ref> The program was headed by [[Wouter Basson]], a cardiologist who was the personal physician of the then South African Prime Minister [[P. W. Botha]].\n\n==History==\nFrom 1975 onwards, the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) found itself embroiled in conventional battles in [[Angola]] as a result of the [[South African Border War]]. The perception that its enemies had access to battlefield chemical and biological weapons led South Africa to begin expanding its own programme, initially as a defensive measure and to carry out research on [[vaccine]]s. As the years went on, research was carried out into offensive uses of the newly found capability. Finally, in 1981, then-president [[P. W. Botha]] ordered the SADF to develop the technology so that it could be used effectively against South Africa's enemies. In response, the head of the SADF's [[South African Medical Service]] (SAMS) division, responsible for defensive CBW capabilities, hired Dr [[Wouter Basson]], a [[cardiologist]], to visit other countries and report back on their respective CBW capabilities. He returned with the recommendation that South Africa's program be expanded, and in 1983, Project Coast was formed, with Dr Basson at its head.\n\nTo hide the program, and to make the procurement of CBW-related substances, Project Coast involved the formation of four [[front organization|front companies]]: [[Delta G Scientific Company]], [[Roodeplaat Research Laboratories]] (RRL), [[Protechnik]] and [[Infladel]].<ref>Chandr\u00e9 Gould, Peter I. Folb: ''Project Coast: Apartheid's Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme'', United Nations Publications, 2002 {{ISBN|9290451440}}</ref>\n\nProgressively, Project Coast created a large variety of lethal offensive CBW toxins and [[biotoxin]]s, in addition to the defensive measures. Initially, these were intended for use by the military in combat as a last resort. To this end Soviet techniques were being copied, and devices designed that looked like ordinary objects but had the capabilities to poison those targeted for assassination. Examples included umbrellas and walking sticks which fired pellets containing poison, syringes disguised as screwdrivers, and poisoned beer cans and envelopes. In the early 1990s, with the end of apartheid, [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|South Africa's various weapons of mass destruction]] programs were stopped. Despite efforts to destroy equipment, stocks, and information from these programs, some still remain. This has led to fears that they may find their way into the hands of terrorist networks. In May 2002, Daan Goosen \u2013 the former head of South Africa's biological weapons program \u2013 contacted the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and offered to exchange existing bacterial stocks from the program in return for US$5 million together with immigration permits for him plus 19 other associates and their family members. The offer was eventually refused, with the FBI claiming that the strains were obsolete and, therefore, no longer a threat.\n\n==Unusual features==\nThe South African chemical weapons program investigated all the standard CW agents such as irritant [[riot control agent]]s, lethal [[nerve agent]]s and [[anticholinergic]] [[deliriant]]s, which have been researched by virtually all countries that have carried out CW research. The South African program differed in its aims from the CBW programmes of many countries in that a major focus of the program was to develop non-lethal agents to help suppress internal dissent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unidir.org/files/publications/pdfs/project-coast-apartheid-s-chemical-and-biological-warfare-programme-296.pdf|title=Project Coast: Apartheid's Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme|publisher=United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research|pages=77\u2013109|accessdate=29 October 2018}}</ref> This led to the investigation of unusual non-lethal agents, including illicit recreational drugs such as [[phencyclidine]], [[MDMA]], [[methaqualone]] and [[cocaine]], as well as medicinal drugs such as [[diazepam]], [[ketamine]], [[suxamethonium]] and [[tubocurarine]], as potential incapacitating agents. According to the testimony given by [[Wouter Basson]] to the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]],<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120709030636/http://ccrweb.ccr.uct.ac.za/archive/cbw/49.html</ref> analogues of these compounds were prepared and studied, and both methaqualone and MDMA (along with the deliriant [[3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate|BZ]]) were manufactured in large quantities and successfully weaponised into a fine dust or aerosol form that could be released over a crowd as a potential riot control agent. Basson was later found to have also been selling large quantities of MDMA and methaqualone as tablets on the black market, but the amount manufactured was far larger than what was sold and the court accepted that at least some genuine weaponisation and testing of these agents had been done. A [[black mamba]] and extracted venom were also part of the research, as were E coli O157:H7 bacteria genetically modified to produce some of the toxins made by ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' bacteria.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unidir.org/pdf/ouvrages/pdf-1-92-9045-144-0-en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913222559/http://www.unidir.org/pdf/ouvrages/pdf-1-92-9045-144-0-en.pdf |archivedate=13 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }} ''Project Coast: Apartheid's Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme''.

Other plans referenced in the UN report included crowd control with [[pheromones]], and a discussion about developing a new, stronger analogue of methaqualone.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\nAnother unusual project attempted to develop a method of sterilising crowds using a known male sterilant, [[pyridine]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} This was to be sprayed onto the crowds from a gas cylinder pressurised with nitrogen gas, as [[pyridine]] is highly flammable. A subsequent industrial accident caused the death of a gas company employee when the experimental contaminated medical oxygen cylinder was returned to the gas supplier and filled with oxygen which exploded.<ref>Brian Robson, Production Manager Messer Fedgas SA 1999</ref>\n\n==Employment==\nProject Coast claimed its first victims at the end of 1982, when \"Operation Duel\" was launched, which aimed to eliminate hundreds of SWAPO prisoners and SADF informants. Col. Johan Theron, counterintelligence officer in the Special Forces, testified at the Basson trial that he received muscle relaxant pills from Basson in December 1982, and killed approximately 200 SWAPO prisoners, then dumped their bodies from aeroplanes out to sea.\n\nIn November 1983, Basson was allegedly involved in the use of CBW against regime opponents in Dukuduku in KwaZulu-Natal. There, he instructed South African agents to tie their intended victims to trees and smear a gel-like ointment on their bodies. When that failed to kill them, they were allegedly injected with an anaesthetic drug and then a muscle relaxant. After they had died, their bodies were thrown into the sea.\n\nIn 1985, four SWAPO detainees held at Reconnaissance Regiment headquarters were allegedly given a sleeping drug in soft drinks, taken to Lanseria airport outside Johannesburg and injected with three toxic substances supplied by Basson. Their bodies were thrown into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn April 1989, the [[Civil Cooperation Bureau]] attempted to assassinate the Reverend Frank Chikane with poison during a trip he was making to Namibia. The Civil Cooperation Bureau made another attempt to poison Chikane during a trip to the United States, where one doctor diagnosed his malady as organophosphate poisoning. According to the testimony of Roodeplaat Research Laboratories scientist Schalk van Rensburg to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the men who tried to kill Chikane with [[Parathion]] poison had poor intelligence. He stated, \"They were counting on little forensic capability in Namibia. Additionally, too little was smeared over his underwear to kill him when he went to the US\".\n\nCivil Cooperation Bureau operative Petrus Jacobus Botes (who claimed to have also directed bureau operations in Mozambique and Swaziland) asserted that he was ordered in May 1989, to contaminate the water supply at Dobra, a refugee camp located in Namibia, with cholera and yellow fever organisms. A South African Army doctor provided them to him. In late August 1989, he led an attempt to contaminate the water supply. The attempt failed because of the high chlorine content in the treated water at the camp.<ref>Helen E. Purkitt, Stephen F.

Daan Goosen, the managing director of Roodeplaat Research Laboratories between 1983 and 1986, told Tom Mangold of the BBC that Project Coast supported a project to develop a contraceptive that would have been applied clandestinely to blacks. Goosen reported that the project had developed a vaccine for males and females and that the researchers were still searching for a means by which it could be delivered to make blacks sterile without making them aware. Testimony given at the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) suggested that Project Coast researchers were also looking into putting birth control substances in water supplies.<ref>Helen E.

Project Coast was the successor to a limited post-war CBW program which mainly produced the lethal agents [[CX powder]] and [[mustard gas]]; as well as non-lethal [[tear gas]] for riot control purposes.<ref>Gould, Chandr\u00e9 (2006) ''South Africa's Chemical and Biological Warfare programme 1981\u20131995,'' PhD thesis. Rhodes University.</ref> The program was headed by [[Wouter Basson]], a cardiologist who was the personal physician of the then South African Prime Minister [[P. W. Botha]].\n\n==History==\nFrom 1975 onwards, the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) found itself embroiled in conventional battles in [[Angola]] as a result of the [[South African Border War]]. The perception that its enemies had access to battlefield chemical and biological weapons led South Africa to begin expanding its own programme, initially as a defensive measure and to carry out research on [[vaccine]]s. As the years went on, research was carried out into offensive uses of the newly found capability. Finally, in 1981, then-president [[PW Botha]] ordered the SADF to develop the technology so that it could be used effectively against South Africa's enemies. In response, the head of the SADF's [[South African Medical Service]] (SAMS) division, responsible for defensive CBW capabilities, hired Dr [[Wouter Basson]], a [[cardiologist]], to visit other countries and report back on their respective CBW capabilities. He returned with the recommendation that South Africa's program be expanded, and in 1983, Project Coast was formed, with Dr Basson at its head.\n\nTo hide the program, and to make the procurement of CBW-related substances, Project Coast involved the formation of four [[front organization|front companies]]: [[Delta G Scientific Company]], [[Roodeplaat Research Laboratories]] (RRL), [[Protechnik]] and [[Infladel]].<ref>Chandr\u00e9 Gould, Peter I. Folb: ''Project Coast: Apartheid's Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme'', United Nations Publications, 2002 {{ISBN|9290451440}}</ref>\n\nProgressively, Project Coast created a large variety of lethal offensive CBW toxins and [[biotoxin]]s, in addition to the defensive measures. Initially, these were intended for use by the military in combat as a last resort. To this end Soviet techniques were being copied, and devices designed that looked like ordinary objects but had the capabilities to poison those targeted for assassination. Examples included umbrellas and walking sticks which fired pellets containing poison, syringes disguised as screwdrivers, and poisoned beer cans and envelopes. In the early 1990s, with the end of apartheid, [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|South Africa's various weapons of mass destruction]] programs were stopped. Despite efforts to destroy equipment, stocks, and information from these programs, some still remain. This has led to fears that they may find their way into the hands of terrorist networks. In May 2002, Daan Goosen \u2013 the former head of South Africa's biological weapons program \u2013 contacted the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and offered to exchange existing bacterial stocks from the program in return for US$5 million together with immigration permits for him plus 19 other associates and their family members. The offer was eventually refused, with the FBI claiming that the strains were obsolete and, therefore, no longer a threat.\n\n==Unusual features==\nThe South African chemical weapons program investigated all the standard CW agents such as irritant [[riot control agent]]s, lethal [[nerve agent]]s and [[anticholinergic]] [[deliriant]]s, which have been researched by virtually all countries that have carried out CW research.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nIt is geographically within the province of [[Lanao del Norte]] but administered independently from the province. It was once part of [[Central Mindanao]] (Region 12) until the province was moved under Northern Mindanao (Region 10) in 2001.<ref>Godinez-Ortega, C. (2001, September 9). Iligan City 'moves' to Northern Mindanao, Philippine Daily Inquirer. P. A13.</ref> Iligan is approximately 90&nbsp;km away from the capital of the province, [[Tubod, Lanao del Norte|Tubod]], and approximately 800&nbsp;km from the capital of the [[Philippines]], [[Manila]].\n\nIligan has a total land area of {{Convert|813.37|km2}}, making it one of the 10 largest cities in the Philippines in terms of land area. Among the 17 [[Cities of the Philippines|highly urbanized city]], excluding [[Metro Manila]], Iligan is the third least dense, with a population density of 421 inhabitants per square kilometer, just behind [[Butuan City]] and [[Puerto Princesa City]].<ref>https://psa.gov.ph/population-and-housing/node/62690</ref> Iligan has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} inhabitants in the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name Iligan is from the Higaunon (Lumad/Native of Iligan) word \"Ilig\" which means \"to go downstream\". However, some also claim that the name of Iligan was taken and inspired by the Higaunon term \"iligan\" or \"ilijan,\" which means \"fortress of defense,\" an appropriate term due to the frequent attacks incurred by pirates as well as other Mindanaon tribes.\n\n==History==\n=== Pre-Spanish colonial area ===\nIligan City had its beginnings in the village of Bayug, four (4) kilometers north of the present Poblacion. It was the earliest pre-Spanish settlement of native sea dwellers. In the later part of the 16th century, the inhabitants were subdued by the Visayan migrants from the island-nation called the Kedatuan of Dapitan, on [[Panglao Island|Panglao]] island.\n\nIn the accounts of Jesuit historian Francisco Combes, the Mollucan Sultan of Ternate invaded [[Panglao, Bohol|Panglao]]. This caused the Dapitans to flee in large numbers to a re-established [[Dapitan City|Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte]].\n\n=== Spanish colonial era === \nIn Dapitan, the surviving Datu of [[Panglao, Bohol|Panglao]] Pagbuaya, received [[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi|Legazpi]]'s expedition in 1595. Later, Pagbuaya's son Manook was baptized Pedro Manuel Manook. Sometime afterwards in by the end of the 16th century after 1595 Manook subdued the ''higaunon'' (animist) village of Bayug and turned it into one of the earliest Christian settlements in the country.<ref>[http://www.iligan.gov.ph/about-iligan/history/during-spanish-times/ History of Iligan during Spanish times]</ref> Although the settlement survived other raids from other enemies, especially Muslims of Lanao, the early settlers and converts moved their settlement from Bayug to Iligan, which the Augustinian [[Recollects]] founded in 1609,<ref>[http://allaboutiligan.blogspot.com/ All About Iligan]</ref> thus founding the oldest town in northern Mindanao.\n\n[[File:Camp-overton-iligan-city.jpg|thumb|left|Camp Overton in 1900, an American Armybase, currently the location of Global Steel Philippines Inc.]]\n\nThe Jesuits replaced the Recollects in 1639. Iligan was the Spaniards' base of operations in attempting to conquer and Christianize the [[Lake Lanao]] area throughout its history. A stone fort called Fort St. Francis Xavier was built in 1642 where Iliganons sought refuge during raids by bandits. But the fort sank due to floods. Another fort was built and this was named Fort Victoria or Cota de Iligan.\n\nIn 1850, because of floods, Don Remigio Cabili, then Iligan's governadorcillo, built another fort and moved the [[poblacion]] of the old Iligan located at the mouth of Tubod River west of the old market to its present site.\n\nBeing the oldest town in Northern Mindanao, Iligan was already a part of the once undivided [[Misamis (province)|Misamis Province]] by year 1832. However, it did not have an independent religious administration because its diocese by then was based at [[Ozamiz|Misamis]], the provincial capital. It was one of the biggest municipalities of Misamis Province.\n\nThe Spaniards abandoned Iligan in 1899, paving the way for the landing of the American forces in 1900.\n\n===American era===\n[[File:Street-in-iligan-moro-province.jpg|thumbnail|right|Iligan, circa 1903-1913]]\nIn 1903, the Moro Province was created. Iligan, because of its Moro residents, was taken away from the Misamis Province. Then Iligan became the capital of the Lanao District and seat of the government where the American officials lived and held office. Later in 1907 the capital of the Lanao District was transferred to Dansalan.<ref>Prof. Patrocenia T. Acut, [http://www.iligan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=594&Itemid=609 Iligan During the American Period], Iligan City Official Website</ref>\n\nIn 1914, under the restructuring of Moroland after the end of the Moro Province (1903\u20131913), Iligan became a municipality composed of eight barrios together with the municipal district of Mandulog. After enjoying peace and prosperity for about 40 years, Iligan was invaded by Japanese forces in 1942.\n\nThe liberation in Iligan by the Philippine Commonwealth forces attacked by the Japanese held sway in the city until 1944 to 1945 when the war ended. On November 15, 1944, the city held a Commonwealth Day parade to celebrate the end of Japanese atrocities and occupation.<ref>Prof. Leonor Buhion Enderes, [http://www.iligan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=387&Itemid=353 Japanese Occupation in Iligan City], Iligan City Official Website</ref>\n\n===Cityhood===\nUsing the same territorial definition as a municipality, Iligan became a chartered city of Lanao del Norte on June 16, 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra525-iligan-city-charter.html|title=R.A.

East of the city, flat cultivated coastal land gives way to steep volcanic hills and mountains providing the waterfalls and cold springs for which the area is well known.\n\n===Climate===\nIligan falls within the third type of climate wherein the seasons are not very pronounced. Rain is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. Because of its tropical location the city does not experience cold weather. Neither does it experience strong weather disturbances due to its geographical location (being outside the typhoon belt) And also because of the mountains that are surrounding the city.\n\n{{Weather box    \n| width        =  auto\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes\n| location     =  Iligan City, Philippines\n\n<!--Mean daily temperature-->\n| Jan mean C = 26.1\n| Feb mean C = 26.3\n| Mar mean C = 26.9\n| Apr mean C = 27.7\n| May mean C = 27.8\n| Jun mean C = 27.5\n| Jul mean C = 27.1\n| Aug mean C = 27.3\n| Sep mean C = 27.1\n| Oct mean C = 27.1\n| Nov mean C = 26.9\n| Dec mean C = 26.5\n| year mean C = 27.1\n\n<!-- Record high temperatures -->\n| Jan record high C = 30.6\n| Feb record high C = 30.9\n| Mar record high C = 31.8\n| Apr record high C = 32.8\n| May record high C = 32.7\n| Jun record high C = 32.2\n| Jul record high C = 31.9\n| Aug record high C = 32.1\n| Sep record high C = 31.9\n| Oct record high C = 31.9\n| Nov record high C = 31.7\n| Dec record high C = 31.1\n| year record high C = 32.8\n\n<!-- Note that record temperatures should only be used when the data period is of the greatest length possible. -->\n| Jan record low C  = 21.7\n| Feb record low C  = 21.8\n| Mar record low C  = 22.0\n| Apr record low C  = 22.6\n| May record low C  = 23.1\n| Jun record low C  = 22.8\n| Jul record low C  = 22.4\n| Aug record low C  = 22.5\n| Sep record low C  = 22.4\n| Oct record low C  = 22.4\n| Nov record low C  = 22.2\n| Dec record low C  = 22.0\n| year record low C = 21.7\n\n<!--Rainfall-->\n| rain colour = green<!--Enter \"green\" for green rainfall colors, remove this line for blue coloring.-->\n| Jan rain mm = 106.1\n| Feb rain mm = 90.5\n| Mar rain mm = 88.2\n| Apr rain mm = 80.2\n| May rain mm = 145.1\n| Jun rain mm = 217.7\n| Jul rain mm = 247.9\n| Aug rain mm = 342.0\n| Sep rain mm = 578.1\n| Oct rain mm = 780.0\n| Nov rain mm = 299.3\n| Dec rain mm = 208.1\n| year rain mm = 3183.2\n\n<!-- Average number of precipitation days -->\n| precip days colour      = pastel\n| unit precipitation days =  0.1 mm\n| Jan precipitation days  = 23.2\n| Feb precipitation days  = 19.5\n| Mar precipitation days  = 22.0\n| Apr precipitation days  = 22.8\n| May precipitation days  = 29.6\n| Jun precipitation days  = 28.9\n| Jul precipitation days  = 29.0\n| Aug precipitation days  = 29.8\n| Sep precipitation days  = 28.1\n| Oct precipitation days  = 28.8\n| Nov precipitation days  = 26.1\n| Dec precipitation days  = 24.1\n| year precipitation days = 311.9\n\n<!-- Average monthly sunshine hours, monthly totals are preferred, and will produce colours, but percentages are accepted.-->\n| Jan sun  = 390.6\n| Feb sun  = 370.1\n| Mar sun  = 545.6\n| Apr sun  = 573.0\n| May sun  = 378.2\n| Jun sun  = 225.0\n| Jul sun  = 229.4\n| Aug sun  = 254.2\n| Sep sun  = 246.0\n| Oct sun  = 294.5\n| Nov sun  = 360.0\n| Dec sun  = 421.6\n| year sun = 4288.2\n\n<!-- Mandatory fields, source -->\n| source 1 = Average Climate of Iligan City <ref>{{cite web |url= https://en.climate-data.org/asia/philippines/iligan/iligan-6177/#climate-graph |title= Climate: Iligan |publisher= Climate Data Organization |access-date=June 10, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n| source 2 = Climate of Iligan City <ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/forecast/modelclimate/iligan-city_philippines_1711082 |title= Climate of Iligan City |publisher= meteoblue |access-date=June 10, 2019 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Barangays===\n[[File:2010.08.25 Fra Quezon Avenue IV.JPG|thumb|Downtown area]]\n[[File:Echiverri Street in Iligan.JPG|thumbnail|Echiverri Street]]\nIligan City is politically subdivided into 44 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* Abuno\n* Acmac\n* Bagong Silang\n* Bonbonon\n* Bunawan\n* Buru-un\n* Dalipuga\n* Del Carmen\n* Digkilaan\n* Ditucalan\n* Dulag\n* Hinaplanon\n* Hindang\n* Kabacsanan\n* Kalilangan\n* Kiwalan\n* Lanipao\n* Luinab\n* Mahayahay\n* Mainit\n* Mandulog\n* Maria Cristina\n* Pala-o\n* Panoroganan\n* Poblacion\n* Puga-an\n* Rogongon\n* San Miguel\n* San Roque\n* Santa Elena\n* Santa Filomena\n* Santiago\n* Santo Rosario\n* Saray\n* [[Suarez, Iligan|Suarez]]\n* [[Tambacan, Iligan|Tambacan]]\n* Tibanga\n* Tipanoy\n* [[Tomas L.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nIt is geographically within the province of [[Lanao del Norte]] but administered independently from the province. It was once part of [[Central Mindanao]] (Region 12) until the province was moved under Northern Mindanao (Region 10) in 2001.<ref>Godinez-Ortega, C. (2001, September 9).

A13.</ref> Iligan is approximately 90&nbsp;km away from the capital of the province, [[Tubod, Lanao del Norte|Tubod]], and approximately 800&nbsp;km from the capital of the [[Philippines]], [[Manila]].\n\nIligan has a total land area of {{Convert|813.37|km2}}, making it one of the 10 largest cities in the Philippines in terms of land area. Among the 17 [[Cities of the Philippines|highly urbanized city]], excluding [[Metro Manila]], Iligan is the third least dense, with a population density of 421 inhabitants per square kilometer, just behind [[Butuan City]] and [[Puerto Princesa City]].<ref>https://psa.gov.ph/population-and-housing/node/62690</ref> Iligan has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} inhabitants in the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name Iligan is from the Higaunon (Lumad/Native of Iligan) word \"Ilig\" which means \"to go downstream\". However, some also claim that the name of Iligan was taken and inspired by the Higaunon term \"iligan\" or \"ilijan,\" which means \"fortress of defense,\" an appropriate term due to the frequent attacks incurred by pirates as well as other Mindanaon tribes.\n\n==History==\n=== Pre-Spanish colonial area ===\nIligan City had its beginnings in the village of Bayug, four (4) kilometers north of the present Poblacion. It was the earliest pre-Spanish settlement of native sea dwellers. In the later part of the 16th century, the inhabitants were subdued by the Visayan migrants from the island-nation called the Kedatuan of Dapitan, on [[Panglao Island|Panglao]] island.\n\nIn the accounts of Jesuit historian Francisco Combes, the Mollucan Sultan of Ternate invaded [[Panglao, Bohol|Panglao]]. This caused the Dapitans to flee in large numbers to a re-established [[Dapitan City|Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte]].\n\n=== Spanish colonial era === \nIn Dapitan, the surviving Datu of [[Panglao, Bohol|Panglao]] Pagbuaya, received [[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi|Legazpi]]'s expedition in 1595. Later, Pagbuaya's son Manook was baptized Pedro Manuel Manook. Sometime afterwards in by the end of the 16th century after 1595 Manook subdued the ''higaunon'' (animist) village of Bayug and turned it into one of the earliest Christian settlements in the country.<ref>[http://www.iligan.gov.ph/about-iligan/history/during-spanish-times/ History of Iligan during Spanish times]</ref> Although the settlement survived other raids from other enemies, especially Muslims of Lanao, the early settlers and converts moved their settlement from Bayug to Iligan, which the Augustinian [[Recollects]] founded in 1609,<ref>[http://allaboutiligan.blogspot.com/ All About Iligan]</ref> thus founding the oldest town in northern Mindanao.\n\n[[File:Camp-overton-iligan-city.jpg|thumb|left|Camp Overton in 1900, an American Armybase, currently the location of Global Steel Philippines Inc.]]\n\nThe Jesuits replaced the Recollects in 1639. Iligan was the Spaniards' base of operations in attempting to conquer and Christianize the [[Lake Lanao]] area throughout its history. A stone fort called Fort St. Francis Xavier was built in 1642 where Iliganons sought refuge during raids by bandits. But the fort sank due to floods. Another fort was built and this was named Fort Victoria or Cota de Iligan.\n\nIn 1850, because of floods, Don Remigio Cabili, then Iligan's governadorcillo, built another fort and moved the [[poblacion]] of the old Iligan located at the mouth of Tubod River west of the old market to its present site.\n\nBeing the oldest town in Northern Mindanao, Iligan was already a part of the once undivided [[Misamis (province)|Misamis Province]] by year 1832. However, it did not have an independent religious administration because its diocese by then was based at [[Ozamiz|Misamis]], the provincial capital. It was one of the biggest municipalities of Misamis Province.\n\nThe Spaniards abandoned Iligan in 1899, paving the way for the landing of the American forces in 1900.\n\n===American era===\n[[File:Street-in-iligan-moro-province.jpg|thumbnail|right|Iligan, circa 1903-1913]]\nIn 1903, the Moro Province was created. Iligan, because of its Moro residents, was taken away from the Misamis Province. Then Iligan became the capital of the Lanao District and seat of the government where the American officials lived and held office. Later in 1907 the capital of the Lanao District was transferred to Dansalan.<ref>Prof. Patrocenia T. Acut, [http://www.iligan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=594&Itemid=609 Iligan During the American Period], Iligan City Official Website</ref>\n\nIn 1914, under the restructuring of Moroland after the end of the Moro Province (1903\u20131913), Iligan became a municipality composed of eight barrios together with the municipal district of Mandulog. After enjoying peace and prosperity for about 40 years, Iligan was invaded by Japanese forces in 1942.\n\nThe liberation in Iligan by the Philippine Commonwealth forces attacked by the Japanese held sway in the city until 1944 to 1945 when the war ended. On November 15, 1944, the city held a Commonwealth Day parade to celebrate the end of Japanese atrocities and occupation.<ref>Prof. Leonor Buhion Enderes, [http://www.iligan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=387&Itemid=353 Japanese Occupation in Iligan City], Iligan City Official Website</ref>\n\n===Cityhood===\nUsing the same territorial definition as a municipality, Iligan became a chartered city of Lanao del Norte on June 16, 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra525-iligan-city-charter.html|title=R.A.

East of the city, flat cultivated coastal land gives way to steep volcanic hills and mountains providing the waterfalls and cold springs for which the area is well known.\n\n===Climate===\nIligan falls within the third type of climate wherein the seasons are not very pronounced. Rain is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. Because of its tropical location the city does not experience cold weather. Neither does it experience strong weather disturbances due to its geographical location (being outside the typhoon belt) And also because of the mountains that are surrounding the city.\n\n{{Weather box    \n| width        =  auto\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes\n| location     =  Iligan City, Philippines\n\n<!--Mean daily temperature-->\n| Jan mean C = 26.1\n| Feb mean C = 26.3\n| Mar mean C = 26.9\n| Apr mean C = 27.7\n| May mean C = 27.8\n| Jun mean C = 27.5\n| Jul mean C = 27.1\n| Aug mean C = 27.3\n| Sep mean C = 27.1\n| Oct mean C = 27.1\n| Nov mean C = 26.9\n| Dec mean C = 26.5\n| year mean C = 27.1\n\n<!-- Record high temperatures -->\n| Jan record high C = 30.6\n| Feb record high C = 30.9\n| Mar record high C = 31.8\n| Apr record high C = 32.8\n| May record high C = 32.7\n| Jun record high C = 32.2\n| Jul record high C = 31.9\n| Aug record high C = 32.1\n| Sep record high C = 31.9\n| Oct record high C = 31.9\n| Nov record high C = 31.7\n| Dec record high C = 31.1\n| year record high C = 32.8\n\n<!-- Note that record temperatures should only be used when the data period is of the greatest length possible. -->\n| Jan record low C  = 21.7\n| Feb record low C  = 21.8\n| Mar record low C  = 22.0\n| Apr record low C  = 22.6\n| May record low C  = 23.1\n| Jun record low C  = 22.8\n| Jul record low C  = 22.4\n| Aug record low C  = 22.5\n| Sep record low C  = 22.4\n| Oct record low C  = 22.4\n| Nov record low C  = 22.2\n| Dec record low C  = 22.0\n| year record low C = 21.7\n\n<!--Rainfall-->\n| rain colour = green<!--Enter \"green\" for green rainfall colors, remove this line for blue coloring.-->\n| Jan rain mm = 106.1\n| Feb rain mm = 90.5\n| Mar rain mm = 88.2\n| Apr rain mm = 80.2\n| May rain mm = 145.1\n| Jun rain mm = 217.7\n| Jul rain mm = 247.9\n| Aug rain mm = 342.0\n| Sep rain mm = 578.1\n| Oct rain mm = 780.0\n| Nov rain mm = 299.3\n| Dec rain mm = 208.1\n| year rain mm = 3183.2\n\n<!-- Average number of precipitation days -->\n| precip days colour      = pastel\n| unit precipitation days =  0.1 mm\n| Jan precipitation days  = 23.2\n| Feb precipitation days  = 19.5\n| Mar precipitation days  = 22.0\n| Apr precipitation days  = 22.8\n| May precipitation days  = 29.6\n| Jun precipitation days  = 28.9\n| Jul precipitation days  = 29.0\n| Aug precipitation days  = 29.8\n| Sep precipitation days  = 28.1\n| Oct precipitation days  = 28.8\n| Nov precipitation days  = 26.1\n| Dec precipitation days  = 24.1\n| year precipitation days = 311.9\n\n<!-- Average monthly sunshine hours, monthly totals are preferred, and will produce colours, but percentages are accepted.-->\n| Jan sun  = 390.6\n| Feb sun  = 370.1\n| Mar sun  = 545.6\n| Apr sun  = 573.0\n| May sun  = 378.2\n| Jun sun  = 225.0\n| Jul sun  = 229.4\n| Aug sun  = 254.2\n| Sep sun  = 246.0\n| Oct sun  = 294.5\n| Nov sun  = 360.0\n| Dec sun  = 421.6\n| year sun = 4288.2\n\n<!-- Mandatory fields, source -->\n| source 1 = Average Climate of Iligan City <ref>{{cite web |url= https://en.climate-data.org/asia/philippines/iligan/iligan-6177/#climate-graph |title= Climate: Iligan |publisher= Climate Data Organization |access-date=June 10, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n| source 2 = Climate of Iligan City <ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/forecast/modelclimate/iligan-city_philippines_1711082 |title= Climate of Iligan City |publisher= meteoblue |access-date=June 10, 2019 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Barangays===\n[[File:2010.08.25 Fra Quezon Avenue IV.JPG|thumb|Downtown area]]\n[[File:Echiverri Street in Iligan.JPG|thumbnail|Echiverri Street]]\nIligan City is politically subdivided into 44 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* Abuno\n* Acmac\n* Bagong Silang\n* Bonbonon\n* Bunawan\n* Buru-un\n* Dalipuga\n* Del Carmen\n* Digkilaan\n* Ditucalan\n* Dulag\n* Hinaplanon\n* Hindang\n* Kabacsanan\n* Kalilangan\n* Kiwalan\n* Lanipao\n* Luinab\n* Mahayahay\n* Mainit\n* Mandulog\n* Maria Cristina\n* Pala-o\n* Panoroganan\n* Poblacion\n* Puga-an\n* Rogongon\n* San Miguel\n* San Roque\n* Santa Elena\n* Santa Filomena\n* Santiago\n* Santo Rosario\n* Saray\n* [[Suarez, Iligan|Suarez]]\n* [[Tambacan, Iligan|Tambacan]]\n* Tibanga\n* Tipanoy\n* [[Tomas L.
