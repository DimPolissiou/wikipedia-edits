For the remaining part it flows merely westerly through the [[Murchison Falls]] until it reaches the very northern shores of [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] where it forms a significant [[river delta]]. The lake itself is on the border of [[DR Congo]], but the Nile is not a border river at this point. After leaving Lake Albert, the river continues north through Uganda and is known as the [[Albert Nile]].\n\n=== In South Sudan ===\nThe Nile river flows into [[South Sudan]] just south of [[Nimule]], where it is known as the [[White Nile|Bahr al Jabal]] (\"Mountain River\"{{refn|Arabic ''bahr'' can refer to either seas or large rivers.<ref name=\"EB-name\"/>}}). Just south of the town it has the [[confluence]] with the [[Achwa River]]. The [[Bahr el Ghazal River|Bahr al Ghazal]], itself {{convert|716|km|sp=us}} long, joins the Bahr al Jabal at a small lagoon called [[Lake No]], after which the Nile becomes known as the ''Bahr al Abyad'', or the [[White Nile]], from the whitish [[clay]] suspended in its waters. When the [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]] it leaves a rich silty deposit which fertilizes the soil. The Nile no longer floods in Egypt since the completion of the [[Aswan Dam]] in 1970. An [[anabranch]] river, the [[Bahr el Zeraf]], flows out of the Nile's Bahr al Jabal section and rejoins the White Nile.\n\nThe flow rate of the Bahr al Jabal at [[Mongalla, South Sudan]] is almost constant throughout the year and averages {{convert|1048|m3/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}. After Mongalla, the Bahr Al Jabal enters the enormous swamps of the [[Sudd]] region of South Sudan. More than half of the Nile's water is lost in this swamp to [[evaporation]] and [[transpiration]]. The average flow rate of the White Nile at the tails of the swamps is about {{convert|510|m3/s|sigfig=2|abbr=on|sp=us}}. From here it soon meets with the [[Sobat River]] at [[Malakal]]. On an annual basis, the White Nile upstream of Malakal contributes about fifteen percent of the total outflow of the Nile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ielrc.org/content/a0509.pdf |author=Hurst H.E. |year=2011 |title=The Nile Basins &#124;volume 1 The Hydrology of the Blue Nile and Akbara and the Main Nile to Aswan, with some Reference to the Projects Nile control Dept. paper 12 |publisher=Government Printing office |location=Cairo |display-authors=etal |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726172514/http://www.ielrc.org/content/a0509.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011  }}</ref>\n\nThe average flow of the White Nile at Lake Kawaki Malakal, just below the Sobat River, is {{convert|924|m3/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}; the peak flow is approximately {{convert|1218|m3/s|abbr=on|sp=us}} in October and minimum flow is about {{convert|609|m3/s|abbr=on|sp=us}} in April.

One is that the integrated drainage of the Nile is of young age and that the Nile basin was formerly broken into series of separate basins, only the most northerly of which fed a river following the present course of the Nile in Egypt and Sudan. Rushdi Said postulated that Egypt itself supplied most of the waters of the Nile during the early part of its history.<ref name=Said1981>Said, R. (1981). ''The geological evolution of the River Nile''. [[Springer Verlag]].</ref>\n\nThe other theory is that the drainage from Ethiopia via rivers equivalent to the Blue Nile, the Atbara and the [[Tekez\u00e9 River|Takazze]] flowed to the Mediterranean via the Egyptian Nile since well back into [[Tertiary]] times.<ref name=WW1980>Williams, M.A.J.; Williams, F.

The River Atbara overflowed its closed basin during the wet periods that occurred about 100,000 to 120,000 years ago. The Blue Nile connected to the main Nile during the 70,000\u201380,000 years B.P. wet period. The White Nile system in Bahr El Arab and White Nile Rifts remained a closed lake until the connection of the Victoria Nile to the main system some 12,500 years ago during the [[African humid period]].\n\n=== Role in the founding of Egyptian civilization ===\n[[File:Dhows on the Nile.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A [[felucca]] traversing the Nile near Aswan]]\n\nThe Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that \"Egypt was the gift of the Nile\". An unending source of sustenance, it played a crucial role in the development of Egyptian civilization. Because the river overflowed its banks annually and deposited new layers of silt, the surrounding land was very fertile. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians cultivated and traded [[wheat]], [[flax]], [[papyrus]] and other crops around the Nile. Wheat was a crucial crop in the famine-plagued Middle East. This trading system secured Egypt's diplomatic relationships with other countries, and contributed to economic stability. Far-reaching trade has been carried on along the Nile since ancient times. A tune, [[Hymn to the Nile]], was created and sung by the ancient Egyptian peoples about the flooding of the Nile River and all of the miracles it brought to Ancient Egyptian civilization.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://arcjohn.wordpress.com/89-2/|title=Hymn to the Nile|date=23 March 2010|publisher=ARCJOHN|access-date=20 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123133714/https://arcjohn.wordpress.com/89-2/|archive-date=23 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Domestic buffalo|Water buffalo]] were introduced from Asia and the Assyrians introduced [[camel]]s in the 7th century BC. These animals were killed for meat, and were domesticated and used for ploughing\u2014or in the camels' case, carriage. Water was vital to both people and livestock. The Nile was also a convenient and efficient means of transportation for people and goods.\n\nThe Nile was also an important part of ancient Egyptian spiritual life. [[Hapi (Nile god)|Hapi]] was the god of the annual floods, and both he and the [[pharaoh]] were thought to control the flooding. The Nile was considered to be a causeway from life to death and the afterlife. The east was thought of as a place of birth and growth, and the west was considered the place of death, as the god [[Ra]], the Sun, underwent birth, death, and resurrection each day as he crossed the sky. Thus, all tombs were west of the Nile, because the Egyptians believed that in order to enter the afterlife, they had to be buried on the side that symbolized death.\n\nAs the Nile was such an important factor in Egyptian life, the ancient calendar was even based on the three cycles of the Nile. These seasons, each consisting of four months of thirty days each, were called [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]], [[Season of the Emergence|Peret]], and [[Shemu]]. Akhet, which means inundation, was the time of the year when the Nile flooded, leaving several layers of fertile soil behind, aiding in agricultural growth.<ref name=\"SpringerMorris2010\">{{cite book|last1=Springer|first1=Lisa|author2=Neil Morris|title=Art and Culture of Ancient Egypt|year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4358-3589-4|page=8}}</ref> Peret was the growing season, and Shemu, the last season, was the harvest season when there were no rains.<ref name=\"SpringerMorris2010\"/>\n\n=== Search for the source of the Nile ===\n[[File:JH Speke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Hanning Speke|John&nbsp;Hanning&nbsp;Speke]]&nbsp;{{circa|lk=no|1863}}.

Although [[James Bruce]] claimed to be the first European to have visited the headwaters,<ref>[[Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile]]</ref> modern writers give the credit to the [[Jesuit]] [[Pedro P\u00e1ez]]. P\u00e1ez's account of the source of the Nile<ref>''History of Ethiopia'', circa 1622</ref> is a long and vivid account of Ethiopia.

Telles also used his account.\n\nThe White Nile was even less understood. The ancients mistakenly believed that the [[Niger River]] represented the upper reaches of the White Nile. For example, [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that the Nile had its origins \"in a mountain of lower [[Mauretania]]\", flowed above ground for \"many days\" distance, then went underground, reappeared as a large lake in the territories of the [[Masaesyli]], then sank again below the desert to flow underground \"for a distance of 20 days' journey till it reaches the nearest Ethiopians.\"<ref>''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 5.10</ref> A merchant named Diogenes reported that the Nile's water attracted game such as buffalo.\n[[File:1911Nile.png|left|thumb|upright=0.9|A map of the Nile {{circa|lk=no|1911}}, a time when its entire primary course ran through British occupations, condominiums, colonies, and protectorates{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=693}}]]\n[[Lake Victoria]] was first sighted by Europeans in 1858 when British explorer [[John Hanning Speke]] reached its southern shore while traveling with [[Richard Francis Burton]] to explore central Africa and locate the great lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \"vast expanse of open water\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after the then [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]]. Burton, recovering from illness and resting further south on the shores of [[Lake Tanganyika]], was outraged that Speke claimed to have proved his discovery to be the true source of the Nile when Burton regarded this as still unsettled. A very public quarrel ensued, which sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community and interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery. British explorer and missionary [[David Livingstone]] pushed too far west and entered the [[Congo River]] system instead. It was ultimately Welsh-American explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] who confirmed Speke's discovery, circumnavigating Lake Victoria and reporting the great outflow at [[Ripon Falls]] on the lake's northern shore.\n\nEuropean involvement in Egypt goes back to the time of [[Napoleon]].  [[Laird Shipyard]] of [[Liverpool]] sent an iron steamer to the Nile in the 1830s. With the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|British takeover of Egypt]] in the 1882, more British river steamers followed.\n\nThe Nile is the area's natural navigation channel, giving access to Khartoum and Sudan by steamer. The [[Siege of Khartoum]] was broken with purpose-built [[sternwheelers]] shipped from England and steamed up the river to retake the city. After this came regular steam navigation of the river. With [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty|British Forces in Egypt]] in the [[World War I|First World War]] and the inter-war years, river steamers provided both security and sightseeing to the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. Steam navigation remained integral to the two countries as late as 1962. Sudan steamer traffic was a lifeline as few railways or roads were built in that country. Most paddle steamers have been retired to shorefront service, but modern diesel tourist boats remain on the river.\n\n[[File:Village on the Nile, 1891.jpg|thumb|Village on the Nile, 1891]]\n\n=== Since 1950 ===\n[[File:KageraRuvubu.jpg|thumb|right|The confluence of the [[Kagera river|Kagera]] and [[Ruvubu river|Ruvubu]] rivers near [[Rusumo Falls]], part of the Nile's upper reaches]]\n[[File:Nile03(js).jpg|thumb|[[Dhows]] on the Nile]] [[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|The Nile passes through Cairo, Egypt's capital city.]]\nThe Nile has long been used to transport goods along its length. Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river, and down river using the flow of the river.\nWhile most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the [[Aswan High Dam]] ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The rivers's flow is disturbed at several points by the [[Cataracts of the Nile]], which are sections of faster-flowing water with many small islands, shallow water, and rocks, which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The [[Sudd]] wetlands in Sudan also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impede water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to canalize (the [[Jonglei Canal]]) to bypass the swamps.<ref>{{cite book |last= Shahin |first= Mamdouh |title= Hydrology and Water Resources of Africa |year= 2002 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 1-4020-0866-X |pages= 286\u2013287 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmdYFTlcSgEC |access-date= 25 July 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905222900/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmdYFTlcSgEC |archive-date= 5 September 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 \"Big Canal To Change Course of Nile River\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905230928/https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 |date=5 September 2015 }}.

The first cataract, the closest to the mouth of the river, is at Aswan, north of the Aswan Dam. This part of the river is a regular tourist route, with cruise ships and traditional wooden sailing boats known as [[felucca]]s. Many cruise ships ply the route between Luxor and Aswan, stopping at [[Edfu]] and [[Kom Ombo]] along the way. Security concerns have limited cruising on the northernmost portion for many years.\n\nA computer simulation study to plan the economic development of the Nile was directed by H.A.W. Morrice and W.N.

M.P. Barnett directed the software development and computer operations. The calculations were enabled by accurate monthly inflow data collected for 50 years. The underlying principle was the use of over-year storage, to conserve water from rainy years for use in dry years. Irrigation, navigation and other needs were considered. Each computer run postulated a set of reservoirs and operating equations for the release of water as a function of the month and the levels upstream. The behavior that would have resulted given the inflow data was modeled. Over 600 models were run. Recommendations were made to the Sudanese authorities. The calculations were run on an IBM 650 computer. Simulation studies to design water resources are discussed further in the article on [[hydrology transport model]]s, that have been used since the 1980s to analyze water quality.\n\nDespite the development of many reservoirs, drought during the 1980s led to widespread starvation in Ethiopia and Sudan, but Egypt was nourished by water impounded in [[Lake Nasser]].

When the Jesuits were expelled from the country, he too had to leave and did so via [[Massaua]] and [[Suakin]]. \"He was the best expert on Ethiopian matters.

Although Bruce would not be confused with \"a great scholar or a judicious critic, few books of equal compass are equally entertaining; and few such monuments exist of the energy and enterprise of a single traveller\" (DNB). \"The result of his travels was a very great enrichment of the knowledge of geography and ethnography\" (Cox II, p. 389.) Bruce was one of the earliest westerners to search for the source of the Nile. In November 1770 he reached the source of the Blue Nile, and though he acknowledged that the White Nile was the larger stream, he claimed that the Blue Nile was the Nile of the ancients and that he was thus the discoverer of its source. The account of his travels was written twelve years after his journey and without reference to his journals, which gave critics grounds for disbelief, but the substantial accuracy of the book has since been amply demonstrated.\n\n'''1800\u20131850'''\n* ''Egypt And Mohammed Ali, Or Travels in the Valley of The Nile'', [[James Augustus St. John]], Longman, London, 1834\n\n:St. John traveled extensively in Egypt and [[Nubia]] in 1832\u201333, mainly on foot.

In 1848, he left the Egyptian service and established himself at El Obeid as a trader and was, at the same time made British Consul for the Sudan. In 1853, he removed to [[Khartoum]] and became an ivory trader. He traveled extensively in the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr-el-Ghazal]] region, then almost unknown, exploring the [[Jur River|Jur]], [[Yalo]] and other affluents of the [[Ghazal]] and in 1858 he penetrated the [[Zande people|Niam-Niam]] country. Petherick's additions to the knowledge of natural history were considerable, being responsible for the discovery of a number of new species. In 1859, he returned to England where he became acquainted with [[John Speke]], then arranging for an expedition to discover the source of the Nile. While in England, Petherick married and published this account of his travels.

The last part of the approximately {{convert|200|km|sigfig=2|sp=us}} river section starts from the western shores of the lake and flows at first to the west until just south of [[Masindi Port]], where the river turns north, then makes a great half circle to the east and north until [[Karuma Falls]]. For the remaining part it flows merely westerly through the [[Murchison Falls]] until it reaches the very northern shores of [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] where it forms a significant [[river delta]]. The lake itself is on the border of [[DR Congo]], but the Nile is not a border river at this point. After leaving Lake Albert, the river continues north through Uganda and is known as the [[Albert Nile]].\n\n=== In South Sudan ===\nThe Nile river flows into [[South Sudan]] just south of [[Nimule]], where it is known as the [[White Nile|Bahr al Jabal]] (\"Mountain River\"{{refn|Arabic ''bahr'' can refer to either seas or large rivers.<ref name=\"EB-name\"/>}}). Just south of the town it has the [[confluence]] with the [[Achwa River]]. The [[Bahr el Ghazal River|Bahr al Ghazal]], itself {{convert|716|km|sp=us}} long, joins the Bahr al Jabal at a small lagoon called [[Lake No]], after which the Nile becomes known as the ''Bahr al Abyad'', or the [[White Nile]], from the whitish [[clay]] suspended in its waters. When the [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]] it leaves a rich silty deposit which fertilizes the soil. The Nile no longer floods in Egypt since the completion of the [[Aswan Dam]] in 1970. An [[anabranch]] river, the [[Bahr el Zeraf]], flows out of the Nile's Bahr al Jabal section and rejoins the White Nile.\n\nThe flow rate of the Bahr al Jabal at [[Mongalla, South Sudan]] is almost constant throughout the year and averages {{convert|1048|m3/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}. After Mongalla, the Bahr Al Jabal enters the enormous swamps of the [[Sudd]] region of South Sudan. More than half of the Nile's water is lost in this swamp to [[evaporation]] and [[transpiration]]. The average flow rate of the White Nile at the tails of the swamps is about {{convert|510|m3/s|sigfig=2|abbr=on|sp=us}}. From here it soon meets with the [[Sobat River]] at [[Malakal]].

One is that the integrated drainage of the Nile is of young age and that the Nile basin was formerly broken into series of separate basins, only the most northerly of which fed a river following the present course of the Nile in Egypt and Sudan. Rushdi Said postulated that Egypt itself supplied most of the waters of the Nile during the early part of its history.<ref name=Said1981>Said, R. (1981). ''The geological evolution of the River Nile''. [[Springer Verlag]].</ref>\n\nThe other theory is that the drainage from Ethiopia via rivers equivalent to the Blue Nile, the Atbara and the [[Tekez\u00e9 River|Takazze]] flowed to the Mediterranean via the Egyptian Nile since well back into [[Tertiary]] times.<ref name=WW1980>Williams, M.A.J.; Williams, F.

The River Atbara overflowed its closed basin during the wet periods that occurred about 100,000 to 120,000 years ago. The Blue Nile connected to the main Nile during the 70,000\u201380,000 years B.P. wet period. The White Nile system in Bahr El Arab and White Nile Rifts remained a closed lake until the connection of the Victoria Nile to the main system some 12,500 years ago during the [[African humid period]].\n\n=== Role in the founding of Egyptian civilization ===\n[[File:Dhows on the Nile.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A [[felucca]] traversing the Nile near Aswan]]\n\nThe Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that \"Egypt was the gift of the Nile\". An unending source of sustenance, it played a crucial role in the development of Egyptian civilization. Because the river overflowed its banks annually and deposited new layers of silt, the surrounding land was very fertile. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians cultivated and traded [[wheat]], [[flax]], [[papyrus]] and other crops around the Nile. Wheat was a crucial crop in the famine-plagued Middle East. This trading system secured Egypt's diplomatic relationships with other countries, and contributed to economic stability. Far-reaching trade has been carried on along the Nile since ancient times. A tune, [[Hymn to the Nile]], was created and sung by the ancient Egyptian peoples about the flooding of the Nile River and all of the miracles it brought to Ancient Egyptian civilization.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://arcjohn.wordpress.com/89-2/|title=Hymn to the Nile|date=23 March 2010|publisher=ARCJOHN|access-date=20 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123133714/https://arcjohn.wordpress.com/89-2/|archive-date=23 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Domestic buffalo|Water buffalo]] were introduced from Asia and the Assyrians introduced [[camel]]s in the 7th century BC.

The Nile was also a convenient and efficient means of transportation for people and goods.\n\nThe Nile was also an important part of ancient Egyptian spiritual life. [[Hapi (Nile god)|Hapi]] was the god of the annual floods, and both he and the [[pharaoh]] were thought to control the flooding. The Nile was considered to be a causeway from life to death and the afterlife. The east was thought of as a place of birth and growth, and the west was considered the place of death, as the god [[Ra]], the Sun, underwent birth, death, and resurrection each day as he crossed the sky. Thus, all tombs were west of the Nile, because the Egyptians believed that in order to enter the afterlife, they had to be buried on the side that symbolized death.\n\nAs the Nile was such an important factor in Egyptian life, the ancient calendar was even based on the three cycles of the Nile. These seasons, each consisting of four months of thirty days each, were called [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]], [[Season of the Emergence|Peret]], and [[Shemu]]. Akhet, which means inundation, was the time of the year when the Nile flooded, leaving several layers of fertile soil behind, aiding in agricultural growth.<ref name=\"SpringerMorris2010\">{{cite book|last1=Springer|first1=Lisa|author2=Neil Morris|title=Art and Culture of Ancient Egypt|year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4358-3589-4|page=8}}</ref> Peret was the growing season, and Shemu, the last season, was the harvest season when there were no rains.<ref name=\"SpringerMorris2010\"/>\n\n=== Search for the source of the Nile ===\n[[File:JH Speke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Hanning Speke|John&nbsp;Hanning&nbsp;Speke]]&nbsp;{{circa|lk=no|1863}}.

Various expeditions failed to determine the river's [[source (river or stream)|source]]. [[Agatharcides]] records that in the time of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], a military expedition had penetrated far enough along the course of the Blue Nile to determine that the summer floods were caused by heavy seasonal rainstorms in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], but no European of antiquity is known to have reached [[Lake Tana]].\n\nThe [[Tabula Rogeriana]] depicted the source as three lakes in 1154.\n\nEuropeans began to learn about the origins of the Nile in the fourteenth century when the Pope sent monks as emissaries to Mongolia who passed India, the Middle East and Africa, and described being told of the source of the Nile in Abyssinia (Ethiopia)<ref name=\"THE TRAVELS OF JOHN DE MARIGNOLLI\">{{cite book |last1=Yule |first1=Henry |title=Sir Henry Yule, Cathay and the way thither: being a collection of medieval notices of China Vol. II (1913\u201316) |publisher=Hakluyt Society |location=London |pages=209\u2013269 |url=https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/marignolli.html |access-date=18 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122140845/http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/marignolli.html |archive-date=22 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Oestigaard |first1=Terje |last2=Gedef |first2=Abawa Firew |title=The Source of the Blue Nile: Water Rituals and Traditions in the Lake Tana |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4438-6791-7 |pages=36 |url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=jidQBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36 |access-date=18 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181218193346/https://books.google.ch/books?id=jidQBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36 |archive-date=18 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Later in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, travelers to Ethiopia visited Lake Tana and the source of the Blue Nile in the mountains south of the lake. Although [[James Bruce]] claimed to be the first European to have visited the headwaters,<ref>[[Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile]]</ref> modern writers give the credit to the [[Jesuit]] [[Pedro P\u00e1ez]]. P\u00e1ez's account of the source of the Nile<ref>''History of Ethiopia'', circa 1622</ref> is a long and vivid account of Ethiopia.

Telles also used his account.\n\nThe White Nile was even less understood. The ancients mistakenly believed that the [[Niger River]] represented the upper reaches of the White Nile. For example, [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that the Nile had its origins \"in a mountain of lower [[Mauretania]]\", flowed above ground for \"many days\" distance, then went underground, reappeared as a large lake in the territories of the [[Masaesyli]], then sank again below the desert to flow underground \"for a distance of 20 days' journey till it reaches the nearest Ethiopians.\"<ref>''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 5.10</ref> A merchant named Diogenes reported that the Nile's water attracted game such as buffalo.\n[[File:1911Nile.png|left|thumb|upright=0.9|A map of the Nile {{circa|lk=no|1911}}, a time when its entire primary course ran through British occupations, condominiums, colonies, and protectorates{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=693}}]]\n[[Lake Victoria]] was first sighted by Europeans in 1858 when British explorer [[John Hanning Speke]] reached its southern shore while traveling with [[Richard Francis Burton]] to explore central Africa and locate the great lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \"vast expanse of open water\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after the then [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]]. Burton, recovering from illness and resting further south on the shores of [[Lake Tanganyika]], was outraged that Speke claimed to have proved his discovery to be the true source of the Nile when Burton regarded this as still unsettled. A very public quarrel ensued, which sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community and interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery. British explorer and missionary [[David Livingstone]] pushed too far west and entered the [[Congo River]] system instead. It was ultimately Welsh-American explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] who confirmed Speke's discovery, circumnavigating Lake Victoria and reporting the great outflow at [[Ripon Falls]] on the lake's northern shore.\n\nEuropean involvement in Egypt goes back to the time of [[Napoleon]].  [[Laird Shipyard]] of [[Liverpool]] sent an iron steamer to the Nile in the 1830s. With the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|British takeover of Egypt]] in the 1882, more British river steamers followed.\n\nThe Nile is the area's natural navigation channel, giving access to Khartoum and Sudan by steamer. The [[Siege of Khartoum]] was broken with purpose-built [[sternwheelers]] shipped from England and steamed up the river to retake the city. After this came regular steam navigation of the river. With [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty|British Forces in Egypt]] in the [[World War I|First World War]] and the inter-war years, river steamers provided both security and sightseeing to the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. Steam navigation remained integral to the two countries as late as 1962. Sudan steamer traffic was a lifeline as few railways or roads were built in that country. Most paddle steamers have been retired to shorefront service, but modern diesel tourist boats remain on the river.\n\n[[File:Village on the Nile, 1891.jpg|thumb|Village on the Nile, 1891]]\n\n=== Since 1950 ===\n[[File:KageraRuvubu.jpg|thumb|right|The confluence of the [[Kagera river|Kagera]] and [[Ruvubu river|Ruvubu]] rivers near [[Rusumo Falls]], part of the Nile's upper reaches]]\n[[File:Nile03(js).jpg|thumb|[[Dhows]] on the Nile]] [[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|The Nile passes through Cairo, Egypt's capital city.]]\nThe Nile has long been used to transport goods along its length. Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river, and down river using the flow of the river.\nWhile most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the [[Aswan High Dam]] ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The rivers's flow is disturbed at several points by the [[Cataracts of the Nile]], which are sections of faster-flowing water with many small islands, shallow water, and rocks, which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The [[Sudd]] wetlands in Sudan also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impede water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to canalize (the [[Jonglei Canal]]) to bypass the swamps.<ref>{{cite book |last= Shahin |first= Mamdouh |title= Hydrology and Water Resources of Africa |year= 2002 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 1-4020-0866-X |pages= 286\u2013287 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmdYFTlcSgEC |access-date= 25 July 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905222900/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmdYFTlcSgEC |archive-date= 5 September 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 \"Big Canal To Change Course of Nile River\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905230928/https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 |date=5 September 2015 }}.

The first cataract, the closest to the mouth of the river, is at Aswan, north of the Aswan Dam. This part of the river is a regular tourist route, with cruise ships and traditional wooden sailing boats known as [[felucca]]s. Many cruise ships ply the route between Luxor and Aswan, stopping at [[Edfu]] and [[Kom Ombo]] along the way.

M.P. Barnett directed the software development and computer operations. The calculations were enabled by accurate monthly inflow data collected for 50 years. The underlying principle was the use of over-year storage, to conserve water from rainy years for use in dry years. Irrigation, navigation and other needs were considered. Each computer run postulated a set of reservoirs and operating equations for the release of water as a function of the month and the levels upstream. The behavior that would have resulted given the inflow data was modeled. Over 600 models were run. Recommendations were made to the Sudanese authorities. The calculations were run on an IBM 650 computer. Simulation studies to design water resources are discussed further in the article on [[hydrology transport model]]s, that have been used since the 1980s to analyze water quality.\n\nDespite the development of many reservoirs, drought during the 1980s led to widespread starvation in Ethiopia and Sudan, but Egypt was nourished by water impounded in [[Lake Nasser]].

When the Jesuits were expelled from the country, he too had to leave and did so via [[Massaua]] and [[Suakin]]. \"He was the best expert on Ethiopian matters.

Bruce was one of the earliest westerners to search for the source of the Nile. In November 1770 he reached the source of the Blue Nile, and though he acknowledged that the White Nile was the larger stream, he claimed that the Blue Nile was the Nile of the ancients and that he was thus the discoverer of its source.

He traveled extensively in the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr-el-Ghazal]] region, then almost unknown, exploring the [[Jur River|Jur]], [[Yalo]] and other affluents of the [[Ghazal]] and in 1858 he penetrated the [[Zande people|Niam-Niam]] country. Petherick's additions to the knowledge of natural history were considerable, being responsible for the discovery of a number of new species. In 1859, he returned to England where he became acquainted with [[John Speke]], then arranging for an expedition to discover the source of the Nile. While in England, Petherick married and published this account of his travels. He got the idea to join Speke in his travels, and in this volume is an actual subscription and list of subscribers to raise money to send Petherick to join Speke. His subsequent adventures as a consul in Africa were published in a later work.\n* ''Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile'', [[John Hanning Speke]]. [[William Blackwood]], Edinburgh, 1863; Harper & Brothers, New York; 1864\n\n:Speke had previously made an expedition with Sir Richard Burton under the auspices of the Indian government, during which Speke was convinced that he had discovered the source of the Nile. Burton, however, disagreed and ridiculed Speke's account. Speke set off on another expedition, recounted here, in the company of Captain Grant. During the course of this expedition he not only produced further evidence for his discoveries but he also met (later Sir) [[Samuel Baker|Samuel]] and [[Florence Baker]]. Speke and Burton provided them with essential information which helped Baker in the discovery of the [[Albert Nyanza]].<ref>Dorothy Middleton, 'Baker, Florence Barbara Maria, Lady Baker (1841\u20131916)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/42346, accessed 11 Sept 2015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155059/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/42346 |date=24 September 2015 }}</ref> The importance of Speke's discoveries can hardly be overestimated.

Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{under construction}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = \n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], United States\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show'' (also known as ''The Island of Sanity'')\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = {{CAN}}\n|prevshow    =Greenline \n|website     = \n|spouse=Deborah Green|awards=}}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[radio personality]],<ref name=\"OCOct05\">{{cite news | title=Imagine Lowell Green stoned: Then think about farm animals | newspaper=Ottawa Citizen | date=7 October 2005 | page=F1 | first=Kelly | last=Egan }}</ref> [[journalist]], and [[author]], best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHonours and awards:Added citation.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Green"}

The railway was at this time under the direct control of the Military Department. In 1897, it came under the control of the Civil Department. It was the intention at one time to hand it over to the private railway company organized in Japan for the purpose of completing the Formosa railway system. The private railway company, however, failed to obtain public support, and in 1898 the Formosan government announced its intention of carrying on the work itself. Under the able direction of Chief Engineer Hasegawa the plans were soon formulated, and in 1899 work was commenced on the southern line from Takow north to Tainan, a distance of 28 miles. This section was completed in November, 1900. The Kelung and Shinchiku (Teckcham), lines were repaired, much rolling stock was added, and in the fall of 1900 work was commenced on the short branch line from [[Taipei Railway Station|Taihoku]], (Taipeh) to [[Tamsui Station|Tamsui]], (Hobe), which was completed in June 1901.

Commuter trains made all suburban stops, while [[Amtrak]]-like expresses stopped only at major hubs. These days, most East Coast services terminate at Shulin Station, which is the location of a major TRA yard. West Coast services mainly terminate at Qidu Station, which is the location of another large rail yard.\n\n===Railway facility relocation===\n[[File:TRA EM403 at Taoyuan Station 20120722.jpg|thumb|[[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]] commuters wait for the South African [[Union Carriage & Wagon]]-built [[Taiwan Railway EMU400 series|EMU400]] to Qidu.

Although TRA\u2019s long-distance services potentially competes with HSR, Taiwan\u2019s HSR is focused on origin-destination markets over 100 miles<ref>Bureau of Taiwan High Speed Rail, Ministry of Transportation and Communication. Taiwan North-South High Speed Railway Plan (Unpublished Presentation). Banqiao, Taiwan, January 2010.</ref> like Taipei-[[Taichung]] (HSR&nbsp;\u2013 50 minutes; TRA&nbsp;\u2013 110 minutes), whereas TRA serves shorter-haul trips like Taipei-Hsinchu (35 versus 60 minutes).\nHSR serves Taipei, Banqiao, and Nangang TRA interchanges via shared corridors. Except for Taipei, HSR stations are located out-of-town, minimizing environmental impacts and property acquisition, maximizing economic development potential, and allowing low curvature alignments.<ref>Bureau of Taiwan High Speed Rail, Ministry of Transportation and Communication. Taiwan South-North High Speed Railway&nbsp;\u2013 Introduction to Mechanical and Electrical Systems Engineering. Banqiao, Taiwan, August 2008.</ref> Commuter rail connects HSR with established provincial downtowns, solving \u201clast mile\u201d problems.\n\nIn Hsinchu, HSR and TRA stations are three miles apart. Parts of TRA's [[Neiwan line]] were electrified and rebuilt as a modern commuter railroad, costing US$280 million to connect Hsinchu's historic downtown with the HSR. Connections generate benefits for both modes and catalyze development near HSR stations, much as Interstate interchanges attracted economic activity. This is a transit-oriented version of [[Massachusetts Route 128|Beltway success stories]] played out across 1980s America.\n\n==Infrastructure and scheduling==\n[[File:Fig2g 0508.jpg|thumb|Train terminations and transfers occur at interchanges where double island platforms and full crossovers are provided. The Japanese [[Tokyu Car Corporation|Tokyu]] [[Taiwan Railway DR3000 series|DR3000]] DMU is departing from Shulin station, using crossovers for yard access.]]\n[[File:Fig2f 0342.jpg|thumb|TRA's infrastructure designs are targeted towards scheduled movements. The South Korean [[Hyundai Rotem|Daewoo]] [[Taiwan Railway EMU500 series|EMU500]] commuter unit is being prepared on [[Hsinchu railway station|Hsinchu]]'s middle track while an intercity train departs.]]\n\nTRA's infrastructure might be described as making up for lower track miles with sidings. TRA operated single-track sections on busy mainlines until 1998. Double-track sections can accommodate trains at different speeds; passing movements don't interference with opposing traffic, allowing scheduled throughputs of ~15 trains per hour per direction. Scheduling practices assume staff can respond to\nunforeseen delays and out-of-sequence trains by dynamically utilizing available infrastructure.\n\nTRA has recently installed advanced signalling on the northernmost portion of the [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|West Coast line]] around Taipei, and has performed extensive capacity analysis to maximize train throughputs.<ref>Lai, Yung-Cheng;Wang, Szu-Han;Jong, Jyh-Cherng.

Some stations have an [[island platform]] serving middle siding tracks, and straight-through outside bypass tracks. Schedules provide extra dwell time for trains to hold until an express passes, also serving as en route recovery time, improving reliability. Some stations in single-track territory feature three passing tracks, allowing freight or other equipment to be stowed while opposing passenger trains pass one another. Close proximity of sidings allow TRA to squeeze 5~6 tph (both directions, mixed traffic) out of single-tracks.<ref>Taiwan Railway Company LTD. \u201cHow One\u201d Taiwan Travel Passport (Taiwan Railways Administration Passenger Schedule), Version 9. Banqiao, Taiwan, January 15, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Double island platforms at transfer stations===\nTrain terminations and transfers (express/local, branch/mainline) occur at [[Interchange station|strategic interchanges]] where\ndouble island platforms and full [[Railroad switch#Crossover|crossover]]s are provided. Platforms between siding and mainline\nprovide [[Cross-platform interchange|cross-platform transfer]]s, and allow staff to clear terminating trains without obstructing mainline.\nWhere many trains originate/terminate, additional platforms are provided. Crossovers allow convenient\nlayover access and easy [[Multiple unit|multiple-unit]] (MU) reversals.\n\n===Side platforms and through tracks===\nIsland platforms are not ideal for vertical passenger flow. Side platforms allow direct access from stationhouse through [[fare control]]. Through track serves the stationhouse at major stations, where most expresses stop. Middle bypass tracks are available for switching, temporary equipment storage, train preparation, and allows passenger trains to pass freights.\nStationhouses are usually on the northbound side (up direction, to Taipei), where originating passengers are voluminous. At minor stations, mainline serves the island platform; locals serve the stationhouse while waiting for overtaking expresses.\n\n===Explicit scheduling and dispatching priorities===\nLike classic American railroads, TRA's published timetable specifies train class (thus dispatching priority). Premium-fare expresses, like [[Tze-Chiang Train|Tze-Chiang]], have highest priority and almost never take sidings.<ref name=\"University Railway Research Association 2009\"/> Customers understand the system, and aren't surprised when lower priority trains are held, allowing others to pass. [[Train dispatcher|Dispatching]] decisions are fairly straightforward; even when trains are out of sequence, stationmasters wouldn't hesitate to hold trains if releasing them could delay a subsequent Tze-Chiang. Close proximity of sidings mean unscheduled holds are likely short, usually less than 5 minutes.\n\n===Schedule, ridership pattern, and demographics===\nTRA's schedules are not tightly constrained by [[Clock-face scheduling|clock face patterns]] or policy headways. Extra trains and cars are added on peak travel days to accommodate holiday traffic. 6~8% more departures are scheduled on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. TRA riders span the full gamut including lower-income (students, young adults) and minorities ([[Hakka people|Hakka]], [[Taiwanese aborigines]]) but also choice riders (vacationing families, foreign tourists, monthly commuters). Elderly passengers are common, but wheelchair passengers are rare; not all stations are handicap accessible and not all rolling stock are level-boarding.\nFare differentials between expresses and locals provide market differentiation. HSR ridership is observably more affluent, capturing many former airline passengers.<ref>Agence France-Presse. Airlines Hit as Taiwan Bullet Train Takes Off.

TRA's practices are like JR's&nbsp;\u2013 somewhat labour-intensive, but immediate on-site accountability and close supervision contribute to high service quality, good delay-recovery capabilities, skills to execute complex maneuvers, and throughputs closer to theoretical line capacity than otherwise achievable.\n\n===Stationmasters, train regulation, and dwell process===\nMany TRA stations have \"stationmaster duty offices.\" Stationmasters (their deputies, or platform staff) perform train regulation and signalling functions right from the platform, and provide train crew oversight. Two station crewmembers work busy locations, one per direction. They sound a whistle to warn waiting passengers of imminent arrivals. Passengers standing in yellow danger zones are asked to step back. As trains approach, they hand-signal drivers. Unreserved trains (without assigned cars) berth close to fare control, while expresses berth according to platform car markers, minimizing onboard baggage-carrying by passengers looking for assigned seats.\nStationmasters may indirectly reduce overruns by providing immediate accountability.\n\nTRA's stationmasters and conductors jointly manage dwell time, like their counterparts at LIRR's Jamaica. Stationmasters regulate trains by enforcing correct train sequences and departure times; holding to time is actually a legal requirement.<ref>{{cite book |trans-title=Law and Regulations Database of the Republic of China.

Once conductors close train doors, stationmasters give the \"right away\" using platform-mounted equipment. After departure,\nstationmasters remain on platforms, visually inspecting departing trains.\n\n===Conductors as captains===\nOn board, conductors' primary responsibilities are not ticket examinations&nbsp;\u2013 station fare controls provide coverage. Instead, conductors operate doors and announcement systems, ensure onboard safety, sellonboard tickets, provide customer information and assistance, supervise onboard crews, perform emergency procedures, and troubleshoot equipment where possible.

Train attendants offer [[Bento|bento boxes]], drinks, souvenirs, and [[Suncake (Taiwan)|Sun Cakes]] (traditional gifts for visiting friends) from small carts.\n\n==Ticketing==\n[[File:TRA BaDu Station Gate.jpg|thumb|Taiwan Railways Administration faregates and [[Automated fare collection system|Automated Fare Collection (AFC)]] hardware at [[Badu Station]].]]\n[[File:TRA Tze-Chiang Limited Express Taipei-Tainan ticket 20071104.jpg|thumb|Larger format Taiwan Railways Administration ticket used by [[Tze-Chiang Train|Tzu-Chiang]] express train with seat reservations (Car 6 Seat 15), issued by the AFC system.]]\n[[File:TRA Taipei Station Express-only ATVM 20120729.jpg|thumb|Taiwan Railway's second generation ticket vending machine, capable of credit-card processing and reserved-seating ticket issuance seen at Taipei Main Station.]]\n[[File:EasyCard and Taiwan Easy Go reader at TRA Songshan Station 20100608.jpg|thumb|Taiwan Railway's [[Automated fare collection system|smart card]] ticket readers in [[Songshan Station]] for Taipei City's [[EasyCard]] (left) and Taiwan Province's Easy Go (right). The ticket readers were an interim solution before full implementation of integrated ticket gates.]]\n\nTRA's tickets were printed on traditional [[Edmondson railway ticket|Edmondson presses]] until Japan's [[NEC]] supplied a [[Computer reservations system|computerized ticketing and reservation system]] in the late 1980s. Almost all stations are divided into [[Paid area|paid]] (platform) and unpaid (waiting room) areas. Normally, ticket examiners govern platform access, checking and punching tickets as passengers enter. [[Conductor (transportation)|Conductors]] perform onboard ticket checks near peak load points or every ~100 miles, verifying that passengers hold train-class appropriate tickets, and dispense step-up and zone extension fares from portable ticket printers. Examiners also control access to unpaid areas at destinations, ensuring all passengers paid full distance-based fares. Used tickets are collected and not returned to passengers unless cancelled by stamps (similar to postmarks). Those arriving without appropriate tickets (i.e. requiring \"fare adjustments\") are assessed 50% [[Penalty fare|penalties]], giving passengers incentives to find conductors on board to purchase step-up fares. Tickets are validated at origin, destination, and sometimes en route; [[Fare evasion|evasion]] thus would require elaborate two-ticket schemes or exiting from paid area without going through [[fare control]]. Fare evasion rates are thought to be low. [[Proof-of-payment]] methods are not used. \n\n===Fare structure===\nTRA's passenger fares are highly regulated and strictly distance/train-class based (short trips <6.3 miles require 34~73 cents minimum fare.) Express fares are 11.7 cents (per passenger-mile); locals are 5.5 cents.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Taiwan Railways Administration |trans-title=Ticket Policy Information: Fare Computation Principle |script-title=zh:\u8eca\u7968\u8cc7\u8a0a&nbsp;\u2013 \u7968\u50f9\u8a08\u7b97\u539f\u5247 |url=http://service.tra.gov.tw/tw/CP/11333/tickets-1.aspx |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> Within Taipei municipal zone, single trips are 58 cents regardless of distance/class. Unlike HSR, no time- or demand-based off-peak discounts are offered. Periodic (limited-ride) commutation\ntickets and multi-ride carnets are available. Fares are generally competitive with private commuter and\nintercity buses. Express trains operate with higher [[Passenger load factor|load factors]] and are more profitable.\n\n===Fare validation===\nFare validation requires substantial infrastructure (paid/unpaid areas), labour-intensive [[manual fare collection|manual ticket examinations]], and consequent speed-accuracy trade-offs. During the 2000s, TRA incrementally replaced older thermal ticket printers with [[Automated fare collection system|automated fare collection]] (AFC) devices using magnetic-backed stock. Busy stations have faregates to speed up validation. Tickets can be inserted in any orientation. Gates align, check, and mechanically punch tickets prior to opening. Validations are fast and can be \"[[Pipeline (computing)|pipelined]]\" or \"stacked\" (i.e. following passenger can insert ticket while previous passenger is proceeding through the gate). Passenger counting sensors quickly close gates when as many passengers entered as valid tickets processed. When exiting, faregates collect and cancel single trip tickets.\n\nHowever, many locations still use heat-sensitive tickets without ATC, requiring one ticket examiner per fare control. Examiners punch and collect non-magnetic tickets, provide customer information and assistance, troubleshoot AFC malfunctions (e.g. mutilated tickets), and return cancelled (stamped) tickets to passengers requiring proof-of-travel for expense claims. TRA volunteers (with yellow vest) staff some gates. Volunteers, like America's [[auxiliary police]] and volunteer firefighters, include carefully selected and specifically trained members of the public, and retired industry personnel.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tsay |first1=Bai-Ling (\u8521\u767e\u9748) |trans-title=93 Years Old Deng Yo-Tsai, Taiwan Railways\u2019 Oldest Ticket-Punching Volunteer |script-title=zh:93\u6b72\u9127\u6709\u624d&nbsp;\u2013 \u53f0\u9435\u6700\u8001\u526a\u7968\u5fd7\u5de5 |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2010/new/sep/12/today-life12.htm |work=[[Liberty Times]] |location=[[Hualien City|Hualien]] |date=September 12, 2010 |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> They assist passengers, sometimes exercising Japanese or English language skills,<ref>User e88111 from Kaohsiung.

Unreserved single or day-return tickets must be purchased on the day of travel (to prevent ticket reuse), leading to ticket queues at peak commuter periods. Passengers purchasing advance tickets can delay entire queues, causing imminent train departures to be missed. To maximize passenger throughput, separate ticket windows provide train information, today's tickets, and advance or commutation tickets. Some daily ticket windows only accept cash, further decreasing transaction times. Ticket windows at busy stations can be dynamically switched between different functions, minimizing daily ticket queues.\n\n===Fare vending machines===\nEarly machines designed primarily for commuters are essentially receipt printers,\naccepting only coins (no bills) and prepaid magnetic [[Employer transportation benefits in the United States|TransitChek]]-like cards&nbsp;\u2013 not credit cards.\nPassengers must first insert coins (amount deposited is displayed), then press numerous lighted buttons sequentially to specify traveller count, train class, single/return/concessionary, and destination. Buttons light up only when adequate coins are inserted. TVMs sell only unreserved single/round-trips to local destinations (<50 miles) from the current station. Earlier button presses constrain subsequent choices: destinations for which insufficient fares were paid (in selected train class) do not activate and have no effect.\n\nThis machine's target audience is regular travellers who already know required fares. Passenger experiences for first-time customers can be confusing, but once customers learn this TVM, unreserved day ticket transactions are processed much faster than on typical full-feature machines. Machines need only electricity (not network connections) and staff to replace ticket stock, remove coins, and clear jams.\nLike [[Vending machine|soda machines]], they are robust, self-contained, and have been deployed to remote locations.\n\nLong distance TVMs selling advance-purchase, reserved-seating, and prepaid internet/phone tickets were developed later. These more complex machines, functionally similar to Amtrak's [[Amtrak Arrow Reservation System|Quik-Trak]], are available at principal West coast stations.\n\n===Contactless Smartcard fare payment===\nTRTC pioneered transitcards in 2000 via affiliate [http://www.tscc.com.tw Taipei Smart Card Corporation], which performs backoffice functions for TRTC, Taipei's [[Taipei Joint Bus System]] (market-sharing conference) group of bus companies, and other EasyCard merchants. In 2008, TRTC assisted TRA in implementing entry-exit smartcard fare collection<ref>Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation. Annual Report 2008. Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation, Taipei, 2009.</ref> for local travel within Taipei's metropolitan zone (Keelung-[[Zhongli District|Zhongli]]), offering 10% discounts from regular local train fares. Smartcard holders can travel on regular local and\nexpress trains, but not Tarokos, sightseeing specials, nor in business class. When travelling on expresses, smartcard seats are unreserved. As expresses are often sold out, EasyCard offers de facto standee discounts.\n\nOrigin/destination validation and existing fare control areas made smartcard implementation easier.\nInstead of punching tickets to enter and relinquishing tickets to exit, users tap-in and tap-out. Faregates are replaced with newer integrated designs as funding allows. In the interim, ticket collectors visually verify each transaction on low-cost stand-alone terminals, allowing rapid deployment.\n\nSmartcard development in Taiwan is currently fluid. With 13 million cards issued, readers for Mifare\nClassic-based EasyCard are already installed at convenience stores like [[FamilyMart|Family Mart]].\nLegislation authorizing \"Third Generation e-Purse\" (stored value limit ~US$300) was passed in March 2010, allowing smartcard payments for low-value non-transportation items, like Hong Kong's Octopus Card. Three major competitors hold regional subway/bus fare collection franchises (Taipei's \"Youyoka\" [[EasyCard]], Mid-Island's [[:zh:\u81fa\u7063\u901a|Taiwan Easy Go]] \"TaiwanTong\", and Kaohsiung's \"I Pass\"), and TRA has active pilots with both EasyCard and TaiwanTong. Taiwan's MOTC expects to eventually integrate all electronic farecard systems nationwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=EasyCard Plan Steaming Ahead|last=Shan|first=Shelley|date=2008-08-08|work=Taipei Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Rail pass===\n{{Main|TR Pass}}\nBesides single ticket, TRA has also been offering various types of rail pass, with which travelers can ride on trains without buying single tickets. Currently, TRA offers [[TR Pass]] to travelers such that they have unlimited ride on trains within the set period. The pass has two versions - the General Pass and the Student Pass. TRA first offered the Student Pass to foreign students in December 2006 in order to attract more foreign visitors. The offer was extended to local students in 2009. Finally, parallel to the Student Pass, a General Pass, which could be used by everyone, was issued in 2010, so as to replace the ineffective \"Round-the Island Pass\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u74b0\u5cf6\u9031\u904a\u7968}}), which had been offered since 1998.\n\nThe Round-the Island Pass had several restrictions making it unpopular. First, holders of the pass must either travel in the clockwise or anti-clockwise direction without traveling backwards. Secondly, travelers could only pick seven stops to get off and visit. Once a traveler has got off in seven stations, the pass became invalid. These restrictions were deemed too restrictive and limited the use of the pass.<ref name=\"Issuing General Pass\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cardu.com.tw/news/detail.php?nt_pk=27&ns_pk=10123 |script-title=zh:\u53f0\u9435\u65b0\u7248TR PASS\u30003\u65e5\u52385\u65e5\u5238\u958b\u8ce3|website=\u5361\u512a\u65b0\u805e\u7db2|language=Chinese}}</ref> After the issue of TR General Pass in 2010, this pass ceased to be issued.\n\n==Passenger information systems and signage==\n[[File:TRA Dasi Station train timetable 20060630.jpg|thumb|Traditional Taiwan Railway acrylic schedule boards at [[Daxi Station]].]]\nTRA takes a holistic and comprehensive approach towards passenger information. Devices used (in both English and Chinese) range from schedule posters, fixed signage to departure monitors and next-train displays.\n[[File:Houtong Station nearby stations.jpg|thumb|Taiwan Railway's large acrylic backlit signs to indicate station or [[interlocking]] names, and distances to previous and next stations, for use by passengers and crew. Note that this sign was from prior to the switchover from [[tongyong pinyin]] to [[hanyu pinyin]].]]\n\n[[Split-flap display|Solari]]-like \"flippy-flippies\" boards, monitors, or smaller LED displays are provided at major terminals and principal stations. One display per control area shows boarding times and track assignments. Delays as short as one minute are posted. Large acrylic signboards show departure times and fares at smaller stations. Ubiquitous clocks throughout stations and facilities make it difficult to find spots where fewer than two clocks are immediately visible.\n\n===Platform signage, next train identifiers===\nBacklit acrylic signs (airport-style with iconic representations) identify platform and carriage numbers, and provide directions to facilities like restrooms and elevators. Boxes display schedules, tourist information, and service change notices. Large signs (legible from passing trains) indicate station names, and distances to previous/next stations, for use by passengers and crew. Platform LED displays provide next train identity, departure time, delay information, and context-sensitive\nmessages, including public service announcements.\n\n===Onboard displays and announcements===\nTRA's mixed fleet ranges from 1960s hauled stock to new [[Taroko Express|Taroko]]s and commuter MUs. Newer trains feature automated display/announcement systems with high-density [[Dot-matrix display|dot-matrix LEDs]] like Taipei's metro. On long-distance coaches with longer time between station stops, scrolling displays are used. Like in Continental Europe, automated onboard announcements are multilingual.\nAnnouncements are in four major languages ([[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[English language|English]]). In rural areas, announcements are also made in local aboriginal languages; Taitung line has the Pangcah/Amis tribal dialect. In unusual situations, conductors can usually make announcements in at least two languages.\n\nTrains lacking automatic train location features are not simple to retrofit. TRA devised low-cost multi-lingual \"announcement boxes\" connected to the public address system, manually triggered by conductors on approach to stations.\n\n===Exterior train identification===\nIdentifying arriving trains quickly and accurately is equally important to employees and passengers.\nClassically, lighted acrylic destination signboards are manually changed at terminals. Recent modernization efforts provided exterior LED displays showing destination, route, [[Train reporting number|train number]], and class. Newest cars have bilingual flexible displays built-in. Train numbers are especially important on expresses, helping customers identify seat reservations.\n\n==Modernisation==\n{{main|Railway reconstruction in Taiwan}}\nUnder the Railway Bureau, many projects have been undertaken to modernise the railway system and improve its efficiency.\n\n[[File:TRA train driver 20111108.jpg|thumb|Still wearing the regulation cap, this Taiwan Railways Administration's Customer Service Attendant had just gone off-duty after a hard day's work.

Fares were set at three times the per-mile cost of ordinary local service, as much as NT$117 for certain origin-destination pairs. On February 20 of the same year, the service was initiated between Taipei and Kaohsiung.\n\nThe first ''Chu-kuang Expresses'' in the 1970s used a variety of different vehicles; although the models vary, but the body are universally white with blue line, with one door per side, and in the interior there are carpets and velvet sofa seats. After the completion of the West Coast line electrification project in 1978, all coach bodies were fully painted into orange livery, and service continued to grow.\n\n1986 saw the introduction of rooftop air-conditioning type ''Chu-kuang'' coaches (10200 series), like the previous launch of 35SPK2200 on the ''[[Fu-Hsing Express]]'', the air conditioner is moved to the stainless steel lightweight roof, and each coach was outfitted with a single door per side (manually operated). In addition, these ''Chu-kuang'' saw introduction of TRA's first disability-accessible coach, the FPK11300 type.\n\n==Vehicles==\nTRA uses a variety of railway vehicles to provide both freight and passenger service.\n\n* '''Diesel electric locomotives''': Primarily road engines and road switchers built by [[Electro-Motive Division]] of the United States, entirely of the EMD \"G\" classes.

Planning for TRA's restructuring had been underway since 2000.\n\nRecent growth in the [[Highway System in Taiwan|highway system]] and increased competition from bus companies and airlines has led to a decline in long-distance rail travel (except during major holidays such as [[Chinese New Year]]), though short and intermediate distance travel is still heavily utilized by commuters and students. The [[Taiwan High Speed Rail|high-speed rail]] line is not run by TRA, and is also a major source of competition. To offset this TRA has begun placing an emphasis on [[tourism]] and short-distance commuter service. This has led to several special tourist trains running to scenic areas and hot springs, the addition of dining cars (originally deemed unnecessary due to Taiwan's relatively small size), and converting several smaller branch lines to attract tourists. Additionally, several new stations have been added in major metropolitan areas, and local commuter service increased.

Taiwan South-North High Speed Railway&nbsp;\u2013 Introduction to Mechanical and Electrical Systems Engineering. Banqiao, Taiwan, August 2008.</ref> Commuter rail connects HSR with established provincial downtowns, solving \u201clast mile\u201d problems.\n\nIn Hsinchu, HSR and TRA stations are three miles apart. Parts of TRA's [[Neiwan line]] were electrified and rebuilt as a modern commuter railroad, costing US$280 million to connect Hsinchu's historic downtown with the HSR. Connections generate benefits for both modes and catalyze development near HSR stations, much as Interstate interchanges attracted economic activity. This is a transit-oriented version of [[Massachusetts Route 128|Beltway success stories]] played out across 1980s America.\n\n==Infrastructure and scheduling==\n[[File:Fig2g 0508.jpg|thumb|Train terminations and transfers occur at interchanges where double island platforms and full crossovers are provided. The Japanese [[Tokyu Car Corporation|Tokyu]] [[Taiwan Railway DR3000 series|DR3000]] DMU is departing from Shulin station, using crossovers for yard access.]]\n[[File:Fig2f 0342.jpg|thumb|TRA's infrastructure designs are targeted towards scheduled movements. The South Korean [[Hyundai Rotem|Daewoo]] [[Taiwan Railway EMU500 series|EMU500]] commuter unit is being prepared on [[Hsinchu railway station|Hsinchu]]'s middle track while an intercity train departs.]]\n\nTRA's infrastructure might be described as making up for lower track miles with sidings. TRA operated single-track sections on busy mainlines until 1998. Double-track sections can accommodate trains at different speeds; passing movements don't interference with opposing traffic, allowing scheduled throughputs of ~15 trains per hour per direction. Scheduling practices assume staff can respond to\nunforeseen delays and out-of-sequence trains by dynamically utilizing available infrastructure.\n\nTRA has recently installed advanced signalling on the northernmost portion of the [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|West Coast line]] around Taipei, and has performed extensive capacity analysis to maximize train throughputs.<ref>Lai, Yung-Cheng;Wang, Szu-Han;Jong, Jyh-Cherng.

Some stations have an [[island platform]] serving middle siding tracks, and straight-through outside bypass tracks. Schedules provide extra dwell time for trains to hold until an express passes, also serving as en route recovery time, improving reliability. Some stations in single-track territory feature three passing tracks, allowing freight or other equipment to be stowed while opposing passenger trains pass one another. Close proximity of sidings allow TRA to squeeze 5~6 tph (both directions, mixed traffic) out of single-tracks.<ref>Taiwan Railway Company LTD. \u201cHow One\u201d Taiwan Travel Passport (Taiwan Railways Administration Passenger Schedule), Version 9. Banqiao, Taiwan, January 15, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Double island platforms at transfer stations===\nTrain terminations and transfers (express/local, branch/mainline) occur at [[Interchange station|strategic interchanges]] where\ndouble island platforms and full [[Railroad switch#Crossover|crossover]]s are provided. Platforms between siding and mainline\nprovide [[Cross-platform interchange|cross-platform transfer]]s, and allow staff to clear terminating trains without obstructing mainline.\nWhere many trains originate/terminate, additional platforms are provided. Crossovers allow convenient\nlayover access and easy [[Multiple unit|multiple-unit]] (MU) reversals.\n\n===Side platforms and through tracks===\nIsland platforms are not ideal for vertical passenger flow. Side platforms allow direct access from stationhouse through [[fare control]]. Through track serves the stationhouse at major stations, where most expresses stop. Middle bypass tracks are available for switching, temporary equipment storage, train preparation, and allows passenger trains to pass freights.\nStationhouses are usually on the northbound side (up direction, to Taipei), where originating passengers are voluminous. At minor stations, mainline serves the island platform; locals serve the stationhouse while waiting for overtaking expresses.\n\n===Explicit scheduling and dispatching priorities===\nLike classic American railroads, TRA's published timetable specifies train class (thus dispatching priority). Premium-fare expresses, like [[Tze-Chiang Train|Tze-Chiang]], have highest priority and almost never take sidings.<ref name=\"University Railway Research Association 2009\"/> Customers understand the system, and aren't surprised when lower priority trains are held, allowing others to pass. [[Train dispatcher|Dispatching]] decisions are fairly straightforward; even when trains are out of sequence, stationmasters wouldn't hesitate to hold trains if releasing them could delay a subsequent Tze-Chiang. Close proximity of sidings mean unscheduled holds are likely short, usually less than 5 minutes.\n\n===Schedule, ridership pattern, and demographics===\nTRA's schedules are not tightly constrained by [[Clock-face scheduling|clock face patterns]] or policy headways. Extra trains and cars are added on peak travel days to accommodate holiday traffic. 6~8% more departures are scheduled on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. TRA riders span the full gamut including lower-income (students, military) and minorities ([[Hakka people|Hakka]], [[Taiwanese aborigines]]) but also choice riders (vacationing families, foreign tourists, monthly commuters). Elderly passengers are common, but wheelchair passengers are rare; not all stations are handicap accessible and not all rolling stock are level-boarding.\nFare differentials between expresses and locals provide market differentiation. HSR ridership is observably more affluent, capturing many former airline passengers.<ref>Agence France-Presse. Airlines Hit as Taiwan Bullet Train Takes Off.

TRA's practices are like JR's&nbsp;\u2013 somewhat labour-intensive, but immediate on-site accountability and close supervision contribute to high service quality, good delay-recovery capabilities, skills to execute complex maneuvers, and throughputs closer to theoretical line capacity than otherwise achievable.\n\n===Stationmasters, train regulation, and dwell process===\nMany TRA stations have \"stationmaster duty offices.\" Stationmasters (their deputies, or platform staff) perform train regulation and signalling functions right from the platform, and provide train crew oversight. Two station crewmembers work busy locations, one per direction. They sound a whistle to warn waiting passengers of imminent arrivals. Passengers standing in yellow danger zones are asked to step back. As trains approach, they hand-signal drivers. Unreserved trains (without assigned cars) berth close to fare control, while expresses berth according to platform car markers, minimizing onboard baggage-carrying by passengers looking for assigned seats.\nStationmasters may indirectly reduce overruns by providing immediate accountability.\n\nTRA's stationmasters and conductors jointly manage dwell time, like their counterparts at LIRR's Jamaica. Stationmasters regulate trains by enforcing correct train sequences and departure times; holding to time is actually a legal requirement.<ref>{{cite book |trans-title=Law and Regulations Database of the Republic of China.

Once conductors close train doors, stationmasters give the \"right away\" using platform-mounted equipment. After departure,\nstationmasters remain on platforms, visually inspecting departing trains.\n\n===Conductors as captains===\nOn board, conductors' primary responsibilities are not ticket examinations&nbsp;\u2013 station fare controls provide coverage. Instead, conductors operate doors and announcement systems, ensure onboard safety, sellonboard tickets, provide customer information and assistance, supervise onboard crews, perform emergency procedures, and troubleshoot equipment where possible. The position's multidisciplinary nature is reflected in Asian terms for \"conductor\"&nbsp;\u2013 {{zh|t=\u5217\u8eca\u9577}} (Mandarin lieh che jhang), {{lang|zh-hant|\u8eca\u9577}} (Cantonese {{zh|labels=no|j=ce<sup>1</sup>zoeng<sup>2</sup>}}), or {{lang-ja|\u8eca\u638c}}; {{transl|ja|shash\u014d}}, still informally used on TRA)&nbsp;\u2013 which translates to \"consist manager\" or \"train handler.\" They have overall responsibility for smooth onboard operations and customer experience, actively directing cleaners, attendants, even [[bento]] vendors.\n\n===Onboard services===\n[[File:Fulong Station Ekiben 02.jpg|thumb|Fulong Station [[ekiben]] by Taiwan Railways Administration.]]\nOn TRA expresses, cleaners periodically move through the train to remove trash, even proactively asking passengers if visible food items are finished. Train attendants offer [[Bento|bento boxes]], drinks, souvenirs, and [[Suncake (Taiwan)|Sun Cakes]] (traditional gifts for visiting friends) from small carts.\n\n==Ticketing==\n[[File:TRA BaDu Station Gate.jpg|thumb|Taiwan Railways Administration faregates and [[Automated fare collection system|Automated Fare Collection (AFC)]] hardware at [[Badu Station]].]]\n[[File:TRA Tze-Chiang Limited Express Taipei-Tainan ticket 20071104.jpg|thumb|Larger format Taiwan Railways Administration ticket used by [[Tze-Chiang Train|Tzu-Chiang]] express train with seat reservations (Car 6 Seat 15), issued by the AFC system.]]\n[[File:TRA Taipei Station Express-only ATVM 20120729.jpg|thumb|Taiwan Railway's second generation ticket vending machine, capable of credit-card processing and reserved-seating ticket issuance seen at Taipei Main Station.]]\n[[File:EasyCard and Taiwan Easy Go reader at TRA Songshan Station 20100608.jpg|thumb|Taiwan Railway's [[Automated fare collection system|smart card]] ticket readers in [[Songshan Station]] for Taipei City's [[EasyCard]] (left) and Taiwan Province's Easy Go (right). The ticket readers were an interim solution before full implementation of integrated ticket gates.]]\n\nTRA's tickets were printed on traditional [[Edmondson railway ticket|Edmondson presses]] until Japan's [[NEC]] supplied a [[Computer reservations system|computerized ticketing and reservation system]] in the late 1980s. Almost all stations are divided into [[Paid area|paid]] (platform) and unpaid (waiting room) areas. Normally, ticket examiners govern platform access, checking and punching tickets as passengers enter. [[Conductor (transportation)|Conductors]] perform onboard ticket checks near peak load points or every ~100 miles, verifying that passengers hold train-class appropriate tickets, and dispense step-up and zone extension fares from portable ticket printers. Examiners also control access to unpaid areas at destinations, ensuring all passengers paid full distance-based fares. Used tickets are collected and not returned to passengers unless cancelled by stamps (similar to postmarks). Those arriving without appropriate tickets (i.e. requiring \"fare adjustments\") are assessed 50% [[Penalty fare|penalties]], giving passengers incentives to find conductors on board to purchase step-up fares. Tickets are validated at origin, destination, and sometimes en route; [[Fare evasion|evasion]] thus would require elaborate two-ticket schemes or exiting from paid area without going through [[fare control]]. Fare evasion rates are thought to be low. [[Proof-of-payment]] methods are not used. \n\n===Fare structure===\nTRA's passenger fares are highly regulated and strictly distance/train-class based (short trips <6.3 miles require 34~73 cents minimum fare.) Express fares are 11.7 cents (per passenger-mile); locals are 5.5 cents.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Taiwan Railways Administration |trans-title=Ticket Policy Information: Fare Computation Principle |script-title=zh:\u8eca\u7968\u8cc7\u8a0a&nbsp;\u2013 \u7968\u50f9\u8a08\u7b97\u539f\u5247 |url=http://service.tra.gov.tw/tw/CP/11333/tickets-1.aspx |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> Within Taipei municipal zone, single trips are 58 cents regardless of distance/class. Unlike HSR, no time- or demand-based off-peak discounts are offered. Periodic (limited-ride) commutation\ntickets and multi-ride carnets are available. Fares are generally competitive with private commuter and\nintercity buses. Express trains operate with higher [[Passenger load factor|load factors]] and are more profitable.\n\n===Fare validation===\nFare validation requires substantial infrastructure (paid/unpaid areas), labour-intensive [[manual fare collection|manual ticket examinations]], and consequent speed-accuracy trade-offs. During the 2000s, TRA incrementally replaced older thermal ticket printers with [[Automated fare collection system|automated fare collection]] (AFC) devices using magnetic-backed stock. Busy stations have faregates to speed up validation. Tickets can be inserted in any orientation. Gates align, check, and mechanically punch tickets prior to opening. Validations are fast and can be \"[[Pipeline (computing)|pipelined]]\" or \"stacked\" (i.e. following passenger can insert ticket while previous passenger is proceeding through the gate). Passenger counting sensors quickly close gates when as many passengers entered as valid tickets processed. When exiting, faregates collect and cancel single trip tickets.\n\nHowever, many locations still use heat-sensitive tickets without ATC, requiring one ticket examiner per fare control. Examiners punch and collect non-magnetic tickets, provide customer information and assistance, troubleshoot AFC malfunctions (e.g. mutilated tickets), and return cancelled (stamped) tickets to passengers requiring proof-of-travel for expense claims. TRA volunteers (with yellow vest) staff some gates. Volunteers, like America's [[auxiliary police]] and volunteer firefighters, include carefully selected and specifically trained members of the public, and retired industry personnel.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tsay |first1=Bai-Ling (\u8521\u767e\u9748) |trans-title=93 Years Old Deng Yo-Tsai, Taiwan Railways\u2019 Oldest Ticket-Punching Volunteer |script-title=zh:93\u6b72\u9127\u6709\u624d&nbsp;\u2013 \u53f0\u9435\u6700\u8001\u526a\u7968\u5fd7\u5de5 |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2010/new/sep/12/today-life12.htm |work=[[Liberty Times]] |location=[[Hualien City|Hualien]] |date=September 12, 2010 |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> They assist passengers, sometimes exercising Japanese or English language skills,<ref>User e88111 from Kaohsiung.

Unreserved single or day-return tickets must be purchased on the day of travel (to prevent ticket reuse), leading to ticket queues at peak commuter periods. Passengers purchasing advance tickets can delay entire queues, causing imminent train departures to be missed. To maximize passenger throughput, separate ticket windows provide train information, today's tickets, and advance or commutation tickets. Some daily ticket windows only accept cash, further decreasing transaction times. Ticket windows at busy stations can be dynamically switched between different functions, minimizing daily ticket queues.\n\n===Fare vending machines===\nEarly machines designed primarily for commuters are essentially receipt printers,\naccepting only coins (no bills) and prepaid magnetic [[Employer transportation benefits in the United States|TransitChek]]-like cards&nbsp;\u2013 not credit cards.\nPassengers must first insert coins (amount deposited is displayed), then press numerous lighted buttons sequentially to specify traveller count, train class, single/return/concessionary, and destination. Buttons light up only when adequate coins are inserted. TVMs sell only unreserved single/round-trips to local destinations (<50 miles) from the current station. Earlier button presses constrain subsequent choices: destinations for which insufficient fares were paid (in selected train class) do not activate and have no effect.\n\nThis machine's target audience is regular travellers who already know required fares. Passenger experiences for first-time customers can be confusing, but once customers learn this TVM, unreserved day ticket transactions are processed much faster than on typical full-feature machines. Machines need only electricity (not network connections) and staff to replace ticket stock, remove coins, and clear jams.\nLike [[Vending machine|soda machines]], they are robust, self-contained, and have been deployed to remote locations.\n\nLong distance TVMs selling advance-purchase, reserved-seating, and prepaid internet/phone tickets were developed later. These more complex machines, functionally similar to Amtrak's [[Amtrak Arrow Reservation System|Quik-Trak]], are available at principal West coast stations.\n\n===Contactless Smartcard fare payment===\nTRTC pioneered transitcards in 2000 via affiliate [http://www.tscc.com.tw Taipei Smart Card Corporation], which performs backoffice functions for TRTC, Taipei's [[Taipei Joint Bus System]] (market-sharing conference) group of bus companies, and other EasyCard merchants. In 2008, TRTC assisted TRA in implementing entry-exit smartcard fare collection<ref>Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation. Annual Report 2008. Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation, Taipei, 2009.</ref> for local travel within Taipei's metropolitan zone (Keelung-[[Zhongli District|Zhongli]]), offering 10% discounts from regular local train fares. Smartcard holders can travel on regular local and\nexpress trains, but not Tarokos, sightseeing specials, nor in business class. When travelling on expresses, smartcard seats are unreserved. As expresses are often sold out, EasyCard offers de facto standee discounts.\n\nOrigin/destination validation and existing fare control areas made smartcard implementation easier.\nInstead of punching tickets to enter and relinquishing tickets to exit, users tap-in and tap-out. Faregates are replaced with newer integrated designs as funding allows. In the interim, ticket collectors visually verify each transaction on low-cost stand-alone terminals, allowing rapid deployment.\n\nSmartcard development in Taiwan is currently fluid. With 13 million cards issued, readers for Mifare\nClassic-based EasyCard are already installed at convenience stores like [[FamilyMart|Family Mart]].\nLegislation authorizing \"Third Generation e-Purse\" (stored value limit ~US$300) was passed in March 2010, allowing smartcard payments for low-value non-transportation items, like Hong Kong's Octopus Card. Three major competitors hold regional subway/bus fare collection franchises (Taipei's \"Youyoka\" [[EasyCard]], Mid-Island's [[:zh:\u81fa\u7063\u901a|Taiwan Easy Go]] \"TaiwanTong\", and Kaohsiung's \"I Pass\"), and TRA has active pilots with both EasyCard and TaiwanTong. Taiwan's MOTC expects to eventually integrate all electronic farecard systems nationwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=EasyCard Plan Steaming Ahead|last=Shan|first=Shelley|date=2008-08-08|work=Taipei Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Rail pass===\n{{Main|TR Pass}}\nBesides single ticket, TRA has also been offering various types of rail pass, with which travelers can ride on trains without buying single tickets. Currently, TRA offers [[TR Pass]] to travelers such that they have unlimited ride on trains within the set period. The pass has two versions - the General Pass and the Student Pass. TRA first offered the Student Pass to foreign students in December 2006 in order to attract more foreign visitors. The offer was extended to local students in 2009. Finally, parallel to the Student Pass, a General Pass, which could be used by everyone, was issued in 2010, so as to replace the ineffective \"Round-the Island Pass\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u74b0\u5cf6\u9031\u904a\u7968}}), which had been offered since 1998.\n\nThe Round-the Island Pass had several restrictions making it unpopular. First, holders of the pass must either travel in the clockwise or anti-clockwise direction without traveling backwards. Secondly, travelers could only pick seven stops to get off and visit. Once a traveler has got off in seven stations, the pass became invalid. These restrictions were deemed too restrictive and limited the use of the pass.<ref name=\"Issuing General Pass\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cardu.com.tw/news/detail.php?nt_pk=27&ns_pk=10123 |script-title=zh:\u53f0\u9435\u65b0\u7248TR PASS\u30003\u65e5\u52385\u65e5\u5238\u958b\u8ce3|website=\u5361\u512a\u65b0\u805e\u7db2|language=Chinese}}</ref> After the issue of TR General Pass in 2010, this pass ceased to be issued.\n\n==Passenger information systems and signage==\n[[File:TRA Dasi Station train timetable 20060630.jpg|thumb|Traditional Taiwan Railway acrylic schedule boards at [[Daxi Station]].]]\nTRA takes a holistic and comprehensive approach towards passenger information. Devices used (in both English and Chinese) range from schedule posters, fixed signage to departure monitors and next-train displays.\n[[File:Houtong Station nearby stations.jpg|thumb|Taiwan Railway's large acrylic backlit signs to indicate station or [[interlocking]] names, and distances to previous and next stations, for use by passengers and crew. Note that this sign was from prior to the switchover from [[tongyong pinyin]] to [[hanyu pinyin]].]]\n\n[[Split-flap display|Solari]]-like \"flippy-flippies\" boards, monitors, or smaller LED displays are provided at major terminals and principal stations. One display per control area shows boarding times and track assignments. Delays as short as one minute are posted. Large acrylic signboards show departure times and fares at smaller stations. Ubiquitous clocks throughout stations and facilities make it difficult to find spots where fewer than two clocks are immediately visible.\n\n===Platform signage, next train identifiers===\nBacklit acrylic signs (airport-style with iconic representations) identify platform and carriage numbers, and provide directions to facilities like restrooms and elevators. Boxes display schedules, tourist information, and service change notices. Large signs (legible from passing trains) indicate station names, and distances to previous/next stations, for use by passengers and crew. Platform LED displays provide next train identity, departure time, delay information, and context-sensitive\nmessages, including public service announcements.\n\n===Onboard displays and announcements===\nTRA's mixed fleet ranges from 1960s hauled stock to new [[Taroko Express|Taroko]]s and commuter MUs. Newer trains feature automated display/announcement systems with high-density [[Dot-matrix display|dot-matrix LEDs]] like Taipei's metro. On long-distance coaches with longer time between station stops, scrolling displays are used. Like in Continental Europe, automated onboard announcements are multilingual.\nAnnouncements are in four major languages ([[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[English language|English]]). In rural areas, announcements are also made in local aboriginal languages; Taitung line has the Pangcah/Amis tribal dialect. In unusual situations, conductors can usually make announcements in at least two languages.\n\nTrains lacking automatic train location features are not simple to retrofit. TRA devised low-cost multi-lingual \"announcement boxes\" connected to the public address system, manually triggered by conductors on approach to stations.\n\n===Exterior train identification===\nIdentifying arriving trains quickly and accurately is equally important to employees and passengers.\nClassically, lighted acrylic destination signboards are manually changed at terminals. Recent modernization efforts provided exterior LED displays showing destination, route, [[Train reporting number|train number]], and class. Newest cars have bilingual flexible displays built-in.

Fares were set at three times the per-mile cost of ordinary local service, as much as NT$117 for certain origin-destination pairs. On February 20 of the same year, the service was initiated between Taipei and Kaohsiung.\n\nThe first ''Chu-kuang Expresses'' in the 1970s used a variety of different vehicles; although the models vary, but the body are universally white with blue line, with one door per side, and in the interior there are carpets and velvet sofa seats. After the completion of the West Coast line electrification project in 1978, all coach bodies were fully painted into orange livery, and service continued to grow.\n\n1986 saw the introduction of rooftop air-conditioning type ''Chu-kuang'' coaches (10200 series), like the previous launch of 35SPK2200 on the ''[[Fu-Hsing Express]]'', the air conditioner is moved to the stainless steel lightweight roof, and each coach was outfitted with a single door per side (manually operated).

A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he is most notable for his long service as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]].\n\nA native of [[Chicago]], Yates graduated from [[Lake View High School (Chicago)|Lake View High School]] in 1928.  He received bachelor's (1931) and law (1933) degrees from the [[University of Chicago]], was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in Chicago.  In addition to working as an attorney, in the 1930s Yates also played semiprofessional basketball.  He gained his initial experience in government as an attorney for the state bank receiver (1935-1937), and an assistant state attorney general specializing in [[Railway electric traction|traction railroads]] for the Illinois Commerce Commission (1937-1940).  During [[World War II]], Yates served in the [[United States Navy]] for two years (1944-1946) as an attorney based in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nIn 1948, Yates was elected to Congress, and he served from 1949 to 1963.  After an unsuccessful run against [[Everett Dirksen]] for the United States Senate in [[1962 United States Senate election in Illinois|1962]], in 1964 Yates was again elected to Congress.  he served from 1965 to 1999, and did not run for reelection in 1998.  He was a longtime member of the House [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], where he became known for staunch U.S. support of [[Israel]], and federal funding for parks, historical conservation, and the arts.  Yates was also an advocate for several liberal causes, including opposition to discrimination based on age.  At the time he concluded his service, he was the oldest person to ever serve in the House (age 89), and one of the longest-tenured members in the history of Congress (total House service of 48 years).\n\nYates died in Washington in 2000.

Yates was an attorney for the Illinois state bank receiver from 1935 to 1937. From 1937 to 1940 he was an assistant state attorney general attached to the Illinois Commerce Commission as a traction attorney. He served in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. He is the longest-serving member ever of the United States House of Representatives from the state of [[Illinois]].\n\n==Career in Congress==\nFrom 1949 to 1963 and 1965 to 1999, Yates served in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] as a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrat]]. Although the boundaries of his district changed over the years, it was always anchored in the Chicago lakefront. From the 1970s onward, Chicago's declining population resulted in the district spilling into the northern suburbs. By the time he retired, his district also included [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]], [[Glenview, Illinois|Glenview]], [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]] and [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]]. \n\nYates was one of the first congressmen to speak out against age discrimination, arguing in 1951 that mandatory retirement of workers was wrong and deprived older people of their ''right to lead a proud, productive and independent life.''\n\nDuring the late 1950s, after a series of lurid magazine articles and Hollywood films helped to sensationalize youth gangs and violence, Yates called for legislation to ban automatic-opening or [[switchblade]] knives, proclaiming that \"Vicious fantasies of omnipotence, idolatry...barbaric and sadistic atrocities, and monstrous violations of accepted values spring from the cult of the weapon, and the switchblade knife is included in this. Minus switchblade knives and the distorted feeling of power they beget\u2014power that is swaggering, reckless, and itching to express itself in violence\u2014our delinquent adolescents would be shorn of one of their most potent means of incitement to crime.\"<ref name=\"LEV\">Levine, Bernard R., ''[http://www.knife-expert.com/schr-pb.txt The Switchblade Menace]'', OKCA Newsletter (1993)</ref><ref>Knife World (August 1990)</ref><ref name=\"CON\">Switchblade Knives: Hearing, House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Eighty-fifth Congress, Minutes of the Second Session, April 17, 1958</ref>  The ban on switchblade knives was eventually enacted into law as the Switchblade Knife Act of 1958.<ref name=\"CON\"/>  Rep.

He briefly served at the [[United Nations]] before returning to the House after the 1964 election.

A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he is most notable for his long service as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]].\n\nA native of [[Chicago]], Yates graduated from [[Lake View High School (Chicago)|Lake View High School]] in 1928.  He received bachelor's (1931) and law (1933) degrees from the [[University of Chicago]], was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in Chicago.  In addition to working as an attorney, in the 1930s Yates also played semiprofessional basketball.  He gained his initial experience in government as an attorney for the state bank receiver (1935-1937), and an assistant state attorney general specializing in [[Railway electric traction|traction railroads]] for the Illinois Commerce Commission (1937-1940).  During [[World War II]], Yates served in the [[United States Navy]] for two years (1944-1946) as an attorney based in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nIn 1948, Yates was elected to Congress, and he served from 1949 to 1963.  After an unsuccessful run against [[Everett Dirksen]] for the United States Senate in [[1962 United States Senate election in Illinois|1962]], in 1964 Yates was again elected to Congress.  he served from 1965 to 1999, and did not run for reelection in 1998.  He was a longtime member of the House [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], where he became known for staunch U.S. support of [[Israel]], and federal funding for parks, historical conservation, and the arts.  Yates was also an advocate for several liberal causes, including opposition to discrimination based on age.  At the time he concluded his service, he was the oldest person to ever serve in the House (age 89), and one of the longest-tenured members in the history of Congress (total House service of 48 years).\n\nYates died in Washington in 2000.  He was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in [[Skokie, Illinois]].\n\n==Early life==\nYates was born in Chicago, Illinois, the youngest of six children of [[Lithuania]]n Jewish immigrants Louis and Ida Yates.<ref>\n{{citation |url= https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XSPL-7D9 |title= United States Census, 1930 |website= [[FamilySearch]] |accessdate=March 24, 2018 }}</ref>  Yates grew up in Chicago and he graduated from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1931 with a [[Bachelor of Philosophy]]<ref>{{cite news |date=June 14, 1931 |title=Degrees Await 63 North Siders at U. of Chicago |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48792893/degrees-await/ |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |location=Chicago, IL |page=Part 7, Page 3 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> and received a [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of Chicago Law School]] in 1933.<ref>{{cite book |last=U.S. Congress |date=1959 |title=Official Congressional Directory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j7pFAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA40 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=US Government Printing Office |page=40 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>  While in college, Yates joined the [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite book |date=1935 |title=The Frater of Pi Lambda Phi |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Frater_Pi_Lambda_Phi_Fraternity/3i3OAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22sidney%20yates%22 |location=Danbury, CT |publisher=Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity |page=26 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>  He also played basketball, and was selected for [[Big Ten Conference|All Big Ten]] honors.<ref>{{cite book |date=1948 |title=The International Teamster |volume=46 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_International_Teamster/WJVZAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22big%20ten%20all-conference%22 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=International Brotherhood of Teamsters |page=97 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>  In the mid-1930s, he played semiprofessional basketball and practiced law. He also worked for Illinois state agencies overseeing railroads and commerce. He served in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]].

Although the boundaries of his district changed over the years, it was always anchored in the Chicago lakefront. From the 1970s onward, Chicago's declining population resulted in the district spilling into the northern suburbs. By the time he retired, his district also included [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]], [[Glenview, Illinois|Glenview]], [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]] and [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]]. \n\nYates was one of the first congressmen to speak out against age discrimination, arguing in 1951 that mandatory retirement of workers was wrong and deprived older people of their ''right to lead a proud, productive and independent life.''\n\nDuring the late 1950s, after a series of lurid magazine articles and Hollywood films helped to sensationalize youth gangs and violence, Yates called for legislation to ban automatic-opening or [[switchblade]] knives, proclaiming that \"Vicious fantasies of omnipotence, idolatry...barbaric and sadistic atrocities, and monstrous violations of accepted values spring from the cult of the weapon, and the switchblade knife is included in this. Minus switchblade knives and the distorted feeling of power they beget\u2014power that is swaggering, reckless, and itching to express itself in violence\u2014our delinquent adolescents would be shorn of one of their most potent means of incitement to crime.\"<ref name=\"LEV\">Levine, Bernard R., ''[http://www.knife-expert.com/schr-pb.txt The Switchblade Menace]'', OKCA Newsletter (1993)</ref><ref>Knife World (August 1990)</ref><ref name=\"CON\">Switchblade Knives: Hearing, House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Eighty-fifth Congress, Minutes of the Second Session, April 17, 1958</ref>  The ban on switchblade knives was eventually enacted into law as the Switchblade Knife Act of 1958.<ref name=\"CON\"/>  Rep.

He briefly served at the [[United Nations]] before returning to the House after the 1964 election.

It was during her time teaching in New Orleans that she began to reflect on some of the ways in which childhood learning at the time was being choked by an overemphasis on strict learning boundaries (e.g., that children could only be allowed to learn how to write in capital letters, not lower-case) and perfunctory memorization.\n\nWhile teaching in Great Neck, she began to reflect on how play can be the \"most usable context\" for interaction and intellectual growth among kindergartners.  This view, however, flew in the face of what many early education teachers thought at the time, that with the rise of television's easily accessible portrayals of violence, children were becoming too intense and restless, and if anything, needed more vigilant limits on playtime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/644871.html | title=A Child's Work: The Importance of Fantasy Play (excerpt)}}</ref>  Many of her insights during this time laid the foundation for her later writings.\n\nAfter receiving her M.A. from [[Hofstra University]] in 1962, she returned to Chicago, where she dedicated the rest of her teaching career.

To collect her data, Paley made audio-recordings of her classrooms so that she could listen to and analyze the interactions that occurred.<ref>Listening to Children\u2019s Stories: An Interview with Vivian Gussin Paley, in Active Learner: A Firefox Journal for Teachers, v3 n1 p12-16, Win 1998</ref> In so doing, she would often hear private conversations between children that would help her think about the unique way young children communicate with other young children.\n\nGenerally, each of her books contains one driving theme.  For example, ''You Can\u2019t Say You Can\u2019t Play'' focuses on the desire of some students to exclude others during classroom playtime.  Paley imposed a rule that children could not exclude other children from play, and discusses the importance of fairness in the classroom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.childcarecollection.com/paley/index.html |title=Child Care Collection: Vivian Paley}}</ref>  In her books ''White Teacher'' and ''Kwanzaa and Me'', Paley explores issues of [[multiculturalism]] within the classroom.

It was during her time teaching in New Orleans that she began to reflect on some of the ways in which childhood learning at the time was being choked by an overemphasis on strict learning boundaries (e.g., that children could only be allowed to learn how to write in capital letters, not lower-case) and perfunctory memorization.\n\nWhile teaching in Great Neck, she began to reflect on how play can be the \"most usable context\" for interaction and intellectual growth among kindergartners.  This view, however, flew in the face of what many early education teachers thought at the time, that with the rise of television's easily accessible portrayals of violence, children were becoming too intense and restless, and if anything, needed more vigilant limits on playtime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/644871.html | title=A Child's Work: The Importance of Fantasy Play (excerpt)}}</ref>  Many of her insights during this time laid the foundation for her later writings.\n\nAfter receiving her M.A. from [[Hofstra University]] in 1962, she returned to Chicago, where she dedicated the rest of her teaching career.

To collect her data, Paley made audio-recordings of her classrooms so that she could listen to and analyze the interactions that occurred.<ref>Listening to Children\u2019s Stories: An Interview with Vivian Gussin Paley, in Active Learner: A Firefox Journal for Teachers, v3 n1 p12-16, Win 1998</ref> In so doing, she would often hear private conversations between children that would help her think about the unique way young children communicate with other young children.\n\nGenerally, each of her books contains one driving theme.  For example, ''You Can\u2019t Say You Can\u2019t Play'' focuses on the desire of some students to exclude others during classroom playtime.  Paley imposed a rule that children could not exclude other children from play, and discusses the importance of fairness in the classroom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.childcarecollection.com/paley/index.html |title=Child Care Collection: Vivian Paley}}</ref>  In her books ''White Teacher'' and ''Kwanzaa and Me'', Paley explores issues of [[multiculturalism]] within the classroom.  In particular, she reflects on her own experiences as a white teacher of children of color and analyzes how she can best support and promote a racially diverse classroom.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/books/are-white-schools-bad-for-black-children.html |author=David K.

Paley argues in these and other works that storytelling and fantasy play can significantly impact a child's academic and social growth.

Ha-has are used in landscape design to prevent access to a garden by, for example, grazing livestock without obstructing views.  In security design, the element is used to deter vehicular access to a site while minimizing visual obstruction.\n\nThe name \"ha-ha\" is thought to have stemmed from the exclamations of surprise by those coming across them, as the walls were intentionally designed so as not to be visible on the plane of the landscape.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/heritage/england/teesside/article_1.shtml|title=What's so funny about a ha-ha wall?|website=[[BBC.co.uk]]|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> Alternatively, it may have been referred to as \"ha-hah\" as an abreviation of \"half and half\" with half a wall and half a ditch.

Ha!]]), and being a feature of the gardens of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Meudon]], circa 1700. The technical innovation was presented in [[Dezallier d'Argenville]]'s ''La th\u00e9orie et la pratique du jardinage'' (1709), which the architect [[John James (architect)|John James]] (1712) translated into English:\n\n<blockquote>Grills of iron are very necessary ornaments in the lines of walks, to extend the view, and to show the country to advantage. At present we frequently make thoroughviews, called Ah, Ah, which are openings in the walls, without grills, to the very level of the walks, with a large and deep ditch at the foot of them, lined on both sides to sustain the earth, and prevent the getting over; which surprises the eye upon coming near it, and makes one laugh, Ha! Ha! from where it takes its name. This sort of opening is haha, on some occasions, to be preferred, for that it does not at all interrupt the prospect, as the bars of a grill do.</blockquote>\n\nThe etymology of the term is generally given as being an expression of surprise\u2014someone says \"ha ha\" or \"ah! ah!\" when they encounter such a feature. This is the explanation given in French, where it is traditionally attributed to [[Louis, Grand Dauphin]], on encountering such features at Meudon, by d'Argenville (trans. James), above, and by Walpole, who surmised that the name is derived from the response of ordinary folk on encountering them and that they were \"... then deemed so astonishing, that the common people called them Ha! Has! to express their surprise at finding a sudden and unperceived check to their walk.\" [[Thomas Jefferson]], describing the garden at [[Stowe House|Stowe]] after his visit in April 1786, also uses the term with exclamation marks: \"The inclosure is entirely by ha! ha!\"<ref>The Papers of Thomas Jefferson Digital Edition, ed.

Ha-has are used in landscape design to prevent access to a garden by, for example, grazing livestock without obstructing views.  In security design, the element is used to deter vehicular access to a site while minimizing visual obstruction.\n\nThe name \"ha-ha\" is thought to have stemmed from the exclamations of surprise by those coming across them, as the walls were intentionally designed so as not to be visible on the plane of the landscape.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/heritage/england/teesside/article_1.shtml|title=What's so funny about a ha-ha wall?|website=[[BBC.co.uk]]|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> Alternatively, it may have been referred to as \"ha-hah\" as an abreviation of \"half and half\" with half a wall and half a ditch.

Ha!]]), and being a feature of the gardens of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Meudon]], circa 1700. The technical innovation was presented in [[Dezallier d'Argenville]]'s ''La th\u00e9orie et la pratique du jardinage'' (1709), which the architect [[John James (architect)|John James]] (1712) translated into English:\n\n<blockquote>Grills of iron are very necessary ornaments in the lines of walks, to extend the view, and to show the country to advantage. At present we frequently make thoroughviews, called Ah, Ah, which are openings in the walls, without grills, to the very level of the walks, with a large and deep ditch at the foot of them, lined on both sides to sustain the earth, and prevent the getting over; which surprises the eye upon coming near it, and makes one laugh, Ha! Ha! from where it takes its name. This sort of opening is haha, on some occasions, to be preferred, for that it does not at all interrupt the prospect, as the bars of a grill do.</blockquote>\n\nThe etymology of the term is generally given as being an expression of surprise\u2014someone says \"ha ha\" or \"ah! ah!\" when they encounter such a feature. This is the explanation given in French, where it is traditionally attributed to [[Louis, Grand Dauphin]], on encountering such features at Meudon, by d'Argenville (trans. James), above, and by Walpole, who surmised that the name is derived from the response of ordinary folk on encountering them and that they were \"... then deemed so astonishing, that the common people called them Ha! Has! to express their surprise at finding a sudden and unperceived check to their walk.\" [[Thomas Jefferson]], describing the garden at [[Stowe House|Stowe]] after his visit in April 1786, also uses the term with exclamation marks: \"The inclosure is entirely by ha! ha!\"<ref>The Papers of Thomas Jefferson Digital Edition, ed.

[[Horace Walpole]] credits Bridgeman with the invention of the ha-ha but was unaware of the earlier French origins.\n\n<blockquote>The contiguous ground of the park without the sunk fence was to be harmonized with the lawn within; and the garden in its turn was to be set free from its prim regularity, that it might assort with the wilder country without.<ref>[http://www.gardenvisit.com/t/w9.htm Horace Walpole, ''Essay upon modern gardening''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220051/http://www.gardenvisit.com/t/w9.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, 1780</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring his excavations at [[Iona]] in the period 1964\u20131984, Richard Reece discovered an 18th-century ha-ha designed to protect the abbey from cattle.<ref name=\"Reece\">Hamlin, Ann (1987).

Accessed Oct. 7, 2006</ref>\n\n==In fiction==\n{{main|Venus in fiction}}Venusians appearing in works of fiction are usually fanciful, rather than plausible inhabitants of the planet. Before the mid 20th century, little was generally known about the planet except that it was solid and comparable in size to Earth; its cloud cover obscured remote observation of its environment. This allowed writers to speculate that Venusians might be similar to humans or other Earth species, much as they did for fictional Martians. As more was learned about Venus and the implausibility of humanoid or other life on it, Venusians became increasingly uncommon in science fiction.\n\n=== In comics and manga ===\n[[File:An Earth Man on Venus 78545.JPG|thumb|right|Cover of 1950 Avon comic adaptation of ''The Radio Man'']]\n* In early [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] stories, Venusians are giant [[frog]]-like amphibians which are ruled over by the evil mad scientist [[Doctor Sivana]] and his family. They are used to the tropical jungles of Venus and find Earth cold, and are quite savage. Venus is inhabited by other savage creatures, some which resemble prehistoric beasts, such as the [[centaur]]-like Gorillalion (which is half-[[gorilla]] half-[[lion]]).\n* The Hydrads of Venus, who resemble huge animated sponges, appear in ''[[Planet Comics]]'', in the Lost World section. If hurt, water can restore them to health. Though opposed to the [[Voltamen]] who have invaded Earth, they are also enemies to [[Hunt Bowman]].\n* In the [[Superman]] story which had the first appearance of the [[Legion of Super-Villains]], one of the members was [[Cosmic King]], a scientist who worked on transmuting elements, but when he was struck by the ray he gained the power to send those beams from his eyes. However, he was exiled from Venus for these experiments.\n* In DC Comics' ''All-Star Comics'' #13 the JSA are gassed by [[Nazi]]s and rocketed to different planets. Wonder Woman is sent to Venus and finds it to be inhabited by fairies led by [[Queen Desira]], who worship [[Aphrodite]], and claim to have been at peace for \"a million years\". She helps them in a war against the Meteor Men, large brutal males.\n* In ''Showcase'' #23, [[Hal Jordan]] [[Green Lantern]] is sent by the Guardians, operating through the power battery to Venus where he meets blue-skinned primitive humanoids who are being attacked by pterosaur-like creatures. He seals the monsters in a cave, and leaves the world, saying the cavemen will one day be a great civilization.\n* In the British comic ''[[Dan Dare]]'' (1950\u20131967), Venus is inhabited by green-skinned [[Treens]] and Therons, who are separated by a fire wall running across Venus. The Mekon, the Super-intelligent Treen leader is a primary villain. Most Treens are emotionless. The Therons are more friendly to Earth.\n* [[Sailor Venus|Minako Aino]] of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' is the reincarnation of the Princess of Venus. The Sailor V Manga shows a diamond shaped structure that is her castle.\n\n===In prose===\n* In the \"[[Venus series]]\" of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], Burroughs created a fictitious 'Venusian' alphabet supposedly used by the Venusians (or \"Amtorians\" - as \"Amtor\" is what the natives call their planet).

The descendants of the invaders, Sixth to Eighth Men, can be considered Venerians themselves.\n* In [[Charles R. Tanner]]'s \"Tumithak of the Corridors\" (1932) and its sequels, Venus is the homeworld of the shelks, [[spider]]-like aliens who have conquered Earth and forced most of the few surviving humans underground.\n* In [[William Lumley]] and [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s \"[[The Diary of Alonzo Typer]]\" (written in 1935 and published in 1938), part of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], there are mentions of the \"Lords of Venus\", and conflicting indications that the [[Serpent Men|Serpent People]] originated there. The story was followed by \"[[In the Walls of Eryx]],\" co-written by Lovecraft and [[Kenneth J. Sterling]], in which a prospector is trapped in a maze on Venus, apparently constructed by [[List of reptilian humanoids|lizardmen]].\n* In [[C. S. Lewis]]' book ''[[Perelandra]]'' (1943), Professor Elwin Ransom travels to Venus (the title is the name of the planet in the Old Solar language), a planet mostly covered by water with floating islands on it, in order to fight a possessed Professor Weston and prevent the \"[[Adam and Eve]]\" of this young planet from bringing about the same fate that befell Earth (Thulcandra).  In the book, Lewis depicts a wide variety of flora and fauna, with some animals close to being sentient. The King and Queen of the planet are humanoid, but green, and their commandment is for them not to sleep on the fixed land, a still island. When this happens, the Oyarsa of this world, a type of angel-like being who seems feminine like the classical goddess, tells Ransom that this will be the start of a new age.\n* ''[[Before Eden]]'', by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], is about a manned expedition to Venus which discovers an animated form of plant life. However, after the humans leave, the creature eats their abandoned garbage and other things left behind and this contamination eventually wipes out all native life on the planet.\n* ''[[The Space Merchants]]'' is a science fiction novel, written by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Cyril M. Kornbluth]] in 1952, about the campaign by [[advertising agency|advertising agencies]] on an overpopulated Earth to convince humans to colonize Venus, which is depicted as having a harsh and stormy [[tropical climate]].\n* \"[[I Am the Doorway]]\", a short story in [[Stephen King]]'s 1971 collection ''[[Night Shift (book)|Night Shift]]'', concerns an astronaut who returns from a tragic mission to Venus to find himself possessed by a murderously terrified alien entity.\n* In [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]'' (1972), [[Willy Wonka]] says that Venus used to be home to an alien race before they were \"gobbled up\" by Vermicious Knids.\n* In [[Jacqueline Susann]]'s romance ''[[Yargo (novel)|Yargo]]'' (1979), Venus is said to be inhabited by bees that are as big as horses.\n* In the [[self-help]] book by [[John Gray (U.S. author)|John Gray]], ''[[Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus]],'' women are occasionally (metaphorically) referred to as Venusians, while men are referred to as [[Martians]].\n* In the book ''[[Venus (novel)|Venus]]'' by [[Ben Bova]], the inhabitants of Venus are strange snake-like creatures that use molten [[sulfur]] for blood. They are not sapient. There are also micro-organisms in the clouds that break down ceramics and metals.\n* In [[Robert A. Heinlein|Heinlein]]'s story \"[[Logic of Empire]]\", the Venusians are an intelligent but primitive race of amphibians who trade valuable swamp roots to the human colonists in return for tobacco. In the novel ''[[Podkayne of Mars]]'' (depicting a fairly different Venus) Venusians are humanoids of great physical strength but also very primitive.\n* The Gobsmacking Galaxy, an entry in the children's non-fiction series ''The Knowledge'' written by Kjartan Poskitt, humorously describes hypothetical alien life forms which might evolve on planets in the solar system; the Venusian creatures are small, squat and round to cope with Venus's atmospheric pressures and make their living selling life insurance to visiting astronauts (before they succumb to the planet's extreme heat and pressure).\n* In Frederik Pohl's \"Gateway\", humans travel across the Galaxy using spaceships found on planet Venus, left there by its ancient civilization.\n\n===In film===\n* The creature in ''[[It Conquered the World]]'' (1956) was from Venus. It resembled a cone with a nasty grin. ''It Conquered the World'' was remade as ''[[Zontar, the Thing from Venus]]'' (1966), whose villain was also an alien from Venus.\n* ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]'' (1957) deals with the crash-landing on [[Sicily]] of a spaceship returning from an expedition to Venus and the resulting rampage by a creature which it brought back. The creature (called in production, but not in the film, a \"[[Ymir]]\") is a reptilian humanoid with perhaps the intelligence of a chimpanzee, which under Terran conditions grows to roughly 20 feet tall.  The film was animated by [[Ray Harryhausen]].\n* ''[[Queen of Outer Space]]'' is a [[science fiction movie]] filmed in 1958 starring [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] as Talleah, the Venusian leader of the resistance to overthrow cruel [[Queen regnant|Queen]] Yllana.\n* In the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'', Jack Nicholson's character speaks of Venusians around a campfire after smoking marijuana.\n* ''[[Venus Wars]]'' is a 1989 science fiction [[anime]] film about life on the planet Venus in the year 2089 after it has been colonized by humans.\n* In the original Japanese version of ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', Princess Selina Salno of the fictional country of Selginia claims to be a survivor of the destruction of Venus by King Ghidorah.\n\n===In television===\n* Venusian visitors sometimes appeared on ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', (including the episodes \"[[Mr. Dingle, the Strong]]\" and \"[[Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?]]\"), as a means of further twisting stories already featuring Martian visitors with similar goals. In \"Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?,\" a Venusian appears disguised as a human [[chef]] with three eyes where the third eye is under his hat.\n* Although never seen or actually discussed in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the [[Third Doctor]] was a master of a martial art known as [[Venusian Aikido]] (or [[Karate]]). Also, the Doctor spoke the words of a Venusian lullaby in \"[[The D\u00e6mons]]\", sang the lullaby (to the tune of \"[[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen]]\") in ''[[The Curse of Peladon]]'', and was shown to carry a toothbrush containing \"Venusian spearmint\" in \"[[The Shakespeare Code]].\" In the spin-off novel ''[[Venusian Lullaby]]'', the Venusians are revealed to be from our Solar System's distant past, before Venus had become the hellish world of today.\n* Venusians work as members of the united galactic organisation in the 1962 television series ''[[Space Patrol (1962 TV series)|Space Patrol]]''.\n* In the first episode of the show ''[[Futurama]]'', [[graffiti]] written in \"Alien Language 1\" is translated \"Go Home Venusians\". In Season 5 Episode 4 a truck shows the words Earth Flag Company in English and then Venusian Corporation in Alien 2.\n* In the second episode of ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', Venus is shown to be inhabited by an advanced civilization called the Fearians. The Fearians are depicted as having three-heads with green skin and red eyes. The Fearian Leader (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) form an alliance with the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]], who trick the Super Friends into changing the world so it can support Fearian life. This will allow the Fearians to form a colony and the Legion will rule the world. The Super Friends are trapped by the Fearian Leader in a force field. However, Green Lantern makes them invisible, causing the Leader to think they have escaped and turn off the field. He is defeated by Black Lightning and Green Lantern sends him back to Venus. The Super Friends then restore the world.\n* In ''[[National Kid]]'', the Inca Venusians are an alien race who National Kid defends the Earth from.\n\n==In ufology==\nIn the 1950s, a group of [[contactees]] told stories in which they claimed to be in contact with friendly, light-haired, light-skinned humans from the planet Venus, as well as other planets in Earth's solar system.<ref name=\"Peebles, pp. 113-119\">(Peebles, pp. 113-119)</ref> The first contactee, and the most famous, was [[George Adamski]] of Palomar Mountain, California. He claimed that on November 20, 1952 he met a Venusian named Orthon in a California desert. Adamski said that Orthon had communicated with him via [[telepathy]] about the dangers of nuclear war and that he left behind footprints with mysterious symbols on them.<ref>(Peebles, pp. 113-115)</ref> Adamski also displayed numerous photographs that he claimed showed the Venusian UFOs, and he said some of the photos had been given to him by Orthon. Copies of these photos were sold to visitors at Adamski's campground and restaurant at Palomar Mountain, but later studies by UFO investigators indicated that the photos were fakes; one scientist who analyzed the photos of a Venusian \"scout ship\" said the UFO's \"landing struts\" were [[General Electric]] light bulbs.<ref name=\"Peebles, pp. 113-119\"/>\n\nAdamski wrote or co-wrote three books in the 1950s and early 1960s about his meetings with Orthon and travels in a Venusian UFO through Earth's solar system; the first two books, ''Flying Saucers Have Landed'' (1953), and ''Inside the Space Ships'' (1955), were both bestsellers.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\">[https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/17346/pg17346.html ''The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects'']. [[Edward J. Ruppelt]]</ref> Following Adamski's story, others, such as [[Howard Menger]], [[George Hunt Williamson]], [[Truman Bethurum]], [[George Van Tassel]], and [[Daniel Fry]], also wrote books and gave lectures in which they claimed to have met similar friendly, light-skinned humanoids from Venus and other planets in Earth's solar system, and to have taken trips with them in their spaceships. These humanoids were later called [[Nordic aliens]].<ref>{{cite web| last =Lewis| first =Judith| title =Get a Piece of the Rock| publisher =[[LA Weekly]]| date =April 5, 2000| url =http://www.laweekly.com/general/travel/get-a-piece-of-the-rock/11493/| accessdate =2007-05-05}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, the contactee movement garnered some popular interest through books, lectures, and conventions, such as the annual Giant Rock UFO conventions in California. In May 1959, Adamski had a private audience with Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands]] to discuss his claimed UFO experiences, which caused some controversy in the Netherlands.<ref>\nhttps://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PYNWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6uQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1129,3236964&dq=1959+george-adamski&hl=en</ref>\n\nHowever, numerous investigations of the contactee movement revealed many flaws and inaccuracies in the contactees' claims that led most researchers to conclude that their stories were hoaxes.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/> Among the pieces of evidence noted by critics was that Venus has an environment that is extremely hostile to human life, and that none of the other planets in Earth's solar system are capable of supporting humanoid life. Also, investigators such as USAF Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]], the head of the Air Force's [[Project Blue Book]], and ufologist [[James W. Moseley]] conducted extensive investigations into the claims and backgrounds of Adamski, Williamson, and other contactees, and concluded that they were either con artists or simply not being truthful in their stories and claims.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/><ref>(Peebles, pp. 118-`20)</ref>\n\n==In religion==\n* In the teachings of the [[UFO religion]] the [[Unarius Academy of Science]], the capital of Venus, which, like the Venusians themselves, is said to exist on a ''[[Etheric plane|higher vibratory plane]]'', is called ''Azure''.<ref>Norman, Ernst and Ruth ''The Voice of Venus'' 1954 Unarius Academy of Science</ref>\n* [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] [[guru]] [[Benjamin Creme]] subscribes to the Theosophical view that the [[Nordic aliens]] (like those seen by George Adamski\u2014Creme accepts Adamski's UFO sightings as valid) pilot flying saucers from a civilization on Venus that exists on the [[etheric plane]] (Theosophists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the ''etheric plane'', the heat does not affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the [[physical plane]].<ref>Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 205</ref> It is also believed in Theosophy that the governing [[deity]] of Earth, [[Sanat Kumara]] [http://www.sirius1-bg.net/sirius/images/sanat_kumara.jpg],<ref>[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm Image of Sanat Kumara from Luis Prada\u2019s \"Brother Veritus'\" Ascended Master Teachings website:]</ref> is a Nordic alien originally from Venus.<ref>Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 117</ref> Sanat Kumara is said to live in a [[palace]] in a [[Mythological place|mythical city]] on the etheric plane of Earth called [[Shambhala|Shamballa]], which is said by Theosophists to be located above the [[Gobi Desert]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cytherean]]\n* [[Jovian (fiction)]]\n* [[Martian]]\n* [[Venus in fiction]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.solarviews.com/raw/venus/topol.gif NASA Map of Venus:]\n\n{{Astronomical locations in fiction}}\n{{UFOs}}\n{{Venus}}\n\n[[Category:Alleged UFO-related entities]]\n[[Category:Venus]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Venetian (disambiguation){{!}}Venetians}}\n{{Infobox mythical creature\n|name  = Venusian\n|image     = Venus-real color.jpg\n|caption  = Planet Venus\n|Grouping       = [[Extraterrestrial life|Extraterrestrial]]\n|Sub_Grouping   =\n|AKA            =\n|Country        =\n|Region         =\n|Habitat        = [[Venus]]\n|First_Reported =\n|Last_Sighted   =\n|Status         = Unconfirmed\n}}\nIn [[science fiction]] and [[ufology]], a '''Venusian''' ({{IPAc-en|v|\u1d7b|\u02c8|nj|u\u02d0|\u0292|\u0259n|,_|-|\u0283|\u0259n}}) or '''Venerian''' is a native inhabitant of the [[planet]] [[Venus]].

''It Conquered the World'' was remade as ''[[Zontar, the Thing from Venus]]'' (1966), whose villain was also an alien from Venus.\n* ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]'' (1957) deals with the crash-landing on [[Sicily]] of a spaceship returning from an expedition to Venus and the resulting rampage by a creature which it brought back. The creature (called in production, but not in the film, a \"[[Ymir]]\") is a reptilian humanoid with perhaps the intelligence of a chimpanzee, which under Terran conditions grows to roughly 20 feet tall.  The film was animated by [[Ray Harryhausen]].\n* ''[[Queen of Outer Space]]'' is a [[science fiction movie]] filmed in 1958 starring [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] as Talleah, the Venusian leader of the resistance to overthrow cruel [[Queen regnant|Queen]] Yllana.\n* In the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'', Jack Nicholson's character speaks of Venusians around a campfire after smoking marijuana.\n* ''[[Venus Wars]]'' is a 1989 science fiction [[anime]] film about life on the planet Venus in the year 2089 after it has been colonized by humans.\n* In the original Japanese version of ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', Princess Selina Salno of the fictional country of Selginia claims to be a survivor of the destruction of Venus by King Ghidorah.\n\n===In television===\n* Venusian visitors sometimes appeared on ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', (including the episodes \"[[Mr. Dingle, the Strong]]\" and \"[[Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?]]\"), as a means of further twisting stories already featuring Martian visitors with similar goals. In \"Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?,\" a Venusian appears disguised as a human [[chef]] with three eyes where the third eye is under his hat.\n* Although never seen or actually discussed in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the [[Third Doctor]] was a master of a martial art known as [[Venusian Aikido]] (or [[Karate]]). Also, the Doctor spoke the words of a Venusian lullaby in \"[[The D\u00e6mons]]\", sang the lullaby (to the tune of \"[[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen]]\") in ''[[The Curse of Peladon]]'', and was shown to carry a toothbrush containing \"Venusian spearmint\" in \"[[The Shakespeare Code]].\" In the spin-off novel ''[[Venusian Lullaby]]'', the Venusians are revealed to be from our Solar System's distant past, before Venus had become the hellish world of today.\n* Venusians work as members of the united galactic organisation in the 1962 television series ''[[Space Patrol (1962 TV series)|Space Patrol]]''.\n* In the first episode of the show ''[[Futurama]]'', [[graffiti]] written in \"Alien Language 1\" is translated \"Go Home Venusians\". In Season 5 Episode 4 a truck shows the words Earth Flag Company in English and then Venusian Corporation in Alien 2.\n* In the second episode of ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', Venus is shown to be inhabited by an advanced civilization called the Fearians. The Fearians are depicted as having three-heads with green skin and red eyes. The Fearian Leader (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) form an alliance with the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]], who trick the Super Friends into changing the world so it can support Fearian life. This will allow the Fearians to form a colony and the Legion will rule the world. The Super Friends are trapped by the Fearian Leader in a force field. However, Green Lantern makes them invisible, causing the Leader to think they have escaped and turn off the field. He is defeated by Black Lightning and Green Lantern sends him back to Venus. The Super Friends then restore the world.\n* In ''[[National Kid]]'', the Inca Venusians are an alien race who National Kid defends the Earth from.\n\n==In ufology==\nIn the 1950s, a group of [[contactees]] told stories in which they claimed to be in contact with friendly, light-haired, light-skinned humans from the planet Venus, as well as other planets in Earth's solar system.<ref name=\"Peebles, pp. 113-119\">(Peebles, pp. 113-119)</ref> The first contactee, and the most famous, was [[George Adamski]] of Palomar Mountain, California. He claimed that on November 20, 1952 he met a Venusian named Orthon in a California desert. Adamski said that Orthon had communicated with him via [[telepathy]] about the dangers of nuclear war and that he left behind footprints with mysterious symbols on them.<ref>(Peebles, pp. 113-115)</ref> Adamski also displayed numerous photographs that he claimed showed the Venusian UFOs, and he said some of the photos had been given to him by Orthon. Copies of these photos were sold to visitors at Adamski's campground and restaurant at Palomar Mountain, but later studies by UFO investigators indicated that the photos were fakes; one scientist who analyzed the photos of a Venusian \"scout ship\" said the UFO's \"landing struts\" were [[General Electric]] light bulbs.<ref name=\"Peebles, pp. 113-119\"/>\n\nAdamski wrote or co-wrote three books in the 1950s and early 1960s about his meetings with Orthon and travels in a Venusian UFO through Earth's solar system; the first two books, ''Flying Saucers Have Landed'' (1953), and ''Inside the Space Ships'' (1955), were both bestsellers.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\">[https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/17346/pg17346.html ''The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects'']. [[Edward J. Ruppelt]]</ref> Following Adamski's story, others, such as [[Howard Menger]], [[George Hunt Williamson]], [[Truman Bethurum]], [[George Van Tassel]], and [[Daniel Fry]], also wrote books and gave lectures in which they claimed to have met similar friendly, light-skinned humanoids from Venus and other planets in Earth's solar system, and to have taken trips with them in their spaceships. These humanoids were later called [[Nordic aliens]].<ref>{{cite web| last =Lewis| first =Judith| title =Get a Piece of the Rock| publisher =[[LA Weekly]]| date =April 5, 2000| url =http://www.laweekly.com/general/travel/get-a-piece-of-the-rock/11493/| accessdate =2007-05-05}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, the contactee movement garnered some popular interest through books, lectures, and conventions, such as the annual Giant Rock UFO conventions in California. In May 1959, Adamski had a private audience with Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands]] to discuss his claimed UFO experiences, which caused some controversy in the Netherlands.<ref>\nhttps://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PYNWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6uQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1129,3236964&dq=1959+george-adamski&hl=en</ref>\n\nHowever, numerous investigations of the contactee movement revealed many flaws and inaccuracies in the contactees' claims that led most researchers to conclude that their stories were hoaxes.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/> Among the pieces of evidence noted by critics was that Venus has an environment that is extremely hostile to human life, and that none of the other planets in Earth's solar system are capable of supporting humanoid life. Also, investigators such as USAF Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]], the head of the Air Force's [[Project Blue Book]], and ufologist [[James W. Moseley]] conducted extensive investigations into the claims and backgrounds of Adamski, Williamson, and other contactees, and concluded that they were either con artists or simply not being truthful in their stories and claims.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/><ref>(Peebles, pp. 118-`20)</ref>\n\n==In religion==\n* In the teachings of the [[UFO religion]] the [[Unarius Academy of Science]], the capital of Venus, which, like the Venusians themselves, is said to exist on a ''[[Etheric plane|higher vibratory plane]]'', is called ''Azure''.<ref>Norman, Ernst and Ruth ''The Voice of Venus'' 1954 Unarius Academy of Science</ref>\n* [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] [[guru]] [[Benjamin Creme]] subscribes to the Theosophical view that the [[Nordic aliens]] (like those seen by George Adamski\u2014Creme accepts Adamski's UFO sightings as valid) pilot flying saucers from a civilization on Venus that exists on the [[etheric plane]] (Theosophists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the ''etheric plane'', the heat does not affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the [[physical plane]].<ref>Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 205</ref> It is also believed in Theosophy that the governing [[deity]] of Earth, [[Sanat Kumara]] [http://www.sirius1-bg.net/sirius/images/sanat_kumara.jpg],<ref>[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm Image of Sanat Kumara from Luis Prada\u2019s \"Brother Veritus'\" Ascended Master Teachings website:]</ref> is a Nordic alien originally from Venus.<ref>Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 117</ref> Sanat Kumara is said to live in a [[palace]] in a [[Mythological place|mythical city]] on the etheric plane of Earth called [[Shambhala|Shamballa]], which is said by Theosophists to be located above the [[Gobi Desert]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cytherean]]\n* [[Jovian (fiction)]]\n* [[Martian]]\n* [[Venus in fiction]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.solarviews.com/raw/venus/topol.gif NASA Map of Venus:]\n\n{{Astronomical locations in fiction}}\n{{UFOs}}\n{{Venus}}\n\n[[Category:Alleged UFO-related entities]]\n[[Category:Venus]]\n", "name_user": "42.61.229.50", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venusians"}
