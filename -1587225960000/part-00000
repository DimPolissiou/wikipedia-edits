They all study in Lawrence College in Murree. Saad's family comprises his father, Brigadier (later Major General) Faraz Inam, who serves in the army, his mother and sister, Rahmeen, an aspiring artist. Shahzain belongs to a rich village family and is the closest to his grandfather, Malik Allahyar. Shariq's family consists of his sister, Ghazala and his widowed mother. Shehryar's father is a bandmaster. They often bunk college together at night and once caught by their hostel warden, Firdous Baig.\n\nOn the other hand, there is Dua and Rani. Rani is a vivacious girl, who comes from a rich village family. After three years, she is yet to pass her Intermediate exams, which she ultimately doesn't. Dua comes from Rawalpindi and is seen visiting her cousins, Aisha and Raheel in Murree. Raheel is obnoxious and is over-protective of Dua, which she immensely dislikes and tries to avoid him.\n\nDespite receiving warnings from the headmaster of the college, the SSG still bunk college and this time, they accidentally run into Dua and her cousins. Saad immediately recognizes Dua, while Shariq and Shehryar run away from the scene. Saad tells Shahzain that he had seen Dua twice before and has a crush on her but he didn't have the courage to tell her about his feelings. Shahzain encourages Saad to go after her and get to know her name since he didn't.\n\nThe next day, they met Dua again after Shariq spots her with her cousins and tells the other three, who immediately rushes to her. As Shahzain and Shehryar begin to introduce themselves to Dua and tell her about Saad, Raheel pushes Saad, thinking he was harassing Dua and a physical fight follows. The police arrive and take Saad and Raheel into custody, while Shahzain and Shehryar flee, later joined by Shariq.\n\nDua's parents file a complaint against Saad, in the name of harassment. This causes a rift between the SSG. Shariq refuses to be involved in their tactics anymore. Saad slaps Shahzain, because he made a fuss in front of Dua. In the end, Saad, Shahzain and Shehryar were rusticated from the hostel. Since Sharq wasn't directly involved in the incident, no action was taken against him.\n\nThe four friends now go on to lead their separate lives. Shahzain doesn't show up for his exams and slowly transforms into an angry young man. Saad is confused between choosing Army or Medical as his profession but ultimately joins army after finding Dua submitting her application at the same medical college where he went. Later they meet at a park by accident. Dua softens up when she overhears him scolding his pet Zoro for running after her.\n\nShahzain and Shehryar then visit Saad, wanting to reconcile but Saad humiliates the two and ask them to leave. Saad later departs for PMA (Pakistan Military Academy). Upon arriving at PMA, Saad meets Gulzar Hussain and develops a good friendship with him. \n\nOn the other hand, Shahzain marries Rani. Shahzain only invites Shariq and Shehryar for his wedding. When he hears the two talking about Saad, it angers him. Shariq and Shrehyar leave realizing that Shahzain only viewed them as commodities and not friends. \n\nIn their next meeting Saad and Dua were confronted by Raheel (Dua's cousin). Dua walks off angrily and goes home. Raheel proposes to Dua for marriage but Dua refuses and tells her father to trust her that Saad is just a friend. She then tells Saad she won't contact him until they both establish their careers. Raheel's parents then invite Dua's parents and insist on their marriage but Dua's father refuses. On the way home, Dua's parents have a road accident. Dua's father passes away and her mother becomes disabled. Her cousin blackmails her into marrying him as he finds out she is adopted. Dua agrees but then expose him in front of his parents. Dua and her mother shift to Abbottabad to live near her medical college. Saad is shown to pass out of PMA with a sword of honour. Later he finds about Dua's father. \n\nShahzain is shown to be contesting in the by elections. Shariq's [[YouTube]] channel has been so well established that he is offered a job as a news anchor at a well-established channel. He accepts the job after declining at first and selects Ramsha (a former news reporter who became friends with Shariq) as producer of his show.\n\nShahzain wins his elections and becomes an MNA. Shariq achieves success as a news anchor. After passing out from PMA, Saad starts his army duties and visits Dua. He helps Dua in setting up her new home. They grow closer to each other and eventually meet each other's parents. Saad starts planning his wedding and bumps into Shahzain while completing a wedding-related task. They hug each other and reconcile. \n\nMeanwhile, Shehryar is appointed as an Assistant Commissioner and works with Shariq to help free one of their college friends who has been wrongly imprisoned due to a mafia gang. Shariq and Shehryar manage to successfully free him. All the four friends get together for Saad's wedding and are seen teasing Saad. On the night of the wedding, it is revealed that Dua has been appointed as an army doctor and walks down the aisle in her uniform leaving Saad in awe.\n\n==Series Overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\" rowspan=\"2\" | No. of episodes\n! colspan=\"2\" | Originally broadcast <small>([[Pakistan]])</small>\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\" | First episode\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\" | Last episode\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f00;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 25\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{start date|df=yes|2019|9|22}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{end date|df==yes|2020|3|15}}\n\n|-\n\n|}\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Osman Khalid Butt.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Osman Khalid Butt]]\n[[File:Ahmed Ali Akbar at an event in Islamabad.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Ahmed Ali Akbar]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

For two years, the island was part of an [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]]. However, relations between British and Corsicans soured. Spain declared war against Britain in 1796, putting all British territories in the Mediterranean at risk and prompting the British to withdraw from Corsica. Several pro-Paoli Corsicans fled the island or were exiled, and in September 1798, they formed a light infantry company known as the \"Franc Tireur Corses\" on [[Menorca]], which at the time was held by the British. The unit consisted of seven officers and 226 other ranks.\n\nIn July 1800, Captain [[Hudson Lowe]] of the [[50th (Queen's Own) Regiment of Foot|50th Foot]] was detached to command the unit, with the temporary rank of Major. Lowe had served on Corsica during the brief period of British control, and spoke both French and Italian. The unit was transported to [[Gibraltar]], where they impressed General [[Ralph Abercromby]], who was preparing an expedition to remove the French from [[Egypt]], which they had conquered in 1798. Abercromby issued them with new uniforms and [[Baker rifle]]s, and placed them in his Reserve Division. They took part in the opposed landing at the [[Battle of Abukir (1801)|Battle of Aboukir]] after which they were re-titled the '''Corsican Rangers'''.\n\nThe unit took part in the subsequent actions in Egypt. They received praise, and were entitled to wear buttons and other equipment decorated with a sphinx. The [[Peace of Amiens]] was signed between Britain and France shortly after the French evacuated Egypt. The Corsican Rangers were disbanded in [[Malta]].\n\n==Second embodiment==\nWhen war broke out again between Britain and France in 1803, Major Lowe was ordered to raise a second Corsican regiment, to serve in the Mediterranean. Most of the officers Lowe nominated were Corsican, as was the hard core of 360 riflemen, organised in six companies.  They were augmented by recruits from [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]] and [[Naples]], to a strength of roughly 600 in ten companies. The regiment was officially accepted into the British Army in October 1804.\n\nIn July 1805, the Royal Corsican Rangers took part in a British expedition to Sicily and Naples. On 4 July 1806, three companies of the regiment took part in the [[Battle of Maida]], which ended with a British victory.\n\nFrom the end of 1806 to 1808, the Rangers were stationed on Capri, where Hudson Lowe was appointed commander of the garrison. In 1808, French and Neapolitan forces under [[Joachim Murat]], the King of Naples imposed by the French, attacked the island and conquered it after a severe fight. Some of the Rangers deserted rather than fight Corsicans in French service, but others distinguished themselves. Lowe was forced to capitulate, but his forces were allowed to depart with full military honours.\n\nThe next year, the regiment took part in an expedition to the [[Ionian Islands]] under General Sir [[John Stuart, Count of Maida|John Stuart]]. By this time, the regiment was commanded by its former second in command, Lieutenant Colonel John McCombe. On 30 September, 600 troops from the regiment, led by Colonel Lowe (who was appointed second in command to Major General [[John Oswald (British Army officer)|John Oswald]], the commander of the division), captured [[Zakynthos]] from its outnumbered French garrison without fighting. Detachments participated in the capture of other islands of [[Kefalonia]], [[Ithaca]] and [[Kythira]].\n\nOn 16 October 1813, a conjunct force consisting of {{HMS|Bacchante|1811|6}}, {{HMS|Saracen|1812|6}}, and Captain Piearce Lowen of \"His Majesty's Corsican Rangers\", captured \"Forts Espagnole and Castel Nuova\", near [[Kotor|Cattaro]].

During his decades-long career, Mexican filmmaker [[Guillermo del Toro]] has worked on a number of projects that never progressed beyond the pre-production stage. Some of these projects fell into [[development hell]] and are presumably canceled.\n\n==1990s==\n\n=== ''Meat Market: A Love Story'' ===\n''Meat Market'', an original screenplay by del Toro, which he described as \"''[[Hamlet]]'' in a meet market, by the way of ''[[Phantom of the Opera]]''\". Del Toro wanted [[Ron Perlman]] to star in the lead role, but lost interest in pursuing the project when he believed Perlman had become to old to play the part.<ref>Guillermo del Toro and Marc Zicree, 2013, \"Guillermo del Toro Cabinet of Curiosities: My Notebooks, Collections, and Other Obsessions\", Harper Design</ref>\n\n===''The Left Hand of Darkness''===\nIn 1994, del Toro began writing an adaptation of [[Alexandre Dumas]]'s ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', which he titled ''The Left Hand of Darkness''.

He has to become the beast of the Apocalypse to be able to defend humanity, but at the same time, he becomes a much darker being. It's a very interesting ending to the series, but I don't think it will happen. ... We have gone through basically every studio and asked for financing, and they are not interested. I think that the first movie made its budget back, and a little bit of profit, but then it was very very big on video and DVD. The story repeated itself with the second already, it made its money back at the box office, but a small margin of profit in the release of the theatrical print, but was very very big on DVD and video.

Moving into the new B.P.R.D. headquarters in Colorado, Abe is troubled by his psychic connection with Princess Nuala, and begins researching the elves' history. The film would have shown Nuada's adventures throughout history, including his rivalry with a fairy courtier who orchestrates Nuada's exile in hopes of marrying Nuala and seizing control of the fairy kingdom; Nuada first meeting Mister Wink by saving him from a troupe of soldiers during the [[Spanish Inquisition]]; and Nuada in [[Nazi Germany]], engineering a pact to keep various supernatural entities safe during [[World War II]] (with Nuada and Kroenen fighting in a \"friendly\" match for Project Ragnarok men.) Doug Jones would have played both Abe and the Angel of Death, who strikes a bargain with Nuada. [[Rupert Evans]]'s Agent Myers would also have returned.

Moving into the new B.P.R.D. headquarters in Colorado, Abe is troubled by his psychic connection with Princess Nuala, and begins researching the elves' history.

Doug Jones would have played both Abe and the Angel of Death, who strikes a bargain with Nuada. [[Rupert Evans]]'s Agent Myers would also have returned.
