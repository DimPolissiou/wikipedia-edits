/><ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" />  Pre-Neoarchean (4.6\u20132.8 billion years ago) rocks are just a small portion of the basement rocks, but [[zircon]] as old as 4.1 billion years old was found in the craton.<ref name=\"Late Archean to Paleoproterozoic evolution\" /><ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" />  He suggested that the Neoarchean (2.8\u20132.5 billion years ago) crust of the North China Craton, which accounts for 85% of the Permian basement, was formed in two distinct periods. First is from 2.8 to 2.7 billion years ago, and later from 2.6 to 2.5 billion years ago, based on zircon age data.<ref name=\"Late Archean to Paleoproterozoic evolution\" /><ref name=\"Precambrian

/><ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" />  Neoarchean (2.8\u20132.5 Ma) mantle upwelled and heated up the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]] and lower crust, resulting in metamorphism.<ref name=\"Archean blocks and their boundaries\" />\n\nIn the [[Paleoproterozoic]] time (2.5\u20131.6 billion years ago), the North China Craton amalgamated in three steps, with the

[[Khondalite|Khondalite Belt]] 1.95 billion years ago.<ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" /><ref name=\"Archean blocks and their boundaries\" />  For the Eastern Block, there was a rifting event in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, which separated the Longgang Block and the Langrim Block with an ocean before the block was formed 2.1 to 1.9 billion years ago.<ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" /><ref name=\"Archean blocks and their boundaries\" />  A rifting system is proposed because of how the rocks were metamorphosed in the belt and symmetrical rocks have been found on both side of the Belt.<ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" /><ref name=\"Archean blocks and their boundaries\" />  Around 1.9 billion years ago, the rift system at the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt switched to a subductional and collisional system.<ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" /><ref name=\"Archean blocks and their boundaries\" />  The Longgang Block and the Langrim Block then combined, forming the Eastern Block.<ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" /><ref name=\"Archean blocks and their boundaries\" />  1.85 billion years ago, the Trans North China Orogen was formed by the collision of the Eastern and Western Blocks in an eastward subduction system, with probably an ocean between the 2 blocks

Kusky argued that the 1.8 billion years ago metamorphic events found by Zhao to prove the amalgamation event is just the overprint of the collision event with the Columbia Supercontinent 1.85 billion years ago.<ref name=\"Geophysical and geological tests of tectonic models\" />  The collision event with the Columbia Supercontinent also replaced lithosphere with new mantle, which would affect the dating.<ref name=\"Geophysical and geological tests of tectonic models\" />  Another argument is that the metamorphic rocks found 1.8 billion years ago is not confined to the Central Orogenic Belt (or Trans-North China Orogenic Belt).<ref name=\"Geophysical and geological tests of tectonic models\" />  They are also found in the Western Block, indicating that the metamorphic events was a craton-wide event.<ref name=\"Geophysical and geological tests of tectonic models\" /> Zhao, on the opposite, argued that based on the lithological evidences, for example, the Eastern and Western Blocks must have been formed in settings different from the central part 2.6 to 2.5 billion years ago.<ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Guochun|last2=Cawood|first2=Peter A.|last3=Li|first3=Sanzhong|last4=Wilde|first4=Simon A.|last5=Sun|first5=Min|last6=Zhang|first6=Jian|last7=He|first7=Yanhong|last8=Yin|first8=Changqing|date=2012|title=Amalgamation of the North China Craton: Key issues and discussion|journal=Precambrian Research|volume=222\u2013223|pages=55\u201376|doi=10.1016/j.precamres.2012.09.016|bibcode=2012PreR..222...55Z|url=http://www.gt-crust.ru/jour/article/view/434}}</ref>  Therefore, they would have been separated at that time.<ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" /><ref name=\":0\" />  The pluton upwelling may explain the metamorphic event 2.5 billion years ago.<ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" /><ref name=\":0\" />  Zhao also argued that Kusky has not provided sufficient isotopic evidence regarding the metamorphic data.<ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" /><ref name=\":0\" />  In contrast with Kusky's argument that deformation events should follow tight with each other rather than staying still for 700 million years, Zhao argued that there are a lot of orogens in the world that have stayed still for a long period of time without any deformation events.<ref name=\"Precambrian basement in the North China Craton\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Other Models (Zhai's 7 Blocks Model, Faure and Trap 3 Blocks Model, Santosh Double Subduction Model) ====\n[[File:Zhai and Santosh model.png|thumb|340x340px|\nThis map view diagram shows how Zhao proposed the micro blocks would have been oriented and amalgamated into North China Craton.
