However, Ichimoku is also integrated by three other theories that improve and enhance the indicator:\n\n* Time Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Time Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/ichimoku-time-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n* Wave Movement Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Wave Movement Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/part-3-ichimoku-wave-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n* Target Price Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Price Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/part-4-target-price-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n\n==Key Elements of Ichimoku's Graphic Environment==\n\n===Tenkan-sen===\nTenkan-sen ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u8ee2\u63db|\u8ee2\u63db]][[:wikt:\u7dda|\u7dda]]}}) calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for the last 9 periods.\n\nIt is primarily used as a signal line and a minor support/resistance line. Tenkan Sen (red line): This is also known as the turning line and is derived by averaging the highest high and the lowest low for the past nine periods. ''The Tenkan Sen is an indicator of the market trend. If the red line is moving up or down, it indicates that the market is trending. If it moves horizontally, it signals that the market is ranging''.\n\n===Kijun-sen===\nKijun-sen ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u57fa\u6e96|\u57fa\u6e96]]\u7dda}}) calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for the past 26 periods.\n\nThis is a confirmation line, a support/resistance line, and can be used as a trailing stop line. The Kijun Sen acts as an indicator of future price movement. If the price is higher than the blue line, it could continue to climb higher. If the price is below the blue line, it could keep dropping.\n\n===Senkou span A===\nSenkou ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u5148\u884c|\u5148\u884c]]}}) span A calculation: (Tenkan-sen + kijun-sen)/2 plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 1, this line forms one edge of the kumo or cloud.\n\nIf the price is above the Senkou span, the top line serves as the first support level while the bottom line serves as the second support level.\n\nIf the price is below the Senkou span, the bottom line forms the first resistance level while the top line is the second resistance level.\n\n===Senkou span B===\nSenkou span B calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 calculated over the past 52 time periods and plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 2, this line forms the other edge of the Kumo.\n\n===Kumo===\nKumo ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u96f2|\u96f2]]}}, cloud) is the space between Senkou span A and B. The cloud edges identify current and potential future support and resistance points.\n\nThe Kumo cloud changes in shape and height based on price changes. This height represents volatility as larger price movements form thicker clouds, which creates stronger support and resistance. As thinner clouds offer only weak support and resistance, prices can and tend to break through such thin clouds.\n\nGenerally, markets are bullish when Senkou Span A is above Senkou Span B and vice versa when markets are bearish. Traders often look for Kumo Twists in future clouds, where Senkou Span A and B exchange positions, a signal of potential trend reversals.\n\nIn addition to thickness, the strength of the cloud can also be ascertained by its angle; upwards for bullish and downwards for bearish. Any clouds behind price are also known as Kumo Shadows.\n\n===Chikou span===\nChikou ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u9045\u884c|\u9045\u884c]]}}) span calculation: today's closing price projected back 26 days on the chart.\n\nAlso called the lagging span it is used as a support/resistance aid.\n\nIf the Chikou Span or the green line crosses the price in the bottom-up direction, that is a buy signal. If the green line crosses the price from the top-down, that is a sell signal.\n\n== Key Elements of Ichimoku's Time Theory ==\n\nGoichi Hosoda also developed the time theory by differentiating 3-time ranges and two different levels: simple and compound.\n\n===Numerical values===\n\nSimple ranges\n[[File:= SIMPLE ranges.png|thumb|Simple ranges at Ichimoku]]\n\nCompound ranges\n[[File:= COMPOUND RANGES.png|thumb|Compound ranges at Ichimoku]]\n\n===Equality in the numerical values or Taitou-Suchi===\n\nHen-Gi: Using a numerical value that happened before and applying it from another\n\nJyu-Gi: Proposing a numerical value that happened before and applying it from a point between the time range\n\n== The key elements of Ichimoku wave movement theory ==\n\nHosoda knew about [[Elliott wave principle]] but his renderings about it were not as complex as Elliott\u2019s.

In 1992, Inslee was elected to represent {{ushr|WA|4}}, based around [[Central Washington]], in the U.S. House of Representatives. Defeated for reelection in [[1994 United States House of Representatives elections|1994]], Inslee briefly returned to private legal practice. He made his first run for governor of Washington in [[1996 Washington gubernatorial election|1996]], coming in fifth in the [[blanket primary]] ahead of the general election, which was won by Democrat [[Gary Locke]]. Inslee then served as regional director for the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] under President [[Bill Clinton]].\n\nInslee returned to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1999, this time for {{ushr|WA|1|}}. The new district included Seattle's northern suburbs in [[King County, Washington|King County]], [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish County]], and [[Kitsap County, Washington|Kitsap County]]. He was reelected six times before announcing that he would make another run for the governorship in the [[2012 Washington gubernatorial election|2012 election]]. He resigned from Congress to focus on his campaign. He defeated Republican [[Rob McKenna]], the [[List of Attorneys General of Washington|Attorney General of Washington]].

He has garnered national attention for his critiques of President [[Donald Trump]]. Inslee, State Attorney General [[Bob Ferguson (politician)|Bob Ferguson]] and State Solicitor General [[Noah Purcell]] sued the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]] over [[Executive Order 13769]], which halted travel for 90 days from seven Muslim-majority countries and imposed a total ban on Syrian refugees entering the United States. The case, ''[[Washington v. Trump]]'', led to the order being blocked by the courts, and other executive orders later superseded it.\n\nInslee [[Jay Inslee 2020 presidential campaign|was a candidate]] for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic nomination]] for President of the United States in the 2020 election, launching his campaign on March 1, 2019.

Our grandparents came over in the 1800s to work in the railroads, work the lumber camps, goldmines, worked in the canneries, farmland that most people thought could never raise a crop, worked as merchants in cities that were just emerging. They fought in world wars, died for our freedoms and our liberties. Asian Americans have given our blood, sweat and tears to the communities and to this country. There's a prosperity that we on the west coast enjoy. So much of the prosperity and progress of the western states is because of the blood, sweat and tears of Asian Americans. From doing the dirty work to fighting in our world wars and contributing to our society now as doctors, researchers, people in high tech, as innovators, in all different professions. We have every right, indeed a responsibility, to help set the policies that will move our communities and our nation forward.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kagy |first1=Tom |title=Gary Locke: Governor

Our grandparents came over in the 1800s to work in the railroads, work the lumber camps, goldmines, worked in the canneries, farmland that most people thought could never raise a crop, worked as merchants in cities that were just emerging. They fought in world wars, died for our freedoms and our liberties. Asian Americans have given our blood, sweat and tears to the communities and to this country. There's a prosperity that we on the west coast enjoy. So much of the prosperity and progress of the western states is because of the blood, sweat and tears of Asian Americans. From doing the dirty work to fighting in our world wars and contributing to our society now as doctors, researchers, people in high tech, as innovators, in all different professions.

A popular lyric circulating as early as 2,000 years ago in the late [[Han period]] includes an anecdote which relates how a man far away from home sent back to his wife a pair of carp ({{zh|s=\u9ca4\u9c7c|p=Liyu}}), in which, when the wife opened the fish to cook, she found a silk strip that carried a love note of just two lines: \u201cEat well to keep fit, missing you and forget me not\u201d.\n\nAt the [[Yellow River]] at [[Henan]] (Chinese: \u6cb3\u5357; pinyin: H\u00e9n\u00e1n; Wade\u2013Giles: Ho-nan) is a waterfall called the Dragon Gate. It is said that if certain carp called ''yulong'' can climb the cataract, they will transform into dragons. Every year in the third month of spring, they swim up from the sea and gather in vast numbers in the pool at the foot of the falls. It used to be said that only 71 could make the climb in any year. When the first succeeded, then the rains would begin to fall. This Dragon Gate was said to have been created after the flood by the god-emperor Yu, who split a mountain blocking the path of the Yellow River. It was so famous that throughout China was a common saying, \"a student facing his examinations is like a carp attempting to leap the Dragon Gate.\"\n\nHenan is not the only place where this happens. Many other waterfalls in China also have the name Dragon Gate and much the same is said about them. Other famous Dragon Gates are on the Wei River where it passes through the Lung Sheu Mountains and at Tsin in Shanxi Province.\n\nThe fish's jumping feature is set in such a proverbial idiom as \"''Liyu'' (Carp) jumps over the Dragon Gate ({{zh|s=\u9ca4\u8dc3\u9f99\u95e8}}),\" an idiom that conveys a vivid image symbolizing a sudden uplifting in one's social status, as when one ascends into the upper society or has found favor with the royal or a noble family, perhaps through marriage, but in particular through success in the [[imperial examination]].  It is therefore an idiom often used to encourage students or children to achieve success through hard work and perseverance.   This symbolic image, as well as the image of carp itself, has been one of the most popular themes in Chinese paintings, especially those of popular styles. The fish is usually colored in gold or pink, shimmering with an unmistakably auspicious tone. Yuquan (\u7389\u6cc9 in Chinese), one of the well-known scenic spots in Hangzhou, has a large fish pond alive with hundreds of carp of various colors.  A three-character inscription, ''Yu-Le-Guo'' (\u9c7c\u4e50\u56fd), meaning \"fish's paradise\", is set above one end of the pond in the calligraphy of a famous gentry-scholar of the late [[Ming Dynasty]] named Dong Qichang ({{zh|s=\u8463\u5176\u660c}}).  Many tourists feed the fish with bread crumbs.\n\nAmong the various kinds of carp, the silver carp is least expensive in China. The grass carp is still a main delicacy in Hangzhou cuisine. Restaurants along the West Lake of the city keep the fish in cages submerged in the lake water right in front of the restaurant; on an order from a customer, they dash a live fish on the pavement to kill it before cooking. The fish is normally served with a vinegar-based sweet-and-sour sauce ({{zh|s=\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c}}).\n\n==Jumping ability==\nSilver carp are easily frightened by boats, which cause them to leap up to {{convert|2.5|-|3.0|m|ft|0}} into the air, and numerous boaters have been severely injured by collisions with the fish.<ref>[http://www.lib.niu.edu/2002/oi020508.html P.J.

Some recipes are specifically for carp such as {{illm|T\u00e1ngc\u00f9 L\u01d0y\u00fa|zh|\u7cd6\u918b\u9bc9\u9b5a}} (sweet-and-sour carp) and {{illm|Koikoku|ja|\u9bc9\u3053\u304f}} (thick [[miso]] soup with carp). However, many people in North America do not distinguish the various Asian carp species and see them all as undesirable food fish because of their perceived [[Demersal fish|bottom-feeding]] behavior, while, in fact, only some species are bottom-feeders. Furthermore even the bottom-feeding species such as the common carp, a highly bony species which was introduced to North America from Eurasia in the 17th century, are important food fish outside North America.<ref>Gallagher, Jim, [http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/article_9492759b-5968-5021-9c13-23168664f0d3.html \"Let them eat carp: Illinois to feed pest fish to the poor\"], ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', July 14, 2011 4:45 pm.</ref>\n\nThe pearly white flesh\u2014complicated by a series of bones\u2014is said to taste like [[cod]] or described as tasting like a cross between [[scallop]]s and [[crab]]meat.

The black carp feeds on native mussels and snails, some of which can be already endangered. Grass carp can alter the [[food web]]s of a new environment by altering the communities of plants, invertebrates, and fish. Silver carp feed on the [[plankton]] necessary for larval fish and native mussels.<ref>[https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/profile/silver-carp Silver Carp] ''USDA National Agricultural Library''. Retrieved 29 August 2019.</ref>\n\n===North America===\n{{Main article|Asian carp in North America}}\nBecause of their prominence, and because they were imported to the United States much later than other carp native to Asia, the term \"Asian carp\" is often used with the intended meaning of only grass, black, silver, and bighead carp. In the U.S., Asian carp are considered to be invasive species. Of the Asian carp introduced to the United States, only two (crucian and black carp) are not known to be firmly established. Crucian carp is probably [[local extinction|extirpated]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.asp?speciesID=509 |title=Species FactSheet: Carassius carassius |last=Fuller |first=Pam |date=2005-06-07 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> Since 2003, however, several adult, fertile black carp have been captured from the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]] and other rivers connected to the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=573 |title=Species FactSheet: Mylopharyngodon piceus |last=Fuller |first=Pam |date=2005-06-07 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> Dr. Leo Nico, in the book ''Black carp: Biological Synopsis and Risk Assessment of an Introduced Fish'', reports that black carp are probably established in the United States. In [[South Florida]], the local water management district actually stocks the canals with sterilized grass carp to control the [[hydrilla]] plant, which tends to block the locks and drainage valves used to control water flow from the [[Everglades]].\n\nBighead and silver carp feed by filtering plankton from the water.  The extremely high abundance of bighead and silver carp has caused great concern because of the potential for competition with native species for food and living space. Because of their filter-feeding habits, they are difficult to capture by normal angling methods.\n\n====History====\nIn the late 19th century, the common carp was distributed widely throughout the United States by the [[United States Fish Commission]] as a foodfish.<ref name=\"NASCyprinusCarpio\">{{Cite web|url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.asp?speciesID=509 |title=Species FactSheet: Cyprinus carpio |last=Fuller |first=Pam |date=2005-06-07 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> \nIn the 1970s, fish farmers in mostly southern states began importing Asian carp from China to help clean their commercial ponds.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/the-carp-must-die-02162012.html The Carp Must Die] in [[BusinessWeek]], February 16, 2012</ref><ref>[http://host.madison.com/news/local/great-lakes-states-sue-to-stop-asian-carp-invasion/article_fb5b0e6a-ffc8-11de-89ef-001cc4c002e0.html Great Lakes states sue to stop Asian carp invasion] in ''The Capital Times'', 13 January 2010.</ref> The rise in the populations of bighead and silver carp has been dramatic where they are established in the Mississippi River basin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/reports_publications/psrs/psr_2000_05.html |title=Asian Carp Invasion of the Upper Mississippi River System |first=Todd M. |last=Koel |author2=Kevin S.

Bighead, silver, and grass carp have been captured in that watershed from Louisiana to South Dakota, Minnesota, and Ohio. Grass carp are also established in at least one other watershed, in Texas, and may be established elsewhere.\n\n[[File:Asian Carp, Shedd Aquarium, Chicago.webmhd.webm|thumb|Asian carp, Shedd Aquarium, Chicago]]\nGrass carp have been captured in all of the [[Great Lakes]] except [[Lake Superior]], but so far, no evidence indicates a reproducing population. No silver carp or black carp have yet been found in any of the Great Lakes.  Common carp are abundant throughout the Great Lakes.\n\nA few bighead and grass carp have been captured in Canada's portions of the Great Lakes, but no Asian carp (other than common carp) is known to be established in Canada at this time. Concerns exist that the silver carp may spread into [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]] in [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] through [[Battle Creek (Milk River)]], the [[Frenchman River]], and other rivers flowing south out of the hills into the [[Milk River (Alberta\u2013Montana)|Milk River]].  \n\nIn Mexico, grass carp have been established for many years in at least two river systems, where they are considered invasive, but no other Asian carp are known to have been introduced.\n\n====Management====\nThese fish are thought to be highly detrimental to the environment in parts of the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|first1=Caryn |last1=Rousseau |first2=John |last2=Flesher |title=Fears mount over giant carp reaching Great Lakes |date=2009-12-02 |agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hs63FD_eLJEQ2gB94JLywKNtuF2AD9CBF2680 |accessdate=2009-12-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206091331/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hs63FD_eLJEQ2gB94JLywKNtuF2AD9CBF2680 |archivedate=December 6, 2009 }}</ref>  Because of these concerns, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] convened stakeholders to develop a national plan for the management and control of invasive Asian carp (referring to bighead, silver, black, and grass carp).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://images.google.com/images?hl=en&source=hp&q=mack&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi |format=PDF|title=Draft Management and Control Plan for Asian Carp in the United States |author=Asian Carp Working Group |author2=Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force |date=April 2006 |publisher=Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force |accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> The plan was accepted by the National Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force in the fall of 2007.\n\nAs of 2016, efforts were being made to reintroduce [[alligator gar]] between Tennessee and Illinois as part of an effort to control Asian carp.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Webber |first1=Tammy |title=Once-hated fish now sought to combat Asian carp |url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/07/29/alligator-gar-combat-asian-carp/87699102/ |accessdate=22 August 2019 |work=Detroit Free Press |agency=Associated Press |date=29 July 2016 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 the Commonwealth of Kentucky declared \"War on Carp\" and started to use electro-fishing and sonic devices to remove 5 million pounds of Asian carp from [[Lake Barkley]] and [[Kentucky Lake]] <ref>https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/asian-carp-have-taken-over-kentuckys-lakes-and-officials-are-using-shocking-boats-to-count-them</ref>\n\n====Legislation====\nThe Stop Asian Carp Act of 2011 was introduced to require the Secretary of the Army to study the feasibility of the hydrological separation, such as electric barriers, of the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s471/text|title=Text of the Stop Asian Carp Act of 2011|date=March 3, 2011|work=[[GovTrack]]|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref>  The act provided 30 days for the Secretary of the Army to begin a study on the best means of implementing a hydrological separation of the Great Lakes to prevent the introduction of Asian carp.

Aquaculture 129(1-4):3-48</ref> so they are sometimes called a \"Eurasian\" carp.\n\n[[File:Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico de Quito (Koi pond, Ecuador.).jpg|thumb|Asian carp, swimming at a Koi pond inside the Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico de [[Quito]].]]\n\n==In Chinese culture==\n{{Further information|Fish in Chinese mythology}}\n\nA long tradition of Asian carp exists in Chinese culture and literature.  A popular lyric circulating as early as 2,000 years ago in the late [[Han period]] includes an anecdote which relates how a man far away from home sent back to his wife a pair of carp ({{zh|s=\u9ca4\u9c7c|p=Liyu}}), in which, when the wife opened the fish to cook, she found a silk strip that carried a love note of just two lines: \u201cEat well to keep fit, missing you and forget me not\u201d.\n\nAt the [[Yellow River]] at [[Henan]] (Chinese: \u6cb3\u5357; pinyin: H\u00e9n\u00e1n; Wade\u2013Giles: Ho-nan) is a waterfall called the Dragon Gate. It is said that if certain carp called ''yulong'' can climb the cataract, they will transform into dragons. Every year in the third month of spring, they swim up from the sea and gather in vast numbers in the pool at the foot of the falls. It used to be said that only 71 could make the climb in any year. When the first succeeded, then the rains would begin to fall. This Dragon Gate was said to have been created after the flood by the god-emperor Yu, who split a mountain blocking the path of the Yellow River. It was so famous that throughout China was a common saying, \"a student facing his examinations is like a carp attempting to leap the Dragon Gate.\"\n\nHenan is not the only place where this happens. Many other waterfalls in China also have the name Dragon Gate and much the same is said about them. Other famous Dragon Gates are on the Wei River where it passes through the Lung Sheu Mountains and at Tsin in Shanxi Province.\n\nThe fish's jumping feature is set in such a proverbial idiom as \"''Liyu'' (Carp) jumps over the Dragon Gate ({{zh|s=\u9ca4\u8dc3\u9f99\u95e8}}),\" an idiom that conveys a vivid image symbolizing a sudden uplifting in one's social status, as when one ascends into the upper society or has found favor with the royal or a noble family, perhaps through marriage, but in particular through success in the [[imperial examination]].  It is therefore an idiom often used to encourage students or children to achieve success through hard work and perseverance.   This symbolic image, as well as the image of carp itself, has been one of the most popular themes in Chinese paintings, especially those of popular styles. The fish is usually colored in gold or pink, shimmering with an unmistakably auspicious tone. Yuquan (\u7389\u6cc9 in Chinese), one of the well-known scenic spots in Hangzhou, has a large fish pond alive with hundreds of carp of various colors.  A three-character inscription, ''Yu-Le-Guo'' (\u9c7c\u4e50\u56fd), meaning \"fish's paradise\", is set above one end of the pond in the calligraphy of a famous gentry-scholar of the late [[Ming Dynasty]] named Dong Qichang ({{zh|s=\u8463\u5176\u660c}}).  Many tourists feed the fish with bread crumbs.\n\nAmong the various kinds of carp, the silver carp is least expensive in China. The grass carp is still a main delicacy in Hangzhou cuisine. Restaurants along the West Lake of the city keep the fish in cages submerged in the lake water right in front of the restaurant; on an order from a customer, they dash a live fish on the pavement to kill it before cooking. The fish is normally served with a vinegar-based sweet-and-sour sauce ({{zh|s=\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c}}).\n\n==Jumping ability==\nSilver carp are easily frightened by boats, which cause them to leap up to {{convert|2.5|-|3.0|m|ft|0}} into the air, and numerous boaters have been severely injured by collisions with the fish.<ref>[http://www.lib.niu.edu/2002/oi020508.html P.J.

Some recipes are specifically for carp such as {{illm|T\u00e1ngc\u00f9 L\u01d0y\u00fa|zh|\u7cd6\u918b\u9bc9\u9b5a}} (sweet-and-sour carp) and {{illm|Koikoku|ja|\u9bc9\u3053\u304f}} (thick [[miso]] soup with carp). However, many people in North America do not distinguish the various Asian carp species and see them all as undesirable food fish because of their perceived [[Demersal fish|bottom-feeding]] behavior, while, in fact, only some species are bottom-feeders. Furthermore even the bottom-feeding species such as the common carp, a highly bony species which was introduced to North America from Eurasia in the 17th century, are important food fish outside North America.<ref>Gallagher, Jim, [http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/article_9492759b-5968-5021-9c13-23168664f0d3.html \"Let them eat carp: Illinois to feed pest fish to the poor\"], ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', July 14, 2011 4:45 pm.</ref>\n\nThe pearly white flesh\u2014complicated by a series of bones\u2014is said to taste like [[cod]] or described as tasting like a cross between [[scallop]]s and [[crab]]meat.

The black carp feeds on native mussels and snails, some of which can be already endangered. Grass carp can alter the [[food web]]s of a new environment by altering the communities of plants, invertebrates, and fish. Silver carp feed on the [[plankton]] necessary for larval fish and native mussels.<ref>[https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/profile/silver-carp Silver Carp] ''USDA National Agricultural Library''. Retrieved 29 August 2019.</ref>\n\n===North America===\n{{Main article|Asian carp in North America}}\nBecause of their prominence, and because they were imported to the United States much later than other carp native to Asia, the term \"Asian carp\" is often used with the intended meaning of only grass, black, silver, and bighead carp. In the U.S., Asian carp are considered to be invasive species. Of the Asian carp introduced to the United States, only two (crucian and black carp) are not known to be firmly established. Crucian carp is probably [[local extinction|extirpated]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.asp?speciesID=509 |title=Species FactSheet: Carassius carassius |last=Fuller |first=Pam |date=2005-06-07 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> Since 2003, however, several adult, fertile black carp have been captured from the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]] and other rivers connected to the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=573 |title=Species FactSheet: Mylopharyngodon piceus |last=Fuller |first=Pam |date=2005-06-07 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> Dr. Leo Nico, in the book ''Black carp: Biological Synopsis and Risk Assessment of an Introduced Fish'', reports that black carp are probably established in the United States. In [[South Florida]], the local water management district actually stocks the canals with sterilized grass carp to control the [[hydrilla]] plant, which tends to block the locks and drainage valves used to control water flow from the [[Everglades]].\n\nBighead and silver carp feed by filtering plankton from the water.  The extremely high abundance of bighead and silver carp has caused great concern because of the potential for competition with native species for food and living space. Because of their filter-feeding habits, they are difficult to capture by normal angling methods.\n\n====History====\nIn the late 19th century, the common carp was distributed widely throughout the United States by the [[United States Fish Commission]] as a foodfish.<ref name=\"NASCyprinusCarpio\">{{Cite web|url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.asp?speciesID=509 |title=Species FactSheet: Cyprinus carpio |last=Fuller |first=Pam |date=2005-06-07 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> \nIn the 1970s, fish farmers in mostly southern states began importing Asian carp from China to help clean their commercial ponds.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/the-carp-must-die-02162012.html The Carp Must Die] in [[BusinessWeek]], February 16, 2012</ref><ref>[http://host.madison.com/news/local/great-lakes-states-sue-to-stop-asian-carp-invasion/article_fb5b0e6a-ffc8-11de-89ef-001cc4c002e0.html Great Lakes states sue to stop Asian carp invasion] in ''The Capital Times'', 13 January 2010.</ref> The rise in the populations of bighead and silver carp has been dramatic where they are established in the Mississippi River basin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/reports_publications/psrs/psr_2000_05.html |title=Asian Carp Invasion of the Upper Mississippi River System |first=Todd M. |last=Koel |author2=Kevin S.

Bighead, silver, and grass carp have been captured in that watershed from Louisiana to South Dakota, Minnesota, and Ohio. Grass carp are also established in at least one other watershed, in Texas, and may be established elsewhere.\n\n[[File:Asian Carp, Shedd Aquarium, Chicago.webmhd.webm|thumb|Asian carp, Shedd Aquarium, Chicago]]\nGrass carp have been captured in all of the [[Great Lakes]] except [[Lake Superior]], but so far, no evidence indicates a reproducing population. No silver carp or black carp have yet been found in any of the Great Lakes.  Common carp are abundant throughout the Great Lakes.\n\nA few bighead and grass carp have been captured in Canada's portions of the Great Lakes, but no Asian carp (other than common carp) is known to be established in Canada at this time. Concerns exist that the silver carp may spread into [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]] in [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] through [[Battle Creek (Milk River)]], the [[Frenchman River]], and other rivers flowing south out of the hills into the [[Milk River (Alberta\u2013Montana)|Milk River]].  \n\nIn Mexico, grass carp have been established for many years in at least two river systems, where they are considered invasive, but no other Asian carp are known to have been introduced.\n\n====Management====\nThese fish are thought to be highly detrimental to the environment in parts of the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|first1=Caryn |last1=Rousseau |first2=John |last2=Flesher |title=Fears mount over giant carp reaching Great Lakes |date=2009-12-02 |agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hs63FD_eLJEQ2gB94JLywKNtuF2AD9CBF2680 |accessdate=2009-12-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206091331/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hs63FD_eLJEQ2gB94JLywKNtuF2AD9CBF2680 |archivedate=December 6, 2009 }}</ref>  Because of these concerns, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] convened stakeholders to develop a national plan for the management and control of invasive Asian carp (referring to bighead, silver, black, and grass carp).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://images.google.com/images?hl=en&source=hp&q=mack&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi |format=PDF|title=Draft Management and Control Plan for Asian Carp in the United States |author=Asian Carp Working Group |author2=Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force |date=April 2006 |publisher=Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force |accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> The plan was accepted by the National Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force in the fall of 2007.\n\nAs of 2016, efforts were being made to reintroduce [[alligator gar]] between Tennessee and Illinois as part of an effort to control Asian carp.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Webber |first1=Tammy |title=Once-hated fish now sought to combat Asian carp |url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/07/29/alligator-gar-combat-asian-carp/87699102/ |accessdate=22 August 2019 |work=Detroit Free Press |agency=Associated Press |date=29 July 2016 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 the Commonwealth of Kentucky declared \"War on Carp\" and started to use electro-fishing and sonic devices to remove 5 million pounds of Asian carp from [[Lake Barkley]] and [[Kentucky Lake]] <ref>https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/asian-carp-have-taken-over-kentuckys-lakes-and-officials-are-using-shocking-boats-to-count-them</ref>\n\n====Legislation====\nThe Stop Asian Carp Act of 2011 was introduced to require the Secretary of the Army to study the feasibility of the hydrological separation, such as electric barriers, of the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s471/text|title=Text of the Stop Asian Carp Act of 2011|date=March 3, 2011|work=[[GovTrack]]|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref>  The act provided 30 days for the Secretary of the Army to begin a study on the best means of implementing a hydrological separation of the Great Lakes to prevent the introduction of Asian carp.
