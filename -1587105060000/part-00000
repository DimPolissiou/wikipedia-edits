He\u2019d usually come in with his wife, Margaret, who played some pretty tasty boogie woogie piano. He had very long, flaming red hair down his back and always wore old Hawaiian shirts that were popular at that time. He looked like he just rolled out of bed. His appearance was a bit gruff. We affectionately called him 'Red.' He was always in very deep thought and a bit uptight too, like he was getting ready to explode, but always a very nice guy.\"<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>In the late 1970s, the Saloon, the oldest running saloon in San Francisco,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfblues.net/Saloon.html|title=San Francisco Blues on SFBlues.net: The Saloon|website=www.sfblues.net|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> became a local hub for blues.<ref name=\":9\" /> The owner at the time, Tommy Browne, decided to offer live music shows on weekends. [[Lisa Kindred]], who had previously played music in the [[American folk music revival|Greenwich Village folk]]  and Chicago blues scenes, was a bartender at the Saloon at the time. She began to play blues at the bar with Gino Skaggs. Eventually, Nitro began to play with both of them.<ref name=\":9\" /> They developed an eight-piece blues band, in which both Nitro played the guitar. Ron Thompson also played the guitar On some nights, musicians such as [[Nick Gravenites]], [[John Cipollina]], [[Charlie Musselwhite]], and [[Roy Rogers (guitarist)|Roy Rogers]] played with the band.

In North Beach, the band played at the Saloon on Friday and Sunday nights, Lost and Found (formerly known as the Coffee Gallery) on weekends, and at Grant & Green Saloon.

His dad often took John and his brother to the Stock Car races which influenced Johnny's passion for drag racing and his hobby of building and collecting model car kits.\n\nJohnny was a very talented artist and musician during his high school years. After school, he spent many hours drawing, painting or playing his guitar. On weekends, he performed at parties and local events as the lead guitarist in two different \"Cover Tune\" bands. The first band he formed was called \"The Renegades\" and the second was \"Albatross\". He graduated in 1969 from C.K.

He had very long, flaming red hair down his back and always wore old Hawaiian shirts that were popular at that time. He looked like he just rolled out of bed. His appearance was a bit gruff. We affectionately called him 'Red.' He was always in very deep thought and a bit uptight too, like he was getting ready to explode, but always a very nice guy.\"<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>In the late 1970s, the Saloon, the oldest running saloon in San Francisco,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfblues.net/Saloon.html|title=San Francisco Blues on SFBlues.net: The Saloon|website=www.sfblues.net|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> became a local hub for blues.<ref name=\":9\" /> The owner at the time, Tommy Browne, decided to offer live music shows on weekends. [[Lisa Kindred]], who had previously played music in the [[American folk music revival|Greenwich Village folk]]  and Chicago blues scenes, was a bartender at the Saloon at the time. She began to play blues at the bar with Gino Skaggs.

His dad often took John and his brother to the Stock Car races which influenced Johnny's passion for drag racing and his hobby of building and collecting model car kits.\n\nJohnny was a very talented artist and musician during his high school years. After school, he spent many hours drawing, painting or playing his guitar. On weekends, he performed at parties and local events as the lead guitarist in two different \"Cover Tune\" bands. The first band he formed was called \"The Renegades\" and the second was \"Albatross\". He graduated in 1969 from C.K. McClatchy High School and soon after moved to the bay area to attend the San Francisco Art Institute.\n\nAs an adult, Nitro was interested in [[metaphysics]].

It is particularly controversial in terms of computer software. The code would automatically make a software maker liable for defects and errors in the program. However, it allows a [[shrinkwrap license]] to override any of UCITA's provisions. As a result, commercial software makers can include such a license in the box and not be liable for errors in the software. Free software that is normally distributed through downloads, however, would not be able to force a shrinkwrap license and would therefore be liable for errors. Small software makers without legal knowledge would also be at risk.<ref name=gnu/>\n\nUCITA would explicitly allow software makers to make any legal restrictions they want on their software by calling the software a license in the [[EULA]], rather than a sale. This would therefore take away purchasers right to resell used software under the [[first sale doctrine]]. Without UCITA, courts have often ruled that despite the EULA claiming a license, the actual actions by the software company and purchaser clearly shows it was a purchase, meaning that the purchaser has the right to resell the software to anyone.\n\n==History==\nUCITA started as an attempt to modify the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] by introducing a new article: Article 2B (also known as UCC2B).<ref name=\"jamesshuggins\" />\nThe committee for drafting UCC2B consisted of members from both the NCCUSL and the [[American Law Institute]] (ALI). At a certain stage of the process, ALI withdrew from the drafting process, effectively killing UCC2B. Afterwards, the NCCUSL renamed UCC2B into UCITA and proceeded on its own.<ref name=\"jamesshuggins\" />\n\n==Passage Record==\nBefore ratification, each state may amend its practices, thus creating different conditions in each state. This means that the final \"as read\" UCITA document is what is actually passed and signed into law by each state governor.  The passage record typically indicates each version of UCITA submitted for ratification.\n\nTwo states, Virginia and Maryland, passed UCITA in 2000, shortly after its completion by the NCCUSL in 1999.  However, beginning with Iowa that same year, numerous additional states have passed so-called [[UCITA bomb-shelter|\"bomb-shelter\"]] laws enabling citizen protections against UCITA-like provisions.\n\n; Passage of UCITA\n* Maryland (passed April 2000): http://mlis.state.md.us/2000rs/billfile/hb0019.htm \n* Virginia (passed 2000) : http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?001+ful+SB372ER\n\n; Passage of Anti-UCITA Bomb Shelter Laws (UETA)\n* Iowa (passed 2000)\n* North Carolina (passed 2001)\n* West Virginia (2001) \n* Vermont (passed 2003)\n* Idaho\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Uniform Acts (United States)]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Computing legislation]]\n[[Category:Uniform Acts|Computer information transactions]]\n[[Category:1999 in law]]\n", "text_old": " {{missing information|why the UCITA is so controversial and opposed by many|date=July 2018}}\n'''''Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act'' (UCITA)''' was an attempt to introduce a [[Uniform Act]] for US States to follow.

The law did not pass in other states.<ref name=\"computerworld\"/> Nevertheless, legal scholars, such as noted commercial law professor Jean Braucher, believe that the UCITA offers academic value.<ref name=\"computerworld\"/>\n\nA resolution recommending approval of UCITA by the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) has been withdrawn by the NCCUSL in 2003, indicating that UCITA lacks the consensus which is necessary for it to become a [[uniform act]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/22575/ |title=UCITA withdrawn from the ABA |website=[[LWN.net]] |author=<!--Not clear who the author is--> |date=February 12, 2003 |accessdate=June 8, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Provisions==\nUCITA focuses on adapting current commercial trade laws to the modern software era. It is particularly controversial in terms of computer software. The code would automatically make a software maker liable for defects and errors in the program. However, it allows a [[shrinkwrap license]] to override any of UCITA's provisions. As a result, commercial software makers can include such a license in the box and not be liable for errors in the software. Free software that is normally distributed through downloads, however, would not be able to force a shrinkwrap license and would therefore be liable for errors. Small software makers without legal knowledge would also be at risk.<ref name=gnu/>\n\nUCITA would explicitly allow software makers to make any legal restrictions they want on their software by calling the software a license in the [[EULA]], rather than a sale. This would therefore take away purchasers right to resell used software under the [[first sale doctrine]]. Without UCITA, courts have often ruled that despite the EULA claiming a license, the actual actions by the software company and purchaser clearly shows it was a purchase, meaning that the purchaser has the right to resell the software to anyone.\n\n==History==\nUCITA started as an attempt to modify the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] by introducing a new article: Article 2B (also known as UCC2B).<ref name=\"jamesshuggins\" />\nThe committee for drafting UCC2B consisted of members from both the NCCUSL and the [[American Law Institute]] (ALI). At a certain stage of the process, ALI withdrew from the drafting process, effectively killing UCC2B. Afterwards, the NCCUSL renamed UCC2B into UCITA and proceeded on its own.<ref name=\"jamesshuggins\" />\n\n==Passage Record==\nBefore ratification, each state may amend its practices, thus creating different conditions in each state. This means that the final \"as read\" UCITA document is what is actually passed and signed into law by each state governor.  The passage record typically indicates each version of UCITA submitted for ratification.\n\nTwo states, Virginia and Maryland, passed UCITA in 2000, shortly after its completion by the NCCUSL in 1999.  However, beginning with Iowa that same year, numerous additional states have passed so-called [[UCITA bomb-shelter|\"bomb-shelter\"]] laws enabling citizen protections against UCITA-like provisions.\n\n; Passage of UCITA\n* Maryland (passed April 2000): http://mlis.state.md.us/2000rs/billfile/hb0019.htm \n* Virginia (passed 2000) : http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?001+ful+SB372ER\n\n; Passage of Anti-UCITA Bomb Shelter Laws (UETA)\n* Iowa (passed 2000)\n* North Carolina (passed 2001)\n* West Virginia (2001) \n* Vermont (passed 2003)\n* Idaho\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Uniform Acts (United States)]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Computing legislation]]\n[[Category:Uniform Acts|Computer information transactions]]\n[[Category:1999 in law]]\n", "name_user": "Katgh0st", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed dead link of a citation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Computer_Information_Transactions_Act"}
