His heels remain close to the bases of the pedals, but he doesn't actually touch the pedal board. All the weight of his legs fall on the balls of his feet. When playing at slower bpms, Kollias's legs do the vast majority of the movement of a kick, moving up and down as much as the pedal does itself. However, as his speed increases, the heels of his feet move less and less, until the [[Tempo|bpm]] is high enough that all the movement of the pedals stems from his ankles. Once he gets up to speeds that are this fast, he employs a swivel technique. In this technique, he uses his feet to keep count of the beats he has hit, moving his ankles to the right side of the pedal and then swinging them over to the other side of the pedal. In this way, as he explains, the extra energy that one's legs waste when they work so hard is utilized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA4Sq0mqU-k |title=George Kollias Foot technique |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-06-30 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>\n\nKollias's hand technique allows him great precision as well, though it is not nearly as individualistic as his foot technique. Kollias grips the stick fully with his index through ring finger, letting them stretch forward and wrap around the stick. He does not use his thumb and index finger to create a swivel. Instead, all of his speed stems from his wrists, much like his ankle usage in the kick.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDEA9Jy5VcA |title=George Kollias Blast Beat |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-11 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}\n\n===With [[Nile (band)|Nile]]===\n{{further|Nile discography}}\n* ''[[Annihilation of the Wicked]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Ithyphallic (album)|Ithyphallic]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Those Whom the Gods Detest]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[At the Gate of Sethu]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[What Should Not Be Unearthed]]'' (2015)\n* ''[[Vile Nilotic Rites]]'' (2019)\n\n===With Cerebrum===\n* ''Spectral Extravagance'' (2009)\n* ''Cosmic Enigma'' (2013)\n\n===With Sickening Horror===\n* ''When Landscapes Bled Backwards'' (2007)\n\n===With [[Nightfall (Greek band)|Nightfall]]===\n* ''[[I Am Jesus]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Lyssa: Rural Gods and Astonishing Punishments]]'' (2004)\n\n===With Extremity Obsession===\n* ''Extremity Obsession'' (Demo, 1996)\n* ''Everlasting'' (Demo, 1997)\n\n===With Deus Infestus===\n* ''Swansongs For This Stillborn Race'' (2010)\n\n===Personal releases===\n* ''Intense Metal Drumming DVD'' (DVD, 2008)\n* ''Intense Metal Drumming II DVD'' (DVD, 2012)\n* ''[[Invictus (George Kollias album)|Invictus]]'' (LP, 2015)\n\n===With ADE===\n* ''Spartacus'' (2013)\n\n===With [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]]===\n* ''Valkyrja'' (2013)\n\n===With Contrarian===\n* ''Predestined'' (2014)\n* ''Polemic'' (2015)\n* ''To Perceive Is To Suffer'' (2017)\n\n===With Demonstealer===\n* ''This Burden Is Mine'' (2016)\n\n==Gear==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{{intricate detail|date=December 2016}}\n*[[Pearl]] Reference Pure Series in # Piano Black<ref name=\"www.pearleurope.com\"/>\n** 22 x 18 Kick\n** 22 x 18 Kick\n** 08 x 07 Tom\n** 10 x 08 Tom\n** 12 x 09 Tom\n** 13 x 10 Tom\n** 14 x 12 Tom (left side)\n** 14 x 14 Floor Tom\n** 16 x 16 Floor Tom\n** 14 x 6.5 Snare\n** 12 x 5 Snare\n*[[Vic Firth]] Drumsticks<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vicfirth.com/artists/kollias.php |title=Vic Firth Artist: George Kollias |publisher=Vicfirth.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926214858/http://www.vicfirth.com/artists/kollias.php |archive-date=2011-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n**SGK George Kollias Signature\n*[[Pearl]] Hardware\n**DR-503C, DR-501C and RJ-50 complete Rack System.\n**DP-2002 Powershift Eliminator Double Pedal\n**H-2000 Eliminator Hi Hat Stand.\n**RH-2000 Eliminator Remote Hi Hat Stand\n**CLH-1000 Hi Hat Arms\n**S-2000 Snare Stand\n**B-1000 Boom Stands\n**CH-1000 Boom Arms\n**PCX-100 and PCX-200 Pipe Clamps\n**D-1000 Roadster Throne\n**TH-2000I and TH-2000S Tom Holders\n**OptiMount Suspension System for all toms\n**AX-20, AX-25 and AX-28 Adapters\n**UX-80 Universal Clamp\n*Extreme Isolation Headphones invented by LA studio session drummer and founder of Direct Sound in 2000, Johnny J Gresko\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Sabian]] Cymbals<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabian.com/EN/artists/George_Kollias.cfm |title=George Kollias &#124;

When playing at slower bpms, Kollias's legs do the vast majority of the movement of a kick, moving up and down as much as the pedal does itself. However, as his speed increases, the heels of his feet move less and less, until the [[Tempo|bpm]] is high enough that all the movement of the pedals stems from his ankles. Once he gets up to speeds that are this fast, he employs a swivel technique. In this technique, he uses his feet to keep count of the beats he has hit, moving his ankles to the right side of the pedal and then swinging them over to the other side of the pedal. In this way, as he explains, the extra energy that one's legs waste when they work so hard is utilized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA4Sq0mqU-k |title=George Kollias Foot technique |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-06-30 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>\n\nKollias's hand technique allows him great precision as well, though it is not nearly as individualistic as his foot technique. Kollias grips the stick fully with his index through ring finger, letting them stretch forward and wrap around the stick. He does not use his thumb and index finger to create a swivel. Instead, all of his speed stems from his wrists, much like his ankle usage in the kick.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDEA9Jy5VcA |title=George Kollias Blast Beat |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-11 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}\n\n===With [[Nile (band)|Nile]]===\n{{further|Nile discography}}\n* ''[[Annihilation of the Wicked]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Ithyphallic (album)|Ithyphallic]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Those Whom the Gods Detest]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[At the Gate of Sethu]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[What Should Not Be Unearthed]]'' (2015)\n* ''[[Vile Nilotic Rites]]'' (2019)\n\n===With Cerebrum===\n* ''Spectral Extravagance'' (2009)\n* ''Cosmic Enigma'' (2013)\n\n===With Sickening Horror===\n* ''When Landscapes Bled Backwards'' (2007)\n\n===With [[Nightfall (Greek band)|Nightfall]]===\n* ''[[I Am Jesus]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Lyssa: Rural Gods and Astonishing Punishments]]'' (2004)\n\n===With Extremity Obsession===\n* ''Extremity Obsession'' (Demo, 1996)\n* ''Everlasting'' (Demo, 1997)\n\n===With Deus Infestus===\n* ''Swansongs For This Stillborn Race'' (2010)\n\n===Personal releases===\n* ''Intense Metal Drumming DVD'' (DVD, 2008)\n* ''Intense Metal Drumming II DVD'' (DVD, 2012)\n* ''[[Invictus (George Kollias album)|Invictus]]'' (LP, 2015)\n\n===With ADE===\n* ''Spartacus'' (2013)\n\n===With [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]]===\n* ''Valkyrja'' (2013)\n\n===With Contrarian===\n* ''Predestined'' (2014)\n* ''Polemic'' (2015)\n* ''To Perceive Is To Suffer'' (2017)\n\n===With Demonstealer===\n* ''This Burden Is Mine'' (2016)\n\n==Gear==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{{intricate detail|date=December 2016}}\n*[[Pearl]] Reference Pure Series in # Piano Black<ref name=\"www.pearleurope.com\"/>\n** 22 x 18 Kick\n** 22 x 18 Kick\n** 08 x 07 Tom\n** 10 x 08 Tom\n** 12 x 09 Tom\n** 13 x 10 Tom\n** 14 x 12 Tom (left side)\n** 14 x 14 Floor Tom\n** 16 x 16 Floor Tom\n** 14 x 6.5 Snare\n** 12 x 5 Snare\n*[[Vic Firth]] Drumsticks<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vicfirth.com/artists/kollias.php |title=Vic Firth Artist: George Kollias |publisher=Vicfirth.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926214858/http://www.vicfirth.com/artists/kollias.php |archive-date=2011-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n**SGK George Kollias Signature\n*[[Pearl]] Hardware\n**DR-503C, DR-501C and RJ-50 complete Rack System.\n**DP-2002 Powershift Eliminator Double Pedal\n**H-2000 Eliminator Hi Hat Stand.\n**RH-2000 Eliminator Remote Hi Hat Stand\n**CLH-1000 Hi Hat Arms\n**S-2000 Snare Stand\n**B-1000 Boom Stands\n**CH-1000 Boom Arms\n**PCX-100 and PCX-200 Pipe Clamps\n**D-1000 Roadster Throne\n**TH-2000I and TH-2000S Tom Holders\n**OptiMount Suspension System for all toms\n**AX-20, AX-25 and AX-28 Adapters\n**UX-80 Universal Clamp\n*Extreme Isolation Headphones\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Sabian]] Cymbals<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabian.com/EN/artists/George_Kollias.cfm |title=George Kollias &#124;

Several of these initiatives were led by Razaleigh. These initiatives were major corporate takeovers of foreign conglomerates and major industries which was previously owned by foreign shareholders respectively.\n\nDue to his excellent drive and contribution to the country's economy, and his strong economics and finance background, he was entrusted to manage the country's finance and was made the Finance Minister in 1976, Chairman of [[Asian Development Bank]] in 1976, IBRD ([[World Bank]]) and [[IMF]] in 1977, and [[Islamic Development Bank]] in 1978.\n\n===New Straits Times Press===\n\nThe [[New Straits Times Press]] (initially News Straits Times Press Sdn Bhd) was formed by the Directors of the Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, to acquire a majority shareholding in the company which was the largest mass-circulation news organ in the territories of East and West Malaysia.\n\nThe Malaysia operations of the Straits Times, the Sunday Times, the [[Malay Mail]], the Sunday Mail, [[Berita Harian]] and Berita Minggu were transferred to this new company. An agreement was reached in 1972 between the directors of the ''Straits Times group'' and ''Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah'' for the disposal of 80 per cent of the stock of the News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. for the Malaysian interest.<ref>The Straits Times 17 September 1972 page 1, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\n===Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad===\n\nOn 4 June 1965, ''\"Kongres Ekonomi Bumiputra\"'' (Bumiputra Economic Congress), sponsored by the Ministry of National and Rural Development, were held in Kuala Lumpur for 3 days to generate an interest among Malays and other local indigenous groups to participate in commerce and industry. Seven working committees were formed to achieve these objectives.<ref>The Straits Times 5 May 1965 page 18, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\n[[Tun Abdul Razak]], the then Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia announced that the Government had agreed to form a local Bank (\"Bank Bumiputra\") as recommended by the Economic Congress based on a majority of the 69 resolutions passed in the meeting.<ref>The Straits Times 8 May 1965 page 1, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> The Bank, with its initial capital to be provided by the Malaysian Government, would be established. The Bank's ownership would ultimately be sold to the public through shares. On 15 July 1965, Tun Abdul Razak announced the Government agreed to provide RM5 million as the initial capital for Bank Bumiputra.<ref>The Straits Times 15 July 1965 page 11, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> In an event presenting certificate to 80 students at \"Taman Latehan Wanita\", Lornie Road, Tun Abdul Razak reiterated that the main aim of the bank was to assist rural businessmen in the form of loans irrespective of religion.<ref>The Straits Times 4 September 1965 page 11, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\nBank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad was formally launched by Tun Abdul Razak on 1 October 1965 with authorised capital of RM25 million, instead of RM5 million announced earlier.<ref>The Straits Times 1 October 1965 page 1, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> The senior management was headed by Mohd Raslan bin Dato' Abdullah (managing director), former Accountant General of Government and Tengku Razaleigh (Executive Director). The other board members are S.O.K. Ubaidulla (President of United Chamber of Commerce), L.E Osman (a lawyer), K. Mushir Ariff (an incorporated valuer), Wan Yahya bin Haji Mohamad (a businessman from Terengganu), K.D. Eu (a company director, and Kuok Hock Nien (a company director). The general manager of the Bank was Wong Aun Pui, a prominent local banker with 20 years of experience and director of many rubber and palm oil companies.<ref>The Straits Times 10 March 1966 page 10, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\n=== Perbadanan Nasional Berhad (PERNAS) ===\n\nPERNAS (Perbadanan Nasional Berhad or National Corporation) was set up in November 1969 as a wholly owned government company to carry out the resolutions at the Second Bumiputera Economic Congress. Among the major shareholders included were Malaysia's Ministry of Finance, [[Bank Negara Malaysia]] (The Central Bank of Malaysia) and Bank Bumiputera Malaysia Berhad. Pernas was put under a solid footing under the chairmanship of Razaleigh (1970\u20131974) who had been the Minister of Finance from 1976 to 1984.<ref>The Developing Economies, Malaysia's Localization Policy and its impact of British owned Enterprises, Page 372, [[Institute of Developing Economies]], Japan</ref>\n\nWith the background of poor and very low participation of [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputeras]] in the private sector and industries at that time, PERNAS' principle were to:\n* enter undertakings which would bring high economic returns,\n* when enter into joint ventures, PERNAS was to be the majority stockholder with controlling interest over operations,\n* Bumiputeras were to be employed at all levels of operations and undertakings.<ref>The Developing Economies, Malaysia's Localization Policy and its impact of British owned Enterprises, Page 374, [[Institute of Developing Economies]], Japan</ref>\n\n8 subsidiaries were set up under PERNAS to achieve its objective. Malaysia National Insurance Berhad (MNI) was established in April 1970. There followed during 1971 Pernas Construction Sdn. Bhd., Pernas Engineering Sdn. Bhd., and Pernas Securities Sdn. Bhd. Then came Pernas Mining Sdn. Bhd (1973) and Pernas Edar Sdn Bhd (1974).\n\nRazaleigh was in the thick of what became known as the Haw Par imbroglio of the mid-1970s, working with the Singapore-based Haw Par Brothers International Ltd, then an offshoot of the empire of British wheeler-dealer Jim Slater, to acquire control of London Tin Company, the British-controlled tin conglomerate, and the [[Sime Darby]] plantations conglomerate.<ref>The Straits Times 2 January 1976 page 5, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> This was to be achieved through a complex series of transactions by which PERNAS would end up as the largest shareholder of both. It failed when Singapore accused Haw Par of financial irregularities and later jailed a senior executive and the head, Donald Watson, fled to Ireland.\n\nBut it proved a short-lived setback for Razaleigh. Within two years, a share and proxy battle orchestrated by merchant bank Rothschild \u2013 which was also a part owner of Bumiputera Merchant Bankers \u2013 brought Sime Darby under Malaysian control and its headquarters shifted to Kuala Lumpur.

Total trade with China stood at a mere RM105.6 million in 1971, but ballooned to RM1.6 billion in 1980. Since then the contact between the two countries has been on the increase as evidenced by the number of visits of trade, medical and sports delegations to China.\n\n=== Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS)===\n\nOn 6 September 1974, Malaysia's then prime minister, Tun Abdul Razak, announced the appointment of Razaleigh as chairman and Chief Executive of [[PETRONAS]] (Petroliam Nasional Berhad). Tun Razak said:'' \"From among the new blood, I intended to bring Tengku Razaleigh into the Cabinet. However, I have an important job for him, a job as important as that of a Cabinet Minister. I have decided to appoint him as chairman and Chief Executive of PETRONAS, which is equivalent to being a Cabinet Minister.\"''.<ref>The Straits Times 7 September 1974 page 8, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> Subsequently, Razaleigh had to relinquish his job as Chairman of PERNAS which he held from 1970, but retained the chairmanship of Bank Bumiputra.[[File:TRH_Petronas_Delegation_Houston.jpg|right|thumb|Tengku Razaleigh accompanying Tun Razak in a Petronas Delegation to Houston]]\n\n=== Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) ===\n\nThe company was founded on 17 March 1978 based on an idea from Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, as an instrument of the Government's New Economic Policy to promote share ownership among the Bumiputera, and to develop opportunities for deserving Bumiputera professionals to participate in the creation and management of wealth.\n\nToday, PNB is a major investor in Bursa Malaysia, investing nearly 10% of the market capitalisation of the bourse, across most major Malaysian corporations and also actively contributing towards the nation\u2019s human capital development through scholarships and employment opportunities.\n\n===Setting up banking firms and other institutions===\n\nHe also set up \"Bank Pembangunan Malaysia\" and founded and established both Bank Islam and Syarikat Takaful, an insurance company run in accordance with Syariah principles.\n\nInstitute of Marketing Malaysia (IMM) was founded by Razaleigh in 1977 and he became the Institute's first Patron.\n\n===Malaysian & Asean Chamber of Commerce===\n\nRazaleigh was President of Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, President of Malaysian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and consequently the President of ASEAN Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  He played a major role in the strategic restructuring of the Malaysian economy.  The Malaysian Chamber of Commerce acknowledged his expertise in the petroleum business and once called him the \"Malaysian Oil Prince\".  In the 1975 Malaysian Chamber of Commerce resolution, Razaleigh was named \"Father of Malaysian Economic Development\".\n\n==1960s : The early years==\nAs the former president of the Malayan Students Union in London and secretary of the Malay Society in Britain, Razaleigh has entered into politics on 23 April 1962. He was unanimously elected as chairman of the Ulu Kelantan Division of UMNO at its annual meeting. He had returned to Malaya earlier that year to attend the funeral of his father.<ref>The Straits Times 24 April 1962 page 11, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = Perubahan besar dalam UMNO Kelantan|last = Hashim|first = Zakaria|date = 18 July 1962|work = |access-date = |via = |publisher = Straits Times|newspaper = Berita Harian|location = Singapore|page = Page 5|language = Malay}}</ref>\n\nTengku Razaleigh was part of the Malaya's delegation to the [[United Nation]] for 17th Session of the U.N.

Hence, he has the combined title of Yang Berhormat Mulia.

Razaleigh's planning is reputed to have been the main reason the [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition, of which UMNO is a member, almost totally defeated the opposition Islamic party of [[PAS (political party)|PAS]] in the [[1978 Malaysian general election|1978 general election]] and the Kelantan state elections of the same year.<ref name=\"fear_45\"/>\n\n==1980s ==\nWhen [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] succeeded Hussein Onn as Prime Minister, he declared the election for the Deputy Presidency of UMNO \u2013 and thus by extension the Deputy Prime Ministership \u2013 was open; he would not support any candidate. Razaleigh joined the fray, and his main opposition was [[Musa Hitam]].<ref>Tan & Vasil, p. 42.</ref> Eventually, Musa won the election with 722 votes to Razaleigh's 517 votes, becoming the new Deputy President and Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>Tan & Vasil, p. 204.</ref> Razaleigh blamed himself for taking \"a rather passive stance\" and not having a campaign strategy.<ref>Tan & Vasil, p. 112.</ref>\n\nTengku Razaleigh challenged Dr. Mahathir in the [[1987 United Malays National Organisation leadership election|1987 UMNO leadership election]], which Dr. Mahathir managed to retain his party president position. However, UMNO was split into two separate entities as Tengku Razaleigh was left unsatisfied with the result.\n\nThe split forced the Malaysian court to declare UMNO as illegal. Shortly after the court ruling, Dr. Mahathir reestablished UMNO as UMNO Baru (New UMNO), though the new UMNO was badly weakened. Tengku Razaleigh at the same time went on his own path and found a new political party called [[Parti Melayu Semangat 46]] (S46) in 1989. The number 46 refers to the year UMNO was founded.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the [[1993 Malaysian constitutional crisis]], Razaleigh strongly opposed the amendment for Rulers to be tried at court and their legal immunity be stripped. However, his efforts failed to bear fruit as it did not gain enough support. In 1996, Tengku Razaleigh disbanded [[Semangat 46]] and rejoined UMNO.\n\n==2000s==\nIn 2004, he announced his interest for the UMNO top post yet again but failed to garner enough nominations to contest the presidency.\n\n==2010s==\nOn 22 July 2011, [[Angkatan Amanah Merdeka]] (Amanah), a Non-Government Organisation was launched by Razaleigh at Memorial Tunku Abdul Rahman to revive and restore the spirit of Merdeka among Malaysians.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/amanah-diketuai-ku-li-dilancar-jumaat-sandar-amanat-tunku/|title=Amanah diketuai Ku Li dilancar Jumaat, sandar amanat Tunku|publisher=The Malaysian Insider|date=20 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226081953/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/amanah-diketuai-ku-li-dilancar-jumaat-sandar-amanat-tunku/|archivedate=26 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The organisation is led by Razaleigh himself as the President, along with several other public figures and prominent activists.\n\nHe lost his wife, Nur Yvonne Abdullah, who died on June 5, 2015 due to multiple myeloma, a disease she had been suffering from for the previous year.

Razaleigh was educated at English-medium schools and attended [[:ms:Maktab Sultan Ismail|Sultan Ismail College]] before moving on to the [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]] (MCKK). He left MCKK disliking the [[boarding school]] environment there, and transferred to [[:ms:Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Anderson|Anderson School]] in [[Ipoh]], Perak. He received a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the [[Queen's University of Belfast]] in 1959 and later continued his studies at [[Lincoln's Inn]]. However, upon his father's death, he was forced to return and never continued his studies.<ref name=\"fear_45\">Tan, Chee Khoon & Vasil, Raj (ed., 1984). ''Without Fear or Favour'', p. 45.

Several of these initiatives were led by Razaleigh. These initiatives were major corporate takeovers of foreign conglomerates and major industries which was previously owned by foreign shareholders respectively.\n\nDue to his excellent drive and contribution to the country's economy, and his strong economics and finance background, he was entrusted to manage the country's finance and was made the Finance Minister in 1976, Chairman of [[Asian Development Bank]] in 1976, IBRD ([[World Bank]]) and [[IMF]] in 1977, and [[Islamic Development Bank]] in 1978.\n\n===New Straits Times Press===\n\nThe [[New Straits Times Press]] (initially News Straits Times Press Sdn Bhd) was formed by the Directors of the Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, to acquire a majority shareholding in the company which was the largest mass-circulation news organ in the territories of East and West Malaysia.\n\nThe Malaysia operations of the Straits Times, the Sunday Times, the [[Malay Mail]], the Sunday Mail, [[Berita Harian]] and Berita Minggu were transferred to this new company. An agreement was reached in 1972 between the directors of the ''Straits Times group'' and ''Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah'' for the disposal of 80 per cent of the stock of the News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. for the Malaysian interest.<ref>The Straits Times 17 September 1972 page 1, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\n===Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad===\n\nOn 4 June 1965, ''\"Kongres Ekonomi Bumiputra\"'' (Bumiputra Economic Congress), sponsored by the Ministry of National and Rural Development, were held in Kuala Lumpur for 3 days to generate an interest among Malays and other local indigenous groups to participate in commerce and industry. Seven working committees were formed to achieve these objectives.<ref>The Straits Times 5 May 1965 page 18, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\n[[Tun Abdul Razak]], the then Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia announced that the Government had agreed to form a local Bank (\"Bank Bumiputra\") as recommended by the Economic Congress based on a majority of the 69 resolutions passed in the meeting.<ref>The Straits Times 8 May 1965 page 1, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> The Bank, with its initial capital to be provided by the Malaysian Government, would be established. The Bank's ownership would ultimately be sold to the public through shares. On 15 July 1965, Tun Abdul Razak announced the Government agreed to provide RM5 million as the initial capital for Bank Bumiputra.<ref>The Straits Times 15 July 1965 page 11, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> In an event presenting certificate to 80 students at \"Taman Latehan Wanita\", Lornie Road, Tun Abdul Razak reiterated that the main aim of the bank was to assist rural businessmen in the form of loans irrespective of religion.<ref>The Straits Times 4 September 1965 page 11, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\nBank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad was formally launched by Tun Abdul Razak on 1 October 1965 with authorised capital of RM25 million, instead of RM5 million announced earlier.<ref>The Straits Times 1 October 1965 page 1, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> The senior management was headed by Mohd Raslan bin Dato' Abdullah (managing director), former Accountant General of Government and Tengku Razaleigh (Executive Director). The other board members are S.O.K. Ubaidulla (President of United Chamber of Commerce), L.E Osman (a lawyer), K. Mushir Ariff (an incorporated valuer), Wan Yahya bin Haji Mohamad (a businessman from Terengganu), K.D. Eu (a company director, and Kuok Hock Nien (a company director). The general manager of the Bank was Wong Aun Pui, a prominent local banker with 20 years of experience and director of many rubber and palm oil companies.<ref>The Straits Times 10 March 1966 page 10, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\n=== Perbadanan Nasional Berhad (PERNAS) ===\n\nPERNAS (Perbadanan Nasional Berhad or National Corporation) was set up in November 1969 as a wholly owned government company to carry out the resolutions at the Second Bumiputera Economic Congress. Among the major shareholders included were Malaysia's Ministry of Finance, [[Bank Negara Malaysia]] (The Central Bank of Malaysia) and Bank Bumiputera Malaysia Berhad. Pernas was put under a solid footing under the chairmanship of Razaleigh (1970\u20131974) who had been the Minister of Finance from 1976 to 1984.<ref>The Developing Economies, Malaysia's Localization Policy and its impact of British owned Enterprises, Page 372, [[Institute of Developing Economies]], Japan</ref>\n\nWith the background of poor and very low participation of [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputeras]] in the private sector and industries at that time, PERNAS' principle were to:\n* enter undertakings which would bring high economic returns,\n* when enter into joint ventures, PERNAS was to be the majority stockholder with controlling interest over operations,\n* Bumiputeras were to be employed at all levels of operations and undertakings.<ref>The Developing Economies, Malaysia's Localization Policy and its impact of British owned Enterprises, Page 374, [[Institute of Developing Economies]], Japan</ref>\n\n8 subsidiaries were set up under PERNAS to achieve its objective. Malaysia National Insurance Berhad (MNI) was established in April 1970. There followed during 1971 Pernas Construction Sdn. Bhd., Pernas Engineering Sdn. Bhd., and Pernas Securities Sdn. Bhd. Then came Pernas Mining Sdn. Bhd (1973) and Pernas Edar Sdn Bhd (1974).\n\nRazaleigh was in the thick of what became known as the Haw Par imbroglio of the mid-1970s, working with the Singapore-based Haw Par Brothers International Ltd, then an offshoot of the empire of British wheeler-dealer Jim Slater, to acquire control of London Tin Company, the British-controlled tin conglomerate, and the [[Sime Darby]] plantations conglomerate.<ref>The Straits Times 2 January 1976 page 5, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> This was to be achieved through a complex series of transactions by which PERNAS would end up as the largest shareholder of both. It failed when Singapore accused Haw Par of financial irregularities and later jailed a senior executive and the head, Donald Watson, fled to Ireland.\n\nBut it proved a short-lived setback for Razaleigh. Within two years, a share and proxy battle orchestrated by merchant bank Rothschild \u2013 which was also a part owner of Bumiputera Merchant Bankers \u2013 brought Sime Darby under Malaysian control and its headquarters shifted to Kuala Lumpur. Control of London Tin Company was acquired the same year. In another coup in 1979, Malaysian money made a \"dawn raid\" on British plantation giant, Kumpulan Guthrie Bhd, which wrenched the company from British control; most of the other British owned plantations soon followed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1113&Itemid=31|title=A Onetime Political Star Returns to Malaysia's Stage|date= 24 March 2008|publisher=asiasentinel.com}}</ref>\n\nAmong the major corporate takeover exercise and formation of new businesses during Razaleigh's stewardship as Pernas chairman were\n* Insurance \u2013 [[Malaysia National Insurance]] Bhd,\n* Banking \u2013 [[Maybank]] Bhd,\n* Mining \u2013 the then-largest tin mining company in the world, London Tin Company, which was later renamed [[MMC Corporation Berhad]].\n* Palm Oil and Rubber Producer \u2013 [[Sime Darby]], [[Guthrie (company)|Guthrie]] Berhad, [[Highlands & Lowlands Berhad]].\n\n====Malaysia's first trade delegation to China====\n\n[[File:TRH_Pernas_Meeting_China.jpg|left|thumb|Tengku Razaleigh: Pernas Meeting with Chinese Delegation. Also present was Tun Razak and [[Ong Kee Hui]].]]\nIn 1971, Razaleigh's led trade delegation went to China to initiate a prospect of initiating a business relationship.<ref>The Political Economy of Malaysia's Trade Relation with China, John Wong, Page 9, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies</ref> During the visit to China, Razaleigh managed to meet the then China's Premier [[Zhou En Lai]]. Total trade with China stood at a mere RM105.6 million in 1971, but ballooned to RM1.6 billion in 1980. Since then the contact between the two countries has been on the increase as evidenced by the number of visits of trade, medical and sports delegations to China.\n\n=== Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS)===\n\nOn 6 September 1974, Malaysia's then prime minister, Tun Abdul Razak, announced the appointment of Razaleigh as chairman and Chief Executive of [[PETRONAS]] (Petroliam Nasional Berhad). Tun Razak said:'' \"From among the new blood, I intended to bring Tengku Razaleigh into the Cabinet. However, I have an important job for him, a job as important as that of a Cabinet Minister. I have decided to appoint him as chairman and Chief Executive of PETRONAS, which is equivalent to being a Cabinet Minister.\"''.<ref>The Straits Times 7 September 1974 page 8, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> Subsequently, Razaleigh had to relinquish his job as Chairman of PERNAS which he held from 1970, but retained the chairmanship of Bank Bumiputra.[[File:TRH_Petronas_Delegation_Houston.jpg|right|thumb|Tengku Razaleigh accompanying Tun Razak in a Petronas Delegation to Houston]]\n\n=== Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) ===\n\nThe company was founded on 17 March 1978 based on an idea from Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, as an instrument of the Government's New Economic Policy to promote share ownership among the Bumiputera, and to develop opportunities for deserving Bumiputera professionals to participate in the creation and management of wealth.\n\nToday, PNB is a major investor in Bursa Malaysia, investing nearly 10% of the market capitalisation of the bourse, across most major Malaysian corporations and also actively contributing towards the nation\u2019s human capital development through scholarships and employment opportunities.\n\n===Setting up banking firms and other institutions===\n\nHe also set up \"Bank Pembangunan Malaysia\" and founded and established both Bank Islam and Syarikat Takaful, an insurance company run in accordance with Syariah principles.\n\nInstitute of Marketing Malaysia (IMM) was founded by Razaleigh in 1977 and he became the Institute's first Patron.\n\n===Malaysian & Asean Chamber of Commerce===\n\nRazaleigh was President of Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, President of Malaysian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and consequently the President of ASEAN Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  He played a major role in the strategic restructuring of the Malaysian economy.  The Malaysian Chamber of Commerce acknowledged his expertise in the petroleum business and once called him the \"Malaysian Oil Prince\".  In the 1975 Malaysian Chamber of Commerce resolution, Razaleigh was named \"Father of Malaysian Economic Development\".\n\n==1960s : The early years==\nAs the former president of the Malayan Students Union in London and secretary of the Malay Society in Britain, Razaleigh has entered into politics on 23 April 1962. He was unanimously elected as chairman of the Ulu Kelantan Division of UMNO at its annual meeting. He had returned to Malaya earlier that year to attend the funeral of his father.<ref>The Straits Times 24 April 1962 page 11, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = Perubahan besar dalam UMNO Kelantan|last = Hashim|first = Zakaria|date = 18 July 1962|work = |access-date = |via = |publisher = Straits Times|newspaper = Berita Harian|location = Singapore|page = Page 5|language = Malay}}</ref>\n\nTengku Razaleigh was part of the Malaya's delegation to the [[United Nation]] for 17th Session of the U.N. General Assembly in 1962. The leader of the delegation was Dato' Dr. Ismail bin Dato' Abdul Rahman, the then-Minister of Internal Security.<ref>The Straits Times, 10 September 1962, Page 5, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\nIn the [[1969 Malaysian general election|1969 general election]], Razaleigh won [[Kelantan State Legislative Assembly]] seat of Ulu Kelantan Barat. Him, being of royal blood has the right to use the combined title of 'Yang Berhormat' which is the equivalent to 'The Honourable' and 'Yang Mulia' which is equivalent to 'His Highness'.

Razaleigh's planning is reputed to have been the main reason the [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition, of which UMNO is a member, almost totally defeated the opposition Islamic party of [[PAS (political party)|PAS]] in the [[1978 Malaysian general election|1978 general election]] and the Kelantan state elections of the same year.<ref name=\"fear_45\"/>\n\n==1980s ==\nWhen [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] succeeded Hussein Onn as Prime Minister, he declared the election for the Deputy Presidency of UMNO \u2013 and thus by extension the Deputy Prime Ministership \u2013 was open; he would not support any candidate. Razaleigh joined the fray, and his main opposition was [[Musa Hitam]].<ref>Tan & Vasil, p. 42.</ref> Eventually, Musa won the election with 722 votes to Razaleigh's 517 votes, becoming the new Deputy President and Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>Tan & Vasil, p. 204.</ref> Razaleigh blamed himself for taking \"a rather passive stance\" and not having a campaign strategy.<ref>Tan & Vasil, p. 112.</ref>\n\nTengku Razaleigh challenged Dr. Mahathir in the [[1987 United Malays National Organisation leadership election|1987 UMNO leadership election]], which Dr. Mahathir managed to retain his party president position. However, UMNO was split into two separate entities as Tengku Razaleigh was left unsatisfied with the result.\n\nThe split forced the Malaysian court to declare UMNO as illegal. Shortly after the court ruling, Dr. Mahathir reestablished UMNO as UMNO Baru (New UMNO), though the new UMNO was badly weakened. Tengku Razaleigh at the same time went on his own path and found a new political party called [[Parti Melayu Semangat 46]] (S46) in 1989. The number 46 refers to the year UMNO was founded.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the [[1993 Malaysian constitutional crisis]], Razaleigh strongly opposed the amendment for Rulers to be tried at court and their legal immunity be stripped. However, his efforts failed to bear fruit as it did not gain enough support. In 1996, Tengku Razaleigh disbanded [[Semangat 46]] and rejoined UMNO.\n\n==2000s==\nIn 2004, he announced his interest for the UMNO top post yet again but failed to garner enough nominations to contest the presidency.\n\n==2010s==\nOn 22 July 2011, [[Angkatan Amanah Merdeka]] (Amanah), a Non-Government Organisation was launched by Razaleigh at Memorial Tunku Abdul Rahman to revive and restore the spirit of Merdeka among Malaysians.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/amanah-diketuai-ku-li-dilancar-jumaat-sandar-amanat-tunku/|title=Amanah diketuai Ku Li dilancar Jumaat, sandar amanat Tunku|publisher=The Malaysian Insider|date=20 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226081953/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/amanah-diketuai-ku-li-dilancar-jumaat-sandar-amanat-tunku/|archivedate=26 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The organisation is led by Razaleigh himself as the President, along with several other public figures and prominent activists.\n\nHe lost his wife, Nur Yvonne Abdullah, who died on June 5, 2015 due to multiple myeloma, a disease she had been suffering from for the previous year.

Upon completing his primary school education at SRK Lokos, Kiulu in 1970, he was determined to continue his education despite initial objections from his parents due to financial constraints.\n\nWith his own savings, he enrolled in SMK Kiulu for Bridge Class to Form Two. To support himself in school, he took up a manual job as a rubber tapper on weekends. He was also employed by a Chinese \u201ctowkay\u201d, a term for business owners, in Kiulu town, which at that time only had a row of shops. He then could save on food and rental.\n\nHe often speaks of his childhood fondly:\n{{quote|At the age of just 13, students from my village Lokos would walk to our secondary school in Kiulu every two weeks or so. We would depart at 6am from my village and arrive at our school at 6pm, carrying food supplies, mainly rice. As a young undergraduate from UPM, I would walk for four hours from Nabalu town to Lokos. Generally the people from my village are from poor families without a regular source of income as they survived on subsistence farming.}}\n\nAt the end of Form Two he was awarded a Boarding Scholarship from the Sabah State Government to further his studies in SMK Ranau in Form Three in 1974. With the good results he obtained in the Lower Certificate of Education (LCE) he was granted a Sabah State Government Scholarship to pursue Form Four at Setapak High School, Selangor, the year after.\n\nInspired by fellow schoolmates in this school, he initiated a student society in his village called KEPALOS, which formed student study groups and fundraised to finance their programmes. In 1976, Tangau passed his Malaysian Certificate of Education (MCE) with Grade One. With this he earned the same scholarship to do his Form Six at Sekolah Menengah Sains Selangor (SMSS) Cheras, a governmental fully residential school. At SMSSah, he was an active student leader and a debater for his school. Prior to his tertiary education while waiting for the results of his Higher School Certificate, he served as a temporary teacher at SMK Tamparuli, Sabah, for five months. He taught Integrated Science or Sains Paduan to Form One students.\n\nIn 1979, having successfully completed his Higher School Certificate, Tangau was accepted into University Pertanian Malaysia (UPM), Selangor, to do his Bachelor Degree in Forestry Science. He was an active student leader at university. He was the President of the Catholic Student Society for two terms from 1981 to 1982. He was also a keen observer of the political development of his birth state Sabah, and nationwide. He graduated in 1983 and soon after, he secured a job at the Sabah Forestry Development Authority (SAFODA) as a research officer on silviculture. In 1985 he was accepted as an individual participant to study forest management in various institutions in Japan under the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for four months. He had the opportunity to travel and stay in Tokyo, Kumamoto, Numata, Hokkaido and Tsukuba. Subsequently in 1990 he obtained a Masters in Development Management from Asian Institute of Management (AIM) in the Philippines.\n\nHe is married to Datuk (Datin Seri Panglima) Dr. Jaina Sintian, who is the founding Vice Chief of the UPKO Women Movement Chief (UPKO Wanita, later the Chief 2008 and retired in 2918 when the husband was elected officially as the President of UPKO. Together  they have five children - four daughters, and a son, who is also the youngest. The eldest is a twin daughters, a medical and nutrition graduates respectively.\n\n== Prior to politics ==\nShortly after graduating from UPM, Tangau was sent to Japan for a four-month training stint in various research institutions. Upon returning to Sabah in 1985 he assisted Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) as a backroom boy to form the new Sabah government. He joined the newly set up Institute for Development Studies (IDS) Sabah as a research associate, and served for nine years until 1994.\n\nWhen BN toppled PBS in 1994, Tangau assisted leaders who left the party to form Parti Demokratik Sabah (PDS). For the next five years Tangau served as the Chief Executive Officer at the Institute for Indigenous Economic Progress (INDEP) Sabah, a think-tank set established by PDS. The objective of INDEP was to engage Pasokmomogun community groups in Sabah in policymaking and assist UPKO leaders in decision-makings.\n\nTangau was appointed as Chairman of several federal agencies and state linked companies such as Sabah Cultural Board (LKNS, Forest Plantation Development Sdn. Bhd., Malaysian Timber Industrial Board (MTIB) and Asian Supply Sdn. Bhd.(ASB) Tangau was also on the board of Suria Capital Berhad, Sabah Energy Corporation Sdn. Bhd.\n\n== Political career ==\nIn the 1999 state elections in Sabah, 10 of the 12 PDS candidates who contested were defeated. Due to this devastating defeat Tangau was requested by the party leadership to contest in the 1999 parliamentary general election, effectively thrusting him from backroom boy to mainstream politics.\n\nTangau was elected as the Member of Parliament for Tuaran for the first time in November 1999 and again in 2004. He did not contest in the 12th Malaysian Parliament to make way for then UPKO deputy president Datuk Wilfred Bumburing to contest.\n\nIn the 13th General Elections held in 2013 he was once again elected as the Member of Parliament for Tuaran and won by a majority of over 5,000 votes.\n\nTangau has been involved in UPKO since the party\u2019s early days. Shortly after he was first elected as an MP he became the Information Chief. He was then appointed the secretary general in 2002.\n\nIn 2012 the deputy president post fell vacant when Datuk Wilfred Bumburing quit UPKO to join the Opposition Pakatan Rakyat coalition. Tangau was elected the deputy president in October 2013, beating Datuk Dr Ewon Ebin, UPKO vice-president, with a slim majority.\n\nIn March 2014 the founding president Tan Sri Bernard Dompok stepped down, nearly 10 months after he lost the Penampang parliamentary seat in the last general election. Since then Tangau has been serving as the Acting President of UPKO until he won the president post uncontested at the party triennial general meetings on 24 September 2018.<ref name=upko/>\n\n== Ministerial career ==\nPrime Minister Datuk Seri [[Najib Razak]] announced a new Cabinet line-up on 28 July 2015, involving the appointment of seven new ministers and nine deputy ministers.

He actively promoted innovation as a way of life. Practical problems in life, especially those economic challenges should be properly identified and then innovate to resolved them using science and technologies.

It is the principal settlement of the [[civil parish]] of [[Dartmoor Forest]].\n\nThe village has its origins in 1785, when [[Thomas Tyrwhitt (MP)|Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt]], Secretary to the [[Prince of Wales]], leased a large area of [[moorland]] from the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] estate, hoping to convert it into good farmland. He encouraged people to live in the area and suggested that a prison be built there. He called the settlement Princetown after the Prince of Wales.\n\nPrincetown is the site of [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor Prison]].

It is also the largest settlement located on the high moor. The [[Princetown Railway]], closed in 1956, was also the highest railway line in England: its Princetown terminus was also 1,430&nbsp;feet above sea level.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1780, a farm was reclaimed on the site of an ancient tenement near the Two Bridges, and in 1785, [[Thomas Tyrwhitt (MP)|Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt]] set about improving the moor at a place which he named [[Tor Royal]] (present day Tor Royal Farm), about {{convert|1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} south-east of Princetown.<ref name=PEV /> The Plume of Feathers Inn also bears this date on its sign. He made an estate and built a house in 1798. Later the road from [[Tavistock]] to Princetown was built, as well as the other roads that now cross the moor.\n\n[[File:1900 Princetown, Prison Gate.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of prisoners on a work party at [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor Prison]] about 1900]]\nHe also proposed that a prison be built on Dartmoor to house the thousands of captives of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the later [[War of 1812]], who had become too numerous to lodge in the prisons and prison-ships at [[Plymouth]]. The site was given by the [[Prince of Wales]], who held the lands of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] to which the whole moor belonged. This is why the settlement is named Princetown. [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor Prison]] was built in 1806 at a cost of \u00a3130,000. At one time it had a capacity of between 7,000 and 9,000 prisoners, but its current capacity is only 640.<ref>http://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder/dartmoor</ref>\n\nA small town grew up near the prison. Two large inns were built during the war - the current Prince of Wales and the former Devil's Elbow / Railway Inn. Many of the prisoners had [[prize money]] to come from their own country; many others made their own money in their hammocks at night, even forging [[Bank of England]] and local bank notes, which they passed off in the great daily market held in the prison. With the closing of the prison in 1816, the town almost collapsed, but the completion of the [[Princetown Railway]] in 1823 brought back many people to the granite quarries. The prison remained derelict until 1851, when it was reopened for prisoners serving long sentences. It has since been considerably extended<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskins|first=William George|authorlink=W. G.

It was extended during the 1970s and remained in use until closure in 2001, largely because very few prison officers lived in Princetown by that date, but commuted in from [[Plymouth]] or [[Tavistock]] in the main.<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV117271&resourceID=104</ref>\n\nThe terrace of houses now called Moor Crescent was constructed in 1912 as housing for prison officers of fairly senior rank, in which role it served until the 1980s. After falling into near-derelict condition, it was renovated and is now private housing.<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV117268&resourceID=104</ref> Hessary Terrace, which backs onto Moor Crescent, was also constructed as housing for prison officers,<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV114803&resourceID=104</ref> as was Heather Terrace.<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV117267&resourceID=104</ref>\n\nThere is a sports field, now used by Princetown Football Club and known as Legend Park,<ref>http://www.fchd.info/grounds/princetown.htm</ref> which formerly belonged to the prison. The sports field and pavilion (now Princetown Pavilion Youth Club) date from the 1890s and were constructed for use by the prison warders. A tennis pavilion was laid out in the 1920s as a base for the tennis court for officers and their families. It was demolished in the 1960s due to its poor state. The bowling green and pavilion were built around the turn of the century and visiting teams of prison staff played matches on many occasions. This was also demolished in the 1960s.<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV51416&resourceID=104</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Church St Michael Princetown.jpg|thumb|right|Church of St Michael, Princetown]]\nThe village is located on the B3212 road between [[Yelverton, Devon|Yelverton]] and [[Two Bridges, Devon|Two Bridges]] and is surrounded by moorland. Several footpaths across the moor pass through the village, including one leading west to Sampford Spiney and one leading south to Nun's Cross and Erme Head.\n\nTor Royal Lane is a dead end road which leads down from the village to the site of the disused [[Whiteworks]] tin mine, about 2 miles or 3&nbsp;km to the south-east, which overlooks [[Fox Tor]] Mires, the presumed site of the Grimpen Mire to be found in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s tale ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]].'' Conan Doyle stayed at the former Duchy Hotel whilst writing and researching the story with his friend, [[Bertram Fletcher Robinson]]. The hotel has long since closed and the building now houses the National Park Visitor Centre which is an all-weather centre and activity hub, with interactive displays, films, exhibitions and a children's discovery area.\n\nOther points of interest in the village include the prison museum which was formerly the prison dairy <ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV104777&resourceID=104and</ref> and behind the prison, two cemeteries - one for French prisoners of war and the other for American prisoners of war who died in the prison when it was a war depot during the Napoleonic War in the 19th century. The cemetery around the Church of St Michael and All Angels includes the graves of convicts who died during their incarceration in the prison. The [[Church of St Michael, Princetown|Church of St Michael]] has the distinction of being the only one in England constructed by POWs<ref>https://www.visitchurches.org.uk/visit/church-listing/st-michael-and-all-angels-princetown.html</ref> and is dedicated, as are many churches in high locations,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=R2oGDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=churches+dedicated+t+ost+michael+in+high+locations#v=onepage&q=churches%20dedicated%20t%20ost%20michael%20in%20high%20locations&f=false | title=Heaven and Earth in Anglo-Saxon England: Theology and Society in an Age of Faith| isbn=9781317123071| last1=Forbes| first1=Helen Foxhall| date=22 April 2016}}</ref> to St. Michael.

In 2016 the official population estimate was 1447, with a further 640 inmates of the prison. Most people living in Princetown commute to work in [[Plymouth]] or [[Tavistock]], but with the expansion of the brewery a few more jobs have been created locally. The population is projected to keep increasing in the future<ref>http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/43440/pl_dnp-_population-projection-2010.pdf</ref> mainly due to the improved amenities within the village itself and the relatively high percentage of young people living there.<ref>http://www.devon.gov.uk/dnpbaselineprofile.pdf</ref> \nPrincetown is undergoing significant regeneration and expansion, with new private housing built at several sites in the village and a football pitch with car parking built behind the Community Centre. High Moorland Visitor Centre has been renamed as the National Park Visitor Centre, and the area outside the centre altered to include artwork and new seating areas.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Plume of Feathers Pub Princetown.jpg|thumb|right|Plume of Feathers public house]]\nIn terms of tourism, Princetown is a popular destination and hub for people traversing the moors, and the sight of large groups of hikers and walkers is especially common during the summer months. A bunkhouse, bed and breakfast and camping facilities are available in the village and there are also a handful of local shops. The Dartmoor Ultra Marathon takes place annually,<ref>http://www.dartmoorhighground.com/dartmoor-ultra-50</ref> as does the charity Tour de Moor cycle race.<ref>https://www.stlukes-hospice.org.uk/tourdemoor/</ref>\n\nPrincetown has a brewery <ref>https://www.dartmoorbrewery.co.uk/</ref> producing the appropriately named Jail Ale, Legend, Dartmoor [[India Pale Ale|IPA]], Dartmoor Gold, Dartmoor Best, Dragon's Breath and Three Hares. This used to be housed in the Prince of Wales pub, but now occupies a modern purpose-built building on the edge of the village, close to the former railway. The other pub is the Plume of Feathers (the Railway Inn \u2013 \"The Devils Elbow\" \u2013 closed as a pub in 2009).

It is the principal settlement of the [[civil parish]] of [[Dartmoor Forest]].\n\nThe village has its origins in 1785, when [[Thomas Tyrwhitt (MP)|Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt]], Secretary to the [[Prince of Wales]], leased a large area of [[moorland]] from the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] estate, hoping to convert it into good farmland. He encouraged people to live in the area and suggested that a prison be built there. He called the settlement Princetown after the Prince of Wales.\n\nPrincetown is the site of [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor Prison]].

It is also the largest settlement located on the high moor. The [[Princetown Railway]], closed in 1956, was also the highest railway line in England: its Princetown terminus was also 1,430&nbsp;feet above sea level.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1780, a farm was reclaimed on the site of an ancient tenement near the Two Bridges, and in 1785, [[Thomas Tyrwhitt (MP)|Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt]] set about improving the moor at a place which he named [[Tor Royal]] (present day Tor Royal Farm), about {{convert|1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} south-east of Princetown.<ref name=PEV /> The Plume of Feathers Inn also bears this date on its sign. He made an estate and built a house in 1798. Later the road from [[Tavistock]] to Princetown was built, as well as the other roads that now cross the moor.\n\n[[File:1900 Princetown, Prison Gate.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of prisoners on a work party at [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor Prison]] about 1900]]\nHe also proposed that a prison be built on Dartmoor to house the thousands of captives of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the later [[War of 1812]], who had become too numerous to lodge in the prisons and prison-ships at [[Plymouth]]. The site was given by the [[Prince of Wales]], who held the lands of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] to which the whole moor belonged. This is why the settlement is named Princetown. [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor Prison]] was built in 1806 at a cost of \u00a3130,000. At one time it had a capacity of between 7,000 and 9,000 prisoners, but its current capacity is only 640.<ref>http://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder/dartmoor</ref>\n\nA small town grew up near the prison. Two large inns were built during the war - the current Prince of Wales and the former Devil's Elbow / Railway Inn. Many of the prisoners had [[prize money]] to come from their own country; many others made their own money in their hammocks at night, even forging [[Bank of England]] and local bank notes, which they passed off in the great daily market held in the prison. With the closing of the prison in 1816, the town almost collapsed, but the completion of the [[Princetown Railway]] in 1823 brought back many people to the granite quarries. The prison remained derelict until 1851, when it was reopened for prisoners serving long sentences. It has since been considerably extended<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskins|first=William George|authorlink=W. G.

It was extended during the 1970s and remained in use until closure in 2001, largely because very few prison officers lived in Princetown by that date, but commuted in from [[Plymouth]] or [[Tavistock]] in the main.<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV117271&resourceID=104</ref>\n\nThe terrace of houses now called Moor Crescent was constructed in 1912 as housing for prison officers of fairly senior rank, in which role it served until the 1980s. After falling into near-derelict condition, it was renovated and is now private housing.<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV117268&resourceID=104</ref> Hessary Terrace, which backs onto Moor Crescent, was also constructed as housing for prison officers,<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV114803&resourceID=104</ref> as was Heather Terrace.<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV117267&resourceID=104</ref>\n\nThere is a sports field, now used by Princetown Football Club and known as Legend Park,<ref>http://www.fchd.info/grounds/princetown.htm</ref> which formerly belonged to the prison. The sports field and pavilion (now Princetown Pavilion Youth Club) date from the 1890s and were constructed for use by the prison warders. A tennis pavilion was laid out in the 1920s as a base for the tennis court for officers and their families. It was demolished in the 1960s due to its poor state. The bowling green and pavilion were built around the turn of the century and visiting teams of prison staff played matches on many occasions. This was also demolished in the 1960s.<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV51416&resourceID=104</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Church St Michael Princetown.jpg|thumb|right|Church of St Michael, Princetown]]\nThe village is located on the B3212 road between [[Yelverton, Devon|Yelverton]] and [[Two Bridges, Devon|Two Bridges]] and is surrounded by moorland. Several footpaths across the moor pass through the village, including one leading west to Sampford Spiney and one leading south to Nun's Cross and Erme Head.\n\nTor Royal Lane is a dead end road which leads down from the village to the site of the disused [[Whiteworks]] tin mine, about 2 miles or 3&nbsp;km to the south-east, which overlooks [[Fox Tor]] Mires, the presumed site of the Grimpen Mire to be found in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s tale ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]].'' Conan Doyle stayed at the former Duchy Hotel whilst writing and researching the story with his friend, [[Bertram Fletcher Robinson]]. The hotel has long since closed and the building now houses the National Park Visitor Centre which is an all-weather centre and activity hub, with interactive displays, films, exhibitions and a children's discovery area.\n\nOther points of interest in the village include the prison museum which was formerly the prison dairy <ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV104777&resourceID=104and</ref> and behind the prison, two cemeteries - one for French prisoners of war and the other for American prisoners of war who died in the prison when it was a war depot during the Napoleonic War in the 19th century. The cemetery around the Church of St Michael and All Angels includes the graves of convicts who died during their incarceration in the prison. The [[Church of St Michael, Princetown|Church of St Michael]] has the distinction of being the only one in England constructed by POWs<ref>https://www.visitchurches.org.uk/visit/church-listing/st-michael-and-all-angels-princetown.html</ref> and is dedicated, as are many churches in high locations,<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=R2oGDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=churches+dedicated+t+ost+michael+in+high+locations#v=onepage&q=churches%20dedicated%20t%20ost%20michael%20in%20high%20locations&f=false | title=Heaven and Earth in Anglo-Saxon England: Theology and Society in an Age of Faith| isbn=9781317123071| last1=Forbes| first1=Helen Foxhall| date=22 April 2016}}</ref> to St. Michael. It was taken out of use due to structural problems and damp and is now maintained by the [[Churches Conservation Trust]], although the building has been stabilised and made safe. The United Church of Princetown can be found at the other end of the village.<ref>https://www.achurchnearyou.com/church/8846/</ref>\n\nThe village is overlooked from the north-west by [[North Hessary Tor]] upon which is a tall [[North Hessary Tor transmitting station|transmitting mast]] that provides a useful guide point for walkers from miles around.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.picturetheuk.com/uk-tourism/things-to-do/north-hessary-tor-and-radio-tv-station-devon-2687.html \n|title=North Hessary Tor and Radio/TV Station, Devon\n|publisher=PictureTheUK\n|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Demography ==\nThe village is mainly made up of white British people living in a mix of social and private housing. There are currently 74 children enrolled at the primary school which was rated 'Requires Improvement' by Ofsted in 2017.<ref>https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/21/113261</ref> The school itself was constructed in 1874 for the children of prison officers.<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV51420&resourceID=104</ref> A further 17 children attend the pre-school, which is contained within the Community Centre in its own purpose-built wing. In 2016 the official population estimate was 1447, with a further 640 inmates of the prison. Most people living in Princetown commute to work in [[Plymouth]] or [[Tavistock]], but with the expansion of the brewery a few more jobs have been created locally. The population is projected to keep increasing in the future<ref>http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/43440/pl_dnp-_population-projection-2010.pdf</ref> mainly due to the improved amenities within the village itself and the relatively high percentage of young people living there.<ref>http://www.devon.gov.uk/dnpbaselineprofile.pdf</ref> \nPrincetown is undergoing significant regeneration and expansion, with new private housing built at several sites in the village and a football pitch with car parking built behind the Community Centre. High Moorland Visitor Centre has been renamed as the National Park Visitor Centre, and the area outside the centre altered to include artwork and new seating areas.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Plume of Feathers Pub Princetown.jpg|thumb|right|Plume of Feathers public house]]\nIn terms of tourism, Princetown is a popular destination and hub for people traversing the moors, and the sight of large groups of hikers and walkers is especially common during the summer months. A bunkhouse, bed and breakfast and camping facilities are available in the village and there are also a handful of local shops. The Dartmoor Ultra Marathon takes place annually,<ref>http://www.dartmoorhighground.com/dartmoor-ultra-50</ref> as does the charity Tour de Moor cycle race.<ref>https://www.stlukes-hospice.org.uk/tourdemoor/</ref>\n\nPrincetown has a brewery <ref>https://www.dartmoorbrewery.co.uk/</ref> producing the appropriately named Jail Ale, Legend, Dartmoor [[India Pale Ale|IPA]], Dartmoor Gold, Dartmoor Best, Dragon's Breath and Three Hares. This used to be housed in the Prince of Wales pub, but now occupies a modern purpose-built building on the edge of the village, close to the former railway. The other pub is the Plume of Feathers (the Railway Inn \u2013 \"The Devils Elbow\" \u2013 closed as a pub in 2009). In April 2017 the go-ahead was given for the construction of a whisky distillery,<ref>https://princetowndistillery.com/</ref> which invoked controversy due to the destruction of buildings that this would entail.<ref>http://www.tavistock-today.co.uk/article.cfm?id=420292&headline=Princetown%20whisky%20distillery%20plans%20given%20the%20go-ahead%20by%20Dartmoor%20National%20Park&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2017</ref> These are the 'Pocket Power Station' (the world's first unmanned power station)<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV117473&resourceID=104</ref> and the 'Pressed Men Building<ref>https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV117463&resourceID=104</ref>'.<ref>http://www.tavistock-today.co.uk/article.cfm?id=418705&headline=Princetown%20distillery%20plan%20hits%20heritage%20hurdle&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2017</ref> As of November 2019, construction of the building is in progress.\n\nThere are also two caf\u00e9s, one of which is in the former police station, the other of which is the Fox Tor cafe.\n\nFour businesses now operate from Tavistock Road, opposite the visitor centre and adjacent to Duchy Square.\n\nIce Warrior performs expedition training and supplies outdoor gear,<ref>http://www.ice-warrior.com</ref> Dewerstone is a coffee and clothing shop <ref>http://www.dewerstone.com</ref> and Hunt The Moon is a screen printing supplies and t-shirt printing shop.<ref>https://huntthemoon.co.uk/</ref>\n\nThe unit next to Hunt The Moon houses the village charity shop, which supports both the Community Centre and other local causes.<ref>https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?subid=0&regid=1143216</ref>\n\nIn recent years Princetown has seen the opening of both the Princetown Centre for Creativity in Duchy Square, on the site of the former village supermarket, which closed in 2011 but has now re-opened as the Duchy Square Centre, housing business tenants,<ref>http://www.tavistock-today.co.uk/article.cfm?id=414407&headline=New%20lease%20of%20life%20for%20Duchy%20Square%20Centre%20in%20Princetown&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2016</ref> and a new village community centre opened in 2008, which also houses a GP surgery,<ref>https://www.nhs.uk/Services/GP/Overview/DefaultView.aspx?id=44230</ref> library<ref>https://www.devonlibraries.org.uk/web/arena/princetownlibrary</ref> and pre-school.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nPrincetown, like the rest of Dartmoor, experiences colder and wetter weather than most of Devon, especially because of its high altitude.
