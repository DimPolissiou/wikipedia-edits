They are differentiated from another part of the community, known in this context as the [[Northists]]. Today there are about 300,000 Knanaya in India and elsewhere.{{sfn|Fahlbusch|2008|p=286}}\n\nThe origins of the division of the Saint Thomas Christians into Northist and Southist groups are unclear. Various traditions trace it back to the arrival of the Syrian merchant [[Thomas of Cana]] (Kn\u0101i Thoma) who led a migration of endogamous [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] [[Syriac Christians]] (possibly{{Weasel inline|date=April 2020}} of [[Jewish]] origin) to India in the 4th or 8th century. The Knanaya claim descent from Thomas of Cana and those who came with him. The ethnic division between the Knanaya and other St. Thomas Christians was present by the time of the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonization]] in the 16th century and was noted throughout the [[Colonial India|European colonial era]].\n\nToday, the majority of Knanaya are members of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] ([[Eastern Catholic]]) and the [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church|Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church]] ([[Oriental Orthodox]]). They became increasingly prominent in Kerala in the late 19th century. Many Knanaya migrated away during the 20th and 21st centuries, largely westward, forming communities in non-Malayalam speaking areas, with a large expatriate community currently living in Houston, Texas and [[Chicago]], Illinois, United States.\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Thomas of Cana.jpg|thumb|Thomas of Cana]]\nThe term ''Kn\u0101n\u0101ya'' derives from the name [[Thomas of Cana|Kn\u0101i Thoma]] ([[Anglicisation|anglicized]] as Thomas of Cana), an important figure in the Saint Thomas Christian tradition.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}} The term is derived from Thomas' [[Syriac language|Syriac]] adjectival epithet Kn\u0101'n\u0101ya in reference to the land of [[Canaan]] and is defined as meaning \"Those of Canaan\".{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=85}} The earliest written record of the term used as a designation of the community dates to the 1800s, however notations of the term itself are found in Knanaya folk songs such as the song of the erection of Kallisserry Church in 1580.{{sfn|Luke|1911|p=72}}{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=85}}  Members of the Knanaya Community are also generally called Kn\u0101i or Kn\u0101, in reference to Thomas. Many Knanaya families, especially those of the [[Kaduthuruthy]] region maintain the surname Kin\u0101n, a derivative of Thomas\u2019 epithet. Woman of these families preserve gendered forms of the term, examples of this being Kin\u0101ti Anna, Kin\u0101ti Mariam, etc.{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=1}}\n\nThe ultimate derivation of Thomas' English epithet ''Cana'' is not clear: it may refer to the town of [[Cana]], which is mentioned in the [[Bible]], or it may instead refer to the land of [[Canaan]].{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}}Alternately, it may be a corruption of a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] term for merchant (''Kn\u0101yil'' in Malayalam).{{sfn|Neill|2004|p=42}} However, scholar Richard M. Swiderski states that none of these etymologies are entirely sound.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}} Knanaya priest and scholar Jacob Kollaparambil argues that the \"Cana\" form is a corruption introduced by European scholars in the 18th century based on the [[Malayalam]] form ''Kn\u0101y'' and its variants (Kn\u0101i, Kin\u0101n, Kn\u0101yi) found in the folk tradition of the Knanaya and the common parlance and literature of the people of Malabar.{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|pp=1-20}} This may be a reference to the Christian community of Kynai, in B\u00e9t Aramay\u00e9 in Persia, a historical center of Syriac Christianity.{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=1}} ''Knanaya'' is the spelling preferred by community members; other less common spellings include ''Cananites'' and ''Cnanites''.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nThe Knanaya are also known as ''Tekkumbhagar'' in Malayalam; this is generally translated into English as \"Southist\", or sometimes \"Southerner\" or \"Suddhist\". This is in reference to the historically significant geographical division between them and other Saint Thomas Christians, who are known as ''Vadakumbhagar'' or Northists in this context.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=73}}\n\n===Titles===\nHistorically the Knanaya held the title of being the \"protectors of seventeen castes\", an authority given to them by the [[Cheraman Perumal]] according to folk tradition. This title which was reflective of the historical high caste status of the Knanaya, is to this day exhibited during Knanaya marriage ceremonies when individuals taking part in the rituals ask permission before fulfilling their designated role. A prominent example of this is seen during the \"Chandam Charthal\" or grooms beautification ceremony, in which the barber petitions the assembly three times with the following request: \"I ask the gentlemen here who have superiority over 17 castes, may I shave the bridegroom?\".{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=470}}\n\nThe Knanaya were also known as ''Ancharapallikar'' or the \"Owners of Five and a Half churches\" a title reflective of the five churches owned by the Southist Community before the [[Synod of Diamper]] in 1599. The churches are listed as the following: Udayamperoor, Kaduthuruthy, Kottayam, Chunkom, and Kallissery. The \"half church\" is a reference to the half privilege and share the Knanaya held in other churches they co-owned with the Northist St. Thomas Christians, usually in areas where not many Knanaya lived.{{sfn|Vellian|2001|p=2}}\n\n==History==\n===Origins and traditions===\n[[File:Thomas of Cana and the Knanaya Depart for India.jpg|thumb|Thomas of Cana and the Knanaya Depart for India]]\nIt is not clear how the division of the Saint Thomas Christians into Southern and Northern groups originated. The earliest extensive written evidence for the split dates to the 16th century.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=77}} The St. Thomas Christian tradition defines the division as being both geographical and ethnic, expressing that the Native St. Thomas Christians initially resided on the north side of the [[Chera Dynasty|Chera Empire's]] capitol city of Cranganore while the Middle Eastern migrant Knanaya arrived and settled on the south side, which subsequently led to the designation Northist and Southist.{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}} Directional divisions within communities are common in Kerala, including among Hindu groups.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=76\u201380}}{{sfn|Coward|1993|p=19}} A similar north\u2013south division is found among the [[Nairs]], and it historically appears to have been in place in the early [[Brahmin]] settlements in the area. The Saint Thomas Christians may have taken this trait from the Brahmins.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=73\u201374}} \n\n====Thomas of Cana\u2019s Expedition====\nThe historical rationale for the division between the majority St. Thomas Christians and minority Knanaya traces the divide to the figure of Thomas of Cana, a Syrian merchant who led a group of 72 [[Jewish Christians|Jewish-Christian]] immigrant families, a bishop named Uraha Mar Yausef, and clergymen from [[Mesopotamia]] to settle in  [[Cranganore]], [[India]] in the 4th century (some sources place these events as late as the 9th century).{{sfn|Baum & Winkler|2003|p=53}}{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|pp=60}}{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-26}} This story may reflect a historical migration of East Syrian Christians to India around this time, which established the region's relationship with the [[Church of the East]].{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=42\u201343}} In the commonly accepted accounts of this history, the Knanaya are the descendants of Thomas of Cana and his followers, while the Northists descend from the local Christian body which had been converted by [[Thomas the Apostle]] centuries earlier.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=74\u201376}}{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}} Elements of the Thomas of Cana story feature in ancient songs as well as the [[Thomas of Cana copper plates]] awarded to his followers by a local Hindu ruler.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|pp=460-461}}{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-26}}{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|p=52}} These plates are said to have granted Thomas\u2019 followers 72 social, economic, and religious rights from [[Cheraman Perumal]], the [[Chera]] king.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=63\u201364}} The plates were present in Kerala during the time of the Portuguese colonization in the early 17th century, but were lost during Portuguese rule.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=65\u201366}} The Knanaya invoke the plates as evidence of their descent from Thomas of Cana's mission.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=66\u201367}} This version of the Thomas of Cana narrative is the accepted history among both Knanaya and Northist scholars alike as well as scholarship in general.{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Thodathil|2001|pp=111\u2013112}}\n[[File:Thomas of Cana receives privileges from Cheruman Perumal.jpg|thumb|Thomas of Cana Receives Privileges from Cheraman Perumal]]\n====Two Wives Legend====\nIn many other variants recorded during the colonial era, Thomas of Cana had two wives or partners, one of them being the ancestor of the endogamous Southists, and the other one being the ancestor of the Northist.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=76\u201380}}{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}} A number of traditions and stories have emerged to explain the status of either wife,{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=73\u201392}} and both Southists and Northists historically used variants of these traditions to claim superiority for their group.{{sfn|Baum & Winkler|2003|p=53}}\nThese variants are considered apocryphal and are not the accepted tradition among contemporary Northist and Southist scholars who generally believe them to be the consequence of rivalry between the St. Thomas Christians and Knanaya.{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}} In some of these variants, the Southists' ancestor was Thomas\u2019 Syrian wife, while the Northists' was an indigenous [[Nair]] woman who became his second wife or concubine, implying that the Southists are Thomas\u2019 true heirs.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=76\u201377}} In other variants, both wives were Kerala natives, while the Southists' forebearer was from a higher caste.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=77\u201378}} More recent versions of this story downplay the importance of either wife's status, focusing instead on their descendants' marriage practices: the Northists intermarried with the natives, while the Knanaya enforced strict endogamy, maintaining a \"pure\" lineage.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nSome Northists also maintain versions of the Thomas of Cana story that counter the Knanayas' assertions. In the Northist versions, both Northists and Southists are descended from marriages between Thoma's party and indigenous Christians, but the Knanaya are descended from Syrian servants who married \"low caste\" Keralans; the Knanayas' endogamy and \"purity\" are thus borne out of their exclusion by the higher class Northists. These variants frequently trace Knanaya descent back to a ''dobi'' (washerwoman); in some versions of this story, she became Thoma's concubine, while in other she married a lower-caste [[Maaran]] boy.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=80\u201382}} This assertion is based on the 1676 Portuguese document \"M.S Sloane 2748-A\", a likely forgery attributed to the [[Discalced Carmelites|Carmelite]] priest Father Mathew.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=36}}\n\nHistorian of medieval India and Northist priest Pius Malekandathil argues that the two-wives legend was simply a creation of rivalry between the Middle Eastern migrant Knanaya and the Native St. Thomas Christians. Malekandathil expresses that the story originated in the medieval era due to the two ethnic groups of Christians asserting socioeconomic dominance over the other. Furthermore,  Malekandathil notes that the two-wives legend is not the accepted tradition among the people of Kerala but instead that the indigenous Saint Thomas Christians got the appellation \"Northists\" because they were initially located on the northern part of the city of Cranganore, while the migrant Knanaya under the leadership of Thomas of Cana were given the southern side of the city which led to the generic title of \"Southists\".{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n====Jewish-Christian Claim====\nThe Knanaya strongly attest that the Syriac Christian migrants who arrived with Thomas of Cana were Jewish-Christians (endogamous Jews who converted to Syriac Christianity). This ideal is established from cultural aspects of the community such as Knanaya folk songs first written on palm-leave manuscripts in the 17th century from which the Knanaya disseminate much of their history and heritage. Many of the historical songs allude to the migrants being of Jewish descent such as the song ''Nallor Oraslem'' (The Good Jerusalem) which states the migrants prayed at the tomb of the [[Ezra|Jewish Prophet Ezra]] before departing to India. A plethora of Jewish scholars such as Dr. P.M. Jussay, Dr. Nathan Katz, Dr. Shalva Weil, and Dr. Ohpira Gamliel have all noted that the Knanaya maintain cultural similarities to Jewish communities, a factor which could allude to the communities claimed Jewish origins.{{sfn|Weil|1982|pp=175-196}}{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118-128}}{{sfn|Gamliel|2009|pp=90}} Other scholars entirely accept the Jewish-Christian claim of the Knanaya such as Oxford historian Dr. Robert Eric Frykenberg.{{sfn|Frykenberg|2010|pp=109}}\n\nIn 1939, the Knanaya politician and author Joseph Chazhikaden published a book on the community, ''Tekkumbhagasamudayam Charitram'', in which he included some aspects of the communities Jewish claim. Chazhikaden built upon the Thomas of Cana tradition but asserted that Thomas' followers originated in [[Judea]]. According to Chazhikaden, the group converted to Christianity while maintaining their distinct culture and identity.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=95\u201396}} Eventually, they were forced out of their homeland and moved to [[Cranganore]], where they were welcomed by the ruler Cheraman Perumal and lived near, but maintained their separateness from, the indigenous \"Northist\" Saint Thomas Christians. Sociologist Richard Swiderski believes that the legend was \"conceived and promulgated\" by Chazhikaden himself.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=88}} Many modern Knanaya accept the account as factual, while others reject it. As with other Knanaya origin traditions, some Northists dispute and condemn it.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=89}}\n\n===Late Medieval Era===\nThe first written evidence of a Knanaya individual dates to the year 1301, with the writings of Zacharias the deacon of St. Kuriakose Church, Cranganore.{{sfn|Kollamparambil|2012|p=48}} Historically the Knanaya had a township and three churches namely of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas the Apostle]], [[Cyricus and Julitta|Saint Kuriakose]], and [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] in the southern portion of the Chera Empire's capital city of Cranganore. According to tradition the three churches were built by Thomas of Cana when the community arrived to India.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=22}} Zacharias was the 14 year old deacon of St. Kuriakose Church as well as the scribe and pupil of [[Yaqob of India|Mar Yaqob of India]], a 14th-century East Syriac bishop of Cranganore.  Zacharias is the author of the oldest surviving Syriac manuscript of India archived as ''Vatican Syrian Codex 22'' which details the city of Cranganore, relations between the Church of the East and the St. Thomas Christians, the Patriarch [[Yahballaha III]], and Mar Yaqob of Cranganore whom he describes in the following quote:{{sfn|Hatch|2012|p=226}}\n\n<blockquote>\"This holy book was written in the royal, renowned and famous city of Chingala (Cranganore) in Malabar in the time of the great captain and director of the holy catholic church of the East.. our blessed and holy Father Mar Yahd Alaha V and in the time of bishop Mar Jacob, Metropolitan and director of the holy see of the Apostle Mar Thoma, that is to say, our great captain and the director of the entire holy church of Christian India\"{{sfn|Podipara|1979|p=15}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the year 1456 the Knanaya Community approached the Kingdom of Vadakkumkoor to rebuild [[Kaduthuruthy Valiya Palli|Kaduthuruthy St. Mary's ''Valiya Palli'' (Great Church)]]. In audience with the King of Vadakkumkoor, the Knanaya presented him ''ponpannam'' (gold/gifts given to monarchs). After receiving permission to reconstruct the church, masons were called who during this time extended the walls of Kaduthuruthy Church and added a ''gopuram'' (entrance tower). The historical Knanaya folk song \"Alappan Adiyil\" written on [[palm-leaf manuscript]] records the reconstruction of Kaduthuruthy Church and includes the colophon date 1456. {{sfn|Luke|1911}}\n\n===Early Portuguese Era=== \n\nThe first known extensive written evidence for a division in the Saint Thomas Christian community dates to the 16th century, when [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonial]] officials took notice of it.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=83}}{{sfn|Sharma & Sharma|2004|p=12}} A 1518 letter by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary Alvaro Penteado mentions a conflict between the children of Thomas of Cana, hinting at a rift in the community in contemporary times.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=83}} In 1525, [[Yaqob Abuna|Mar Jacob]], a Chaldean bishop in India, recorded a battle the year before between the [[Kingdom of Cochin]] and the [[Zamorin of Calicut]] that destroyed Cranganore and many Knanaya homes and churches.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=2-3}}{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=30}} The destruction of their entire township and the burning of their churches caused the Knanaya to disperse from the city to other settlements.

Besides collecting duties, the Knanaya in Chunkom were also known to mold \"famous\" pottery.{{sfn|Whitehouse|1873|p=125}}\n\nIn the year 1550, the Portuguese commander Francesco Silveira de Menesis aided the [[Kingdom of Cochin|King of Cochin's]] army in a victorious battle against the Kingdom of Vadakkumkoor (Kaduthuruthy), subsequently killing its king Veera Manikatachen.{{sfn|Whitehouse|1873|p=125}}{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=150}}{{sfn|Trivedi|2010|p=70}} After the death of their king, the entire army of the Kingdom of Vadakkumkoor formed itself into ''chaver'' (suicide) squads and sought revenge against the Syrian Christians in the region who they viewed as co-religionist of the regicidal Portuguese. The Knanaya ''Tharakan'' (minister) Kunchacko of the Kunnassery Family was a member of the Vadakkankur Royal Court and a close advisor to the slain king. In order to save his people from the ire of the chaver squads, Kunchacko Tharakan gathered the Knanaya from their parish of [[Kaduthuruthy Valiya Palli|Kaduthuruthy St. Mary's ''Valiya Palli'' (Great Church)]], as well as all other Syrian Christians he could find within the vicinity of Vadakkankur and fled to the region of [[Mulanthuruthy]] where he eventually built [[Mulanthuruthy Marthoman Church|Mulanthuruthy Church]]. The Knanaya were later called back to Kaduthurthy by the descendants of Veera Manikatachan and left Mulanthuruthy Church in the care and protection of the Northist St. Thomas Christians who remained there.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=150}}{{sfn|Whitehouse|1873|p=125}}\n\n[[File:Persian Cross at Kottayam valiya pally.png|thumb|Persian Cross at Kottayam Valiya Palli]]\n\nDuring this same altercation with the Kingdom of Vadakkumkoor in 1550, a portion of the Knanaya from Kaduthuruthy were invited to the city of Kottayam by its chieftain in the [[Thekkumkur|Kingdom of Thekkumkur]] and were given permission to build a church which they consecrated as Kottayam St. Mary's Knanaya Valiya Palli.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}}{{sfn|Trivedi|2010|p=71}} These Knanaya had brought with them ancient relics from Kaduthuruthy Church known as the [[St. Thomas Cross|Persian Crosses]] which are till this day exhibited at Kottayam Valiya Palli.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}}\n\nIn 1566 Portuguese official Damio De Goes records that the Thomas of Cana copper plate grant was given to the Portuguese treasurer Pero De Sequeia by the Chaldean Bishop of Cranganore Mar Jacob in 1524 after the destruction of the city in order to keep the plates safe.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}} Treasurer Pero De Sequeia then took the plates to the Portuguese governor of India Martim Afonso De Sousa who ordered the local people to translate the context of the plates.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}} To the governors dismay none of the local people could interpret the antiquity of the language on the plates, however the Portuguese eventually came into contact with a Cochin Jewish linguist who De Goes expresses was \u201cversed in many languages\u201d.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}}Governor De Sousa sent the plates to the Jewish linguist with orders from the King of Cochin to interpret and translate its context.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}}\n\nThe linguist translated the context of the plates and stated that they contained social, economic, and religious rights given to Thomas of Cana by a local ruler and were written in three languages, namely \u201cChaldean, Malabar, and Arabic\u201d.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}}De Goes notes that physically the plates were \u201cof fine metal each one palm and a half long and four fingers broad, written on both sides, and strung together at the top with a thick copper wire\u201d.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}}The Cochin Jew returned the plates to the Portuguese, who then had his Malayalam description of the plates translated to the Portuguese language in a written copy.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=4-5}} This copy was later sent by treasurer Pero De Sequeia to Portuguese King Dom Joao III.

This was epitomized by the [[Synod of Diamper]] in 1599 which took place at Udiamperoor Knanaya Church. The synod led by the Portuguese Archbishop of Goa, [[Aleixo de Menezes]] brought forth many social and liturgical reforms which forcefully Latinized the East Syriac Rite followed by the St. Thomas Christians and formally brought all the Indian churches under the Archdiocese of Goa and the Roman Catholic Church. {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=208-214}} \n\nIn the 17th century, tensions began to broil between the St. Thomas Christians and the Portuguese over their hegemony of the community. The native Archdeacon and ecclesial head of the community, [[Thoma I|Archdeacon Thomas]] was often at odds with the Portuguese prelates. {{sfn|Frykenburg|2008|pp=367}} Tensions further grew with the arrival of the Syrian Bishop [[Ahatallah|Mor Ahatallah]] in India in 1652 who claimed to have been ordained as the \"Patriarch of the Whole of India and China\" by the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. The St. Thomas Christians wholeheartedly welcomed Mor Ahatallah and Archdeacon Thomas had hoped that this new Syrian bishop could free the community from the yolk of the Portuguese hierarchy{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=316-317}} Knowing of his influence, the Portuguese had detained Mor Ahatallah at Cochin and arranged for a ship to take him Goa. Archdeacon Thomas is then noted to have arrived at Cochin backed by the militia of the St. Thomas Christians and demanded the Syrian bishops release. The Portuguese officials responded to Thomas and his militia by stating that the ship carrying Ahatallah had already left to Goa. {{sfn|Frykenburg|2008|pp=367-378}} After this, Mor Ahatallah was never heard from again in India which started to incite anti-Portuguese sentiment among the community. Rumors had spread that the Portuguese had drowned Mor Ahatallah in the harbor at Cochin, this rumor became the breaking point in the relationship between the St. Thomas Christians and the Portuguese {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=319}}\n\nIn mass rebellion against the Portuguese clergy and in particular Archbishop Francisco Garcia Mendes, the St. Thomas Christians met on January 3, 1653 at Our Lady of Mattenchery Church to convoke the [[Coonan Cross Oath]]. The oath expressed that the community would no longer obey Archbishop Garcia nor the Portuguese Jesuits but instead only recognize their native archdeacon as the governor of their church. {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=319}} After the oath, scholar [[Stephen Neill]] notes that the Knanaya priest [[Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen Kathanar]] of Kallissery played a major role in the eventual schism of the St. Thomas Christians from the Roman Catholic Church. Being a skilled Syriac writer, it is believed that Itty Thommen forged two letters supposedly from Mor Ahatallah one of which stated that in the absence of a bishop, twelve priests could lay hands on Archdeacon Thomas and consecrate him as their new patriarch, an old oriental Christian tradition. The two forged letters were read to mass crowds during church services and were received with much praise from the community. One of the letters was laid on the head of Archdeacon Thomas and twelve priests consecrated him as the first native bishop of Kerala. News of the event was spread throughout the churches of the St. Thomas Christians who accepted it with much joy in the fact that for the first time in their history a native bishop was consecrated.{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=320-321}} \n\nDuring these events, nearly the entire Knanaya community had remained faithful to Archbishop Garcia, questioning the validity of Archdeacon Thomas\u2019 ordination as non-canonical, with only Itty Thommen and his parishioners at Kallissery Knanaya Church supporting the archdeacon. {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=322}}{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=29-31}} Other priests of the Knanaya became aware of Itty Thommens actions and called them into question.{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=322}} In October 1653, the Knanaya convened a meeting at Kottayam in-which it was decided that none of them should accept Archdeacon Thomas as their bishop, nor should any of their people meet with him. The community even resolved that a young Knanaya who had been given minor orders from Archdeacon Thomas should not be recognized as a priest. Out of the five churches of the Knanaya, Kaduthuruthy, Chunkom, Kottayam, and Udiamperoor remained staunchly faithful to Archbishop Garcia, while only Kallissery Church led by Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen remained in rebellion.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=29-31}} Northist St. Thomas Christians also almost entirely defected from Archdeacon Thomas and instead supported Thomas' cousin and rival [[Alexander De Campo|Parambil Chandy]]. Portuguese Archbishop and successor of Fransico Garcia, Giuseppe Maria Sebastiani noted that the Knanaya greatly supported Parambil Chandy even though he was a Northist St. Thomas Christian. In early 1663, the Knanaya tax-collector Pachikara Tharakan of Chunkom had met with Bishop Sebastiani and pledged the support of the Knanaya community to Parambil Chandy, stating that they would always remain obedient to him \"even if all others abandoned him\". In response, Parambil Chandy expressed that he would protect and preserve the Knanaya with his life, even more than his own community the Northist{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=35-36}} Parambil Chandy would be ordained as the Catholic bishop of the St. Thomas Christians in 1663 at Kaduthuruthy Knanaya Church.{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=325}} \n\nThe St. Thomas Christians would now be forever internally divide into Catholic and Malankara factions with the majority of the community who sided with Parambil Chandy creating the basis for the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] ([[Eastern Catholic]]), while the minority who remained with Archdeaon Thomas creating the [[Malankara Church]] ([[Oriental Orthodox]]){{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=86}}\n\n===Later Colonial Era===\n[[File:Poothathil Itti Kuruvilla Tharakan - 18th Century.jpg|thumb|Poothathil Itti Kuruvilla Tharakan]]\nIn the early 18th century (1720) the Syrian Jacobite ''Catanar'' from Kaduthuruthy Fr. Mathew Veticutel wrote a short history of the Malabar Church in Syriac, which is archived today as ''MS 1213'' at Leyden Academy Library. In contrast to the previously documented notations from European sources in the 16th and 17th centuries,  Fr. Mathew's work is the first published native account of the historical traditions of the various ancient Christian missions to India such as that of St. Thomas the Apostle, Thomas of Cana, and bishops [[Mar Sabor and Mar Proth]]. Fr. Veticutel expresses that the native St. Thomas Christians had long been without priests and presbyters.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=42}} The Catholicos of the East had sent Thomas of Cana to investigate the condition of the Church in India. When Thomas returned and reported on the St. Thomas Christians, the Catholicos ordered Thomas, Uraha Mar Yoseph (Metropolitan of Edessa), presbyters and deacons, as well as men and woman from Jerusalem, Baghdad, and Nineveh to embark to India.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=43}} When the migrants arrived in the year 345, they were met by the Native St. Thomas Christians and later approached the King of Malabar from whom they received land and privileges in the form of copper plates. A town and church was then constructed in Cranganore upon which 472 houses were built in which the migrants and native St. Thomas Christians inhabited two distinct sides. {{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=44}}\n\nIn the late 18th century the Syrian Catholics could no longer tolerate the numerous abuses of power by the Roman Catholic Church towards the St. Thomas Christians which included the suppression of the Syriac Rite and the torturing of native clergy.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=15-18}} The tension between the Native Clergy and Roman Church met a breaking point when the Latin hierarchy had imprisoned and starved to death Northist ''Cathanar'' (Syriac priest) Chacko of Edappalli in 1774, who was wrongfully accused of stealing a monstrance.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=40-41}} After this the Malabar General Church Assembly had joined together in the venture of sending a delegation to Rome in order to meet the pope and have their grievances addressed as well as petition for the ordination of a native Syrian Catholic hierarch. The Northist cathanars [[Kariattil Ousep|Ousep Cariattil]] and [[Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar|Thomman Paremmakkal]] were tasked with undertaking the journey.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=40-41}} The journey was also greatly supported and funded by two Syrian Catholic ''Tharakans'' (ministers/tax collectors), Poothathil Itti Kuruvilla  of the Knanaya Community and Thachil Mathoo of the Northist St. Thomas Christians.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=41-75}} Poothathil Itti Kuruvilla Tharakan had donated 30,000 ''chakrams'' (Indian currency) to the delegation, whose journey to Rome began in his home in the village of [[Neendoor]]. From Neendoor the delegation took Poothathil's country boat all the way to [[Colachel]] on the southern tip of India, after which point they left India.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=50}} The delegation also took one boy of each ethnic group to be admitted to the Propaganda College of Rome, Chacko Malayil of the Knanaya community and Mathoo Palakkal of the Northist.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=65}}\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Early 19th Century Knanaya.png|thumb|Early 20th Century Knanaya in traditional attire and wedding crowns]]\nIn the late 19th century social changes in [[British India]] led to increased wealth and social power for the Saint Thomas Christians. This social change tended to advance internal divisions within the community, including the Southist\u2013Northist division.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=87}} Through this period the Knanaya promoted their own uniqueness and independent identity to push for further opportunities for their community. They sought the establishment of Knanaya-centred diocese' for both the Malankara and Catholic churches, which were founded in 1910 and 1911, respectively.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=87}}\n\nLike other Saint Thomas Christians, many Knanaya have migrated away from Kerala and India since the 20th century. The largest Knanaya diaspora community is located in [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|p=169}} This community originated in the 1950s when a small number of Knanaya and other Kerala natives emigrated to the area as university students; they were followed by more substantial immigration after 1965. The immigrants met up periodically for social events, and in the 1970s organizations for Catholics, members of other Christian churches, and Hindus were formed. In the 1980s the various Indian Catholic [[particular church]]es sent chaplains to Chicago; in 1983 the [[Bishop of Kottayam]] sent a chaplain to minister specifically to the Knanaya Catholics.{{sfn|Jacobsen & Raj|2008|pp=202\u2013207}}\n\n==Genome Mapping==\nA 2019 preliminary genetic analysis of the Knanaya community was undertaken by American geneticist Dr. Razib Khan. Dr. Khan compared four samples of the Knanaya to four samples of the broad Northist St. Thomas Christians by way of genome mapping.{{sfn|Khan|2019|}} Dr. Khan noted the following when comparing the two communities: <blockquote>\"It does seem in relation to the other more generically labeled St. Thomas Christians the four Knanaya show some noticeable Middle Eastern shift.\"{{sfn|Khan|2019|}}</blockquote> The study also used the Treemix tool (a method for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in the history of a set of populations) and noted that the Knanaya were again different from other St. Thomas Christians. After running the Treemix tool, Dr. Khan noted the following about the Knanayas genetic composition:<blockquote> \"...the Knanaya group was different from the other St. Thomas Christians, having a closer position to West Eurasians\".{{sfn|Khan|2019|}}</blockquote>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Knanaya Wedding.jpg|thumb|Knanaya Wedding Mid-20th Century]]\nLike other Saint Thomas Christians, Southist culture is largely derived from [[Syriac Christian]] culture mixed with local Indian customs, with later elements derived from Indian and European contacts. However the Knanaya maintain a unique sub-culture of their own and a number of scholars have found that the distinct traditions and customs of the Knanaya are similar to those of the [[Cochin Jews]] of Kerala. This can be seen through the similarity in folk songs and folk traditions which may reflect the Knanaya's claimed Judeo-Christian ancestry.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118-128}} Scholar of Cochin Jewish culture and history P.M. Jussay notes the following about the cultural similarities: <blockquote>\u201cIn the many splendoured wonder of Kerala\u2019s population, the critical observer is intrigued by the striking similarities that exist between two small communities - the Cochin Jews and the Knanite Christians. Neither of them is said to be of the soil; but having taken root and flourished for long in this fertile land, they have been indistinguishably integrated with its colours and contours. The similarities become significant when the Knanites claim a Jewish origin\u201d</blockquote>{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118}}\n\n===Religious traditions===\nTraditionally the Knanaya have followed the religious traditions and practices of the wider Saint Thomas Christian community. In the 17th century, when the Saint Thomas Christians were split into Catholic and [[Malankara Church]] factions following the [[Coonan Cross Oath]], both the Knanaya and Northist groups were internally divided.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=84\u201385, 87}} The Malankara faction became affiliated with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], an [[Oriental Orthodox]] church based in [[Syria]], while the Catholic faction is now known as the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]]. Beginning in the late 19th century, both Malankara and Catholic Knanaya lobbied for their own dioceses within their respective denominations. In 1910, the Syriac Orthodox Church established a distinct Knanaya-oriented diocese in [[Chingavanam]], which reports directly to the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch|Patriarch of Antioch]]. The following year, the Catholic Church established a Knanaya Catholic [[eparchy]] (diocese) in [[Kottayam]], known as the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam]].{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=87\u201388}}\n\n===Folk songs=== \n{{Infobox song\n| name     = Knanaya Folk Songs \n| cover    = Palm Leaf Relics of Knanaya Folk Songs.jpg\n| alt      =\n| caption  = Palm Leaf Manuscripts of Knanaya Folk Songs\n| type     =\n| artist   =\n| album    =\n| released =\n| format   =\n| recorded =\n| studio   =\n| venue    =\n| genre    = Music of Medieval India\n| length   = 48:39\n| label    =\n| composer =\n| lyricist =\n| producer =\n| misc     = {{External music video|{{YouTube|9SSJRlrcYS4|\"Knanaya Folk Songs\"}}}}\n}}\nKnanaya folk songs are ancient in origins and were first written down in the 17th century on [[palm leaf manuscripts]]. The texts of the palm leaves were compiled and published in 1910 by the Knanaya scholar P.U.

After doing so the Panan would receive payment for their performance in the form of a material donation of items such as betel leaves and other types of charitable aid. Likewise, the Panans would visit the homes of the Knanaya and sing songs of the communities history and heritage. In particular, the Panans would sing of a story in the life of Thomas of Cana during the reign of Cheraman Perumal. The story is narrated from the perspective of the leader of the bards known as Tiruvaranka Panan. The contents of the story revolves around a mission bestowed to Tiruvaranka by Thomas of Cana in which he is to travel to ''Ezhathunadu'' (Sri Lanka) and implore four castes, namely carpenters, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, and molders, to return to Cranganore which they had left due to an infringement on their social traditions. The four castes are initially hesitant to return to Cranganore but are persuaded by Tiruvaranka when he shows them the golden staff of Thomas of Cana which he was granted to take on his journey as a sign of goodwill. After seeing the staff the four castes are content and in their satisfaction remove their own ornaments and smelt a golden crown for Thomas of Cana which they present to him upon their return to the Cranganore. Wearing the crown, Thomas and Tiruvarankan go to meet Cheraman Perumal who is pleased with the success of their mission and grants Thomas of Cana privileges. The remainder of the song sings of the seventy-two historical privileges bestowed upon Thomas.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=427-436}}\n\n===Folk traditions===\nAfter the burning of Craganore in 1524 during a battle between the  [[Zamorin of Calicut]] and the [[Kingdom of Cochin]] which the city was a part of, the homes and temples of both the Cochin Jews and Knanaya were destroyed. The Knanaya historically commemorated this loss by carrying around a handful of charred earth as a keepsake from their ancestral settlement. From this act originated the custom of including a pinch of ash from a bride's home in a knot at the end of her new dress when she went to live with her husband. On account of this, Northists sometimes derisively dub the Knanaya \"Charam kettikal\", or knot makers of ash. The Cochin Jews had a similar custom of keeping a handful of earth from the place their temples once stood.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=30}} The burning of Craganore was a vital and drastic event for both the communities and figures heavily in their stories and songs{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=123}} \n\nBoth the Knanaya and Cochin Jews maintain folk traditions based on figures and stories of the Old Testament. Both groups particularly revere [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]]; the Knanaya perform a [[circle dance]] called \"Poorva Yousepintae Vattakali\" (\"Round Dance of Old Joseph\"), while the Cochin Jews also maintain songs glorifying Joseph.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=124}} The Knanaya and Cochin Jews give local flavor to their Old Testament-based songs, stories and traditions. A Knanaya folk song about [[Book of Tobit|Tobias]] describes his wedding as including Kerala paraphernalia, while a Cochin Jewish folk song describes [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] dressed and groomed like a [[Malayali]] girl or Cochin Jewish bride. For both the Knanaya and Cochin Jews, these flourishes make Bible stories relevant to their current experience.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=125}}\n\n===Passover traditions===\n[[File:Knajewfood.jpg|thumb|Pesaha Appam and Pal]]\nThe tradition of Passover or \"Pesaha\" is practiced every Holy Thursday in the homes of the Knanaya. On the night of Holy Thursday, the \"Pesaha Appam\" or Pesaha bread is made with unleavened flour along with a sweet drink made of milk and jaggery known as \"Pesaha Pal\" (in some families banana is also a part of this custom). The first batch of Pesaha appam is decorated and blessed with palm leaves from Palm Sunday set in the shape of a cross, the Pesaha milk also shares this adornment. The first batch is said to be the most sacred and is only given to members of the family. In ritualistic practice, the family gathers in the home and the father or grandfather of the household blesses and prays over the bread and milk, often also reading a bible passage. He then cuts, portions and distributes the bread, banana, and milk to his family members, giving it to males of the household first. Traditionally after the celebration is over any waste product that was used in the ritual was burned away according to the rules of Leviticus and the sacred nature of the practice. It should also be noted that all utensils and vessels used in the process are either brand new or washed in a ceremonial manner. Pesaha is also regularly practiced in the homes of the larger St. Thomas Christian community but the scope of usage can vary based on the specific denomination and region. Distinctions also occur based on the type of bread and products used and specific rituals that take place. Additionally, if a family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but brought to them by their Syrian Christian neighbors.{{sfn|Alumkalnal|2013|pp=57-71}}\n\n===Wedding traditions===\n[[File: Knanaya Wedding Crown.jpg|thumb|Knanaya Female Vethanmudi (Royal Crowns)]]\nThe Knanaya maintain distinctive wedding traditions and wedding customs that have helped to sustain their identity and culture. These traditions are an amalgamate of Judeo-Christian, Syriac, and Hindu customs, reflecting the Knanaya's claimed origins and the centuries that they have lived as a minority community in India. Historically, Knanaya marriage celebrations lasted several days, with many of the ceremonies centered around the home. In the present day, these ceremonies take place over three days and the wedding traditions can be divided into the categories of betrothal, groom, bride, reception, and miscellaneous. These ceremonies are also accompanied by numerous ancient songs characteristic of the Knanaya.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-38}}\n\nBetrothal customs include ''Kaipidutham'', or \"clasping of hands\". This is an initial agreement and fixing of the marriage, which involves the future bride and groom as well as their paternal uncles. The uncles clasp the hands of the betrothed in the presence of the priest at church. This symbolizes the uncles' and extended families', support and investment in the relationship.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=32-33}} Maternal uncles undertake a Maternal Uncles Agreement, at which they come together at the erection of the poles of the ''pandal'', a canopy and temporary hall set up for the wedding. The uncles from each party exchange a ''kindy'', or water bowl, for rinsing and hand washing. The dowry is also delivered by the bride's maternal uncle to the groom's uncle, and they kneel on a mat in front of a lighted lamp symbolizing Jesus and pray as though in front of an altar.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=32-33}}\n\nBride and groom participate in ceremonies in their respective homes on the eve of the wedding. The groom's ceremony is \"Antham Charthal\" which is now most commonly known as ''Chandam Charthal''. The name signifies the end or last day of the bachelor life of the boy as well as beautifying the boy. The village barber arrives at the pandal and requests permission to shave the groom three times. After receiving permission, the barber performs the ceremonial shaving (historically, this was his first shave), then takes him out to put oil on his head and bathe him, while the assembly sings ancient songs.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=33-34}} The bride's ceremony is ''Mylanchi Ideel'', or \"[[henna]] ceremony\". The bride's palms, feet, and nails are smeared with special green henna, by her maternal grandmother and aunts. Similar ceremonies are found among various ethnic groups across the Middle East, North Africa, and India; the Knanaya give it a Biblical meaning referencing the [[original sin]] of [[Eve]], stating that because Eve walked with her feet to the [[Tree of knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]] and plucked its [[forbidden fruit]] with her palms, the feet and palms of the bride are smeared with henna to cleanse her of Eves original sin. The grandmother then takes the bride to be bathed and changed into a new dress.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=34-35}} Following these ceremonies the bride and groom return to the pandal for the ''Ichappad'' (sweet giving) ceremony, at which the bride and groom are fed white rice pudding with brown sugar by designated elders (paternal elders for the groom, maternal elders for the bride).{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=33-35}}\n\n{{Infobox song\n| name     = Bar Mariam\n| cover    = Knanaya priests chant Bar Maryam.jpg\n| alt      =\n| caption  = Knanaya priests chant the \"Bar Mariam\"\n| type     =\n| artist   =\n| album    =\n| released =\n| format   =\n| recorded =\n| studio   =\n| venue    =\n| genre    = Paraliturgical\n| length   = 4:00-6:00\n| label    =\n| composer =\n| lyricist =\n| producer =\n| misc     = {{External music video|{{YouTube|tod-GfG7LTI|\"Bar Mariam\"}}}}\n}}\nPrior to entering the church for the wedding, the bride and groom greet their parents and elders for ''Sthuthi'' (\"Peace Blessing\"), where they receive blessings from their family.

After the chant, the priests bless the newlyweds with holy water to conclude the ceremony.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=35}}{{sfn|Palackal and Simon|2015}}\n\nThe [[wedding reception]] features several traditions. After the wedding, the assembly holds a great procession to the reception place, including celebratory music and a distinct ritualistic cheer known as \u201cNada Villi\u201d. In the end, the bride and groom are carried by their uncles up to the door.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-38}} In the reception pandal, the groom's mother leads the ''Nellum Neerum'' (\"Welcome Blessing\") to solemnly welcome the newlyweds. The groom's sister holds a lighted brass lamp and a bowl of water, paddy, and leaves from [[Palm Sunday]], symbolizing purification and fertility. The mother traces the [[sign of the cross]] on the couples' foreheads with a wet piece of palm leaf.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}} Special seats called ''manarcolam'' (marriage venue) are prepared for the couple by spreading sheets of wool and white linen, representing the hardships and blessings of married life.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-38}} The bride's mother then gives the ''Vazhu Pidutham'' (Mother's blessing) while placing her hands crosswise on the couple's heads, and all the women present sing the wedding song \"Vazhvenna Vazvhu\".{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}} Following the mother's blessing, relatives present gifts in ''Kacha Thazhukal'' (\"Gift Giving\"). The first gift is a new dress given to the bride's family; family members then remove their gold jewelry and place them on the newlyweds.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}} Afterward is the presentation of milk and fruit, which the couple drinks from the same cup.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}}\n\nAfter the reception is the ''Adachu Thura'' (Bridal Chamber Ceremony), where the bride's mother brings the groom special sweets and foods. The couple and their elders and friends enter the bridal chamber, where the bride's mother promises utensils and ornaments to the groom. They then exit the chamber and the bride and groom are anointed with oil and bathed. They put on new clothes and share a meal with the attendees. Special songs accompany each step.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=38}} Another miscellaneous tradition is the ''Margam Kali'' (\"The Way\", referring to the way of [[Thomas the Apostle]]), a traditional St. Thomas Christian dance. The dance and accompanying songs retell the story of Thomas and his mission to India. {{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}}\n\n===Food===\nThe Knanaya make several special foods. ''Pidy'' is a [[rice ball]] dish traditionally made when sending pregnant women home for a delivery, and some other occasions. ''Venpachor'' is a white rice pudding prepared on the eve of a wedding for the ceremonies of ''Chandam Charthal'' and ''Mylanchi Ideel''. Other bread-based foods and snacks favored by the Knanaya but consumed by the entire Kerala community are [[Achappam]], [[Kuzhalappam]], Avalosunda, and Churutt.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=28}}\n\nKnanaya historically ate on two plantain leaves, one placed over the other. According to folk tradition, this was a royal privilege granted to the community. Today, the Knanaya symbolize this by folding the left side of a plantain leaf underneath to make one leaf as two.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=29}} Knanaya eating together would eat from the same plantain leaf as a sign of cordiality. Catholic and Orthodox Knanaya dining together would eat from the left and right side of the leaf to show that despite their different religious affiliations, they were still part of a united ethnic community.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=28-29}}\n\n===Dress and ornaments===\nKnanaya women historically wore gold earrings with balls and small raised heads, one inch in diameter, known as ''Mekkamothiram'' or ''[[Kunukku]]'', the same earrings are also worn by the Northist Saint Thomas Christians. Southist and Northist women alike wear a distinct type of sari known as the ''Chatta Mundu''. This comprises the ''chatta'', a white [[blouse]] embroidered with design, and the ''mundu'' dress. The ''mundu'' is a long white cloth worn from the waist down, and includes 15 to 21 pleats covering the back thigh in a fan shape representing a palm leaf.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}}\n\nKnanaya men historically wore white shawls as a headdress and wore a white cloth wrapped around the waist. Both are tied in a special way known as ''Njettum Valum Ittu Kettuka''.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}}\n\n===Dance===\n[[File:Knanaya Margam Kali.jpg|thumb|Knanaya Margam Kali]]\nThe Knanaya maintain a distinct round dance, the [[Margamkali]], or \"the way/path\" of Thomas the Apostle. This traditional dance was historically performed among Saint Thomas Christians, but the Knanaya have played a prominent role in preserving and maintaining it since European contact. The Margamkali was traditionally a male dance exhibiting twelve players symbolizing the [[Twelve Apostles]] dancing in a circle around a lighted brass lamp representing Jesus. It is accompanied by ancient songs about Thomas the Apostle, based on the apocryphal 3rd-century text ''[[Acts of Thomas]]''. The song text consists of 450 lines, divided into 14 sections. These songs contain Syriac and Tamil diction, suggesting an origin before the emergence of the Malayalam language in Malabar between the 9th and 13th century.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=31}}\n\nThe Margamkali declined considerably after European colonization. In the 17th century, the Knanaya priest [[Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen Kathanar]] revised the text, which has influenced its current structure. In 1910, scholar P.U. Luke published the text for the first time in his collection of ''Ancient Songs''.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=31}} In 1924 the European priest and scholar Father Hosten was enamored by the Margamkali he saw danced by the Knanaya in Kottayam. He attempted to present the dance at the 1925 Vatican Mission Exhibition, but it was not performed due to mass disapproval by Northist Saint Thomas Christians.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=582-583}} In the 1960s the Saint Thomas Christian scholar of folk culture Chummar Choondal led a sociological survey of the Margamkali. He noted that by that time, it was solely practiced and propagated by the Knanaya and could not be found among Northist communities.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=582-583}} Furthermore, Choondal found that all of the Margam teachers and groups of the time period were Knanaya.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=582-583}} With Choondal's aid, the Knanaya priests George Karukaparambil and Jacob Vellian spearheaded research on the Margamkali in the 1970s and '80s with the help of 33 Knanaya ''ashans'' (teachers). The team systematized the Margamkali and promoted it among schools and cultural organizations. In 1995, Mar Kuriakose Kunnasserry, the bishop of the Knanaya Diocese of Kottayam, established Hadusa (Syriac for dancing/rejoicing) as an All India Institute of Christian Performing Arts.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}}\n\n===Funeral traditions===\nThe Knanaya hold to a death bed tradition based on Old Testament teachings, wherein a dying man gives a final blessing to his children and grandchildren. The father places his hand on the heads of kneeling recipients while giving the invocation.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}} Other funeral traditions include the ''Thazhukuka'', in which friends and relatives embrace a grieving family at a funeral. The family stands in line at the church as the priest sprinkles holy water on them, and friends embrace them. After the burial, the family holds a ceremony at home where they drink from a single tender coconut to symbolize their unity following the death of their loved one.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=28}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | last=Alumkalnal | first=Sunish| year=2013 |title=Pesaha Celebration of Nasranis: A Sociocultural analysis| series= Journal of Indo-Judaic studies |volume=13 |ref={{sfnRef|Alumkalnal|2013}}}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=Wilhelm|authorlink1=Wilhelm Baum|last2=Winkler|first2=Dietmar W.|title=The Church of the East: A Concise History|year=2003|location=London-New York|publisher=Routledge-Curzon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ |ref={{sfnRef|Baum & Winkler|2003}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Coward|first=Harold |title=Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Perspectives and Encounters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6eHgNyNimoAC&pg=PA19|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|isbn=978-81-208-1158-4 |ref={{sfnRef|Coward|1993}} }}\n*{{cite book|first=Ernst |last=Fahlbusch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZUBZlth2qgC&pg=PR1&dq=Fahlbusch+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity+volume+5&hl=de&sa=X&ei=4PWrUMHZIMSN4AS9joC4CQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Knanaya&f=false |title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity: Volume 5 |page=286 |isbn=9780802824172 |publisher=[[William B.

They are differentiated from another part of the community, known in this context as the [[Northists]]. Today there are about 300,000 Knanaya in India and elsewhere.{{sfn|Fahlbusch|2008|p=286}}\n\nThe origins of the division of the Saint Thomas Christians into Northist and Southist groups are unclear. Various traditions trace it back to the arrival of the Syrian merchant [[Thomas of Cana]] (Kn\u0101i Thoma) who led a migration of endogamous [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] [[Syriac Christians]] (possibly of [[Jewish]] origin) to India in the 4th or 8th century. The Knanaya claim descent from Thomas of Cana and those who came with him. The ethnic division between the Knanaya and other St. Thomas Christians was present by the time of the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colonization]] in the 16th century and was noted throughout the [[Colonial India|European colonial era]].\n\nToday, the majority of Knanaya are members of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] ([[Eastern Catholic]]) and the [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church|Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church]] ([[Oriental Orthodox]]). They became increasingly prominent in Kerala in the late 19th century. Many Knanaya migrated away during the 20th and 21st centuries, largely westward, forming communities in non-Malayalam speaking areas, with a large expatriate community currently living in Houston, Texas and [[Chicago]], Illinois, United States.\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Thomas of Cana.jpg|thumb|Thomas of Cana]]\nThe term ''Kn\u0101n\u0101ya'' derives from the name [[Thomas of Cana|Kn\u0101i Thoma]] ([[Anglicisation|anglicized]] as Thomas of Cana), an important figure in the Saint Thomas Christian tradition.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}} The term is derived from Thomas' [[Syriac language|Syriac]] adjectival epithet Kn\u0101'n\u0101ya in reference to the land of [[Canaan]] and is defined as meaning \"Those of Canaan\".{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=85}} The earliest written record of the term used as a designation of the community dates to the 1800s, however notations of the term itself are found in Knanaya folk songs such as the song of the erection of Kallisserry Church in 1580.{{sfn|Luke|1911|p=72}}{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=85}}  Members of the Knanaya Community are also generally called Kn\u0101i or Kn\u0101, in reference to Thomas. Many Knanaya families, especially those of the [[Kaduthuruthy]] region maintain the surname Kin\u0101n, a derivative of Thomas\u2019 epithet. Woman of these families preserve gendered forms of the term, examples of this being Kin\u0101ti Anna, Kin\u0101ti Mariam, etc.{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=1}}\n\nThe ultimate derivation of Thomas' English epithet ''Cana'' is not clear: it may refer to the town of [[Cana]], which is mentioned in the [[Bible]], or it may instead refer to the land of [[Canaan]].{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}}Alternately, it may be a corruption of a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] term for merchant (''Kn\u0101yil'' in Malayalam).{{sfn|Neill|2004|p=42}} However, scholar Richard M. Swiderski states that none of these etymologies are entirely sound.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}} Knanaya priest and scholar Jacob Kollaparambil argues that the \"Cana\" form is a corruption introduced by European scholars in the 18th century based on the [[Malayalam]] form ''Kn\u0101y'' and its variants (Kn\u0101i, Kin\u0101n, Kn\u0101yi) found in the folk tradition of the Knanaya and the common parlance and literature of the people of Malabar.{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|pp=1-20}} This may be a reference to the Christian community of Kynai, in B\u00e9t Aramay\u00e9 in Persia, a historical center of Syriac Christianity.{{sfn|Kollaparambil|1992|p=1}} ''Knanaya'' is the spelling preferred by community members; other less common spellings include ''Cananites'' and ''Cnanites''.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nThe Knanaya are also known as ''Tekkumbhagar'' in Malayalam; this is generally translated into English as \"Southist\", or sometimes \"Southerner\" or \"Suddhist\". This is in reference to the historically significant geographical division between them and other Saint Thomas Christians, who are known as ''Vadakumbhagar'' or Northists in this context.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=73}}\n\n===Titles===\nHistorically the Knanaya held the title of being the \"protectors of seventeen castes\", an authority given to them by the [[Cheraman Perumal]] according to folk tradition. This title which was reflective of the historical high caste status of the Knanaya, is to this day exhibited during Knanaya marriage ceremonies when individuals taking part in the rituals ask permission before fulfilling their designated role. A prominent example of this is seen during the \"Chandam Charthal\" or grooms beautification ceremony, in which the barber petitions the assembly three times with the following request: \"I ask the gentlemen here who have superiority over 17 castes, may I shave the bridegroom?\".{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=470}}\n\nThe Knanaya were also known as ''Ancharapallikar'' or the \"Owners of Five and a Half churches\" a title reflective of the five churches owned by the Southist Community before the [[Synod of Diamper]] in 1599. The churches are listed as the following: Udayamperoor, Kaduthuruthy, Kottayam, Chunkom, and Kallissery. The \"half church\" is a reference to the half privilege and share the Knanaya held in other churches they co-owned with the Northist St. Thomas Christians, usually in areas where not many Knanaya lived.{{sfn|Vellian|2001|p=2}}\n\n==History==\n===Origins and traditions===\n[[File:Thomas of Cana and the Knanaya Depart for India.jpg|thumb|Thomas of Cana and the Knanaya Depart for India]]\nIt is not clear how the division of the Saint Thomas Christians into Southern and Northern groups originated. The earliest extensive written evidence for the split dates to the 16th century.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=77}} The St. Thomas Christian tradition defines the division as being both geographical and ethnic, expressing that the Native St. Thomas Christians initially resided on the north side of the [[Chera Dynasty|Chera Empire's]] capitol city of Cranganore while the Middle Eastern migrant Knanaya arrived and settled on the south side, which subsequently led to the designation Northist and Southist.{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}} Directional divisions within communities are common in Kerala, including among Hindu groups.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=76\u201380}}{{sfn|Coward|1993|p=19}} A similar north\u2013south division is found among the [[Nairs]], and it historically appears to have been in place in the early [[Brahmin]] settlements in the area.

In the Northist versions, both Northists and Southists are descended from marriages between Thoma's party and indigenous Christians, but the Knanaya are descended from Syrian servants who married \"low caste\" Keralans; the Knanayas' endogamy and \"purity\" are thus borne out of their exclusion by the higher class Northists. These variants frequently trace Knanaya descent back to a ''dobi'' (washerwoman); in some versions of this story, she became Thoma's concubine, while in other she married a lower-caste [[Maaran]] boy.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=80\u201382}} This assertion is based on the 1676 Portuguese document \"M.S Sloane 2748-A\", a likely forgery attributed to the [[Discalced Carmelites|Carmelite]] priest Father Mathew.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=36}}\n\nHistorian of medieval India and Northist priest Pius Malekandathil argues that the two-wives legend was simply a creation of rivalry between the Middle Eastern migrant Knanaya and the Native St. Thomas Christians. Malekandathil expresses that the story originated in the medieval era due to the two ethnic groups of Christians asserting socioeconomic dominance over the other. Furthermore,  Malekandathil notes that the two-wives legend is not the accepted tradition among the people of Kerala but instead that the indigenous Saint Thomas Christians got the appellation \"Northists\" because they were initially located on the northern part of the city of Cranganore, while the migrant Knanaya under the leadership of Thomas of Cana were given the southern side of the city which led to the generic title of \"Southists\".{{sfn|Malekandathil|2003|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n====Jewish-Christian Claim====\nThe Knanaya strongly attest that the Syriac Christian migrants who arrived with Thomas of Cana were Jewish-Christians (endogamous Jews who converted to Syriac Christianity). This ideal is established from cultural aspects of the community such as Knanaya folk songs first written on palm-leave manuscripts in the 17th century from which the Knanaya disseminate much of their history and heritage. Many of the historical songs allude to the migrants being of Jewish descent such as the song ''Nallor Oraslem'' (The Good Jerusalem) which states the migrants prayed at the tomb of the [[Ezra|Jewish Prophet Ezra]] before departing to India. A plethora of Jewish scholars such as Dr. P.M. Jussay, Dr. Nathan Katz, Dr. Shalva Weil, and Dr. Ohpira Gamliel have all noted that the Knanaya maintain cultural similarities to Jewish communities, a factor which could allude to the communities claimed Jewish origins.{{sfn|Weil|1982|pp=175-196}}{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118-128}}{{sfn|Gamliel|2009|pp=90}} Other scholars entirely accept the Jewish-Christian claim of the Knanaya such as Oxford historian Dr. Robert Eric Frykenberg.{{sfn|Frykenberg|2010|pp=109}}\n\nIn 1939, the Knanaya politician and author Joseph Chazhikaden published a book on the community, ''Tekkumbhagasamudayam Charitram'', in which he included some aspects of the communities Jewish claim. Chazhikaden built upon the Thomas of Cana tradition but asserted that Thomas' followers originated in [[Judea]]. According to Chazhikaden, the group converted to Christianity while maintaining their distinct culture and identity.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|pp=95\u201396}} Eventually, they were forced out of their homeland and moved to [[Cranganore]], where they were welcomed by the ruler Cheraman Perumal and lived near, but maintained their separateness from, the indigenous \"Northist\" Saint Thomas Christians.

According to tradition the three churches were built by Thomas of Cana when the community arrived to India.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=22}} Zacharias was the 14 year old deacon of St. Kuriakose Church as well as the scribe and pupil of [[Yaqob of India|Mar Yaqob of India]], a 14th-century East Syriac bishop of Cranganore.  Zacharias is the author of the oldest surviving Syriac manuscript of India archived as ''Vatican Syrian Codex 22'' which details the city of Cranganore, relations between the Church of the East and the St. Thomas Christians, the Patriarch [[Yahballaha III]], and Mar Yaqob of Cranganore whom he describes in the following quote:{{sfn|Hatch|2012|p=226}}\n\n<blockquote>\"This holy book was written in the royal, renowned and famous city of Chingala (Cranganore) in Malabar in the time of the great captain and director of the holy catholic church of the East.. our blessed and holy Father Mar Yahd Alaha V and in the time of bishop Mar Jacob, Metropolitan and director of the holy see of the Apostle Mar Thoma, that is to say, our great captain and the director of the entire holy church of Christian India\"{{sfn|Podipara|1979|p=15}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the year 1456 the Knanaya Community approached the Kingdom of Vadakkumkoor to rebuild [[Kaduthuruthy Valiya Palli|Kaduthuruthy St. Mary's ''Valiya Palli'' (Great Church)]].

This was epitomized by the [[Synod of Diamper]] in 1599 which took place at Udiamperoor Knanaya Church. The synod led by the Portuguese Archbishop of Goa, [[Aleixo de Menezes]] brought forth many social and liturgical reforms which forcefully Latinized the East Syriac Rite followed by the St. Thomas Christians and formally brought all the Indian churches under the Archdiocese of Goa and the Roman Catholic Church. {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=208-214}} \n\nIn the 17th century, tensions began to broil between the St. Thomas Christians and the Portuguese over their hegemony of the community.

The St. Thomas Christians wholeheartedly welcomed Mor Ahatallah and Archdeacon Thomas had hoped that this new Syrian bishop could free the community from the yolk of the Portuguese hierarchy{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=316-317}} Knowing of his influence, the Portuguese had detained Mor Ahatallah at Cochin and arranged for a ship to take him Goa.

Being a skilled Syriac writer, it is believed that Itty Thommen forged two letters supposedly from Mor Ahatallah one of which stated that in the absence of a bishop, twelve priests could lay hands on Archdeacon Thomas and consecrate him as their new patriarch, an old oriental Christian tradition. The two forged letters were read to mass crowds during church services and were received with much praise from the community. One of the letters was laid on the head of Archdeacon Thomas and twelve priests consecrated him as the first native bishop of Kerala. News of the event was spread throughout the churches of the St. Thomas Christians who accepted it with much joy in the fact that for the first time in their history a native bishop was consecrated.{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=320-321}} \n\nDuring these events, nearly the entire Knanaya community had remained faithful to Archbishop Garcia, questioning the validity of Archdeacon Thomas\u2019 ordination as non-canonical, with only Itty Thommen and his parishioners at Kallissery Knanaya Church supporting the archdeacon. {{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=322}}{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=29-31}} Other priests of the Knanaya became aware of Itty Thommens actions and called them into question.{{sfn|Neill|2004|pp=322}} In October 1653, the Knanaya convened a meeting at Kottayam in-which it was decided that none of them should accept Archdeacon Thomas as their bishop, nor should any of their people meet with him. The community even resolved that a young Knanaya who had been given minor orders from Archdeacon Thomas should not be recognized as a priest. Out of the five churches of the Knanaya, Kaduthuruthy, Chunkom, Kottayam, and Udiamperoor remained staunchly faithful to Archbishop Garcia, while only Kallissery Church led by Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen remained in rebellion.{{sfn|Vellian|1986|p=29-31}} Northist St. Thomas Christians also almost entirely defected from Archdeacon Thomas and instead supported Thomas' cousin and rival [[Alexander De Campo|Parambil Chandy]]. Portuguese Archbishop and successor of Fransico Garcia, Giuseppe Maria Sebastiani noted that the Knanaya greatly supported Parambil Chandy even though he was a Northist St. Thomas Christian. In early 1663, the Knanaya tax-collector Pachikara Tharakan of Chunkom had met with Bishop Sebastiani and pledged the support of the Knanaya community to Parambil Chandy, stating that they would always remain obedient to him \"even if all others abandoned him\".

From Neendoor the delegation took Poothathil's country boat all the way to [[Colachel]] on the southern tip of India, after which point they left India.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=50}} The delegation also took one boy of each ethnic group to be admitted to the Propaganda College of Rome, Chacko Malayil of the Knanaya community and Mathoo Palakkal of the Northist.{{sfn|Podipara|1971|p=65}}\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Early 19th Century Knanaya.png|thumb|Early 20th Century Knanaya in traditional attire and wedding crowns]]\nIn the late 19th century social changes in [[British India]] led to increased wealth and social power for the Saint Thomas Christians. This social change tended to advance internal divisions within the community, including the Southist\u2013Northist division.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=87}} Through this period the Knanaya promoted their own uniqueness and independent identity to push for further opportunities for their community. They sought the establishment of Knanaya-centred diocese' for both the Malankara and Catholic churches, which were founded in 1910 and 1911, respectively.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|p=87}}\n\nLike other Saint Thomas Christians, many Knanaya have migrated away from Kerala and India since the 20th century. The largest Knanaya diaspora community is located in [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Swiderski|1988b|p=169}} This community originated in the 1950s when a small number of Knanaya and other Kerala natives emigrated to the area as university students; they were followed by more substantial immigration after 1965. The immigrants met up periodically for social events, and in the 1970s organizations for Catholics, members of other Christian churches, and Hindus were formed. In the 1980s the various Indian Catholic [[particular church]]es sent chaplains to Chicago; in 1983 the [[Bishop of Kottayam]] sent a chaplain to minister specifically to the Knanaya Catholics.{{sfn|Jacobsen & Raj|2008|pp=202\u2013207}}\n\n==Genome Mapping==\nA 2019 preliminary genetic analysis of the Knanaya community was undertaken by American geneticist Dr. Razib Khan. Dr. Khan compared four samples of the Knanaya to four samples of the broad Northist St. Thomas Christians by way of genome mapping.{{sfn|Khan|2019|}} Dr. Khan noted the following when comparing the two communities: <blockquote>\"It does seem in relation to the other more generically labeled St. Thomas Christians the four Knanaya show some noticeable Middle Eastern shift.\"{{sfn|Khan|2019|}}</blockquote> The study also used the Treemix tool (a method for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in the history of a set of populations) and noted that the Knanaya were again different from other St. Thomas Christians. After running the Treemix tool, Dr. Khan noted the following about the Knanayas genetic composition:<blockquote> \"...the Knanaya group was different from the other St. Thomas Christians, having a closer position to West Eurasians\".{{sfn|Khan|2019|}}</blockquote>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Knanaya Wedding.jpg|thumb|Knanaya Wedding Mid-20th Century]]\nLike other Saint Thomas Christians, Southist culture is largely derived from [[Syriac Christian]] culture mixed with local Indian customs, with later elements derived from Indian and European contacts. However the Knanaya maintain a unique sub-culture of their own and a number of scholars have found that the distinct traditions and customs of the Knanaya are similar to those of the [[Cochin Jews]] of Kerala. This can be seen through the similarity in folk songs and folk traditions which may reflect the Knanaya's claimed Judeo-Christian ancestry.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118-128}} Scholar of Cochin Jewish culture and history P.M. Jussay notes the following about the cultural similarities: <blockquote>\u201cIn the many splendoured wonder of Kerala\u2019s population, the critical observer is intrigued by the striking similarities that exist between two small communities - the Cochin Jews and the Knanite Christians. Neither of them is said to be of the soil; but having taken root and flourished for long in this fertile land, they have been indistinguishably integrated with its colours and contours. The similarities become significant when the Knanites claim a Jewish origin\u201d</blockquote>{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118}}\n\n===Religious traditions===\nTraditionally the Knanaya have followed the religious traditions and practices of the wider Saint Thomas Christian community. In the 17th century, when the Saint Thomas Christians were split into Catholic and [[Malankara Church]] factions following the [[Coonan Cross Oath]], both the Knanaya and Northist groups were internally divided.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=84\u201385, 87}} The Malankara faction became affiliated with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], an [[Oriental Orthodox]] church based in [[Syria]], while the Catholic faction is now known as the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]]. Beginning in the late 19th century, both Malankara and Catholic Knanaya lobbied for their own dioceses within their respective denominations. In 1910, the Syriac Orthodox Church established a distinct Knanaya-oriented diocese in [[Chingavanam]], which reports directly to the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch|Patriarch of Antioch]]. The following year, the Catholic Church established a Knanaya Catholic [[eparchy]] (diocese) in [[Kottayam]], known as the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam]].{{sfn|Swiderski|1988a|pp=87\u201388}}\n\n===Folk songs=== \n{{Infobox song\n| name     = Knanaya Folk Songs \n| cover    = Palm Leaf Relics of Knanaya Folk Songs.jpg\n| alt      =\n| caption  = Palm Leaf Manuscripts of Knanaya Folk Songs\n| type     =\n| artist   =\n| album    =\n| released =\n| format   =\n| recorded =\n| studio   =\n| venue    =\n| genre    = Music of Medieval India\n| length   = 48:39\n| label    =\n| composer =\n| lyricist =\n| producer =\n| misc     = {{External music video|{{YouTube|9SSJRlrcYS4|\"Knanaya Folk Songs\"}}}}\n}}\nKnanaya folk songs are ancient in origins and were first written down in the 17th century on [[palm leaf manuscripts]]. The texts of the palm leaves were compiled and published in 1910 by the Knanaya scholar P.U. Luke in his text ''Puratana Pattukal'', or ''Ancient Songs''.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=119}}{{sfn|Luke|1911|}}{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=31}}{{sfn|Gamliel|2009|pp=390}} The songs were written in Old Malayalam but contain diction and lexemes from Sanskrit, Syriac, and Tamil indicating their antiquity.{{sfn|Gamliel|2009|pp=80}} Analytically, these ancient songs contain folklore about the faith, customs and practices of the community, narratives of historical events (such as the mission of St. Thomas the Apostle and the immigration of the Knanaya to India), biblical stories, songs of churches, and the lives of saints.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=119}} Scholars have also found that the songs of the Knanaya are of a similar composure, linguistics, and characteristic to that of the Cochin Jews and that some songs even have almost the same lyrics with the exception of a few words or stanzas. According to the Cochin Jewish scholar P. M. Jussay, \"these similarities are not accidental and cannot be easily explained\".{{sfn|Jussay|2005|pp=118-128}}{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=32}}\n\nKnanaya \"Kuli Pattu\" or Bath Song:\n<blockquote><poem>\n''\"Ponnum methiyadimel melle melle avan natannu\n(With golden sandals he slowly walked)\n''Velli methiyadimel melle melle aval natannu''\"''\n(With silver sandals she slowly walked){{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=121}}\n</poem></blockquote>\nCochin Jewish procession song:\n<blockquote><poem>\n''\"Ponnum methiyadimel melle natannan, Chiriyanandan,\n(With golden sandals Chiriyanandan ([[Joseph Rabban]]) slowly walked)\n''Velli methiyadimel melle natannan, Chiriyanandan''\"''\n(With silver sandals Chiriyanandan (Joseph Rabban) slowly walked){{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=121}}\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nSome songs show the influence of the Hindu culture of Kerala. For instance, the Knanaya song ''Mailanjipattu'' is adapted from the Hindu song ''Krishnagatha''.{{sfn|Swiderski|1988c|pp=128\u2013133}}\n\n===Songs of Hindu Bards===\nHistorically a class of bards known as ''Panans'' would visit the homes of nobles castes in Kerala and sing songs of heroic figures as well as legendary events. After doing so the Panan would receive payment for their performance in the form of a material donation of items such as betel leaves and other types of charitable aid. Likewise, the Panans would visit the homes of the Knanaya and sing songs of the communities history and heritage. In particular, the Panans would sing of a story in the life of Thomas of Cana during the reign of Cheraman Perumal. The story is narrated from the perspective of the leader of the bards known as Tiruvaranka Panan. The contents of the story revolves around a mission bestowed to Tiruvaranka by Thomas of Cana in which he is to travel to ''Ezhathunadu'' (Sri Lanka) and implore four castes, namely carpenters, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, and molders, to return to Cranganore which they had left due to an infringement on their social traditions. The four castes are initially hesitant to return to Cranganore but are persuaded by Tiruvaranka when he shows them the golden staff of Thomas of Cana which he was granted to take on his journey as a sign of goodwill. After seeing the staff the four castes are content and in their satisfaction remove their own ornaments and smelt a golden crown for Thomas of Cana which they present to him upon their return to the Cranganore. Wearing the crown, Thomas and Tiruvarankan go to meet Cheraman Perumal who is pleased with the success of their mission and grants Thomas of Cana privileges. The remainder of the song sings of the seventy-two historical privileges bestowed upon Thomas.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=427-436}}\n\n===Folk traditions===\nAfter the burning of Craganore in 1524 during a battle between the  [[Zamorin of Calicut]] and the [[Kingdom of Cochin]] which the city was a part of, the homes and temples of both the Cochin Jews and Knanaya were destroyed. The Knanaya historically commemorated this loss by carrying around a handful of charred earth as a keepsake from their ancestral settlement. From this act originated the custom of including a pinch of ash from a bride's home in a knot at the end of her new dress when she went to live with her husband. On account of this, Northists sometimes derisively dub the Knanaya \"Charam kettikal\", or knot makers of ash. The Cochin Jews had a similar custom of keeping a handful of earth from the place their temples once stood.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=30}} The burning of Craganore was a vital and drastic event for both the communities and figures heavily in their stories and songs{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=123}} \n\nBoth the Knanaya and Cochin Jews maintain folk traditions based on figures and stories of the Old Testament. Both groups particularly revere [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]]; the Knanaya perform a [[circle dance]] called \"Poorva Yousepintae Vattakali\" (\"Round Dance of Old Joseph\"), while the Cochin Jews also maintain songs glorifying Joseph.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=124}} The Knanaya and Cochin Jews give local flavor to their Old Testament-based songs, stories and traditions. A Knanaya folk song about [[Book of Tobit|Tobias]] describes his wedding as including Kerala paraphernalia, while a Cochin Jewish folk song describes [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] dressed and groomed like a [[Malayali]] girl or Cochin Jewish bride. For both the Knanaya and Cochin Jews, these flourishes make Bible stories relevant to their current experience.{{sfn|Jussay|2005|p=125}}\n\n===Passover traditions===\n[[File:Knajewfood.jpg|thumb|Pesaha Appam and Pal]]\nThe tradition of Passover or \"Pesaha\" is practiced every Holy Thursday in the homes of the Knanaya. On the night of Holy Thursday, the \"Pesaha Appam\" or Pesaha bread is made with unleavened flour along with a sweet drink made of milk and jaggery known as \"Pesaha Pal\" (in some families banana is also a part of this custom). The first batch of Pesaha appam is decorated and blessed with palm leaves from Palm Sunday set in the shape of a cross, the Pesaha milk also shares this adornment. The first batch is said to be the most sacred and is only given to members of the family. In ritualistic practice, the family gathers in the home and the father or grandfather of the household blesses and prays over the bread and milk, often also reading a bible passage. He then cuts, portions and distributes the bread, banana, and milk to his family members, giving it to males of the household first. Traditionally after the celebration is over any waste product that was used in the ritual was burned away according to the rules of Leviticus and the sacred nature of the practice. It should also be noted that all utensils and vessels used in the process are either brand new or washed in a ceremonial manner. Pesaha is also regularly practiced in the homes of the larger St. Thomas Christian community but the scope of usage can vary based on the specific denomination and region. Distinctions also occur based on the type of bread and products used and specific rituals that take place. Additionally, if a family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but brought to them by their Syrian Christian neighbors.{{sfn|Alumkalnal|2013|pp=57-71}}\n\n===Wedding traditions===\n[[File: Knanaya Wedding Crown.jpg|thumb|Knanaya Female Vethanmudi (Royal Crowns)]]\nThe Knanaya maintain distinctive wedding traditions and wedding customs that have helped to sustain their identity and culture. These traditions are an amalgamate of Judeo-Christian, Syriac, and Hindu customs, reflecting the Knanaya's claimed origins and the centuries that they have lived as a minority community in India. Historically, Knanaya marriage celebrations lasted several days, with many of the ceremonies centered around the home. In the present day, these ceremonies take place over three days and the wedding traditions can be divided into the categories of betrothal, groom, bride, reception, and miscellaneous. These ceremonies are also accompanied by numerous ancient songs characteristic of the Knanaya.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-38}}\n\nBetrothal customs include ''Kaipidutham'', or \"clasping of hands\". This is an initial agreement and fixing of the marriage, which involves the future bride and groom as well as their paternal uncles. The uncles clasp the hands of the betrothed in the presence of the priest at church. This symbolizes the uncles' and extended families', support and investment in the relationship.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=32-33}} Maternal uncles undertake a Maternal Uncles Agreement, at which they come together at the erection of the poles of the ''pandal'', a canopy and temporary hall set up for the wedding. The uncles from each party exchange a ''kindy'', or water bowl, for rinsing and hand washing. The dowry is also delivered by the bride's maternal uncle to the groom's uncle, and they kneel on a mat in front of a lighted lamp symbolizing Jesus and pray as though in front of an altar.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=32-33}}\n\nBride and groom participate in ceremonies in their respective homes on the eve of the wedding. The groom's ceremony is \"Antham Charthal\" which is now most commonly known as ''Chandam Charthal''. The name signifies the end or last day of the bachelor life of the boy as well as beautifying the boy. The village barber arrives at the pandal and requests permission to shave the groom three times. After receiving permission, the barber performs the ceremonial shaving (historically, this was his first shave), then takes him out to put oil on his head and bathe him, while the assembly sings ancient songs.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=33-34}} The bride's ceremony is ''Mylanchi Ideel'', or \"[[henna]] ceremony\". The bride's palms, feet, and nails are smeared with special green henna, by her maternal grandmother and aunts. Similar ceremonies are found among various ethnic groups across the Middle East, North Africa, and India; the Knanaya give it a Biblical meaning referencing the [[original sin]] of [[Eve]], stating that because Eve walked with her feet to the [[Tree of knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]] and plucked its [[forbidden fruit]] with her palms, the feet and palms of the bride are smeared with henna to cleanse her of Eves original sin. The grandmother then takes the bride to be bathed and changed into a new dress.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=34-35}} Following these ceremonies the bride and groom return to the pandal for the ''Ichappad'' (sweet giving) ceremony, at which the bride and groom are fed white rice pudding with brown sugar by designated elders (paternal elders for the groom, maternal elders for the bride).{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=33-35}}\n\n{{Infobox song\n| name     = Bar Mariam\n| cover    = Knanaya priests chant Bar Maryam.jpg\n| alt      =\n| caption  = Knanaya priests chant the \"Bar Mariam\"\n| type     =\n| artist   =\n| album    =\n| released =\n| format   =\n| recorded =\n| studio   =\n| venue    =\n| genre    = Paraliturgical\n| length   = 4:00-6:00\n| label    =\n| composer =\n| lyricist =\n| producer =\n| misc     = {{External music video|{{YouTube|tod-GfG7LTI|\"Bar Mariam\"}}}}\n}}\nPrior to entering the church for the wedding, the bride and groom greet their parents and elders for ''Sthuthi'' (\"Peace Blessing\"), where they receive blessings from their family. This is believed to be a reference to [[Sarah]] receiving her father's blessings in the [[Book of Genesis]].{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=35}} At the end of the marriage ceremony, the priests and congregation sing the \"[[Bar Mariam]]\" (\"Son of Mary\"), a \"paraliturgical\" Syriac chant referencing events from Jesus' life. After the chant, the priests bless the newlyweds with holy water to conclude the ceremony.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=35}}{{sfn|Palackal and Simon|2015}}\n\nThe [[wedding reception]] features several traditions. After the wedding, the assembly holds a great procession to the reception place, including celebratory music and a distinct ritualistic cheer known as \u201cNada Villi\u201d. In the end, the bride and groom are carried by their uncles up to the door.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-38}} In the reception pandal, the groom's mother leads the ''Nellum Neerum'' (\"Welcome Blessing\") to solemnly welcome the newlyweds. The groom's sister holds a lighted brass lamp and a bowl of water, paddy, and leaves from [[Palm Sunday]], symbolizing purification and fertility. The mother traces the [[sign of the cross]] on the couples' foreheads with a wet piece of palm leaf.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}} Special seats called ''manarcolam'' (marriage venue) are prepared for the couple by spreading sheets of wool and white linen, representing the hardships and blessings of married life.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=25-38}} The bride's mother then gives the ''Vazhu Pidutham'' (Mother's blessing) while placing her hands crosswise on the couple's heads, and all the women present sing the wedding song \"Vazhvenna Vazvhu\".{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}} Following the mother's blessing, relatives present gifts in ''Kacha Thazhukal'' (\"Gift Giving\"). The first gift is a new dress given to the bride's family; family members then remove their gold jewelry and place them on the newlyweds.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}} Afterward is the presentation of milk and fruit, which the couple drinks from the same cup.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=36-37}}\n\nAfter the reception is the ''Adachu Thura'' (Bridal Chamber Ceremony), where the bride's mother brings the groom special sweets and foods. The couple and their elders and friends enter the bridal chamber, where the bride's mother promises utensils and ornaments to the groom. They then exit the chamber and the bride and groom are anointed with oil and bathed. They put on new clothes and share a meal with the attendees. Special songs accompany each step.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=38}} Another miscellaneous tradition is the ''Margam Kali'' (\"The Way\", referring to the way of [[Thomas the Apostle]]), a traditional St. Thomas Christian dance. The dance and accompanying songs retell the story of Thomas and his mission to India. {{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}}\n\n===Food===\nThe Knanaya make several special foods. ''Pidy'' is a [[rice ball]] dish traditionally made when sending pregnant women home for a delivery, and some other occasions. ''Venpachor'' is a white rice pudding prepared on the eve of a wedding for the ceremonies of ''Chandam Charthal'' and ''Mylanchi Ideel''. Other bread-based foods and snacks favored by the Knanaya but consumed by the entire Kerala community are [[Achappam]], [[Kuzhalappam]], Avalosunda, and Churutt.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=28}}\n\nKnanaya historically ate on two plantain leaves, one placed over the other. According to folk tradition, this was a royal privilege granted to the community. Today, the Knanaya symbolize this by folding the left side of a plantain leaf underneath to make one leaf as two.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=29}} Knanaya eating together would eat from the same plantain leaf as a sign of cordiality. Catholic and Orthodox Knanaya dining together would eat from the left and right side of the leaf to show that despite their different religious affiliations, they were still part of a united ethnic community.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|pp=28-29}}\n\n===Dress and ornaments===\nKnanaya women historically wore gold earrings with balls and small raised heads, one inch in diameter, known as ''Mekkamothiram'' or ''[[Kunukku]]'', the same earrings are also worn by the Northist Saint Thomas Christians. Southist and Northist women alike wear a distinct type of sari known as the ''Chatta Mundu''. This comprises the ''chatta'', a white [[blouse]] embroidered with design, and the ''mundu'' dress. The ''mundu'' is a long white cloth worn from the waist down, and includes 15 to 21 pleats covering the back thigh in a fan shape representing a palm leaf.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}}\n\nKnanaya men historically wore white shawls as a headdress and wore a white cloth wrapped around the waist. Both are tied in a special way known as ''Njettum Valum Ittu Kettuka''.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}}\n\n===Dance===\n[[File:Knanaya Margam Kali.jpg|thumb|Knanaya Margam Kali]]\nThe Knanaya maintain a distinct round dance, the [[Margamkali]], or \"the way/path\" of Thomas the Apostle. This traditional dance was historically performed among Saint Thomas Christians, but the Knanaya have played a prominent role in preserving and maintaining it since European contact. The Margamkali was traditionally a male dance exhibiting twelve players symbolizing the [[Twelve Apostles]] dancing in a circle around a lighted brass lamp representing Jesus. It is accompanied by ancient songs about Thomas the Apostle, based on the apocryphal 3rd-century text ''[[Acts of Thomas]]''. The song text consists of 450 lines, divided into 14 sections. These songs contain Syriac and Tamil diction, suggesting an origin before the emergence of the Malayalam language in Malabar between the 9th and 13th century.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=31}}\n\nThe Margamkali declined considerably after European colonization. In the 17th century, the Knanaya priest [[Anjilimoottil Itty Thommen Kathanar]] revised the text, which has influenced its current structure. In 1910, scholar P.U. Luke published the text for the first time in his collection of ''Ancient Songs''.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=31}} In 1924 the European priest and scholar Father Hosten was enamored by the Margamkali he saw danced by the Knanaya in Kottayam. He attempted to present the dance at the 1925 Vatican Mission Exhibition, but it was not performed due to mass disapproval by Northist Saint Thomas Christians.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=582-583}} In the 1960s the Saint Thomas Christian scholar of folk culture Chummar Choondal led a sociological survey of the Margamkali. He noted that by that time, it was solely practiced and propagated by the Knanaya and could not be found among Northist communities.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=582-583}} Furthermore, Choondal found that all of the Margam teachers and groups of the time period were Knanaya.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=582-583}} With Choondal's aid, the Knanaya priests George Karukaparambil and Jacob Vellian spearheaded research on the Margamkali in the 1970s and '80s with the help of 33 Knanaya ''ashans'' (teachers). The team systematized the Margamkali and promoted it among schools and cultural organizations. In 1995, Mar Kuriakose Kunnasserry, the bishop of the Knanaya Diocese of Kottayam, established Hadusa (Syriac for dancing/rejoicing) as an All India Institute of Christian Performing Arts.{{sfn|Karukaparambil|2005|p=497}}\n\n===Funeral traditions===\nThe Knanaya hold to a death bed tradition based on Old Testament teachings, wherein a dying man gives a final blessing to his children and grandchildren. The father places his hand on the heads of kneeling recipients while giving the invocation.{{sfn|Vellian|1990|p=30}} Other funeral traditions include the ''Thazhukuka'', in which friends and relatives embrace a grieving family at a funeral.

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]]. It is now a [[scheduled monument]].<ref name=tayl>[https://www.taylp.org/omeka/files/original/35/175/16037_1.31_TLP_Clay_Biggins_Vol._2_2018.03.23_sm.pdf Clay Building Survey] - Tay Landscape Partnership</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest form of Pitmiddle's name was ''Petmeodhel'' (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=off|0}} north of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]] in the centre of the parish, Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/>\n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally payment [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/> By 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving it of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) to the north and Bank (now Guardswell) to the south.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/> A 2017 survey found the ruins of nine buildings.<ref name=tayl/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch \u2013 the latter made from reeds from the banks of the Tay. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Also, Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone).

The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens.

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]]. It is now a [[scheduled monument]].<ref name=tayl>[https://www.taylp.org/omeka/files/original/35/175/16037_1.31_TLP_Clay_Biggins_Vol._2_2018.03.23_sm.pdf Clay Building Survey] - Tay Landscape Partnership</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest form of Pitmiddle's name was ''Petmeodhel'' (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=off|0}} north of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]] in the centre of the parish, Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/>\n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally payment [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/> By 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving it of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) to the north and Bank (now Guardswell) to the south.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/> A 2017 survey found the ruins of nine buildings.<ref name=tayl/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch \u2013 the latter made from reeds from the banks of the Tay. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Also, Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\n[[File:Pitmiddle_c._1900.jpg|thumb|right|Pitmiddle around 1900, looking north to Pitmiddle Hill]]\n\n[[File:Pitmiddle_sawmill.jpg|thumb|right|Employees of Pitmiddle's sawmill in March 1915]]\n\nEarly in the [[19th century]], the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors.

He is also honored as the namesake of [[Gill Coliseum]], opened in 1949, venue for basketball, wrestling, and gymnastics at OSU.\n\n== Early years ==\nBorn in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], [[Oregon]], Gill was the youngest of eight children and his father died when he was a child. His nickname \"Slats\" was given to him at age 12;  he was swimming in a local pond one summer afternoon and upon exiting the pond, a buddy joked with Gill about his scrawny frame with his ribs protruding, which he said looked like slats in a [[picket fence]]. Gill was from then on known as \"Slats.\"<ref name=\"Welsch\">Jeff Welsch and George P. Edmonston Jr., ''Tales from Oregon State Sports.''

This limestone outcrop is surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger [[Sandstone|sandstones]] ([[Gritstone|gritstones]]) and [[Shale|shales]]. Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region. The layers of [[Carboniferous Limestone|carboniferous limestone]] were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Vis\u00e9an|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). These deposits were compressed into rocks which over time were uplifted and folded into a dome. Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone [[Stratum|strata]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=John|title=The Book of Buxton|publisher=Baracuda Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=0 86023 286 7|location=|pages=14-15, 83-91}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLimestone has been quarried as building stone in the Buxton area for centuries.\n\nLime (also known as [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]) is produced easily by heating limestone and it has been used for thousands of years. [[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Grin Low ===\n[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]\nGrin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th-19th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commisioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill (which was operated until its closure in 1952). In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nGrin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole\u2019s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650. The opening of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] in 1831 generated expansion of quarrying around Buxton, with 4 new quarries: [[Harpur Hill Quarry]] in 1835, Perseverance in 1847, and Holderness and Bold Venture in 1857 at Dove Holes.\n\n=== Brunner Mond ===\nIn 1861 Belgian chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed the [[Solvay process]] (also called the ammonia-soda process) for the production of [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] (sodium carbonate) from salt brine and limestone. Soda ash (or washing soda) was used for producing soaps, for dying textiles and for making glass.\n\nThe [[Brunner Mond]] company was formed in 1873 by [[Sir John Brunner, 1st Baronet|John Brunner]] and [[Ludwig Mond]]. In 1874 they started using the Solvay process for the making soda ash at [[Winnington]] works in [[Northwich]], from the large local salt deposits and with limestone from Derbyshire. The soda ash was needed for the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry and for glass manufacture in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Brunner,_Mond_and_Co|title=Brunner, Mond and Co - Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgthome.co.uk/SGTNews/2004/SGTN04_15-18.pdf|title=ALKALIS FOR THE ST HELENS GLASSMAKER THROUGH THE AGES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=Society of Glass Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Buxton Lime Firms ===\n[[File:Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington 1964.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Limestone%20train%20from%20Tunstead%20to%20ICI%20Winnington%201964.jpg|thumb|'''Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington, 1964''']]\nThe arrival of the main railway lines from [[Manchester]] and [[London]] to Buxton in the 1860s prompted the opening of many further quarries: Victory in 1863, Ashwood Dale in 1864, Great Rocks in 1869, Peak Dale in 1877, Oldham Lime in 1878, East Buxton in 1880, Hindlow in 1882 and Buxton Central in 1885.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBuxton Lime Firms (BLF) was formed by 13 competing quarry owners in 1891.

It produced 360,000 tons of limestone and 280,000 tons of lime per year. Larger, more advanced kilns were now in use and firebricks were introduced into kilns from 1907. By 1915 BLF had developed or acquired an additional 9 quarries including the opening of: Small Dale in 1891, Dowlow in 1898, Buxton South in 1900, Topley Pike in 1907, Brierlow in 1907, Cowdale in 1908.

This limestone outcrop is surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger [[Sandstone|sandstones]] ([[Gritstone|gritstones]]) and [[Shale|shales]]. Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region. The layers of [[Carboniferous Limestone|carboniferous limestone]] were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Vis\u00e9an|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). These deposits were compressed into rocks which over time were uplifted and folded into a dome. Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone [[Stratum|strata]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=John|title=The Book of Buxton|publisher=Baracuda Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=0 86023 286 7|location=|pages=14-15, 83-91}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLimestone has been quarried as building stone in the Buxton area for centuries.\n\nLime (also known as [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]) is produced easily by heating limestone and it has been used for thousands of years. [[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime poweder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Grin Low ===\n[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]\nGrin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th-19th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill, which was operated until its closure in 1952. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commisioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nGrin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole\u2019s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650. The opening of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] in 1831 generated expansion of quarrying around Buxton, with 4 new quarries: [[Harpur Hill Quarry]] in 1835, Perseverance in 1847, and Holderness and Bold Venture in 1857 at Dove Holes.\n\n=== Brunner Mond ===\nIn 1861 Belgian chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed the [[Solvay process]] (also called the ammonia-soda process) for the production of [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] (sodium carbonate) from salt brine and limestone. Soda ash (or washing soda) was used to make soaps, for dying textiles and for making glass.\n\nThe [[Brunner Mond]] company was formed in 1873 by [[Sir John Brunner, 1st Baronet|John Brunner]] and [[Ludwig Mond]]. In 1874 they started using the Solvay process for the making soda ash at [[Winnington]] works in [[Northwich]], from the large local salt deposits and with limestone from Derbyshire. The soda ash was needed for the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry and for glass manufacture in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Brunner,_Mond_and_Co|title=Brunner, Mond and Co - Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgthome.co.uk/SGTNews/2004/SGTN04_15-18.pdf|title=ALKALIS FOR THE ST HELENS GLASSMAKER THROUGH THE AGES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=Society of Glass Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Buxton Lime Firms ===\n[[File:Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington 1964.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Limestone%20train%20from%20Tunstead%20to%20ICI%20Winnington%201964.jpg|thumb|'''Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington, 1964''']]\nThe arrival of the main railway lines from Manchester and London to Buxton in the 1860s prompted the opening of many further quarries: Victory in 1863, Ashwood Dale in 1864, Great Rocks in 1869, Peak Dale in 1877, Oldham Lime in 1878, East Buxton in 1880, Hindlow in 1882 and Buxton Central in 1885.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBuxton Lime Firms (BLF) was formed by 13 competing quarry owners in 1891.

It produced 360,000 tons of limestone and 280,000 tons of lime per year. More advanced kilns were now in use and firebricks were introduced into kilns from 1907.

In times of war, arms worn on the Nihang's person would generally be reserved until the warrior lost the weapon he held, often a bow or spear (''barsha''). Armour consisted of ''sanjo'' or iron chainmail worn under an iron breastplate (''char aina''). Nihang war-shoes (''jangi mozeh'') were constructed of iron at the toe, making their pointed toes capable of inflicting cuts and stab wounds.\n\nThe Nihang were particularly famous for their high turbans (''dastar bunga'') and their extensive use of the [[chakram]] or war-quoit.

In times of war, arms worn on the Nihang's person would generally be reserved until the warrior lost the weapon he held, often a bow or spear (''barsha''). Armour consisted of ''sanjo'' or iron chainmail worn under an iron breastplate (''char aina''). Nihang war-shoes (''jangi mozeh'') were constructed of iron at the toe, making their pointed toes capable of inflicting cuts and stab wounds.\n\nThe Nihang were particularly famous for their high turbans (''dastar bunga'') and their extensive use of the [[chakram]] or war-quoit. Their turbans were often pointed at the top and outfitted with a chand torra or trident which could be used for stabbing in close-quarters. Other times, the turbans would be armed with a [[bagh naka]] (iron claw) and one or several [[chakram]] to slice at an opponent's eyes. These steel-reinforced turbans, it was said, afforded enough protection so that there was no need for any other form of headgear. Today, Nihang still wear miniature versions of five weapons (''pancha shastra'') in their turbans, namely the [[chakram]], the [[khanda (sword)]], the ''karud'' (dagger), the [[kirpan]], and the ''tir'' (arrow).\n\n== Nihang today ==\n[[File:Group of Nihang Singhs.jpg|thumb|A group of Nihang]]\n\nNihang today are accorded great respect and affection by sections of the Sikh community, but they have  separate beliefs and certain practices.
