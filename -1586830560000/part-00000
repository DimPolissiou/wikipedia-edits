Said law mandated the establishment of a local constitution due to [[political status of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico's political status]] as a [[commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth of the United States]]. Ultimately, the powers of the government of [[Puerto Rico]] are all delegated by [[United States Congress|Congress]] and lack full protection under the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. Because of this, the [[head of state]] of Puerto Rico is the [[President of the United States]].\n\nStructurally, the government is composed of three branches: the [[executive branch of the government of Puerto Rico|executive]], [[legislative branch of the government of Puerto Rico|legislative]], and [[judicial branch of the government of Puerto Rico|judicial branch]]. The [[executive branch of the government of Puerto Rico|executive branch]] is headed by [[Governor of Puerto Rico|the governor]], currently [[Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced]], who is also the [[head of government]]. The [[legislative branch of the government of Puerto Rico|legislative branch]] consists of a [[bicameral]] legislature, namely the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico|Legislative Assembly]], composed by [[Senate of Puerto Rico|the Senate]] as its [[upper house]] and by the [[House of Representatives of Puerto Rico|House of Representatives]] as its [[lower house]]. The governor and legislators [[Elections in Puerto Rico|are elected by popular vote every four years]].\n\nThe [[judicial branch of the government of Puerto Rico|judicial branch]] is headed by the [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico]], currently [[j\u2013uan ponce d\u2032e le\u2032on]]. The legal system is a mix of the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and the [[common law]] systems. Members of the judicial branch are appointed by the governor with [[advice and consent]] from the Senate.\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of Puerto Rico}}\nPuerto Rico was ceded to the United States by [[Spain]] at the end of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]]. The [[Foraker Act]] of 1900 provided for an organization of the civilian government. The [[Jones\u2013Shafroth Act]] of 1917 re-organized the government.\n\nThe [[Federal Government of the United States|United States government]] authorized Puerto Rico to draft its own [[constitution]] by {{USStatute|81|600|64|319|1950|07|03}}. On 4 June 1951 the Puerto Ricans voted to hold a constitutional convention in a referendum, and elected delegates on 27 August 1951.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Puerto Rico: A New Constitution in American Government | first= Gordon K | last= Lewis | journal= [[The Journal of Politics]] | volume= 15 | issue= 1 | pages= 42\u201366 | date= February 1953 | jstor= 2126192 | ref= harv | doi= 10.2307/2126192}}</ref>{{sfn|Lewis|1953|p=43}} The convention adopted a constitution on 6 February 1952 and was ratified by Puerto Rico's electorate in [[Puerto Rican constitutional referendum, 1952|a referendum on March 3, 1952]].{{sfn|Lewis|1953|pp=43-44}}\n\nThe United States government approved an amended version by {{USStatute|82|447|66|327|1952|07|03}}, and on July 10, 1952 the Constitutional Convention of Puerto Rico reconvened and approved the conditions established by {{USPL|82|447}}. On July 25, 1952, Governor [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn]] proclaimed that the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] was in effect.\n\n==Executive branch==\n{{main article|Executive branch of the government of Puerto Rico}}\nThe executive branch is responsible for administering public resources, as well as providing all necessary public services to the Puerto Rican general public. It is by far the largest branch in the government as well as the largest employer in Puerto Rico with more than 150,000 workers.\n\n===Governor===\n{{Main article|Governor of Puerto Rico}}\n{{See also|List of governors of Puerto Rico}}\n\nThe [[head of government]] is the Governor of Puerto Rico, who is elected every four years in a general election. The position is similar in nature, responsibility, and power as those of a [[Governor#United States|governor of a U.S. state]]. The position of Governor has the overall responsibility of the state of the commonwealth, equivalent to the state of the union in the U.S. The official residence of the governor is [[La Fortaleza]], the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe Governor has the authority to nominate agency heads, trial and appellate [[judge]]s, as well as Supreme Court [[justice]]s and directors of public corporations, although these must be confirmed by the Senate and, in a handful of cases, the House, as well. Similar to a U.S. State, the Governor has authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard.\n\nAlthough Puerto Rico does not have the position of [[Lieutenant Governor]], sections 7 and 8 of the Constitution empower the Secretary of the Puerto Rico State Department to act as Acting Governor, should the governor be absent from Puerto Rico, become temporarily disabled or unable to discharge his/her duties, and as Governor for the remainder of the term should a permanent vacancy occur.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\n{{main article|Puerto Rico Chief of Staff}}\n\nPuerto Rico does not have a post for [[lieutenant governor]] but the [[Puerto Rico Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] performs a similar role as the officer charged with managing and overseeing all executive agencies. The Chief of Staff, however, is not empowered to act as [[acting governor]]&mdash;the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] and [[Puerto Rican law]] establishes a [[Puerto Rico governmental line of succession|governmental line of succession]] starting with the [[Secretary of State of Puerto Rico|Secretary of State]].\n\n===Acting Governor===\n{{main article|Secretary of State of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico governmental line of succession}}\n[[Article Four of the Constitution of Puerto Rico|Article IV]] of the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] establishes that the [[Secretary of State of Puerto Rico|Secretary of State]] should serve as [[acting governor]] when the Governor is not available. The [[Constitution of Puerto Rico|Constitution]] and [[Puerto Rican law]] establishes a [[Puerto Rico governmental line of succession|governmental line of succession]] for special cases when neither the Governor nor the Secretary are available.\n\n===Cabinet===\n{{Main article|Cabinet of Puerto Rico}}\n[[Article Four of the Constitution of Puerto Rico|Article IV]] of the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] establishes that the Governor shall be assisted by [[Minister (government)|Secretaries]] who shall collectively constitute the Governor's [[Adviser|advisory council]] and be designated as the ''Council of Secretaries'' although it's mostly referred to as the ''Cabinet''.\n\nThe Cabinet is composed by the '''Constitutional Cabinet''', composed by the Secretaries established by the Constitution, and the '''Operational Cabinet''', composed by the Secretaries established by extraconstitutional [[Puerto Rican law]] or appointed by the Governor. These Cabinets do not exist as agencies, but are referred as such in transcripts, records, official documents, and conversations for brevity and easiness.\n\nAll Cabinet members are nominated by the [[Governor of Puerto Rico|Governor]] and then presented to the [[Senate of Puerto Rico|Senate]] for [[advise and consent]] by a [[Majority|simple majority]]. If they are approved, they are sworn in and then begin their duties. All members receive the title of ''Secretary''.\n\nMembers of the Cabinet serve at the pleasure of the Governor, who may dismiss them or reappoint them (to other posts) at will.\n\n===Executive departments===\n{{Main article|Executive departments of the government of Puerto Rico}}\n[[File:Puerto Rico State Department.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|The main offices of the [[Puerto Rico Department of State]] in front of [[Plaza de Armas, San Juan|Plaza de Armas]] in [[Old San Juan]].]]\nThe day-to-day enforcement and administration of laws is delegated by the Governor to 16 [[Executive Departments of the Government of Puerto Rico|executive departments]] created by the Constitution or by statute to deal with specific areas of government. The heads of the departments, chosen by the governor and approved by the Senate (with the exception of the Secretary of State, who requires Senate and House confirmation), form a council of advisers generally known as the Governor's Cabinet.\n\nThe Constitution provides for the creation of at least 8 departments: Departments of [[Puerto Rico Department of State|State]], [[Puerto Rico Department of Justice|Justice]], [[Puerto Rico Department of Education|Education]], [[Puerto Rico Department of Health|Health]], [[Puerto Rico Department of Treasury|Treasury]], [[Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources|Labor]], [[Department of Agriculture of Puerto Rico|Agriculture]], [[Puerto Rico Department of Economic Development and Commerce|Commerce]], and [[Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works|Public Works]]. However, due to the increase in population, economy, and public needs over the years, the Puerto Rico government has expanded the executive branch by establishing additional executive departments not specified in the Constitution. These additional departments are established by public law or so-called \"reorganization plans\", as approved by the legislative assembly.\n\nThe title of [[Secretary]] is given to the heads of the executive departments, whose position is also created by statute. Cabinet member is another title primarily given by the media and the public, though it is considered unofficial. All cabinet-level Secretaries are first nominated by the Governor and are confirmed by the legislative assembly.\n\nEach department has different [[division (organization)|division]]s, [[Government agency|agencies]], [[Government agency|bureaus]], [[office]]s, and [[Public services|service]]s, each with specific duties, in order to provide the necessary services to the general public across the island.\n\n=== Government-owned corporations ===\n{{Main|List of government-owned corporations of Puerto Rico}}\n\nPuerto Rico has also established several government-owned corporations in order to provide basic and public services to its citizens, including electricity, water, transportation, and education, among others. These are separate legal entities from the Commonwealth, but the government owns virtually all of these corporations's [[stock]]. Each corporation is headed by an Executive Director who is appointed by the corporations\u2019 [[Board of Directors]]. The directors are nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the state legislative assembly.\n\nAlthough government-owned corporations are separate from the commonwealth government, who generate their income and expenses independently, several of those have faced financial troubles, and have constantly relied on so called \u201cbail-outs\u201d from the commonwealth to offset recurring losses and deficits, and have been unable to [[Puerto Rican government-debt crisis#Bankruptcy|legally declare bankruptcy]].\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main article|Legislative branch of the government of Puerto Rico|Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico}}\n\n[[File:Puerto Rico Capitol.JPG|thumb|left|South view of the Puerto Rico Capitol, home of the Legislative Assembly.]][[Article Three of the Constitution of Puerto Rico|Article III]] of the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] grants all legislative powers of the national government to the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico]], which is divided into two chambers: a 27-member [[Senate of Puerto Rico|Senate]] and a 51-member [[House of Representatives of Puerto Rico|House of Representatives]]. The chambers are presided over by the [[President of the Senate of Puerto Rico|President of the Senate]] and the [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico|Speaker of the House]], respectively. Both positions are occupied by an active member of each body, elected by a majority of both chambers. The current heads are Senator [[Eduardo Bhatia]] and Representative [[Jaime Perell\u00f3 Borr\u00e1s]], respectively.\n\nMembers are elected to both chambers in [[Elections in Puerto Rico|general elections]] held every four years, along with the elections for the Governor and [[mayors of Puerto Rico|the 78 municipal mayors]]. Each member of the Legislative Assembly represents an [[electoral district]], with the exception of a number of legislators who are considered [[at-large]] and represent the island as a whole. Members representing specific districts are elected by the citizens residing within the district, while at-large legislators are elected by accumulation of all island votes.\n\n===Constitutional changes===\n\nIn recent years, two referendums have been held to propose constitutional changes to substantially modify the composition of the Legislative Assembly.\n\nVarious organizations pushed for changing the legislative assembly from the current two-chamber system (House and Senate) prevalent in 49 of the 50 states of the nation to one-chamber ([[unicameralism]]). The reasons for this proposed change was based on the growing public opinion that members of the assembly are overpaid, and that a smaller assembly might achieve the same work results as the bicameral one with less public expenditures. However, an official report of 1995 indicates that this argument should not be considered the primary objective because the savings are not significant. The legislative spending in Puerto Rico, compared with the consolidated government budget is less than 1% of total government spending.<ref>http://www.oslpr.org/spanish/PDF/Unicameralidad.pdf</ref>\n\nLacking the two-thirds majority necessary in both houses of the Legislature to submit constitutional amendments to the electorate, in 2004 the Popular Democratic Party's then-majority approved legislation to hold a [[Puerto Rican unicameralism referendum, 2005|referendum]], not on a particular constitutional amendment as such, but on the general concept of switching from a bicameral to a unicameral system which was held on July 10, 2005. Attended  by less than 25% of the islands' electorate, Puerto Rican voters approved the change to a [[unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] by 456,267 votes in favor, versus 88,720 against.<ref>{{cite news|author = Mar\u00eda Vera|title = Trabajan borrador unicameralidad|publisher = [[El Vocero]]|url = http://www.vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&n=78249|accessdate = 2006-10-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182019/http://www.vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&n=78249 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> ([[Voter turnout]] was 22.6% of the electorate.)<ref>{{cite web|title = La Participaci\u00f3n Ciudadana en los Procesos Electorales en Puerto Rico|work = Oficina de Asuntos Legales|publisher = Comisi\u00f3n Estatal de Elecciones de Puerto Rico (CEEPUR) / State Electoral Commission|url = http://www.ceepur.org/sobreCee/leyElectoral/pdf/LaParticipacicion.pdf|accessdate = 2006-10-02|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061004193306/http://www.ceepur.org/sobreCee/leyElectoral/pdf/LaParticipacicion.pdf|archivedate = 2006-10-04}} (via {{cite web |url=http://www.ceepur.org/sobreCee/leyElectoral/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206040957/http://www.ceepur.org/sobreCee/leyElectoral/ |archivedate=2004-12-06 }})</ref> Almost four years later, incoming Governor [[Luis Fortu\u00f1o]]  (from the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party or New Party of Progress (NPP)]]) discarded the alternative of unicameralism claiming that the NPP's platform, rather than advocating unicameralism, supported submitting to the people a constitutional amendment proposing a substantial reduction in seats in the existing bicameral legislature.<ref>[http://www.wapa.tv/noticias/politica/derrotada-otra-vez-la-unicamara_20090122181536.html Derrotada otra vez la unicamara] on [[WAPA-TV]] (January 22, 2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.primerahora.com/danvueltaalapagina-267390.html Dan vuelta a la p\u00e1gina] on ''[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]]''; D\u00edaz Alcaide, Maritza (January 22, 2009)</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Governor Fortu\u00f1o proposed, and by a two thirds majority in both houses, the Legislature approved submitting to the people a constitutional amendment reducing the size of the House from 51 to 39 seats and the Senate from 27 to 17 seats, essentially a 30% reduction in size.

The municipalities also have a municipal legislature, which is in charge of overseeing the mayor's operations, holding public meetings, and enacting municipal resolutions and ordinances. Both the mayor and the municipal legislators are elected at-large by the municipality's citizens in general elections held every four years. Unlike most towns and cities in the United States., Puerto Rico does not have local or state sheriffs, sheriff duties are instead performed by the Puerto Rico Commonwealth Marshal's Office.

Similar to a U.S. State, the Governor has authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard.\n\nAlthough Puerto Rico does not have the position of [[Lieutenant Governor]], sections 7 and 8 of the Constitution empower the Secretary of the Puerto Rico State Department to act as Acting Governor, should the governor be absent from Puerto Rico, become temporarily disabled or unable to discharge his/her duties, and as Governor for the remainder of the term should a permanent vacancy occur.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\n{{main article|Puerto Rico Chief of Staff}}\n\nPuerto Rico does not have a post for [[lieutenant governor]] but the [[Puerto Rico Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] performs a similar role as the officer charged with managing and overseeing all executive agencies. The Chief of Staff, however, is not empowered to act as [[acting governor]]&mdash;the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] and [[Puerto Rican law]] establishes a [[Puerto Rico governmental line of succession|governmental line of succession]] starting with the [[Secretary of State of Puerto Rico|Secretary of State]].\n\n===Acting Governor===\n{{main article|Secretary of State of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico governmental line of succession}}\n[[Article Four of the Constitution of Puerto Rico|Article IV]] of the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] establishes that the [[Secretary of State of Puerto Rico|Secretary of State]] should serve as [[acting governor]] when the Governor is not available. The [[Constitution of Puerto Rico|Constitution]] and [[Puerto Rican law]] establishes a [[Puerto Rico governmental line of succession|governmental line of succession]] for special cases when neither the Governor nor the Secretary are available.\n\n===Cabinet===\n{{Main article|Cabinet of Puerto Rico}}\n[[Article Four of the Constitution of Puerto Rico|Article IV]] of the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] establishes that the Governor shall be assisted by [[Minister (government)|Secretaries]] who shall collectively constitute the Governor's [[Adviser|advisory council]] and be designated as the ''Council of Secretaries'' although it's mostly referred to as the ''Cabinet''.\n\nThe Cabinet is composed by the '''Constitutional Cabinet''', composed by the Secretaries established by the Constitution, and the '''Operational Cabinet''', composed by the Secretaries established by extraconstitutional [[Puerto Rican law]] or appointed by the Governor. These Cabinets do not exist as agencies, but are referred as such in transcripts, records, official documents, and conversations for brevity and easiness.\n\nAll Cabinet members are nominated by the [[Governor of Puerto Rico|Governor]] and then presented to the [[Senate of Puerto Rico|Senate]] for [[advise and consent]] by a [[Majority|simple majority]]. If they are approved, they are sworn in and then begin their duties. All members receive the title of ''Secretary''.\n\nMembers of the Cabinet serve at the pleasure of the Governor, who may dismiss them or reappoint them (to other posts) at will.\n\n===Executive departments===\n{{Main article|Executive departments of the government of Puerto Rico}}\n[[File:Puerto Rico State Department.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|The main offices of the [[Puerto Rico Department of State]] in front of [[Plaza de Armas, San Juan|Plaza de Armas]] in [[Old San Juan]].]]\nThe day-to-day enforcement and administration of laws is delegated by the Governor to 16 [[Executive Departments of the Government of Puerto Rico|executive departments]] created by the Constitution or by statute to deal with specific areas of government. The heads of the departments, chosen by the governor and approved by the Senate (with the exception of the Secretary of State, who requires Senate and House confirmation), form a council of advisers generally known as the Governor's Cabinet.\n\nThe Constitution provides for the creation of at least 8 departments: Departments of [[Puerto Rico Department of State|State]], [[Puerto Rico Department of Justice|Justice]], [[Puerto Rico Department of Education|Education]], [[Puerto Rico Department of Health|Health]], [[Puerto Rico Department of Treasury|Treasury]], [[Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources|Labor]], [[Department of Agriculture of Puerto Rico|Agriculture]], [[Puerto Rico Department of Economic Development and Commerce|Commerce]], and [[Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works|Public Works]]. However, due to the increase in population, economy, and public needs over the years, the Puerto Rico government has expanded the executive branch by establishing additional executive departments not specified in the Constitution. These additional departments are established by public law or so-called \"reorganization plans\", as approved by the legislative assembly.\n\nThe title of [[Secretary]] is given to the heads of the executive departments, whose position is also created by statute. Cabinet member is another title primarily given by the media and the public, though it is considered unofficial. All cabinet-level Secretaries are first nominated by the Governor and are confirmed by the legislative assembly.\n\nEach department has different [[division (organization)|division]]s, [[Government agency|agencies]], [[Government agency|bureaus]], [[office]]s, and [[Public services|service]]s, each with specific duties, in order to provide the necessary services to the general public across the island.\n\n=== Government-owned corporations ===\n{{Main|List of government-owned corporations of Puerto Rico}}\n\nPuerto Rico has also established several government-owned corporations in order to provide basic and public services to its citizens, including electricity, water, transportation, and education, among others. These are separate legal entities from the Commonwealth, but the government owns virtually all of these corporations's [[stock]]. Each corporation is headed by an Executive Director who is appointed by the corporations\u2019 [[Board of Directors]]. The directors are nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the state legislative assembly.\n\nAlthough government-owned corporations are separate from the commonwealth government, who generate their income and expenses independently, several of those have faced financial troubles, and have constantly relied on so called \u201cbail-outs\u201d from the commonwealth to offset recurring losses and deficits, and have been unable to [[Puerto Rican government-debt crisis#Bankruptcy|legally declare bankruptcy]].\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main article|Legislative branch of the government of Puerto Rico|Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico}}\n\n[[File:Puerto Rico Capitol.JPG|thumb|left|South view of the Puerto Rico Capitol, home of the Legislative Assembly.]][[Article Three of the Constitution of Puerto Rico|Article III]] of the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] grants all legislative powers of the national government to the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico]], which is divided into two chambers: a 27-member [[Senate of Puerto Rico|Senate]] and a 51-member [[House of Representatives of Puerto Rico|House of Representatives]]. The chambers are presided over by the [[President of the Senate of Puerto Rico|President of the Senate]] and the [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico|Speaker of the House]], respectively. Both positions are occupied by an active member of each body, elected by a majority of both chambers. The current heads are Senator [[Eduardo Bhatia]] and Representative [[Jaime Perell\u00f3 Borr\u00e1s]], respectively.\n\nMembers are elected to both chambers in [[Elections in Puerto Rico|general elections]] held every four years, along with the elections for the Governor and [[mayors of Puerto Rico|the 78 municipal mayors]]. Each member of the Legislative Assembly represents an [[electoral district]], with the exception of a number of legislators who are considered [[at-large]] and represent the island as a whole. Members representing specific districts are elected by the citizens residing within the district, while at-large legislators are elected by accumulation of all island votes.\n\n===Constitutional changes===\n\nIn recent years, two referendums have been held to propose constitutional changes to substantially modify the composition of the Legislative Assembly.\n\nVarious organizations pushed for changing the legislative assembly from the current two-chamber system (House and Senate) prevalent in 49 of the 50 states of the nation to one-chamber ([[unicameralism]]). The reasons for this proposed change was based on the growing public opinion that members of the assembly are overpaid, and that a smaller assembly might achieve the same work results as the bicameral one with less public expenditures. However, an official report of 1995 indicates that this argument should not be considered the primary objective because the savings are not significant. The legislative spending in Puerto Rico, compared with the consolidated government budget is less than 1% of total government spending.<ref>http://www.oslpr.org/spanish/PDF/Unicameralidad.pdf</ref>\n\nLacking the two-thirds majority necessary in both houses of the Legislature to submit constitutional amendments to the electorate, in 2004 the Popular Democratic Party's then-majority approved legislation to hold a [[Puerto Rican unicameralism referendum, 2005|referendum]], not on a particular constitutional amendment as such, but on the general concept of switching from a bicameral to a unicameral system which was held on July 10, 2005. Attended  by less than 25% of the islands' electorate, Puerto Rican voters approved the change to a [[unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] by 456,267 votes in favor, versus 88,720 against.<ref>{{cite news|author = Mar\u00eda Vera|title = Trabajan borrador unicameralidad|publisher = [[El Vocero]]|url = http://www.vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&n=78249|accessdate = 2006-10-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182019/http://www.vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&n=78249 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> ([[Voter turnout]] was 22.6% of the electorate.)<ref>{{cite web|title = La Participaci\u00f3n Ciudadana en los Procesos Electorales en Puerto Rico|work = Oficina de Asuntos Legales|publisher = Comisi\u00f3n Estatal de Elecciones de Puerto Rico (CEEPUR) / State Electoral Commission|url = http://www.ceepur.org/sobreCee/leyElectoral/pdf/LaParticipacicion.pdf|accessdate = 2006-10-02|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061004193306/http://www.ceepur.org/sobreCee/leyElectoral/pdf/LaParticipacicion.pdf|archivedate = 2006-10-04}} (via {{cite web |url=http://www.ceepur.org/sobreCee/leyElectoral/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206040957/http://www.ceepur.org/sobreCee/leyElectoral/ |archivedate=2004-12-06 }})</ref> Almost four years later, incoming Governor [[Luis Fortu\u00f1o]]  (from the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party or New Party of Progress (NPP)]]) discarded the alternative of unicameralism claiming that the NPP's platform, rather than advocating unicameralism, supported submitting to the people a constitutional amendment proposing a substantial reduction in seats in the existing bicameral legislature.<ref>[http://www.wapa.tv/noticias/politica/derrotada-otra-vez-la-unicamara_20090122181536.html Derrotada otra vez la unicamara] on [[WAPA-TV]] (January 22, 2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.primerahora.com/danvueltaalapagina-267390.html Dan vuelta a la p\u00e1gina] on ''[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]]''; D\u00edaz Alcaide, Maritza (January 22, 2009)</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Governor Fortu\u00f1o proposed, and by a two thirds majority in both houses, the Legislature approved submitting to the people a constitutional amendment reducing the size of the House from 51 to 39 seats and the Senate from 27 to 17 seats, essentially a 30% reduction in size.

The Supreme Court, the commonwealth's highest court, holds its sessions in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan's]] [[Miramar, Puerto Rico|Miramar]] district.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Main article|Municipalities of Puerto Rico|Mayors of Puerto Rico}}\nPuerto Rico is divided into 78 divisions, each municipality headed by a mayor. The municipalities also have a municipal legislature, which is in charge of overseeing the mayor's operations, holding public meetings, and enacting municipal resolutions and ordinances. Both the mayor and the municipal legislators are elected at-large by the municipality's citizens in general elections held every four years. Unlike most towns and cities in the United States., Puerto Rico does not have local or state sheriffs, sheriff duties are instead performed by the Puerto Rico Commonwealth Marshal's Office.  Many municipalities have established municipal police departments, although most law enforcement activity is carried out by the Puerto Rico Police (PPR).\n\n==Government finances==\n{{main article|Puerto Rico government budget balance|Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico Consolidated Fund|Puerto Rico General Fund}}\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=November 2012}}\nPuerto Rico's central government, which includes all three branches of government but excludes public corporations and municipalities, has an annual general budget that currently ranges from $8.5 billion to $9 billion in revenues and expenditures.<ref name=\"PR_2005_budget\">[http://www.hacienda.gobierno.pr/downloads/pdf/cafr/FINANCIAL_REPORT_2005.pdf Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 2005 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report] for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2005; pg. 30; Statement of Revenues and Expenditures - Budget and Actual \u2013 Budget Basis \u2013 General Fund</ref> The government also receives more than $4.2 billion annually in [[subsidy|subsidies]] and [[federal aid]] from the United States.<ref name=\"PR_Op_and_Cap_Grants\">[http://www.hacienda.gobierno.pr/downloads/pdf/cafr/FINANCIAL_REPORT_2005.pdf Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 2005 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report] for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2005; pg. 24; Statement of Activities; Operating and Capital Grants and Contributions (columns)</ref> A substantial portion of this amount is earmarked for [[Public welfare in Puerto Rico|public welfare]], including funding educational programs (such as [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]]), subsidized housing programs (such as ([[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] and [[Public housing in Puerto Rico|public housing projects]]), and a [[Nutrition Assistance for Puerto Rico|food stamp]] system called the [[Nutrition Assistance for Puerto Rico]] program.\n\n[[List of government-owned corporations of Puerto Rico|Government-owned corporations]] generate approximately $6.3 billion in general revenues by charging citizens for the services they provide.
