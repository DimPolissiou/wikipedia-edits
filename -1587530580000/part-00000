However, the name is old ([[Old Norse]]: ''M\u0153rr''), and it is probably derived from the word ''marr'' which means \"[[ocean]]\" or \"sea\".  The meaning is then \"coastal district\". (A coastal district in [[Sweden]] has the same name: [[M\u00f6re]].)\n\nThe ambiguous designation ''m\u00f8ring''&mdash;\"person from M\u00f8re\"&mdash;is used strictly about people from Nordm\u00f8re (and less frequently for people from Sunnm\u00f8re), excluding the people from Romsdal (while, consequently, ''romsdaling''&mdash;\"person from Romsdal\"&mdash; is used about the latter).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.kirken.no/more Official website of the diocese] {{in lang|no}}\n\n{{Bishops of Norway}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diocese Of More}}\n[[Category:M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]\n[[Category:Church of Norway dioceses|More]]\n[[Category:Christian organizations established in 1983]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Molde]]\n[[Category:1983 establishments in Norway]]\n", "name_user": "Redriv", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStructure:deleted Alesund from Austre Sunnmore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_M%C3%B8re"}

With access to the internet and the fast-growing [[World Wide Web]], online social movements brought awareness to issues both political and social. Online social movements have been praised and criticized; the former for its ability to raise awareness to important causes, and the latter for its ability to perpetuate problems like [[slacktivism]]. Although online activism has received criticism, it has had real impacts on social movements.\n\n====== History of Online Social Movements ======\nThe earliest social movements were minimally related to the internet. For instance, Charles Tilly recognizes the first social movements in Britain and the US in the 1750s and 1760s, after the 7 Years War. [[John Wilkes]] led the \"Wilkes and Liberty\" movement to achieve legal and parliamentary reform. Across the Atlantic, the Boston merchants and the activists in the [[Sons of Liberty]] initiated the opposition to the British that eventually lead to the Declaration of Independence in 1776.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Tilly, Charles 1929-2008 Verfasser.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1126812829|title=Social movements, 1768-2018|isbn=978-0-367-07607-8|oclc=1126812829}}</ref>\n\nThe mentality behind these was spurred on by sovereignty within British politics through the Reformation and informed John Wilkes and his followers about alternative societal rule. Thus, in 1768, members of the English lower class began to mobilize underneath Wilkes\u2019 movement against the sovereignty of the ruling class.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Cash, Arthur.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/952732211|title=John Wilkes : the Scandalous Father of Civil Liberty.|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-10871-0|oclc=952732211}}</ref> On May 10, 1768, Wilkes\u2019 supporters and the king\u2019s soldiers at St. George\u2019s field began fighting, resulting in about six to eleven protesters dead.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Rudbeck|first=Jens|date=2012-10-05|title=Popular sovereignty and the historical origin of the social movement|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11186-012-9180-x|journal=Theory and Society|volume=41|issue=6|pages=581\u2013601|doi=10.1007/s11186-012-9180-x|issn=0304-2421}}</ref> This event sparked speculation about where sovereignty lies. The rise of the Wilkes movement marked the beginning of a new phase in British politics where the notion of popular sovereignty became dominant.<ref name=\":7\" /> Wilkes and his followers consistently challenged the leading authority through actions taken outside of parliament and on the basis of contesting laws. They created something that was so new that it laid the groundwork for political struggles to come: social movements.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThese situations, while different in nature from social movements we experience today, started the idea of mass-gathering to contest an issue. Modern examples of social movements include the Movement of the Unemployed in the 1930s, the Free Speech and Civil Rights Movements in the 1960s, the lower-profile 1990s movements and the many movements in the 21st century.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nSocial movements have evolved to a more dynamic, organized, effective, and prominent state than ever before, in part due to social movements presence on social media. The earliest online social movements began right after the Internet revolution. While the Arab Springs are commonly associated with the earliest online movements, in reality, social movements began through email. In 1990, software company [[Lotus 1-2-3|Lotus]] and credit bureau [[Equifax]] gained access to names, addresses and purchasing behavior of 120 million Americans in CD-ROM format. In response, nearly 30,000 consumers organised through emails and message boards in protest, halting the release of the database by 1991.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gurak, Laura J.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/40927039|title=Persuasion and privacy in cyberspace : the online protests over Lotus Marketplace and the Clipper Chip.|date=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-07864-1|oclc=40927039}}</ref>\n\nSince the late 2000s, there has been an increasing use of commercial social media platforms by social movements. According to Lopes, \"Social Media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and the various online blogs have arguably given a voice to individuals that otherwise would not be heard.\" <ref name=\":10\" />\n\nMany people have conflicting views on social media and its effectiveness when put to the task of activism. Interestingly, Pew Research Centre found that some 64% of Americans feel that the statement \u2018social media help give a voice to underrepresented groups\u2019 describes these sites very or somewhat well. But a larger share say social networking sites distract people from issues that are truly important (77% feel this way), and 71% agree with the assertion that \u2018social media makes people believe they\u2019re making a difference even when they really are not really making change.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/07/11/activism-in-the-social-media-age/|title=Activism in the Social Media Age|last=NW|first=1615 L.

movements has been substantial since the introduction of the internet. With the ever-growing medium of social media, internet activism has reached the forefront of the internet. Through the use of social networking sites such as [[Facebook]] and content-sharing sites as [[YouTube]], the opportunity for wide-scale, online social participation has increased.<ref>Rotman, D., Preece, J., Vieweg, S., Shneiderman, B., Yardi, S., Pirolli, P., Chi, E.H., Glaisyer, T. (2011). From Slacktivism to Activism: Participatory Culture in the Age of Social Media</ref>\n\n=== Benefits ===\n\nOnline social movements have been celebrated for their ability to amass large amounts of success. The online world provides the power to organise without any formal organisations, which speeds up the process of mobilisation and allows for greater scale in rapid time frames.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shirky, Clay.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/883359654|title=Here comes everybody : the power of organizing without organizations|date=2014|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-1-4406-3224-2|oclc=883359654}}</ref> This can be understood as New Power, which supports informal leadership and radical transparency, conducive for large amounts of participation by people on social media.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Heimans|first=Jeremy|url=https://hbr.org/2014/12/understanding-new-power|title=Understanding \"New Power\"|date=2014-12-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2020-04-14|last2=Timms|first2=Henry|issue=December 2014|issn=0017-8012}}</ref> Previously, the dominant form of old power limited participation in movements and leadership to a small group.<ref name=\":0\" /> Rapid mobilisation helps people overcome pluralistic ignorance, where individuals believe that they are the only person with a particular view. Instead, the online networked sphere helps reveal otherwise preferences to each other in order to discover common ground.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|last=TUFEKCI, ZEYNEP.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1002689516|title=TWITTER AND TEAR GAS : the power and fragility of networked protest.|date=2018|publisher=YALE University Press|isbn=0-300-23417-1|oclc=1002689516}}</ref>\u00a0 The increased visibility of a movement on the internet supports a sense of camaraderie, setting and maintaining a cause, even if it is otherwise decentralised.

The online world enables the synchronisation of opinions across disparate geographies, creating new norms of behavior and belief through regular repetition and affirmation of messages.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the political sphere, active online groups increase political participation by providing a framework for discussion, leading petitions, and collecting donations in order to further a political agenda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/brief/how-social-movements-are-using-internet-change-politics|title=How Social Movements are Using the Internet to Change Politics {{!}} Scholars Strategy Network|website=www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref> This alignment of values has often results in the potential to organise, such as fund raising in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge that raised $100 million in just 30 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alsa.org/news/media/press-releases/ice-bucket-challenge-082914.html|title=The ALS Association Expresses Sincere Gratitude to Over Three Million Donors|website=ALSA.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}</ref>\nOnline movements are able to sustain attention across boundaries, physical and temporal. For instance, during the Egyptian Revolution in 2011, Facebook\u2019s event function allowed for people to organise protests, which would then be acted out upon in real-life. Similarly, the Occupy movement was able to gather an online following around the world through the Tumblr blog, titled \u201cWe are the 99%\u201d. The function of being able to post on a shared website supported the gathering of different narratives, unifying people. In fact, online social movements epitomises the notion of \u201cmany yeses, one no\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> This motto highlights how the online world brings together diverse voices against something they all feel strongly about, by acting as integrating screens since people use these devices to connect with others, rather than to isolate themselves. In many ways, social media has created networks conducive for unification across different identities, supporting intersectional approaches to fighting injustice. For instance, the [[Zapatistas]] attempted to emphasise their inclusivity of the movement, which had begun as somewhat of a peasants revolt. The leader of the movement, Marcos, was famously presented in numerous identities, of different exploited and marginalised minorities who are saying \u201cEnough\u201d to their situation:<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Marcos|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/professionals-of-hope-the-selected-writings-of-subcomandante-marcos/oclc/1004260843|title=Professionals of hope: the selected writings of Subcomandante Marcos|last2=Jauregui|first2=Gabriela|date=2017|isbn=978-0-9967786-5-7|oclc=1004260843}}</ref><blockquote>\u201cYes, Marcos is gay. Marcos is gay in San Francisco, black in South Africa, an Asian in Europe, a Chicano in San Ysidro, an anarchist in Spain, a Palestinian in Israel, a Mayan Indian in the streets of San Cristobal, a Jew in Germany, a Gypsy in Poland, a Mohawk in Quebec, a pacifist in Bosnia, a single woman on the subway at 10pm, a peasant without land, a gang member in the slums, an unemployed worker, an unhappy student and, of course, a Zapatista in the mountains. Marcos is all the exploited, marginalised, oppressed minorities resisting and saying 'Enough.' He is every minority who is now beginning to speak, and every majority that must shut up and listen. He is every untolerated group searching for a way to speak. Everything that makes power and the good consciences of those in power uncomfortable\u2014this is Marcos.\u201d -Subcommandant Marcos, from Social Justice E-Zine #27 <ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>Social media is also able to provide a creative milieu that is conducive for narrative building. Memes, in particular, have proven to be a useful tool when it comes to repeat certain ideas so that they enter the public consciousness and are able to retain attention. Often, the large numbers of people online allow for intentional overproduction.<ref name=\":2\" /> Amanda D. Lotz noted that this is a key strategy, where multiple shows and commercials are created in order to compete, so that the most effective version can succeed, while the others disappear.<ref name=\":2\" /> In online social movements, hashtag culture functions by having many people copy each other and come up with new permutations, allowing for the most successful version to spread.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSocial media platforms are harder to censor than real-life organisation of movements. Ethan Zuckerman advanced the [[Cute cat theory of digital activism|Cute Cat Theory of Digital Activism]], which explains the relative lack of censorship online. Zuckerman posits that the web is used primarily for innocuous purposes, such as connecting with families and friends and posting pictures of cats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/12/03/cute-cat-theory-the-china-corollary/|title=Cute Cat Theory: The China Corollary {{!}} \u2026 My heart\u2019s in Accra|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, the affordances that social media provides activists nurtures a community that engages in political criticism. Still, these activists are able to hide behind the largely mundane uses of the internet, since censorship by governments would appear especially draconian. For instance, the Twitter ban in Turkey by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan who intended to \u201cwipe out\u201d the social media platform was met with furious outrage from the population, experts and the global community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-election-idUSBREA2K0NK20140321|title=Furious reaction, political split after Turkey bans Twitter|date=2014-03-21|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en}}</ref> Similarly when ex-Tunisian President Ben Ali attempted to ban Facebook in 2010, his move backfired because so many Tunisians used Facebook to connect with family, friends and acquaintances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/01/12/the-limits-of-silencing-tunisia/|title=The limits of silencing Tunisia|last=Bounenni|first=Bassam|website=Foreign Policy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Detriments ===\n\nNevertheless, there are numerous critiques posed against online social movements.\n\nMost frequently, the limited capacity for tangible change is often raised. For social movements to be successful, there need to be network internalities, which are durable networks ideal for organised action.<ref name=\":2\" /> These networks are the result of long-term challenges that are collectively overcome, which supports trust building. This process requires the investment of time and energy in order for members of a social movement to learn how to cooperate to achieve their goals.\n\nZeynep Tufekci introduces the Mount Everest metaphor in her comparison of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]\u2019s achievements with the [[Arab Spring]]\u2019s relative limited scope of change, especially in Egypt.<ref name=\":2\" /> Zeynep draws a comparison between social media and Sherpas. Previously, climbing Mount Everest was a challenging task. However, with Sherpas, more people were capable of doing so, and this led to a spike in mountaineering tourism. Nevertheless, these individuals remained unprepared for the reality of scaling the mountain, resulting in a spike in deaths. Similarly, social media has enabled more social movements to spread and enter the public sphere. However, there has not been long-term training and building of network internalities which is necessary to sustain these movements.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Civil Rights Movement had undergone strenuous planning and organisation, which has resulted in leaders who were able to represent the cause, such as Martin Luther King. In contrast, online social movements tend to be more short-lived. For instance, [[Kony 2012]] brought attention to child soldiers being forced into Joseph Kony\u2019s [[Lord\u2019s Resistance Army]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/problem-stop-kony/330661/|title=The Problems with 'Stop Kony'|last=Abad-Santos|first=Alexander|date=2012-03-08|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, the small organisation that directed the video, Invisible Children, was incapable of managing the sheer volume of attention received. Without the network internalities present in the Civil Rights Movement, the director [[Jason Russell]] had a major breakdown and the social movement dissipated.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Curtis|first=Polly|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/kony-2012-nirvana-missed-chance|title=Kony 2012: nirvana of online campaigning or missed chance?|date=2012-04-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThere is also the concern of a lack of clear leadership in online social movements. This means that there might be a challenge in finding representatives to negotiate within the movement and with adversaries. These individuals might have little in common beyond the initial movement. For instance, [[Tahrir Square]] protesters could not deviate tactically from their initial demand, which was to overthrow the Hosni Mubarak regime. Hence, there was a tactical freeze, where tactics could not be adjusted and new demands were not articulated by the social movement. Even the creator of \u201cWe are All Khaled Said\u201d, the main Facebook page of the Egyptian Revolution, Wael Ghonim was in no position to concede anything. Ghonim was neither an elected leader, nor an informal one, which denied him legitimacy to engage in negotiations.<ref name=\":2\" /> Similarly, in the [[Occupy movement]], there was an attempt to empower all protestors to be leaders of the movement. However, as a \u201cleaderful\u201d movement, there was a lack of ability to identify a clear representative to negotiate since there were too many perspectives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Costanza-Chock|first=Sasha|date=2012-08-01|title=Mic Check! Media Cultures and the Occupy Movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2012.710746|journal=Social Movement Studies|volume=11|issue=3-4|pages=375\u2013385|doi=10.1080/14742837.2012.710746|issn=1474-2837}}</ref>\n\nOnline social movements, while effective in unifying people, might also amplify the tendency to tribalism. In particular, more people having access to social media might democratise the risk of promoting violence, especially where institutions are not stable and there can be large amounts of distrust and disinformation. For instance, while social media had helped Sri Lanka ease the path to its first democratic elections in 2015 after years of civil war, communal hatreds began to overrun the news feeds, which are the primary portal of news and information for many users.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Taub|first=Amanda|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/world/asia/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html|title=Where Countries Are Tinderboxes and Facebook Is a Match|date=2018-04-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-14|last2=Fisher|first2=Max|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nSome critiques, specific to online social media activism, have been raised about the power mechanisms and organisational tructure.  This transition highlighted asymmetrical relationships between the for-profit aims of social media and the copy-left values that drive many online movements. According to Fenton, \"Claims for the extension and re-invention of activism need to be considered in the context of the material social and political world of inequality, injustice and corporate dominance.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> For example, \"in his analysis of the [[Purple People|Purple Movemen]]<nowiki/>t (Popolo Viola) in Italy and its extensive use of Facebook, Coretti (2014)<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite thesis|title=The Purple Movement: Social Media and Activism in Berlusconi\u2019s Italy|url=https://westminsterresearch.westminster.ac.uk/item/964wx/the-purple-movement-social-media-and-activism-in-berlusconi-s-italy|publisher=University of Westminster|date=2014|degree=doctoral|language=en|first=L.|last=Coretti}}</ref> demonstrates that, while the myth of the network as open and inclusive persists, it acts as a disguise for the communication protocols of commercial social networking platforms that may well enable large-scale mobilization but ultimately, through their very functionality, encourage organizational centralization and fragmentation in social movements\" <ref name=\":9\" />. The proprietary nature of the design of platforms, such as Facebook pages, possibly fails to provide movements with the necessary instruments in a shared democratic management of their resources. Moreover, the inability to manage Facebook pages and groups according to commonly agreed values promotes vertical power structures within movements, contributing to a controversial management of Facebook pages and to internal divisions that significantly hinder the potential of protest.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== The Future ==\n\nSocial movements have existed before the Internet, but it is evident that the nature of social movements has been greatly modified through the Internet. The online world's beneficial impacts are clear, but these impacts are accompanied with detriments<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Tufekci|first=Zeynep|date=2014|title=SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND GOVERNMENTS IN THE DIGITAL AGE: EVALUATING A COMPLEX LANDSCAPE|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24461703|journal=Journal of International Affairs|volume=68|issue=1|pages=1\u201318|issn=0022-197X}}</ref>. Online movements are able to scale up dramatically and more quickly, but these horizontalist movements come at the expense of weathering risks and responses from the government<ref name=\":13\" />. \n\nIn comparing past social movements to social movements today, it is clear that many of them have heavily utilized online social media platforms to advance their agendas. With the help of many open source media platforms, such as Creative Commons and P2P Foundation, the public can easily gain access to the essence of these social movements. The prevalence of these platforms also allows for an easier way of marketing, while simultaneously reaching a wider range of audience. While many more social media tools are available today and as a result granted faster and easier preparation of a movement, it is up to debate whether this change has been good for the success of current movements. <ref name=\":12\" /> It is essential to continue to monitor this shift in culture in social movements and understand the advantages and drawbacks of having access to social media as a means to advance a movement. With the continued rapid evolution of the internet, the future of online movements is hard to predict. \n\n[[Vanessa DiMauro]], a community builder and researcher in decision-making, believes that the biggest trend concerning online communities is the formation of private online communities. While these large networks that we encounter and use on a daily basis have provided us with a productive and collaborative experience, they have also increased to unmanageable sizes. To become a learning environment, these groups need to be much smaller and manageable. This is where the idea and trend of private online communities could potentially be the future of online communities.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Misunderstanding-the-Internet-2nd-Edition/Curran-Fenton-Freedman/p/book/9781138906228|title=Misunderstanding the Internet: 2nd Edition (Paperback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional role of actors, such as social media organizations and governments, have also changed with online social movements.

With access to the internet and the fast-growing [[World Wide Web]], online social movements brought awareness to issues both political and social. Online social movements have been praised and criticized; the former for its ability to raise awareness to important causes, and the latter for its ability to perpetuate problems like [[slacktivism]]. Although online activism has received criticism, it has had real impacts on social movements.\n\n====== History of Online Social Movements ======\nThe earliest social movements were minimally related to the internet. For instance, Charles Tilly recognizes the first social movements in Britain and the US in the 1750s and 1760s, after the 7 Years War. [[John Wilkes]] led the \"Wilkes and Liberty\" movement to achieve legal and parliamentary reform. Across the Atlantic, the Boston merchants and the activists in the [[Sons of Liberty]] initiated the opposition to the British that eventually lead to the Declaration of Independence in 1776.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Tilly, Charles 1929-2008 Verfasser.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1126812829|title=Social movements, 1768-2018|isbn=978-0-367-07607-8|oclc=1126812829}}</ref>\n\nThe mentality behind these was spurred on by sovereignty within British politics through the Reformation and informed John Wilkes and his followers about alternative societal rule. Thus, in 1768, members of the English lower class began to mobilize underneath Wilkes\u2019 movement against the sovereignty of the ruling class.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Cash, Arthur.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/952732211|title=John Wilkes : the Scandalous Father of Civil Liberty.|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-10871-0|oclc=952732211}}</ref> On May 10, 1768, Wilkes\u2019 supporters and the king\u2019s soldiers at St. George\u2019s field began fighting, resulting in about six to eleven protesters dead.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Rudbeck|first=Jens|date=2012-10-05|title=Popular sovereignty and the historical origin of the social movement|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11186-012-9180-x|journal=Theory and Society|volume=41|issue=6|pages=581\u2013601|doi=10.1007/s11186-012-9180-x|issn=0304-2421}}</ref> This event sparked speculation about where sovereignty lies. The rise of the Wilkes movement marked the beginning of a new phase in British politics where the notion of popular sovereignty became dominant.<ref name=\":7\" /> Wilkes and his followers consistently challenged the leading authority through actions taken outside of parliament and on the basis of contesting laws. They created something that was so new that it laid the groundwork for political struggles to come: social movements.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThese situations, while different in nature from social movements we experience today, started the idea of mass-gathering to contest an issue. Modern examples of social movements include the Movement of the Unemployed in the 1930s, the Free Speech and Civil Rights Movements in the 1960s, the lower-profile 1990s movements and the many movements in the 21st century.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nSocial movements have evolved to a more dynamic, organized, effective, and prominent state than ever before, in part due to social movements presence on social media. The earliest online social movements began right after the Internet revolution. While the Arab Springs are commonly associated with the earliest online movements, in reality, social movements began through email. In 1990, software company [[Lotus 1-2-3|Lotus]] and credit bureau [[Equifax]] gained access to names, addresses and purchasing behavior of 120 million Americans in CD-ROM format. In response, nearly 30,000 consumers organised through emails and message boards in protest, halting the release of the database by 1991.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gurak, Laura J.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/40927039|title=Persuasion and privacy in cyberspace : the online protests over Lotus Marketplace and the Clipper Chip.|date=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-07864-1|oclc=40927039}}</ref>\n\nSince the late 2000s, there has been an increasing use of commercial social media platforms by social movements. According to Lopes, \"Social Media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and the various online blogs have arguably given a voice to individuals that otherwise would not be heard.\" <ref name=\":10\" />\n\nMany people have conflicting views on social media and its effectiveness when put to the task of activism. Interestingly, Pew Research Centre found that some 64% of Americans feel that the statement \u2018social media help give a voice to underrepresented groups\u2019 describes these sites very or somewhat well. But a larger share say social networking sites distract people from issues that are truly important (77% feel this way), and 71% agree with the assertion that \u2018social media makes people believe they\u2019re making a difference even when they really are not really making change.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/07/11/activism-in-the-social-media-age/|title=Activism in the Social Media Age|last=NW|first=1615 L.

movements has been substantial since the introduction of the internet. With the ever-growing medium of social media, internet activism has reached the forefront of the internet. Through the use of social networking sites such as [[Facebook]] and content-sharing sites as [[YouTube]], the opportunity for wide-scale, online social participation has increased.<ref>Rotman, D., Preece, J., Vieweg, S., Shneiderman, B., Yardi, S., Pirolli, P., Chi, E.H., Glaisyer, T. (2011). From Slacktivism to Activism: Participatory Culture in the Age of Social Media</ref>\n\n=== Benefits ===\n\nOnline social movements have been celebrated for their ability to amass large amounts of success. The online world provides the power to organise without any formal organisations, which speeds up the process of mobilisation and allows for greater scale in rapid time frames.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shirky, Clay.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/883359654|title=Here comes everybody : the power of organizing without organizations|date=2014|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-1-4406-3224-2|oclc=883359654}}</ref> This can be understood as New Power, which supports informal leadership and radical transparency, conducive for large amounts of participation by people on social media.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Heimans|first=Jeremy|url=https://hbr.org/2014/12/understanding-new-power|title=Understanding \"New Power\"|date=2014-12-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2020-04-14|last2=Timms|first2=Henry|issue=December 2014|issn=0017-8012}}</ref> Previously, the dominant form of old power limited participation in movements and leadership to a small group.<ref name=\":0\" /> Rapid mobilisation helps people overcome pluralistic ignorance, where individuals believe that they are the only person with a particular view. Instead, the online networked sphere helps reveal otherwise preferences to each other in order to discover common ground.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|last=TUFEKCI, ZEYNEP.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1002689516|title=TWITTER AND TEAR GAS : the power and fragility of networked protest.|date=2018|publisher=YALE University Press|isbn=0-300-23417-1|oclc=1002689516}}</ref>\u00a0 The increased visibility of a movement on the internet supports a sense of camaraderie, setting and maintaining a cause, even if it is otherwise decentralised. Social media can overcome pluralistic ignorance,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Mina, An Xiao, 1983-|title=Memes to movements : how the world's most viral media is changing social protest and power|date=8 January 2019|isbn=978-0-8070-5658-5|location=Boston|oclc=1039236703}}</ref> which is the belief that your opinions are not shared by others, when in reality, they tend to be. The online world enables the synchronisation of opinions across disparate geographies, creating new norms of behavior and belief through regular repetition and affirmation of messages.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the political sphere, active online groups increase political participation by providing a framework for discussion, leading petitions, and collecting donations in order to further a political agenda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/brief/how-social-movements-are-using-internet-change-politics|title=How Social Movements are Using the Internet to Change Politics {{!}} Scholars Strategy Network|website=www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref> This alignment of values has often results in the potential to organise, such as fund raising in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge that raised $100 million in just 30 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alsa.org/news/media/press-releases/ice-bucket-challenge-082914.html|title=The ALS Association Expresses Sincere Gratitude to Over Three Million Donors|website=ALSA.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}</ref>\nOnline movements are able to sustain attention across boundaries, physical and temporal. For instance, during the Egyptian Revolution in 2011, Facebook\u2019s event function allowed for people to organise protests, which would then be acted out upon in real-life. Similarly, the Occupy movement was able to gather an online following around the world through the Tumblr blog, titled \u201cWe are the 99%\u201d. The function of being able to post on a shared website supported the gathering of different narratives, unifying people. In fact, online social movements epitomises the notion of \u201cmany yeses, one no\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> This motto highlights how the online world brings together diverse voices against something they all feel strongly about, by acting as integrating screens since people use these devices to connect with others, rather than to isolate themselves. In many ways, social media has created networks conducive for unification across different identities, supporting intersectional approaches to fighting injustice. For instance, the [[Zapatistas]] attempted to emphasise their inclusivity of the movement, which had begun as somewhat of a peasants revolt. The leader of the movement, Marcos, was famously presented in numerous identities, of different exploited and marginalised minorities who are saying \u201cEnough\u201d to their situation:<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Marcos|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/professionals-of-hope-the-selected-writings-of-subcomandante-marcos/oclc/1004260843|title=Professionals of hope: the selected writings of Subcomandante Marcos|last2=Jauregui|first2=Gabriela|date=2017|isbn=978-0-9967786-5-7|oclc=1004260843}}</ref><blockquote>\u201cYes, Marcos is gay. Marcos is gay in San Francisco, black in South Africa, an Asian in Europe, a Chicano in San Ysidro, an anarchist in Spain, a Palestinian in Israel, a Mayan Indian in the streets of San Cristobal, a Jew in Germany, a Gypsy in Poland, a Mohawk in Quebec, a pacifist in Bosnia, a single woman on the subway at 10pm, a peasant without land, a gang member in the slums, an unemployed worker, an unhappy student and, of course, a Zapatista in the mountains. Marcos is all the exploited, marginalised, oppressed minorities resisting and saying 'Enough.' He is every minority who is now beginning to speak, and every majority that must shut up and listen. He is every untolerated group searching for a way to speak. Everything that makes power and the good consciences of those in power uncomfortable\u2014this is Marcos.\u201d -Subcommandant Marcos, from Social Justice E-Zine #27 <ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>Social media is also able to provide a creative milieu that is conducive for narrative building. Memes, in particular, have proven to be a useful tool when it comes to repeat certain ideas so that they enter the public consciousness and are able to retain attention. Often, the large numbers of people online allow for intentional overproduction.<ref name=\":2\" /> Amanda D. Lotz noted that this is a key strategy, where multiple shows and commercials are created in order to compete, so that the most effective version can succeed, while the others disappear.<ref name=\":2\" /> In online social movements, hashtag culture functions by having many people copy each other and come up with new permutations, allowing for the most successful version to spread.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSocial media platforms are harder to censor than real-life organisation of movements. Ethan Zuckerman advanced the [[Cute cat theory of digital activism|Cute Cat Theory of Digital Activism]], which explains the relative lack of censorship online. Zuckerman posits that the web is used primarily for innocuous purposes, such as connecting with families and friends and posting pictures of cats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/12/03/cute-cat-theory-the-china-corollary/|title=Cute Cat Theory: The China Corollary {{!}} \u2026 My heart\u2019s in Accra|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, the affordances that social media provides activists nurtures a community that engages in political criticism. Still, these activists are able to hide behind the largely mundane uses of the internet, since censorship by governments would appear especially draconian. For instance, the Twitter ban in Turkey by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan who intended to \u201cwipe out\u201d the social media platform was met with furious outrage from the population, experts and the global community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-election-idUSBREA2K0NK20140321|title=Furious reaction, political split after Turkey bans Twitter|date=2014-03-21|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en}}</ref> Similarly when ex-Tunisian President Ben Ali attempted to ban Facebook in 2010, his move backfired because so many Tunisians used Facebook to connect with family, friends and acquaintances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/01/12/the-limits-of-silencing-tunisia/|title=The limits of silencing Tunisia|last=Bounenni|first=Bassam|website=Foreign Policy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Detriments ===\n\nNevertheless, there are numerous critiques posed against online social movements.\n\nMost frequently, the limited capacity for tangible change is often raised. For social movements to be successful, there need to be network internalities, which are durable networks ideal for organised action.<ref name=\":2\" /> These networks are the result of long-term challenges that are collectively overcome, which supports trust building. This process requires the investment of time and energy in order for members of a social movement to learn how to cooperate to achieve their goals.\n\nZeynep Tufekci introduces the Mount Everest metaphor in her comparison of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]\u2019s achievements with the [[Arab Spring]]\u2019s relative limited scope of change, especially in Egypt.<ref name=\":2\" /> Zeynep draws a comparison between social media and Sherpas. Previously, climbing Mount Everest was a challenging task. However, with Sherpas, more people were capable of doing so, and this led to a spike in mountaineering tourism. Nevertheless, these individuals remained unprepared for the reality of scaling the mountain, resulting in a spike in deaths. Similarly, social media has enabled more social movements to spread and enter the public sphere. However, there has not been long-term training and building of network internalities which is necessary to sustain these movements.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Civil Rights Movement had undergone strenuous planning and organisation, which has resulted in leaders who were able to represent the cause, such as Martin Luther King. In contrast, online social movements tend to be more short-lived. For instance, [[Kony 2012]] brought attention to child soldiers being forced into Joseph Kony\u2019s [[Lord\u2019s Resistance Army]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/problem-stop-kony/330661/|title=The Problems with 'Stop Kony'|last=Abad-Santos|first=Alexander|date=2012-03-08|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, the small organisation that directed the video, Invisible Children, was incapable of managing the sheer volume of attention received. Without the network internalities present in the Civil Rights Movement, the director [[Jason Russell]] had a major breakdown and the social movement dissipated.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Curtis|first=Polly|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/kony-2012-nirvana-missed-chance|title=Kony 2012: nirvana of online campaigning or missed chance?|date=2012-04-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThere is also the concern of a lack of clear leadership in online social movements. This means that there might be a challenge in finding representatives to negotiate within the movement and with adversaries. These individuals might have little in common beyond the initial movement. For instance, [[Tahrir Square]] protesters could not deviate tactically from their initial demand, which was to overthrow the Hosni Mubarak regime. Hence, there was a tactical freeze, where tactics could not be adjusted and new demands were not articulated by the social movement. Even the creator of \u201cWe are All Khaled Said\u201d, the main Facebook page of the Egyptian Revolution, Wael Ghonim was in no position to concede anything. Ghonim was neither an elected leader, nor an informal one, which denied him legitimacy to engage in negotiations.<ref name=\":2\" /> Similarly, in the [[Occupy movement]], there was an attempt to empower all protestors to be leaders of the movement. However, as a \u201cleaderful\u201d movement, there was a lack of ability to identify a clear representative to negotiate since there were too many perspectives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Costanza-Chock|first=Sasha|date=2012-08-01|title=Mic Check! Media Cultures and the Occupy Movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2012.710746|journal=Social Movement Studies|volume=11|issue=3-4|pages=375\u2013385|doi=10.1080/14742837.2012.710746|issn=1474-2837}}</ref>\n\nOnline social movements, while effective in unifying people, might also amplify the tendency to tribalism. In particular, more people having access to social media might democratise the risk of promoting violence, especially where institutions are not stable and there can be large amounts of distrust and disinformation. For instance, while social media had helped Sri Lanka ease the path to its first democratic elections in 2015 after years of civil war, communal hatreds began to overrun the news feeds, which are the primary portal of news and information for many users.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Taub|first=Amanda|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/world/asia/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html|title=Where Countries Are Tinderboxes and Facebook Is a Match|date=2018-04-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-14|last2=Fisher|first2=Max|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nSome critiques, specific to online social media activism, have been raised about the power mechanisms and organisational tructure.  This transition highlighted asymmetrical relationships between the for-profit aims of social media and the copy-left values that drive many online movements. According to Fenton, \"Claims for the extension and re-invention of activism need to be considered in the context of the material social and political world of inequality, injustice and corporate dominance.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> For example, \"in his analysis of the [[Purple People|Purple Movemen]]<nowiki/>t (Popolo Viola) in Italy and its extensive use of Facebook, Coretti (2014)<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite thesis|title=The Purple Movement: Social Media and Activism in Berlusconi\u2019s Italy|url=https://westminsterresearch.westminster.ac.uk/item/964wx/the-purple-movement-social-media-and-activism-in-berlusconi-s-italy|publisher=University of Westminster|date=2014|degree=doctoral|language=en|first=L.|last=Coretti}}</ref> demonstrates that, while the myth of the network as open and inclusive persists, it acts as a disguise for the communication protocols of commercial social networking platforms that may well enable large-scale mobilization but ultimately, through their very functionality, encourage organizational centralization and fragmentation in social movements\" <ref name=\":9\" />. The proprietary nature of the design of platforms, such as Facebook pages, possibly fails to provide movements with the necessary instruments in a shared democratic management of their resources. Moreover, the inability to manage Facebook pages and groups according to commonly agreed values promotes vertical power structures within movements, contributing to a controversial management of Facebook pages and to internal divisions that significantly hinder the potential of protest.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== The Future ==\n\nSocial movements have existed before the Internet, but it is evident that the nature of social movements has been greatly modified through the Internet. The online world's beneficial impacts are clear, but these impacts are accompanied with detriments<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Tufekci|first=Zeynep|date=2014|title=SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND GOVERNMENTS IN THE DIGITAL AGE: EVALUATING A COMPLEX LANDSCAPE|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24461703|journal=Journal of International Affairs|volume=68|issue=1|pages=1\u201318|issn=0022-197X}}</ref>. Online movements are able to scale up dramatically and more quickly, but these horizontalist movements come at the expense of weathering risks and responses from the government<ref name=\":13\" />. \n\nIn comparing past social movements to social movements today, it is clear that many of them have heavily utilized online social media platforms to advance their agendas. With the help of many open source media platforms, such as Creative Commons and P2P Foundation, the public can easily gain access to the essence of these social movements. The prevalence of these platforms also allows for an easier way of marketing, while simultaneously reaching a wider range of audience. While many more social media tools are available today and as a result granted faster and easier preparation of a movement, it is up to debate whether this change has been good for the success of current movements. <ref name=\":12\" /> It is essential to continue to monitor this shift in culture in social movements and understand the advantages and drawbacks of having access to social media as a means to advance a movement.\n\nWith the continued rapid evolution of the internet, the future of online movements is hard to predict. [[Vanessa DiMauro]], a community builder and researcher in decision-making, believes that the biggest trend concerning online communities is the formation of private online communities. While these large networks that we encounter and use on a daily basis have provided us with a productive and collaborative experience, they have also increased to unmanageable sizes. To become a learning environment, these groups need to be much smaller and manageable. This is where the idea and trend of private online communities could potentially be the future of online communities.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Misunderstanding-the-Internet-2nd-Edition/Curran-Fenton-Freedman/p/book/9781138906228|title=Misunderstanding the Internet: 2nd Edition (Paperback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref> \n\nThe traditional role of actors, such as social media organizations and governments, have also changed with online social movements. In these online communities, social movement organizations have been less necessary for online participation<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Earl|first=Jennifer|date=2014-12-09|title=The Future of Social Movement Organizations: The Waning Dominance of SMOs Online|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273590336_The_Future_of_Social_Movement_Organizations_The_Waning_Dominance_of_SMOs_Online|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=59|pages=35\u201352|doi=10.1177/0002764214540507}}</ref>. While these organisations have continued to play a role in offline engagements, social media organizations have begun to find new avenues for their contribution to social change<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Earl|first=Jennifer|date=2014-12-09|title=The Future of Social Movement Organizations: The Waning Dominance of SMOs Online|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273590336_The_Future_of_Social_Movement_Organizations_The_Waning_Dominance_of_SMOs_Online|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=59|pages=35\u201352|doi=10.1177/0002764214540507}}</ref>.  Similarly, governments have found new ways to respond to online social movements. They have done this by developing new methods to response to social media threats, as well as by developing new methods of repression<ref name=\":13\" />.

He was one of the all-time great [[Rugby league positions#Scrum-half|halfbacks]] and a major contributor to [[Parramatta Eels]]' dominance of the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]] in the 1980s. Sterling played eighteen Tests for the [[Australian Kangaroos|Australian national team]] between 1982 and 1988. He also played in thirteen [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origins]] for [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]], winning man of the match on four occasions. He played in four premiership-winning sides with Parramatta in 1981\u20131983 and 1986 and has been inducted into the [[Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame]]. His time spent playing for English club [[Hull F.C.]] also earned him membership in their hall of fame.\n\n==Early life==\nSterling was born in Toowoomba and raised in Raymond Terrace and [[Wagga Wagga]], [[New South Wales, Australia]].\n\nHe commenced his playing career at the age of fourteen when he joined the Wagga Wagga Kangaroo Panthers in 1974.<ref>now called Wagga Wagga Kangaroos [https://web.archive.org/web/20070324083635/http://www.wagga.nsw.gov.au/museum/index.aspx?item=shof&sub=browse&cat=museum_shof&article=AP49C3XJWQ7LF13JBAZ4 WAGGA KANGAROOS JUNIOR RUGBY LEAGUE INC.]</ref> As a teenager he spent several years living at [[RAAF Base Wagga]], where his father was serving as a dental technician. Sterling then moved to Sydney, where he attended the [[Patrician Brothers' College, Fairfield|Patrician Brothers' College]] on a scholarship.\n\n==Playing career==\nSterling compensated for a lack of size and pace with control and organisational skills that allowed Parramatta's all-star back line of [[Brett Kenny]], [[Mick Cronin (rugby league)|Mick Cronin]], [[Steve Ella]] and [[Eric Grothe, Sr.|Eric Grothe]] a great deal of ball. His kicking, backed up by Kenny and [[Ray Price (rugby)|Ray Price]]'s superb chasing, often gave Parramatta an advantage in territory. His fast mind meant that he rarely made a wrong decision.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. He was an effective defender rare to miss a tackle, and often in position to secure a loose ball.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nHe joined the [[Parramatta Eels]] in 1978 making his first appearance as a {{rlp|FB}} during the [[1978 NSWRFL season#Finals|1978 finals series]], and played his first game as the Eels halfback in the 17\u201311 Minor-Semi [[Replay (sports)|replay]] loss to eventual premiers [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]]. After a few games at {{rlp|FE}} in [[1979 NSWRFL season|1979]], Sterling shifted to halfback and established himself as a player to watch in [[1980 NSWRFL season|1980]]. 1981 saw the [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]] coached Eels win their first [[1981 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|Grand Final]] with a 20\u201311 win over the [[Tommy Raudonikis]] led [[Newtown Jets]], with Sterling's superb skill and control one of the decisive factors. He made his State of Origin d\u00e9but for NSW in the [[1981 State of Origin game]], setting up a try for Mick Cronin, though the [[Wally Lewis]] led [[Queensland Maroons|Queenslanders]] turned a 10-point half time deficit into a 7-point, 22\u201315 win. Sterling himself admitted he was a surprise choice for NSW as he had only made his representative d\u00e9but a few weeks earlier when he played for City Seconds and rated himself as fifth in line for the NSW job. He was selected over his long-time rival for the NSW halfback spot, [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]]'s [[Steve Mortimer]] who had debuted for [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] in their two test series win over [[France national rugby league team|France]] only weeks before the Origin game.\n\nIn [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982]], Parramatta could seemingly do no wrong, winning the Minor Premiership by four games over Manly. Though they were beaten 20\u20130 by Manly in the Major semi-final, the Eels then thrashed [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] 33\u20130 in the Preliminary Final, before going on to turn the tables on the Sea Eagles with a 21\u20138 in the Grand Final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] to win their second successive premiership.\n\nSterling was then chosen for the [[1982 Kangaroo tour]], and along with Queensland halfback [[Mark Murray (rugby league)|Mark Murray]] was backup to incumbent test halfback Steve Mortimer, despite having not played in the [[1982 State of Origin series]]. After travelling with part of the team to [[Perth]] to face a [[Western Australian Rugby League|Western Australian]] team and thus missing a place in Australia's first ever test against [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]], Sterling was presented a golden opportunity by coach [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]] when he was chosen for the first game of the tour against [[Rugby Football League|English]] club side [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. Sterling went about cementing his place in the Kangaroos \"A\" side and went on to make his Test d\u00e9but for Australia in the first [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes Test]] against [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] at [[Boothferry Park]] in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. The 1982 Kangaroos went on to become the first team to go through Great Britain and France undefeated, earning them the nickname '''''\"[[The Invincibles (rugby league)|The Invincibles]]\"''''', and was a personal success for Sterling who played in all five tests against Great Britain and [[France national rugby league team|France]], and cemented his place as the world's best halfback.\n\nIn 1983, Sterling played in Australia's win in the first test against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] at [[Carlaw Park]] in [[Auckland]], but wasn't selected for Australia's shock 12\u201319 second Test loss at [[Lang Park]] when Murray was preferred. He was named man-of-the-match in Game 2 of the [[1983 State of Origin series|State of Origin series]] at the SCG, a game which saw the NSW side with an almost all-Parramatta backline, with [[Neil Hunt]] and Eric Grothe (wings), Mick Cronin and Steve Ella (centres) and Sterling and Brett Kenny (halves), while the Blues, who defeated Qld 10\u20136, were also captained by Eels {{rlp|LK}} forward Ray Price. Sterling then helped Parramatta to a third successive [[1983 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|Grand Final win]] with an 18\u20136 win, again over runaway minor premiers Manly. Following his third successive premiership and his fifth overall, Jack Gibson, a man Peter Sterling has nothing but high praise for as both a person and a coach, shocked the establishment and resigned as Parramatta coach.\n\nFollowing the 1982 [[Kangaroo Tour]], Sterling had been highly sought after by English clubs and he went on to play for [[Hull F.C.]] in the [[1983\u201384 Rugby Football League season|1983\u201384 English season]]. Sterling played {{rlp|sh}}, and was [[man of the match]] winning the [[White Rose Trophy]] in [[Hull F.C.|Hull FC]]'s 29\u201312 victory over [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] in the [[1984 Yorkshire Cup|1984]] [[RFL Yorkshire Cup|Yorkshire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]] Final during the [[1984\u201385 Rugby Football League season|1984\u201385 season]] at [[Boothferry Park]], [[Kingston upon Hull]], on Saturday 27 October 1984. He was then chosen for Game 1 of the [[1984 State of Origin series]], but lost his place to Steve Mortimer for the rest of the series. Sterling was then overlooked for the home Ashes series against Great Britain in 1984, but would still go on to win the ''[[Rugby League Week]]'' Player of the Year award for the first time. In the [[1984 NSWRL season#Grand Final|1984 Grand Final]], Sterling and longtime partner in crime Brett Kenny had few opportunities against Mortimers Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs whose forwards dominated the Eels pack and gave the star pairing little room to move. The narrow 6\u20134 loss to the Bulldogs ended the now [[John Monie]] coached Parramatta's bid for a 4th successive premiership.\n\nSterling did not play for Parramatta, in the first half of [[1985 NSWRL season|1985]] as he returned to England to again link with Hull. Peter Sterling played {{rlp|sh}} in [[Hull F.C.|Hull FC]]'s 0\u201312 defeat by [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] in the [[1984\u201385 League Cup (rugby league)|1984\u201385]] [[League Cup (rugby league)|John Player Special Trophy]] Final during the [[1984\u201385 Rugby Football League season|1984\u201385 season]] at [[Boothferry Park]], [[Kingston upon Hull]] on Saturday 26 January 1985. Though he was relatively quiet upon his return to Parramatta, at the end of the season Sterling's skill allowed Parramatta to defeat [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] (twice, the second a 32\u20134 win in the Minor-Semi) and [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] (Minor Preliminary-Semi), to move from doubtful finalists to the Preliminary Final \u2013 where a ruthless Canterbury side on their way to a second successive premiership, easily accounted for the Eels 26\u20130. As a result of his decision to play in England and miss the first part of the NSWRL premiership, Sterling lost his place in the NSW side in the [[1985 State of Origin series]] to Steve Mortimer, who led the Blues to their first ever series win over Queensland. He also miss his chance to regain his test place for the mid-season tour of New Zealand in 1985, with the halfback role shared between Mark Murray and Manly's versatile utility [[Des Hasler]]. By missing both Origin and Test selection in 1985, Sterling missed the opportunity to link with the coach who gave him his first grade d\u00e9but at Parramatta [[Terry Fearnley]], who coached both representative teams.\n\nWhile playing for Hull in the early part of 1985, Sterling led the team into the [[Challenge Cup|1985 Challenge Cup Final]] against [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], which also included a number of internationals such as; fullback [[Gary Kemble]], wingers [[Dane O'Hara]] and [[James Leuluai]] and his halves partner [[Fred Ah Kuoi]] (all NZ), centre [[Garry Schofield]] (GB), Parramatta second-rower [[John Muggleton]] (Aus), and goal kicking forward (and Hull captain) [[Lee Crooks (rugby league)|Lee Crooks]] (GB), Sterling played {{rlp|sh}} in [[Hull F.C.|Hull FC]]'s 24\u201328 defeat by [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] in the [[1985 Challenge Cup|1985]] [[Challenge Cup]] Final during the [[1984\u201385 Rugby Football League season#Challenge Cup|1984\u201385 season]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], [[London]] on Saturday 4 May 1985, in front of a crowd of 99,801,<ref name=\"1984-1985 Challenge Cup Final\">{{cite web|url=http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=445|title=1984\u20131985 Challenge Cup Final|publisher=wigan.rlfans.com|date=31 December 2011|accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref> in what is regarded as the most marvellous cup final in living memory,<ref name=\"100 years of rugby league: From the great divide to the Super era\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/100-years-of-rugby-league-from-the-great-divide-to-the-super-era-1597130.html|title=100 years of rugby league: From the great divide to the Super era|newspaper=independent.co.uk|date=20 August 1995|accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref> which Hull narrowly lost after fighting back from 12\u201328 down at half-time, with Sterling's Parramatta halves partner Brett Kenny (playing for Wigan) was voted [[man of the match]] winning the [[Lance Todd Trophy]]. Sterling, who produced a great game in both attack and defense, had gone into the game as one of the shortest priced favourites to win the Lance Todd Trophy, with bookmakers in Hull allegedly (according to [[BBC]] commentator [[Ray French]] during the telecast of the Cup Final) refusing to field any more bets on Sterling in the week leading up to the game.\n\n1986 saw Sterling almost carry a clean sweep of the major awards \u2013 except the [[Rothmans Medal]] \u2013 and win the inaugural [[Clive Churchill Medal]] in Parramatta's fourth [[1986 NSWRL season#Grand Final|Grand Final victory]], reversing the 1984 result with a 4\u20132 win over Canterbury-Bankstown to send the retiring Mick Cronin and team captain Ray Price out as premiership winners. 1986 also saw the Parramatta with their own home ground for the first time since over-excited fans had burned down the old [[Cumberland Oval]] grandstand during the 1981 Grand Final celebrations. Between 1982 and 1985 the club was forced to play home games at Canterbury-Bankstown's home ground, the [[Belmore Sports Ground]], but in 1986 the new [[Parramatta Stadium]] was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and Sterling set about making the venue his own personal playground.\n\nDuring the year he was also part of the NSW Team which swept Qld 3\u20130 in the [[1986 State of Origin series|State of Origin series]] (the first time in series history a team had won all three games), winning man of the match in Game 2 at the SCG. After regaining his test place in the successful two test series against New Zealand, Sterling was an automatic selection for his second [[1986 Kangaroo tour|Kangaroo tour]] at the end of the season, this time going away as the undisputed number one halfback with 1985 test halfback Des Hasler.\n\nSterling won The Rothman's medal in 1987 and 1990 but only featured in one match of The 1991 season after suffering a shoulder injury.  Sterling returned to the field in 1992, but his shoulder was injured again after being hit in a hard tackle by Western Suburbs player David Gillespie.  This would prove to be Sterling's final game as he retired due to being unable to recover from the recurring shoulder problem.<ref>https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/parramatta/end-of-an-era-as-eels-bid-farewell-to-parramatta-stadium/news-story/d02542b281c516e5c6b09066666390c6</ref>\n\n==Post-playing career==\nSterling lives on the Central Coast with his wife, Selina, and 18-year-old daughter, Hannah and 21-year-old son James. The playing of golf is to his thorough enjoyment and he revels in the breeding of thoroughbreds. Sterling supports [[Liverpool F.C.]] in the [[Premier League]].\n\n===Television / Radio career===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2017}}\nSterling's sharp intelligence marked him as an astute analyst of the game with the former Eel commentating for the [[Nine Network]] after initially starting in the media with Western Sydney radio station [[101.7 WSFM|2WS]] and [[TEN (TV station)|Channel 10]] where he was a sideline commentator for their coverage of the 1987 NSWRL finals.\n\nHis autobiography, 'Sterlo! The Story of a Champion' was released in 1989.\n\nHe later went on to host ''[[The Sunday Footy Show (rugby league)|The Sunday Footy Show]]'', anchoring the program from the show's inception in 1993 until the end of the 2015 season with Sterling replaced by Yvonne Sampson from the 2016 season.\n\nSterling was also co-host of Nine's ''[[The NRL Footy Show]]'' from 1994\u20132006 alongside [[Paul Vautin]]. He made a guest appearance in 2007 on the first episode for the year to say farewell to the show before coming back for a short stint in 2010 as alternating host.\n\nHe currently hosts Nine's 'Thursday Night Football' and is a member of their commentary team, he also rotates the hosting of 'Sunday Afternoon Football' with Yvonne Sampson.\n\nSterling joined [[Triple M]] in March 2010 as an expert commentator on ''[[Monday Night Football on Triple M|Monday Night Football]]'' and is an occasional panellist on Dead Set Legends and The Rush Hour.\n\nIn March 2013, Sterling began hosting a weekly NRL show on [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] called 'Sterlo; airing on Thursday nights. His show was axed in 2014 due to poor ratings competing with The Footy Show.\n\nHe now hosts ''On the Couch with Sterlo'' which airs on Tuesday every week.\n\n===Rugby League awards===\nSince retiring from playing the game, Sterling has won several awards.\nIn 1995, Sterling was picked at halfback in a poll to judge the best Australian team since the introduction of the limited-tackle rule in 1967. He won eight of fourteen votes, with the remainder going to [[Billy Smith (rugby league)|Billy Smith]], [[Ricky Stuart]] and [[Allan Langer]].\n\nIn 2000 Sterling was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]] for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. He was also inducted into the [[Sport Australia Hall of Fame]] in that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahof.org.au/hall-of-fame/member-profile/?memberID=212&memberType=athlete|title=Peter Sterling OAM|publisher=Sport Australia Hall of Fame|accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> In 2006, he was one of six past players to be inducted into the [[Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame]] at the [[2006 Dally M Awards|Dally M.

He was one of the all-time great [[Rugby league positions#Scrum-half|halfbacks]] and a major contributor to [[Parramatta Eels]]' dominance of the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]] in the 1980s. Sterling played eighteen Tests for the [[Australian Kangaroos|Australian national team]] between 1982 and 1988. He also played in thirteen [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origins]] for [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]], winning man of the match on four occasions. He played in four premiership-winning sides with Parramatta in 1981\u20131983 and 1986 and has been inducted into the [[Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame]]. His time spent playing for English club [[Hull F.C.]] also earned him membership in their hall of fame.\n\n==Early life==\nSterling was born in Toowoomba and raised in Raymond Terrace and [[Wagga Wagga]], [[New South Wales, Australia]].\n\nHe commenced his playing career at the age of fourteen when he joined the Wagga Wagga Kangaroo Panthers in 1974.<ref>now called Wagga Wagga Kangaroos [https://web.archive.org/web/20070324083635/http://www.wagga.nsw.gov.au/museum/index.aspx?item=shof&sub=browse&cat=museum_shof&article=AP49C3XJWQ7LF13JBAZ4 WAGGA KANGAROOS JUNIOR RUGBY LEAGUE INC.]</ref> As a teenager he spent several years living at [[RAAF Base Wagga]], where his father was serving as a dental technician. Sterling then moved to Sydney where he attended the [[Patrician Brothers' College, Fairfield|Patrician Brothers' College]] on a scholarship.\n\n==Playing career==\nSterling compensated for a lack of size and pace with control and organisational skills that allowed Parramatta's all-star back line of [[Brett Kenny]], [[Mick Cronin (rugby league)|Mick Cronin]], [[Steve Ella]] and [[Eric Grothe, Sr.|Eric Grothe]] a great deal of ball. His kicking, backed up by Kenny and [[Ray Price (rugby)|Ray Price]]'s superb chasing, often gave Parramatta an advantage in territory. His fast mind meant that he rarely made a wrong decision.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. He was an effective defender rare to miss a tackle, and often in position to secure a loose ball.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nHe joined the [[Parramatta Eels]] in 1978 making his first appearance as a {{rlp|FB}} during the [[1978 NSWRFL season#Finals|1978 finals series]], and played his first game as the Eels halfback in the 17\u201311 Minor-Semi [[Replay (sports)|replay]] loss to eventual premiers [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]]. After a few games at {{rlp|FE}} in [[1979 NSWRFL season|1979]], Sterling shifted to halfback and established himself as a player to watch in [[1980 NSWRFL season|1980]]. 1981 saw the [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]] coached Eels win their first [[1981 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|Grand Final]] with a 20\u201311 win over the [[Tommy Raudonikis]] led [[Newtown Jets]], with Sterling's superb skill and control one of the decisive factors. He made his State of Origin d\u00e9but for NSW in the [[1981 State of Origin game]], setting up a try for Mick Cronin, though the [[Wally Lewis]] led [[Queensland Maroons|Queenslanders]] turned a 10-point half time deficit into a 7-point, 22\u201315 win. Sterling himself admitted he was a surprise choice for NSW as he had only made his representative d\u00e9but a few weeks earlier when he played for City Seconds and rated himself as fifth in line for the NSW job. He was selected over his long-time rival for the NSW halfback spot, [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]]'s [[Steve Mortimer]] who had debuted for [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] in their two test series win over [[France national rugby league team|France]] only weeks before the Origin game.\n\nIn [[1982 NSWRFL season|1982]], Parramatta could seemingly do no wrong, winning the Minor Premiership by four games over Manly. Though they were beaten 20\u20130 by Manly in the Major semi-final, the Eels then thrashed [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] 33\u20130 in the Preliminary Final, before going on to turn the tables on the Sea Eagles with a 21\u20138 in the Grand Final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] to win their second successive premiership.\n\nSterling was then chosen for the [[1982 Kangaroo tour]], and along with Queensland halfback [[Mark Murray (rugby league)|Mark Murray]] was backup to incumbent test halfback Steve Mortimer, despite having not played in the [[1982 State of Origin series]]. After travelling with part of the team to [[Perth]] to face a [[Western Australian Rugby League|Western Australian]] team and thus missing a place in Australia's first ever test against [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]], Sterling was presented a golden opportunity by coach [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]] when he was chosen for the first game of the tour against [[Rugby Football League|English]] club side [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. Sterling went about cementing his place in the Kangaroos \"A\" side and went on to make his Test d\u00e9but for Australia in the first [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes Test]] against [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] at [[Boothferry Park]] in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. The 1982 Kangaroos went on to become the first team to go through Great Britain and France undefeated, earning them the nickname '''''\"[[The Invincibles (rugby league)|The Invincibles]]\"''''', and was a personal success for Sterling who played in all five tests against Great Britain and [[France national rugby league team|France]], and cemented his place as the world's best halfback.\n\nIn 1983, Sterling played in Australia's win in the first test against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] at [[Carlaw Park]] in [[Auckland]], but wasn't selected for Australia's shock 12\u201319 second Test loss at [[Lang Park]] when Murray was preferred. He was named man-of-the-match in Game 2 of the [[1983 State of Origin series|State of Origin series]] at the SCG, a game which saw the NSW side with an almost all-Parramatta backline, with [[Neil Hunt]] and Eric Grothe (wings), Mick Cronin and Steve Ella (centres) and Sterling and Brett Kenny (halves), while the Blues, who defeated Qld 10\u20136, were also captained by Eels {{rlp|LK}} forward Ray Price. Sterling then helped Parramatta to a third successive [[1983 NSWRFL season#Grand Final|Grand Final win]] with an 18\u20136 win, again over runaway minor premiers Manly. Following his third successive premiership and his fifth overall, Jack Gibson, a man Peter Sterling has nothing but high praise for as both a person and a coach, shocked the establishment and resigned as Parramatta coach.\n\nFollowing the 1982 [[Kangaroo Tour]], Sterling had been highly sought after by English clubs and he went on to play for [[Hull F.C.]] in the [[1983\u201384 Rugby Football League season|1983\u201384 English season]]. Sterling played {{rlp|sh}}, and was [[man of the match]] winning the [[White Rose Trophy]] in [[Hull F.C.|Hull FC]]'s 29\u201312 victory over [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] in the [[1984 Yorkshire Cup|1984]] [[RFL Yorkshire Cup|Yorkshire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]] Final during the [[1984\u201385 Rugby Football League season|1984\u201385 season]] at [[Boothferry Park]], [[Kingston upon Hull]], on Saturday 27 October 1984. He was then chosen for Game 1 of the [[1984 State of Origin series]], but lost his place to Steve Mortimer for the rest of the series. Sterling was then overlooked for the home Ashes series against Great Britain in 1984, but would still go on to win the ''[[Rugby League Week]]'' Player of the Year award for the first time. In the [[1984 NSWRL season#Grand Final|1984 Grand Final]], Sterling and longtime partner in crime Brett Kenny had few opportunities against Mortimers Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs whose forwards dominated the Eels pack and gave the star pairing little room to move. The narrow 6\u20134 loss to the Bulldogs ended the now [[John Monie]] coached Parramatta's bid for a 4th successive premiership.\n\nSterling did not play for Parramatta, in the first half of [[1985 NSWRL season|1985]] as he returned to England to again link with Hull. Peter Sterling played {{rlp|sh}} in [[Hull F.C.|Hull FC]]'s 0\u201312 defeat by [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] in the [[1984\u201385 League Cup (rugby league)|1984\u201385]] [[League Cup (rugby league)|John Player Special Trophy]] Final during the [[1984\u201385 Rugby Football League season|1984\u201385 season]] at [[Boothferry Park]], [[Kingston upon Hull]] on Saturday 26 January 1985. Though he was relatively quiet upon his return to Parramatta, at the end of the season Sterling's skill allowed Parramatta to defeat [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] (twice, the second a 32\u20134 win in the Minor-Semi) and [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] (Minor Preliminary-Semi), to move from doubtful finalists to the Preliminary Final \u2013 where a ruthless Canterbury side on their way to a second successive premiership, easily accounted for the Eels 26\u20130. As a result of his decision to play in England and miss the first part of the NSWRL premiership, Sterling lost his place in the NSW side in the [[1985 State of Origin series]] to Steve Mortimer, who led the Blues to their first ever series win over Queensland. He also miss his chance to regain his test place for the mid-season tour of New Zealand in 1985, with the halfback role shared between Mark Murray and Manly's versatile utility [[Des Hasler]]. By missing both Origin and Test selection in 1985, Sterling missed the opportunity to link with the coach who gave him his first grade d\u00e9but at Parramatta [[Terry Fearnley]], who coached both representative teams.\n\nWhile playing for Hull in the early part of 1985, Sterling led the team into the [[Challenge Cup|1985 Challenge Cup Final]] against [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], which also included a number of internationals such as; fullback [[Gary Kemble]], wingers [[Dane O'Hara]] and [[James Leuluai]] and his halves partner [[Fred Ah Kuoi]] (all NZ), centre [[Garry Schofield]] (GB), Parramatta second-rower [[John Muggleton]] (Aus), and goal kicking forward (and Hull captain) [[Lee Crooks (rugby league)|Lee Crooks]] (GB), Sterling played {{rlp|sh}} in [[Hull F.C.|Hull FC]]'s 24\u201328 defeat by [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] in the [[1985 Challenge Cup|1985]] [[Challenge Cup]] Final during the [[1984\u201385 Rugby Football League season#Challenge Cup|1984\u201385 season]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], [[London]] on Saturday 4 May 1985, in front of a crowd of 99,801,<ref name=\"1984-1985 Challenge Cup Final\">{{cite web|url=http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=445|title=1984\u20131985 Challenge Cup Final|publisher=wigan.rlfans.com|date=31 December 2011|accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref> in what is regarded as the most marvellous cup final in living memory,<ref name=\"100 years of rugby league: From the great divide to the Super era\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/100-years-of-rugby-league-from-the-great-divide-to-the-super-era-1597130.html|title=100 years of rugby league: From the great divide to the Super era|newspaper=independent.co.uk|date=20 August 1995|accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref> which Hull narrowly lost after fighting back from 12\u201328 down at half-time, with Sterling's Parramatta halves partner Brett Kenny (playing for Wigan) was voted [[man of the match]] winning the [[Lance Todd Trophy]]. Sterling, who produced a great game in both attack and defense, had gone into the game as one of the shortest priced favourites to win the Lance Todd Trophy, with bookmakers in Hull allegedly (according to [[BBC]] commentator [[Ray French]] during the telecast of the Cup Final) refusing to field any more bets on Sterling in the week leading up to the game.\n\n1986 saw Sterling almost carry a clean sweep of the major awards \u2013 except the [[Rothmans Medal]] \u2013 and win the inaugural [[Clive Churchill Medal]] in Parramatta's fourth [[1986 NSWRL season#Grand Final|Grand Final victory]], reversing the 1984 result with a 4\u20132 win over Canterbury-Bankstown to send the retiring Mick Cronin and team captain Ray Price out as premiership winners. 1986 also saw the Parramatta with their own home ground for the first time since over-excited fans had burned down the old [[Cumberland Oval]] grandstand during the 1981 Grand Final celebrations. Between 1982 and 1985 the club was forced to play home games at Canterbury-Bankstown's home ground, the [[Belmore Sports Ground]], but in 1986 the new [[Parramatta Stadium]] was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and Sterling set about making the venue his own personal playground.\n\nDuring the year he was also part of the NSW Team which swept Qld 3\u20130 in the [[1986 State of Origin series|State of Origin series]] (the first time in series history a team had won all three games), winning man of the match in Game 2 at the SCG. After regaining his test place in the successful two test series against New Zealand, Sterling was an automatic selection for his second [[1986 Kangaroo tour|Kangaroo tour]] at the end of the season, this time going away as the undisputed number one halfback with 1985 test halfback Des Hasler.\n\nSterling won The Rothman's medal in 1987 and 1990 but only featured in one match of The 1991 season after suffering a shoulder injury.  Sterling returned to the field in 1992, but his shoulder was injured again after being hit in a hard tackle by Western Suburbs player David Gillespie.  This would prove to be Sterling's final game as he retired due to being unable to recover from the recurring shoulder problem.<ref>https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/parramatta/end-of-an-era-as-eels-bid-farewell-to-parramatta-stadium/news-story/d02542b281c516e5c6b09066666390c6</ref>\n\n==Post-playing career==\nSterling lives on the Central Coast with his wife, Selina, and 18-year-old daughter, Hannah and 21-year-old son James. The playing of golf is to his thorough enjoyment and he revels in the breeding of thoroughbreds. Sterling supports [[Liverpool F.C.]] in the [[Premier League]].\n\n===Television / Radio career===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2017}}\nSterling's sharp intelligence marked him as an astute analyst of the game with the former Eel commentating for the [[Nine Network]] after initially starting in the media with Western Sydney radio station [[101.7 WSFM|2WS]] and [[TEN (TV station)|Channel 10]] where he was a sideline commentator for their coverage of the 1987 NSWRL finals.\n\nHis autobiography, 'Sterlo! The Story of a Champion' was released in 1989.\n\nHe later went on to host ''[[The Sunday Footy Show (rugby league)|The Sunday Footy Show]]'', anchoring the program from the show's inception in 1993 until the end of the 2015 season with Sterling replaced by Yvonne Sampson from the 2016 season.\n\nSterling was also co-host of Nine's ''[[The NRL Footy Show]]'' from 1994\u20132006 alongside [[Paul Vautin]]. He made a guest appearance in 2007 on the first episode for the year to say farewell to the show before coming back for a short stint in 2010 as alternating host.\n\nHe currently hosts Nine's 'Thursday Night Football' and is a member of their commentary team, he also rotates the hosting of 'Sunday Afternoon Football' with Yvonne Sampson.\n\nSterling joined [[Triple M]] in March 2010 as an expert commentator on ''[[Monday Night Football on Triple M|Monday Night Football]]'' and is an occasional panellist on Dead Set Legends and The Rush Hour.\n\nIn March 2013, Sterling began hosting a weekly NRL show on [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] called 'Sterlo; airing on Thursday nights. His show was axed in 2014 due to poor ratings competing with The Footy Show.\n\nHe now hosts ''On the Couch with Sterlo'' which airs on Tuesday every week.\n\n===Rugby League awards===\nSince retiring from playing the game, Sterling has won several awards.\nIn 1995, Sterling was picked at halfback in a poll to judge the best Australian team since the introduction of the limited-tackle rule in 1967. He won eight of fourteen votes, with the remainder going to [[Billy Smith (rugby league)|Billy Smith]], [[Ricky Stuart]] and [[Allan Langer]].\n\nIn 2000 Sterling was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]] for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league.

She developed an interest in performing from a young age and enrolled into [[jazz dancing]] classes where she would eventually also assist teaching younger students.\n\nAt age 12, Wood's mother Judy encouraged her to take up singing by joining the ''[[Young Talent Time]]'' talent school. Her teachers quickly noticed her natural singing talent and at age 15, placed her into a show troupe \"The Young Stars\" which performed at various venues around New South Wales. During this three-year stint, Wood had her first experience of recording for an album and performing solo in front of large crowds, her biggest being the opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]] where she performed in front of over 20,000 people.\n\nDuring her schooling years, she entered and won numerous talent quests and played the lead vocal role in her 1994 school musical ''Murder in the Music Hall''. She completed her [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] in 1995, her highest mark being eighty-five percent in music and at the age of 18, became the lead singer of a cover band \"Quiver\". They performed a wide range of songs including [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Alanis Morissette]], 80's rock and more and Wood recorded original songs with the band.\n\nShe then moved to Sydney, where she enrolled in the [[Australian Institute of Music]] choosing vocal as her major, which she completed successfully, and joined another cover band \"The Anthill Mob\".\n\n===Big break===\n{{main|Bardot (Australian band)}}\nIn late 1999, at the age of 22, Wood auditioned for the first Australian series of ''[[Popstars]]'', a reality television show which aimed to produce a new [[girl group]]. After selections for the group were finalised by the judges, she just missed out. However, after original member [[Chantelle Barry]] was forced out of the group in controversial circumstances, Wood was selected to replace her as the fifth member of the band, now known as [[Bardot (Australian band)|Bardot]].\n\n''Popstars'' was one of the most popular, highest-rating television programs in Australia of 2000 and with the group's overwhelming exposure, Bardot's debut single \"[[Poison (Bardot song)|Poison]]\" and [[Bardot (album)|self-titled debut album]] both entered at number one on the Australian [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] charts, achieving multi-platinum sales. Further singles \"[[I Should've Never Let You Go]]\" and \"[[These Days (Bardot song)|These Days]]\" continued the group's successful assault on the Australian charts and in August, Bardot embarked on its first national tour. Wood performed with her bandmates at the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2001]] for which they were nominated in three categories. Promotional tours were made in numerous countries including Singapore, Taiwan, New Zealand, India and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2001, Bardot returned to the spotlight with \"[[ASAP (Bardot song)|ASAP]]\", the first single from their second album. \"ASAP\" went Top 5 as did the following single \"[[I Need Somebody]]\". In November, Bardot released its second album ''[[Play It Like That]]'', which achieved gold status upon release and performed before 90,000 music lovers at the Rumba festivals.\n\nIn early 2002, they embarked on their second national tour and released their final single \"[[Love Will Find a Way (Bardot song)|Love Will Find a Way]]\", before deciding to \"call it a day\" in April of that year. At the girl's final public concert, performed live at [[Channel V Australia|Channel [V]]], Wood broke into tears, sad at the realisation that it was all coming to an end. Later in interviews, she stated that she and former bandmate [[Belinda Chapple]] were the two members keen to continue as a group.\n\n===Solo career===\nLike former Bardot bandmate [[Sophie Monk]], Wood signed a solo [[recording contract]] with [[Warner Music]] and changed her name from Tiffany Wood to Tiffani Wood in order to avoid confusion with the 1980s American popstar [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]]. The debut single, \"[[What R U Waiting 4]]\" re-introduced Wood back into the music scene, marketed as an organic, light pop-rock singer (similar to the likes of [[Michelle Branch]], [[Alanis Morissette]] etc.). The track debuted at No.27 on the ARIA singles chart on 22 March 2004 <ref>[http://acharts.us/australia_singles_top_50/2004/13 acharts] Australia Singles Top 50 \u2013 Monday 22 March 2004</ref> and was one of the most-played songs on Australian radio in that month.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, tensions between Wood and Warner Music grew. Wood insisted that the second single be a self-penned track but Warner Music already planned on releasing someone else's song as the next single. After failing to reach a compromise, Wood made the decision to leave behind her recording contract for the option of artistic freedom and ultimate career control.\n\nIn 2005, after leaving Warner Music, Wood decided to release her material independently and established her own record label Mudhoney Records. The first single \"[[Devil in Your Soul]]\" was released on 18 July and showcased a harder, fast-paced rock sound with electrical guitars, strong drum beats and a saucy vocal performance by Wood. The tongue-in-cheek lyrics, written by Wood and Richie Goncalves (who produced the song) took a stab at the music industry and how major record labels take advantage of their younger artists in order to make them 'marketable'. The single debuted at No.13 on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061116181341/http://www.air.org.au/index.php Association of Independent Records Labels] [[AIR Charts|(AIR) chart]] and spent numerous weeks in the top 20.\n\nIn April 2006, Wood released her second independent single \"[[Spin the Bottle (Tiffani Wood song)|Spin the Bottle]]\" with a number of promotional commitments including a performance on the [[Seven Network]]'s top-rating breakfast television program ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]''. The song also featured in promotions for long-time Australian soap ''[[Neighbours]]'' in the lead up to the [[Logie Awards of 2006|2006 TV Week Logie Awards]]. The single was a success on the AIR charts, debuting in top 5 and eventually peaking at #2.\n\nWood has established a strong reputation for her live performances, headlining shows at nightclubs and numerous events across the country. In 2006, she put together a [[American burlesque|burlesque]]-styled show, drawing inspiration from the 1940s and [[Dita Von Teese]] for her latest look and style of performance. In July 2006, Wood appeared in a [[nude]] photoshoot for nude-art magazine [[Black+White]]\n\nIn September 2006, she released an up-beat [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Divinyls]] 1990 number one hit \"[[I Touch Myself#Tiffani Wood version|I Touch Myself]]\", receiving generally positive reviews. The single peaked at No.5 on the ARIA charts and was performed on the [[ARL Footy Show]].\n\nHer debut solo album ''[[Bite Your Tongue]]'' was released in October 2006 and features a collection of self-penned rock-pop songs touching on issues such as body image, falling asleep behind the wheel and the entertainment industry. Respected music critic Cameron Adams gave the album three stars, crediting Wood for her \"powerful voice\" and describing the record as \"sassy\".\n\nIn 2007, Tiffani Wood appeared in the stage musical ''Las Vegas Confidential \u2013 The Musical''. In 2009 she reunited with [[Katie Underwood]] in the stage show ''Valentino''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,,24873742-16601,00.html | title=Bardot's Tiffani and Katie unite | date=5 January 2009 | work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n\n===Personal life===\nIn December 2005, Wood publicly announced her engagement to UK born bouncer Neil Cummins, and the couple married on 28 January 2007.<ref>[http://www.hens.com.au/features/celebrity-hen/tiffani%20wood Hens.com.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828104752/http://www.hens.com.au/features/celebrity-hen/tiffani%20wood |date=28 August 2008 }}</ref> Photos from their wedding featured in ''[[OK!]]'' magazine.

She and son Henry edited the Republican in 1887\u201388, which was printed on an old press in Louisa's cottage. The Republican called for an Australian republic uniting under 'the flag of a Federated Australia, the Great Republic of the Southern Seas'.

''The Dawn'' had a strong feminist perspective and frequently addressed issues such as women's right to vote and assume public office, women's education, women's economic and legal rights, [[domestic violence]], and [[Temperance movement|temperance]]. ''The Dawn'' was published monthly for 17 years (1888\u20131905) and at its height employed 10 female staff. Lawson's son Henry also contributed poems and stories for the paper, and in 1894 ''The Dawn'' press printed Henry's first book, ''Short Stories in Prose and Verse''.\n\nAround 1904 Louisa published her own volume, ''Dert and Do'', a simple story of 18,000 words.<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12297868 National Library of Australia, ''\"Dert\" and \"Do\"'', by Louisa Lawson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024195335/http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12297868 |date=24 October 2012 }}, accessed 22 February 2011.</ref> In 1905 she collected and published her own verses, ''The Lonely Crossing and other Poems''.<ref>[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/5749571 National Library of Australia, ''The lonely crossing and other poems'', by Louisa Lawson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024195400/http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/5749571 |date=24 October 2012 }}, accessed 22 February 2011.</ref> Louisa likely had a strong influence on her son's literary work in its earliest days.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==Suffragist==\n\nIn 1889 Lawson founded The Dawn Club, which became the hub of the suffrage movement in Sydney. In 1891 the [[Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales]] formed to campaign for women's suffrage, and Lawson allowed the League to use the Dawn office to print pamphlets and literature free of charge. When women were finally given the vote, in 1902 with the passing of the New South Wales ''Womanhood Suffrage Bill'', Lawson was introduced to the members of Parliament as 'The Mother of Suffrage in New South Wales'.

''The Dawn'' had a strong feminist perspective and frequently addressed issues such as women's right to vote and assume public office, women's education, women's economic and legal rights, [[domestic violence]], and [[Temperance movement|temperance]]. ''The Dawn'' was published monthly for 17 years (1888\u20131905) and at its height employed 10 female staff.
