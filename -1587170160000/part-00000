See also [[list of bridge\u2013tunnels]] for another list of fixed links including links across rivers, bays and lakes.\n\n==History==\n\n===Cosmopolitan Railway===\nIn 1890 [[William Gilpin (governor)|William Gilpin]] first proposed to connect the continents by land via the [[Cosmopolitan Railway]].  Significant elements of that proposal, such as the English [[Channel Tunnel]], have been constructed since that era. However, the improvement of the global shipping industry and advent of international air travel has reduced the demand for many intercontinental land connections.\n\n===Trans Global Highway===\nThe Trans-Global Highway<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.TransGlobalHighway.org | title=Trans Global Highway | accessdate=June 1, 2016}}</ref> is a range of highway systems proposed by futurist Frank X. Didik<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.didik.com | title=Didik | accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref> that would link all six of the [[Continent#Area and population|inhabited continents]]. People from New York could drive to London via Greenland. The highway would network new and existing bridges and tunnels, improving ground transportation and potentially providing a conduit for utility pipelines.<ref name=TransGlobal>{{cite web | url=http://www.transglobalhighway.com/ | publisher=Frank Didik | accessdate=14 July 2007 | title=Proposal for a Trans-Global Highway | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424004355/http://transglobalhighway.com/ | archive-date=24 April 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> However, in the ''Discovery Channel's'' \"Extreme Engineering\", it was noted that the [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]] area is mostly roadless and uninhabited, and infrastructure would need to be developed completely from scratch. Chukotka is on the Eurasian side of the Bering Strait, where the highway would connect to North America via tunnels.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Europe==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n===English Channel===\n{{Main|Channel Tunnel}}\nThere is no highway connection between Great Britain and the European mainland; only a rail connection, the Channel tunnel.\n\nA cross channel rail tunnel was first proposed in 1802 and construction actually started in 1881 before being abandoned. Roll-on Roll-off ferry services provided links across the channel for vehicles.\n\nA road tunnel was proposed in 1979, but not considered viable. Construction of the Channel Tunnel started in 1988 and the tunnel opened in 1994. Automobiles and [[lorry|lorries]]/[[transport truck]]s are loaded onto the [[Eurotunnel Shuttle]]'s [[car shuttle train|enclosed railway cars]] (similar to [[auto rack]]/[[motorail]] railway cars) for the trip through the tunnel, however. A service tunnel runs the entire length of the crossing, but is closed to general use and used only during emergencies and for maintenance.\n\n===Irish Sea===\nVarious ferry services link Ireland to Britain and France. A number of options for an [[Irish Sea fixed crossing]] have been proposed over the years but none are currently under serious consideration.\n\n===Germany to Denmark to Sweden===\n[[Image:Ostseequerungen.JPG|thumb|400px|right|The Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link (green) and the '''Gedser-Rostock bridge''' (orange) in the Danish-German motorway system]]\nThe [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] links southern [[Sweden]] to the Danish island of [[Zealand]]. Zealand is linked to the Danish mainland and the rest of Europe by the [[Great Belt Fixed Link]]. Most travellers between Sweden and Germany, both by road and train use the 160&nbsp;km (100&nbsp;mi) shorter route with a ferry over the [[Fehmarn Belt]] southwestwards towards [[Hamburg]] or southwards  to [[Rostock]]. A [[Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link]] is planned to be opened in 2028. A [[Gedser-Rostock Bridge]] is also under consideration.\n\n===Sweden to Finland===\n[[Viking Line|Ferry services]] link [[Sweden]] to [[Finland]] via the [[\u00c5land Islands]]. There are proposals of fixed links between Sweden and Finland. A tunnel could be built between Sweden and \u00c5land, about {{cvt|50|km|||}} long, and {{cvt|100-200|m|||}} deep, with the lowest depth around [[M\u00e4rket]], a little detour. The area between \u00c5land and Finland is shallow with many islands, able to be connected with bridges. Between [[Ume\u00e5]] and [[Vaasa]] further north, there is a proposal to build the [[Kvarken Bridge]], a series of bridges, the longest {{cvt|26|km|||}}, in total {{cvt|40|km|||}}. None of these proposals have been seriously investigated.\n\n===Finland to Estonia===\nFerry Services link [[Finland]] to [[Estonia]] as well as overground rail and road routes via [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia. [[Rail Baltica]] is a proposal for a rail link from Finland to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, bypassing Russia via a [[Helsinki to Tallinn Tunnel]]. The [[gulf of Finland|gulf]] has heavy ferry traffic, and the [[port of Helsinki]] has the largest number of international passengers of any port in Europe, and most travel to Tallinn or back.\n\n===Italian mainland to Sicily===\nThe [[Strait of Messina]] has a busy ferry traffic. The [[Strait of Messina Bridge]] is planned, but the construction date has been postponed several times.\n\n==Europe to Africa==\n\n===Gibraltar Tunnel===\n{{Main|Strait of Gibraltar crossing}}\nThe [[Gibraltar Tunnel]] is proposed to be a rail tunnel linking Africa and Europe. Due to the depth of the Strait of Gibraltar (300\u2013900 metres / 1000\u20132950 feet), it would be a great challenge to remove automobile exhaust from this depth. Any tunnel would most likely be an electrified rail tunnel, similar to the Channel Tunnel linking the UK and France. There have also been proposals for a bridge over the Strait. There are car ferries across the strait.\n\n===Strait of Sicily===\nThe proposed [[Strait of Sicily Tunnel]] would link [[Sicily]] to [[Tunisia]]. Together with the proposed [[Strait of Messina Bridge]] from Sicily to [[Italy]] this would provide a fixed link between Italy and Tunisia.\n\n==Europe to Asia==\n\nThe [[Turkish Straits]] are the channel between European [[Turkey]] and Asian Turkey and consist of the (from south to north) the [[Dardanelles]], the [[Sea of Marmara]] and the [[Bosphorus]]\n\n===The Bosphorus===\n[[File:Rumeli hisari.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] (1988) as seen from the [[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumelian Castle]] (1452)]]\n[[File:Bosphorus Bridge-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bosphorus Bridge]] (1973)]]\n\nThree [[suspension bridge]]s cross the Bosphorus. The first of these, the [[Bosphorus Bridge]], is {{convert|1074|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long and was completed in 1973.

The [[\u00c7anakkale 1915 Bridge]] is currently under construction between the cities of [[Gelibolu]] and [[Lapseki]].\n\n=== Kerch Strait ===\nThe [[Crimean Bridge]] is a pair of parallel bridges constructed by the Russian Federation, to span the Strait of Kerch between the Taman Peninsula of Krasnodar Krai (Russia) and the Kerch Peninsula of Crimea (Russian-annexed, internationally recognised as part of Ukraine). The bridge complex provides for both vehicular traffic and for rail. With the length of 18.1&nbsp;km (11.2&nbsp;mi), it is the longest bridge in both Russia and Europe.\n\n==Africa to Arabia==\n\n===Saudi-Egypt Causeway===\nThe [[Saudi-Egypt Causeway]] is a proposal for a causeway and bridge between the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in Egypt and the northern part of [[Saudi Arabia]]. This would provide a direct road route between Egypt and Saudi Arabia without going through Israel or Jordan. There is a car ferry between [[Safaga]], Egypt and [[Duba, Saudi Arabia]].\n\n===Bridge of the Horns===\nThe [[Bridge of the Horns]] is a proposed construction project to build a bridge between the coasts of [[Djibouti]] and [[Yemen]] across the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]], the strait between the [[Red Sea]] and [[Gulf of Aden]].<ref>[http://enr.construction.com/news/intl/archives/070501.asp Notice-to-Proceed Launches Ambitious Red Sea Crossing \u2013 ENR | McGraw-Hill Construction]</ref> There is currently no ferry services on this route as of 2018.\n\n==Asia==\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nThe [[Boat Mail]] train and ferry service provided a train and ferry service from [[India]] to [[Sri Lanka]] until the First World War. An [[India\u2013Sri Lanka HVDC Interconnection]] is under consideration to link the electricity networks of these countries.\n\n===South East Asian islands===\nMainland [[Peninsular Malaysia]] is linked to [[Penang Island]] by two road bridges: the [[Penang Bridge]] and the [[Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah Bridge]] (Penang Second Bridge). To the south, it is linked to [[Singapore Island]] across the [[Straits of Johor]] by the [[Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway]] and the [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore Second Link]]; the former also carries Malaysia's [[West Coast Line (Malaysia)|West Coast Line]] to the island.\n\nPassenger and vehicle ferries link the various islands of [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Philippines]].\n\nThere are proposals to link [[Java]], the most populated Island of [[Indonesia]], to [[Sumatra]] via a proposed [[Sunda Strait Bridge]] and from Sumatra to [[Singapore]] and/or [[Malaysia]] via a [[Malacca Strait Bridge]].\n\n===Hainan Island===\nThe Guangdong\u2013Hainan Ferry, or the Yuehai Ferry (part of the [[Guangdong\u2013Hainan Railway]]) <ref>'''Yue''' \u7ca4 is the standard Chinese abbreviation for Guangdong, and '''Hai''' \u6d77, for Hainan.</ref> is a vehicle and [[Train ferry]] connecting [[Hainan]] Island to [[Guangdong]] in mainland [[China]]. The ferries run across the [[Qiongzhou Strait]], between [[Zhanjiang]], Guangdong and [[Haikou]], Hainan.\n\n===Taiwan===\nThe [[Taiwan Strait Tunnel Project]] is a proposed [[undersea tunnel]] to connect [[Pingtan County|Pingtan]] in China to [[Hsinchu]] in northern [[Taiwan]] as part of the [[G3 Beijing\u2013Taipei Expressway]]. First proposed in 1996,<ref name=\"Basalt\">{{cite web | title = Large basalt reef may make Taiwan Strait Tunnel come true | publisher = Whats On Xiamen | date = 25 November 2009 | url = http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news8663.html | accessdate = 22 February 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110312053027/http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news8663.html | archive-date = 12 March 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref> the project has since been subject to a number of academic discussions and feasibility studies, including by the [[China Railway Engineering Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Discussion on Options of Taiwan Strait Crossing Project and Qiongzhou Strait Crossing Project by 9 Academicians held in Luoyang, China: Several of Them Agree with Tunnel Option | publisher = China Civil Engineering Society | date = 26 April 2011 | url = http://www.cces-tuwb.com/En/shownews.asp?id=408 | accessdate = 22 February 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130718020525/http://www.cces-tuwb.com/En/shownews.asp?id=408 | archive-date = 18 July 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref>  There exist cross strait ferries, both within outlying island of Taiwan and between PRC and Taiwan.\n\n===South Korea===\nSince the [[Korean War]] travel overland from [[South Korea]] through [[North Korea]] to [[China]] and [[Russia]] has been blocked, South Korea maintains ferry services to Japan and China.\n\n===Korea to Japan===\nThe \"[[Japan\u2013Korea Undersea Tunnel|Korea Japan Friendship Tunnel System]],\" is a proposal for a fixed link from the city of [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] on [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], Japan, to the port city of [[Busan]] in Korea via four islands. The maximum ocean depth in this area is 146 m (480 feet). Similar proposals have been discussed for decades by Korean and Japanese politicians. A road bridge links Ky\u016bsh\u016b to the main Japanese island of [[Honshu]].\n\n===Japan to Russia===\nThe [[Seikan Tunnel]] has provided a rail link from the main Japanese Island of [[Honshu]] to the northernmost Japanese island of [[Hokkaido]] since 1988. The proposed [[Sakhalin-Hokkaido Tunnel]] would link Hokkaido to the Russian island of [[Sakhalin]]. When combined with the proposed [[Sakhalin Tunnel]] between Sakhalin and the Russian Mainland and an extension of the [[Baikal Amur Mainline]] this would give a rail link from Japan to [[Russia]] and the mainland of Asia.\n\n===Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge===\nThe [[Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge]] links [[Hong Kong]], [[Zhuhai]] and [[Macau]] in [[China]]. Opened on October 24, 2018, it is the longest fixed crossing in the world.\n\n==Asia to America==\n\n===Bering Strait bridge or tunnel===\n{{Main|Bering Strait crossing}}\nThere is a proposal is to span the [[Bering Sea]] with a bridge or tunnel called the '''Intercontinental Peace Bridge''', the '''TKM-World Link''' or the '''AmerAsian Peace Tunnel'''. This would link the [[United States|American]] [[Cape Prince of Wales]], with the [[Russia]]n [[Cape Dezhnev]]. The Bering Strait Tunnel would consist of 3 tunnels connecting [[Alaska]] and Russia by going through two islands (the [[Diomede Islands|Little Diomede (USA)]] and [[Diomede Islands|Big Diomede (Russia)]]).  The longest single tunnel would be 24&nbsp;miles (40&nbsp;km).  Since the [[Bering Sea]] at the proposed crossing has a maximum known depth of 170 feet (50 m), the tunnels might be dug with conventional [[tunnel boring machine]]s of the type that was employed in the construction of the Channel Tunnel. The three tunnel proposal is considered to be preferable over a bridge due to severe environmental conditions, especially the inescapable winter ice damage.\n\nEach proposed tunnel would be shorter than some current tunnels. The Channel tunnel linking England with mainland Europe is approximately 31.34&nbsp;miles (50.45&nbsp;km) long; the ocean tunnel [[Seikan Tunnel]] linking [[Hokkaido]] with [[Honshu]] in Japan is 33.46&nbsp;miles (55.86&nbsp;km) long; and the Swiss [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]] through the [[Alps]], opened in 2016, is 35.7&nbsp;miles (59.60&nbsp;km) long.<ref name=\"TransGlobal\"/>\n\nTo make a bridge or tunnel useful, a road or railway must be built to connect it, despite very difficult climate and very sparse population that makes roads less economically motivated.  In Alaska a 700&nbsp;mile (1,100&nbsp;km) link would be needed, and in Russia a link more than 1,200&nbsp;miles (2,000&nbsp;km) long must be constructed. Until around 2010 such road connections were suggested by enthusiasts only, but at that time both the Russian government and the Alaskan state government started considering such roads.\n\n==The Americas==\n\n===Vancouver Island===\n[[BC Ferries|Ferry services]] link [[Vancouver Island]] to [[British Columbia]] on the [[Canada|Canadian Mainland]] and to the [[State of Washington]] in the [[US]].\n\nProposals have been made for a [[Strait of Georgia#Georgia Strait bridge proposal|fixed link]] to Vancouver Island for over a century. Because of the extreme depth and soft seabed of the Georgia Strait, and the potential for seismic activity, a bridge or tunnel would face monumental engineering, safety, and environmental challenges at a prohibitive cost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/reports_and_studies/fixed_link/fixed_link.htm |title=A Potential Fixed Link to Vancouver Island - Ministry of Transportation |publisher=Th.gov.bc.ca |accessdate=2010-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821203226/http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/Publications/reports_and_studies/fixed_link/fixed_link.htm |archivedate=2010-08-21 }}</ref>\n\n===Prince Edward Island===\n[[Prince Edward Island]] is linked to [[New Brunswick]] on the Canadian mainland by the [[Confederation Bridge]] which opened in 1997.\n\n===Newfoundland===\nVarious proposals have been considered for a [[Newfoundland-Labrador fixed link|fixed link]] consisting of bridges, tunnels, and/or causeways across the Strait of Belle Isle, connecting the province of Newfoundland and Labrador's mainland Labrador region with the island of Newfoundland. This strait has a minimum width of 17.4&nbsp;km (10.8&nbsp;mi).\n\n===Long Island===\nNine bridges and 13 tunnels (including railroad tunnels) connect the [[New York City]] boroughs of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]], on [[Long Island]], to [[Manhattan]] and [[Staten Island]] and, via these, to [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] in [[New Jersey]] and [[The Bronx]] on the mainland of [[New York (state)|New York]] state. However, no fixed crossing of the [[Long Island Sound]] exists east of New York City; most traffic from the mainland United States must pass through the city to access Long Island. Passenger and auto ferries connect [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] on Long Island northward across the Sound to the mainland of [[New York (state)|New York]] state and westward to the state of [[Connecticut]]. There have been various proposals, none successful, to replace these ferries with a [[Long Island Sound link|fixed link across Long Island Sound]] to provide an alternate route around New York City for Long Island-bound traffic.\n\n===Delmarva===\nThe [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel]] (CBBT) is a 23-mile-long (37&nbsp;km) fixed link crossing the mouth of the United States' Chesapeake Bay, connecting the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] with [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. It opened in 1964.\n\n===Florida to Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico===\nFerry services between the US and Cuba and between Cuba and Haiti have been suspended due to the ongoing [[United States embargo against Cuba]].\n\nThere's only one regular ferry to Havana from a foreign port: [[Canc\u00fan]], [[Mexico]].<ref>[http://www.travelcubacaribbean.com/cruise/cruise.asp]</ref>\n\nThere is a ferry that travels between [[Mayag\u00fcez]] in [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Santo Domingo]] in the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref>[http://www.ferriesdelcaribe.com/ingles/]</ref>\n\n===Dari\u00e9n Gap===\n{{Main|Dari\u00e9n Gap}}\nA notable break in the [[Pan-American Highway]] is a section of land located in the [[Dari\u00e9n Province]] in Panama and the [[Colombia]]n border called the [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]]. It is an {{convert|87|km|mi|adj=on}} stretch of rainforest. The gap has been crossed by adventurers on bicycle, motorcycle, [[all-terrain vehicle]], and foot, dealing with jungle, swamp, insects, kidnapping and other hazards.\n\nSome people, groups, indigenous populations, and governments are opposed to completing the Dari\u00e9n portion of the highway. Reasons for opposition include protecting the rain forest, containing the spread of tropical diseases, protecting the livelihood of indigenous peoples in the area, and reducing the spread of drug trafficking and its associated violence from Colombia.\n\n==Transatlantic tunnel==\n{{Main|Transatlantic tunnel}}\nA '''transatlantic tunnel''' is a theoretical [[tunnel]] that would span the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] possibly for such purposes as [[mass transit]].

Lin mentions the possible construction of a Bering Strait bridge (and obviously a needed highway network).\n* Alaska History: A Publication of the Alaska Historical Society, Volumes 4-6 (1989)  mentions on page 6 that in 1892, a man named Strauss proposed a global highway and a man made bridge over the Bering Strait.  The article goes on to mention the Lin proposal of 1958.\n* \"Maritime Information Review\"  a publication of the Netherlands Maritime Information Centre,  in 1991 had an extensive article, on \"strait crossings\" covering the then proposed Bering Strait bridge, the Gibraltar Tunnel and so on, and mentions the proposed global highway network.\n* Popular Mechanics Apr 1994 has an article \"Alaska Siberia Bridge\" and the article goes on to mention the construction of a global highway.\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120424004355/http://transglobalhighway.com/   Didik's original Trans-Global Highway proposal]\n* [http://www.didik.com/highway/tgwmap2.jpg Map of its route]\n* [http://www.schillerinstitute.org/economy/maps/maps3.html#bering%20straits   The Schiller Institute article on the Trans Global Highway]\n* [http://wikivoyage.org/ Wikivoyage], Wikimedia's global travel guide with information on driving in each country\n\n[[Category:Exploratory engineering]]\n[[Category:Transportation planning]]\n[[Category:Proposed undersea tunnels]]\n[[Category:Proposed bridges]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Permanent road/rail connections between continents.}}\nA '''fixed link''' or '''fixed crossing''' is a persistent, unbroken [[road]] or [[railroad|rail]] connection across water that uses some combination of [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, and [[causeway]]s and does not involve intermittent connections such as [[drawbridge]]s or [[ferry|ferries]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ostenfeld| first1=Klaus H.| last2=Hommel| first2=Dietrich| last3=Olsen| first3=Dan| last4=Hauge| first4=Lars| date=Nov 4, 1999|chapter=Planning of Major Fixed Links| editor1-last=Chen| editor1-first=Wai-Fah| editor2-last=Lian| editor2-first=Duan| title=Bridge Engineering Handbook| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxYKgLVnT8YC|publisher=[[CRC Press]]| page=4-1| isbn=0-8493-7434-0}}</ref> A [[bridge\u2013tunnel]] combination is commonly used for major fixed links.\n\nThis is a list of proposed and actual transport links between continents and to offshore islands.

Significant elements of that proposal, such as the English [[Channel Tunnel]], have been constructed since that era. However, the improvement of the global shipping industry and advent of international air travel has reduced the demand for many intercontinental land connections.\n\n===Trans Global Highway===\nThe Trans-Global Highway<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.TransGlobalHighway.org | title=Trans Global Highway | accessdate=June 1, 2016}}</ref> is a range of highway systems proposed by futurist Frank X. Didik<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.didik.com | title=Didik | accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref> that would link all six of the [[Continent#Area and population|inhabited continents]].

Chukotka is on the Eurasian side of the Bering Strait, where the highway would connect to North America via tunnels.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Europe==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n===English Channel===\n{{Main|Channel Tunnel}}\nThere is no highway connection between Great Britain and the European mainland; only a rail connection, the Channel tunnel.\n\nA cross channel rail tunnel was first proposed in 1802 and construction actually started in 1881 before being abandoned. Roll-on Roll-off ferry services provided links across the channel for vehicles.\n\nA road tunnel was proposed in 1979, but not considered viable. Construction of the Channel Tunnel started in 1988 and the tunnel opened in 1994. Automobiles and [[lorry|lorries]]/[[transport truck]]s are loaded onto the [[Eurotunnel Shuttle]]'s [[car shuttle train|enclosed railway cars]] (similar to [[auto rack]]/[[motorail]] railway cars) for the trip through the tunnel, however. A service tunnel runs the entire length of the crossing, but is closed to general use and used only during emergencies and for maintenance.\n\n===Irish Sea===\nVarious ferry services link Ireland to Britain and France. A number of options for an [[Irish Sea fixed crossing]] have been proposed over the years but none are currently under serious consideration.\n\n===Germany to Denmark to Sweden===\n[[Image:Ostseequerungen.JPG|thumb|400px|right|The Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link (green) and the '''Gedser-Rostock bridge''' (orange) in the Danish-German motorway system]]\nThe [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] links southern [[Sweden]] to the Danish island of [[Zealand]]. Zealand is linked to the Danish mainland and the rest of Europe by the [[Great Belt Fixed Link]]. Most travellers between Sweden and Germany, both by road and train use the 160&nbsp;km (100&nbsp;mi) shorter route with a ferry over the [[Fehmarn Belt]] southwestwards towards [[Hamburg]] or southwards  to [[Rostock]]. A [[Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link]] is planned to be opened in 2028. A [[Gedser-Rostock Bridge]] is also under consideration.\n\n===Sweden to Finland===\n[[Viking Line|Ferry services]] link [[Sweden]] to [[Finland]] via the [[\u00c5land Islands]]. There are proposals of fixed links between Sweden and Finland. A tunnel could be built between Sweden and \u00c5land, about {{cvt|50|km|||}} long, and {{cvt|100-200|m|||}} deep, with the lowest depth around [[M\u00e4rket]], a little detour. The area between \u00c5land and Finland is shallow with many islands, able to be connected with bridges. Between [[Ume\u00e5]] and [[Vaasa]] further north, there is a proposal to build the [[Kvarken Bridge]], a series of bridges, the longest {{cvt|26|km|||}}, in total {{cvt|40|km|||}}. None of these proposals have been seriously investigated.\n\n===Finland to Estonia===\nFerry Services link [[Finland]] to [[Estonia]] as well as overground rail and road routes via [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia. [[Rail Baltica]] is a proposal for a rail link from Finland to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, bypassing Russia via a [[Helsinki to Tallinn Tunnel]]. The [[gulf of Finland|gulf]] has heavy ferry traffic, and the [[port of Helsinki]] has the largest number of international passengers of any port in Europe, and most travel to Tallinn or back.\n\n===Italian mainland to Sicily===\nThe [[Strait of Messina]] has a busy ferry traffic. The [[Strait of Messina Bridge]] is planned, but the construction date has been postponed several times.\n\n==Europe to Africa==\n\n===Gibraltar Tunnel===\n{{Main|Strait of Gibraltar crossing}}\nThe [[Gibraltar Tunnel]] is proposed to be a rail tunnel linking Africa and Europe. Due to the depth of the Strait of Gibraltar (300\u2013900 metres / 1000\u20132950 feet), it would be a great challenge to remove automobile exhaust from this depth. Any tunnel would most likely be an electrified rail tunnel, similar to the Channel Tunnel linking the UK and France. There have also been proposals for a bridge over the Strait. There are car ferries across the strait.\n\n===Strait of Sicily===\nThe proposed [[Strait of Sicily Tunnel]] would link [[Sicily]] to [[Tunisia]]. Together with the proposed [[Strait of Messina Bridge]] from Sicily to [[Italy]] this would provide a fixed link between Italy and Tunisia.\n\n==Europe to Asia==\n\nThe [[Turkish Straits]] are the channel between European [[Turkey]] and Asian Turkey and consist of the (from south to north) the [[Dardanelles]], the [[Sea of Marmara]] and the [[Bosphorus]]\n\n===The Bosphorus===\n[[File:Rumeli hisari.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] (1988) as seen from the [[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumelian Castle]] (1452)]]\n[[File:Bosphorus Bridge-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bosphorus Bridge]] (1973)]]\n\nThree [[suspension bridge]]s cross the Bosphorus.

The [[\u00c7anakkale 1915 Bridge]] is currently under construction between the cities of [[Gelibolu]] and [[Lapseki]].\n\n=== Kerch Strait ===\nThe [[Crimean Bridge]] is a pair of parallel bridges constructed by the Russian Federation, to span the Strait of Kerch between the Taman Peninsula of Krasnodar Krai (Russia) and the Kerch Peninsula of Crimea (Russian-annexed, internationally recognised as part of Ukraine). The bridge complex provides for both vehicular traffic and for rail. With the length of 18.1&nbsp;km (11.2&nbsp;mi), it is the longest bridge in both Russia and Europe.\n\n==Africa to Arabia==\n\n===Saudi-Egypt Causeway===\nThe [[Saudi-Egypt Causeway]] is a proposal for a causeway and bridge between the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in Egypt and the northern part of [[Saudi Arabia]]. This would provide a direct road route between Egypt and Saudi Arabia without going through Israel or Jordan. There is a car ferry between [[Safaga]], Egypt and [[Duba, Saudi Arabia]].\n\n===Bridge of the Horns===\nThe [[Bridge of the Horns]] is a proposed construction project to build a bridge between the coasts of [[Djibouti]] and [[Yemen]] across the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]], the strait between the [[Red Sea]] and [[Gulf of Aden]].<ref>[http://enr.construction.com/news/intl/archives/070501.asp Notice-to-Proceed Launches Ambitious Red Sea Crossing \u2013 ENR | McGraw-Hill Construction]</ref> There is currently no ferry services on this route as of 2018.\n\n==Asia==\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nThe [[Boat Mail]] train and ferry service provided a train and ferry service from [[India]] to [[Sri Lanka]] until the First World War. An [[India\u2013Sri Lanka HVDC Interconnection]] is under consideration to link the electricity networks of these countries.\n\n===South East Asian islands===\nMainland [[Peninsular Malaysia]] is linked to [[Penang Island]] by two road bridges: the [[Penang Bridge]] and the [[Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah Bridge]] (Penang Second Bridge). To the south, it is linked to [[Singapore Island]] across the [[Straits of Johor]] by the [[Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway]] and the [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore Second Link]]; the former also carries Malaysia's [[West Coast Line (Malaysia)|West Coast Line]] to the island.\n\nPassenger and vehicle ferries link the various islands of [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Papua New Guinea]].\n\nThere are proposals to link [[Java]], the most populated Island of [[Indonesia]], to [[Sumatra]] via a proposed [[Sunda Strait Bridge]] and from Sumatra to [[Singapore]] and/or [[Malaysia]] via a [[Malacca Strait Bridge]].\n\n===Australia-Papua New Guinea Tunnel===\nA [[Submerged floating tunnel#Indonesia|tunnel/bridge]] between the Australian mainland and the island of [[New Guinea]], bridging the [[Torres Strait]], is not considered economically feasible owing to the great distance. [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in northern Queensland is 140&nbsp;km away from [[New Guinea]]. This is a very long distance compared to existing tunnels or bridges, and the demand for car travel is not so high; as of 2009<ref>[http://forum.virtualtourist.com/discussion-475279-1-1-Travel-0-0-Papua_New_Guinea-discussion.html Australia PNG Indonesia by ship/ ferry]</ref> there are no car ferries between Australia and Papua New Guinea.

The maximum ocean depth in this area is 146 m (480 feet). Similar proposals have been discussed for decades by Korean and Japanese politicians. A road bridge links Ky\u016bsh\u016b to the main Japanese island of [[Honshu]].\n\n===Japan to Russia===\nThe [[Seikan Tunnel]] has provided a rail link from the main Japanese Island of [[Honshu]] to the northernmost Japanese island of [[Hokkaido]] since 1988. The proposed [[Sakhalin-Hokkaido Tunnel]] would link Hokkaido to the Russian island of [[Sakhalin]]. When combined with the proposed [[Sakhalin Tunnel]] between Sakhalin and the Russian Mainland and an extension of the [[Baikal Amur Mainline]] this would give a rail link from Japan to [[Russia]] and the mainland of Asia.\n\n===Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge===\nThe [[Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge]] links [[Hong Kong]], [[Zhuhai]] and [[Macau]] in [[China]]. Opened on October 24, 2018, it is the longest fixed crossing in the world.\n\n==Asia to America==\n\n===Bering Strait bridge or tunnel===\n{{Main|Bering Strait crossing}}\nThere is a proposal is to span the [[Bering Sea]] with a bridge or tunnel called the '''Intercontinental Peace Bridge''', the '''TKM-World Link''' or the '''AmerAsian Peace Tunnel'''. This would link the [[United States|American]] [[Cape Prince of Wales]], with the [[Russia]]n [[Cape Dezhnev]]. The Bering Strait Tunnel would consist of 3 tunnels connecting [[Alaska]] and Russia by going through two islands (the [[Diomede Islands|Little Diomede (USA)]] and [[Diomede Islands|Big Diomede (Russia)]]).  The longest single tunnel would be 24&nbsp;miles (40&nbsp;km).  Since the [[Bering Sea]] at the proposed crossing has a maximum known depth of 170 feet (50 m), the tunnels might be dug with conventional [[tunnel boring machine]]s of the type that was employed in the construction of the Channel Tunnel. The three tunnel proposal is considered to be preferable over a bridge due to severe environmental conditions, especially the inescapable winter ice damage.\n\nEach proposed tunnel would be shorter than some current tunnels. The Channel tunnel linking England with mainland Europe is approximately 31.34&nbsp;miles (50.45&nbsp;km) long; the ocean tunnel [[Seikan Tunnel]] linking [[Hokkaido]] with [[Honshu]] in Japan is 33.46&nbsp;miles (55.86&nbsp;km) long; and the Swiss [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]] through the [[Alps]], opened in 2016, is 35.7&nbsp;miles (59.60&nbsp;km) long.<ref name=\"TransGlobal\"/>\n\nTo make a bridge or tunnel useful, a road or railway must be built to connect it, despite very difficult climate and very sparse population that makes roads less economically motivated.  In Alaska a 700&nbsp;mile (1,100&nbsp;km) link would be needed, and in Russia a link more than 1,200&nbsp;miles (2,000&nbsp;km) long must be constructed. Until around 2010 such road connections were suggested by enthusiasts only, but at that time both the Russian government and the Alaskan state government started considering such roads.\n\n==The Americas==\n\n===Vancouver Island===\n[[BC Ferries|Ferry services]] link [[Vancouver Island]] to [[British Columbia]] on the [[Canada|Canadian Mainland]] and to the [[State of Washington]] in the [[US]].\n\nProposals have been made for a [[Strait of Georgia#Georgia Strait bridge proposal|fixed link]] to Vancouver Island for over a century. Because of the extreme depth and soft seabed of the Georgia Strait, and the potential for seismic activity, a bridge or tunnel would face monumental engineering, safety, and environmental challenges at a prohibitive cost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/reports_and_studies/fixed_link/fixed_link.htm |title=A Potential Fixed Link to Vancouver Island - Ministry of Transportation |publisher=Th.gov.bc.ca |accessdate=2010-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821203226/http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/Publications/reports_and_studies/fixed_link/fixed_link.htm |archivedate=2010-08-21 }}</ref>\n\n===Prince Edward Island===\n[[Prince Edward Island]] is linked to [[New Brunswick]] on the Canadian mainland by the [[Confederation Bridge]] which opened in 1997.\n\n===Newfoundland===\nVarious proposals have been considered for a [[Newfoundland-Labrador fixed link|fixed link]] consisting of bridges, tunnels, and/or causeways across the Strait of Belle Isle, connecting the province of Newfoundland and Labrador's mainland Labrador region with the island of Newfoundland. This strait has a minimum width of 17.4&nbsp;km (10.8&nbsp;mi).\n\n===Long Island===\nNine bridges and 13 tunnels (including railroad tunnels) connect the [[New York City]] boroughs of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]], on [[Long Island]], to [[Manhattan]] and [[Staten Island]] and, via these, to [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] in [[New Jersey]] and [[The Bronx]] on the mainland of [[New York (state)|New York]] state. However, no fixed crossing of the [[Long Island Sound]] exists east of New York City; most traffic from the mainland United States must pass through the city to access Long Island. Passenger and auto ferries connect [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] on Long Island northward across the Sound to the mainland of [[New York (state)|New York]] state and westward to the state of [[Connecticut]]. There have been various proposals, none successful, to replace these ferries with a [[Long Island Sound link|fixed link across Long Island Sound]] to provide an alternate route around New York City for Long Island-bound traffic.\n\n===Delmarva===\nThe [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel]] (CBBT) is a 23-mile-long (37&nbsp;km) fixed link crossing the mouth of the United States' Chesapeake Bay, connecting the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] with [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. It opened in 1964.\n\n===Florida to Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico===\nFerry services between the US and Cuba and between Cuba and Haiti have been suspended due to the ongoing [[United States embargo against Cuba]].\n\nThere's only one regular ferry to Havana from a foreign port: [[Canc\u00fan]], [[Mexico]].<ref>[http://www.travelcubacaribbean.com/cruise/cruise.asp]</ref>\n\nThere is a ferry that travels between [[Mayag\u00fcez]] in [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Santo Domingo]] in the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref>[http://www.ferriesdelcaribe.com/ingles/]</ref>\n\n===Dari\u00e9n Gap===\n{{Main|Dari\u00e9n Gap}}\nA notable break in the [[Pan-American Highway]] is a section of land located in the [[Dari\u00e9n Province]] in Panama and the [[Colombia]]n border called the [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]]. It is an {{convert|87|km|mi|adj=on}} stretch of rainforest. The gap has been crossed by adventurers on bicycle, motorcycle, [[all-terrain vehicle]], and foot, dealing with jungle, swamp, insects, kidnapping and other hazards.\n\nSome people, groups, indigenous populations, and governments are opposed to completing the Dari\u00e9n portion of the highway. Reasons for opposition include protecting the rain forest, containing the spread of tropical diseases, protecting the livelihood of indigenous peoples in the area, and reducing the spread of drug trafficking and its associated violence from Colombia.\n\n==Transatlantic tunnel==\n{{Main|Transatlantic tunnel}}\nA '''transatlantic tunnel''' is a theoretical [[tunnel]] that would span the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] possibly for such purposes as [[mass transit]].

The authors go on to write that Harriman traveled to Japan a few years later to continue this proposal.\n* \"The Bering Strait Crossing: A 21st Century Frontier Between East and West\" by James Oliver published in 2006 (256 pages) mentions extensively the Intercontinental Highway.  He goes on to mention that the notion of a global highway has been around for hundreds of years including William Gilpen, who suggests it in 1846 was a proponent of a global rail highway to link to the then being proposed European and Asiatic Railway.\n* \"Planning and Design of Bridges\" by M. S. Troitsky, 1994 describes many of the bridges and tunnels proposed in the Trans Global Highway article including on page 39 this book mentions that in 1958, T.Y. Lin mentions the possible construction of a Bering Strait bridge (and obviously a needed highway network).\n* Alaska History: A Publication of the Alaska Historical Society, Volumes 4-6 (1989)  mentions on page 6 that in 1892, a man named Strauss proposed a global highway and a man made bridge over the Bering Strait.  The article goes on to mention the Lin proposal of 1958.\n* \"Maritime Information Review\"  a publication of the Netherlands Maritime Information Centre,  in 1991 had an extensive article, on \"strait crossings\" covering the then proposed Bering Strait bridge, the Gibraltar Tunnel and so on, and mentions the proposed global highway network.\n* Popular Mechanics Apr 1994 has an article \"Alaska Siberia Bridge\" and the article goes on to mention the construction of a global highway.\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120424004355/http://transglobalhighway.com/   Didik's original Trans-Global Highway proposal]\n* [http://www.didik.com/highway/tgwmap2.jpg Map of its route]\n* [http://www.schillerinstitute.org/economy/maps/maps3.html#bering%20straits   The Schiller Institute article on the Trans Global Highway]\n* [http://wikivoyage.org/ Wikivoyage], Wikimedia's global travel guide with information on driving in each country\n\n[[Category:Exploratory engineering]]\n[[Category:Transportation planning]]\n[[Category:Proposed undersea tunnels]]\n[[Category:Proposed bridges]]\n", "name_user": "Aldrin Orlanes Politico", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_and_transoceanic_fixed_links"}
