In 1951, the first Penryhn Road campus buildings opened. Kingston was recognised as a 'Regional College of Technology' by the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]] in 1957. In 1970, the College of Technology merged with the College of Art to become Kingston Polytechnic, offering 34 major courses, of which 17 were at degree level.<ref name=kuwebsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingston.ac.uk/aboutkingstonuniversity/factsandfigures/ourhistory/|title=Our history - Facts and figures|website=Kingston University Website|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref> In 1975, Kingston merged with the Gipsy Hill College of Education, incorporating the College's faculty into Kingston's Division of Educational Studies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.kingston.ac.uk/documents/aboutkingstonuniversity/factsandfigures/ourhistory/documents/history-of-kingston-text.pdf|title=A History of Kingston university|last=Gibson|first=Michael|date=1999|publisher=Kingston University|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nKingston was granted university status under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].

The advent of totalitarianism marked the beginning of a new political era in the 20th century. This form of government is characterized by the presence of a single political party and more specifically, by a powerful leader (a real [[role model]]) who imposes his personal and political prominence. The two fundamental aspects that contribute to the maintenance of the power are: a steadfast collaboration between the government and the police force, and a highly developed ideology. Here, the government has \"total control of mass communications and social and economic organizations\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=Neil|date=2010|title=Review: Totalitarianism, Social Science, and the Margins.|jstor=canajsocicahican.35.3.463|journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology|volume= 35| issue =  3|pages= 463\u201369|doi=10.29173/cjs8876|doi-access=free}}</ref> According to [[Hannah Arendt]], totalitarianism is a new and extreme form of dictatorship composed of \"atomized, isolated individuals\".<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=661026|title=Dictators and dictatorships: understanding authoritarian regimes and their leaders|last=Ezrow|first=Natasha M|last2=Frantz|first2=Erica|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-4411-1602-4|location=New York|pages=|language=English}}</ref> In addition, she affirmed that ideology plays a leading role in defining how the entire society should be organized.

In [[Barbara Geddes (academic)|Barbara Geddes]]'s study, she focused in how elite-leader and elite-mass relations influence [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] politics. Geddes typology identifies the key institutions that structure elite politics in dictatorships (i.e. parties and militaries). The study is based on, and directly related to, factors like: the simplicity of the categorizations, cross-national applicability, the emphasis on elites and leaders, and the incorporation of institutions (parties and militaries) as central to shaping politics. According to Barbara Geddes, a dictatorial government may be classified in five typologies: Military Dictatorships, Single-party Dictatorships, Personalist Dictatorships, [[Monarchy|Monarchies]], Hybrid Dictatorships.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Military dictatorships ===\n{{main|Military dictatorship}}\nMilitary dictatorships are regimes in which a group of officers holds power, determines who will lead the country, and exercises influence over policy. High-level [[elite]]s and a [[Leadership|leader]] are the members of the military dictatorship. Military dictatorships are characterized by rule by a professionalized military as an institution. In military regimes, elites are referred to as junta members; they are typically senior officers (and often other high-level officers) in the military.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Friedrich|first=Carl|date=1950|title=Military Government and Dictatorship.|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume= 267|pages= 1\u20137|oclc=5723774494|doi=10.1177/000271625026700102}}</ref>\n\n=== Single-party dictatorships ===\n{{Main|One-party state}}\nSingle-party dictatorships are regimes in which one party dominates politics. In single-party dictatorships, a single party has access to political posts and control over policy. In single-party dictatorships, party elites are typically members of the ruling body of the party, sometimes called the [[central committee]], [[politburo]], or [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]]. These groups of individuals controls the selection of party officials and \"organizes the distribution of benefits to supporters and mobilizes citizens to vote and show support for party leaders\".<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n=== Personalist dictatorships ===\nPersonalist dictatorships are regimes in which all power lies in the hands of a single individual. Personalist dictatorships differ from other forms of dictatorships in their access to key political positions, other fruits of office, and depend much more on the discretion of the personalist dictator. Personalist dictators may be members of the military or leaders of a political party. Yet, neither the military nor the party exercises power independent from the dictator. In personalist dictatorships, the elite corps is usually made up of close friends or family members of the dictator. These individuals are all typically handpicked to serve their posts by the dictator.<ref name=\":02\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Peceny|first=Mark|date=2003|title=Peaceful Parties and Puzzling Personalists.|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume= 97| issue =  2|pages= 339\u201342|oclc=208155326|doi=10.1017/s0003055403000716}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, personalist dictatorships are more repressive than other forms of dictatorship.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frantz|first=Erica|last2=Kendall-Taylor|first2=Andrea|last3=Wright|first3=Joseph|last4=Xu|first4=Xu|date=2019-08-27|title=Personalization of Power and Repression in Dictatorships|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/706049|journal=The Journal of Politics|pages=000\u2013000|doi=10.1086/706049|issn=0022-3816}}</ref>\n\n=== Monarchic dictatorships ===\n{{main|Absolute monarchy}}\n[[File:Salman of Saudi Arabia (2017-10-05) 2.jpg|thumb|King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]]<ref>\"[http://www.dawn.com/news/1159990 Call them \u2018Dictators\u2019, not \u2018Kings\u2019]\".

Roman dictators were allocated absolute power during times of emergency. In execution, their power was originally neither arbitrary nor unaccountable, being subject to law and requiring retrospective justification. There were no such dictatorships after the beginning of the 2nd century BC and later dictators such as [[Sulla]] and the [[Roman Emperor]]s exercised power much more personally and arbitrarily. As the Roman Emperor was a [[king]] in all but name, a concept that remained anathema to traditional Roman society, the institution was not carried forward into the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n=== 19th-century Latin American caudillos ===\n{{main|Caudillo}}\n[[File:Santaanna1.JPG|170px|thumb|right|[[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] wearing [[Mexico|Mexican]] military uniform]]\nAfter the collapse of Spanish colonial rule, various dictators came to power in many liberated countries. Often leading a private army, these ''[[caudillo]]s'' or self-appointed political-military leaders, attacked weak national [[government]]s once they controlled a region's political and economic powers, with examples such as [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] in Mexico and [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in Argentina. Such dictators have been also referred to as \"[[personalismo]]s\".\n\nThe wave of [[military dictatorship]]s in South America in the second half of the twentieth century left a particular mark on [[Latin American culture]]. In [[Latin American literature]], the [[dictator novel]] challenging dictatorship and ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]'' is a significant genre. There are also many [[films depicting Latin American military dictatorships]].\n\n=== Communism and Fascism in 20th-century dictatorships ===\nIn the first half of the 20th century, [[Communism|Communist]] and [[Fascism|Fascist]] dictatorships appeared in a variety of scientifically and technologically advanced countries, which are distinct from dictatorships in Latin America and post-colonial dictatorships in Africa and Asia. Leading examples of modern totalitarian dictatorship include:\n* [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]], [[Hideki Tojo]]'s [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922-1943)|Italy]], [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], and [[Ion Antonescu]]'s [[Romania]].\n\n* [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Republic of China]], [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]'s North Korea, [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]]'s [[Romania]], the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Cambodia]],  and other Communist dictatorships that appeared after [[World War II]] in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, East Asia, Latin America, Africa and other countries.\n\n===Dictatorships in Africa and Asia after World War II===\n[[File:Prins Bernhard in Zaire (voorheen Belgisch Congo), Bernhard en Mobutu, Bestanddeelnr 926-6037.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], Zaire's longtime dictator]]\nAfter World War II, dictators established themselves in the several new states of Africa and Asia, often at the expense or failure of the constitutions inherited from the colonial powers. These constitutions often failed to work without a strong middle class or work against the preexisting autocratic rule. Some elected presidents and prime ministers captured power by suppressing the opposition and installing one-party rule and others established military dictatorships through their armies.

These bandits provide a disincentive for investment and production. Olson states that a community of individuals would be better served if that bandit were to establish himself as a stationary bandit to monopolize theft in the form of taxes. Except from the community, the bandits themselves will be better served, according to Olson, by transforming themselves into \"stationary bandits\". By settling down and making themselves the rulers of a territory, they will be able to make more profits through taxes than they used to obtain through plunder. By maintaining order and providing protection to the community, the bandits will create a peaceful environment in which their people can maximize their surplus which means a greater taxable base. Thus a potential dictator will have a greater incentive to provide security to a given community from which he is extracting taxes and conversely, the people from whom he extracts the taxes are more likely to produce because they will be unconcerned with potential theft by other bandits. This is the rationality that bandits use in order to justify their transformation from \"roving bandits\" into \"stationary bandits\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Absolute monarchy]]\n* [[Autocracy]]\n* [[Benevolent dictatorship]]\n* [[Military dictatorship#Civil-military dictatorship|Civil-military dictatorship]]\n* [[Constitutional dictatorship]]\n* [[Stalinism]]\n* [[Maoism]]\n* [[Juche]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the proletariat]]\n* [[Elective dictatorship]]\n* [[Family dictatorship]]\n* ''[[How Democracies Die]]''\n* [[Military dictatorship]]\n* [[Generalissimo]]\n* [[List of titles used by dictators]]\n* [[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)|Maximum Leader]]\n* [[Mobutism]]\n* [[Nazism]]\n* [[Fascism]]\n* [[People's democratic dictatorship]]\n* [[Right-wing dictatorship]]\n* [[Selectorate theory]]\n* [[Strongman (politics)|Strongman]]\n* [[Supreme leader]]\n* [[Theocracy]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://docupedia.de/zg/Behrends_dictatorship_v2_en_2017 Behrends, Jan C.

The advent of totalitarianism marked the beginning of a new political era in the 20th century. This form of government is characterized by the presence of a single political party and more specifically, by a powerful leader (a real [[role model]]) who imposes his personal and political prominence. The two fundamental aspects that contribute to the maintenance of the power are: a steadfast collaboration between the government and the police force, and a highly developed ideology. Here, the government has \"total control of mass communications and social and economic organizations\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=Neil|date=2010|title=Review: Totalitarianism, Social Science, and the Margins.|jstor=canajsocicahican.35.3.463|journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology|volume= 35| issue =  3|pages= 463\u201369|doi=10.29173/cjs8876|doi-access=free}}</ref> According to [[Hannah Arendt]], totalitarianism is a new and extreme form of dictatorship composed of \"atomized, isolated individuals\".<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=661026|title=Dictators and dictatorships: understanding authoritarian regimes and their leaders|last=Ezrow|first=Natasha M|last2=Frantz|first2=Erica|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-4411-1602-4|location=New York|pages=|language=English}}</ref> In addition, she affirmed that ideology plays a leading role in defining how the entire society should be organized.

In [[Barbara Geddes (academic)|Barbara Geddes]]'s study, she focused in how elite-leader and elite-mass relations influence [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] politics. Geddes typology identifies the key institutions that structure elite politics in dictatorships (i.e. parties and militaries). The study is based on, and directly related to, factors like: the simplicity of the categorizations, cross-national applicability, the emphasis on elites and leaders, and the incorporation of institutions (parties and militaries) as central to shaping politics. According to Barbara Geddes, a dictatorial government may be classified in five typologies: Military Dictatorships, Single-party Dictatorships, Personalist Dictatorships, [[Monarchy|Monarchies]], Hybrid Dictatorships.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Military dictatorships ===\n{{main|Military dictatorship}}\nMilitary dictatorships are regimes in which a group of officers holds power, determines who will lead the country, and exercises influence over policy. High-level [[elite]]s and a [[Leadership|leader]] are the members of the military dictatorship. Military dictatorships are characterized by rule by a professionalized military as an institution. In military regimes, elites are referred to as junta members; they are typically senior officers (and often other high-level officers) in the military.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Friedrich|first=Carl|date=1950|title=Military Government and Dictatorship.|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume= 267|pages= 1\u20137|oclc=5723774494|doi=10.1177/000271625026700102}}</ref>\n\n=== Single-party dictatorships ===\n{{Main|One-party state}}\nSingle-party dictatorships are regimes in which one party dominates politics. In single-party dictatorships, a single party has access to political posts and control over policy. In single-party dictatorships, party elites are typically members of the ruling body of the party, sometimes called the [[central committee]], [[politburo]], or [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]]. These groups of individuals controls the selection of party officials and \"organizes the distribution of benefits to supporters and mobilizes citizens to vote and show support for party leaders\".<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n=== Personalist dictatorships ===\nPersonalist dictatorships are regimes in which all power lies in the hands of a single individual. Personalist dictatorships differ from other forms of dictatorships in their access to key political positions, other fruits of office, and depend much more on the discretion of the personalist dictator. Personalist dictators may be members of the military or leaders of a political party. Yet, neither the military nor the party exercises power independent from the dictator. In personalist dictatorships, the elite corps is usually made up of close friends or family members of the dictator. These individuals are all typically handpicked to serve their posts by the dictator.<ref name=\":02\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Peceny|first=Mark|date=2003|title=Peaceful Parties and Puzzling Personalists.|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume= 97| issue =  2|pages= 339\u201342|oclc=208155326|doi=10.1017/s0003055403000716}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, personalist dictatorships are more repressive than other forms of dictatorship.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frantz|first=Erica|last2=Kendall-Taylor|first2=Andrea|last3=Wright|first3=Joseph|last4=Xu|first4=Xu|date=2019-08-27|title=Personalization of Power and Repression in Dictatorships|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/706049|journal=The Journal of Politics|pages=000\u2013000|doi=10.1086/706049|issn=0022-3816}}</ref>\n\n=== Monarchic dictatorships ===\n{{main|Absolute monarchy}}\n[[File:Salman of Saudi Arabia (2017-10-05) 2.jpg|thumb|King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]]<ref>\"[http://www.dawn.com/news/1159990 Call them \u2018Dictators\u2019, not \u2018Kings\u2019]\".

Roman dictators were allocated absolute power during times of emergency. In execution, their power was originally neither arbitrary nor unaccountable, being subject to law and requiring retrospective justification. There were no such dictatorships after the beginning of the 2nd century BC and later dictators such as [[Sulla]] and the [[Roman Emperor]]s exercised power much more personally and arbitrarily. As the Roman Emperor was a [[king]] in all but name, a concept that remained anathema to traditional Roman society, the institution was not carried forward into the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n=== 19th-century Latin American caudillos ===\n{{main|Caudillo}}\n[[File:Santaanna1.JPG|170px|thumb|right|[[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] wearing [[Mexico|Mexican]] military uniform]]\nAfter the collapse of Spanish colonial rule, various dictators came to power in many liberated countries. Often leading a private army, these ''[[caudillo]]s'' or self-appointed political-military leaders, attacked weak national [[government]]s once they controlled a region's political and economic powers, with examples such as [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] in Mexico and [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in Argentina. Such dictators have been also referred to as \"[[personalismo]]s\".\n\nThe wave of [[military dictatorship]]s in South America in the second half of the twentieth century left a particular mark on [[Latin American culture]]. In [[Latin American literature]], the [[dictator novel]] challenging dictatorship and ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]'' is a significant genre. There are also many [[films depicting Latin American military dictatorships]].\n\n=== Communism and Fascism in 20th-century dictatorships ===\nIn the first half of the 20th century, [[Communism|Communist]] and [[Fascism|Fascist]] dictatorships appeared in a variety of scientifically and technologically advanced countries, which are distinct from dictatorships in Latin America and post-colonial dictatorships in Africa and Asia. Leading examples of modern totalitarian dictatorship include:\n* [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]], [[Hideki Tojo]]'s [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922-1943)|Italy]], [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], and [[Ion Antonescu]]'s [[Romania]].\n\n* [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Xi Jinping]]'s [[People's Republic of China]], [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]'s North Korea, [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Vietnam]], [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]]'s [[Romania]], the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Cambodia]],  and other Communist dictatorships that appeared after [[World War II]] in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, East Asia, Latin America, Africa and other countries.\n\n===Dictatorships in Africa and Asia after World War II===\n[[File:Prins Bernhard in Zaire (voorheen Belgisch Congo), Bernhard en Mobutu, Bestanddeelnr 926-6037.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], Zaire's longtime dictator]]\nAfter World War II, dictators established themselves in the several new states of Africa and Asia, often at the expense or failure of the constitutions inherited from the colonial powers. These constitutions often failed to work without a strong middle class or work against the preexisting autocratic rule. Some elected presidents and prime ministers captured power by suppressing the opposition and installing one-party rule and others established military dictatorships through their armies.

These bandits provide a disincentive for investment and production. Olson states that a community of individuals would be better served if that bandit were to establish himself as a stationary bandit to monopolize theft in the form of taxes. Except from the community, the bandits themselves will be better served, according to Olson, by transforming themselves into \"stationary bandits\". By settling down and making themselves the rulers of a territory, they will be able to make more profits through taxes than they used to obtain through plunder. By maintaining order and providing protection to the community, the bandits will create a peaceful environment in which their people can maximize their surplus which means a greater taxable base. Thus a potential dictator will have a greater incentive to provide security to a given community from which he is extracting taxes and conversely, the people from whom he extracts the taxes are more likely to produce because they will be unconcerned with potential theft by other bandits. This is the rationality that bandits use in order to justify their transformation from \"roving bandits\" into \"stationary bandits\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Absolute monarchy]]\n* [[Autocracy]]\n* [[Benevolent dictatorship]]\n* [[Military dictatorship#Civil-military dictatorship|Civil-military dictatorship]]\n* [[Constitutional dictatorship]]\n* [[Stalinism]]\n* [[Maoism]]\n* [[Juche]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the proletariat]]\n* [[Elective dictatorship]]\n* [[Family dictatorship]]\n* ''[[How Democracies Die]]''\n* [[Military dictatorship]]\n* [[Generalissimo]]\n* [[List of titles used by dictators]]\n* [[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)|Maximum Leader]]\n* [[Mobutism]]\n* [[Nazism]]\n* [[Fascism]]\n* [[People's democratic dictatorship]]\n* [[Right-wing dictatorship]]\n* [[Selectorate theory]]\n* [[Strongman (politics)|Strongman]]\n* [[Supreme leader]]\n* [[Theocracy]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://docupedia.de/zg/Behrends_dictatorship_v2_en_2017 Behrends, Jan C.

Thr distinction was highly significant in the [[Roman Kingdom]], and the early [[Roman Republic|Republic]], but its relevance waned after the [[Conflict of the Orders]] (494 BC to 287 BC), and by the time of the late Republic and [[Roman Empire|Empire]], membership in the patriciate was of only nominal significance.\n\nThe social structure of Ancient Rome revolved around the distinction between the patricians and the plebeians. The status of patricians gave them more political power than the plebeians. The relationship between the patricians and the plebeians eventually caused the Conflict of the Orders. This time changed the social structure of trash\nAfter the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]] fell, it remained a high [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|honorary title]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Medieval patrician classes]] were once again formally defined groups of leading [[Grand Burgher]] families in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and in many [[Italian city-states|medieval Italian republics]], such as [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], and subsequently \"patrician\" became a vague term used for [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s and the higher [[bourgeoisie]] in many countries. The legacy of the patrician and plebeian distinction lives on in modern society.  This article examines the work of E.P. Thompson to illustrate the legacy that Ancient Rome's class distinction has on modern day class structures.\n\n==Origin==\nAccording to [[Livy]], the first 100 men appointed as senators by [[Romulus]] were referred to as \"fathers\" (Latin ''patres''), and the descendants of those men became the patrician class. This fact is also in an account from [[Cicero]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Botsford|first=George Willis|date=1906|title=The Social Composition of the Primitive Roman Populus|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2140599|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=21|issue=3|pages=498\u2013526|doi=10.2307/2140599|issn=0032-3195}}</ref>  Appointing these one hundred men into the senate gave them a noble status.<ref name=\":1\" /> This noble status is what separated the patricians from the plebeians.

The last known instance of a gens being admitted to the patriciate prior to the 1st century BC was when the [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]] were added to the ranks of the patricians after coming to Rome in 504 BC, five years after the establishment of the Republic.<ref name=\"Harper\">\n[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities|''Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities'']], Second Edition, [[Harry Thurston Peck]], Editor (1897)\n</ref><ref name=\"OCD\" /><ref name=\"livy2\">[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', Book II</ref><ref name=\"livy1\">[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', Book I</ref> This specific reason as to why Romulus chose who he chose remains contested by academics and historians but the importance of the patrician/ plebeian distinction is accounted by all as paramount to Ancient Roman society.

This privilege was important in Ancient Roman history and ended up causing a large divide between the two classes. During the middle and late Republic, as this influence gradually eroded, plebeians were granted equal rights in most areas, and even greater in some. For example, only plebeians could serve as the [[Tribune of the Plebs]]. There were quotas for official offices. One of the two consulships was reserved for plebeians. Although being a patrician remained prestigious, it was of minimal practical importance. With the exception of some religious offices which were devoid of political power, plebeians were able to stand for all of the offices that were open to patricians. Plebeians of the [[Nobiles|senatorial class]] were no less wealthy than patricians at the height of the republic. Originally Patrician, [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] willingly got himself adopted into a Plebeian family in order to be able to become the Tribune of the Plebs.\n\n== Roman Republic and Empire ==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n\n===Status===\nPatricians historically had more privileges and rights than plebeians. This status difference was at the beginning of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], patricians were better represented in the [[Roman assemblies]], only patricians could hold high political offices, such as [[Roman dictator|dictator]], [[Roman consul|consul]], and [[Roman censor|censor]], and all priesthoods (such as [[pontifex maximus]]) were closed to non-patricians. There was a belief that patricians communicated better with the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman gods]], so they alone could perform the sacred rites and take the [[Augury|auspices]]. Additionally, not only were the patricians of higher status in political offices but they also had the best land in Ancient Rome.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Mathisen, Ralph W., 1947- author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1137838429|title=Ancient Roman civilization : history and sources, 753 BCE to 640 CE|isbn=978-0-19-084960-3|oclc=1137838429}}</ref> Having the best land would allow the patrician class to have more opportunities, such as being able to produce better agriculture. This view had political consequences, since in the beginning of the year or before a military campaign, Roman magistrates used to consult the gods. Livy reports that the first admission of plebeians into a priestly college happened in 300 BC with the passage of the [[Lex Ogulnia]], when the college of [[Augurs]] raised their number from four to nine. After that, plebeians were accepted into the other religious colleges, and by the end of the Republic, only priesthoods with limited political importance, such as the [[Salii]], the [[Flamen|Flamines]], and the [[Rex Sacrorum]], were filled exclusively by patricians.\n\nWhile it was not illegal for a plebeian to run for political office, a plebeian would have not have had the backing needed to win a seat.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=Mathisen, Ralph W., 1947- author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1137838429|title=Ancient Roman civilization : history and sources, 753 BCE to 640 CE|isbn=978-0-19-084960-3|oclc=1137838429}}</ref> Since society was organized in this way, the patrician class was essentially in complete control of Ancient Rome's government.<ref name=\":03\" /> In Cassius' accounts of Ancient Rome, he details how important and advantaged the patrician class was over the plebeian class.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/2*.html|title=Cassius Dio \u2014 Fragments of Book\u00a02|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> He indicates the status difference between patricians and plebeians by detailing about the specific shoes the patricians wore.  Cassius states, \"For the shoes worn by the patricians in the city were ornamented with laced straps and the design of the letter, to signify that they were descended from the original hundred men that had been senators.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> It is clear through Cassius' account that these details mattered and represent the differentiation between classes. For more on Ancient Rome's social class distinction visit [[Social class in ancient Rome|Social Class in Ancient Rome.]]\n\nVery few plebeian names appear in lists of [[Roman magistrate]]s during the early Republic. Two laws passed during the fourth century BC began the gradual opening of magistrates to the plebeians: the [[Lex Licinia Sextia]] of 367 BC, which established the right of plebeians to hold the consulship; and the [[Leges Genuciae|Genucian Law]] of 342 BC, which required that at least one of the consuls be a plebeian (although this law was frequently violated for several decades).\n\nMany of the ancient patrician gentes whose members appear in the founding legends of Rome disappeared as Rome acquired its empire, and new plebeian families rose to prominence. A number of patrician families such as the Horatii, Lucretii, Verginii and Menenii rarely appear in positions of importance during the later republic. Many old families had both patrician and plebeian branches, of which the patrician lines frequently faded into obscurity, and were eclipsed by their plebeian namesakes.\n\nThe decline accelerated toward the end of the Republic, principally because of the civil wars, from the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]] to the proscriptions of the [[Triumviri rei publicae constituendae|Triumvirs]], which took a heavy toll on them. As a result, several illustrious patrician houses were on the verge of extinction during the 1st century BC, sometimes only surviving through adoptions, such as:\n\n* [[Claudius Caesar|Julii Caesares]]\n* [[Manlia (gens)#Manlii Torquati|Manlii Torquatii]]\n* [[Papiria (gens)#Papirii Masones|Papirii Masones]]\n* [[Postumia (gens)#Postumii Albi et Albini|Postumii Albini]]\n* [[Servilii Caepiones]]\n\nHowever, large gentes with multiple {{lang|la|stirpes}} seem to have coped better; the [[Aemilia (gens)|Aemilii]], [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]], [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelii]], [[Fabia (gens)|Fabii]], [[Sulpicia (gens)|Sulpicii]], and [[Valeria (gens)|Valerii]] all continued to thrive under the [[Principate]].\n\n=== Patricians vs. plebeians ===\nThe distinction between patricians and [[Plebs|plebeians]] in Ancient Rome was based purely on birth.  Although modern writers often portray patricians as rich and powerful families who managed to secure power over the less-fortunate plebeian families, plebeians and patricians among the senatorial class were equally wealthy.

It has been suggested that the Aemilii, Claudii, Cornelii, Fabii, Manlii, and Valerii were amongst them. The ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' suggests that the gentes maiores consisted of families that settled at Rome in the time of [[Romulus]], or at least before the destruction of [[Alba Longa]]. The noble Alban families that settled in Rome in the time of [[Tullus Hostilius]] then formed the nucleus of the gentes minores.

This prestige gradually declined further, and by the end of the [[Crisis of the Third Century|3rd-century crisis]] patrician status, as it had been known in the Republic, ceased to have meaning in everyday life. The emperor [[Constantine the Great]] (r. 306\u2013337) reintroduced the term as the empire's senior [[honorific]] title, not tied to any specific administrative position, and from the first limited to a very small number of holders.<ref name=\"ODB\">Kazhdan (1991), p. 1600</ref><ref>Paul Stephenson, ''Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor'', 2010:240.</ref> The historian [[Zosimus]] states that in Constantine's time, the holders of the title ranked even above the [[praetorian prefect]]s.<ref>Zosimus, ''Historia Nova'', II.40.2</ref>\n\nIn the late [[Western Roman Empire]], the title was sparingly used and retained its high prestige, being awarded, especially in the 5th century, to the powerful {{lang|la|[[magister militum|magistri militum]]}} who dominated the state, such as [[Stilicho]], [[Constantius III]], [[Flavius Aetius]], Comes [[Bonifacius]], and [[Ricimer]].<ref name=\"ODB\"/> The eastern emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] (r. 474\u2013491) granted it to [[Odoacer]] to legitimize the latter's rule in Italy after his overthrow of the rebellious {{lang|la|magister militum}} [[Orestes (father of Romulus Augustulus)|Orestes]] and his son [[Romulus Augustulus]] in 476. In the Eastern Empire, [[Theodosius II]] (r. 408\u2013450) barred [[eunuch]]s from holding it, although this restriction had been overturned by the 6th century. Under [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565), the title proliferated and was consequently somewhat devalued, as the emperor opened it up to all those above {{lang|la|[[vir illustris|illustris]]}} rank, i.e. the majority of the [[Byzantine Senate|Senate]].<ref>Bury (1911), p. 27</ref>\n\nIn the 8th century, the title was further lowered in the court order of precedence, coming after the {{lang|grc-Latn|[[magistros]]}} and the {{lang|grc-Latn|[[anthypatos]]}}.

Romulus is credited with creating the Patrician class.]]\nThe '''patricians''' (from {{lang-la|[[Wikt:patricius|patricius]]}}) were originally a group of [[ruling class]] families in [[ancient Rome]]. The distinction was highly significant in the [[Roman Kingdom]], and the early [[Roman Republic|Republic]], but its relevance waned after the [[Conflict of the Orders]] (494 BC to 287 BC), and by the time of the late Republic and [[Roman Empire|Empire]], membership in the patriciate was of only nominal significance.\n\nThe social structure of Ancient Rome revolved around the distinction between the patricians and the plebeians. The status of patricians gave them more political power than the plebeians. The relationship between the patricians and the plebeians eventually caused the Conflict of the Orders. This time changed the social structure of Ancient Rome.\n\nAfter the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]] fell, it remained a high [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|honorary title]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Medieval patrician classes]] were once again formally defined groups of leading [[Grand Burgher]] families in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and in many [[Italian city-states|medieval Italian republics]], such as [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], and subsequently \"patrician\" became a vague term used for [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s and the higher [[bourgeoisie]] in many countries. The legacy of the patrician and plebeian distinction lives on in modern society.  This article examines the work of E.P. Thompson to illustrate the legacy that Ancient Rome's class distinction has on modern day class structures.\n\n==Origin==\nAccording to [[Livy]], the first 100 men appointed as senators by [[Romulus]] were referred to as \"fathers\" (Latin ''patres''), and the descendants of those men became the patrician class.

This privilege was important in Ancient Roman history and ended up causing a large divide between the two classes. During the middle and late Republic, as this influence gradually eroded, plebeians were granted equal rights in most areas, and even greater in some. For example, only plebeians could serve as the [[Tribune of the Plebs]]. There were quotas for official offices. One of the two consulships was reserved for plebeians. Although being a patrician remained prestigious, it was of minimal practical importance. With the exception of some religious offices which were devoid of political power, plebeians were able to stand for all of the offices that were open to patricians. Plebeians of the [[Nobiles|senatorial class]] were no less wealthy than patricians at the height of the republic. Originally Patrician, [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] willingly got himself adopted into a Plebeian family in order to be able to become the Tribune of the Plebs.\n\n== Roman Republic and Empire ==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n\n===Status===\nPatricians historically had more privileges and rights than plebeians. This status difference was at the beginning of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], patricians were better represented in the [[Roman assemblies]], only patricians could hold high political offices, such as [[Roman dictator|dictator]], [[Roman consul|consul]], and [[Roman censor|censor]], and all priesthoods (such as [[pontifex maximus]]) were closed to non-patricians. There was a belief that patricians communicated better with the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman gods]], so they alone could perform the sacred rites and take the [[Augury|auspices]]. Additionally, not only were the patricians of higher status in political offices but they also had the best land in Ancient Rome.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Mathisen, Ralph W., 1947- author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1137838429|title=Ancient Roman civilization : history and sources, 753 BCE to 640 CE|isbn=978-0-19-084960-3|oclc=1137838429}}</ref> Having the best land would allow the patrician class to have more opportunities, such as being able to produce better agriculture. This view had political consequences, since in the beginning of the year or before a military campaign, Roman magistrates used to consult the gods. Livy reports that the first admission of plebeians into a priestly college happened in 300 BC with the passage of the [[Lex Ogulnia]], when the college of [[Augurs]] raised their number from four to nine. After that, plebeians were accepted into the other religious colleges, and by the end of the Republic, only priesthoods with limited political importance, such as the [[Salii]], the [[Flamen|Flamines]], and the [[Rex Sacrorum]], were filled exclusively by patricians.\n\nWhile it was not illegal for a plebeian to run for political office, a plebeian would have not have had the backing needed to win a seat.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=Mathisen, Ralph W., 1947- author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1137838429|title=Ancient Roman civilization : history and sources, 753 BCE to 640 CE|isbn=978-0-19-084960-3|oclc=1137838429}}</ref> Since society was organized in this way, the patrician class was essentially in complete control of Ancient Rome's government.<ref name=\":03\" /> In Cassius' accounts of Ancient Rome, he details how important and advantaged the patrician class was over the plebeian class.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/2*.html|title=Cassius Dio \u2014 Fragments of Book\u00a02|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> He indicates the status difference between patricians and plebeians by detailing about the specific shoes the patricians wore.

Two laws passed during the fourth century BC began the gradual opening of magistrates to the plebeians: the [[Lex Licinia Sextia]] of 367 BC, which established the right of plebeians to hold the consulship; and the [[Leges Genuciae|Genucian Law]] of 342 BC, which required that at least one of the consuls be a plebeian (although this law was frequently violated for several decades).\n\nMany of the ancient patrician gentes whose members appear in the founding legends of Rome disappeared as Rome acquired its empire, and new plebeian families rose to prominence. A number of patrician families such as the Horatii, Lucretii, Verginii and Menenii rarely appear in positions of importance during the later republic. Many old families had both patrician and plebeian branches, of which the patrician lines frequently faded into obscurity, and were eclipsed by their plebeian namesakes.\n\nThe decline accelerated toward the end of the Republic, principally because of the civil wars, from the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]] to the proscriptions of the [[Triumviri rei publicae constituendae|Triumvirs]], which took a heavy toll on them. As a result, several illustrious patrician houses were on the verge of extinction during the 1st century BC, sometimes only surviving through adoptions, such as:\n\n* [[Claudius Caesar|Julii Caesares]]\n* [[Manlia (gens)#Manlii Torquati|Manlii Torquatii]]\n* [[Papiria (gens)#Papirii Masones|Papirii Masones]]\n* [[Postumia (gens)#Postumii Albi et Albini|Postumii Albini]]\n* [[Servilii Caepiones]]\n\nHowever, large gentes with multiple {{lang|la|stirpes}} seem to have coped better; the [[Aemilia (gens)|Aemilii]], [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]], [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelii]], [[Fabia (gens)|Fabii]], [[Sulpicia (gens)|Sulpicii]], and [[Valeria (gens)|Valerii]] all continued to thrive under the [[Principate]].\n\n=== Patricians vs. plebeians ===\nThe distinction between patricians and [[Plebs|plebeians]] in Ancient Rome was based purely on birth.  Although modern writers often portray patricians as rich and powerful families who managed to secure power over the less-fortunate plebeian families, plebeians and patricians among the senatorial class were equally wealthy. As civil rights for plebeians increased during the middle and late [[Roman Republic]], many plebeian families had attained wealth and power while some traditionally patrician families had fallen into poverty and obscurity. However, no amount of wealth could change one's class.<ref name=\":04\">{{Cite book|last=Mathisen, Ralph W., 1947- author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1137838429|title=Ancient Roman civilization : history and sources, 753 BCE to 640 CE|isbn=978-0-19-084960-3|oclc=1137838429}}</ref>\n\n=== The Conflict of The Orders ===\nEventually, the plebeians became unsatisfied with being the lower class and not having the same rights and privileges as the patricians.<ref name=\":05\">{{Cite book|last=Mathisen, Ralph W., 1947- author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1137838429|title=Ancient Roman civilization : history and sources, 753 BCE to 640 CE|isbn=978-0-19-084960-3|oclc=1137838429}}</ref> This time in Roman history is called the [[Conflict of the Orders]], which took place between 500-287 BCE.<ref name=\":05\" /> Due to the patricians having the political status, the plebeian class had no representation in the government to advocate for their interests.<ref name=\":05\" /> By not having anyone advocating for their interests, this also meant that the Plebeians did not know the laws they had to abide by.<ref name=\":05\" /> Since the patricians were of high social status, they did not want to lose this status; they were not in agreement with changing the structure of society by giving plebeians more status.<ref name=\":05\" /> Eventually, the plebeian class came together and created their own governing body, the Council of the Plebs.<ref name=\":05\" /> Another advancement that came from the Conflict of the Orders was the twelve tables.  At this time in Ancient Rome, the monarchy had been over thrown.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Michael|date=1982|title=The Twelve Tables and Their Origins: An Eighteenth-Century Debate|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2709429|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=43|issue=3|pages=379\u2013396|doi=10.2307/2709429|issn=0022-5037}}</ref> The plebeians wanted to know the laws, which resulted in the written form of laws: the [[Twelve Tables]].<ref name=\":05\" /> Even once these laws were written down, and the new Centuriate Assembly was created, the patrician class remained in power. The assembly separated citizens into classes, however, the top two class, Equestrians and Class 1, were able to control the majority of the vote.<ref name=\":05\" /> This meant, that while the plebeians were able to vote, if the patrician classes voted together, the could control the vote.<ref name=\":05\" /> Ancient Rome, according to Ralph Mathisen, author of ''Ancient Roman Civilization: History and Sources,'' made political reforms, such as the introduction of the Council of the Plebs and the Tribunes of the Plebs.  These two political bodies were created to give the plebeians a voice. After the Conflict of the Orders, according to Mathisen, Plebeians were able to rise in politics and become members of the Senate, which used to be exclusively for patricians.<ref name=\":05\" />\n\n=== Marriage ===\nA marriage between a patrician and a plebeian was the only way to legally integrate the two classes. However, once the Twelve Tables were written down, a law was written which made the marriage between the two classes illegal.<ref name=\":06\">{{Cite book|last=Mathisen, Ralph W., 1947- author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1137838429|title=Ancient Roman civilization : history and sources, 753 BCE to 640 CE|isbn=978-0-19-084960-3|oclc=1137838429}}</ref> If a marriage was to occur between a patrician and a plebeian, the children of that marriage would then be given patrician status. This law was created to prevent the classes from mixing. In Ancient Rome women did not have power in the household.  However, according to Mathisen, having a recognized marriage, so not illegally marrying into the other class, was important.<ref name=\":06\" /> Having a legally recognized marriage ensured that the children born from the marriage were given Roman citizenship and any property they might inherit.<ref name=\":06\" />\n\n=== Modern Day ===\nWhen the patrician class was created, the term \"patres\" was used to describe the head of the household, also known as the patres familias.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|last=Botsford|first=George Willis|date=1906|title=The Social Composition of the Primitive Roman Populus|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2140599|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=21|issue=3|pages=498\u2013526|doi=10.2307/2140599|issn=0032-3195}}</ref> This term evolved into the word patriarch.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E.

Thompson argues that there is a reason why rulers have looked back on history, specifically at Ancient Rome, to identify this form of societal order.<ref name=\":3\" /> Using the term \"patres\" in today's society, as detailed by Thompson, means \"from above\".<ref name=\":3\" />  One can deduct from this understanding of the term to indicate that the patres was the highest role one could have in the family.  The relationship of \"from above\" governing transitions from families in Ancient Rome, to government's of current societies.  The influence that the patrician class has on current day society and social class distinction visible through Thompson's reading.

The other patrician families were called the {{lang|la|gentes minores}}. Whether this distinction had any legal significance is not known, but it has been suggested that the {{lang|la|princeps senatus}}, or Speaker of the Senate, was traditionally chosen from the {{lang|la|gentes maiores}}.\n\nNo list of the gentes maiores has been discovered, and even their number is entirely unknown. It has been suggested that the Aemilii, Claudii, Cornelii, Fabii, Manlii, and Valerii were amongst them. The ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' suggests that the gentes maiores consisted of families that settled at Rome in the time of [[Romulus]], or at least before the destruction of [[Alba Longa]]. The noble Alban families that settled in Rome in the time of [[Tullus Hostilius]] then formed the nucleus of the gentes minores. These included the Julii, Tulii, Servilii, Quinctii, Geganii, Curtii, and Cloelii.<ref name=\"OCD\">''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 2nd ed. (1970).</ref><ref>Greenidge, Abel Hendy Jones, ''Roman Public Life'' (London: MacMillan, 1901), page 12.</ref>\n\nHowever, ''[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities]]'' suggests that the Alban families were also included among the gentes maiores, and that the gentes minores consisted of the families admitted to the patriciate under the [[King of Rome|Tarquins]] and in the early years of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]]. In any case, the distinction cannot have been based entirely on priority, because the Claudii did not arrive at Rome until after the expulsion of the kings.<ref name=\"OCD\"/><ref>''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], Editor.</ref><ref>[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', i. 30, ii. 16.</ref><ref>''[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities|Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities]]'', Second Edition, [[Harry Thurston Peck]], Editor (1897)</ref>\n\n==Late Roman and Byzantine periods==\nPatrician status still carried a degree of prestige at the time of the early [[Roman Empire]], and Roman emperors routinely elevated their supporters to the patrician caste ''en masse''. This prestige gradually declined further, and by the end of the [[Crisis of the Third Century|3rd-century crisis]] patrician status, as it had been known in the Republic, ceased to have meaning in everyday life. The emperor [[Constantine the Great]] (r. 306\u2013337) reintroduced the term as the empire's senior [[honorific]] title, not tied to any specific administrative position, and from the first limited to a very small number of holders.<ref name=\"ODB\">Kazhdan (1991), p. 1600</ref><ref>Paul Stephenson, ''Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor'', 2010:240.</ref> The historian [[Zosimus]] states that in Constantine's time, the holders of the title ranked even above the [[praetorian prefect]]s.<ref>Zosimus, ''Historia Nova'', II.40.2</ref>\n\nIn the late [[Western Roman Empire]], the title was sparingly used and retained its high prestige, being awarded, especially in the 5th century, to the powerful {{lang|la|[[magister militum|magistri militum]]}} who dominated the state, such as [[Stilicho]], [[Constantius III]], [[Flavius Aetius]], Comes [[Bonifacius]], and [[Ricimer]].<ref name=\"ODB\"/> The eastern emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] (r. 474\u2013491) granted it to [[Odoacer]] to legitimize the latter's rule in Italy after his overthrow of the rebellious {{lang|la|magister militum}} [[Orestes (father of Romulus Augustulus)|Orestes]] and his son [[Romulus Augustulus]] in 476. In the Eastern Empire, [[Theodosius II]] (r. 408\u2013450) barred [[eunuch]]s from holding it, although this restriction had been overturned by the 6th century. Under [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565), the title proliferated and was consequently somewhat devalued, as the emperor opened it up to all those above {{lang|la|[[vir illustris|illustris]]}} rank, i.e. the majority of the [[Byzantine Senate|Senate]].<ref>Bury (1911), p. 27</ref>\n\nIn the 8th century, the title was further lowered in the court order of precedence, coming after the {{lang|grc-Latn|[[magistros]]}} and the {{lang|grc-Latn|[[anthypatos]]}}. However it remained one of the highest in the imperial hierarchy until the 11th century, being awarded to the most important {{lang|grc-Latn|[[strategos|strategoi]]}} (provincial governors and generals) of the Empire.<ref name=\"ODB\"/> In the court hierarchy, the eunuch {{lang|grc-Latn|patrikioi}} enjoyed higher precedence, coming before even the {{lang|grc|anthypatoi-Latn}}.<ref>Bury (1911), p. 124</ref> According to the late 9th-century {{lang|grc-Latn|[[Kletorologion]]}}, the insignia of the dignity were [[ivory]] inscribed tablets.<ref>Bury (1911), p. 22</ref> During the 11th century, the dignity of {{lang|grc|patrikios}} followed the fate of other titles: extensively awarded, it lost in status, and disappeared during the [[Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty|Komnenian period]] in the early 12th century.<ref name=\"ODB\"/> The title of {{lang|grc-Latn|'''pr\u014dtopatrikios'''}} ({{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"first patrician\") is also evidenced in the East from 367 to 711, possibly referring to the senior-most holder of the office and leader of the patrician order ({{lang|grc-Latn|taxis}}).<ref name=\"ODB\"/><ref>Bury (1911), p. 28</ref> The feminine variant {{lang|grc-Latn|'''patrikia'''}} ({{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03b1}}) denoted the spouses of {{lang|grc-Latn|patrikioi}}; it is not to be confused with the title of {{lang|grc-Latn|[[zoste patrikia|zost\u0113 patrikia]]}} (\"girded {{lang|grc-Latn|patrikia}}\"), which was a unique dignity conferred on the ladies-in-waiting of the empress.<ref name=\"ODB\"/>\n\nThe patrician title was occasionally used in Western Europe after the end of the Roman Empire; for instance, [[Pope Stephen II]] granted the title \"Patricius of the Romans\" to the Frankish ruler [[Pepin the Short]].<ref name=\"ODB\"/> The revival of patrician classes in medieval [[Italian city-states]], and also north of the Alps, is covered in [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricianship]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Nobility]]\n*[[Aristocracy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book |title=The Imperial Administrative System of the Ninth Century |last=Bury |first=John B. |authorlink=J.
