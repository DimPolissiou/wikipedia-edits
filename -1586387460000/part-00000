Introduced in 1983,<ref>[http://processortimeline.info/proc1980.htm Chronology of Microprocessors (1980-1989)]</ref> the W65C816S is an enhanced version of the WDC [[65C02]] [[8-bit]] MPU, itself a [[CMOS]] enhancement of the venerable [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] MPU. The 65C816 was the CPU for the [[Apple IIGS]] and in modified form, [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].\n\nThe ''65'' in the part's designation comes from its 65C02 compatibility mode, and the ''816'' signifies that the MPU has selectable 8&ndash; and 16&ndash;bit [[processor register|register]] sizes. In addition to the availability of 16 bit registers, the W65C816S features extended [[memory address]]ing to [[24-bit]]s, supporting up to 16 [[megabyte]]s of [[random-access memory]], an enhanced instruction set, and a 16 bit [[Stack (data structure)|stack pointer]], as well as several new electrical signals for improved system hardware management.\n\nAt [[reset (computing)|reset]], the W65C816S starts in \"emulation mode,\" meaning it substantially behaves as a 65C02. Thereafter, the W65C816S may be switched to \"native mode\" with a two instruction sequence, causing it to enable all enhanced features, yet still maintain a substantial degree of [[backward compatibility]] with most 65C02 software. However, unlike the [[PDIP|PDIP40]] version of the 65C02, which is a [[pin-compatible]] replacement for its NMOS ancestor, the PDIP40 W65C816S is not pin-compatible with any other 6502 family MPU.\n\nRelated to the W65C816S is the '''W65C802''', which had the same internal structure and 16-bit support, but used a 40-pin layout compatible with the original 6502. This allowed it to be used as a drop-in replacement in certain roles.  However, the 65C802 could not emit a full 24-bit address, which limited it to 64&nbsp;kB of memory. The 65C802 is no longer produced.\n\n==History==\n[[File:65c816plcc.jpg|thumb|[[plastic leaded chip carrier|PLCC-44]] version of '''W65C816S''' microprocessor, shown mounted on a [[single-board computer]].]]\nIn 1981, [[Bill Mensch]], founder and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of WDC, began development of the 65C02 with his production partners, primarily [[Rockwell Semiconductor]] and [[Synertek]]. The primary goal of the 65C02 effort was to move from the original 6502's NMOS process to the 65C02's CMOS, which would allow it to run at much lower power levels, somewhere between {{frac|10}} and {{frac|20}} when running at the same clock speeds. A number of new [[opcode]]s and bug fixes were also worked into the design.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=42}}\n\nDevelopment of the W65C816S commenced in 1982 after Mensch consulted with [[Apple Computer]] on a new version of the [[Apple II]] series of [[personal computer]]s that would, among other things, have improved graphics and sound. Apple wanted an MPU that would be software compatible with the 6502 then in use in the Apple II but with the ability to address more memory, and to load and store 16 bit words. The result was the 65C816, finished in March 1984, with samples provided to both Apple and [[Atari]] in the second half of the year and full release in 1985.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=44}} Mensch was aided during the design process by his sister Kathryn, who was responsible for part of the device's layout.\n\nThe same process also led to the 65C802, which was identical inside to the 65C816. Both were produced on the same fabrication lines and diverged only during the last metalization stages when the chip was being connected to the external pins. In the 65C802, those pins had the same layout as the original 6502, which allowed it to be used as a drop-in replacement while still allowing the 16-bit processing of the CPU to be used. However, as it used the original pinout it had only 16 addressing pins, and could therefore only access 64&nbsp;kB of external memory.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=45}} Typically, when hardware manufacturers designed a project from the ground up, they used the 65C816 rather than the 65C802, resulting in the latter being withdrawn from production.\n\nApple subsequently integrated the 65C816 into the [[Apple IIGS]] computer. The basic 65C816 design was [[second source|second-sourced]] by [[Verizon Communications#GTE|GTE]], [[Sanyo]] and others from the mid-to-late 1980s to the early 1990s.\n\nIn the 1990s, both the 65C816 and 65C02 were converted to a fully [[static core]], which made it possible to completely stop the [[clock signal|processor clock]] without losing data in any of the registers. This feature, along with the use of [[static RAM|asynchronous static RAM]], made it possible to produce designs that used minimal power when in a standby state.\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the W65C816S is available from WDC in a 40 pin [[PDIP]] or [[plastic leaded chip carrier|PLCC44]] package, as well as a core for [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] integration (for example [[Winbond]]'s W55V9x series of TV [[Edutainment]] [[integrated circuit|IC]]s). WDC, itself a [[fabless semiconductor company]], works with various [[semiconductor fabrication plant|foundries]] to produce the W65C816S, as well as other compatible products. Discrete processors are available through a number of electronics distributors. For designers who wish to include W65C816S functionality into a custom [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]], WDC offers RTL ([[register-transfer level]]) code in [[Verilog]].\n\n[[File:WDC W65C802P 4 1.jpg|thumb|W65C802P]]\n\n==Features==\nWDC 65816 features:\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |''WDC 65816 registers''\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:10px;

(WDM is the initials of W65C816S designer [[Bill Mensch|William D. Mensch]].)\n\n==Comparison with earlier models==\n===Two modes===\nThe 65C816 has two operating modes, \"emulation mode,\" in which the 16-bit operations are invisible\u2014the index registers are forced to eight bits\u2014 and the chip appears to be very similar to the 65C02, with to the same cycle timings for the opcodes, and \"native mode,\" which exposes all new features. The CPU automatically returns to emulation mode when it is powered on or reset, which allows it to replace a 65C02, assuming one makes the required circuit changes to accommodate the different pin layout.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=42}}\n\n===16-bit registers===\nThe most obvious change to the 65C816 when running in 16-bit mode is the expansion of the various registers from 8-bit to 16-bit values. This affects the accumulator (A), the X and Y [[index register]]s, and the [[stack pointer]] (SP). It does not affect the [[program counter]] (PC), which had always been 16-bit.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=46}}\n\nWhen running in native mode, two bits in the status register change their meaning. In the original 6502, bits 4 and 5 were not used, although bit 4 was sometimes referred to as the B(reak) flag. In native mode, bit 4 becomes the x flag and bit 5 becomes the m flag. These bits control whether or not the [[index register]]s (x) and/or accumulator/memory (m) are 8-bit or 16-bit values. Zeros in these bits indicate 16-bit values, ones indicate 8-bit values. These bits are normally not present when the chip is started up, but are switched on and set to one when switched to native mode.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=46}}\n\nIt might not be immediately obvious why one would want to use the now 16-bit registers in 8-bit mode; however, switching to 8-bit mode using the new <code>SEP</code> (SEt bit in Processor status) and <code>REP</code> (REset) instructions means that all subsequent instructions accessing those registers will only read a single byte instead of two. For instance, if the m bit is set to 1, when an <code>LDA $1234</code> instruction is issued, only a single byte at address $1234 will be read, thereby reducing the number of cycles needed to execute the instruction.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=50}} This is particularly useful when dealing with 8-bit character data, for instance.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=65}}\n\nWhen running in 16-bit mode, operations on the registers affect all 16 bits. A memory access with a register set to 16 bits will access two contiguous bytes of memory, at the cost of one extra clock cycle.  In particular, a read-modify-write instruction, such as <code>ROR <addr></code>, when used while the accumulator is set to 16 bits, will affect two contiguous bytes of memory, not one.  Similarly, all arithmetic and logical operations will be 16-bit operations.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=52}}\n\n===24-bit addressing===\nThe other major change to the system while running in native mode is that the memory model is expanded to a 24-bit format from the original 16-bit format of the 6502. This is handled using two 8-bit offset registers, the Data Bank Register (DB) and the Program Bank Register (PB). Addresses in the code remain in the original 16-bit format, but the values in the DB and PB are prepended to form a 24-bit address in [[main memory]]. This means that instructions can access data within a 64KB ''bank'', and if data outside that bank needs to be accessed, DB has to change or \"long\" addressing must be used (that is, specification of a 24-bit address as an operand to the instruction).\n\nPB determines from which 64KB bank the processor will fetch instructions\u2014there is no programmatic means by which PB can be directly changed.  Branches and 16-bit jumps or 16-bit subroutine calls are generally limited to the bank in PB (<code>JMP(<addr>)</code> always fetches the target address from bank $00).  A 24-bit \"long\" jump or subroutine call is possible, which overcomes the normal 64 KB program size limit.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=46}}\n\nA further addition to the register set is the 16-bit Direct Page Register (DP), which sets the base address for what was formerly called the zero page, but now referred to as direct page. Direct page addressing uses an 8-bit address, which results in faster access than when a 16- or 24-bit address is used.  Also, some addressing modes that offer indirection are only possible on direct page. In the 65(C)02, the direct page is always the first 256 bytes of memory, thus \"zero page.\"  In native mode, the 65C816 can relocate direct (zero) page anywhere in the first 64KB of memory by writing the starting address into DP.  There is a one-cycle access penalty if DP is not set to an even page boundary.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=48}}\n\n===Switching between modes===\nThe current mode of operation is stored in the emulation (E) bit. Having already added the new x and m bits to the previous set of six flags in the status register (SR), there were not enough bits left to hold the new mode bit. Instead, a unique solution was used in which the mode bit was left \"invisible\", unable to be directly accessed. The new <code>XCE</code> (eXchange Carry with Emulation) instruction exchanges the value of the emulation bit with the C(arry) bit, bit 0 in the status register. For instance, if one wants to enter native mode after the processor has started up, one would use <code>CLC</code> to CLear the Carry bit, and then <code>XCE</code> to write it to the emulation bit.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=64}} Returning to 65C02 emulation mode uses <code>SEC</code> followed by <code>XCE</code>.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=65}}\n\nInternally, the 65C816 is a fully 16-bit design.  The m and x bits in SR determine how the user registers (accumulator and index) appear to the rest of the system.  Upon reset, the 65C816 starts in 65C02 emulation mode, in which m and x are set to 1 and cannot be changed.  Hence the registers appear to the rest of the system as 8 bits.  The most significant byte (MSB) of the accumulator (the B-accumulator) is not directly accessible but can be swapped with the least significant byte (LSB) of the accumulator (the A-accumulator) by using the <code>XBA</code> instruction.  There is no corresponding operation for the index registers (.X and .Y).\n\nUpon being switched to native mode, the MSB of .X and .Y will be zero, and the B-accumulator will be unchanged.  If the m bit in SR is cleared, the B-accumulator will \"ganged\" to the A-accumulator to form a 16-bit register.  A load/store or arithmetic/logical operation involving the accumulator and/or memory will be a 16-bit operation\u2014two bus cycles are required to fetch/store a 16-bit value.\n\nIf the x bit in SR is cleared, both index registers will be set to 16-bits.  If used to index an address, e.g., <code>LDA SOMEWHERE,X</code>, the 16-bit value in the index register will be added to the base address to form the effective address.\n\nIf the m bit in SR is set the accumulator will return to being an 8-bit register and subsequent operations on the accumulator, with a few exceptions, will be 8-bit operations.  The B-accumulator will retain the value it had when the accumulator was operating in 16-bit mode.  The exceptions are the instructions that transfer the direct page register (DP) and stack pointer (SP) to/from the accumulator.  These operations are always 16-bits wide in native mode, regardless of the condition of the m bit in the status register.\n\nIf the x bit in SR is set, not only will the index registers return to being 8 bits, whatever was in the MSB while in 16-bit mode will be lost, something an assembly language programmer cannot afford to forget.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=51}}\n\n==Applications==\nSystems based on 65816 variants:\n* [[Acorn Communicator]]\n* [[Apple IIGS]]\n* [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]: the [[video game console|console]]'s [[Ricoh 5A22]] CPU is based on the 65C816\n**Additionally, 30+ Super NES games include the [[Nintendo SA-1|Nintendo SA1]], a 65C816-based co-processor chip, in each cartridge.\n\nIt is also used in the [[C-One]] and [[SuperCPU]] enhancements for the [[Commodore 64]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Interrupts in 65xx processors]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |title=Programming the 65816 - including the 6502, 65C02, 65802 |first1=David |last1=Eyes |first2=Ron |last2=Lichty |publisher=Prentice Hall |date=1986 |isbn=978-0893037895 |url=https://archive.org/details/0893037893ProgrammingThe65816/ |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{See also|MOS Technology 6502#Further reading|l1=List of books about 65xx microprocessor families}}\n* ''[http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/documentation/w65c816s.pdf 65C816 Datasheet]''; Western Design Center; 55 pages; 2018.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/w65c816s-chip.cfm 65C816 webpage] - Western Design Center\n* [http://axis.llx.com/~nparker/a2/opcodes.html 6502/65C02/65C816 Instruction Set decoded]\n* [http://www.zophar.net/tech/65816.html 65816/65C816 Technical Documents] - zophar.net\n* [http://www.defence-force.org/computing/oric/coding/annexe_2/ A 6502 Programmer's Introduction to the 65816] &ndash; A ''Commodore World'' article by Brett Tabke; includes [[Creative Micro Designs|CMD]]'s instruction set summary\n* [http://sbc.bcstechnology.net/65c816interrupts.html Investigating 65C816 Interrupts] &ndash; An extensive discussion of interrupt processing on the 65C816\n<!--- *[http://www.winbond-usa.com/mambo/content/view/286/523/#ProductSelectionGuide Winbond TV Edutainment IC Selection Guide] &ndash; ICs with 65816 CPU core --->\n\n{{FOLDOC}}\n\n{{MOS CPU}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:WDC 65816 65802}}\n[[Category:65xx microprocessors]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1983]]\n[[Category:16-bit microprocessors]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox CPU\n|image          = W65C816S8PG-14 lg.jpg\n|image_size     =\n|caption        = W65C816S in PDIP40 package\n|name           = WDC 65C816\n|produced-start = 1983\n|produced-end   =\n|slowest        = 1  | slow-unit = MHz\n|fastest        = 14  | fast-unit = MHz \n|manuf1         = [[Western Design Center]], others\n|arch           = 6502\n|pack1          = 40-pin [[Dual in-line package|DIP]], others\n}}\n\nThe '''W65C816S''' (also '''65C816''' or '''65816''') is an 8/16-bit [[microprocessor]] (MPU) developed and sold by the [[Western Design Center]] (WDC).

In addition to the availability of 16 bit registers, the W65C816S features extended [[memory address]]ing to [[24-bit]]s, supporting up to 16 [[megabyte]]s of [[random-access memory]], an enhanced instruction set, and a 16 bit [[Stack (data structure)|stack pointer]], as well as several new electrical signals for improved system hardware management.\n\nAt [[reset (computing)|reset]], the W65C816S starts in \"emulation mode,\" meaning it substantially behaves as a 65C02. Thereafter, the W65C816S may be switched to \"native mode\" with a two instruction sequence, causing it to enable all enhanced features, yet still maintain a substantial degree of [[backward compatibility]] with most 65C02 software. However, unlike the [[PDIP|PDIP40]] version of the 65C02, which is a [[pin-compatible]] replacement for its NMOS ancestor, the PDIP40 W65C816S is not pin-compatible with any other 6502 family MPU.\n\nRelated to the W65C816S is the '''W65C802''', which had the same internal structure and 16-bit support, but used a 40-pin layout compatible with the original 6502. This allowed it to be used as a drop-in replacement in certain roles.  However, the 65C802 could not emit a full 24-bit address, which limited it to 64&nbsp;kB of memory. The 65C802 is no longer produced.\n\n==History==\n[[File:65c816plcc.jpg|thumb|[[plastic leaded chip carrier|PLCC-44]] version of '''W65C816S''' microprocessor, shown mounted on a [[single-board computer]].]]\nIn 1981, [[Bill Mensch]], founder and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of WDC, began development of the 65C02 with his production partners, primarily [[Rockwell Semiconductor]] and [[Synertek]]. The primary goal of the 65C02 effort was to move from the original 6502's NMOS process to the 65C02's CMOS, which would allow it to run at much lower power levels, somewhere between {{frac|10}} and {{frac|20}} when running at the same clock speeds. A number of new [[opcode]]s and bug fixes were also worked into the design.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=42}}\n\nDevelopment of the W65C816S commenced in 1982 after Mensch consulted with [[Apple Computer]] on a new version of the [[Apple II]] series of [[personal computer]]s that would, among other things, have improved graphics and sound. Apple wanted an MPU that would be software compatible with the 6502 then in use in the Apple II but with the ability to address more memory, and to load and store 16 bit words. The result was the 65C816, finished in March 1984, with samples provided to both Apple and [[Atari]] in the second half of the year and full release in 1985.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=44}} Mensch was aided during the design process by his sister Kathryn, who was responsible for part of the device's layout.\n\nThe same process also led to the 65C802, which was identical inside to the 65C816. Both were produced on the same fabrication lines and diverged only during the last metalization stages when the chip was being connected to the external pins. In the 65C802, those pins had the same layout as the original 6502, which allowed it to be used as a drop-in replacement while still allowing the 16-bit processing of the CPU to be used. However, as it used the original pinout it had only 16 addressing pins, and could therefore only access 64&nbsp;kB of external memory.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=45}} Typically, when hardware manufacturers designed a project from the ground up, they used the 65C816 rather than the 65C802, resulting in the latter being withdrawn from production.\n\nApple subsequently integrated the 65C816 into the [[Apple IIGS]] computer. The basic 65C816 design was [[second source|second-sourced]] by [[Verizon Communications#GTE|GTE]], [[Sanyo]] and others from the mid-to-late 1980s to the early 1990s.\n\nIn the 1990s, both the 65C816 and 65C02 were converted to a fully [[static core]], which made it possible to completely stop the [[clock signal|processor clock]] without losing data in any of the registers. This feature, along with the use of [[static RAM|asynchronous static RAM]], made it possible to produce designs that used minimal power when in a standby state.\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the W65C816S is available from WDC in a 40 pin [[PDIP]] or [[plastic leaded chip carrier|PLCC44]] package, as well as a core for [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] integration (for example [[Winbond]]'s W55V9x series of TV [[Edutainment]] [[integrated circuit|IC]]s). WDC, itself a [[fabless semiconductor company]], works with various [[semiconductor fabrication plant|foundries]] to produce the W65C816S, as well as other compatible products. Discrete processors are available through a number of electronics distributors. For designers who wish to include W65C816S functionality into a custom [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]], WDC offers RTL ([[register-transfer level]]) code in [[Verilog]].\n\n[[File:WDC W65C802P 4 1.jpg|thumb|W65C802P]]\n\n==Features==\nWDC 65816 features:\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |''WDC 65816 registers''\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:10px;

(WDM is the initials of W65C816S designer [[Bill Mensch|William D. Mensch]].)\n\n==Comparison with earlier models==\n===Two modes===\nThe 65C816 has two operating modes, \"emulation mode,\" in which the 16-bit operations are invisible\u2014the index registers are forced to eight bits\u2014 and the chip appears to be very similar to the 65C02, with to the same cycle timings for the opcodes, and \"native mode,\" which exposes all new features. The CPU automatically returns to emulation mode when it is powered on or reset, which allows it to replace a 65C02, assuming one makes the required circuit changes to accommodate the different pin layout.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=42}}\n\n===16-bit registers===\nThe most obvious change to the 65C816 when running in 16-bit mode is the expansion of the various registers from 8-bit to 16-bit values. This affects the accumulator (A), the X and Y [[index register]]s, and the [[stack pointer]] (SP). It does not affect the [[program counter]] (PC), which had always been 16-bit.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=46}}\n\nWhen running in native mode, two bits in the status register change their meaning. In the original 6502, bits 4 and 5 were not used, although bit 4 was sometimes referred to as the B(reak) flag. In native mode, bit 4 becomes the x flag and bit 5 becomes the m flag. These bits control whether or not the [[index register]]s (x) and/or accumulator/memory (m) are 8-bit or 16-bit values. Zeros in these bits indicate 16-bit values, ones indicate 8-bit values. These bits are normally not present when the chip is started up, but are switched on and set to one when switched to native mode.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=46}}\n\nIt might not be immediately obvious why one would want to use the now 16-bit registers in 8-bit mode; however, switching to 8-bit mode using the new <code>SEP</code> (SEt bit in Processor status) and <code>REP</code> (REset) instructions means that all subsequent instructions accessing those registers will only read a single byte instead of two. For instance, if the m bit is set to 1, when an <code>LDA $1234</code> instruction is issued, only a single byte at address $1234 will be read, thereby reducing the number of cycles needed to execute the instruction.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=50}} This is particularly useful when dealing with 8-bit character data, for instance.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=65}}\n\nWhen running in 16-bit mode, operations on the registers affect all 16 bits. A memory access with a register set to 16 bits will access two contiguous bytes of memory, at the cost of one extra clock cycle.  In particular, a read-modify-write instruction, such as <code>ROR <addr></code>, when used while the accumulator is set to 16 bits, will affect two contiguous bytes of memory, not one.  Similarly, all arithmetic and logical operations will be 16-bit operations.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=52}}\n\n===24-bit addressing===\nThe other major change to the system while running in native mode is that the memory model is expanded to a 24-bit format from the original 16-bit format of the 6502. This is handled using two 8-bit offset registers, the Data Bank Register (DB) and the Program Bank Register (PB). Addresses in the code remain in the original 16-bit format, but the values in the DB and PB are prepended to form a 24-bit address in [[main memory]]. This means that instructions can access data within a 64KB ''bank'', and if data outside that bank needs to be accessed, DB has to change or \"long\" addressing must be used (that is, specification of a 24-bit address as an operand to the instruction).\n\nPB determines from which 64KB bank the processor will fetch instructions\u2014there is no programmatic means by which PB can be directly changed.  Branches and 16-bit jumps or 16-bit subroutine calls are generally limited to the bank in PB (<code>JMP(<addr>)</code> always fetches the target address from bank $00).  A 24-bit \"long\" jump or subroutine call is possible, which overcomes the normal 64 KB program size limit.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=46}}\n\nA further addition to the register set is the 16-bit Direct Page Register (DP), which sets the base address for what was formerly called the zero page, but now referred to as direct page. Direct page addressing uses an 8-bit address, which results in faster access than when a 16- or 24-bit address is used.  Also, some addressing modes that offer indirection are only possible on direct page. In the 65(C)02, the direct page is always the first 256 bytes of memory, thus \"zero page.\"  In native mode, the 65C816 can relocate direct (zero) page anywhere in the first 64KB of memory by writing the starting address into DP.  There is a one-cycle access penalty if DP is not set to an even page boundary.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=48}}\n\n===Switching between modes===\nThe current mode of operation is stored in the emulation (E) bit. Having already added the new x and m bits to the previous set of six flags in the status register (SR), there were not enough bits left to hold the new mode bit. Instead, a unique solution was used in which the mode bit was left \"invisible\", unable to be directly accessed. The new <code>XCE</code> (eXchange Carry with Emulation) instruction exchanges the value of the emulation bit with the C(arry) bit, bit 0 in the status register. For instance, if one wants to enter native mode after the processor has started up, one would use <code>CLC</code> to CLear the Carry bit, and then <code>XCE</code> to write it to the emulation bit.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=64}} Returning to 65C02 emulation mode uses <code>SEC</code> followed by <code>XCE</code>.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=65}}\n\nInternally, the 65C816 is a fully 16-bit design.  The m and x bits in SR determine how the user registers (accumulator and index) appear to the rest of the system.  Upon reset, the 65C816 starts in 65C02 emulation mode, in which m and x are set to 1 and cannot be changed.  Hence the registers appear to the rest of the system as 8 bits.  The most significant byte (MSB) of the accumulator (the B-accumulator) is not directly accessible but can be swapped with the least significant byte (LSB) of the accumulator (the A-accumulator) by using the <code>XBA</code> instruction.  There is no corresponding operation for the index registers (.X and .Y).\n\nUpon being switched to native mode, the MSB of .X and .Y will be zero, and the B-accumulator will be unchanged.  If the m bit in SR is cleared, the B-accumulator will \"ganged\" to the A-accumulator to form a 16-bit register.  A load/store or arithmetic/logical operation involving the accumulator and/or memory will be a 16-bit operation\u2014two bus cycles are required to fetch/store a 16-bit value.\n\nIf the x bit in SR is cleared, both index registers will be set to 16-bits.  If used to index an address, e.g., <code>LDA SOMEWHERE,X</code>, the 16-bit value in the index register will be added to the base address to form the effective address.\n\nIf the m bit in SR is set the accumulator will return to being an 8-bit register and subsequent operations on the accumulator, with a few exceptions, will be 8-bit operations.  The B-accumulator will retain the value it had when the accumulator was operating in 16-bit mode.  The exceptions are the instructions that transfer the direct page register (DP) and stack pointer (SP) to/from the accumulator.  These operations are always 16-bits wide in native mode, regardless of the condition of the m bit in the status register.\n\nIf the x bit in SR is set, not only will the index registers return to being 8 bits, whatever was in the MSB while in 16-bit mode will be lost, something an assembly language programmer cannot afford to forget.{{sfn|Eyes|Lichty|1986|p=51}}\n\n==Applications==\nSystems based on 65816 variants:\n* [[Acorn Communicator]]\n* [[Apple IIGS]]\n* [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]: the [[video game console|console]]'s [[Ricoh 5A22]] CPU is based on the 65C816\n**Additionally, 30+ Super NES games include the [[Nintendo SA-1|Nintendo SA1]], a 65C816-based co-processor chip, in each cartridge.\n\nIt is also used in the [[C-One]] and [[SuperCPU]] enhancements for the [[Commodore 64]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Interrupts in 65xx processors]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |title=Programming the 65816 - including the 6502, 65C02, 65802 |first1=David |last1=Eyes |first2=Ron |last2=Lichty |publisher=Prentice Hall |date=1986 |isbn=978-0893037895 |url=https://archive.org/details/0893037893ProgrammingThe65816/ |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{See also|MOS Technology 6502#Further reading|l1=List of books about 65xx microprocessor families}}\n* ''[http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/documentation/w65c816s.pdf 65C816 Datasheet]''; Western Design Center; 55 pages; 2018.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/w65c816s-chip.cfm 65C816 webpage] - Western Design Center\n* [http://axis.llx.com/~nparker/a2/opcodes.html 6502/65C02/65C816 Instruction Set decoded]\n* [http://www.zophar.net/tech/65816.html 65816/65C816 Technical Documents] - zophar.net\n* [http://www.defence-force.org/computing/oric/coding/annexe_2/ A 6502 Programmer's Introduction to the 65816] &ndash; A ''Commodore World'' article by Brett Tabke; includes [[Creative Micro Designs|CMD]]'s instruction set summary\n* [http://sbc.bcstechnology.net/65c816interrupts.html Investigating 65C816 Interrupts] &ndash; An extensive discussion of interrupt processing on the 65C816\n<!--- *[http://www.winbond-usa.com/mambo/content/view/286/523/#ProductSelectionGuide Winbond TV Edutainment IC Selection Guide] &ndash; ICs with 65816 CPU core --->\n\n{{FOLDOC}}\n\n{{MOS CPU}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:WDC 65816 65802}}\n[[Category:65xx microprocessors]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1983]]\n[[Category:16-bit microprocessors]]\n", "name_user": "130.193.221.19", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC_65C816"}

Carmel Hill belongs to the mountain range of [[Collserola]] \u2013 the [[Parc del Carmel]] is located on the northern face. Park G\u00fcell is located in [[La Salut]], a neighborhood in the [[Gr\u00e0cia district]] of Barcelona. With urbanization in mind, [[Eusebi G\u00fcell]] assigned the design of the park to [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]], a renowned architect and the face of [[Catalan modernism]].\n\nThe park was built from 1900 to 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. In 1984, [[UNESCO]] declared the park a [[World Heritage Site]] under \"[[Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]\".<ref name=gaudiunesco>{{Citation | title =Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed |publisher = Unesco| url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/320 | accessdate = 15 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2016}}\nPark G\u00fcell is the reflection of Gaud\u00ed's artistic plenitude, which belongs to his [[naturalist]] phase (first decade of the 20th century). During this period, the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes. He put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry. To that, the Catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative, ornamental creation. Starting from a sort of baroquism, his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises. In the design of Park G\u00fcell, Gaud\u00ed unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the [[Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family]] (Catalan: [[Sagrada Familia]]).\n\nG\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed conceived this park, situated within a natural park. They imagined an organized grouping of high-quality homes, decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort, finished off with an artistic touch. They also envisioned a community strongly influenced by [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], since, in the common elements of the park, they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect: therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political [[Catalanism]] \u2013  especially in the entrance stairway where the [[Catalan countries]] are represented \u2013 and from [[Catholicism]] \u2013 the [[Monumento al Calvario]], originally designed to be a [[chapel]]. The [[mythological]] elements are so important: apparently G\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed's conception of the park was also inspired by the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] of [[Delphi]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nOn the other hand, many experts{{Who|date=April 2016}} have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex [[iconography]] that Gaud\u00ed applied to the urban project. Such references go from political vindication to [[religious]] exaltation, passing through [[mythology]], [[history]] and [[philosophy]]. Specifically, many studies claim to see references to [[Freemasonry]], despite the deep religious beliefs of both Gaud\u00ed and [[Count G\u00fcell]]. These references have not been proven in the [[historiography]] of the modern architect. The multiplicity of symbols found in the Park G\u00fcell is, as previously mentioned, associated to political and religious signs, with a touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for enigmas and [[puzzles]].\n\nSorry \nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\nYou gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty\nYou know I try but I don't do too well with apologies\nI hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?\n'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness\nI know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice\nBy once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times\nSo let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight\n'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances\nYeah, is it too late now to say sorry?\n'Cause I'm missing more than just your body\nOh, is it too late now to say sorry?\nYeah, I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?\nOoh, ooh\nI'm sorry, yeah\nOoh, ooh\nSorry, yeah\nOoh, ooh\nSorry\nYeah, I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?\nOoh, ooh\nI'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to\nBut you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two\nI'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth\nCan we both say the words and forget this?\nYeah, is it too late now to say sorry?\n'Cause I'm missing more than just your body\nOh, is it too late now to say sorry?\nYeah, I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?\nI'm not just trying to get you back on me\n'Cause I'm missing more than just your body\nIs it too late now to say sorry?\nYeah, I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?\nOoh, ooh\nI'm sorry, yeah\nOoh, ooh\nSorry, yeah\nOoh, ooh\nSorry\nYeah, I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?\nOoh, ooh\nI'm sorry, yeah\nOoh, ooh\nSorry, yeah\nOoh, ooh\nSorry\nYeah, I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?\n\n== Municipal garden ==\n[[File:Parc G\u00fcell Dragon Restored.jpg|left|thumb|Gaud\u00ed's multicolored [[mosaic]] salamander, popularly known as \"el drac\" (the dragon), at the main entrance, as restored after the vandalism of February 2007]]\n[[File:Park Guell Terrace.JPG|left|thumb|Gaud\u00ed's mosaic work on the main terrace]]\n\nIt has since been converted into a municipal garden. It can be reached by underground railway (although the stations are at a distance from the Park and at a much lower level below the hill), by city buses, or by commercial tourist buses. Since October 2013 there is an entrance fee to visit the Monumental Zone (main entrance, terrace, and the parts containing mosaics), but the entrance to the Park remains free. Gaud\u00ed's house, \"la Torre Rosa,\" \u2013 containing furniture that he designed \u2013 can be only visited for another entrance fee. There is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both Gaud\u00ed's house and the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]] Church.\n\nPark G\u00fcell is designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park. The buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by Gaud\u00ed. These two buildings make up the Porter's Lodge pavilion.<ref>https://parkguell.barcelona/en/park-guell/emblematic-features/entrance-pavilions</ref> One of these buildings contains a small room with a telephone booth.  The other, while once being the porter's house, is now a permanent exhibition of the [[Barcelona City History Museum]] MUHBA focused on the building itself, the park and the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=MUHBA Park G\u00fcell|url=http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/museuhistoria/en/muhba-park-guell}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXEGigoEa5k|title=LMVC UPC CPSV. MUHBA. Levantamiento del Parc G\u00fcell Casa del Guarda|date=3 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nThe focal point of the park is the main terrace, surrounded by a long bench in the form of a [[sea serpent]]. The curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. Gaud\u00ed incorporated many motifs of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the Park. Much of the design of the benches was the work not of Gaud\u00ed but of his often overlooked collaborator [[Josep Maria Jujol]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/sep/09/gaudis-partner-in-iconic-barcelona-design-finally-gets-the-limelight |title=Gaud\u00ed's partner in iconic Barcelona design finally gets the limelight |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Stephen |last=Burgen |date=2016-09-09 |accessdate=2016-09-09}}</ref>\n\nRoadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by Gaud\u00ed as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. This minimized the intrusion of the roads, and Gaud\u00ed designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. His structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his [[Church of Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]] so that the [[Inverted catenary|inverted catenary arch]] shapes form perfect compression structures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dataphys.org/list/gaudis-hanging-chain-models/ |title=1889 \u2013 Gaud\u00ed's Hanging Chain Models |website=List of Physical Visualizations |access-date=8 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt the park's high-point, there is a stone hill composed of steps leading up to a platform which holds three large crosses. The official name of this is \"El Tur\u00f3 de les Tres Creus,\" however many tourists choose to call it Calvary. Two of the crosses point north\u2013south and east\u2013west, the third, and tallest cross, points skyward. This lookout offers the most complete view of Barcelona and the bay. It is possible to view the main city in panorama, with the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (another one of Antoni Guad\u00ed's famous creations), the Agbar Tower, and the [[Montju\u00efc]] area visible at a distance.\n\nThe park supports a wide variety of wildlife, notably several of the non-native species of [[parrot]] found in the Barcelona area.

Carmel Hill belongs to the mountain range of [[Collserola]] \u2013 the [[Parc del Carmel]] is located on the northern face. Park G\u00fcell is located in [[La Salut]], a neighborhood in the [[Gr\u00e0cia district]] of Barcelona. With urbanization in mind, [[Eusebi G\u00fcell]] assigned the design of the park to [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]], a renowned architect and the face of [[Catalan modernism]].\n\nThe park was built from 1900 to 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. In 1984, [[UNESCO]] declared the park a [[World Heritage Site]] under \"[[Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]\".<ref name=gaudiunesco>{{Citation | title =Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed |publisher = Unesco| url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/320 | accessdate = 15 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2016}}\nPark G\u00fcell is the reflection of Gaud\u00ed's artistic plenitude, which belongs to his [[naturalist]] phase (first decade of the 20th century). During this period, the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes. He put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry. To that, the Catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative, ornamental creation. Starting from a sort of baroquism, his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises. In the design of Park G\u00fcell, Gaud\u00ed unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the [[Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family]] (Catalan: [[Sagrada Familia]]).\n\nG\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed conceived this park, situated within a natural park. They imagined an organized grouping of high-quality homes, decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort, finished off with an artistic touch. They also envisioned a community strongly influenced by [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], since, in the common elements of the park, they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect: therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political [[Catalanism]] \u2013  especially in the entrance stairway where the [[Catalan countries]] are represented \u2013 and from [[Catholicism]] \u2013 the [[Monumento al Calvario]], originally designed to be a [[chapel]]. The [[mythological]] elements are so important: apparently G\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed's conception of the park was also inspired by the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] of [[Delphi]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nOn the other hand, many experts{{Who|date=April 2016}} have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex [[iconography]] that Gaud\u00ed applied to the urban project. Such references go from political vindication to [[religious]] exaltation, passing through [[mythology]], [[history]] and [[philosophy]]. Specifically, many studies claim to see references to [[Freemasonry]], despite the deep religious beliefs of both Gaud\u00ed and [[Count G\u00fcell]]. These references have not been proven in the [[historiography]] of the modern architect. The multiplicity of symbols found in the Park G\u00fcell is, as previously mentioned, associated to political and religious signs, with a touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for enigmas and [[puzzles]].\n\n==Origins as a housing development==\n[[File:Barcelona 193.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Gaudi House Museum]]]]\nThe park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site, the idea of Count [[Eusebi G\u00fcell]], after whom the park was named. It was inspired by the English [[garden city movement]]; hence the original English name ''Park'' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] the name is \"Parc G\u00fcell\"). The site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees, called ''Muntanya Pelada'' (Bare Mountain). It already included a large country house called Larrard House or Muntaner de Dalt House and was next to a neighbourhood of upper-class houses called ''La Salut'' (The Health). The intention was to exploit the fresh air (well away from smoky factories) and beautiful views from the site, with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses. Count Eusebi G\u00fcell added to the prestige of the development by moving in 1906 to live in Larrard House. Ultimately, only two houses were built, neither designed by Gaud\u00ed. One was intended to be a show house, but on being completed in 1904 was put up for sale, and as no buyers came forward, Gaud\u00ed, at G\u00fcell's suggestion, bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in 1906.<ref name=zim>{{Citation | last = Zimmermann | first = Robert | year =2002 | title =The Best of Gaud\u00ed | place = | publisher = | url =http://www.sola-sole.com/bgaudi.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702205603/http://www.sola-sole.com/bgaudi.pdf|archive-date=22 July 2007}}</ref> This house, where Gaud\u00ed lived from 1906 to 1926, was built by Francesc Berenguer in 1904. It contains original works by Gaud\u00ed and several of his collaborators. It is now the [[Gaudi House Museum]] (Casa Museu Gaud\u00ed) since 1963. In 1969 it was declared a historical artistic monument of national interest.\n\n== Municipal garden ==\n[[File:Parc G\u00fcell Dragon Restored.jpg|left|thumb|Gaud\u00ed's multicolored [[mosaic]] salamander, popularly known as \"el drac\" (the dragon), at the main entrance, as restored after the vandalism of February 2007]]\n[[File:Park Guell Terrace.JPG|left|thumb|Gaud\u00ed's mosaic work on the main terrace]]\n\nIt has since been converted into a municipal garden. It can be reached by underground railway (although the stations are at a distance from the Park and at a much lower level below the hill), by city buses, or by commercial tourist buses. Since October 2013 there is an entrance fee to visit the Monumental Zone (main entrance, terrace, and the parts containing mosaics), but the entrance to the Park remains free. Gaud\u00ed's house, \"la Torre Rosa,\" \u2013 containing furniture that he designed \u2013 can be only visited for another entrance fee. There is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both Gaud\u00ed's house and the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]] Church.\n\nPark G\u00fcell is designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park. The buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by Gaud\u00ed. These two buildings make up the Porter's Lodge pavilion.<ref>https://parkguell.barcelona/en/park-guell/emblematic-features/entrance-pavilions</ref> One of these buildings contains a small room with a telephone booth.  The other, while once being the porter's house, is now a permanent exhibition of the [[Barcelona City History Museum]] MUHBA focused on the building itself, the park and the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=MUHBA Park G\u00fcell|url=http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/museuhistoria/en/muhba-park-guell}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXEGigoEa5k|title=LMVC UPC CPSV.

The curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. Gaud\u00ed incorporated many motifs of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the Park. Much of the design of the benches was the work not of Gaud\u00ed but of his often overlooked collaborator [[Josep Maria Jujol]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/sep/09/gaudis-partner-in-iconic-barcelona-design-finally-gets-the-limelight |title=Gaud\u00ed's partner in iconic Barcelona design finally gets the limelight |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Stephen |last=Burgen |date=2016-09-09 |accessdate=2016-09-09}}</ref>\n\nRoadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by Gaud\u00ed as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. This minimized the intrusion of the roads, and Gaud\u00ed designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. His structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his [[Church of Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]] so that the [[Inverted catenary|inverted catenary arch]] shapes form perfect compression structures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dataphys.org/list/gaudis-hanging-chain-models/ |title=1889 \u2013 Gaud\u00ed's Hanging Chain Models |website=List of Physical Visualizations |access-date=8 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt the park's high-point, there is a stone hill composed of steps leading up to a platform which holds three large crosses. The official name of this is \"El Tur\u00f3 de les Tres Creus,\" however many tourists choose to call it Calvary. Two of the crosses point north\u2013south and east\u2013west, the third, and tallest cross, points skyward. This lookout offers the most complete view of Barcelona and the bay. It is possible to view the main city in panorama, with the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (another one of Antoni Guad\u00ed's famous creations), the Agbar Tower, and the [[Montju\u00efc]] area visible at a distance.\n\nThe park supports a wide variety of wildlife, notably several of the non-native species of [[parrot]] found in the Barcelona area. Other birds can be seen from the park, with records including [[Short-toed snake eagle|short-toed eagle]]. The park also supports a population of [[Macroglossum stellatarum|hummingbird hawk moths]].\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Gallery of images==\n<gallery>\nFile:View from Park G\u00fcell Terrace.jpg| View from the main terrace of the park.\nFile:Goelenterance06390139.JPG|Entrance to the Park.\nFile:Goeldoric06390141.JPG|Doric columns support the roof of the lower court which forms the central terrace, with serpentine seating round its edge.\nFile:Goelbench06390140.JPG|The unique shape of the serpentine bench enables the people sitting on it to converse privately, although the square is large.

Seaman]]. Based on [[Dr. Seuss]]'s [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!|1957 book of the same name]], it was the first Dr. Seuss book to be adapted into a full-length feature film. The film is narrated by [[Anthony Hopkins]] and stars [[Jim Carrey]] in the [[Grinch|title role]] along with [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[Christine Baranski]], [[Bill Irwin]] and [[Molly Shannon]] in supporting roles, as well as introducing [[Taylor Momsen]] as Cindy Lou Who.\n\nBecause the film is based on a children's picture book, many additions were made to the storyline in order to bring it up to feature-length, including some information about the backstory of the title character and reworking the story's minor character Cindy Lou Who as a main character. Most of the rhymes that were used in the book were also used in the film, though some of the lines were to some degree changed and several new rhymes were put in. The film also borrowed some music and character elements that originated in the [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|1966 animated television special]], such as the song \"[[You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch]]\" and the Grinch's green skin tone.\n\nProduced by Howard and [[Brian Grazer]]'s [[Imagine Entertainment]], ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'' was released by [[Universal Pictures]] in the United States on November 17 and received mixed reviews from critics who criticized the screenplay, characters and innuendos but praised the musical score, Carrey\u2019s performance and production values. The film grossed over $345 million worldwide, becoming the [[2000 in film|sixth-highest grossing film of 2000]] and was originally the second highest-grossing holiday film of all-time behind ''[[Home Alone]]'' (1990), until both films were surpassed in 2018 by the [[The Grinch (film)|third film adaptation of the story]].<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref>{{cite book| title=Guinness World Records 2007| url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec2007guin|url-access=registration| publisher=Guinness World Records Limited| year=2006| page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec2007guin/page/n197 182] (UK edition)| chapter=Arts & Media| isbn=978-1-9049-9412-1}}</ref> It won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]] as well as getting nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please refer to WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Plots for films should be between 400-700 words. Also see [[User:NinjaRobotPirate/How to streamline a plot summary]] for excellent tips. -->\nAll the residents of [[Whoville]] (Whos) enjoy celebrating [[Christmas]]. The [[Grinch]], a misanthropic and devious green-furred creature, arrives in Whoville as a baby and was adopted by two elderly sisters. He was a timid child who had a crush on Martha May Whovier, one of the prettiest girls in his school, who showed empathy towards him. Bully Augustus May Who, however, was jealous that Martha liked the Grinch more than him and began to mock him for having a beard. Because of this, the Grinch cut his face while attempting to shave, to which his classmates \u2014 except Martha \u2014 laughed at him and caused the Grinch to lose his temper and declare that he hates Christmas. He fled to the top of Mount Crumpit, north of Whoville, for which he lived there.\n\n53 years later, nobody likes the Grinch due to the harmful stunts he pulls on them. Meanwhile, six-year-old Cindy Lou Who believes that everyone is missing the point about Christmas by focusing too much on the gifts and festivities and too little on the personal relationships. She then has a face-to-face encounter with the Grinch at the post office and later discovers his tragic past.\n\nCindy nominates the Grinch to be the town's \"Holiday Cheermeister\", much to the displeasure of May Who, who is now the mayor of Whoville. Cindy climbs to Mount Crumpit to invite the Grinch to the celebration and he eventually accepts. As Cheermeister, the Grinch participates in several events and begins to have fun, but May Who reminds him of his childhood humiliation by giving him an electric shaver as a present before publicly proposing marriage to Martha and giving her a gaudy engagement ring. Enraged, the Grinch berates the Whos for their materialism by telling them that Christmas is only about gifts that they will end up throwing in the garbage, which is dumped on Mount Crumpit near his home. He destroys the tree and goes on a rampage around Whoville, before going back home to Mt. Crumpit.\n\nFinally fed up with the Whos' Christmas, the Grinch concocts a plan to crush the Whos' Christmas spirit by stealing all of their presents, decorations and food while they're sleeping. He disguises himself as [[Santa Claus]] and dresses his dog Max as a [[reindeer]], then descends into Whoville. The first house he enters is Cindy's, and lies to Cindy when she catches him stealing their tree, allowing him to escape. The Grinch continues stealing all of the gifts, decorations and food and stuffing them all in a large sack, before climbing back to the top of Mt. Crumpit to destroy the gifts by pushing the sack off the side. When the Whos wake up on Christmas morning, they are horrified to discover the theft and May Who blames Cindy for letting this happen to Whoville. However, her cheerful father, town postmaster Lou Lou Who, comes to his daughter's defense by explaining to Maywho and all of the other Whos that he has finally figured out what Cindy has been trying to tell the whole town \u2014 Christmas is mainly about love of family and friends, not just gifts and fancy lights. The Whos agree with Lou and start singing Whoville's Christmas carol.\n\nBefore the Grinch can push the stolen gifts off the top of Mount Crumpit, he hears the Whos singing and realizes that he has failed to prevent Christmas, but then has an epiphany and finally realizes the true meaning of Christmas, causing his heart to grow three sizes. The sleigh full of gifts begins to slide over the edge of the cliff along with Cindy, who had come to spend Christmas with him. The Grinch gets the strength to lift the loaded sleigh and carry Cindy to safety, and they ride down the mountain to return the gifts.\n\nThe Grinch apologizes for the burglary and surrenders himself to the police, who accept his apology and deny May Who's request to arrest and [[pepper spray]] the Grinch. Martha even turns down May Who's proposal and returns his engagement ring to him, declaring that her heart belongs to the Grinch. Afterwards, the redeemed Grinch joins in the Whos' celebration feast and carves the roast beast himself in his cave.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as [[the Grinch]], a misanthropic and devious green-furred creature who despises Christmas and the Whos of Whoville. It is revealed in his origin story that he started to hate Christmas after his school classmates mocked him for trying to shave his face.

Geisel visited the set in October 1999. Much of the Whoville set was constructed on the backlot of [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal Studios]] behind the Bates Motel set from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. [[Rick Baker]] was hired to design and create the film's prosthetic makeup for Carrey and the rest of the cast. It took a number of tests, and ultimately Carrey admiring a photo of Baker in his first test makeup, for the decision to use Baker's original makeup design. The Grinch suit was covered in yak hair, dyed green and sewed onto a spandex suit. The application of the makeup took up to 2 and a half hours, after which a frustrated Carrey kicked a hole in the wall of his trailer. Carrey's makeup artist [[Kazuhiro Tsuji]] took the most from Carrey's anger. \"On set, [Carrey] was really mean to everybody and at the beginning of the production they couldn't finish,\" Tsuji said. \"After two weeks we only could finish three days' worth of shooting schedule, because suddenly he would just disappear and when he came back, everything was ripped apart. We couldn't shoot anything.\" Tsuji left production until Baker had a discussion with Carrey on how important Tsuji was to the production.

Seaman]]. Based on [[Dr. Seuss]]'s [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!|1957 book of the same name]], it was the first Dr. Seuss book to be adapted into a full-length feature film. The film is narrated by [[Anthony Hopkins]] and stars [[Jim Carrey]] in the [[Grinch|title role]] along with [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[Christine Baranski]], [[Bill Irwin]] and [[Molly Shannon]] in supporting roles, as well as introducing [[Taylor Momsen]] as Cindy Lou Who.\n\nBecause the film is based on a children's picture book, many additions were made to the storyline in order to bring it up to feature-length, including some information about the backstory of the title character and reworking the story's minor character Cindy Lou Who as a main character. Most of the rhymes that were used in the book were also used in the film, though some of the lines were to some degree changed and several new rhymes were put in. The film also borrowed some music and character elements that originated in the [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|1966 animated television special]], such as the song \"[[You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch]]\" and the Grinch's green skin tone.\n\nProduced by Howard and [[Brian Grazer]]'s [[Imagine Entertainment]], ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'' was released by [[Universal Pictures]] in the United States on November 17 and received mixed reviews from critics who criticized the screenplay, characters and innuendos but praised the musical score, Carrey\u2019s performance and production values. The film grossed over $345 million worldwide, becoming the [[2000 in film|sixth-highest grossing film of 2000]] and was originally the second highest-grossing holiday film of all-time behind ''[[Home Alone]]'' (1990), until both films were surpassed in 2018 by the [[The Grinch (film)|third film adaptation of the story]].<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref>{{cite book| title=Guinness World Records 2007| url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec2007guin|url-access=registration| publisher=Guinness World Records Limited| year=2006| page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec2007guin/page/n197 182] (UK edition)| chapter=Arts & Media| isbn=978-1-9049-9412-1}}</ref> It won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]] as well as getting nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please refer to WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Plots for films should be between 400-700 words. Also see [[User:NinjaRobotPirate/How to streamline a plot summary]] for excellent tips. -->\nAll the residents of [[Whoville]] (Whos) enjoy celebrating [[Christmas]]. The [[Grinch]], a misanthropic and devious green-furred creature, arrives in Whoville as a baby and was adopted by two elderly sisters. He was a timid child who had a crush on Martha May Whovier, one of the prettiest girls in his school, who showed empathy towards him. Bully Augustus May Who, however, was jealous that Martha liked the Grinch more than him and began to mock him for having a beard. Because of this, the Grinch cut his face while attempting to shave, to which his classmates \u2014 except Martha \u2014 laughed at him and caused the Grinch to lose his temper and declare that he hates Christmas. He fled to the top of Mount Crumpit, north of Whoville, for which he lived there.\n\n53 years later, nobody likes the Grinch due to the harmful stunts he pulls on them. Meanwhile, six-year-old Cindy Lou Who believes that everyone is missing the point about Christmas by focusing too much on the gifts and festivities and too little on the personal relationships. She then has a face-to-face encounter with the Grinch at the post office and later discovers his tragic past.\n\nCindy nominates the Grinch to be the town's \"Holiday Cheermeister\", much to the displeasure of May Who, who is now the mayor of Whoville. Cindy climbs to Mount Crumpit to invite the Grinch to the celebration and he eventually accepts. As Cheermeister, the Grinch participates in several events and begins to have fun, but May Who reminds him of his childhood humiliation by giving him an electric shaver as a present before publicly proposing marriage to Martha and giving her a gaudy engagement ring. Enraged, the Grinch berates the Whos for their materialism by telling them that Christmas is only about gifts that they will end up throwing in the garbage, which is dumped on Mount Crumpit near his home. He destroys the tree and goes on a rampage around Whoville, before going back home to Mt. Crumpit.\n\nFinally fed up with the Whos' Christmas, the Grinch concocts a plan to crush the Whos' Christmas spirit by stealing all of their presents, decorations and food while they're sleeping. He disguises himself as [[Santa Claus]] and dresses his dog Max as a [[reindeer]], then descends into Whoville. The first house he enters is Cindy's, and lies to Cindy when she catches him stealing their tree, allowing him to escape. The Grinch continues stealing all of the gifts, decorations and food and stuffing them all in a large sack, before climbing back to the top of Mt. Crumpit to destroy the gifts by pushing the sack off the side. When the Whos wake up on Christmas morning, they are horrified to discover the theft and May Who blames Cindy for letting this happen to Whoville. However, her cheerful father, town postmaster Lou Lou Who, comes to his daughter's defense by explaining to Maywho and all of the other Whos that he has finally figured out what Cindy has been trying to tell the whole town \u2014 Christmas is mainly about love of family and friends, not just gifts and fancy lights. The Whos agree with Lou and start singing Whoville's Christmas carol.\n\nBefore the Grinch can push the stolen gifts off the top of Mount Crumpit, he hears the Whos singing and realizes that he has failed to prevent Christmas, but then has an epiphany and finally realizes the true meaning of Christmas, causing his heart to grow three sizes. The sleigh full of gifts begins to slide over the edge of the cliff along with Cindy, who had come to spend Christmas with him. The Grinch gets the strength to lift the loaded sleigh and carry Cindy to safety, and they ride down the mountain to return the gifts.\n\nThe Grinch apologizes for the burglary and surrenders himself to the police, who accept his apology and deny May Who's request to arrest and [[pepper spray]] the Grinch. Martha even turns down May Who's proposal and returns his engagement ring to him, declaring that her heart belongs to the Grinch. Afterwards, the redeemed Grinch joins in the Whos' celebration feast and carves the roast beast himself in his cave.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as [[the Grinch]], a misanthropic and devious green-furred creature who despises Christmas and the Whos of Whoville.

[[Rick Baker]] was hired to design and create the film's prosthetic makeup for Carrey and the rest of the cast. It took a number of tests, and ultimately Carrey admiring a photo of Baker in his first test makeup, for the decision to use Baker's original makeup design. The Grinch suit was covered in yak hair, dyed green and sewed onto a spandex suit. The application of the makeup took up to 2 and a half hours, after which a frustrated Carrey kicked a hole in the wall of his trailer. Carrey's makeup artist [[Kazuhiro Tsuji]] took the most from Carrey's anger. \"On set, [Carrey] was really mean to everybody and at the beginning of the production they couldn't finish,\" Tsuji said. \"After two weeks we only could finish three days' worth of shooting schedule, because suddenly he would just disappear and when he came back, everything was ripped apart.

Mitchell's skill at combining dance and acting was considered something of a novelty; in 1959, the critic [[Olga Maynard]] singled him out as \"an important example of the new dancer-actor-singer in American ballet\", pointing to his interpretive abilities and \"masculine\" technique.<ref>Olga Maynard, ''The American Ballet'' (Philadelphia: Macrae Smith, 1959), 149.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMitchell was born on [[Leap Day]], 1920 in [[Sacramento, California]]. His parents emigrated from [[England]] to [[Northern California]], where they operated a fruit farm in [[Turlock, California|Turlock]]. In 1923, Mitchell's mother, Edith, left his father and returned to England with Mitchell's brother and sister; she and Mitchell had no further contact. Unable to run a farm while single-handedly raising his remaining son, Mitchell's father fostered him out for several years to vaudevillians Gene and Katherine King.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAfter Mitchell's mother died, however, his father remarried and brought both of his sons, but not his daughter, back to Turlock. At age seventeen, Mitchell left Turlock for [[Los Angeles]], where he remained close to the Kings.<ref>Early life: virtually identical accounts with more or less detail in Meredith Brown, \"James Mitchell: Dancing His Way into Your Heart,\" ''Soap Opera Digest'' 5.17 (October 28, 1980): 40-41; Robert Schork, \"Flying High,\" ''Soap Opera Magazine'' 7.45 (18 November 1997): 21-23; \"Rebecca Herbst & James Mitchell,\" ''Soapography'' (aired September 2, 2006).</ref>\n\n==Stage and film career==\nWhile studying drama at [[Los Angeles City College]], Mitchell was introduced to modern dance at the school of the famed teacher and choreographer, [[Lester Horton]]. After receiving his associate degree, he joined Horton's company, where he remained for nearly four years. While working with Horton, he became a close friend of dancer [[Bella Lewitzky]]; in the 1970s, he became President of the Board of Directors of her Dance Foundation, and afterwards remained a \"major longtime [\u2026] supporter\" of hers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dance90210.com/bellasegal.html| title=Lewitzky Closes an Era with a Warning for the Future|publisher=|accessdate=2007-07-07|year=1994}}</ref> In 1944, Horton took Mitchell to [[New York City|New York]] with him to form a new dance company, but the venture abruptly collapsed.\n\nAs it happened, the failure of Horton's company was a significant turning point in Mitchell's career: while struggling to find either acting or dancing roles in New York, he successfully auditioned for [[Agnes de Mille]], who was choreographing her first musical since ''[[Oklahoma!]]''. Mitchell, who did not study ballet until he was in his mid-twenties,<ref>Saul Goodman, \"Brief Biographies: James Mitchell,\" ''Dance Magazine'' 29.8 (August 1955): 36.</ref> was at a loss when faced with de Mille's ballet combination. Much later, describing his approach to the audition, he said, \"Well, I really hadn't too much familiarity with that but I threw myself across the floor and about the third or fourth pass, Agnes cried 'Stop' and summoned me over and said 'Where on earth did you get your dance training?'\".<ref>James Mitchell, \"Dance Magazine Awards 1978\", ''Dance Magazine'' 52.7 (July 1978): 79. Transcript.</ref> De Mille nevertheless offered him the dual position of principal dancer and assistant choreographer.  Given the option between touring with [[Helen Hayes]] and dancing for de Mille, he chose de Mille.<ref>Michael Portantiere, \"From the Scrapbook of James Mitchell\", ''In Theater'' 87 (24 May 1999): p. 30.</ref>\n\n''[[Bloomer Girl]]'' (1944) began an important artistic partnership with de Mille that lasted from 1944 to 1969 and spanned theater, film, television, and concert dance. De Mille's biographer, Carol Easton, describes him as the \"quintessential male de Mille dancer\" and de Mille's \"closest confidant\" in her artistic life.<ref>Carol Easton, ''No Intermissions: The Life of Agnes de Mille'', new ed. (New York: Da Capo, 2000), 233, 258. {{ISBN|978-0-306-80975-0}}</ref> In one of her autobiographical volumes, de Mille herself said of Mitchell that he had \"probably the strongest arms in the business, and the adagio style developed by him and his partners has become since a valued addition to ballet vocabulary.\"<ref>Agnes de Mille, ''And Promenade Home'' (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1958), 195. Dance teacher and historian Shelley C. Berg comments that \"Mitchell's ability to execute strenuous lifts has made his parts in de Mille ballets a particular challenge for dancers later performing his roles.\" Berg, \"Saving a Legacy: Agnes de Mille's 'Gold Rush,'\" ''Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research'' 19.1 (Summer 2001): 89 n. 56.</ref>\n\nWhen, nearly thirty years later, an interviewer asked Mitchell to respond to de Mille's comments, he offered a more modest assessment of his career: \"I was primarily an actor [...] and I think what Agnes was referring to was my acting and regard for the woman I was partnering. Because in the end I really was a partner.  When I look at today's dancers, or I look at the great dance films, such as ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]''--I couldn't do any of that! I know I was a dancer, but I didn't have the technique.

After that, it took over two decades before he made his next and what proved to be his final appearance on the big screen, ''[[The Turning Point (1977 film)|The Turning Point]]'' (1977). He also co-starred with Thelma \"Tad\" Tadlock in the famous sponsored film ''[[A Touch of Magic]]'' presented by [[General Motors]] at the 1961 [[Motorama]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nBesides performing, Mitchell occasionally worked as a director and choreographer, particularly in the late 1960s and 1970s. He staged musicals at the [[Paper Mill Playhouse]], the [[Mark Taper Forum]], and [[The Muny]], among other theatres. In 1956, he and Katherine Litz co-staged ''The Enchanted'' for American Ballet Theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Television career==\nOn television, Mitchell was considerably more active, especially in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In addition to working regularly as a dancer, he played dramatic roles in a number of television films and prime-time series, as well as in the anthologies that were once so popular, such as [[Play of the Week]], Gruen Guild Playhouse, and [[Armstrong Circle Theatre]]. In 1964, he took his first contract role on a soap opera in ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', as the corrupt Captain Lloyd Griffin. In 1966, he appeared in an episode of the espionage drama ''[[Blue Light (TV series)|Blue Light]]''. This was followed by a role in the entire run of the soap opera ''[[Where the Heart Is (US TV series)|Where the Heart Is]]'' (1969\u201373), in which he played the male lead, Julian Hathaway.\n\nHowever, after ''Mack & Mabel'' flopped in 1974, Mitchell's performing career nearly ended altogether. He earned a BA from [[Empire State College]] and an MFA from [[Goddard College]] in order to teach full-time at the college level, and taught movement for actors at [[Juilliard]], [[Yale University]], and [[Drake University]]. After a few years of almost no work &ndash; although he was a guest star on ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'' and ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' in the late 1970s, he once summed up the 1970s as \"I cried and did a lot of gardening\".<ref>Sheryl Khan, \"The Gypsy in His Soul\", ''Episodes'' May/June 1993: p. 62.</ref>\n\nHe was hired in 1979 as self-made millionaire Palmer Cortlandt on ABC's long-running soap opera ''[[All My Children]]''. Initially hired for only one year, he remained on contract through 2009. For much of his first decade on the show, Palmer was a ruthless villain, totally possessive of his daughter, Nina and violently threatening his ex-wife Daisy with being attacked by dobermans when she came back from the dead. After the introduction of [[David Canary]] in December 1983 as [[Adam Chandler]], Palmer remained ruthless in business dealings, but toned down in romantic relationships. His old ways returned several times, such as when he was revealed to be hoarding stolen artwork and when he tried to kill his last wife, Vanessa, after falsely believing that she had cheated on him. His final appearance as a contract player was September 19, 2008, although his retirement was not made official until September 30, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/soaps/all-my-children/2009/09/amcs-move-the-list-is-finally-released|title=AMC's Move: The List is Finally Released|accessdate=2009-09-30|date=2009-09-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004191700/http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/soaps/all-my-children/2009/09/amcs-move-the-list-is-finally-released|archivedate=2009-10-04}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nMitchell's partner of thirty-nine years<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/27/fashion/albert-wolskys-return-to-broadway.html?_r=0|title=Albert Wolsky's Return to Broadway|accessdate=2012-12-27|date=2012-12-27|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Boucher|first1=Vincent}}</ref> was the Oscar-award-winning costume designer [[Albert Wolsky]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/01/23/All_My_Children_Star_James_Mitchell_Dead_at_89/ |title=All My Children Star James Mitchell Dead at 89 |accessdate=2010-01-23 |date=2010-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125004958/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/01/23/All_My_Children_Star_James_Mitchell_Dead_at_89/ |archivedate=2010-01-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nJames Mitchell died on January 22, 2010, in Los Angeles.

Mitchell's skill at combining dance and acting was considered something of a novelty; in 1959, the critic [[Olga Maynard]] singled him out as \"an important example of the new dancer-actor-singer in American ballet\", pointing to his interpretive abilities and \"masculine\" technique.<ref>Olga Maynard, ''The American Ballet'' (Philadelphia: Macrae Smith, 1959), 149.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMitchell was born on [[Leap Day]], 1920 in [[Sacramento, California]]. His parents emigrated from [[England]] to [[Northern California]], where they operated a fruit farm in [[Turlock, California|Turlock]]. In 1923, Mitchell's mother, Edith, left his father and returned to England with Mitchell's brother and sister; she and Mitchell had no further contact. Unable to run a farm while single-handedly raising his remaining son, Mitchell's father fostered him out for several years to vaudevillians Gene and Katherine King.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAfter Mitchell's mother died, however, his father remarried and brought both of his sons, but not his daughter, back to Turlock. At age seventeen, Mitchell left Turlock for [[Los Angeles]], where he remained close to the Kings.<ref>Early life: virtually identical accounts with more or less detail in Meredith Brown, \"James Mitchell: Dancing His Way into Your Heart,\" ''Soap Opera Digest'' 5.17 (October 28, 1980): 40-41; Robert Schork, \"Flying High,\" ''Soap Opera Magazine'' 7.45 (18 November 1997): 21-23; \"Rebecca Herbst & James Mitchell,\" ''Soapography'' (aired September 2, 2006).</ref>\n\n==Stage and film career==\nWhile studying drama at [[Los Angeles City College]], Mitchell was introduced to modern dance at the school of the famed teacher and choreographer, [[Lester Horton]]. After receiving his associate degree, he joined Horton's company, where he remained for nearly four years. While working with Horton, he became a close friend of dancer [[Bella Lewitzky]]; in the 1970s, he became President of the Board of Directors of her Dance Foundation, and afterwards remained a \"major longtime [\u2026] supporter\" of hers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dance90210.com/bellasegal.html| title=Lewitzky Closes an Era with a Warning for the Future|publisher=|accessdate=2007-07-07|year=1994}}</ref> In 1944, Horton took Mitchell to [[New York City|New York]] with him to form a new dance company, but the venture abruptly collapsed.\n\nAs it happened, the failure of Horton's company was a significant turning point in Mitchell's career: while struggling to find either acting or dancing roles in New York, he successfully auditioned for [[Agnes de Mille]], who was choreographing her first musical since ''[[Oklahoma!]]''. Mitchell, who did not study ballet until he was in his mid-twenties,<ref>Saul Goodman, \"Brief Biographies: James Mitchell,\" ''Dance Magazine'' 29.8 (August 1955): 36.</ref> was at a loss when faced with de Mille's ballet combination. Much later, describing his approach to the audition, he said, \"Well, I really hadn't too much familiarity with that but I threw myself across the floor and about the third or fourth pass, Agnes cried 'Stop' and summoned me over and said 'Where on earth did you get your dance training?'\".<ref>James Mitchell, \"Dance Magazine Awards 1978\", ''Dance Magazine'' 52.7 (July 1978): 79. Transcript.</ref> De Mille nevertheless offered him the dual position of principal dancer and assistant choreographer.  Given the option between touring with [[Helen Hayes]] and dancing for de Mille, he chose de Mille.<ref>Michael Portantiere, \"From the Scrapbook of James Mitchell\", ''In Theater'' 87 (24 May 1999): p. 30.</ref>\n\n''[[Bloomer Girl]]'' (1944) began an important artistic partnership with de Mille that lasted from 1944 to 1969 and spanned theater, film, television, and concert dance. De Mille's biographer, Carol Easton, describes him as the \"quintessential male de Mille dancer\" and de Mille's \"closest confidant\" in her artistic life.<ref>Carol Easton, ''No Intermissions: The Life of Agnes de Mille'', new ed. (New York: Da Capo, 2000), 233, 258. {{ISBN|978-0-306-80975-0}}</ref> In one of her autobiographical volumes, de Mille herself said of Mitchell that he had \"probably the strongest arms in the business, and the adagio style developed by him and his partners has become since a valued addition to ballet vocabulary.\"<ref>Agnes de Mille, ''And Promenade Home'' (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1958), 195. Dance teacher and historian Shelley C. Berg comments that \"Mitchell's ability to execute strenuous lifts has made his parts in de Mille ballets a particular challenge for dancers later performing his roles.\" Berg, \"Saving a Legacy: Agnes de Mille's 'Gold Rush,'\" ''Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research'' 19.1 (Summer 2001): 89 n. 56.</ref>\n\nWhen, nearly thirty years later, an interviewer asked Mitchell to respond to de Mille's comments, he offered a more modest assessment of his career: \"I was primarily an actor [...] and I think what Agnes was referring to was my acting and regard for the woman I was partnering. Because in the end I really was a partner.  When I look at today's dancers, or I look at the great dance films, such as ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]''--I couldn't do any of that! I know I was a dancer, but I didn't have the technique.

After that, it took over two decades before he made his next and what proved to be his final appearance on the big screen, ''[[The Turning Point (1977 film)|The Turning Point]]'' (1977). He also co-starred with Thelma \"Tad\" Tadlock in the famous sponsored film ''[[A Touch of Magic]]'' presented by [[General Motors]] at the 1961 [[Motorama]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nBesides performing, Mitchell occasionally worked as a director and choreographer, particularly in the late 1960s and 1970s. He staged musicals at the [[Paper Mill Playhouse]], the [[Mark Taper Forum]], and [[The Muny]], among other theatres. In 1956, he and Katherine Litz co-staged ''The Enchanted'' for American Ballet Theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Television career==\nOn television, Mitchell was considerably more active, especially in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In addition to working regularly as a dancer, he played dramatic roles in a number of television films and prime-time series, as well as in the anthologies that were once so popular, such as [[Play of the Week]], Gruen Guild Playhouse, and [[Armstrong Circle Theatre]]. In 1964, he took his first contract role on a soap opera in ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', as the corrupt Captain Lloyd Griffin. In 1966, he appeared in an episode of the espionage drama ''[[Blue Light (TV series)|Blue Light]]''. This was followed by a role in the entire run of the soap opera ''[[Where the Heart Is (US TV series)|Where the Heart Is]]'' (1969\u201373), in which he played the male lead, Julian Hathaway.\n\nHowever, after ''Mack & Mabel'' flopped in 1974, Mitchell's performing career nearly ended altogether. He earned a BA from [[Empire State College]] and an MFA from [[Goddard College]] in order to teach full-time at the college level, and taught movement for actors at [[Juilliard]], [[Yale University]], and [[Drake University]]. After a few years of almost no work &ndash; although he was a guest star on ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'' and ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' in the late 1970s, he once summed up the 1970s as \"I cried and did a lot of gardening\".<ref>Sheryl Khan, \"The Gypsy in His Soul\", ''Episodes'' May/June 1993: p. 62.</ref>\n\nHe was hired in 1979 as self-made millionaire Palmer Cortlandt on ABC's long-running soap opera ''[[All My Children]]''. Initially hired for only one year, he remained on contract through 2009. For much of his first decade on the show, Palmer was a ruthless villain, totally possessive of his daughter, Nina and violently threatening his ex-wife Daisy with being attacked by dobermans when she came back from the dead. After the introduction of [[David Canary]] in December 1983 as [[Adam Chandler]], Palmer remained ruthless in business dealings, but toned down in romantic relationships. His old ways returned several times, such as when he was revealed to be hoarding stolen artwork and when he tried to kill his last wife, Vanessa, after falsely believing that she had cheated on him. His final appearance as a contract player was September 19, 2008, although his retirement was not made official until September 30, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/soaps/all-my-children/2009/09/amcs-move-the-list-is-finally-released|title=AMC's Move: The List is Finally Released|accessdate=2009-09-30|date=2009-09-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004191700/http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/soaps/all-my-children/2009/09/amcs-move-the-list-is-finally-released|archivedate=2009-10-04}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nMitchell's partner of thirty-nine years<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/27/fashion/albert-wolskys-return-to-broadway.html?_r=0|title=Albert Wolsky's Return to Broadway|accessdate=2012-12-27|date=2012-12-27|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Boucher|first1=Vincent}}</ref> was the Oscar-award-winning costume designer [[Albert Wolsky]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/01/23/All_My_Children_Star_James_Mitchell_Dead_at_89/ |title=All My Children Star James Mitchell Dead at 89 |accessdate=2010-01-23 |date=2010-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125004958/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/01/23/All_My_Children_Star_James_Mitchell_Dead_at_89/ |archivedate=2010-01-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nJames Mitchell died on January 22, 2010, in Los Angeles.
