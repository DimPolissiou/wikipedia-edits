Following a fund-raising in 1912 and 1913, the church was completed on 1 April 1913. The first official liturgy took place in May 1914 and the consecration took place in 1918 by Archbishop Taniel Hagopian. According to the commemorative inscription in front of the entrance it was built \"in memory of the martyrs of Cilicia, 1 April 1909\". It is considered to be the first monument in the world for the Armenian massacres, even before the [[Armenian Genocide]].\n\nThe Sourp Stepanos church is decorated with beautiful icons and its altar is made of wood (1909).

In 1773, the Hull Dock Company was formed and Hull's first dock built, on land formerly occupied by [[Hull town walls]]; in the next half century a ring of docks were built around the old down on the site of the former fortifications, known as the Town Docks \u2013  the first, The Dock (1778), (or The Old Dock, known as Queen's Dock after 1855), Humber Dock (1809), and Junction Dock (1829) \u2013 an extension, Railway Dock (1846) was opened to serve the newly built [[Hull and Selby Railway]].\n\nThe first dock east of the river, Victoria Dock, opened in 1850. Docks along the banks of the Humber to the west were begun in 1862 with the construction of the West Dock, later Albert Dock, the William Wright extension, opened in 1880, and a dock further west, St Andrew's Dock, opened in 1883. In 1885, a new eastern dock was built, Alexandra Dock, connected to a new railway line constructed by the same company, the [[Hull Barnsley & West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company]]. In 1914, King George Dock was built jointly by the competing railway companies, the Hull and Barnsley company and the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]]; this was extended in 1969 by the Queen Elizabeth Dock extension. As of 2016 Alexandra is being modernised for use in wind farm construction, with a factory, and estuary side quay under construction, a development known as Green Port Hull.\n\nThe Town Docks, Victoria Dock, and St Andrew's Dock fell out of use by the 1970s and were closed, some later infilled and redeveloped, with the Humber and Railway docks converted for leisure craft as [[Hull Marina]].\n\nOther facilities at the port included the Riverside Quay, built on the Humber banks at Albert Dock for passenger ferries and European trains, and the Corporation Pier, from which a [[Humber Ferry]] sailed to [[New Holland, Lincolnshire]]. Numerous industrial works were served by the River Hull, which also hosted a number of dry docks. To the east of Hull, [[Salt End]] near [[Hedon]] became a petroleum distribution point in the 20th&nbsp;century, with piers into the estuary for shipment, and later developed as a chemical works.\n\nAs of 2010, the main port is operated by [[Associated British Ports Holdings|Associated British Ports]] and is estimated to handle one million passengers per year; it is the main softwood timber importation port for the UK.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.abports.co.uk/custinfo/ports/hull.htm |archivedate = 16 July 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716170337/http://www.abports.co.uk/custinfo/ports/hull.htm| title = Port of Hull| publisher = Associated British Ports |accessdate = 19 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{anchor|The Haven}}{{anchor|The Old Harbour}}\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Hull.jpg|thumb|A 17th&nbsp;century map by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]] showing position of various [[staithe]]s in the Haven and the [[Fortifications of Kingston upon Hull|fortifications of the City Wall]].]]\nHull lies at a naturally advantageous position for a port, on the north side of the [[Humber Estuary]] to the west of a bend southwards giving rise to (on average) deeper water; and the [[River Hull]] flows out into the Humber at the same point.{{sfn|Lewis|1991|p=158}}<ref group=\"map\">{{Coord|53.738|-0.332|display=inline|type:landmark|name=Confluence of River Hull and Humber Estuary}} Confluence of River Hull and Humber Estuary</ref>\n\nAn important event in the history of Hull as a port was its acquisition by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]].

The site for the proposed dock was on the Humber foreshore to the west of the River Hull. The Dock Company then proposed a larger dock at the same position, which was sanctioned by an Act of Parliament in 1861{{#tag:ref|One clause of the Hull Docks Act of 1861 was that the Dock Company could be converted to a municipally owned dock trust by the Hull Corporation, additionally the dividends paid by the company were restricted: the Dock Company had been created as a private \"for profit\" company, and was subject to widespread prejudice in the town of Hull that it better served the interests of the shareholders rather than the port itself; the shareholders were characterised as being uninterested in the development of the port.<ref name=\"hh3\"/>|group=\"note\"}}<ref name=\"hh4\">{{harvnb|Sheahan|1864|pp=293\u2013295}}</ref> This dock was known as the Western Dock until its opening in 1869 when it was named Albert Dock; an extension William Wright Dock was opened 1880.<ref name=\"hh3\">{{harvnb|Allison|1969|loc= [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66776#s8 \"The Corporation and the Dock Company, 1835\u201370\"]}}</ref> A third dock (St Andrew's Dock) on the Humber foreshore west of the William Wright Dock was opened in 1883.<ref name=\"ner1\"/> All three docks where ideally suited for trans-shipment by rail as they were directly south of and parallel with the [[Hull and Selby Railway|Selby to Hull railway line]] that terminated in the centre of Hull.\n\nIn 1885, Alexandra Dock opened, which was owned and operated by the [[Hull Barnsley & West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company]]. This ended the Dock Company's monopoly on dock facilities in Hull and led to price cutting competition between the two companies for dock charges; the Dock Company was operating at a loss and from 1886 sought to merge the company into a larger organisation \u2013 the obvious choice being the North Eastern Railway.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|pp=707\u2013708}} In 1891 the Dock Company approached the North Eastern for capital to improve its Albert Dock, leading to the North Eastern Railway acquiring the shares and debts of the Dock Company in exchange for its shares. Instead of improving the Albert Dock, the North Eastern decided to expend a much greater sum on a new dock, east of the Alexandra Dock; however the proposal was opposed by both the Hull and Barnsley, and the Hull Corporation. The Dock Company and NER were legally amalgamated in 1893; one of the clauses of the Act of Parliament allowing the merger stipulated that about \u00a3500,000 would be spent on dock improvements over the next seven years.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|pp=711\u2013715}}\n\nClauses in the 1893 amalgamation bill protecting the Hull and Barnsley company prevented the NER from creating a new deep water dock without consulting the H&BR. This led to a joint proposal for a dock east of Alexandra Dock being submitted, and passed in 1899, as the \"Hull Joint Dock Act\".{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|pp=716\u2013721}} The new dock was opened in 1914 as the King George Dock.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|p=767}}\n\n===Dock ownership (1922\u2013)===\nThe Hull and Barnsley Railway became part of the North Eastern Railway in 1922,<ref name=\"gd\">{{harvnb|Parkes|1970|p=6}}</ref> making the docks in Hull the responsibility of a single company once again.

It was not until the later 1760s until the [[Hull Corporation]] acted and employed surveyors to search for a suitable site for a new harbour; at the same time the [[HM Customs|Customs]] sought an end to the need to inspect cargoes handled at the private wharves, and so wished to have the customs procedures incorporated into a new dock or wharf \u2013 a \"legal quay\".{{sfn|Baldwin|1973|pp=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Timperley|1836|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAn initial survey by [[Robert Mylne (architect)|Robert Mylne]] and [[Joseph Robson]] recommended a new harbour on the east side of the River Hull. Though the established development on the east bank tended to preclude a new port there, the same interests were unwilling to see the focus of trade shift away from the west bank where they were already established. In the early 1770s, [[John Grundy, Jr.|John Grundy]] was contracted by agriculturalists owning land reliant on the drainage of the River Hull to assess the impact of the proposed new quay on the River Hull. Grundy's report of 1772 suggested either widening the river; or using the channel behind the [[Hull Citadel]], or the moat of the [[Hull town walls]] for both harbourage and drainage \u2013 Grundy also proposed the use of gates in the channel to afford both wet and dry docks.{{sfn|Baldwin|1973|pp=2\u20133}} Reports were prepared on the cost ([[John Wooler (engineer)|John Wooler]]) and effect on the river ([[John Smeaton]]) of Grundy's proposal for a quay on the site of the town's moat. The dock was costed at between \u00a355,000 and \u00a360,000, and the quay between \u00a311,000 and \u00a312,000; while Smeaton's report indicated no issues with arising in terms of the flow of the river. After both reports had been given in early 1773 the Corporation and Customs soon reached agreement to proceed with the plan. With limited opposition only on the grounds of effect on drainage an act for the construction was obtained in 1774.{{sfn|Baldwin|1973|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nThe Old Dock, the first dock in Hull, was built between 1775 and 1778 to a design by [[Henry Berry]] and [[John Grundy, Jr.|John Grundy]]; [[Luke Holt]] acted as resident engineer, appointed on [[John Smeaton]]'s recommendation.<ref>Sources:\n*{{harvnb|Baldwin|1973|p=4}}\n*{{cite book|title = Port and harbour engineering| publisher = Ashgate| first = Adrian| last = Jarvis| year = 1998| page = 162|work = Studies in the history of civil engineering| number  =6| oclc = 237318455}}\n*{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Offfz1NSDt0C| title = Civil Engineering Heritage: Eastern and Central England| first = E.

[[Humberside Fire and Rescue Service]] had initially warned nearby residents to close doors and windows as a precautionary measure, after a tank containing 580 tonnes of [[hydrochloric acid]] sprang a leak at the dock late in the day. By the early hours of 19 September 2017, firefighters confirmed that wind was blowing the vapour away from houses near the United Molasses site, where the leak occurred, and declared the area near the dock safe.\n\nHowever, within 24 hours emergency crews had returned to the site following a change in wind direction, and a number of emergency service vehicles, including an ambulance, could be seen waiting on standby nearby. The acid was later transferred on to tankers to be taken away safely. Eight people reported signs of feeling unwell as a result of the incident. Four were assessed at the scene and discharged immediately and four were taken to hospital for further assessment. All were ultimately discharged after showing no further symptoms.

In 1773, the Hull Dock Company was formed and Hull's first dock built, on land formerly occupied by [[Hull town walls]]; in the next half century a ring of docks were built around the old down on the site of the former fortifications, known as the Town Docks \u2013  the first, The Dock (1778), (or The Old Dock, known as Queen's Dock after 1855), Humber Dock (1809), and Junction Dock (1829) \u2013 an extension, Railway Dock (1846) was opened to serve the newly built [[Hull and Selby Railway]].\n\nThe first dock east of the river, Victoria Dock, opened in 1850. Docks along the banks of the Humber to the west were begun in 1862 with the construction of the West Dock, later Albert Dock, the William Wright extension, opened in 1880, and a dock further west, St Andrew's Dock, opened in 1883. In 1885, a new eastern dock was built, Alexandra Dock, connected to a new railway line constructed by the same company, the [[Hull Barnsley & West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company]]. In 1914, King George Dock was built jointly by the competing railway companies, the Hull and Barnsley company and the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]]; this was extended in 1969 by the Queen Elizabeth Dock extension. As of 2016 Alexandra is being modernised for use in wind farm construction, with a factory, and estuary side quay under construction, a development known as Green Port Hull.\n\nThe Town Docks, Victoria Dock, and St Andrew's Dock fell out of use by the 1970s and were closed, some later infilled and redeveloped, with the Humber and Railway docks converted for leisure craft as [[Hull Marina]].\n\nOther facilities at the port included the Riverside Quay, built on the Humber banks at Albert Dock for passenger ferries and European trains, and the Corporation Pier, from which a [[Humber Ferry]] sailed to [[New Holland, Lincolnshire]]. Numerous industrial works were served by the River Hull, which also hosted a number of dry docks. To the east of Hull, [[Salt End]] near [[Hedon]] became a petroleum distribution point in the 20th&nbsp;century, with piers into the estuary for shipment, and later developed as a chemical works.\n\nAs of 2010, the main port is operated by [[Associated British Ports Holdings|Associated British Ports]] and is estimated to handle one million passengers per year; it is the main softwood timber importation port for the UK.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.abports.co.uk/custinfo/ports/hull.htm |archivedate = 16 July 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716170337/http://www.abports.co.uk/custinfo/ports/hull.htm| title = Port of Hull| publisher = Associated British Ports |accessdate = 19 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{anchor|The Haven}}{{anchor|The Old Harbour}}\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Hull.jpg|thumb|A 17th&nbsp;century map by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]] showing position of various [[staithe]]s in the Haven and the [[Fortifications of Kingston upon Hull|fortifications of the City Wall]].]]\nHull lies at a naturally advantageous position for a port, on the north side of the [[Humber Estuary]] to the west of a bend southwards giving rise to (on average) deeper water; and the [[River Hull]] flows out into the Humber at the same point.{{sfn|Lewis|1991|p=158}}<ref group=\"map\">{{Coord|53.738|-0.332|display=inline|type:landmark|name=Confluence of River Hull and Humber Estuary}} Confluence of River Hull and Humber Estuary</ref>\n\nAn important event in the history of Hull as a port was its acquisition by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]].

The site for the proposed dock was on the Humber foreshore to the west of the River Hull. The Dock Company then proposed a larger dock at the same position, which was sanctioned by an Act of Parliament in 1861{{#tag:ref|One clause of the Hull Docks Act of 1861 was that the Dock Company could be converted to a municipally owned dock trust by the Hull Corporation, additionally the dividends paid by the company were restricted: the Dock Company had been created as a private \"for profit\" company, and was subject to widespread prejudice in the town of Hull that it better served the interests of the shareholders rather than the port itself; the shareholders were characterised as being uninterested in the development of the port.<ref name=\"hh3\"/>|group=\"note\"}}<ref name=\"hh4\">{{harvnb|Sheahan|1864|pp=293\u2013295}}</ref> This dock was known as the Western Dock until its opening in 1869 when it was named Albert Dock; an extension William Wright Dock was opened 1880.<ref name=\"hh3\">{{harvnb|Allison|1969|loc= [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66776#s8 \"The Corporation and the Dock Company, 1835\u201370\"]}}</ref> A third dock (St Andrew's Dock) on the Humber foreshore west of the William Wright Dock was opened in 1883.<ref name=\"ner1\"/> All three docks where ideally suited for trans-shipment by rail as they were directly south of and parallel with the [[Hull and Selby Railway|Selby to Hull railway line]] that terminated in the centre of Hull.\n\nIn 1885, Alexandra Dock opened, which was owned and operated by the [[Hull Barnsley & West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company]]. This ended the Dock Company's monopoly on dock facilities in Hull and led to price cutting competition between the two companies for dock charges; the Dock Company was operating at a loss and from 1886 sought to merge the company into a larger organisation \u2013 the obvious choice being the North Eastern Railway.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|pp=707\u2013708}} In 1891 the Dock Company approached the North Eastern for capital to improve its Albert Dock, leading to the North Eastern Railway acquiring the shares and debts of the Dock Company in exchange for its shares. Instead of improving the Albert Dock, the North Eastern decided to expend a much greater sum on a new dock, east of the Alexandra Dock; however the proposal was opposed by both the Hull and Barnsley, and the Hull Corporation. The Dock Company and NER were legally amalgamated in 1893; one of the clauses of the Act of Parliament allowing the merger stipulated that about \u00a3500,000 would be spent on dock improvements over the next seven years.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|pp=711\u2013715}}\n\nClauses in the 1893 amalgamation bill protecting the Hull and Barnsley company prevented the NER from creating a new deep water dock without consulting the H&BR. This led to a joint proposal for a dock east of Alexandra Dock being submitted, and passed in 1899, as the \"Hull Joint Dock Act\".{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|pp=716\u2013721}} The new dock was opened in 1914 as the King George Dock.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|p=767}}\n\n===Dock ownership (1922\u2013)===\nThe Hull and Barnsley Railway became part of the North Eastern Railway in 1922,<ref name=\"gd\">{{harvnb|Parkes|1970|p=6}}</ref> making the docks in Hull the responsibility of a single company once again.

In 1962 the [[British Transport Docks Board]] was formed by the [[Transport Act 1962]]. In 1981 the company was privatised by the [[Transport Act 1981]], and [[Associated British Ports]] was formed.

It was not until the later 1760s until the [[Hull Corporation]] acted and employed surveyors to search for a suitable site for a new harbour; at the same time the [[HM Customs|Customs]] sought an end to the need to inspect cargoes handled at the private wharves, and so wished to have the customs procedures incorporated into a new dock or wharf \u2013 a \"legal quay\".{{sfn|Baldwin|1973|pp=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Timperley|1836|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAn initial survey by [[Robert Mylne (architect)|Robert Mylne]] and [[Joseph Robson]] recommended a new harbour on the east side of the River Hull. Though the established development on the east bank tended to preclude a new port there, the same interests were unwilling to see the focus of trade shift away from the west bank where they were already established. In the early 1770s, [[John Grundy, Jr.|John Grundy]] was contracted by agriculturalists owning land reliant on the drainage of the River Hull to assess the impact of the proposed new quay on the River Hull. Grundy's report of 1772 suggested either widening the river; or using the channel behind the [[Hull Citadel]], or the moat of the [[Hull town walls]] for both harbourage and drainage \u2013 Grundy also proposed the use of gates in the channel to afford both wet and dry docks.{{sfn|Baldwin|1973|pp=2\u20133}} Reports were prepared on the cost ([[John Wooler (engineer)|John Wooler]]) and effect on the river ([[John Smeaton]]) of Grundy's proposal for a quay on the site of the town's moat. The dock was costed at between \u00a355,000 and \u00a360,000, and the quay between \u00a311,000 and \u00a312,000; while Smeaton's report indicated no issues with arising in terms of the flow of the river. After both reports had been given in early 1773 the Corporation and Customs soon reached agreement to proceed with the plan. With limited opposition only on the grounds of effect on drainage an act for the construction was obtained in 1774.{{sfn|Baldwin|1973|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nThe Old Dock, the first dock in Hull, was built between 1775 and 1778 to a design by [[Henry Berry]] and [[John Grundy, Jr.|John Grundy]]; [[Luke Holt]] acted as resident engineer, appointed on [[John Smeaton]]'s recommendation.<ref>Sources:\n*{{harvnb|Baldwin|1973|p=4}}\n*{{cite book|title = Port and harbour engineering| publisher = Ashgate| first = Adrian| last = Jarvis| year = 1998| page = 162|work = Studies in the history of civil engineering| number  =6| oclc = 237318455}}\n*{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Offfz1NSDt0C| title = Civil Engineering Heritage: Eastern and Central England| first = E.A.|last =  Labrum|publisher = Thomas Telford| year =  1994|isbn = 07277-1970-X|chapter = 2.

[[Humberside Fire and Rescue Service]] had initially warned nearby residents to close doors and windows as a precautionary measure, after a tank containing 580 tonnes of [[hydrochloric acid]] sprang a leak at the dock late in the day. By the early hours of 19 September 2017, firefighters confirmed that wind was blowing the vapour away from houses near the United Molasses site, where the leak occurred, and declared the area near the dock safe.\n\nHowever, within 24 hours emergency crews had returned to the site following a change in wind direction, and a number of emergency service vehicles, including an ambulance, could be seen waiting on standby nearby. The acid was later transferred on to tankers to be taken away safely. Eight people reported signs of feeling unwell as a result of the incident. Four were assessed at the scene and discharged immediately and four were taken to hospital for further assessment. All were ultimately discharged after showing no further symptoms.

The scholar Fredrick F. Anscombe shows that Prizren and [[Vu\u010ditrn]] (''Vul\u00e7itrin'') had no Serbian population in early 17th century. Prizren was inhabited by a mix of Catholic and Muslim Albanians, while Vu\u010ditrn had a mix of Albanian and Turkish speakers, followed by tiny a Serbian minority. [[Gjakova]] was founded by Albanians in the 16th century, and [[Pe\u0107]] (''\u0130pek'') had a continuous presence of the Albanian Kelmendi tribe. Central Kosovo was mixed, but large parts of the [[Drenica|Drenica Valley]] were ethnically Albanian.

[[Language policy]] was of utmost importance in communist Yugoslavia, which after World War II was reorganized as a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation of ethnolinguistically defined nations]], in emulation of the [[Korenizatsiya|interwar Soviet nationalities policy]]. For instance, in 1944, the [[Macedonian language]] was proclaimed for the sake of distancing former [[Vardar Banovina]], which was [[World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia|incorporated into wartime Bulgaria]], from [[Bulgarian language]] and culture. Likewise, in postwar Yugoslavia's [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], the local [[Albanian language]] was distanced from Albania's standard steeped in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], by basing it on the Kosovar dialect of [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]. As a result, a standard Kosovar language was formed. However, after the rapprochement between Albania and Yugoslavia at the turn of the 1970s, Belgrade adopted Albania's Tosk-based standard of the Albanian language, which ended the brief flourishing of the Gheg-based Kosovar language.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/29940833/The_Idea_of_a_Kosovan_Language_in_Yugoslavia_s_Language_Politics_pp_217-237_._International_Journal_of_the_Sociology_of_Language._Vol_242._DOI_10.1515_ijsl-2016-0040 Tomasz Kamusella. 2016.

The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.\n\nThe [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.\nThe declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.\n{{Clear}}\n=== Minorities ===\n\nThe relations between [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanians]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Kosovar Serbs]] have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Schabnel, Albrecht 2001.

Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved.

The scholar Fredrick F. Anscombe shows that Prizren and [[Vu\u010ditrn]] (''Vul\u00e7itrin'') had no Serbian population in early 17th century. Prizren was inhabited by a mix of Catholic and Muslim Albanians, while Vu\u010ditrn had a mix of Albanian and Turkish speakers, followed by tiny a Serbian minority. [[Gjakova]] was founded by Albanians in the 16th century, and [[Pe\u0107]] (''\u0130pek'') had a continuous presence of the Albanian Kelmendi tribe. Central Kosovo was mixed, but large parts of the [[Drenica|Drenica Valley]] were ethnically Albanian.

[[Language policy]] was of utmost importance in communist Yugoslavia, which after World War II was reorganized as a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation of ethnolinguistically defined nations]], in emulation of the [[Korenizatsiya|interwar Soviet nationalities policy]]. For instance, in 1944, the [[Macedonian language]] was proclaimed for the sake of distancing former [[Vardar Banovina]], which was [[World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia|incorporated into wartime Bulgaria]], from [[Bulgarian language]] and culture. Likewise, in postwar Yugoslavia's [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], the local [[Albanian language]] was distanced from Albania's standard steeped in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], by basing it on the Kosovar dialect of [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]. As a result, a standard Kosovar language was formed. However, after the rapprochement between Albania and Yugoslavia at the turn of the 1970s, Belgrade adopted Albania's Tosk-based standard of the Albanian language, which ended the brief flourishing of the Gheg-based Kosovar language.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/29940833/The_Idea_of_a_Kosovan_Language_in_Yugoslavia_s_Language_Politics_pp_217-237_._International_Journal_of_the_Sociology_of_Language._Vol_242._DOI_10.1515_ijsl-2016-0040 Tomasz Kamusella. 2016.

As of the [[Constitution of Kosovo]], the judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial authority, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and an independent prosecutorial institution. All of them are administered by the [[Kosovo Judicial Council|Judicial Council]] located in [[Pristina]]. The [[Kosovo Police]] is the main state law enforcement agency in the nation. After the Independence of Kosovo in 2008, the force became the governmental agency. The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.\n\nThe [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.\nThe declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.\n{{Clear}}\n=== Minorities ===\n\nThe relations between [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanians]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Kosovar Serbs]] have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Schabnel, Albrecht 2001.

Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved.

As was the custom in those days the regiment was named '''Huntingdon's Regiment''' after its Colonel. As Colonel succeeded Colonel the name changed, but in 1751 regiments were given numbers, and the regiment was from that time officially known as the '''33rd Regiment of Foot'''. In 1782 the regiment's title was changed to the '''33rd (or First Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment''', thus formalising an association with the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] which, even then, had been long established. The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|first Duke of Wellington]] died in 1852 and in the following year [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], in recognition of the regiment's long ties to him, ordered that the regiment's title be changed to the '''33rd (or The Duke of Wellington's) Regiment'''. In 1881, following the [[Childers Reforms]], the 33rd was linked with the [[76th Regiment of Foot]], who shared their depot in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. The 76th had first been raised in 1745, by [[Simon Harcourt, 1st Earl Harcourt|Simon Harcourt]] and disbanded in 1746, re-raised in 1756 disbanded again in 1763, before being raised again in 1777, disbanded in 1784 and finally re-raised, in 1787, for service in India, by the [[East India Company|Honorable East India Company]].<ref>The Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) A Short History, by Major ACS Savoury MBE and Major General DE Isles CB OBE DL, (Page 4), printed By Reuben Holroyd's, Halifax, 19878</ref><ref>The History of The Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) 1702\u20131992, By JM Brereton AND Major ACS Savoury MBE, {{ISBN|0-9521552-0-6}}, Published by The Duke of Wellingtons Regiment Regimental Headquarters</ref> The two regiments became, respectively, the 1st and 2nd battalions of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment. In 1948 the 1st and 2nd battalions were amalgamated into a single battalion, the 1st Battalion. On 6 June 2006 the 'Dukes' were amalgamated with the [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and the [[Green Howards]] to form the [[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]. As the youngest regiment, the 'Dukes' became the 3rd Battalion, as each battalion retained their antecedent regiment's name in brackets. Following further mergers, in 2012, the battalion was redesignated as the new 1st Battalion (1 Yorks) of the regiment. At this point, the antecedent regimental names were dropped from the battalion titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/26215.aspx#|title=Yorkshire Regiment regimental history|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nBattalions from the regiment had served in most land conflicts involving British forces since its formation, from the Wars of the [[War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian]] and [[War of the Spanish Succession|Spanish]] successions, through the [[American Revolutionary War|American war of Independence]] and various campaigns in India and Africa, the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Second Boer War]] and many of the greatest battles of the [[World War I|First World War]] (the [[Battle of Mons]], the [[Battle of the Somme]], the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]]) and the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the regiment fought as part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] in [[France]], forming part of the rearguard at [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]]; in [[North Africa]]; [[Italy]] and in [[France]], following the [[D-Day]] landings, and as [[Chindits]] in [[Burma]]. In [[Korean War|Korea]], the 'Dukes' desperate defence of the [[Battle of the Hook|Hook]] position halted the last major Chinese attempt to break the United Nations Line before the truce, in July 1953, brought the war to an end. In Cyprus the battalion was successful in Operation Golden Rain, destroying a major [[EOKA]] terrorist group operating in the Troodos Mountains in 1956.

The third Battle of the Hook began on 28 May. An initial bombardment of the British positions took place, with the Chinese forces charging the forward British positions once the bombardment ceased. The fighting that ensued was bloody and more akin to the battles that the 'Dukes' had fought in the First World War. Shells were now raining down on the Hook from artillery and mortars, from both the Chinese and [[United Nations|UN]] forces. The Chinese launched a second attack but were cut down by heavy fire from the UN forces. Further attacks occurred on 28 May, but all were defeated in heavy fighting. Just 30 minutes into 29 May, the Chinese forces launched another attack but, as before, they were beaten back.

The engagement lasted fifteen minutes, with over 2,000 rounds of ammunition being expended by the 'Dukes'. Seven of the Bosnian-Serb soldiers were killed in the fire-fight.

This continued to be the case with the scarlet tunic worn by all ranks in full dress until 1914 and by bandsmen until amalgamation (see illustrations above). Officers were distinguished by silver buttons and braid until 1830 and thereafter by gold, After 1893 the badge of the Duke of Wellington was worn.<ref>W.Y.Carman, page 61 \"Uniforms of the British Army \u2014 the Infantry Regiments\", {{ISBN|0-86350-031-5}},</ref>\n\n==Alliances==\n[[File:Affiliation Plaque, LVQ-DWR.jpg|thumb|right|DWR & les Voltigeurs de Qu\u00e9bec Regimental affiliation plague]]\n*[[les Voltigeurs de Qu\u00e9bec]], [[Canada]]\n*10th Battalion, The [[Baloch Regiment]], [[Pakistan]]\n*[[HMS Iron Duke (F234)|HMS ''Iron Duke'']], [[Royal Navy]]\n\n==Victoria Cross recipients==\nVictoria Cross recipients have been:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwr.org.uk/dwr.php?id=55|title=Victoria Cross recipients|publisher=Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) Regimental Association|accessdate=20 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203080152/http://www.dwr.org.uk/dwr.php?id=55|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n*[[Drummer]] [[Michael Magner]]\n*[[Private (rank)|Private]] [[James Bergin]]\n*[[Sergeant]] [[James Firth]]\n*[[Second Lieutenant]] [[James Palmer Huffam]]\n*Second Lieutenant [[Henry Kelly (VC)|Henry Kelly]]\n*Private [[Arnold Loosemore]]\n*Private [[Arthur Poulter]]\n*Private [[Richard Henry Burton]]\n*Private [[Henry Tandey]] was awarded his VC for actions during his service with the 'Dukes' and donated his medals to the Regimental Museum in Halifax, West Yorkshire.

[[British Army]], forming part of the [[King's Division]].\n\nIn 1702 Colonel [[George Hastings, 8th Earl of Huntingdon]], was authorised to raise a new regiment, which he did in and around the city of [[Gloucester]]. As was the custom in those days the regiment was named '''Huntingdon's Regiment''' after its Colonel. As Colonel succeeded Colonel the name changed, but in 1751 regiments were given numbers, and the regiment was from that time officially known as the '''33rd Regiment of Foot'''. In 1782 the regiment's title was changed to the '''33rd (or First Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment''', thus formalising an association with the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] which, even then, had been long established. The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|first Duke of Wellington]] died in 1852 and in the following year [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], in recognition of the regiment's long ties to him, ordered that the regiment's title be changed to the '''33rd (or The Duke of Wellington's) Regiment'''. In 1881, following the [[Childers Reforms]], the 33rd was linked with the [[76th Regiment of Foot]], who shared their depot in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. The 76th had first been raised in 1745, by [[Simon Harcourt, 1st Earl Harcourt|Simon Harcourt]] and disbanded in 1746, re-raised in 1756 disbanded again in 1763, before being raised again in 1777, disbanded in 1784 and finally re-raised, in 1787, for service in India, by the [[East India Company|Honorable East India Company]].<ref>The Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) A Short History, by Major ACS Savoury MBE and Major General DE Isles CB OBE DL, (Page 4), printed By Reuben Holroyd's, Halifax, 19878</ref><ref>The History of The Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) 1702\u20131992, By JM Brereton AND Major ACS Savoury MBE, {{ISBN|0-9521552-0-6}}, Published by The Duke of Wellingtons Regiment Regimental Headquarters</ref> The two regiments became, respectively, the 1st and 2nd battalions of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment. In 1948 the 1st and 2nd battalions were amalgamated into a single battalion, the 1st Battalion. On 6 June 2006 the 'Dukes' were amalgamated with the [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and the [[Green Howards]] to form the [[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]. As the youngest regiment, the 'Dukes' became the 3rd Battalion, as each battalion retained their antecedent regiment's name in brackets. Following further mergers, in 2012, the battalion was redesignated as the new 1st Battalion (1 Yorks) of the regiment. At this point, the antecedent regimental names were dropped from the battalion titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/26215.aspx#|title=Yorkshire Regiment regimental history|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nBattalions from the regiment had served in most land conflicts involving British forces since its formation, from the Wars of the [[War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian]] and [[War of the Spanish Succession|Spanish]] successions, through the [[American Revolutionary War|American war of Independence]] and various campaigns in India and Africa, the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Second Boer War]] and many of the greatest battles of the [[World War I|First World War]] (the [[Battle of Mons]], the [[Battle of the Somme]], the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]]) and the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the regiment fought as part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] in [[France]], forming part of the rearguard at [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]]; in [[North Africa]]; [[Italy]] and in [[France]], following the [[D-Day]] landings, and as [[Chindits]] in [[Burma]]. In [[Korean War|Korea]], the 'Dukes' desperate defence of the [[Battle of the Hook|Hook]] position halted the last major Chinese attempt to break the United Nations Line before the truce, in July 1953, brought the war to an end. In Cyprus the battalion was successful in Operation Golden Rain, destroying a major [[EOKA]] terrorist group operating in the Troodos Mountains in 1956. In 1964 the battalion joined the [[NATO]] deterrence in Germany on the front line in the [[Cold War]] and from 1971 was regularly engaged in '[[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] until 1997. They were amongst the first units to cross the border from [[Kuwait]] in the 2003 [[Iraq War]].\n\nNine soldiers from the regiment have been awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], and Corporal [[Wayne Mills (British Army soldier)|Wayne Mills]] of the 1st Battalion became the first recipient of the [[Conspicuous Gallantry Cross]] in 1994, whilst serving with the [[United Nations]] forces in [[Bosnia]].\n\n==Formation and name==\n[[File:DWR 33rd Badge (RLH).jpg|90px|left|33rd Regiment Insignia]]\n\n'''The Duke of Wellington's Regiment''' was originally formed in 1702 as '''Huntingdon's Regiment'''.

It was disbanded on 25 March 1714, but was officially registered as the '''33rd Regiment of Foot''' in January 1715 and re-raised on 25 March 1715, as '''George Wade's Regiment'''; then '''Henry Hawley's Regiment'''; '''Robert Dalzell's Regiment''' and '''John Johnson's Regiment'''.<ref name=brief-history>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwr.org.uk/the_regiment/brief-history/|title=Brief History and Titles of the Regiment|publisher=Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) Regimental Association|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1782 Lord Cornwallis, the then Colonel of the Regiment, wrote that \"The 33rd Regiment of Infantry has always recruited in the West Riding of Yorkshire and has a very good interest and the general goodwill of the people in that part of the country:-   I should therefore wish not only to be permitted to recruit in that county, but that my Regiment may bear the name of the 33rd or West Yorkshire Regiment\".

Following the loss of [[Menorca]], to the French, it was reraised in November 1756 as the '''61st Regiment''', but renumbered to 76th, by General Order in 1758, and again disbanded in 1763. A second battalion raised by that regiment in October 1758, for service in Africa, was renumbered as the 86th Regiment<!--- Editors Note: do not disambiguate this 86th Regiment to the Rutland Regiment, which was raised 16 years later --->  and also disbanded in 1763. On 25 December 1777, the 76th was again re-raised, as the '''76th Regiment of Foot (Macdonald's Highlanders)''', by Colonel John MacDonell of Lochgarry, in the West of Scotland and Western Isles, as a Scottish Light Infantry regiment. It was disbanded at [[Stirling Castle]] in March 1784.

General [[Charles William Dunbar Staveley|Staveley]] was not happy at any further delay and ordered the 33rd to continue the attack. Several officers and the men of the 33rd Regiment, along with an officer from the Royal Engineers, parted from the main force and, after climbing the cliff face, found their way blocked by a thorny hedge over a wall. Private [[James Bergin]], a very tall man, used his bayonet to cut a hole in the hedge and Drummer [[Michael Magner]] climbed onto his shoulders through the hedge in the gap and dragged Bergin up behind him as Ensign Conner and Corporal Murphy helped shove from below.  Bergin kept up a rapid rate of fire on the Koket-Bir as Magner dragged more men through the gap in the hedge. As more men poured through and opened fire as they advanced with their bayonets the defenders withdrew through the second gate. The party rushed the Koket-bir before it was fully closed and then took the second gate breaking through to the Amba. Ensign Wynter scrambled up onto the top of the second gate and fixed the 33rd Regiments Colours to show the Plateau had been taken.

Finally, in 1961, the rest of 382 Rgt converted to infantry and merged with the 5/7th Bn, bringing together all four Territorial battalions of the regiment as the '''West Riding Battalion''', which in 1967 became part of the [[Yorkshire Volunteers]].<ref name = Regts7/><ref name = Regts5/><ref name=\"Litchfield\"/><ref name = Regts4/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-no/yw-dwr6.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227055847/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-no/yw-dwr6.htm|title=6th Battalion, The Duke of Wellington's Regiment [UK]|archivedate=27 December 2005|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-no/yw-dwr3.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103181604/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-no/yw-dwr3.htm|title=3rd Bn, The Duke of Wellington's Regiment [UK]|archivedate=3 January 2006|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-no/67york1.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230140734/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-no/67york1.htm|title=Yorkshire Volunteers [UK]|archivedate=30 December 2005|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/372-413-regiments.html|title=British Army units from 1945 on|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/564-591-regiments.html |title=British Army units from 1945 on |accessdate=10 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110025402/http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/564-591-regiments.html |archivedate=10 January 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/638-677-regiments.html|title=British Army units from 1945 on|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Korean War (1952\u20131956)==\nThe 1st Battalion was deployed to [[Korea]] in 1952, two years after the [[Korean War]] had broken out.

The third Battle of the Hook began on 28 May. An initial bombardment of the British positions took place, with the Chinese forces charging the forward British positions once the bombardment ceased. The fighting that ensued was bloody and more akin to the battles that the 'Dukes' had fought in the First World War. Shells were now raining down on the Hook from artillery and mortars, from both the Chinese and [[United Nations|UN]] forces. The Chinese launched a second attack but were cut down by heavy fire from the UN forces. Further attacks occurred on 28 May, but all were defeated in heavy fighting. Just 30 minutes into 29 May, the Chinese forces launched another attack but, as before, they were beaten back. Alma Company of 'The 'Dukes' then began advancing up the line of the original trenches to dislodge the remaining Chinese forces in the forward trenches. The 'Dukes' secured the Hook at 3:30&nbsp;a.m. The 'Dukes' losses were three officers and 17 other ranks killed and two officers and 84 other ranks wounded, plus 20 other ranks missing.<ref name=\"Korean War Battle of The Hook\">The Korean War, Page 336. {{cite book |author1=Brereton, JM |author2=Savory, ACS | title=The History of the Duke of Wellingtons (West Riding) 1702\u20131992| publisher=Halifax : The Duke of Wellington's Regiment|year=1993 |isbn=0-9521552-0-6}}</ref>\n\nThe 'Dukes' embarked for [[Gibraltar]] on 13 November 1953, arriving on 10 December.

While at Gora\u017ede, Private Shaun Taylor of C Company was killed during an engagement with Bosnian-Serb forces while manning an observation post. The engagement lasted fifteen minutes, with over 2,000 rounds of ammunition being expended by the 'Dukes'. Seven of the Bosnian-Serb soldiers were killed in the fire-fight. Gora\u017ede remained a safe zone, being held by British troops from 1994 to 1995.
