Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as commercially, rather than creativity inspired.<ref>''Artists, Advertising, and the Borders of Art'' by Bogart, 1995 pp. 1-3, 47-55, 78. Their stature was just slightly above, that of the advertising artists. The majority lacked job security.</ref> Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s.

There was a nostalgic element to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection.

This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY metro area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic.

These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY metro area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

The Saragarhi post, situated on a rocky ridge, consisted of a small block house with loop-holed ramparts and a signalling tower.\n\nA general uprising by the Afghans began there in 1897, and between 27 August and 11 September many vigorous efforts by Pashtuns to capture the forts were thwarted by the 36th Sikhs. In 1897, insurgent and inimical activities had increased, and on 3 and 9 September [[Afridi]] tribesmen, allied with the Afghans, attacked Fort Gulistan. Both the attacks were repulsed, and a relief column from Fort Lockhart, on its return trip, reinforced the signalling detachment positioned at Saragarhi, increasing its strength to three [[non-commissioned officers]] (NCOs) and eighteen [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]] (ORs).\n\n==The battle==\n[[File:Sikh Regt Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sikh soldiers, c. 1890]]\nDetails of the Battle of Saragarhi are considered fairly accurate, because Gurmukh Singh signalled events to Fort Lockhart by [[heliograph]]<ref name=1908NZStar>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65010542 |title=Defense of Saragarhi PosT|newspaper=[[The Camperdown Chronicle|Camperdown Chronicle (Vic. : 1877\u20131954)]] |location= |date=5 December 1907 |accessdate=1 September 2014 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> as they occurred.<ref name=\"pall\"/>\n* Around 09:00, approximately 6,000\u201310,000 Afghans reach the signalling post at Saragarhi.\n* [[Sepoy]] Gurmukh Singh signals to Colonel Haughton, situated in Fort Lockhart, that they are under attack.\n* Haughton states he cannot send immediate help to Saragarhi.\n* The soldiers in Saragarhi decide to fight to the last to prevent the enemy from reaching the forts.\n* Sepoy Bhagwan Singh is the first soldier to be killed and [[Naik (military rank)|Naik]] Lal Singh is seriously wounded.\n* Naik Lal Singh and Sepoy Jiwa Singh reportedly carry the body of Bhagwan Singh back to the inner layer of the post.\n* The Afghans break a portion of the wall of the picket.\n* Haughton signals that he has estimated that there are between 10,000 and 14,000 Pashtuns attacking Saragarhi.\n* The leaders of the Pashtun forces reportedly make promises to the soldiers to entice them to surrender.\n* Reportedly two determined attempts are made to rush open the gate, but are unsuccessful.\n* Later, the wall is breached.\n* Thereafter, some of the fiercest hand-to-hand fighting occurs.\n* In an act of outstanding bravery, Havildar Ishar Singh orders his men to fall back into the inner layer, whilst he remains to fight. However, this is breached and all but one of the defending soldiers are killed, along with many of the Pashtuns.\n* Sepoy Gurmukh Singh, who communicated the battle to Haughton, was the last surviving Sikh defender. He is stated to have killed 20 Afghans, the Pashtuns having to set fire to the post to kill him. As he was dying, he was said to have yelled repeatedly the Sikh battle cry \"[[Bole So Nihal]], [[Sat Sri Akal]]!\" (\"One will be blessed eternally, who says that God is the ultimate truth!\").\n\nHaving destroyed Saragarhi, the Afghans turned their attention to Fort Gulistan, but they had been delayed too long, and reinforcements arrived there in the night of 13\u201314 September, before the fort could be captured.<ref name=\"londongaz\"/> The Pashtuns later admitted that they had lost about 180 killed<ref name=\"ioss\">Major General Jaswant Singh [http://www.sikhstudies.org/Periodicals.asp?TtlCod=471 Letter to H.M.

They want it taught due to the heroism shown by the Indian soldiers to act as inspiration for young children.

Following this, the State Government had issued a notification that the battle story should be included in the school curriculum from this session. There had been a constant demand from the Sikh Regiment and various ex-servicemen's associations that the battle be included in the school curriculum. A similar request had also been put forward to Mr Badal during the battle's state-level centenary celebrations at Ferozepore in 1997. A subsequent letter sent to the Punjab Government by the Saragarhi Memorial and Ethos Promotion Forum had also urged the State Government that the battle has many inspiring lessons for children.

Thus a series of forts, originally built by [[Ranjit Singh]], the ruler of the [[Sikh Empire]], were consolidated. Two of the forts were Fort Lockhart (on the Samana Range of the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains), and Fort Gulistan ([[Sulaiman Range]]), situated a few miles apart. Fort Lockhart is located at 33.5562N 70.9188E.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-3831266&fid=4661&c=pakistan|title=Fort Lockhart Geo Location|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Due to the forts not being visible to each other, Saragarhi was created midway, as a [[heliograph]]ic communication post. The Saragarhi post, situated on a rocky ridge, consisted of a small block house with loop-holed ramparts and a signalling tower.\n\nA general uprising by the Afghans began there in 1897, and between 27 August and 11 September many vigorous efforts by Pashtuns to capture the forts were thwarted by the 36th Sikhs. In 1897, insurgent and inimical activities had increased, and on 3 and 9 September [[Afridi]] tribesmen, allied with the Afghans, attacked Fort Gulistan. Both the attacks were repulsed, and a relief column from Fort Lockhart, on its return trip, reinforced the signalling detachment positioned at Saragarhi, increasing its strength to three [[non-commissioned officers]] (NCOs) and eighteen [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]] (ORs).\n\n==The battle==\n[[File:Sikh Regt Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sikh soldiers, c. 1890]]\nDetails of the Battle of Saragarhi are considered fairly accurate, because Gurmukh Singh signalled events to Fort Lockhart by [[heliograph]]<ref name=1908NZStar>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65010542 |title=Defense of Saragarhi PosT|newspaper=[[The Camperdown Chronicle|Camperdown Chronicle (Vic. : 1877\u20131954)]] |location= |date=5 December 1907 |accessdate=1 September 2014 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> as they occurred.<ref name=\"pall\"/>\n* Around 09:00, approximately 6,000\u201310,000 Afghans reach the signalling post at Saragarhi.\n* [[Sepoy]] Gurmukh Singh signals to Colonel Haughton, situated in Fort Lockhart, that they are under attack.\n* Haughton states he cannot send immediate help to Saragarhi.\n* The soldiers in Saragarhi decide to fight to the last to prevent the enemy from reaching the forts.\n* Sepoy Bhagwan Singh is the first soldier to be killed and [[Naik (military rank)|Naik]] Lal Singh is seriously wounded.\n* Naik Lal Singh and Sepoy Jiwa Singh reportedly carry the body of Bhagwan Singh back to the inner layer of the post.\n* The Afghans break a portion of the wall of the picket.\n* Haughton signals that he has estimated that there are between 10,000 and 14,000 Pashtuns attacking Saragarhi.\n* The leaders of the Pashtun forces reportedly make promises to the soldiers to entice them to surrender.\n* Reportedly two determined attempts are made to rush open the gate, but are unsuccessful.\n* Later, the wall is breached.\n* Thereafter, some of the fiercest hand-to-hand fighting occurs.\n* In an act of outstanding bravery, Havildar Ishar Singh orders his men to fall back into the inner layer, whilst he remains to fight. However, this is breached and all but one of the defending soldiers are killed, along with many of the Pashtuns.\n* Sepoy Gurmukh Singh, who communicated the battle to Haughton, was the last surviving Sikh defender. He is stated to have killed 20 Afghans, the Pashtuns having to set fire to the post to kill him.

A similar request had also been put forward to Mr Badal during the battle's state-level centenary celebrations at Ferozepore in 1997. A subsequent letter sent to the Punjab Government by the Saragarhi Memorial and Ethos Promotion Forum had also urged the State Government that the battle has many inspiring lessons for children.

It was produced by [[Dinesh Vijan]] and [[Bhushan Kumar]] under their respective banners [[Maddock Films]] and [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]]. The film features [[Irrfan Khan]] and [[Saba Qamar]] in the lead roles, with [[Deepak Dobriyal]] and Dishita Sehgal in supporting roles. Set in Delhi, the plot centres on a couple's struggle to get their daughter admitted to a prestigious [[English-medium education|English-medium]] school in order to rise in society.\n\nThe idea for the film was created by Chaudhary and his co-writer Zeenat Lakhani during the development of his previous film ''[[Shaadi Ke Side Effects]]'' (2014). The film was shot in [[Chandni Chowk]], [[Anand Lok, Jaipur|Anand Lok]], [[Karol Bagh]], and Sangam Vihar. The film's [[soundtrack album]] was composed by the duo [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], with lyrics by [[Priya Saraiya]] and [[Kumaar]]. The [[Film score|score]] was composed by [[Amar Mohile]]. [[Laxman Utekar]] was the [[Cinematography|cinematographer]], and [[A. Sreekar Prasad]] edited the film.\n\nMade on a [[production budget]] of {{\u20b9|14|link=yes}} [[crore]], ''Hindi Medium'' released on 19 May 2017, and received a generally positive reception from the critics, with particular praise for Khan's and Qamar's performances. The film grossed {{INRConvert|322.4|c}} at the worldwide box office, with a large amount coming from China, becoming one of the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films]] of all time. At the [[63rd Filmfare Awards]], it won [[Filmfare Award for Best Film|Best Film]], and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Khan. Due to the success of the film, a spiritual successor, ''[[Angrezi Medium]]'', directed by [[Homi Adajania]], went into development, and was released theatrically on 13 March 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nRaj Batra ([[Irrfan Khan]]) is a boutique owner who lives in [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place, Delhi]], with his wife Mita ([[Saba Qamar]]) and 5-year-old daughter, Pia (Dishita Sehgal). The couple want Pia to be admitted to a prestigious English-medium school in Delhi as they feel that this will enable her to become a part of the elite of society. After browsing through some luxurious hotel-like schools, they zero in on the Delhi Grammar School, ranked the best in the city, but it stipulates that students must stay within a 3-km radius of the school. \n\nThey move to a posh villa in Delhi's upscale [[Vasant Vihar, Delhi|Vasant Vihar]] neighbourhood and try to befriend the neighbours, but face limited success as their (particularly Raj's) gaucheness holds them back. They are introduced to a consultant, Shikha ([[Tillotama Shome]]), who is largely cynical and disparaging of the couple for their flashiness, but nevertheless helps them to prepare for the interview required for admission to various top schools. However, Raj and Mita fail to deliver their tutored answers in the interview, and their application gets rejected due to their limited knowledge of English. \n\nRaj and Mita learn from an employee that his daughter has been admitted through the [[Right to education|Right To Education]] (RTE) quota, a scheme that helps children from poor families to be admitted to prestigious schools. Through a fixer, Raj gets fake certificates and proofs of an address in Bharat Nagar, a slum area of the city. They decide to apply for Pia's admission through that scheme. However, a scam soon surfaces in which it is revealed that rich parents pose as paupers to get their children admitted through the RTE quota. So, after telling their snooty neighbours that they are going on a Europe trip, the Batras move to a dilapidated home in Bharat Nagar for a month and pretend to be impoverished. They strike a friendship with Shyam ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]) and Tulsi (Swati Das), who are hopeful that their son Mohan (Angshuman Nandi) gets to study in Delhi Grammar School through the RTE quota.\n\nWhen school officials come to Bharat Nagar to investigate, they are surprised that the Batras do not seem to be as poor as their appearances would suggest, but Shyam covers up for Raj, saying that they were reduced to penury due to a factory fire. Shyam and Tulsi teach them to live like poor people. Raj accompanies Shyam to work at a food manufacturing plant, while Mita slowly learns to fight for her share of daily needs. The Batras and Shyam's family are hopeful that their children will get admission through random selection; however, while Pia eventually gets admission, Mohan's application is rejected. \n\nThe Batras return to Vasant Vihar. Raj and Mita make a donation to the Bharat Nagar Government School, where Mohan studies, to renovate it and get new books. After watching their son become fluent in English, Shyam and Tulsi search for the identity of the anonymous donor to thank them. However, when he visits the donor's address in Vasant Vihar, Shyam is astonished to see Raj. He finds out the truth about Raj pretending to be poor to enable Pia's admission and leaves to tell Delhi Grammar School's principal ([[Amrita Singh]]) of Raj's deceit.\n\nRaj and Mita rush to Delhi Grammar school to get there before Shyam. Raj asks for Pia's admission to be revoked and tells the truth. The principal rejects doing so, and simply asks him to take his seat in the annual day performance in the auditorium. After some children perform a song-and-dance routine, he gatecrashes the function, reveals they are actually from the Bharat Nagar government school, gives a speech about English in India and education rights, and leaves. On their way out, the Batras bump into the principal of the government school and tell him that they plan to admit their daughter Pia to his school to study with Mohan, which he is only too happy to accept.\n\n==Cast==\nCredits adapted from [[Bollywood Hungama]]:<ref name=\"Hindi Medium Cast & Crew\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/hindi-medium/cast/|title=Hindi Medium Cast & Crew|publisher=Bollywood Hungama|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=15 July 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715091657/https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/hindi-medium/cast/?movieid=3526|archivedate=15 July 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Irrfan Khan]] as Raj Batra\n** Delzad Hiwale as young Raj\n* [[Saba Qamar]] as Mita Batra\n** [[Sanjana Sanghi]] as young Mita\n* Kiran Khoje as Sushila\n* Dishita Sehgal as Pia Batra\n* [[Amrita Singh]] as Principal Lodha\n* [[Deepak Dobriyal]] as Shyam Prakash\n* [[Neelu Kohli]] as Mita's mother\n* Rajeev Gupta as Masterji, Raj's father\n* [[Sumit Gulati]] as Chotu\n* [[Mallika Dua]] as Dolly\n* Kulbir Kaur as Dolly's mother\n* Charu Shankar as Maya\n* [[Tillotama Shome]] as Shikha, a consultant\n* [[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]] as MLA\n* [[Taran Bajaj]] as tout\n* [[Ankur Jain]] as news reader\n* Swati Das as Tulsi\n* [[Neha Dhupia]] as Aarti (special appearance)\n* [[Sanjay Suri]] as Kabir (special appearance)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nMade on a production budget of {{\u20b9|14}} crore, ''Hindi Medium'' was produced by Vijan of Maddock Films and Bhushan Kumar of T-Series.

He came up with the idea of making a film about [[Education in India|India's education system]] with his co-writer Zeenat Lakhani during the development of the latter film. They found the idea too extensive to include in ''Shaadi Ke Side Effects'', so after its release, they decided to incorporate the idea into a separate film.

It was produced by [[Dinesh Vijan]] and [[Bhushan Kumar]] under their respective banners [[Maddock Films]] and [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]]. The film features [[Irrfan Khan]] and [[Saba Qamar]] in the lead roles, with [[Deepak Dobriyal]] and Dishita Sehgal in supporting roles. Set in Delhi, the plot centres on a couple's struggle to get their daughter admitted to a prestigious [[English-medium education|English-medium]] school in order to rise in society.\n\nThe idea for the film was created by Chaudhary and his co-writer Zeenat Lakhani during the development of his previous film ''[[Shaadi Ke Side Effects]]'' (2014). The film was shot in [[Chandni Chowk]], [[Anand Lok, Jaipur|Anand Lok]], [[Karol Bagh]], and Sangam Vihar. The film's [[soundtrack album]] was composed by the duo [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], with lyrics by [[Priya Saraiya]] and [[Kumaar]]. The [[Film score|score]] was composed by [[Amar Mohile]]. [[Laxman Utekar]] was the [[Cinematography|cinematographer]], and [[A. Sreekar Prasad]] edited the film.\n\nMade on a [[production budget]] of {{\u20b9|14|link=yes}} [[crore]], ''Hindi Medium'' released on 19 May 2017, and received a generally positive reception from the critics, with particular praise for Khan's and Qamar's performances. The film grossed {{INRConvert|322.4|c}} at the worldwide box office, with a large amount coming from China, becoming one of the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films]] of all time. At the [[63rd Filmfare Awards]], it won [[Filmfare Award for Best Film|Best Film]], and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Khan. Due to the success of the film, a spiritual successor, ''[[Angrezi Medium]]'', directed by [[Homi Adajania]], went into development, and was released theatrically on 13 March 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nRaj Batra ([[Irrfan Khan]]) is a boutique owner who lives in [[Connaught Place, New Delhi|Connaught Place, Delhi]], with his wife Mita ([[Saba Qamar]]) and 5-year-old daughter, Pia (Dishita Sehgal). The couple want Pia to be admitted to a prestigious English-medium school in Delhi as they feel that this will enable her to become a part of the elite of society. After browsing through some luxurious hotel-like schools, they zero in on the Delhi Grammar School, ranked the best in the city, but it stipulates that students must stay within a 3-km radius of the school. \n\nThey move to a posh villa in Delhi's upscale [[Vasant Vihar, Delhi|Vasant Vihar]] neighbourhood and try to befriend the neighbours, but face limited success as their (particularly Raj's) gaucheness holds them back. They are introduced to a consultant, Shikha ([[Tillotama Shome]]), who is largely cynical and disparaging of the couple for their flashiness, but nevertheless helps them to prepare for the interview required for admission to various top schools. However, Raj and Mita fail to deliver their tutored answers in the interview, and their application gets rejected due to their limited knowledge of English. \n\nRaj and Mita learn from an employee that his daughter has been admitted through the [[Right to education|Right To Education]] (RTE) quota, a scheme that helps children from poor families to be admitted to prestigious schools. Through a fixer, Raj gets fake certificates and proofs of an address in Bharat Nagar, a slum area of the city. They decide to apply for Pia's admission through that scheme. However, a scam soon surfaces in which it is revealed that rich parents pose as paupers to get their children admitted through the RTE quota. So, after telling their snooty neighbours that they are going on a Europe trip, the Batras move to a dilapidated home in Bharat Nagar for a month and pretend to be impoverished. They strike a friendship with Shyam ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]) and Tulsi (Swati Das), who are hopeful that their son Mohan (Angshuman Nandi) gets to to study in Delhi Grammar School through the RTE quota.\n\nWhen school officials come to Bharat Nagar to investigate, they are surprised that the Batras do not seem to be as poor as their appearances would suggest, but Shyam covers up for Raj, saying that they were reduced to penury due to a factory fire. Shyam and Tulsi teach them to live like poor people. Raj accompanies Shyam to work at a food manufacturing plant, while Mita slowly learns to fight for her share of daily needs. The Batras and Shyam's family are hopeful that their children will get admission through random selection; however, while Pia eventually gets admission, Mohan's application is rejected. \n\nThe Batras return to Vasant Vihar. Raj and Mita make a donation to the Bharat Nagar Government School, where Mohan studies, to renovate it and get new books. After watching their son become fluent in English, Shyam and Tulsi search for the identity of the anonymous donor to thank them. However, when he visits the donor's address in Vasant Vihar, Shyam is astonished to see Raj. He finds out the truth about Raj pretending to be poor to enable Pia's admission and leaves to tell Delhi Grammar School's principal ([[Amrita Singh]]) of Raj's deceit.\n\nRaj and Mita rush to Delhi Grammar school to get there before Shyam. Raj asks for Pia's admission to be revoked and tells the truth. The principal rejects doing so, and simply asks him to take his seat in the annual day performance in the auditorium. After some children perform a song-and-dance routine, he gatecrashes the function, reveals they are actually from the Bharat Nagar government school, gives a speech about English in India and education rights, and leaves. On their way out, the Batras bump into the principal of the government school and tell him that they plan to admit their daughter Pia to his school to study with Mohan, which he is only too happy to accept.\n\n==Cast==\nCredits adapted from [[Bollywood Hungama]]:<ref name=\"Hindi Medium Cast & Crew\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/hindi-medium/cast/|title=Hindi Medium Cast & Crew|publisher=Bollywood Hungama|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=15 July 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715091657/https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/hindi-medium/cast/?movieid=3526|archivedate=15 July 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Irrfan Khan]] as Raj Batra\n** Delzad Hiwale as young Raj\n* [[Saba Qamar]] as Mita Batra\n** [[Sanjana Sanghi]] as young Mita\n* Kiran Khoje as Sushila\n* Dishita Sehgal as Pia Batra\n* [[Amrita Singh]] as Principal Lodha\n* [[Deepak Dobriyal]] as Shyam Prakash\n* [[Neelu Kohli]] as Mita's mother\n* Rajeev Gupta as Masterji, Raj's father\n* [[Sumit Gulati]] as Chotu\n* [[Mallika Dua]] as Dolly\n* Kulbir Kaur as Dolly's mother\n* Charu Shankar as Maya\n* [[Tillotama Shome]] as Shikha, a consultant\n* [[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]] as MLA\n* [[Taran Bajaj]] as tout\n* [[Ankur Jain]] as news reader\n* Swati Das as Tulsi\n* [[Neha Dhupia]] as Aarti (special appearance)\n* [[Sanjay Suri]] as Kabir (special appearance)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nMade on a production budget of {{\u20b9|14}} crore, ''Hindi Medium'' was produced by Vijan of Maddock Films and Bhushan Kumar of T-Series.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

India is a [[Federation|federal]] [[Parliamentary republic|parliamentary]] [[democratic republic]] in which the  [[President of India]]  is the [[head of state]] and the [[Prime Minister of India]] is the [[head of government]]. India follows the dual polity system, i.e. a double government (federal in nature) that consists of the central authority at the centre and [[States and union territories of India|states]] at the periphery. The constitution defines the organisational powers and limitations of both central and state governments, and it is well recognised, rigid and considered supreme; i.e. the [[Law of India|laws]] of the nation must confirm to it.\n\nThere is a provision for a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] consisting of an [[upper house]], the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of States), which represents the states of the Indian federation, and a [[lower house]], the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of the People), which represents the people of India as a whole. The Indian constitution provides for an [[Judicial independence|independent]] [[judiciary]], which is headed by the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]]. The court's mandate is to protect the constitution, to settle disputes between the central government and the states, to settle inter-state disputes, to nullify any central or state laws that go against the constitution and to protect the fundamental rights of citizens, issuing [[writs]] for their enforcement in cases of violation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Public Administration|publisher=Tata Mcgraw Hill|isbn=978-0071074827|pages=389\u2013390|author=M.Lakshmikanth|edition=9th|year=2012}}</ref>\nThere are 543 members in the Lok Sabha, who are elected from the 543 Indian constituencies.\nThere are 245 members in the Rajya Sabha, out of which 233 are elected by indirect elections by single transferable vote by the members of the state legislative assemblies and other 12 members are elected/nominated by the President of India.\nGovernments are formed through [[Elections in India|elections]] held every five years (unless otherwise specified), by parties that secure a majority of members in their respective lower houses (Lok Sabha in the central government and [[Vidhan Sabha]] in states). India had [[1951 Indian general election|its first general election]] in 1951, which was won by the [[Indian National Congress]], a political party that went on to dominate subsequent elections until [[1977 Indian general election|1977]], when a non-Congress government was formed for the first time in independent India. The 1990s saw the end of [[Dominant-party system|single-party domination]] and the rise of coalition governments. The [[2014 Indian general election|elections]] for the [[16th Lok Sabha]], held from April 2014 to May 2014, once again brought back single-party rule in the country, with the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] being able to claim a majority in the Lok Sabha.<ref>{{cite web|title=General Election 2014|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/GE2014/ge.html|work=[[Election Commission of India]]|accessdate=21 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523005228/http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/GE2014/ge.html|archive-date=23 May 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn recent decades, Indian politics has become a dynastic affair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnists/edit/need-for-accountability-in-politics-of-dynasty.html|title=Need for accountability in politics of dynasty|website=www.dailypioneer.com|access-date=17 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117002832/http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnists/edit/need-for-accountability-in-politics-of-dynasty.html|archive-date=17 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Possible reasons for this could be the party stability, absence of party organisations, independent civil society associations that mobilise support for the parties and centralised financing of elections.<ref name=\"ppq.sagepub.com\">{{cite journal|last1=Chhibber\u21d1|first1=Pradeep|title=Dynastic parties Organization, finance and impact|journal=Party Politics by Sage Journals|date=March 2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=277\u2013295|doi=10.1177/1354068811406995}}</ref> {{Democracy Index rating|India|flawed democracy|2019}}\n\n== Political parties and alliances ==\n{{elect|List of political parties in India|Elections in India}}\n{{Main|2019 Indian general election}}\n\nWhen compared to other democracies, India has had a large number of political parties during its history under democratic governance.

Further, party leadership roles are often transferred to subsequent generations in the same families. The two main parties in India are the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], also known as the BJP, which is the leading right-wing party, and the [[Indian National Congress]], commonly called the INC or Congress, which is the leading centre-left leaning party. These two parties currently dominate national politics, both adhering their policies loosely to their places on the [[left\u2013right political spectrum]]. At present, there are seven national parties and many more state parties.

A State party's legislative presence must be in the State Assembly.\n# A party can set up a candidate only from amongst its own members.\n# A party that loses its recognition shall not lose its symbol immediately but shall be allowed to use that symbol for some time to try and retrieve its status.

For example, between the 1984 and 1989 elections, the number of parties contesting elections increased from 33 to 113. In the decades since, this fragmentation has continued.<ref name=\"HickenKuhonta2014\">{{cite book|author1=Allen Hicken|author2=Erik Martinez Kuhonta|title=Party System Institutionalization in Asia: Democracies, Autocracies, and the Shadows of the Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZmiBQAAQBAJ&pg=PR13|date=29 December 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04157-8|page=205}}</ref>\n\n=== Alliances ===\nIndia has a history of party alliances and breakdown of alliances. However, there are three party alliances regularly aligning on a national level in competing for Government positions. The member parties work in harmony for gratifying national interests, although parties can jump ships. The three alliances are\u2013\n* [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) - Centre-Right coalition led by [[Bhartiya Janata Party]] (BJP) was formed in 1998 after the [[1998 Indian general election|elections]]. NDA formed a government, although the government didn't last long as [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|AIADMK]] withdrew support from it resulting in [[1999 Indian general election|1999 general elections]], in which NDA won and resumed power. The coalition government went on to complete the full five-years term, becoming the first non-Congress government to do so. In the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 General Elections]], NDA once again returned to power for the second time, with a historic mandate of 336 out of 543 Lok Sabha seats. BJP itself won 282 seats, thereby electing [[Narendra Modi]] as the head of the government. In a historic win, the NDA stormed to power for the third term in 2019 with a combined strength of 353 seats, with the BJP itself winning an absolute majority with 303 seats\n* [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) - Centre-Left coalition led by [[Indian National Congress]]; this alliance was created after the [[2004 Indian general election|2004 general elections]], with the alliance forming the Government. The alliance even after losing some of its members, was reelected in [[2009 Indian general election|2009 General Elections]] with [[Manmohan Singh]] as head of the government. The alliance has been in the opposition since the 2014 elections, with the INC being the principal opposition party, but without the official status of the Leader of Opposition since they failed to win the minimum required seats.\n* [[Third Front (India)|Third Front]] - A coalition of parties which do not belong to any of the above camps due to certain issues. One of the party in the alliance, the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|CPI(M)]], prior to [[2009 Indian general election|2009 general elections]], was a member party of the UPA. The alliance has no official leading party, and smaller parties often enter and leave the alliance according to political convenience. Many of these parties ally at national level but contest against each other at state level. The inherent problem with such a third front is that they are only bound together by the fact that they are not aligned to either of the two 'main' alliances, and not through similar ideological stances. This often means that this alliance is merely an alliance in name and does not really provide a united front which can serve as an alternative to the two historically prominent alliances. Therefore, despite the presence of this \"Third front,\" and other seeming alternatives for those seeking options outside the INC or BJP, Indian politics by and large remains a de facto two party system at the national level.\n\n===Corruption===\n[[Corruption in India|India has seen political corruption]] for decades. After the British left the subcontinent, the corruption became to be increasingly pronounced in the country. Democratic institutions soon became federally owned, dissent was eliminated and a majority of citizens paid the price. The political corruption in India is weakening its democracy and has led to the erosion of trust by the general public in the political system. A good amount of money is required in elections which is source of political-capitalist nexus.<ref>https://www.indianmirror.com/corruption/political-corruption.html</ref>\n\n===Candidate Selection===\nPre-election alliances are common in India with parties deciding to share seats. This is seen mainly on a state by state basis rather than on the national level. Candidate selection starts after seat sharing has been agreed by alliance partners.\n\nIndian political parties have low level of internal party democracy and therefore, in Indian elections, both at the state or national level, party candidates are typically selected by the party elites, more commonly called the party high command. The party elites use a number of criteria for selecting candidates. These include the ability of the candidates to finance their own election, their educational attainment, and the level of organization the candidates have in their respective constituencies.<ref>{{cite news |title=How political parties choose their candidates to win elections |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-political-parties-choose-their-candidates-to-win-elections/story-26nqJKdMEQfYm8Uq29tbwJ.html |accessdate=22 April 2019 |issue=26 March 2018 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422184718/https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-political-parties-choose-their-candidates-to-win-elections/story-26nqJKdMEQfYm8Uq29tbwJ.html |archive-date=22 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Quite often the last criterion is associated with candidate criminality.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Caste Politics, Credibility and Criminality: Political Selection in India|first=Milan|last=Vaishnav|date=10 December 2011|ssrn = 1899847}}</ref>\n\n== Local governance ==\n{{Main|Municipal governance in India|Panchayati raj in India|Local self-government in India}}\nPanchayati Raj Institutions or Local self-government bodies play a crucial role in Indian politics, as it focuses on grassroot-level administration in India.\n\nOn 24 April 1993, the Constitutional (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992 came into force to provide constitutional status to the Panchayati Raj institutions. This Act was extended to Panchayats in the tribal areas of eight States, namely Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan from 24 December 1996.\n\nThe Act aims to provide 3-tier system of Panchayati Raj for all States having population of over 2 million, to hold Panchayat elections regularly every 5 years, to provide reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Women, to appoint State Finance Commission to make recommendations as regards the financial powers of the Panchayats and to constitute District Planning Committee to prepare draft development plan for the district.\n\n== Role of political parties ==\n{{Party politics}}\n{{elect|List of political parties in India|Elections in India}}\nAs with any other democracy, political parties represent different sections among the Indian society and regions, and their core values play a major role in the politics of India. Both the executive branch and the legislative branch of the government are run by the representatives of the political parties who have been elected through the elections. Through the electoral process, the people of India choose which representative and which political party should run the government. Through the elections any party may gain simple majority in the lower house. Coalitions are formed by the political parties, in case no single party gains a simple majority in the lower house. Unless a party or a coalition have a majority in the lower house, a government cannot be formed by that party or the coalition.\n\n[[File:State- and union territory-level parties.svg|thumb|344x344px|Current ruling parties in the states and union territories of India\n{{legend|#ff9933|[[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] (12)}}\n{{legend|#ffc969|[[National Democratic Alliance|Coalition with BJP]] (6)}}\n{{legend|#00bfff|[[Indian National Congress|INC]] (4)}}\n{{legend|#00ebff|[[United Progressive Alliance|Coalition with INC]] (2)}}\n{{legend|#ff0000|Other parties<br />([[Aam Aadmi Party|AAP]], [[All India Trinamool Congress|AITC]], [[Biju Janata Dal|BJD]], [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|CPI(M)]], [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi|TRS]] and [[YSR Congress Party|YSRCP]]) (6)}}\n{{legend|#000000|[[President's rule]] (1)}}\n{{legend|#808080|[[Union territory|No legislature]] (5)}}]]\n\nIndia has a [[multi-party system]], where there are a number of national as well as regional parties. A regional party may gain a majority and rule a particular state. If a party is represented in more than 4 states, it would be labelled a national party. Out of the 72 years of India's independence, India has been ruled by the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) for 53 of those years, as of January 2020.\n\nThe party enjoyed a parliamentary majority save for two brief periods during the 1970s and late 1980s. This rule was interrupted between 1977 and 1980, when the [[Janata Party]] coalition won the election owing to public discontent with the [[Indian Emergency (1975 - 77)|controversial state of emergency]] declared by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. The [[Janata Dal]] won elections in 1989, but its government managed to hold on to power for only two years.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by the nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) followed by a left-leaning [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-INC and coalition government to complete a full five-year term. The [[2004 Indian general elections|2004 Indian elections]] saw the INC winning the largest number of seats to form a government leading the [[United Progressive Alliance]], and supported by left-parties and those opposed to the BJP.\n\nOn 22 May 2004, [[Manmohan Singh]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indianembassy.org/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126154402/https://www.indianembassy.org/India_Review/2009/June%202009.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Welcome to Embassy of India, Washington D C, USA|archivedate=26 January 2012|website=www.indianembassy.org}}</ref> was appointed the [[Prime Minister of India]] following the victory of the [[Indian National Congress|INC]] & the left front in the [[2004 Indian general election|2004 Lok Sabha election]]. The [[United Progressive Alliance|UPA]]  ruled India without the support of the left front. Previously, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]<ref name=\" Priyanka Shah\">{{cite news|title=13 Amazing Facts about Atal Ji, the Bhishma Pitamah of Indian Politics|url=http://topyaps.com/n-amazing-facts-about-atalji-the-bhishma-pitamah-of-indian-politics|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Topyaps|date=1 November 2014|author=Priyanka Shah|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911030525/http://topyaps.com/n-amazing-facts-about-atalji-the-bhishma-pitamah-of-indian-politics|archive-date=11 September 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> had taken office in October 1999 after a general election in which a BJP-led coalition of 13 parties called the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] emerged with a majority. In May 2014, Narendra Modi of BJP was elected as Prime Minister of India.\n\nFormation of coalition governments reflects the transition in Indian politics away from the national parties toward smaller, more narrowly based [[regional party|regional parties]]. Some regional parties, especially in South India, are deeply aligned to the ideologies of the region unlike the national parties and thus the relationship between the central government and the state government in various states has not always been free of rancor. Disparity between the ideologies of the political parties ruling the centre and the state leads to severely skewed allocation of resources between the states.\n\n== Political Issues ==\n{{Main|Socio-economic issues in India}}\n{{See also|Corruption in India}}\n\n=== Social issues ===\nThe [[Demographics of India|lack of homogeneity]] in the Indian population causes division between different sections of the people based on [[Communalism (South Asia)|religion]], [[Regionalism (politics)|region]], [[Language politics|language]], [[Caste politics|caste]] and [[Dravidian politics|ethnicity]]. This has led to the rise of political parties with agendas catering to one or a mix of these groups. Parties in India also target people who are not in favour of other parties and use them as an asset.\n\nSome parties openly profess their focus on a particular group; for example, the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]]'s and the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]]'s focus on the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] population and [[Tamil people|Tamil]] identity; [[Biju Janata Dal]]'s championing of [[Odia culture]]; the [[Shiv Sena]]'s pro-[[Marathi people|Marathi]] agenda; [[Naga People's Front]]'s demand for protection of [[Naga people|Naga]] tribal identity; [[Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party|People's Democratic Party]] ;[[Jammu & Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]]'s calling for [[Kashmiri Muslim]] identity and The [[Telugu Desam Party]] was formed in United Andhra Pradesh by late Shri [[N.T.Rama Rao]] which demands for rights and needs of people of the state only. Some other parties claim to be universal in nature, but tend to draw support from particular sections of the population. For example, the [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]] (translated as National People's Party) has a vote bank among the [[Yadav caste|Yadav]] and [[Muslim]] population of [[Bihar]] and the [[All India Trinamool Congress]] does not have any significant support outside [[West Bengal]].\n\nThe narrow focus and [[Votebank|votebank politics]] of most parties, even in the central government and central legislature, supplements national issues such as economic welfare and national security. Moreover, internal security is also threatened as incidences of political parties instigating and leading violence between two opposing groups of people is a frequent occurrence.\n\n=== Economic problems ===\n[[File:Door-to-door campaigning - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|Door-to-door campaigning of a political party workers]]\nEconomic issues like [[Poverty in India|poverty]], [[Unemployment in India|unemployment]], [[Economic development|development]] are main issues that influence politics. ''Garibi Hatao'' (eradicate poverty) has been a slogan of the [[Indian National Congress]] for a long time. The well known [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] encourages a [[free market]] economy. The more popular slogan in this field is ''Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'' (Cooperation with all, progress of all). The [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] vehemently supports [[left-wing]] politics like [[Land reform|land-for-all]], [[right to work]] and strongly opposes neoliberal policies such as [[globalisation]], [[capitalism]] and [[privatisation]].\n\n=== Law and order ===\n[[Terrorism in India|Terrorism]], [[Naxalism]], [[Religious violence in India|religious violence]] and [[Caste-related violence in India|caste-related violence]] are important issues that affect the political environment of the Indian nation. Stringent anti-terror legislation such as [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act|TADA]], [[Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002|POTA]] and [[Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act|MCOCA]] have received much political attention, both in favour and opposed and some of these laws were disbanded eventually due to human rights violations,<ref name=\"human_rights_violation\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/asia/india-bck1121.htm|title=Anti-Terrorism Legislation|work=Human rights watch|date=20 November 2001|accessdate=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703041343/https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/asia/india-bck1121.htm|archive-date=3 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> however [[UAPA]] was put into force again in 2019 after a new legislation.\n\nTerrorism has affected politics India since its conception, be it the [[Pakistan and state sponsored terrorism|terrorism supported from Pakistan]] or the internal guerrilla groups such as [[Naxalites]].

She/He is elected for a five-year term by an electoral college consisting of members of both Houses of Parliament and members of legislative assemblies of the states. The President is eligible for re-elections; however, in India's independent history, only one president has been re-elected, [[Rajendra Prasad]].\n\nThe President appoints the Prime Minister of India from the party or coalition which commands maximum support of the Lok Sabha, on whose recommendation he/she nominates the other ministers. The President also appoints judges of the Supreme Court and High Court. It is on the President's recommendation that the Houses of Parliament meet, and only the president has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha. Furthermore, no bill passed by Parliament can become law without the president's assent.\n\nHowever, the role of the president of India is highly ceremonial. All the powers of the president mentioned above are exercised on recommendation of the Union [[Indian Cabinet|Cabinet]], and the president does not have much discretion in any of these matters. The president also does not have discretion in the exercise of his executive powers, as the real executive authority lies in the cabinet. The current President is [[Ram Nath Kovind]].\n\n=== Vice President of India ===\n{{main|Vice President of India}}\n\nThe Office of the Vice-President of India is constitutionally the second most senior office in the country, after the President. The vice-president is also elected by an electoral college, consisting of members of both houses of parliament.\n\nLike the president, the role of the Vice-President is also ceremonial, with no real authority vested in him/her. The Vice-President fills in a vacancy in the office of President (till the election of a new president). His only regular function is that he functions as the Chairman of the [[Rajya Sabha]]. No other duties/powers are vested in the office. The current Vice President is [[Venkaiah Naidu]].\n\n=== The Prime Minister and the Union Council of Ministers ===\n{{further|Prime Minister of India|Union Council of Ministers|Second Modi ministry}}\nThe Union Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, is the body with which the real executive power resides. The Prime Minister is the recognized head of the government.\n\nThe Union Council of Ministers is the body of ministers with which the PM works with on a day-to-day basis. Work is divided between various ministers into various departments and ministries. The Union cabinet is a smaller body of ministers which lies within the Council of Ministers, which is the most powerful set of people in the country, playing an instrumental role in legislation and execution alike. \n\nAll members of the Union Council of ministers must be members of either House of Parliament at the time of appointment or must get elected/nominated to either House within six months of their appointment.\n\nIt is the Union Cabinet that co-ordinates all foreign and domestic policy of the Union. It exercises immense control over administration, finance, legislation, military, etc. The Head of the Union Cabinet is the Prime Minister. The current Prime Minister of India is [[Narendra Modi]].\n\n== State Governments ==\n{{main|State governments of India}}\nIndia has a [[Federalism in India|federal form]] of government, and hence each state also has its own government. The executive of each state is the Governor (equivalent to the president of India), whose role is ceremonial. The real power resides with the Chief Minister (equivalent to the Prime Minister) and the state council of ministers. States may either have a unicameral or bicameral legislature, varying from state to state. The Chief Minister and other state ministers are also members of the legislature.\n\n== [[Nepotism]] in Indian Politics ==\n{{main|Political families of India}}\nSince the 1980s, Indian politics has become dynastic, possibly due to the absence of a party organization, independent civil society associations that mobilize support for the party, and centralized financing of elections.<ref name=\"ppq.sagepub.com\"/> This phenomenon is seen from national level down to district level. One example of dynastic politics has been the [[Nehru\u2013Gandhi family]] which produced [[List of prime ministers of India|three]] [[Prime Minister of India|Indian prime ministers]]. Family members have also led the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] for most of the period since 1978 when Indira Gandhi floated the then Congress(I) faction of the party.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Basu|first1=Amrita|last2=Chandra (Editor)|first2=Kanchan|title=Democratic Dynasties: State, Party and Family in Contemporary Indian Politics|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-1-107-12344-1|page=136|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tesIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PR10&dq=%22political+dynasties%22+india#v=onepage&q=sonia&f=false|accessdate=23 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110030054/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=tesIDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR10&dq=%22political+dynasties%22+india&ots=panvSUPVV9&sig=rBLRMVvTQ2f7mX6q3bm6Gj6eyfw#v=onepage&q=sonia&f=false|archive-date=10 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Dynastic politics is prevalent also in a  number of political parties with regional presence such as [[All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen]], [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]], [[Indian National Lok Dal]], [[Jammu & Kashmir National Conference]], [[Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party]], [[Janata Dal (Secular)]], [[Jharkhand Mukti Morcha]], [[National People's Party (India)|National People's Party]], [[Nationalist Congress Party]], [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]], [[Rashtriya Lok Dal]], [[Samajwadi Party]], [[Shiromani Akali Dal]], [[Shiv Sena]], [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi]] and [[Telugu Desam Party]]. <ref name=\"Chandra2016\">{{cite book|author=Kanchan Chandra|title=Democratic Dynasties: State, Party, and Family in Contemporary Indian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VwbFDAAAQBAJ&pg=PR10|date=28 April 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-316-59212-0|page=131,136}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Government of India]]\n* [[State governments of India]]\n* [[Law of India]]\n* [[Indian political scandals]]\n* [[Disqualification of convicted representatives in India]]\n* [[Political families of India]]\n* [[List of think tanks in India]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [[Satyabrata Rai Chowdhuri|Chowdhuri, Satyabrata Rai]].

India is a [[Federation|federal]] [[Parliamentary republic|parliamentary]] [[democratic republic]] in which the  [[President of India]]  is the [[head of state]] and the [[Prime Minister of India]] is the [[head of government]]. India follows the dual polity system, i.e. a double government (federal in nature) that consists of the central authority at the centre and [[States and union territories of India|states]] at the periphery. The constitution defines the organisational powers and limitations of both central and state governments, and it is well recognised, rigid and considered supreme; i.e. the [[Law of India|laws]] of the nation must confirm to it.\n\nThere is a provision for a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] consisting of an [[upper house]], the [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of States), which represents the states of the Indian federation, and a [[lower house]], the [[Lok Sabha]] (House of the People), which represents the people of India as a whole. The Indian constitution provides for an [[Judicial independence|independent]] [[judiciary]], which is headed by the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]]. The court's mandate is to protect the constitution, to settle disputes between the central government and the states, to settle inter-state disputes, to nullify any central or state laws that go against the constitution and to protect the fundamental rights of citizens, issuing [[writs]] for their enforcement in cases of violation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Public Administration|publisher=Tata Mcgraw Hill|isbn=978-0071074827|pages=389\u2013390|author=M.Lakshmikanth|edition=9th|year=2012}}</ref>\nThere are 543 members in the Lok Sabha, who are elected from the 543 Indian constituencies.\nThere are 245 members in the Rajya Sabha, out of which 233 are elected by indirect elections by single transferable vote by the members of the state legislative assemblies and other 12 members are elected/nominated by the President of India.\nGovernments are formed through [[Elections in India|elections]] held every five years (unless otherwise specified), by parties that secure a majority of members in their respective lower houses (Lok Sabha in the central government and [[Vidhan Sabha]] in states). India had [[1951 Indian general election|its first general election]] in 1951, which was won by the [[Indian National Congress]], a political party that went on to dominate subsequent elections until [[1977 Indian general election|1977]], when a non-Congress government was formed for the first time in independent India. The 1990s saw the end of [[Dominant-party system|single-party domination]] and the rise of coalition governments. The [[2014 Indian general election|elections]] for the [[16th Lok Sabha]], held from April 2014 to May 2014, once again brought back single-party rule in the country, with the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] being able to claim a majority in the Lok Sabha.<ref>{{cite web|title=General Election 2014|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/GE2014/ge.html|work=[[Election Commission of India]]|accessdate=21 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523005228/http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/GE2014/ge.html|archive-date=23 May 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn recent decades, Indian politics has become a dynastic affair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnists/edit/need-for-accountability-in-politics-of-dynasty.html|title=Need for accountability in politics of dynasty|website=www.dailypioneer.com|access-date=17 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117002832/http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnists/edit/need-for-accountability-in-politics-of-dynasty.html|archive-date=17 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Possible reasons for this could be the party stability, absence of party organisations, independent civil society associations that mobilise support for the parties and centralised financing of elections.<ref name=\"ppq.sagepub.com\">{{cite journal|last1=Chhibber\u21d1|first1=Pradeep|title=Dynastic parties Organization, finance and impact|journal=Party Politics by Sage Journals|date=March 2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=277\u2013295|doi=10.1177/1354068811406995}}</ref> {{Democracy Index rating|India|flawed democracy|2019}}\n\n== Political parties and alliances ==\n{{elect|List of political parties in India|Elections in India}}\n{{Main|2019 Indian general election}}\n\nWhen compared to other democracies, India has had a large number of political parties during its history under democratic governance. It has been estimated that over 200 parties were formed after India became independent in 1947.<ref name=CPIR>{{cite book|title=Comparative Politics & International Relations|publisher=Cosmos Bookhive|isbn=817729035-5|pages=129\u2013134|author=Prakash Chander, Prem Arora|chapter=Nature of Party System in India|year=2001}}</ref> Leadership of political parties in India is commonly interwoven with well-known families whose dynastic leaders actively play the dominant role in a party. Further, party leadership roles are often transferred to subsequent generations in the same families. The two main parties in India are the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], also known as the BJP, which is the leading right-wing party, and the [[Indian National Congress]], commonly called the INC or Congress, which is the leading centre-left leaning party. These two parties currently dominate national politics, both adhering their policies loosely to their places on the [[left\u2013right political spectrum]]. At present, there are seven national parties and many more state parties. [[File:Sansad Bhavan-1.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Parliament of India]]]]\n\n=== Types of political parties ===\n{{Main|List of political parties in India}}\nEvery political party in India - whether a national or regional/state party - must have a symbol and must be registered with the [[Election Commission of India]]. Symbols are used in the Indian political system to identify political parties in part so that illiterate people can vote by recognizing the party symbols.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/11/the-curious-stories-of-indian-party-symbols/|title=The Curious Stories of Indian Party Symbols|work=[[The Diplomat]]|author=Krzysztof Iwanek|date=2 November 2016|accessdate=19 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419193824/http://thediplomat.com/2016/11/the-curious-stories-of-indian-party-symbols/|archive-date=19 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the current amendment to the Symbols Order, the Commission has asserted the following five principles:<ref name=ECI />\n# A party, National or State, must have a legislative presence.\n# A National party's legislative presence must be in the Lok Sabha. A State party's legislative presence must be in the State Assembly.\n# A party can set up a candidate only from amongst its own members.\n# A party that loses its recognition shall not lose its symbol immediately but shall be allowed to use that symbol for some time to try and retrieve its status. (However, the grant of such facility to the party will not mean the extension of other facilities to it, as are available to recognized parties, such as free time on [[Doordarshan]] or [[All India Radio|AIR]], free supply of copies of electoral rolls, etc.)\n# Recognition should be given to a party only on the basis of its own performance in elections and not because it is a splinter group of some other recognized party.\n\n'''Criteria'''\n* A political party shall be eligible to be recognized as a '''''National''''' party if:<ref name=\"ECI\">{{cite web|title=Election Commission Of India Press Note|url=http://eci.nic.in/archive/press/current/PN05122k.htm|accessdate=13 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305090629/http://eci.nic.in/archive/press/current/PN05122k.htm|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n# it secures at least '''six percent (6%)''' of the valid votes polled in any four or more states, at a general election to the House of the People or, to the State Legislative Assembly; and\n# in addition, it wins at least '''four''' seats in the House of the People from any State or States.\n;OR\nit wins at least '''two percent (2%)''' seats in the House of the People (i.e., 11 seats in the existing House having 543 members), and these members are elected from at least '''three''' different States.\n* Likewise, a political party shall be entitled to be recognized as a '''''State''''' party, if:\n\n# it secures at least '''six percent (6%)''' of the valid votes polled in the State at a general election, either to the House of the People or to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned; and\n# in addition, it wins at least '''two''' seats in the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned.\n;OR\nit wins at least '''three percent (3%)''' of the total number of seats in the Legislative Assembly of the State, or at least '''three''' seats in the Assembly, whichever is more.\n\n===Party proliferation===\nSince 1984, when a strict anti-defection law was passed, there has been a tendency amongst the Indian politicians to float their own parties rather than join a broad based party such as the Congress or the BJP. For example, between the 1984 and 1989 elections, the number of parties contesting elections increased from 33 to 113. In the decades since, this fragmentation has continued.<ref name=\"HickenKuhonta2014\">{{cite book|author1=Allen Hicken|author2=Erik Martinez Kuhonta|title=Party System Institutionalization in Asia: Democracies, Autocracies, and the Shadows of the Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZmiBQAAQBAJ&pg=PR13|date=29 December 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04157-8|page=205}}</ref>\n\n=== Alliances ===\nIndia has a history of party alliances and breakdown of alliances. However, there are three party alliances regularly aligning on a national level in competing for Government positions. The member parties work in harmony for gratifying national interests, although parties can jump ships. The three alliances are\u2013\n* [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) - Centre-Right coalition led by [[Bhartiya Janata Party]] (BJP) was formed in 1998 after the [[1998 Indian general election|elections]]. NDA formed a government, although the government didn't last long as [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|AIADMK]] withdrew support from it resulting in [[1999 Indian general election|1999 general elections]], in which NDA won and resumed power. The coalition government went on to complete the full five-years term, becoming the first non-Congress government to do so. In the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 General Elections]], NDA once again returned to power for the second time, with a historic mandate of 336 out of 543 Lok Sabha seats. BJP itself won 282 seats, thereby electing [[Narendra Modi]] as the head of the government. In a historic win, the NDA stormed to power for the third term in 2019 with a combined strength of 353 seats, with the BJP itself winning an absolute majority with 303 seats\n* [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) - Centre-Left coalition led by [[Indian National Congress]]; this alliance was created after the [[2004 Indian general election|2004 general elections]], with the alliance forming the Government. The alliance even after losing some of its members, was reelected in [[2009 Indian general election|2009 General Elections]] with [[Manmohan Singh]] as head of the government. The alliance has been in the opposition since the 2014 elections, with the INC being the principal opposition party, but without the official status of the Leader of Opposition since they failed to win the minimum required seats.\n* [[Third Front (India)|Third Front]] - A coalition of parties which do not belong to any of the above camps due to certain issues. One of the party in the alliance, the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|CPI(M)]], prior to [[2009 Indian general election|2009 general elections]], was a member party of the UPA. The alliance has no official leading party, and smaller parties often enter and leave the alliance according to political convenience. Many of these parties ally at national level but contest against each other at state level. The inherent problem with such a third front is that they are only bound together by the fact that they are not aligned to either of the two 'main' alliances, and not through similar ideological stances. This often means that this alliance is merely an alliance in name and does not really provide a united front which can serve as an alternative to the two historically prominent alliances. Therefore, despite the presence of this \"Third front,\" and other seeming alternatives for those seeking options outside the INC or BJP, Indian politics by and large remains a de facto two party system at the national level.\n\n===Corruption===\n[[Corruption in India|India has seen political corruption]] for decades. After the British left the subcontinent, the corruption became to be increasingly pronounced in the country. Democratic institutions soon became federally owned, dissent was eliminated and a majority of citizens paid the price. The political corruption in India is weakening its democracy and has led to the erosion of trust by the general public in the political system. A good amount of money is required in elections which is source of political-capitalist nexus.<ref>https://www.indianmirror.com/corruption/political-corruption.html</ref>\n\n===Candidate selection===\nPre-election alliances are common in India with parties deciding to share seats. This is seen mainly on a state by state basis rather than on the national level. Candidate selection starts after seat sharing has been agreed by alliance partners.\n\nIndian political parties have low level of internal party democracy and therefore, in Indian elections, both at the state or national level, party candidates are typically selected by the party elites, more commonly called the party high command. The party elites use a number of criteria for selecting candidates. These include the ability of the candidates to finance their own election, their educational attainment, and the level of organization the candidates have in their respective constituencies.<ref>{{cite news |title=How political parties choose their candidates to win elections |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-political-parties-choose-their-candidates-to-win-elections/story-26nqJKdMEQfYm8Uq29tbwJ.html |accessdate=22 April 2019 |issue=26 March 2018 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422184718/https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-political-parties-choose-their-candidates-to-win-elections/story-26nqJKdMEQfYm8Uq29tbwJ.html |archive-date=22 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Quite often the last criterion is associated with candidate criminality.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Caste Politics, Credibility and Criminality: Political Selection in India|first=Milan|last=Vaishnav|date=10 December 2011|ssrn = 1899847}}</ref>\n\n== Local governance ==\n{{Main|Municipal governance in India|Panchayati raj in India|Local self-government in India}}\nPanchayati Raj Institutions or Local self-government bodies play a crucial role in Indian politics, as it focuses on grassroot-level administration in India.\n\nOn 24 April 1993, the Constitutional (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992 came into force to provide constitutional status to the Panchayati Raj institutions. This Act was extended to Panchayats in the tribal areas of eight States, namely Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan from 24 December 1996.\n\nThe Act aims to provide 3-tier system of Panchayati Raj for all States having population of over 2 million, to hold Panchayat elections regularly every 5 years, to provide reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Women, to appoint State Finance Commission to make recommendations as regards the financial powers of the Panchayats and to constitute District Planning Committee to prepare draft development plan for the district.\n\n== Role of political parties ==\n{{Party politics}}\n{{elect|List of political parties in India|Elections in India}}\nAs with any other democracy, political parties represent different sections among the Indian society and regions, and their core values play a major role in the politics of India. Both the executive branch and the legislative branch of the government are run by the representatives of the political parties who have been elected through the elections. Through the electoral process, the people of India choose which representative and which political party should run the government. Through the elections any party may gain simple majority in the lower house. Coalitions are formed by the political parties, in case no single party gains a simple majority in the lower house. Unless a party or a coalition have a majority in the lower house, a government cannot be formed by that party or the coalition.\n\n[[File:State- and union territory-level parties.svg|thumb|344x344px|Current ruling parties in the states and union territories of India\n{{legend|#ff9933|[[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] (12)}}\n{{legend|#ffc969|[[National Democratic Alliance|Coalition with BJP]] (6)}}\n{{legend|#00bfff|[[Indian National Congress|INC]] (4)}}\n{{legend|#00ebff|[[United Progressive Alliance|Coalition with INC]] (2)}}\n{{legend|#ff0000|Other parties<br />([[Aam Aadmi Party|AAP]], [[All India Trinamool Congress|AITC]], [[Biju Janata Dal|BJD]], [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|CPI(M)]], [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi|TRS]] and [[YSR Congress Party|YSRCP]]) (6)}}\n{{legend|#000000|[[President's rule]] (1)}}\n{{legend|#808080|[[Union territory|No legislature]] (5)}}]]\n\nIndia has a [[multi-party system]], where there are a number of national as well as regional parties. A regional party may gain a majority and rule a particular state. If a party is represented in more than 4 states, it would be labelled a national party. Out of the 72 years of India's independence, India has been ruled by the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) for 53 of those years, as of January 2020.\n\nThe party enjoyed a parliamentary majority save for two brief periods during the 1970s and late 1980s. This rule was interrupted between 1977 and 1980, when the [[Janata Party]] coalition won the election owing to public discontent with the [[Indian Emergency (1975 - 77)|controversial state of emergency]] declared by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. The [[Janata Dal]] won elections in 1989, but its government managed to hold on to power for only two years.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by the nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) followed by a left-leaning [[United Front (India)|United Front]] coalition. In 1998, the BJP formed the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-INC and coalition government to complete a full five-year term. The [[2004 Indian general elections|2004 Indian elections]] saw the INC winning the largest number of seats to form a government leading the [[United Progressive Alliance]], and supported by left-parties and those opposed to the BJP.\n\nOn 22 May 2004, [[Manmohan Singh]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indianembassy.org/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126154402/https://www.indianembassy.org/India_Review/2009/June%202009.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Welcome to Embassy of India, Washington D C, USA|archivedate=26 January 2012|website=www.indianembassy.org}}</ref> was appointed the [[Prime Minister of India]] following the victory of the [[Indian National Congress|INC]] & the left front in the [[2004 Indian general election|2004 Lok Sabha election]]. The [[United Progressive Alliance|UPA]]  ruled India without the support of the left front. Previously, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]<ref name=\" Priyanka Shah\">{{cite news|title=13 Amazing Facts about Atal Ji, the Bhishma Pitamah of Indian Politics|url=http://topyaps.com/n-amazing-facts-about-atalji-the-bhishma-pitamah-of-indian-politics|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Topyaps|date=1 November 2014|author=Priyanka Shah|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911030525/http://topyaps.com/n-amazing-facts-about-atalji-the-bhishma-pitamah-of-indian-politics|archive-date=11 September 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> had taken office in October 1999 after a general election in which a BJP-led coalition of 13 parties called the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] emerged with a majority. In May 2014, Narendra Modi of BJP was elected as Prime Minister of India.\n\nFormation of coalition governments reflects the transition in Indian politics away from the national parties toward smaller, more narrowly based [[regional party|regional parties]]. Some regional parties, especially in South India, are deeply aligned to the ideologies of the region unlike the national parties and thus the relationship between the central government and the state government in various states has not always been free of rancor. Disparity between the ideologies of the political parties ruling the centre and the state leads to severely skewed allocation of resources between the states.\n\n== Political issues ==\n{{Main|Socio-economic issues in India}}\n{{See also|Corruption in India}}\n\n=== Social issues ===\nThe [[Demographics of India|lack of homogeneity]] in the Indian population causes division between different sections of the people based on [[Communalism (South Asia)|religion]], [[Regionalism (politics)|region]], [[Language politics|language]], [[Caste politics|caste]] and [[Dravidian politics|ethnicity]]. This has led to the rise of political parties with agendas catering to one or a mix of these groups. Parties in India also target people who are not in favour of other parties and use them as an asset.\n\nSome parties openly profess their focus on a particular group; for example, the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]]'s and the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]]'s focus on the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] population and [[Tamil people|Tamil]] identity; [[Biju Janata Dal]]'s championing of [[Odia culture]]; the [[Shiv Sena]]'s pro-[[Marathi people|Marathi]] agenda; [[Naga People's Front]]'s demand for protection of [[Naga people|Naga]] tribal identity; [[Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party|People's Democratic Party]] ;[[Jammu & Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]]'s calling for [[Kashmiri Muslim]] identity and The [[Telugu Desam Party]] was formed in United Andhra Pradesh by late Shri [[N.T.Rama Rao]] which demands for rights and needs of people of the state only. Some other parties claim to be universal in nature, but tend to draw support from particular sections of the population. For example, the [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]] (translated as National People's Party) has a vote bank among the [[Yadav caste|Yadav]] and [[Muslim]] population of [[Bihar]] and the [[All India Trinamool Congress]] does not have any significant support outside [[West Bengal]].\n\nThe narrow focus and [[Votebank|votebank politics]] of most parties, even in the central government and central legislature, supplements national issues such as economic welfare and national security. Moreover, internal security is also threatened as incidences of political parties instigating and leading violence between two opposing groups of people is a frequent occurrence.\n\n=== Economic problems ===\n[[File:Door-to-door campaigning - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|Door-to-door campaigning of a political party workers]]\nEconomic issues like [[Poverty in India|poverty]], [[Unemployment in India|unemployment]], [[Economic development|development]] are main issues that influence politics. ''Garibi Hatao'' (eradicate poverty) has been a slogan of the [[Indian National Congress]] for a long time. The well known [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] encourages a [[free market]] economy. The more popular slogan in this field is ''Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'' (Cooperation with all, progress of all).

She/He is elected for a five-year term by an electoral college consisting of members of both Houses of Parliament and members of legislative assemblies of the states. The President is eligible for re-elections; however, in India's independent history, only one president has been re-elected, [[Rajendra Prasad]].\n\nThe President appoints the Prime Minister of India from the party or coalition which commands maximum support of the Lok Sabha, on whose recommendation he/she nominates the other ministers. The President also appoints judges of the Supreme Court and High Court. It is on the President's recommendation that the Houses of Parliament meet, and only the president has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha. Furthermore, no bill passed by Parliament can become law without the president's assent.\n\nHowever, the role of the president of India is highly ceremonial. All the powers of the president mentioned above are exercised on recommendation of the Union [[Indian Cabinet|Cabinet]], and the president does not have much discretion in any of these matters. The president also does not have discretion in the exercise of his executive powers, as the real executive authority lies in the cabinet. The current President is [[Ram Nath Kovind]].\n\n=== Vice President of India ===\n{{main|Vice President of India}}\n\nThe Office of the Vice-President of India is constitutionally the second most senior office in the country, after the President. The vice-president is also elected by an electoral college, consisting of members of both houses of parliament.\n\nLike the president, the role of the Vice-President is also ceremonial, with no real authority vested in him/her. The Vice-President fills in a vacancy in the office of President (till the election of a new president). His only regular function is that he functions as the Chairman of the [[Rajya Sabha]]. No other duties/powers are vested in the office. The current Vice President is [[Venkaiah Naidu]].\n\n=== The Prime Minister and the Union Council of Ministers ===\n{{further|Prime Minister of India|Union Council of Ministers|Second Modi ministry}}\nThe Union Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, is the body with which the real executive power resides. The Prime Minister is the recognized head of the government.\n\nThe Union Council of Ministers is the body of ministers with which the PM works with on a day-to-day basis. Work is divided between various ministers into various departments and ministries. The Union cabinet is a smaller body of ministers which lies within the Council of Ministers, which is the most powerful set of people in the country, playing an instrumental role in legislation and execution alike. \n\nAll members of the Union Council of ministers must be members of either House of Parliament at the time of appointment or must get elected/nominated to either House within six months of their appointment.\n\nIt is the Union Cabinet that co-ordinates all foreign and domestic policy of the Union. It exercises immense control over administration, finance, legislation, military, etc. The Head of the Union Cabinet is the Prime Minister. The current Prime Minister of India is [[Narendra Modi]].\n\n== State Governments ==\n{{main|State governments of India}}\nIndia has a [[Federalism in India|federal form]] of government, and hence each state also has its own government. The executive of each state is the Governor (equivalent to the president of India), whose role is ceremonial. The real power resides with the Chief Minister (equivalent to the Prime Minister) and the state council of ministers. States may either have a unicameral or bicameral legislature, varying from state to state. The Chief Minister and other state ministers are also members of the legislature.\n\n== [[Nepotism]] in Indian Politics ==\n{{main|Political families of India}}\nSince the 1980s, Indian politics has become dynastic, possibly due to the absence of a party organization, independent civil society associations that mobilize support for the party, and centralized financing of elections.<ref name=\"ppq.sagepub.com\"/> This phenomenon is seen from national level down to district level. One example of dynastic politics has been the [[Nehru\u2013Gandhi family]] which produced [[List of prime ministers of India|three]] [[Prime Minister of India|Indian prime ministers]]. Family members have also led the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] for most of the period since 1978 when Indira Gandhi floated the then Congress(I) faction of the party.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Basu|first1=Amrita|last2=Chandra (Editor)|first2=Kanchan|title=Democratic Dynasties: State, Party and Family in Contemporary Indian Politics|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-1-107-12344-1|page=136|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tesIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PR10&dq=%22political+dynasties%22+india#v=onepage&q=sonia&f=false|accessdate=23 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110030054/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=tesIDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR10&dq=%22political+dynasties%22+india&ots=panvSUPVV9&sig=rBLRMVvTQ2f7mX6q3bm6Gj6eyfw#v=onepage&q=sonia&f=false|archive-date=10 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Dynastic politics is prevalent also in a  number of political parties with regional presence such as [[All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen]], [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]], [[Indian National Lok Dal]], [[Jammu & Kashmir National Conference]], [[Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party]], [[Janata Dal (Secular)]], [[Jharkhand Mukti Morcha]], [[National People's Party (India)|National People's Party]], [[Nationalist Congress Party]], [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]], [[Rashtriya Lok Dal]], [[Samajwadi Party]], [[Shiromani Akali Dal]], [[Shiv Sena]], [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi]] and [[Telugu Desam Party]]. <ref name=\"Chandra2016\">{{cite book|author=Kanchan Chandra|title=Democratic Dynasties: State, Party, and Family in Contemporary Indian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VwbFDAAAQBAJ&pg=PR10|date=28 April 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-316-59212-0|page=131,136}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Government of India]]\n* [[State governments of India]]\n* [[Law of India]]\n* [[Indian political scandals]]\n* [[Disqualification of convicted representatives in India]]\n* [[Political families of India]]\n* [[List of think tanks in India]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [[Satyabrata Rai Chowdhuri|Chowdhuri, Satyabrata Rai]].
