Seger overhauled \"This Old House\" into \"We've Got Tonite\" the day after seeing the film ''[[The Sting]]'' (1973) which features a conversation between the [[Robert Redford]] character and a woman he's attracted to played by [[Dimitra Arliss]] who says: \"I don't even know you': Redford's response: \"You know me. It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody\", caused an emotional response in Seger manifested in the overhauled song lyrics.<ref>''Detroit Free Press'' 18 October 1994 \"Rocker Tells the Stories Behind the Hits\" by Gary Graff p.3C</ref><ref>''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' 21 November 2011 \"Bob Seger Makes a Joyful Noise at Consol\" by Scott Mervis p.C-4</ref>\n\n\"We've Got Tonite\" was not recorded until the 1976 sessions for Seger's album ''Night Moves'' and was held off that album as Seger felt it was not a thematic fit.<ref>''Moline Dispatch'' 22 November 2009 \"Bob Seger Opens the Vaults for Disc of '70s Rarities\" p.G1</ref> One of five ''Stranger<span style=\"font-size:50%\">...</span>'' tracks recorded at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studios]] with the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]], \"We've Got Tonite\" served as the album's third single, reaching No. 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|US pop charts]] in 1978.

Both Rogers and Easton were on the roster of [[EMI America Records|EMI America]]-[[Liberty Records]] and their collaboration on \"We've Got Tonight\" was at the firm suggestion of label chairman Larry Mazza who hoped to restore Easton to chart ascendancy.<ref name=\"New Tomorrow\">''Los Angeles Times'' 11 September 1983 \"Sheena Easton's New Tomorrow\" by Dennis Hunt p.55 (Calendar)</ref> Mazza was also the president of [[Capitol Records]] the label of release for the [[Bob Seger]] original.<ref name=\"On Top Of It\">''Detroit Free Press'' 21 January 1983 \"On Top of It - Rogers, Easton Sing Song of Togetherness\" p.1C</ref> Rogers stated: \"I liked the idea of recording with Sheena. I thought the contrast in styles--I'm so throaty and she's so trained and pure--would really work well.\" -<ref name=\"On Top Of It\"/> Rogers himself phoned Easton to pitch their duet on 23 December 1982. The two singers then met up on Christmas Eve to rehearse the song with a piano, six days later going into the studio, with the completed track going to radio nine days after that.<ref>''Lansing State Journal'' 24 March 1983 \"Scottish Singer Zooming Down Road to Success\" by Jon Beam p.1D</ref>\n\nEaston would assert that it was the song choice which appealed to her, while allowing Rogers to be \"a good singer with a distinctive voice\" who she found \"always helpful and co-operative\" in the studio, debunking insider reports that the ten-day recording session for the track was a stormy one with Rogers overtly disliking Easton's high-pitched vocals.<ref name=\"New Tomorrow\"/> Easton's contribution to the track would prove a bone of critical contention: whereas ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic [[Chris Connelly (journalist)|Chris Connelly]] would dismiss the Easton/Rogers duet of \"We've Got Tonight\" as \"shrieking [and] insensitive\",<ref>''St Louis Post Dispatch'' \"Sheena Turns Up Flame\" by Christopher Connelly 3 March 1985 p.4G</ref> and ''Jerseyite'' critic Jim Bohen would lament how Rogers \"who usually sounds good duetting with women\" was defeated by \"Easton's [[chalkboard scraping|nails-across-the-blackboard]] voice\",<ref>''Daily Record'' 10 July 1983 \"Shortcuts\" by Jim Bohen p. D7</ref> Dennis Hunt (''Los Angeles Times'') would prefer the Rogers/Easton take to the Seger original due to a \"very appealing\" \"blend of sharply contrasting voices, his deep and hers very high\" adding that \"Rogers, never known for his vocal power, stretches to match Easton, [attaining] his finest vocal performance\",<ref>''Los Angeles Times'' 27 February 1983 \"The Record Rack\" by Dennis Hunt p.66 (Calendar)</ref> and [[AllMusic]] critic Joe Viglione would opine that Easton's \"splendid voice reaching the high registers over Kenny's familiar monotone<span style=\"font-size:50%\">...</span>really makes [the track] special.\"<ref>https://www.allmusic.com/song/weve-got-tonight-mt0035138724</ref>\n\nA number one hit on the [[Billboard Country Singles]] chart, \"We've Got Tonight\" reached number six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop singles chart, and number two on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Billboard Adult Contemporary]] chart, also reaching the top 30 in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"UK Singles\">[http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/kenny%20rogers/ Kenny Rogers UK Charts history], The Official Charts.

Seger overhauled \"This Old House\" into \"We've Got Tonite\" the day after seeing the film ''[[The Sting]]'' (1973) which features a conversation between the [[Robert Redford]] character and a woman he's attracted to played by [[Dimitra Arliss]] who says: \"I don't even know you': Redford's response: \"You know me.

The Principles were developed by former NYC Comptroller Harrison J.Goldin in the early 1980s.The Principles were endorsed by four well known Irish activists, two Catholic and two Protestants. Sean McBride (a founding member of Amnesty International) was one of the four and the Principles became known as the McBride Principles. The Principles not only became adopted by the NYC government but they were quickly adopted by States and localities across the country. Comptroller Goldin not only communicated with officials around the USA he visited Northern Ireland and Great Britain to meet with all sides in the dispute and to communicate the value of the Principles.They were promoted by [[Se\u00e1n McManus (priest)]] and the [[Irish National Caucus]], and by John Finucanne and the American Irish Political Education Committee (PEC).

The MacBride Principles certainly speeded the reform process in the 1980s, but it is debatable whether they contributed significantly after 1989. In a 2003 report the Irish National Caucus felt that the reforms had not yet achieved complete parity, emphasising that Northern Irish Catholics were still more likely to be unemployed and undereducated, and less likely to work in managerial positions, than other groups, and calling for [[affirmative action]] policies.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060519075847/http://www.irishnationalcaucus.org/pages/MacBride/IRRC%20Report%20on%20Fair%20Employment%20January%202003.htm INC report 2003]</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\nThe MacBride Campaign is conducted on a three-fold level:\n\n#Federal - The MacBride Principles became the law of the U.S. in October 1998. The U.S. House and Senate passed the MacBride Principles\u2014as part of the '''Omnibus Appropriations Act''' for Fiscal Year 1999\u2014and President Clinton signed them into law. The MacBride law mandates that recipients of U.S. contributions to the [[International Fund for Ireland]] (IFI) must be in compliance with the MacBride Principles. (The U.S. has been contributing about $19.6 million per year since 1986 to the IFI.)\n#State and Cities - Millions of dollars in state and city pension funds are invested in American corporations doing business in Northern Ireland. The MacBride Campaign lobbies to have legislation passed to direct these funds to be invested, in the future, only in companies that endorse the Principles (again, note, not divestment or disinvestments). This is the first step. The second step \u2014 once the MacBride Principles investment law has been passed \u2014 is to lobby cities and states to enact a \"selective purchasing\" law, barring the state or city from purchasing goods or services from companies in Northern Ireland that have not endorsed the Principles.\n#[[Shareholder resolutions]] - The Campaign works to have shareholders introduce and pass resolutions asking companies to endorse the Principles.\n\n==Endorsement==\nThe MacBride Principles have been passed in the following 18 US states:\n\n[[Connecticut]], [[Florida]], [[Illinois]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Kentucky]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Texas]], [[Vermont]] and [[California]].\n\nThey have also been passed or endorsed by over 40 cities, and are pending in many more. The following organizations or individuals have also endorsed them:\n\n* American Irish Political Education Committee\n* The Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]]\n* [[Randall Robinson]] of TransAfrica, the group that sponsored [[Nelson Mandela]]'s visit to the United States\n* Former New York State Governor [[George Pataki]]\n* Former New York State Governor [[Mario Cuomo]]\n* Former New York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]\n* Former New York City Mayor [[David Dinkins]]\n* Former Boston Mayor [[Raymond Flynn]] (and former Ambassador to the Vatican)\n* The AFL-CIO\n* The National Council of Churches\n* The American Baptist Convention\n* The Episcopal Church\n* The Lutheran Pension Board\n* The United Church of Christ Board of World Ministries\n* The United Methodist Church\n* some American Roman Catholic bishops\n* Virtually all Irish-American organizations.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\nSuggest add: Unpublished thesis by Kevin McNamara - listed in References of Wikipedia article on him, with link to this article.\n\n[[Category:Economy of Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Irish-American history]]\n[[Category:Employment discrimination]]\n[[Category:Foreign direct investment]]\n[[Category:Affirmative action]]\n", "text_old": "The '''MacBride Principles''' \u2014 consisting of nine [[Employment discrimination|fair employment]] principles \u2014 are a corporate code of conduct for [[United States]] companies doing business in [[Northern Ireland]] and have become the Congressional standard for all US aid to, or for economic dealings with, Northern Ireland.
