This was a triangular red flag with an elongated white cross.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\" caption= >\nDeutsche Geschichte5-230.jpg|The [[Battle of Arbedo]] (1422) as depicted in the [[Lucerne chronicle]] (1513).

Reinforcements of [[Schwyz]] are shown arriving in the top left, with a red triangular flag showing the white cross. <!--the troops of Milan are shown as fighting under a flag displaying a dog rampant holding the white-on-red cross of Savoy, presumably the coa of condottiere [[Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola]] (needs verification)-->\nCantonal flags Nancy 1477 1513.jpg|Ten cantonal war flags being carried in the [[Battle of Nancy]] (1477) in the depiction of the ''[[Luzerner Chronik]]'' of 1513.

In addition, the flags of Fribourg and Solothurn are shown, at the time not yet full members, who would join the confederacy in the aftermath of this battle. Each flag has the confederate cross attached.\n</gallery>\n\nThe white cross was thus in origin a field mark attached to combatants for identification, and later also to cantonal flags.\nThe [[Lucerne chronicle]] of 1513, in battle scenes of the [[Burgundy wars]] of the 1470s shows cantonal flags with an added white cross.\nIn this context, the solid-red war flag of Schwyz with the addition of the white cross appears much like the later flag of Switzerland.\nOther depictions in the [[Swiss illustrated chronicles|illustrated chronicles]] show a flag of Schwyz with an asymmetrical white cross, drawn in greater detail.\nThe symbol of the confederation as it developed during 1450-1520 was thus the white cross itself, not necessarily in a red field, but attached to existing flags, so that it appeared before a red background in those cantonal flags that contained red, notably the solid-red flag of Schwyz.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|{{FIAV|historical|}}War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'') during the 13th century\nFile:Ch-1422a.png|{{FIAV|historical|}}Triangular field ensign used by Swiss confederate forces from ca. the 1420s\nFile:Early Swiss cross.svg|{{FIAV|historical|}}Field ensign used from ca. 1470 and during the early 16th century\n</gallery>\n\n===Early modern===\n[[File:Patenpfennig Stampfer 1547 rev.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Stampfer]]'s depiction of the Swiss cross on the reverse of the ''Patenpfennig'' of 1547.]]\n[[File:Fahne Schweizergarderegiment Frankreich 1721.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of a member of the [[Swiss Guard#Swiss Guards in France|Swiss Guard in France]] with a flamm\u00e9 flag, showing the [[Colours, standards and guidons#France|French regimental white cross]] before a background of black, red, blue, and yellow flame designs]]\n\nThe first explicit mention of a separate flag representing the Confederacy dates to 1540, in the context of an auxiliary force sent by the Swiss to aid their associate, the city of [[Rottweil]], in a feud against the lords of [[Landenberg]].\nThe ''Tagsatzung'' decided that the Swiss auxiliaries sent to Rottweil should receive \"a red flag with a white upright cross\".\nThe first mention of the term ''Confederate Cross'' (''Eidgenossen Cr\u00fctz'') dates to 1533.<ref name=1889_633>[https://www.amtsdruckschriften.bar.admin.ch/viewOrigDoc.do?id=10014584 BBl 1889 IV] (12 November 1889), p. 633.</ref>\n\nBecause of the Swiss pledge of [[Swiss neutrality|neutrality]], there was no military conflict in which the Swiss confederate troops participated after 1540. Consequently, the confederate field sign fell out of use.\nAt the same time, the former field sign develops into a representation of the Confederacy during this time, without achieving the full status as official heraldic emblem.\nThe cross is shown as a symbol of the Swiss Confederacy on the ''Patenmedallie'' cast by [[Jacob Stampfer]] and given by the Confederacy as a baptismal gift to [[Claude of Valois|Princess Claude of France]] in 1547.\nThe cross appears on similar medals and on throughout the early modern period, but most symbolic depictions of the Confederacy in the 17th century do without the federal cross.\n\nBeginning in the later 16th century, forces of the individual cantons adopted a type of flag which was based on a white cross design. These flags usually showed a white cross drawn to the edge of the field in front of a background striped in the respective cantonal colours. From this type, the ''[[flamm\u00e9 (vexillology)|flamm\u00e9]]'' military flag develops in the 17th century, which also came to be used by [[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss mercenary]] regiments by the end of the 17th century.\nThe ''flamm\u00e9'' design remained popular for military flags of the 18th and 19th centuries. A ''flamm\u00e9'' flag was introduced as ordonnance for the Bernese troops in 1703.\n\n===Napoleonic period and Restored Confederacy===\n{{see|Coat of arms of Switzerland}}\n[[File:Swiss flag Bachmann 1815.png|thumb|150px|{{FIAV|historical|}}The first Swiss battalion flag, issued by the ''Tagsatzung'' on 12 October 1815, after the design of general [[Niklaus Franz von Bachmann]]]]\n\nAfter the invasion of 1798, the authorities of the [[Helvetic Republic]] confiscated all earlier flags, replacing them with the new green-red-yellow tricolour. \nGeneral [[Niklaus Franz von Bachmann]] used the white cross in a red field his campaigns of 1800 and 1815.\nThe term ''Schweizer-Fahne'' (later spelling ''Schweizerfahne'') is in use for the flag from this time, \nrecorded in a poem on the [[Battle of N\u00e4fels]] by one J.

In a first circular sent to the cantonal authorities, the flag was described as a red flag with a cross touching the edges, but in 1841, the Tagsatzung opted for a proposal by Carl Stauffer, which was announced to the cantons on 11 October 1841. The 1841 flag shows a bold cross suspended in the center of the square field. The proportions of the cross arm are 1:1, i.e. the cross is composed of five squares. The absolute width of the flag is given as 4.5 feet (105&nbsp;cm), that of the cross as 3 feet (90&nbsp;cm),<!--the Swiss \"foot\" (\"Schuh\") was defined as exactly 30 cm in 1835, the inch (\"Zoll\") as one tenth of a foot, so that 4'5\" = 4.5 feet, see [[:de:Alte_Masse_und_Gewichte_(Schweiz)#Das_Konkordat_von_1835]]-->\nfor a ratio of cross to flag width of 2:3 \u2248 66.7% (as opposed to the modern 5:8 = 62.5%).\n\nThe specifications include the flag pole and the ribbon with the cantonal colours attached to the pole (the example depicted is the flag of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]] battalion). The flag itself is described as of good [[silk]] cloth, four feet five inches squared, [[Scarlet (cloth)|scarlet]], in the center a white cross, arms measuring one foot by three feet.\n\n===Modern Switzerland===\nThe [[Swiss constitution]] of 1848 did not name a national flag, but it prescribes the federal flag for all federal troops.\nThe last ''flamm\u00e9'' flags still used by ''[[Landwehr]]'' units were replaced by the modern design in 1865.\nIn November 1889, the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] published a \"communication regarding the federal coat of arms\", detailing the history of the use of the Swiss cross since the 15th century.<ref>Botschaft des Bundesrates an die Bundesversammlung, betreffend das eidgen\u00f6ssische Wappen ([https://www.amtsdruckschriften.bar.admin.ch/viewOrigDoc.do?id=10014584 BBl 1889 IV 630], 12 November 1889)</ref>\n\nSeals produced from 1815 onward, and cantonal coins minted from 1826 showed the arms of the cross in the 7:6 length to width ratio. Later in the 19th century, there was a trend of depicting the cross as composed of five equal squares.\nThe two competing designs were controversially discussed in the late 19th century, especially after the introduction of the\nnew design for the [[Swiss coins|five franks coin]], which showed the [[Coat of arms of Switzerland|Swiss coat of arms]] in a [[Cartouche (design)|Baroque-style]] heraldic shield.\nThe Federal Council in 1889 introduced the 7:6 ratio as official. The associated communication explains that \n\"our heraldic cross is not a mathematical figure, but at the same the Christian cross symbol and the field sign of the Old Confederacy\". The 1889 law explicitly avoids specification of the shape of the shield, which was to be left to the \"tastes of the current time and practical necessity\".<ref name=1889_636>\"Wir haben uns bei dem nachstehenden Beschlussesvorschlag, der das Wappen der Eidgenossenschaft in unzweideutiger Weise festzustellen bestimmt ist, an das alte Herkommen gehalten, wonach\nunser Wappenkreuz nicht eine mathematische Figur, sondern das christliche Kreuzessymbol und zugleich das alteidgen\u00f6ssische Feldzeichen darstellt.\nBez\u00fcglich des Wappen Schildes, dessen Gestalt auf den neuen eidgen\u00f6ssischen F\u00fcnffrankenst\u00fccken allermeist zu der Kritik in der Tagespresse und so indirekt zu der Stellung Ihres Postulats die Veranlassung gegeben hat, ist es durchaus unthunlich, eine\noffizielle Form ein f\u00fcr alle Mal festzustellen.

This was a triangular red flag with an elongated white cross.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\" caption= >\nDeutsche Geschichte5-230.jpg|The [[Battle of Arbedo]] (1422) as depicted in the [[Lucerne chronicle]] (1513).

Reinforcements of [[Schwyz]] are shown arriving in the top left, with a red triangular flag showing the white cross. <!--the troops of Milan are shown as fighting under a flag displaying a dog rampant holding the white-on-red cross of Savoy, presumably the coa of condottiere [[Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola]] (needs verification)-->\nCantonal flags Nancy 1477 1513.jpg|Ten cantonal war flags being carried in the [[Battle of Nancy]] (1477) in the depiction of the ''[[Luzerner Chronik]]'' of 1513.

In addition, the flags of Fribourg and Solothurn are shown, at the time not yet full members, who would join the confederacy in the aftermath of this battle. Each flag has the confederate cross attached.\n</gallery>\n\nThe white cross was thus in origin a field mark attached to combatants for identification, and later also to cantonal flags.\nThe [[Lucerne chronicle]] of 1513, in battle scenes of the [[Burgundy wars]] of the 1470s shows cantonal flags with an added white cross.\nIn this context, the solid-red war flag of Schwyz with the addition of the white cross appears much like the later flag of Switzerland.\nOther depictions in the [[Swiss illustrated chronicles|illustrated chronicles]] show a flag of Schwyz with an asymmetrical white cross, drawn in greater detail.\nThe symbol of the confederation as it developed during 1450-1520 was thus the white cross itself, not necessarily in a red field, but attached to existing flags, so that it appeared before a red background in those cantonal flags that contained red, notably the solid-red flag of Schwyz.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|{{FIAV|historical|}}War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'') during the 13th century\nFile:Ch-1422a.png|{{FIAV|historical|}}Triangular field ensign used by Swiss confederate forces from ca. the 1420s\nFile:Early Swiss cross.svg|{{FIAV|historical|}}Field ensign used from ca. 1470 and during the early 16th century\n</gallery>\n\n===Early modern===\n[[File:Patenpfennig Stampfer 1547 rev.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Stampfer]]'s depiction of the Swiss cross on the reverse of the ''Patenpfennig'' of 1547.]]\n[[File:Fahne Schweizergarderegiment Frankreich 1721.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of a member of the [[Swiss Guard#Swiss Guards in France|Swiss Guard in France]] with a flamm\u00e9 flag, showing the [[Colours, standards and guidons#France|French regimental white cross]] before a background of black, red, blue, and yellow flame designs]]\n\nThe first explicit mention of a separate flag representing the Confederacy dates to 1540, in the context of an auxiliary force sent by the Swiss to aid their associate, the city of [[Rottweil]], in a feud against the lords of [[Landenberg]].\nThe ''Tagsatzung'' decided that the Swiss auxiliaries sent to Rottweil should receive \"a red flag with a white upright cross\".\nThe first mention of the term ''Confederate Cross'' (''Eidgenossen Cr\u00fctz'') dates to 1533.<ref name=1889_633>[https://www.amtsdruckschriften.bar.admin.ch/viewOrigDoc.do?id=10014584 BBl 1889 IV] (12 November 1889), p. 633.</ref>\n\nBecause of the Swiss pledge of [[Swiss neutrality|neutrality]], there was no military conflict in which the Swiss confederate troops participated after 1540. Consequently, the confederate field sign fell out of use.\nAt the same time, the former field sign develops into a representation of the Confederacy during this time, without achieving the full status as official heraldic emblem.\nThe cross is shown as a symbol of the Swiss Confederacy on the ''Patenmedallie'' cast by [[Jacob Stampfer]] and given by the Confederacy as a baptismal gift to [[Claude of Valois|Princess Claude of France]] in 1547.\nThe cross appears on similar medals and on throughout the early modern period, but most symbolic depictions of the Confederacy in the 17th century do without the federal cross.\n\nBeginning in the later 16th century, forces of the individual cantons adopted a type of flag which was based on a white cross design. These flags usually showed a white cross drawn to the edge of the field in front of a background striped in the respective cantonal colours. From this type, the ''[[flamm\u00e9 (vexillology)|flamm\u00e9]]'' military flag develops in the 17th century, which also came to be used by [[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss mercenary]] regiments by the end of the 17th century.\nThe ''flamm\u00e9'' design remained popular for military flags of the 18th and 19th centuries. A ''flamm\u00e9'' flag was introduced as ordonnance for the Bernese troops in 1703.\n\n===Napoleonic period and Restored Confederacy===\n{{see|Coat of arms of Switzerland}}\n[[File:Swiss flag Bachmann 1815.png|thumb|150px|{{FIAV|historical|}}The first Swiss battalion flag, issued by the ''Tagsatzung'' on 12 October 1815, after the design of general [[Niklaus Franz von Bachmann]]]]\n\nAfter the invasion of 1798, the authorities of the [[Helvetic Republic]] confiscated all earlier flags, replacing them with the new green-red-yellow tricolour. \nGeneral [[Niklaus Franz von Bachmann]] used the white cross in a red field his campaigns of 1800 and 1815.\nThe term ''Schweizer-Fahne'' (later spelling ''Schweizerfahne'') is in use for the flag from this time, \nrecorded in a poem on the [[Battle of N\u00e4fels]] by one J. Hottinger published in 1808.<ref>''Helvetischer Almanach f\u00fcr das Jahr 1809'' (Z\u00fcrich 1808), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=P6xOAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA194 p. 194]: \"So die Schweizer-Fahne: Weisses Kreuz in Roth.\"</ref>\n\n[[File:1batzvaud1829.jpg|thumb|Swiss cross on a ''[[Konkordatsbatzen]]'' (1829)]]\nThe [[Tagsatzung]] (Swiss Diet) re-introduced the white cross in the red field for the [[Coat of arms of Switzerland|seal of the Confederacy]] in 1814.\nThe commission for drafting a federal constitution on 16 May 1814 recommended the adoption of a seal of the Confederacy based on the \"field sign of the old Swiss\".<ref>Article 41 (of the draft constitution):\n\"Das Siegel der Eidgenossenschaft ist das Feldzeichen der alten Schweizer: ein wei\u00dfes freistehendes Kreuz im rothen Felde, sammt der Umschrift: Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft.\"</ref>\nOn 4 July 1815, the Diet accepted the design of the commission, adopted as the provisional seal\ndescribed as \"in the center, the federal red shield with the white cross as common federal heraldic emblem, surrounded by a simple circular Gothic ornament, on the outside of which the inscription 'Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft' with the year number MDCCCXV, and in an outer circle all XXII cantonal coat of arms in circular fields, according to their federal order of precedence; around all, a simple wreath\".<ref>\"In der Mitte der eidgen\u00f6ssische rothe Schild mit dem wei\u00dfen Kreuz als gemeineidgen\u00f6ssisches Wappenzeichen; ringsherum eine zirkelf\u00f6rmige einfache gothische Verzierung; au\u00dfer derselben die Inschrift: Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, mit der Jahreszahl MDCCCXV; in einem \u00e4u\u00dfern Zirkel alle XXII Kantonswappen in runden Feldern nach ihrer eidgen\u00f6ssischen Rangordnung, und das Ganze mit einem einfachen Siegelkranze in unterschobenen kleinen Bl\u00e4ttern geschlossen\" (Bd.

In a first circular sent to the cantonal authorities, the flag was described as a red flag with a cross touching the edges, but in 1841, the Tagsatzung opted for a proposal by Carl Stauffer, which was announced to the cantons on 11 October 1841. The 1841 flag shows a bold cross suspended in the center of the square field. The proportions of the cross arm are 1:1, i.e. the cross is composed of five squares. The absolute width of the flag is given as 4.5 feet (105&nbsp;cm), that of the cross as 3 feet (90&nbsp;cm),<!--the Swiss \"foot\" (\"Schuh\") was defined as exactly 30 cm in 1835, the inch (\"Zoll\") as one tenth of a foot, so that 4'5\" = 4.5 feet, see [[:de:Alte_Masse_und_Gewichte_(Schweiz)#Das_Konkordat_von_1835]]-->\nfor a ratio of cross to flag width of 2:3 \u2248 66.7% (as opposed to the modern 5:8 = 62.5%).\n\nThe specifications include the flag pole and the ribbon with the cantonal colours attached to the pole (the example depicted is the flag of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]] battalion). The flag itself is described as of good [[silk]] cloth, four feet five inches squared, [[Scarlet (cloth)|scarlet]], in the center a white cross, arms measuring one foot by three feet.\n\n===Modern Switzerland===\nThe [[Swiss constitution]] of 1848 did not name a national flag, but it prescribes the federal flag for all federal troops.\nThe last ''flamm\u00e9'' flags still used by ''[[Landwehr]]'' units were replaced by the modern design in 1865.\nIn November 1889, the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] published a \"communication regarding the federal coat of arms\", detailing the history of the use of the Swiss cross since the 15th century.<ref>Botschaft des Bundesrates an die Bundesversammlung, betreffend das eidgen\u00f6ssische Wappen ([https://www.amtsdruckschriften.bar.admin.ch/viewOrigDoc.do?id=10014584 BBl 1889 IV 630], 12 November 1889)</ref>\n\nSeals produced from 1815 onward, and cantonal coins minted from 1826 showed the arms of the cross in the 7:6 length to width ratio. Later in the 19th century, there was a trend of depicting the cross as composed of five equal squares.\nThe two competing designs were controversially discussed in the late 19th century, especially after the introduction of the\nnew design for the [[Swiss coins|five franks coin]], which showed the [[Coat of arms of Switzerland|Swiss coat of arms]] in a [[Cartouche (design)|Baroque-style]] heraldic shield.\nThe Federal Council in 1889 introduced the 7:6 ratio as official. The associated communication explains that \n\"our heraldic cross is not a mathematical figure, but at the same the Christian cross symbol and the field sign of the Old Confederacy\". The 1889 law explicitly avoids specification of the shape of the shield, which was to be left to the \"tastes of the current time and practical necessity\".<ref name=1889_636>\"Wir haben uns bei dem nachstehenden Beschlussesvorschlag, der das Wappen der Eidgenossenschaft in unzweideutiger Weise festzustellen bestimmt ist, an das alte Herkommen gehalten, wonach\nunser Wappenkreuz nicht eine mathematische Figur, sondern das christliche Kreuzessymbol und zugleich das alteidgen\u00f6ssische Feldzeichen darstellt.\nBez\u00fcglich des Wappen Schildes, dessen Gestalt auf den neuen eidgen\u00f6ssischen F\u00fcnffrankenst\u00fccken allermeist zu der Kritik in der Tagespresse und so indirekt zu der Stellung Ihres Postulats die Veranlassung gegeben hat, ist es durchaus unthunlich, eine\noffizielle Form ein f\u00fcr alle Mal festzustellen.

On [[Swiss National Day]], 1 August, the streets and buildings are traditionally festooned in celebration with Swiss flags and banners.\n\nProminent display of the Swiss flag on clothing and apparel has become more frequent with the \"Swissness\" fashion trend in the first decade of the 21st century, while such use of the flag had previously been largely limited to conservative and right-wing circles. The flag and coat of arms are also often used (frequently in contravention of federal law, see below) as design elements on merchandise, particularly on high-quality goods or on merchandise aimed at tourists; for example, the emblems of [[Victorinox]] and [[Wenger]], manufacturers of [[Swiss Army knives]] and the sole purveyors of these knives to the [[Swiss army]], are based on the Swiss coat of arms.\n\n===Official use===\nThe display of the flag on federal, cantonal and municipal public buildings follows no uniform pattern or regulation. Many public buildings are equipped with flag posts (most often one each for the federal, cantonal and municipal flag), but the flag(s) may only be flown during part of the year or only on National Day. In [[Bern]], the flag is flown on the cupola of the [[Federal Palace]] while the [[Swiss Federal Assembly|Federal Assembly]] is in session.\n\n===Legal protection===\nDestruction, removal or desecration of a Swiss, cantonal or municipal flag or coat of arms that has been installed by a public authority is punishable by a monetary penalty or imprisonment of up to three years according to the federal penal code.<ref>{{cite swiss law | sr = 311.0 | link = 311_0 | art = 270| date = | en = Swiss Penal Code | enab = | de = | deab = | fr = | frab = | it = |es = | esab = | itab = }}</ref> The destruction or desecration of privately owned flags is legal.\n\nThe use of the Swiss flag or coat of arms on merchandise is technically prohibited by the 1931 Federal Act for the protection of public coats of arms and other public insignia,<ref>{{cite swiss law | sr = 232.21 | link = 232_21 | art = | date = 5 June 1931 | en = | enab = | de = Bundesgesetz zum Schutz \u00f6ffentlicher Wappen und anderer \u00f6ffentlicher Zeichen | deab = | fr = | frab = | it = |es = | esab = | itab = }}</ref> but that prohibition is not enforced.\n\n==Influence==\n{{see also|Red Cross (symbol)#Relationship to the flag of Switzerland}}\n[[File:Flag of the Red Cross.svg|thumb|150px|Flag of the Red Cross]]\n\nThe [[Red Cross (symbol)|Red Cross symbol]] used by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], a red cross on white background, was the original protection symbol declared at the first [[Geneva Convention]], the [[Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field]] of 1864.
