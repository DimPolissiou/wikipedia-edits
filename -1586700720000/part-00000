significantly different from what prior opinion polling indicated. In comparison to the late-campaign polls, the AfD scored approximately 6% higher, while The Left and SPD each scored around 5% lower. The Left were expected to suffer only small losses, but instead achieved their worst result since 1990. This made AfD the clear second place finisher, in contrast to polling which predicted The Left would remain the second largest party. The SPD, who were already projected to achieve their worst ever result in the state, suffered a catastrophic result, losing over half their voteshare and barely reaching 10%. The Greens narrowly returned to the Landtag, while the FDP fell barely 1,600 votes short of the 5% threshold.

For a broad-based majority, the coalition would have needed to include both the CDU and The Left, which was infeasible.\n\nAnother possible option was a minority government \"tolerated\" by another party or parties which were themselves not part of the government. In this situation, these parties would abstain from the vote for Minister-President, allowing the minority government to be formed with a simple majority, rather than the typical absolute majority. Such a situation had existed in Saxony-Anhalt between 1994 and 2002, with an SPD minority government supported by The Left. The most likely arrangement in 2016 would have been a minority government of the CDU and SPD with the tolerance of the Greens and/or The Left. Similarly, a CDU\u2013Green coalition could have been tolerated by the SPD and/or The Left. An SPD\u2013Left\u2013Green coalition could be tolerated by the CDU, although this possibility was highly unlikely.<ref>{{cite news |title=German state elections: Success for right-wing AfD, losses for Merkel's CDU | url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-state-elections-success-for-right-wing-afd-losses-for-merkels-cdu/a-19113604.html |date= 2016-03-14}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the CDU, SPD, and Greens agreed to form a coalition government together, to the exclusion of The Left. This was dubbed the \"[[Black-red-green coalition|Kenya coalition]]\", a reference to the colours of the parties and those of the [[flag of Kenya]]. This was the first such coalition formed in Germany.

significantly different from what prior opinion polling indicated. In comparison to the late-campaign polls, the AfD scored approximately 6% higher, while The Left and SPD each scored around 5% lower. The Left were expected to suffer only small losses, but instead achieved their worst result since 1990. This made AfD the clear second place finisher, in contrast to polling which predicted The Left would remain the second largest party. The SPD, who were already projected to achieve their worst ever result in the state, suffered a catastrophic result, losing over half their voteshare and barely reaching 10%. The Greens narrowly returned to the Landtag, while the FDP fell barely 1,600 votes short of the 5% threshold. Minor parties performed better than expected, with 9% of votes going to them, compared to the 5\u20136% predicted.\n{{electiontable||editlink=no}}'''Summary of the 13 March 2016 election results for the [[Landtag of Saxony-Anhalt]]'''\n|-\n| colspan=8| [[File:Landtag of Saxony-Anhalt 2016.svg|center|350px]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Party\n!

For a broad-based majority, the coalition would have needed to include both the CDU and The Left, which was infeasible.\n\nAnother possible option was a minority government \"tolerated\" by another party or parties which were themselves not part of the government. In this situation, these parties would abstain from the vote for Minister-President, allowing the minority government to be formed with a simple majority, rather than the typical absolute majority. Such a situation had existed in Saxony-Anhalt between 1994 and 2002, with an SPD minority government supported by The Left. The most likely arrangement in 2016 would have been a minority government of the CDU and SPD with the tolerance of the Greens and/or The Left. Similarly, a CDU\u2013Green coalition could have been tolerated by the SPD and/or The Left. An SPD\u2013Left\u2013Green coalition could be tolerated by the CDU, although this possibility was highly unlikely.<ref>{{cite news |title=German state elections: Success for right-wing AfD, losses for Merkel's CDU | url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-state-elections-success-for-right-wing-afd-losses-for-merkels-cdu/a-19113604.html |date= 2016-03-14}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the CDU, SPD, and Greens agreed to form a coalition government together, to the exclusion of The Left. This was dubbed the \"[[Black-red-green coalition|Kenya coalition]]\", a reference to the colours of the parties and those of the [[flag of Kenya]]. This was the first such coalition formed in Germany. On 25 April 2016, Haseloff was re-elected as Minister-President by the Landtag on the second ballot, in which he won one vote more than the necessary majority.<ref name=\"faz2\">[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/magdeburg-haseloff-erst-im-zweiten-anlauf-wiedergewaehlt-14199099.html Haseloff erst im zweiten Anlauf wiedergew\u00e4hlt], [[Frankfurter Allgemeine]], in German</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wahlen.sachsen-anhalt.de/aktuelles/die-landeswahlleiterin-informiert/landtagswahl/ Saxony-Anhalt Electoral Office]\n\n{{Saxony-Anhalt state elections}}\n{{2016 elections in Germany}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saxony-Anhalt state election, 2016}}\n[[Category:2016 elections in Germany]]\n[[Category:Elections in Saxony-Anhalt|2016]]\n[[Category:March 2016 events in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Twotwofourtysix", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eParties", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Saxony-Anhalt_state_election"}

While ISRO has been researching for a Mars mission for many years, the project was only approved by the government in August 2012. ISRO took over a year to work on the spacecraft and bring the project to implementation stage. The Mars Orbiter Mission was launched on 5 November 2013 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, on the country's east coast. After travelling 670 million kilometres, ''Mangalyaan'' is now set to study the surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere to better understand the climate, geology, origin, evolution and sustainability of life on the planet. It is the most cost effective of all the missions sent to the planet by any other country costing India about $74 million.<ref name = \"Test\">{{cite web|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/science/news/isros-mars-orbiter-mission-beams-back-first-photos-597693 |title=Isro's Mars Orbiter Mission Beams Back First Photos &#124; NDTV Gadgets360.com |website=Gadgets.ndtv.com |date=2014-09-25 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}</ref>\n\n==Chandrayaan I & II==\n{{Main|Chandrayaan I|Chandrayaan II}}\nChandrayaan-1, was India's first mission to the Moon launched by India's national space agency, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The unmanned lunar exploration mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. India launched the spacecraft by a modified version of the PSLV C11 on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Nellore District, Andhra Pradesh about 80&nbsp;km north of Chennai at 06:22 IST (00:52 UTC). The mission was a major boost to India's space program, and India joined a band of Asian nations (China and Japan) in exploring the Moon. The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.\n[[File:Chandrayaan-1.svg|thumb|Image of the spacecraft.]]\nDuring the period 2004\u20132008, as the project director for Chandrayaan I, he led a team of engineers and scientists that designed and developed the project to carry instrumentation from ISRO and from NASA, ESA, and Bulgaria to accomplish simultaneous chemical, mineralogical, resource and topographic mapping of the entire lunar surface at high spatial and spectral resolutions. The project was realised within the time frame stipulated and the budget granted. He has paved the way for the future of Indian planetary missions and set an example for the international co-operation bringing the reputed international organisations like NASA, ESA, JAXA to work under the leadership of ISRO. Chandrayaan I has received many national and international awards including, the coveted Space Pioneers award for science and engineering at 28th International conference on Space development, in Florida USA in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/space-systems-award-for-chandrayaan/article15861.ece |title=Space Systems award for Chandrayaan |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=2009-09-06 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}</ref>\n\n2015 to 2018  Annadurai was heading ISRO Satellite Centre, Bangalore<ref>{{Citation|last=mylswamy annadurai|title=Mylswamy Annadurai \u2013 a brief history|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLSUgxm4eK0|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isac.gov.in/ |title=ISAC Homepage |website=Isac.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}</ref> as director.

While ISRO has been researching for a Mars mission for many years, the project was only approved by the government in August 2012. ISRO took over a year to work on the spacecraft and bring the project to implementation stage. The Mars Orbiter Mission was launched on 5 November 2013 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, on the country's east coast. After travelling 670 million kilometres, ''Mangalyaan'' is now set to study the surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere to better understand the climate, geology, origin, evolution and sustainability of life on the planet. It is the most cost effective of all the missions sent to the planet by any other country costing India about $74 million.<ref name = \"Test\">{{cite web|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/science/news/isros-mars-orbiter-mission-beams-back-first-photos-597693 |title=Isro's Mars Orbiter Mission Beams Back First Photos &#124; NDTV Gadgets360.com |website=Gadgets.ndtv.com |date=2014-09-25 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}</ref>\n\n==Chandrayaan I & II==\n{{Main|Chandrayaan I|Chandrayaan II}}\nChandrayaan-1, was India's first mission to the Moon launched by India's national space agency, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The unmanned lunar exploration mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor. India launched the spacecraft by a modified version of the PSLV C11 on 22 October 2008 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Nellore District, Andhra Pradesh about 80&nbsp;km north of Chennai at 06:22 IST (00:52 UTC). The mission was a major boost to India's space program, and India joined a band of Asian nations (China and Japan) in exploring the Moon. The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.\n[[File:Chandrayaan-1.svg|thumb|Image of the spacecraft.]]\nDuring the period 2004\u20132008, as the project director for Chandrayaan I, he led a team of engineers and scientists that designed and developed the project to carry instrumentation from ISRO and from NASA, ESA, and Bulgaria to accomplish simultaneous chemical, mineralogical, resource and topographic mapping of the entire lunar surface at high spatial and spectral resolutions. The project was realised within the time frame stipulated and the budget granted. He has paved the way for the future of Indian planetary missions and set an example for the international co-operation bringing the reputed international organisations like NASA, ESA, JAXA to work under the leadership of ISRO. Chandrayaan I has received many national and international awards including, the coveted Space Pioneers award for science and engineering at 28th International conference on Space development, in Florida USA in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/space-systems-award-for-chandrayaan/article15861.ece |title=Space Systems award for Chandrayaan |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=2009-09-06 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}</ref>\n\n2015 to 2018  Annadurai was heading ISRO Satellite Centre, Bangalore<ref>{{Citation|last=mylswamy annadurai|title=Mylswamy Annadurai \u2013 a brief history|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLSUgxm4eK0|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isac.gov.in/ |title=ISAC Homepage |website=Isac.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}</ref> as director.

Adding more valves increases valve area and improves the flow of intake and exhaust gases, thereby enhancing [[combustion]], [[volumetric efficiency]], and [[Engine efficiency|power output]]. Multi-valve geometry allows the spark plug to be ideally located within the combustion chamber for optimal flame propagation. Multi-valve engines tend to have smaller valves that have lower [[reciprocating mass]], which can reduce wear on each cam lobe, and allow more power from higher [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] without the danger of [[Valve float|valve bounce]]. Some engines are designed to open each intake valve at a slightly different time, which increases turbulence, improving the mixing of air and fuel at low engine speeds. More valves also provide additional cooling to the cylinder head. The disadvantages of multi-valve engines are an increase in manufacturing cost and a potential increase in oil consumption due to the greater number of valve stem seals. Some [[SOHC]] multi-valve engines (such as the [[Mazda B engine#B8|Mazda B8-ME]]) use a single fork-shaped rocker arm to drive two valves (generally the exhaust valves) so that fewer cam lobes will be needed in order to reduce manufacturing costs.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n{{anchor |Three-valve}}\n* '''Three-valve cylinder head'''\nThis has a single large exhaust valve and two smaller intake valves.  A three-valve layout allows better breathing than a two-valve head, but the large exhaust valve results in an RPM limit no higher than a two-valve head. The manufacturing cost for this design can be lower than for a four-valve design. The three-valve design was common in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and from 2004 the main valve arrangement used in [[Ford]] [[Ford F series|F-Series]] trucks, and Ford SUVs. The [[Ducati ST3]] [[V-twin]] had 3-valve heads.\n\n{{anchor |Four-valve}}\n* '''Four-valve cylinder head'''\nThis is the most common type of multi-valve head, with two exhaust valves and two similar (or slightly larger) inlet valves.  This design allows similar breathing as compared to a three-valve head, and as the small exhaust valves allow high RPM, this design is very suitable for high power outputs.\n\n{{anchor |Five-valve}}\n* '''Five-valve cylinder head'''\nLess common is the five-valve head, with two exhaust valves and three inlet valves.  All five valves are similar in size.  This design allows excellent breathing, and, as every valve is small, high RPM and very high power outputs are theoretically available.  Although, compared to a four-valve engine, a five-valve design should have a higher maximum RPM, and the three inlet ports should give efficient cylinder-filling and high gas turbulence (both desirable traits), it has been questioned whether a five-valve configuration gives a cost-effective benefit over four-valve designs. The rise of direct injection may also make five-valve heads more difficult to engineer, as the injector must take up some space on the head. After making five-valve [[Yamaha Genesis engine|Genesis engines]] for several years, [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] has reverted to the cheaper four-valve design, examples of the five-valve engines are the various 1.8l 20vT engines manufactured by AUDI AG, later versions of the [[Ferrari]] [[Ferrari Dino engine|Dino V8]] and the very rare 1.6l [[Toyota A engine#4A-GE (20-valve)|4A-GE]] engine of Toyota. \n\n{{anchor |Beyond}}\n* '''Beyond five valves'''\nFor a cylindrical bore and equal-area sized valves, increasing the number of valves beyond five ''decreases'' the total valve area. The following table shows the effective areas of differing valve quantities as proportion of cylinder bore.  These percentages are based on simple geometry and do not take into account orifices for spark plugs or injectors, but these voids will usually be sited in the \"dead space\" unavailable for valves.  Also, in practice, intake valves are often larger than exhaust valves in heads with an even number of valves-per-cylinder.\n\n* 2 = 50%\n* 3 = 64%\n* 4 = 68%\n* 5 = 68%\n* 6 = 66%\n* 7 = 64%\n* 8 = 61%\n\n=== Alternative technologies ===\n\n[[File:SUBARU EJ25 i-AVLS.jpg|thumb|Cutaway model of Subaru's [[Active Valve Control System|i-AVLS]] variable valve timing system on SOHC 4-valve-per-cylinder [[Subaru EJ engine|EJ25 boxer engine]] at Tokyo Motor Show 2007.]]\n[[Turbocharging]] and [[Supercharger|supercharging]] are technologies that also improve engine breathing, and can be used instead of, or in conjunction with, multi-valve engines. The same applies to [[variable valve timing]] and [[Intake manifold|variable intake manifolds]].

Its 7.6-litre monobloc straight-4 with modern hemispherical combustion chambers produced 148&nbsp;bhp (19.5 HP/Liter(0.32&nbsp;bhp per cubic inch)). In April 1913, on the Brooklands racetrack in England, a specially built L76 called ''\"la Torpille\"'' (torpedo) beat the world speed record of 170&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=\"KevinClemensDOHC\"/> Robert Peugeot also commissioned the young [[Ettore Bugatti]] to develop a GP racing car for the 1912 Grand Prix. This chain-driven [[Bugatti Type 18]] had a 5-litre straight-4 with SOHC and three valves per cylinder (two inlet, one exhaust). It produced appr. {{convert|100|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 2800 rpm (0.30&nbsp;bhp per cubic inch) and could reach {{convert|99|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The three-valve head would later be used for some of Bugatti's most famous cars, including the 1922 Type 29 Grand Prix racer and the legendary [[Bugatti Type 35|Type 35]] of 1924. Both Type 29 and Type 35 had a 100&nbsp;bhp 2-liter SOHC 24-valve NA straight-8 that produced {{convert|0.82|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} per cubic inch.\n\n=== Between 1914 and 1945 ===\n\n[[A.L.F.A. 40/60 GP]] was a fully working early racing car prototype made by the company now called [[Alfa Romeo]]. Only one example was built in 1914, which was later modified in 1921. This design of [[Giuseppe Merosi]] was the first Alfa Romeo [[DOHC]] engine.

The top speed of this car was 88-93&nbsp;mph (140\u2013149&nbsp;km/h). It wasn't until the 1920s when these [[DOHC]] engines came to Alfa road cars like the [[Alfa Romeo 6C]].\n\nIn 1916 US automotive magazine ''Automobile Topics'' described a four-cylinder, four-valve-per-cylinder car engine made by Linthwaite-Hussey Motor Co. of Los Angeles, CA, USA: ''\"Firm offers two models of high-speed motor with twin intakes and exhausts.\"''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_OMDAAAAMBAJ |title=Engines: A Century of Progress (Popular Mechanics, Jan 1985, pp. 95-97, 120, 122) |author=Mort Schultz |accessdate=2011-12-26 |date=January 1985 }}</ref>\n\nEarly multi-valve engines in [[T-head engine|T-head]] configuration were the 1917 ''Stutz'' straight-4 and 1919 ''Pierce-Arrow'' straight-6 engines. The standard [[Flathead engine|flathead]] engines of that day were not very efficient and designers tried to improve engine performance by using multiple valves. The [[Stutz Motor Company]] used a modified T-head with 16 valves, twin-spark ignition and aluminium pistons to produce 80&nbsp;bhp (59&nbsp;kW) at 2400 rpm from a 360.8 cid (5.8-liter) straight-4 (0.22&nbsp;bhp per cubic inch).

Robert M. Roof, the chief engineer for Laurel Motors, designed his multi-valve ''Roof Racing Overheads'' early in the 20th century. Type A 16-valve heads were successful in the teens, Type B was offered in 1918 and Type C 16-valve in 1923.

It produced appr. 30&nbsp;bhp (22.4&nbsp;kW) at 2700 rpm (15.4&nbsp;kW/liter or 0.34&nbsp;bhp/cid). In the 1920 Voiturettes Grand Prix at Le Mans driver Ernest Friderich finished first in a [[Bugatti Type 13]] with the 16-valve engine, averaging 91.96&nbsp;km/h. Even more successful was Bugattis clean sweep of the first four places at Brescia in 1921. In honour of this memorable victory all 16-valve-engined Bugattis were dubbed ''Brescia''.

The water-cooled engine featured four valves per cylinder and output a massive 196.2&nbsp;kW/liter. Porsche had to abandon its traditional aircooling because the multi-valve DOHC hampered aircooling of the spark plugs. Only two cars were built.\n\n[[Ferrari]] developed their ''Quattrovalvole'' (or QV) engines in the 80s. Four valves per cylinder were added for the 1982 [[Ferrari 308 GTB|308]] and [[Ferrari Mondial|Mondial]] ''Quattrovalvole'', bringing power back up to the pre-[[fuel injection|FI]] high of {{Convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} .

Any four-stroke [[internal combustion engine]] needs at least two valves per cylinder: one for ''intake'' of air (and often fuel<ref name=fuel/>), and another for ''exhaust''  of combustion gases.  Adding more valves increases valve area and improves the flow of intake and exhaust gases, thereby enhancing [[combustion]], [[volumetric efficiency]], and [[Engine efficiency|power output]]. Multi-valve geometry allows the spark plug to be ideally located within the combustion chamber for optimal flame propagation. Multi-valve engines tend to have smaller valves that have lower [[reciprocating mass]], which can reduce wear on each cam lobe, and allow more power from higher [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] without the danger of [[Valve float|valve bounce]]. Some engines are designed to open each intake valve at a slightly different time, which increases turbulence, improving the mixing of air and fuel at low engine speeds. More valves also provide additional cooling to the cylinder head. The disadvantages of multi-valve engines are an increase in manufacturing cost and a potential increase in oil consumption due to the greater number of valve stem seals. Some [[SOHC]] multi-valve engines (such as the [[Mazda B engine#B8|Mazda B8-ME]]) use a single fork-shaped rocker arm to drive two valves (generally the exhaust valves) so that fewer cam lobes will be needed in order to reduce manufacturing costs.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n{{anchor |Three-valve}}\n* '''Three-valve cylinder head'''\nThis has a single large exhaust valve and two smaller intake valves.  A three-valve layout allows better breathing than a two-valve head, but the large exhaust valve results in an RPM limit no higher than a two-valve head. The manufacturing cost for this design can be lower than for a four-valve design. The three-valve design was common in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and from 2004 the main valve arrangement used in [[Ford]] [[Ford F series|F-Series]] trucks, and Ford SUVs. The [[Ducati ST3]] [[V-twin]] had 3-valve heads.\n\n{{anchor |Four-valve}}\n* '''Four-valve cylinder head'''\nThis is the most common type of multi-valve head, with two exhaust valves and two similar (or slightly larger) inlet valves.  This design allows similar breathing as compared to a three-valve head, and as the small exhaust valves allow high RPM, this design is very suitable for high power outputs.\n\n{{anchor |Five-valve}}\n* '''Five-valve cylinder head'''\nLess common is the five-valve head, with two exhaust valves and three inlet valves.  All five valves are similar in size.  This design allows excellent breathing, and, as every valve is small, high RPM and very high power outputs are theoretically available.  Although, compared to a four-valve engine, a five-valve design should have a higher maximum RPM, and the three inlet ports should give efficient cylinder-filling and high gas turbulence (both desirable traits), it has been questioned whether a five-valve configuration gives a cost-effective benefit over four-valve designs. The rise of direct injection may also make five-valve heads more difficult to engineer, as the injector must take up some space on the head. After making five-valve [[Yamaha Genesis engine|Genesis engines]] for several years, [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] has reverted to the cheaper four-valve design, examples of the five-valve engines are the various 1.8l 20vT engines manufactured by AUDI AG, later versions of the [[Ferrari]] [[Ferrari Dino engine|Dino V8]] and the very rare 1.6l [[Toyota A engine#4A-GE (20-valve)|4A-GE]] engine of Toyota. \n\n{{anchor |Beyond}}\n* '''Beyond five valves'''\nFor a cylindrical bore and equal-area sized valves, increasing the number of valves beyond five ''decreases'' the total valve area. The following table shows the effective areas of differing valve quantities as proportion of cylinder bore.  These percentages are based on simple geometry and do not take into account orifices for spark plugs or injectors, but these voids will usually be sited in the \"dead space\" unavailable for valves.  Also, in practice, intake valves are often larger than exhaust valves in heads with an even number of valves-per-cylinder.\n\n* 2 = 50%\n* 3 = 64%\n* 4 = 68%\n* 5 = 68%\n* 6 = 66%\n* 7 = 64%\n* 8 = 61%\n\n=== Alternative technologies ===\n\n[[File:SUBARU EJ25 i-AVLS.jpg|thumb|Cutaway model of Subaru's [[Active Valve Control System|i-AVLS]] variable valve timing system on SOHC 4-valve-per-cylinder [[Subaru EJ engine|EJ25 boxer engine]] at Tokyo Motor Show 2007.]]\n[[Turbocharging]] and [[Supercharger|supercharging]] are technologies that also improve engine breathing, and can be used instead of, or in conjunction with, multi-valve engines. The same applies to [[variable valve timing]] and [[Intake manifold|variable intake manifolds]].

Its 7.6-litre monobloc straight-4 with modern hemispherical combustion chambers produced 148&nbsp;bhp (19.5 HP/Liter(0.32&nbsp;bhp per cubic inch)). In April 1913, on the Brooklands racetrack in England, a specially built L76 called ''\"la Torpille\"'' (torpedo) beat the world speed record of 170&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=\"KevinClemensDOHC\"/> Robert Peugeot also commissioned the young [[Ettore Bugatti]] to develop a GP racing car for the 1912 Grand Prix.

It produced appr. {{convert|100|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 2800 rpm (0.30&nbsp;bhp per cubic inch) and could reach {{convert|99|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The three-valve head would later be used for some of Bugatti's most famous cars, including the 1922 Type 29 Grand Prix racer and the legendary [[Bugatti Type 35|Type 35]] of 1924.

The BMW M88/3 engine was used in the 1983 [[BMW M6]]35CSi and in the 1985 [[BMW M5]].\n\nThe 1978 [[Porsche 935/78]] racer used a twin turbo 3.2-liter [[flat-6]] (845&nbsp;bhp/630&nbsp;kW@8,200 rpm; 784 Nm/578&nbsp;ft.lbs@6,600 rpm). The water-cooled engine featured four valves per cylinder and output a massive 196.2&nbsp;kW/liter. Porsche had to abandon its traditional aircooling because the multi-valve DOHC hampered aircooling of the spark plugs. Only two cars were built.\n\n[[Ferrari]] developed their ''Quattrovalvole'' (or QV) engines in the 80s. Four valves per cylinder were added for the 1982 [[Ferrari 308 GTB|308]] and [[Ferrari Mondial|Mondial]] ''Quattrovalvole'', bringing power back up to the pre-[[fuel injection|FI]] high of {{Convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} . A very unusual Dino Quattrovalvole was used in the 1986 [[Lancia Thema|Lancia Thema 8.32]]. It was based on the 308 QV's engine, but used a split-plane crankshaft rather than the Ferrari-type flat-plane. The engine was constructed by [[Ducati]] rather than Ferrari, and was produced from 1986 through 1991. The Quattrovalvole was also used by Lancia for their attempt at the [[World Sportscar Championship]] with the [[Lancia LC2|LC2]]. The engine was twin-turbocharged and destroked to 2.65&nbsp;litres, but produced {{Convert|720|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in qualifying trim.

The engine was based on the 2.3-liter 8-valve 136&nbsp;hp (101&nbsp;kW) unit already fitted to the 190- and E-Class series. [[Cosworth]] developed the DOHC light alloy cast cylinder head with four large valves per cylinder. In roadgoing trim, the 190 E 2.3-16 produced 49&nbsp;hp (36&nbsp;kW) and 41&nbsp;ft\u2022lbf (55 N\u2022m) of torque more than the basic single overhead cam 2.3 straight-4 engine on which it was based offering {{Convert|185|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}  at 6,200 rpm (59.2&nbsp;kW/liter) and {{Convert|174|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}  at 4,500 rpm. In 1988 an enlarged 2.5-liter engine replaced the 2.3-liter. It offered double valve timing chains to fix the easily snapping single chains on early 2.3 engines, and increased peak output by 17&nbsp;bhp (12.5&nbsp;kW) with a slight increase in torque. For homologation Evolution I (1989) and Evolution II (1990) models were produced that had a redesigned engine to allow for a higher rev limit and improved top-end power capabilities. The Evo II engine offered {{Convert|235|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}  from 2463 cc (70.2&nbsp;kW/liter).\n\n[[Saab Automobile|Saab]] introduced a 16-valve head to their 2.0-liter (1985 cc) straight-4 in 1984 and offered the engine with and without turbocharger (65.5&nbsp;kW/liter and 47.9&nbsp;kW/liter respectively) in the [[Saab 900]] and [[Saab 9000]].\n\nThe 2.0-liter Nissan [[Nissan FJ engine|FJ20]] was one of the earliest [[straight-4]] mass-produced Japanese engines to have both a DOHC 16-valve configuration (four valves per cylinder, two intake, two exhaust) and [[electronic fuel injection]] (EFI) when released in October 1981 in the sixth generation [[Nissan Skyline]]. Peak output was {{Convert|148|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000 rpm and {{Convert|133|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 4,800 rpm.

The cylinder head was developed by [[Yamaha Motor Corporation]] and was built at Toyota's Shimayama plant. While originally conceived of as a two-valve design, Toyota and Yamaha changed the 4A-GE to a four-valve after a year of evaluation. It produced 115-140&nbsp;bhp/86-104&nbsp;kW@6,600 rpm (54.2-65.5&nbsp;kW/liter) and 148 Nm/109 lbft@5,800 rpm. To compensate for the reduced air speed of a multi-valve engine at low rpm, the first-generation engines included the [[T-VIS]] feature.\n\nIn 1986 [[Volkswagen]] introduced a multi-valved [[Volkswagen Golf Mk2#Golf GTI & GTI 16v|Golf GTI 16V]].
