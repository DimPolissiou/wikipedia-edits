{"title_page": "Anti-sweatshop movement", "text_new": "'''Anti-sweatshop movement''' refers to campaigns to improve the conditions of workers in [[sweatshop]]s, i.e. manufacturing places characterized by low wages, poor working conditions and often [[child labor]]. It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.<ref name=\":4\">Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.</ref>\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>\"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8\". ''finduslaw.com''.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, \"like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 \"Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky\", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]</ref>  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.\n\nWith the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.<ref name=\":0\">Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. \"Workers of the world unite?

As of June 2018, 172 brands across 68 countries have revealed more information about their supply chains than in previous years. In response to the hashtag, #WhoMadeMyClothes, more than 3,838 global brands took to social media to respond with real information about their suppliers and workers.\n\n== Effectiveness of the movement ==\nA study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.<ref name=\":3\">Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. \u201cMovements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000\u201d.

Web.</ref>  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Debate on the effects of sweatshops ==\n\n=== Criticism ===\nThe criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, begins with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitative nature.<ref name=\":3\" /> Matt Zwolinski argues that though sweatshop laborers technically \"choose\" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not \"fully voluntary\" and that while sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker \"consents\" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that cause more harm than good to the laborer overall.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another criticism includes the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages. This often requires children to be taken out of school, thus disrupting their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that may endanger their health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arguments in favor ===\n==== Provision of opportunities ====\nSome people, such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f, argue that the anti-sweatshop movement \"risks harming the very people it is aiming to help.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html\n| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops\n| website = www.nytimes.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref> This is because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Effects on employment ====\nEven if a company does not move to another country with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good cost, the less the demand for it is. Economists argue that even though the labor is \"exploitative,\" it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.<ref>Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. \"The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment.\" ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.</ref>\n\n=== Views of economists ===\nMost economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external\u2019s point of view. An economist pointed out \u201cas simple as this: \u2018Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping, or you don\u2019t,\u2019 as a neoclassical colleague said to me.

It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.<ref name=\":4\">Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.</ref>\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>\"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8\". ''finduslaw.com''.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, \"like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 \"Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky\", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]</ref>  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.\n\nWith the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.<ref name=\":0\">Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. \"Workers of the world unite?

It occurred on the evening of 16&nbsp;July 2012 at a [[block party]] on Danzig Street in the [[West Hill, Toronto|West Hill]] neighbourhood of [[Toronto]]. Rival gang members Folorunso Owusu, 17, and Nahom Tsegazab, 19, along with an unidentified third gunman, opened fire in a crowd of two hundred people. This resulted in the deaths of Joshua Yasay and Shyanne Charles, and the injury of twenty-four others (including two of the perpetrators), making it the worst [[mass shooting]] in Toronto.<ref name=\"CommissoMurder\"/><ref name=\"DoucetteCharged\"/>\n\nA 2008 provincial report had warned of increasing trends in youth violence but key recommendations to help keep at-risk youth from joining gangs had not been adopted.<ref name=\"DiMuccioYear\"/><ref name=\"GallantAnti\"/> Around 2010 the West Hill-based Galloway Boys gang was reforming, recruiting youth<ref name=\"TorstarFight\"/> who obtained guns used in conflicts for territory and leadership.<ref name=\"HaLeadership\"/> Some of these youths held a party with free alcohol following a children's barbecue at a [[public housing|social housing]] complex.<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/> After a series of confrontations, threats escalated into the shooting.\n\nAlthough initially believed to be the resumption of a 2003 gang war between the Galloway Boys and the Malvern Crew, it later became clear that the Danzig Street shooting was not part of a territorial dispute or retaliation for another incident but a disagreement between teenagers who decided to have a gunfight in the middle of a party.<ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/> Police initially received few tips from frightened witnesses but were able to make two arrests that month; two additional arrests came following a reprisal shooting in September. The four young men convicted were aged 15 to 19 at the time of the shooting; two were minors and their names were withheld under the [[Youth Criminal Justice Act]] until they were sentenced as adults.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/><ref name=\"JanusSentenced\"/> Justice Ian Nordheimer said of the incident, \"Ordinary persons do not understand how anyone, much less teenagers, can come not only to possess such weapons, but to use them in such a brutal and indifferent way.\"<ref name=\"HashamSentenced\"/>\n\nThe incident made headlines around the world<ref name=\"NationalGalloway\"/><ref name=\"JohnsonGun\"/> and, in conjunction with the [[Toronto Eaton Centre#2012 shooting|Eaton Centre shooting]] six weeks earlier<ref name=\"PazzanoFinal\"/> and a [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|shooting in a Colorado movie theatre]] four days later,<ref name=\"JohnsonGun\"/> renewed debate on gun crime in urban areas.<ref name=\"GlobeAnswer\"/><ref name=\"GirouxAmerica\"/><ref name=\"TharoorLaws\"/> Despite falling national crime rates a poll taken the following week showed that a majority of Canadians were in fear of \"a violent crime wave\".<ref name=\"EdmistonAnxiety\"/> The shooting led the [[Toronto Police Service]] to develop new crime-prevention strategies for the Neighbourhood Officers program, established to build community relationships in at-risk areas to gain information on local crime, making possible targeted crackdowns on gang activity and a dramatic reduction in shootings and other crimes. Police 43&nbsp;Division (which includes Danzig Street) reported no homicides in 2013.<ref name=\"PalamarchukDivision\"/>\n\n==Background==\n\nThe [[Galloway Boys]] ({{a.k.a.}} G-Way) were one of the most notoriously violent criminal gangs in Toronto,<ref name=\"DoucetteGalloway\"/><ref name=\"NationalGalloway\"/> their turf centered on the intersection of Galloway and [[Kingston Road (Toronto)|Kingston Road]]s in the neighbourhood of [[West Hill, Toronto|West Hill]].<ref name=\"HaLeadership\"/> They terrorized [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] in 2003 and 2004 while battling with rival gang the [[Malvern Crew]] over territory for street drugs and prostitution.<ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/> The deadly turf war resulted in Ontario's largest street-gang crackdown and prosecutions,<ref name=\"TorstarFight\"/> with 75 arrests of alleged gang members on more than 600 criminal charges.<ref name=\"HalimGang\"/>\n\nWith the gang's leadership locked away, there was a dramatic decrease in violent crime. However, many of those gang leaders had been sentenced to five- or seven-year jail terms, and when they were released back into the community around 2010, they began mentoring youths recruited into the gang.<ref name=\"TorstarFight\"/> The younger members obtained guns and used them<ref name=\"DoucetteGalloway\"/> in conflicts for control of the gang and territory, resulting in a string of shootings and killings in 2011 and 2012.<ref name=\"HaLeadership\"/> By September 2012 there was a 22% increase in shooting incidents and a 41% increase in shooting victims in the city.<ref name=\"TorstarFight\"/>\n\nIn Toronto, blockos are a form of [[block party]] based on a tradition of outdoor gatherings in the [[West Indies]]. They are held by neighbours and outreach workers, particularly during the city's warm, humid summers. Daytime activities are focused on children, and the evenings provide an alternative for residents who cannot afford to go out to restaurants, clubs, etc. Since the 1970s many blockos have been held each year at [[Toronto Community Housing|Toronto Community Housing Corporation]] (TCHC) developments without incident.<ref name=\"VincentBlocko\"/>\n\nThe 101-unit townhouse [[public housing|social housing]] complex at Danzig Street and [[Morningside Avenue (Toronto)|Morningside Avenue]] is called Morningside Coronation by TCHC and D-Block by the young families that reside there.<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/> Alcohol is prohibited in common areas without a special-occasion permit.<ref name=\"VincentBlocko\"/> There is a strict no-gun policy: anyone caught with a gun is turned over to police, and tenants caught housing someone with a gun are evicted.<ref name=\"CouttsHousing\"/>\n\n==Event==\n\n===Block party===\nA blocko was organized at the Danzig Street housing complex for 15&nbsp;July 2012 by resident Shannon Longshaw, a 28-year-old mother of two, as an afternoon children's barbecue. Meanwhile, from 7&nbsp;July the Twitter account @2ToneShorty, linked to 19-year-old Nahom Tsegazab,<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/> a Galloway Boys member known as \"Gifted\",<ref name=\"ShumSentenced\"/> had been promoting the gathering as a \"HennessyBlock Party\". The messages promised a live DJ and 30&nbsp;bottles of [[Hennessy]] cognac on ice, free for all. Over the course of a week, more than two dozen open invitations were sent from the account and spread across social media as #hennessyblockparty.<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/><ref name=\"HaLeadership\"/> Some residents made Twitter posts expressing concerns over the potential for violence.<ref name=\"CTVWitnesses\"/>\n\nThe party, which was delayed to Monday 16&nbsp;July due to a rainstorm, began in Longshaw's backyard at 2&nbsp;pm. Tenants chipped in, provided food, and ran activities for area children<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/> such as face painting<ref name=\"MorrowRetaliation\"/> and putting a water sprinkler on playground equipment for a makeshift water slide.<ref name=\"VincentBlocko\"/> Tsegazab handed out school supplies and basketballs.<ref name=\"CherrySentenced\"/> The children's party was to end at 5&nbsp;pm, but by then adults were already gathering in the parking lot, and the Galloway Boys \"took ownership\" of the blocko. By 7&nbsp;pm the crowd had grown thicker and alcohol was being consumed to loud hip&nbsp;hop music. An hour later there were Jaguars and Hummers parked around the block, marijuana smoke in the air, and more than 200 people packing the complex's narrow internal lane<!--\"laneway\" in sources-->. Worried about people they did not know, some residents took their children inside their homes.<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/> One resident could not use the walkway without bumping into people, describing it as being like a jammed nightclub.<ref name=\"VincentBlocko\"/>\n\nSeveral noise complaints were made to police, and bicycle patrols were dispatched, but the party was allowed to continue.<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/> According to Gene Jones, then-CEO of TCHC, the event had not been sanctioned by TCHC and should have ended before 9&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"CouttsHousing\"/><ref name=\"CTVWitnesses\"/>\n\n===Provocations===\n\nThe crowd in the complex's lane was filling in when the Galloway Boys began \"G-checking\", confronting people they did not recognize and telling those from rival gang territories to leave.<ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/> 18-year-old Shaquan Mesquito of Malvern, an alleged Malvern Crew member known as \"Bam Bam\",<ref name=\"RushBam\"/> who had come to the party unarmed, was ordered to leave<ref name=\"PazzanoAlleged\"/> by Tsegazab's 15-year-old brother Naod.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> Naod threatened to shoot Mesquito if he did not leave immediately.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/><ref name=\"PazzanoAlleged\"/>\n\nAngry at being forced to leave, Mesquito sent out a number of Twitter posts<ref name=\"PazzanoAlleged\"/> urging others to go on a killing spree and shoot up the party.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> Shortly after 9&nbsp;pm, Nahom Tsegazab was warned about these threats. Tsegazab then armed himself with a .40&nbsp;calibre pistol and told others to be prepared for a possible shootout.<ref name=\"PazzanoAlleged\"/>\n\n===Shooting===\n\n17-year-old Folorunso Owusu, a Le Side Crew gang member<!--the gang's name is from the Chester Le Boulevard neighbourhood and TCHC complex-->,<ref name=\"PazzanoFinal\"/> arrived at the party and was confronted by Nahom Tsegazab, who displayed a handgun and challenged Owusu to fight if he did not leave. At approximately 10:40&nbsp;pm, less than two minutes after arriving at the party, Owusu opened fire and shot Nahom Tsegazab twice with a 9&nbsp;mm handgun.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> One of these bullets passed through Tsegazab and injured a bystander.<ref name=\"HashamPoster\"/>\n\nNahom Tsegazab was shot in the right biceps and abdomen. He fell to the ground in front of 207&nbsp;Danzig Street and reached for his gun, recklessly<!--this is from an agreed statement of fact at court--> firing eleven rounds at Owusu, who retreated through the crowd.<ref name=\"CherrySentenced\"/> One of these bullets struck Owusu in the leg.<ref name=\"HashamPoster\"/>\n\nA third shooter, who remains unidentified, fired fourteen rounds from an Uzi submachine-gun into the crowd.<ref name=\"MandelGuilty\"/>\n\nTwenty-four bystanders were shot, two fatally, and three people were trampled by the panicked crowd.<ref name=\"YuenComplex\"/> The shooting victims were aged 22&nbsp;months to 33&nbsp;years.<ref name=\"PostRetaliation\"/>\n\nShyanne Charles, 14, was fleeing from the initial gunfire when she ran into the line of fire of the third shooter. She was struck by several bullets and collapsed and died on the doorstep of 203&nbsp;Danzig Street.<ref name=\"CBCSentenced\"/>\n\nJoshua Yasay, 23, a community mentor with an honours degree in criminology who aspired to be a police officer,<ref name=\"DempseyFamily\"/> was shot by a bullet that pierced his heart and lungs.<ref name=\"MandelGuilty\"/> It has not been determined whether Tsegazab or the third shooter killed him.<ref name=\"CherrySentenced\"/>\n\nThe other shooting victims include:<!--All list entries must have a citation.

Two bullets were fired through the front window of the house where Mesquito lived with his mother<!--His mother's name is Nadine but she does not seem to have involvement in the incident and it doesn't seem necessary to state this-->. No one was injured.<ref name=\"RushSecond\"/>\n\nOn 19 July, while being treated at hospital, Nahom Tsegazab was charged with reckless discharge of a firearm in relation to the Danzig Street shooting.<ref name=\"MackraelCharged\"/> Mesquito was arrested on 27 July for two counts of uttering threats to cause serious bodily harm at the block party. At the time of his arrest, Mesquito was found carrying a loaded .22&nbsp;calibre revolver for which he was charged with nine weapons-related offenses. Later that summer Mesquito's family were evicted by TCHC for a lease violation, possibly stemming from these charges.<ref name=\"RushSecond\"/><ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/>\n\nIn the search for gunmen, police executed a series of vehicle inspections, checks on parolees, and search warrants in the week of 29 July&nbsp;&ndash; 4&nbsp;August, during the course of which over twenty firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition were seized.<ref name=\"DoucetteSeize\"/> There were concerns about violence during the 4&nbsp;August [[Caribana]] parade, which attracts one million people,<ref name=\"QMIAlleged\"/> and which had been the site of a fatal shooting in 2011.<ref name=\"HannayCaribbean\"/>\n\n===Social media===\n\nInitial reports from the shooting came via Twitter posts from witnesses and victims.<ref name=\"LearnKnow\"/> Within hours of the shooting, Twitter was flooded with posts referencing \"Ledda\" in connection with 14-year-old victim Shyanne Charles, warning that Ledda would seek out those responsible for the violence.<ref name=\"CTVRelative\"/> \"This is just the beginning. Touched the wrong people,\" read another message. Police also looked into whether a rap video posted two days before the shooting may have been related.<ref name=\"CTVWitnesses\"/><ref name=\"DoucetteLawrence\"/> As part of the investigation, police went through thousands of text messages and intercepted phone calls to rebuild the sequence of events. Among these messages were several in which Mesquito claimed responsibility for the shooting.<ref name=\"FreemanDropped\"/>\n\n==Investigation and later arrests==\n\nPolice were met with silence in many areas as they asked for witnesses to come forward,<ref name=\"LoriggioAppeal\"/> receiving few tips despite so many people having been witnesses to, or victims of, the events. The investigation gained momentum within a few weeks<ref name=\"ApplebyShot\"/> while the Summer Safety Initiative was launched to confront gangs and violence,<ref name=\"DoucetteTAVIS\"/> putting officers on foot patrol in high-crime areas. Officers built relationships with residents of these communities, where some had a historic distrust of police and fears of gang retaliation.<ref name=\"DempseyCrime\"/>\n\nA related shooting occurred on 2 September at a TCHC townhouse complex on Chester&nbsp;Le Boulevard. Naod Tsegazab had tracked down Owusu to retaliate for trying to kill his brother, Nahom. However, Naod only shot Owusu once in the leg before his gun jammed. As a result of the shooting, a search warrant was carried out on Owusu's Chester&nbsp;Le Boulevard home, leading to cocaine trafficking charges.<ref name=\"CherryCharges\"/> Naod was charged with the attempted murder of Owusu.<ref name=\"TorstarCharges\"/>\n\nThe first murder charge of the Danzig Street shooting investigation was made against Mesquito on 7&nbsp;November. He was charged with the attempted murder of Nahom Tsegazab, two counts of first-degree murder and 23 counts of aggravated assault.<ref name=\"CommissoMurder\"/> Later that month Nahom Tsegazab was charged with two counts of second-degree murder and 22 counts of aggravated assault.<ref name=\"OTooleBoy\"/><ref name=\"CBCCharged\"/> Owusu was arraigned with similar charges at the end of November.<ref name=\"TorstarCharges\"/> As the fourth person charged in connection with the Danzig Street shooting, Naod was charged on 4&nbsp;December with threatening death and weapons offenses but not murder.<ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/>\n\nOn 23 January 2015 the murder and assault charges against Mesquito were dropped after police uncovered evidence that he was in an apartment building {{convert|9|km}} away at the time of the shooting. Mesquito had continued to claim credit for the shooting throughout the 30&nbsp;months he was in custody. His lawyer suggested that since Mesquito had called for people to shoot up the party, he may have thought people close to him had done it and so took responsibility. In fact, no connection was found between Mesquito and Owusu, who had initiated the shooting. The defense lawyer praised police and the Crown Attorney, and stated that he had never before been involved in a case where law enforcement, the prosecution, and the defence had worked together to uncover the facts.<ref name=\"FreemanDropped\"/>\n\n==Convictions==\n\nNahom Tsegazab pleaded guilty on 11&nbsp;April 2014<ref name=\"CanadianGuilty\"/> to two counts of manslaughter and six counts of aggravated assault, and was sentenced to fourteen years in prison.<ref name=\"CBCSentenced\"/><ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> Tsegazab admitted that in participating in the gunfight he was a party to all the deaths and injuries that ensued.<ref name=\"MandelGuilty\"/>\n\nShaquan Mesquito pleaded guilty on 23&nbsp;January 2015 to counselling to commit murder, possession of a firearm, breach of a prohibition order, and uttering a threat. He was sentenced to nine years in prison (less time served).<ref name=\"CanadianDropped\"/> Although no connection was found to link Mesquito with Owusu, it was determined that Mesquito's threats to revisit the block party and \"shoot it up\" had put the Galloway Boys on a \"hair trigger\".<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/>\n\nNaod Tsegazab pleaded guilty in 2016 to the attempted murder of Owusu in the 2&nbsp;September Chester&nbsp;Le Boulevard shooting, carried out in the belief that Owusu had shot his brother. He was sentenced as an adult to seven years in prison.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/>\n\nFolorunso Owusu pleaded not guilty to two counts of second-degree murder, one count of attempted murder against Nahom Tsezagab, two counts of aggravated assault, and one charge of reckless discharging of a firearm.<ref name=\"PazzanoAlleged\"/> The defence maintained during the seven-week trial that Owusu was innocent and a victim of circumstance, shot while attending the party.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> The Crown provided a recording of Naod Tsegazab in the courthouse cells identifying Owusu, by nickname, as his brother's shooter. However, Naod testified that he invented the story to look tougher in jail, and Nahom Tsegazab testified that Owusu did not shoot him.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> Found guilty, Owusu was sentenced as an adult to [[Life imprisonment in Canada|life in prison]] on 7&nbsp;December 2016.<ref name=\"JanusSentenced\"/> None of the bullets Owusu fired had killed anyone, but his actions had initiated the gunfire that killed two and injured twenty-two bystanders.<ref name=\"PazzanoAlleged\"/> In May 2017 Owusu was found guilty of criminal negligence charges,<ref name=\"PazzanoFinal\"/> which had been severed in a pre-trial motion,<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> and sentenced to four years, to be served concurrently with the life sentence. With time served, he is eligible for [[Parole#Canada|parole]] in 2019.<ref name=\"PazzanoFinal\"/>\n\n==Effects==\n\n===Crime and policing===\nThe 16 July Danzig Street shooting was the worst [[mass shooting]] in Toronto,<ref name=\"CommissoMurder\"/><ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/> and occurred just six weeks after the [[Toronto Eaton Centre#2012 shooting|Eaton Centre shooting]].<ref name=\"PazzanoFinal\"/> The event made headlines around the world<ref name=\"NationalGalloway\"/> and prompted renewed debate on gun crime in urban areas. Two other deadly shooting incidents in the city followed within three days,<ref name=\"KitchingCharge\"/><ref name=\"MackraelCharged\"/> and three shootings occurred that Friday night.<ref name=\"CTVShootings\"/> That same evening a lone gunman [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|opened fire in a Colorado movie theatre]], killing twelve.<ref name=\"JohnsonGun\"/>\n\nAlthough data showed crime was decreasing nationally, a 25\u201326 July Forum Research poll for the ''[[National Post]]'' suggested that Canadians believed otherwise. The recent mass shootings and media coverage had a majority fearing \"a violent crime wave\". Pamela Rutledge, a media researcher studying the psychological impact of news coverage, stated that the apparent randomness of the crimes could lead to this perception. \"They really trigger a sense of fear in us because they aren't explainable [...] There's no way of making sense of it or figuring out why it didn't happen to me. So that anxiety accelerates your sense of danger.\"<ref name=\"EdmistonAnxiety\"/>\n\nThe [[Toronto Police Service]] established a strong uniform presence at Danzig Street, Kingston\u2013Galloway, and other areas that struggle with gang violence, in an attempt to stop acts of revenge.<ref name=\"CTVWitnesses\"/> This was extended with the Summer Safety Initiative, a seven-week program of mandatory overtime that effectively added more than 300 officers to patrols. The program emphasized \"old-school policing\", with officers walking street patrols in high-crime areas, building relationships with residents and the community. During these summer weeks, which typically see a spike in shootings and other crime, shooting deaths declined from a seven-year average of 6.4 to 2,<ref name=\"GillisCrime\"/> with dramatic drops in other violent crime categories. The initiative cost $2&nbsp;million, though Police Chief Bill Blair said it saved money by preventing crimes that are expensive to investigate.<ref name=\"DempseyCrime\"/>\n\nThe 2012 Summer Safety Initiative led to crime-prevention strategies and the development in 2013 of the Neighbourhood Officers program, which focuses on high-crime areas in each of Toronto's seventeen police divisions. In the program, officers are dedicated to a specific area for a period of at least two years, shifting away from enforcement-based policing to building relationships with residents, learning of specific issues affecting the communities, and improving intelligence about local crime.<ref name=\"GillisCrime\"/> The provincially-funded TAVIS (Toronto Anti-violence Intervention Strategy) program saw a similar shift in focus, having faced controversy for a practice of stopping, questioning, and documenting people&nbsp;&ndash; a procedure known as \"carding\"&nbsp;&ndash; which resulted in community distrust.<ref name=\"GillisCrime\"/>\n\nThe shooting brought an offer from Customs and Immigration officers to patrol with Toronto Police in hunts for gunmen. A liaison officer was established so police could quickly obtain immigration information on suspects.

Project Brazen was carried out from April to September 2012, resulting in nine arrests, the seizure of five firearms, and attempted murder charges for four shootings. Homicide detectives and officers from Scarborough divisions reviewed the evidence and launched Project Quell in June 2013, identifying seven members of the Orton Park Boys and twenty-five members of the Galloway Boys, charging them with a total of 363 offenses. Search warrants were executed on 3&nbsp;October in Toronto, [[London, Ontario|London]], and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], seizing more than {{convert|1|kg}} of cocaine and $10,000 in drug proceeds.<ref name=\"KitchingGangs\"/><ref name=\"HalimGang\"/>\n\nProject Quell officers confirmed that the Danzig Street investigation triggered investigations into the Galloway Boys and Orton Park.<ref name=\"HalimGang\"/>\n\n===Social programs===\n\nThe Danzig Street shooting brought renewed attention to the report ''Roots of Youth Violence'' commissioned by the Ontario Liberal government following a fatal Toronto high school shooting in 2007. The report warned of \"deeply troubling\" increases in the frequency and severity of youth violence, and addressed children's mental health issues, poverty, racism, education, family issues, the justice system, and a lack of voice for youth. In August 2012 the Liberal government incorporated some of the recommendations in a $20&nbsp;million action plan to curb youth violence.<ref name=\"DiMuccioYear\"/>\n\nNigerian-born businessman Akanimo Udofiya donated $150,000 over three years to help fund Our&nbsp;Space, a community drop-in centre established in a formerly vacant townhouse at 230 Danzig Street.

And I'm not going to stop. Not put 'em in jail, then come back and you can live in the city. No. I want 'em out of the city. Go somewhere else. I don't want 'em living in the city anymore.\"<ref name=\"FordQuotes\"/> The day after the shooting, he added, \"We must use every legal means to make life for these thugs miserable, to put them behind bars, or to run them out of town. We will not rest until being a gang member is a miserable, undesirable life.\"<ref name=\"KuitenbrouwerTracks\"/> Ford called for longer prison sentences and decried \"hug a thug\" social programs, voting against accepting federal grants worth more than $16&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"GrantGuns\"/>\n\nIn 2013 Ford was the subject of a video scandal<ref name=\"StarCrack\"/><ref name=\"DenetteConnecting\"/> and admitted to smoking crack cocaine and associating with drug dealers.<ref name=\"BruserCrack\"/> While [[2014 Toronto mayoral election|campaigning for re-election]] in 2014, Ford visited Danzig Street on the second anniversary of the mass shooting, dodging questions about his own connection to drug dealers. Councillor Paula Fletcher criticized his attending the event: \"You can't have it both ways&nbsp;\u2013 you can't be part of it and then crusading to stop it ... You can't technically be condoning guns and gangs and then going out saying how terrible it is that people have been shot and killed.\"<ref name=\"JeffordsFord\"/>\n\n===In media===\n\nToronto Police Sergeant Rod Chung collaborated with local hip hop artist [[Promise (rapper)|Promise]] to reach out to urban youth. With help from artists Kaid and Liya, they released a track titled \"Make a Change\", inspired by the Danzig Street shooting. Promise wrote the lyrics, which call for taking ownership of the city and an end to violence. The track premiered on 30&nbsp;September 2012 on [[CKFG-FM]], a black owned and operated commercial radio station, which hosted an on-air town hall meeting to continue discussions between the community, artists, and the police.<ref name=\"DaubsPromise\"/>\n\nThe day after the Danzig Street shooting, Toronto-born rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] tweeted his condolences to the families of Yasay and Charles.<ref name=\"DaubsDrake\"/> He rapped about this \"one summer day that went horribly wrong\" as a featured artist on Snoop Dogg's reggae track \"[[No Guns Allowed]]\":<ref

It occurred on the evening of 16&nbsp;July 2012 at a [[block party]] on Danzig Street in the [[West Hill, Toronto|West Hill]] neighbourhood of [[Toronto]]. Rival gang members Folorunso Owusu, 17, and Nahom Tsegazab, 19, along with an unidentified third gunman, opened fire in a crowd of two hundred people. This resulted in the deaths of Joshua Yasay and Shyanne Charles, and the injury of twenty-four others (including two of the perpetrators), making it the worst [[mass shooting]] in Toronto.<ref name=\"CommissoMurder\"/><ref name=\"DoucetteCharged\"/>\n\nA 2008 provincial report had warned of increasing trends in youth violence but key recommendations to help keep at-risk youth from joining gangs had not been adopted.<ref name=\"DiMuccioYear\"/><ref name=\"GallantAnti\"/> Around 2010 the West Hill-based Galloway Boys gang was reforming, recruiting youth<ref name=\"TorstarFight\"/> who obtained guns used in conflicts for territory and leadership.<ref name=\"HaLeadership\"/> Some of these youths held a party with free alcohol following a children's barbecue at a [[public housing|social housing]] complex.<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/> After a series of confrontations, threats escalated into the shooting.\n\nAlthough initially believed to be the resumption of a 2003 gang war between the Galloway Boys and the Malvern Crew, it later became clear that the Danzig Street shooting was not part of a territorial dispute or retaliation for another incident but a disagreement between teenagers who decided to have a gunfight in the middle of a party.<ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/> Police initially received few tips from frightened witnesses but were able to make two arrests that month; two additional arrests came following a reprisal shooting in September. The four young men convicted were aged 15 to 19 at the time of the shooting; two were minors and their names were withheld under the [[Youth Criminal Justice Act]] until they were sentenced as adults.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/><ref name=\"JanusSentenced\"/> Justice Ian Nordheimer said of the incident, \"Ordinary persons do not understand how anyone, much less teenagers, can come not only to possess such weapons, but to use them in such a brutal and indifferent way.\"<ref name=\"HashamSentenced\"/>\n\nThe incident made headlines around the world<ref name=\"NationalGalloway\"/><ref name=\"JohnsonGun\"/> and, in conjunction with the [[Toronto Eaton Centre#2012 shooting|Eaton Centre shooting]] six weeks earlier<ref name=\"PazzanoFinal\"/> and a [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|shooting in a Colorado movie theatre]] four days later,<ref name=\"JohnsonGun\"/> renewed debate on gun crime in urban areas.<ref name=\"GlobeAnswer\"/><ref name=\"GirouxAmerica\"/><ref name=\"TharoorLaws\"/> Despite falling national crime rates a poll taken the following week showed that a majority of Canadians were in fear of \"a violent crime wave\".<ref name=\"EdmistonAnxiety\"/> The shooting led the [[Toronto Police Service]] to develop new crime-prevention strategies for the Neighbourhood Officers program, established to build community relationships in at-risk areas to gain information on local crime, making possible targeted crackdowns on gang activity and a dramatic reduction in shootings and other crimes. Police 43&nbsp;Division (which includes Danzig Street) reported no homicides in 2013.<ref name=\"PalamarchukDivision\"/>\n\n==Background==\n\nThe [[Galloway Boys]] ({{a.k.a.}} G-Way) were one of the most notoriously violent criminal gangs in Toronto,<ref name=\"DoucetteGalloway\"/><ref name=\"NationalGalloway\"/> their turf centered on the intersection of Galloway and [[Kingston Road (Toronto)|Kingston Road]]s in the neighbourhood of [[West Hill, Toronto|West Hill]].<ref name=\"HaLeadership\"/> They terrorized [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] in 2003 and 2004 while battling with rival gang the [[Malvern Crew]] over territory for street drugs and prostitution.<ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/> The deadly turf war resulted in Ontario's largest street-gang crackdown and prosecutions,<ref name=\"TorstarFight\"/> with 75 arrests of alleged gang members on more than 600 criminal charges.<ref name=\"HalimGang\"/>\n\nWith the gang's leadership locked away, there was a dramatic decrease in violent crime. However, many of those gang leaders had been sentenced to five- or seven-year jail terms, and when they were released back into the community around 2010, they began mentoring youths recruited into the gang.<ref name=\"TorstarFight\"/> The younger members obtained guns and used them<ref name=\"DoucetteGalloway\"/> in conflicts for control of the gang and territory, resulting in a string of shootings and killings in 2011 and 2012.<ref name=\"HaLeadership\"/> By September 2012 there was a 22% increase in shooting incidents and a 41% increase in shooting victims in the city.<ref name=\"TorstarFight\"/>\n\nIn Toronto, blockos are a form of [[block party]] based on a tradition of outdoor gatherings in the [[West Indies]]. They are held by neighbours and outreach workers, particularly during the city's warm, humid summers. Daytime activities are focused on children, and the evenings provide an alternative for residents who cannot afford to go out to restaurants, clubs, etc. Since the 1970s many blockos have been held each year at [[Toronto Community Housing|Toronto Community Housing Corporation]] (TCHC) developments without incident.<ref name=\"VincentBlocko\"/>\n\nThe 101-unit townhouse [[public housing|social housing]] complex at Danzig Street and [[Morningside Avenue (Toronto)|Morningside Avenue]] is called Morningside Coronation by TCHC and D-Block by the young families that reside there.<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/> Alcohol is prohibited in common areas without a special-occasion permit.<ref name=\"VincentBlocko\"/> There is a strict no-gun policy: anyone caught with a gun is turned over to police, and tenants caught housing someone with a gun are evicted.<ref name=\"CouttsHousing\"/>\n\n==Event==\n\n===Block party===\nA blocko was organized at the Danzig Street housing complex for 15&nbsp;July 2012 by resident Shannon Longshaw, a 28-year-old mother of two, as an afternoon children's barbecue. Meanwhile, from 7&nbsp;July the Twitter account @2ToneShorty, linked to 19-year-old Nahom Tsegazab,<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/> a Galloway Boys member known as \"Gifted\",<ref name=\"ShumSentenced\"/> had been promoting the gathering as a \"HennessyBlock Party\". The messages promised a live DJ and 30&nbsp;bottles of [[Hennessy]] cognac on ice, free for all. Over the course of a week, more than two dozen open invitations were sent from the account and spread across social media as #hennessyblockparty.<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/><ref name=\"HaLeadership\"/> Some residents made Twitter posts expressing concerns over the potential for violence.<ref name=\"CTVWitnesses\"/>\n\nThe party, which was delayed to Monday 16&nbsp;July due to a rainstorm, began in Longshaw's backyard at 2&nbsp;pm. Tenants chipped in, provided food, and ran activities for area children<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/> such as face painting<ref name=\"MorrowRetaliation\"/> and putting a water sprinkler on playground equipment for a makeshift water slide.<ref name=\"VincentBlocko\"/> Tsegazab handed out school supplies and basketballs.<ref name=\"CherrySentenced\"/> The children's party was to end at 5&nbsp;pm, but by then adults were already gathering in the parking lot, and the Galloway Boys \"took ownership\" of the blocko. By 7&nbsp;pm the crowd had grown thicker and alcohol was being consumed to loud hip&nbsp;hop music. An hour later there were Jaguars and Hummers parked around the block, marijuana smoke in the air, and more than 200 people packing the complex's narrow internal lane<!--\"laneway\" in sources-->. Worried about people they did not know, some residents took their children inside their homes.<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/> One resident could not use the walkway without bumping into people, describing it as being like a jammed nightclub.<ref name=\"VincentBlocko\"/>\n\nSeveral noise complaints were made to police, and bicycle patrols were dispatched, but the party was allowed to continue.<ref name=\"YangShootings\"/> According to Gene Jones, then-CEO of TCHC, the event had not been sanctioned by TCHC and should have ended before 9&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"CouttsHousing\"/><ref name=\"CTVWitnesses\"/>\n\n===Provocations===\n\nThe crowd in the complex's lane was filling in when the Galloway Boys began \"G-checking\", confronting people they did not recognize and telling those from rival gang territories to leave.<ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/> 18-year-old Shaquan Mesquito of Malvern, an alleged Malvern Crew member known as \"Bam Bam\",<ref name=\"RushBam\"/> who had come to the party unarmed, was ordered to leave<ref name=\"PazzanoAlleged\"/> by Tsegazab's 15-year-old brother Naod.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> Naod threatened to shoot Mesquito if he did not leave immediately.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/><ref name=\"PazzanoAlleged\"/>\n\nAngry at being forced to leave, Mesquito sent out a number of Twitter posts<ref name=\"PazzanoAlleged\"/> urging others to go on a killing spree and shoot up the party.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> Shortly after 9&nbsp;pm, Nahom Tsegazab was warned about these threats. Tsegazab then armed himself with a .40&nbsp;calibre pistol and told others to be prepared for a possible shootout.<ref name=\"PazzanoAlleged\"/>\n\n===Shooting===\n\n17-year-old Folorunso Owusu, a Le Side Crew gang member<!--the gang's name is from the Chester Le Boulevard neighbourhood and TCHC complex-->,<ref name=\"PazzanoFinal\"/> arrived at the party and was confronted by Nahom Tsegazab, who displayed a handgun and challenged Owusu to fight if he did not leave. At approximately 10:40&nbsp;pm, less than two minutes after arriving at the party, Owusu opened fire and shot Nahom Tsegazab twice with a 9&nbsp;mm handgun.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> One of these bullets passed through Tsegazab and injured a bystander.<ref name=\"HashamPoster\"/>\n\nNahom Tsegazab was shot in the right biceps and abdomen. He fell to the ground in front of 207&nbsp;Danzig Street and reached for his gun, recklessly<!--this is from an agreed statement of fact at court--> firing eleven rounds at Owusu, who retreated through the crowd.<ref name=\"CherrySentenced\"/> One of these bullets struck Owusu in the leg.<ref name=\"HashamPoster\"/>\n\nA third shooter, who remains unidentified, fired fourteen rounds from an Uzi submachine-gun into the crowd.<ref name=\"MandelGuilty\"/>\n\nTwenty-four bystanders were shot, two fatally, and three people were trampled by the panicked crowd.<ref name=\"YuenComplex\"/> The shooting victims were aged 22&nbsp;months to 33&nbsp;years.<ref name=\"PostRetaliation\"/>\n\nShyanne Charles, 14, was fleeing from the initial gunfire when she ran into the line of fire of the third shooter. She was struck by several bullets and collapsed and died on the doorstep of 203&nbsp;Danzig Street.<ref name=\"CBCSentenced\"/>\n\nJoshua Yasay, 23, a community mentor with an honours degree in criminology who aspired to be a police officer,<ref name=\"DempseyFamily\"/> was shot by a bullet that pierced his heart and lungs.<ref name=\"MandelGuilty\"/> It has not been determined whether Tsegazab or the third shooter killed him.<ref name=\"CherrySentenced\"/>\n\nThe other shooting victims include:<!--All list entries must have a citation.

Two bullets were fired through the front window of the house where Mesquito lived with his mother<!--His mother's name is Nadine but she does not seem to have involvement in the incident and it doesn't seem necessary to state this-->. No one was injured.<ref name=\"RushSecond\"/>\n\nOn 19 July, while being treated at hospital, Nahom Tsegazab was charged with reckless discharge of a firearm in relation to the Danzig Street shooting.<ref name=\"MackraelCharged\"/> Mesquito was arrested on 27 July for two counts of uttering threats to cause serious bodily harm at the block party. At the time of his arrest, Mesquito was found carrying a loaded .22&nbsp;calibre revolver for which he was charged with nine weapons-related offenses. Later that summer Mesquito's family were evicted by TCHC for a lease violation, possibly stemming from these charges.<ref name=\"RushSecond\"/><ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/>\n\nIn the search for gunmen, police executed a series of vehicle inspections, checks on parolees, and search warrants in the week of 29 July&nbsp;&ndash; 4&nbsp;August, during the course of which over twenty firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition were seized.<ref name=\"DoucetteSeize\"/> There were concerns about violence during the 4&nbsp;August [[Caribana]] parade, which attracts one million people,<ref name=\"QMIAlleged\"/> and which had been the site of a fatal shooting in 2011.<ref name=\"HannayCaribbean\"/>\n\n===Social media===\n\nInitial reports from the shooting came via Twitter posts from witnesses and victims.<ref name=\"LearnKnow\"/> Within hours of the shooting, Twitter was flooded with posts referencing \"Ledda\" in connection with 14-year-old victim Shyanne Charles, warning that Ledda would seek out those responsible for the violence.<ref name=\"CTVRelative\"/> \"This is just the beginning. Touched the wrong people,\" read another message. Police also looked into whether a rap video posted two days before the shooting may have been related.<ref name=\"CTVWitnesses\"/><ref name=\"DoucetteLawrence\"/> As part of the investigation, police went through thousands of text messages and intercepted phone calls to rebuild the sequence of events. Among these messages were several in which Mesquito claimed responsibility for the shooting.<ref name=\"FreemanDropped\"/>\n\n==Investigation and later arrests==\n\nPolice were met with silence in many areas as they asked for witnesses to come forward,<ref name=\"LoriggioAppeal\"/> receiving few tips despite so many people having been witnesses to, or victims of, the events. The investigation gained momentum within a few weeks<ref name=\"ApplebyShot\"/> while the Summer Safety Initiative was launched to confront gangs and violence,<ref name=\"DoucetteTAVIS\"/> putting officers on foot patrol in high-crime areas. Officers built relationships with residents of these communities, where some had a historic distrust of police and fears of gang retaliation.<ref name=\"DempseyCrime\"/>\n\nA related shooting occurred on 2 September at a TCHC townhouse complex on Chester&nbsp;Le Boulevard. Naod Tsegazab had tracked down Owusu to retaliate for trying to kill his brother, Nahom. However, Naod only shot Owusu once in the leg before his gun jammed. As a result of the shooting, a search warrant was carried out on Owusu's Chester&nbsp;Le Boulevard home, leading to cocaine trafficking charges.<ref name=\"CherryCharges\"/> Naod was charged with the attempted murder of Owusu.<ref name=\"TorstarCharges\"/>\n\nThe first murder charge of the Danzig Street shooting investigation was made against Mesquito on 7&nbsp;November. He was charged with the attempted murder of Nahom Tsegazab, two counts of first-degree murder and 23 counts of aggravated assault.<ref name=\"CommissoMurder\"/> Later that month Nahom Tsegazab was charged with two counts of second-degree murder and 22 counts of aggravated assault.<ref name=\"OTooleBoy\"/><ref name=\"CBCCharged\"/> Owusu was arraigned with similar charges at the end of November.<ref name=\"TorstarCharges\"/> As the fourth person charged in connection with the Danzig Street shooting, Naod was charged on 4&nbsp;December with threatening death and weapons offenses but not murder.<ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/>\n\nOn 23 January 2015 the murder and assault charges against Mesquito were dropped after police uncovered evidence that he was in an apartment building {{convert|9|km}} away at the time of the shooting. Mesquito had continued to claim credit for the shooting throughout the 30&nbsp;months he was in custody. His lawyer suggested that since Mesquito had called for people to shoot up the party, he may have thought people close to him had done it and so took responsibility. In fact, no connection was found between Mesquito and Owusu, who had initiated the shooting. The defense lawyer praised police and the Crown Attorney, and stated that he had never before been involved in a case where law enforcement, the prosecution, and the defence had worked together to uncover the facts.<ref name=\"FreemanDropped\"/>\n\n==Convictions==\n\nNahom Tsegazab pleaded guilty on 11&nbsp;April 2014<ref name=\"CanadianGuilty\"/> to two counts of manslaughter and six counts of aggravated assault, and was sentenced to fourteen years in prison.<ref name=\"CBCSentenced\"/><ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> Tsegazab admitted that in participating in the gunfight he was a party to all the deaths and injuries that ensued.<ref name=\"MandelGuilty\"/>\n\nShaquan Mesquito pleaded guilty on 23&nbsp;January 2015 to counselling to commit murder, possession of a firearm, breach of a prohibition order, and uttering a threat. He was sentenced to nine years in prison (less time served).<ref name=\"CanadianDropped\"/> Although no connection was found to link Mesquito with Owusu, it was determined that Mesquito's threats to revisit the block party and \"shoot it up\" had put the Galloway Boys on a \"hair trigger\".<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/>\n\nNaod Tsegazab pleaded guilty in 2016 to the attempted murder of Owusu in the 2&nbsp;September Chester&nbsp;Le Boulevard shooting, carried out in the belief that Owusu had shot his brother. He was sentenced as an adult to seven years in prison.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/>\n\nFolorunso Owusu pleaded not guilty to two counts of second-degree murder, one count of attempted murder against Nahom Tsezagab, two counts of aggravated assault, and one charge of reckless discharging of a firearm.<ref name=\"PazzanoAlleged\"/> The defence maintained during the seven-week trial that Owusu was innocent and a victim of circumstance, shot while attending the party.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> The Crown provided a recording of Naod Tsegazab in the courthouse cells identifying Owusu, by nickname, as his brother's shooter. However, Naod testified that he invented the story to look tougher in jail, and Nahom Tsegazab testified that Owusu did not shoot him.<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> Found guilty, Owusu was sentenced as an adult to [[Life imprisonment in Canada|life in prison]] on 7&nbsp;December 2016.<ref name=\"JanusSentenced\"/> None of the bullets Owusu fired had killed anyone, but his actions had initiated the gunfire that killed two and injured twenty-two bystanders.<ref name=\"PazzanoAlleged\"/> In May 2017 Owusu was found guilty of criminal negligence charges,<ref name=\"PazzanoFinal\"/> which had been severed in a pre-trial motion,<ref name=\"HashamGuilty\"/> and sentenced to four years, to be served concurrently with the life sentence. With time served, he is eligible for [[Parole#Canada|parole]] in 2019.<ref name=\"PazzanoFinal\"/>\n\n==Effects==\n\n===Crime and policing===\nThe 16 July Danzig Street shooting was the worst [[mass shooting]] in Toronto,<ref name=\"CommissoMurder\"/><ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/> and occurred just six weeks after the [[Toronto Eaton Centre#2012 shooting|Eaton Centre shooting]].<ref name=\"PazzanoFinal\"/> The event made headlines around the world<ref name=\"NationalGalloway\"/> and prompted renewed debate on gun crime in urban areas. Two other deadly shooting incidents in the city followed within three days,<ref name=\"KitchingCharge\"/><ref name=\"MackraelCharged\"/> and three shootings occurred that Friday night.<ref name=\"CTVShootings\"/> That same evening a lone gunman [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|opened fire in a Colorado movie theatre]], killing twelve.<ref name=\"JohnsonGun\"/>\n\nAlthough data showed crime was decreasing nationally, a 25\u201326 July Forum Research poll for the ''[[National Post]]'' suggested that Canadians believed otherwise. The recent mass shootings and media coverage had a majority fearing \"a violent crime wave\". Pamela Rutledge, a media researcher studying the psychological impact of news coverage, stated that the apparent randomness of the crimes could lead to this perception. \"They really trigger a sense of fear in us because they aren't explainable [...] There's no way of making sense of it or figuring out why it didn't happen to me. So that anxiety accelerates your sense of danger.\"<ref name=\"EdmistonAnxiety\"/>\n\nThe [[Toronto Police Service]] established a strong uniform presence at Danzig Street, Kingston\u2013Galloway, and other areas that struggle with gang violence, in an attempt to stop acts of revenge.<ref name=\"CTVWitnesses\"/> This was extended with the Summer Safety Initiative, a seven-week program of mandatory overtime that effectively added more than 300 officers to patrols. The program emphasized \"old-school policing\", with officers walking street patrols in high-crime areas, building relationships with residents and the community. During these summer weeks, which typically see a spike in shootings and other crime, shooting deaths declined from a seven-year average of 6.4 to 2,<ref name=\"GillisCrime\"/> with dramatic drops in other violent crime categories. The initiative cost $2&nbsp;million, though Police Chief Bill Blair said it saved money by preventing crimes that are expensive to investigate.<ref name=\"DempseyCrime\"/>\n\nThe 2012 Summer Safety Initiative led to crime-prevention strategies and the development in 2013 of the Neighbourhood Officers program, which focuses on high-crime areas in each of Toronto's seventeen police divisions. In the program, officers are dedicated to a specific area for a period of at least two years, shifting away from enforcement-based policing to building relationships with residents, learning of specific issues affecting the communities, and improving intelligence about local crime.<ref name=\"GillisCrime\"/> The provincially-funded TAVIS (Toronto Anti-violence Intervention Strategy) program saw a similar shift in focus, having faced controversy for a practice of stopping, questioning, and documenting people&nbsp;&ndash; a procedure known as \"carding\"&nbsp;&ndash; which resulted in community distrust.<ref name=\"GillisCrime\"/>\n\nThe shooting brought an offer from Customs and Immigration officers to patrol with Toronto Police in hunts for gunmen. A liaison officer was established so police could quickly obtain immigration information on suspects. Nahom Tsegazab had arrived in Canada as a refugee from Somalia.<ref name=\"QMIAlleged\"/>\n\nViolent crime rates dropped in the year following the shooting,<ref name=\"DiMuccioYear\"/> and in 2013 there were no homicides in 43&nbsp;Division (southeast Scarborough, including Danzig Street), which recorded falling crime rates in every category.<ref name=\"PalamarchukDivision\"/> Deputy Chief of Police Peter Sloly credited the declining crime rates to several actors: the city, non-profit organizations, volunteers, youth outreach workers, community organizations, and a new victim and witness support program.<ref name=\"GillisCrime\"/> In 2015 community policing officers reported feeling more welcome and receiving more information from residents, intelligence that allowed police to implement a more \"surgical policing model\" that was less invasive on the community.<ref name=\"HerraltImproved\"/>\n\n[[Toronto Police Association]] President Mike McCormack said of the Danzig Street shooting: \"It changed the way we gather intelligence, do investigations and it really brought the whole issue of gang culture and some of the challenges that we have in policing to the forefront.\"<ref name=\"HerraltImproved\"/>\n\n===Gang crackdown===\n\nThe Danzig Street shooting generated new intelligence for police<ref name=\"DoucetteGalloway\"/> of an internal leadership struggle for control of the Galloway Boys and a territorial dispute with the neighbouring Orton Park Boys.<ref name=\"TorstarFight\"/> Police linked the Galloway Boys to eight shooting incidents between 4&nbsp;September 2011 and 10&nbsp;August 2012, including:<ref name=\"HaLeadership\"/>\n* Domino's shooting (4 September 2011)&nbsp;&ndash; three men were shot outside a Domino's Pizza parlour at Lawrence Avenue East and Susan Street.<ref name=\"CouttsGalloway\"/>\n* Northfield Drive shooting (4 November 2011)&nbsp;&ndash; a man was shot in the neck and chest during a drug deal on Northfield Drive off of Orton Park Road. Ramon Williams was charged with attempted murder.<ref name=\"DoucetteGalloway\"/>\n* Kingston Road drive-by (28 December 2011)&nbsp;&ndash; three young men were shot at 4315 Kingston Road in the territory of the Galloway Boys.<ref name=\"CouttsGalloway\"/>\n* Murder of D'Mitre Barnaby (30 December 2011)&nbsp;&ndash; D'Mitre Barnaby was gunned down in the parking lot of the Susan Towers apartment building at 3847 Lawrence Avenue East, mistaken for the drive-by shooter.<ref name=\"DoucetteGalloway\"/><ref name=\"CouttsGalloway\"/>\n* 3827 Lawrence East shooting (15 January 2012)&nbsp;&ndash; several shots were fired on the second floor of an apartment. Blood was found at the scene, but no victim has been identified.<ref name=\"CouttsGalloway\"/>\n* '''Danzig Street shooting''' (16 July 2012)\n* 4100 Lawrence East shooting (6 August 2012)&nbsp;&ndash; several shots were fired, with no known victims.<ref name=\"CouttsGalloway\"/>\n* Lawrence LRT shooting (10 August 2012)&nbsp;&ndash; one of the emerging leaders of the Galloway Boys was chased through the [[Lawrence East station|Lawrence LRT station]] and gunned down against a fence, surviving with critical injuries.<ref name=\"PoissonWar\"/><ref name=\"CrossInnocent\"/>\n\nD'Mitre Barnaby's murder sparked a police crackdown on the Scarborough gangs. Project Brazen was carried out from April to September 2012, resulting in nine arrests, the seizure of five firearms, and attempted murder charges for four shootings. Homicide detectives and officers from Scarborough divisions reviewed the evidence and launched Project Quell in June 2013, identifying seven members of the Orton Park Boys and twenty-five members of the Galloway Boys, charging them with a total of 363 offenses. Search warrants were executed on 3&nbsp;October in Toronto, [[London, Ontario|London]], and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], seizing more than {{convert|1|kg}} of cocaine and $10,000 in drug proceeds.<ref name=\"KitchingGangs\"/><ref name=\"HalimGang\"/>\n\nProject Quell officers confirmed that the Danzig Street investigation triggered investigations into the Galloway Boys and Orton Park.<ref name=\"HalimGang\"/>\n\n===Social programs===\n\nThe Danzig Street shooting brought renewed attention to the report ''Roots of Youth Violence'' commissioned by the Ontario Liberal government following a fatal Toronto high school shooting in 2007. The report warned of \"deeply troubling\" increases in the frequency and severity of youth violence, and addressed children's mental health issues, poverty, racism, education, family issues, the justice system, and a lack of voice for youth. In August 2012 the Liberal government incorporated some of the recommendations in a $20&nbsp;million action plan to curb youth violence.<ref name=\"DiMuccioYear\"/>\n\nNigerian-born businessman Akanimo Udofiya donated $150,000 over three years to help fund Our&nbsp;Space, a community drop-in centre established in a formerly vacant townhouse at 230 Danzig Street. The centre provided after-school programs, a homework club, hot meals for area youth, employment resources, and a base for the Danzig Residents Committee and community outreach programs.<ref name=\"HerraltImproved\"/><ref name=\"AdlerDonation\"/><ref name=\"WilsonAnniversary\"/> Toronto Community Housing donated space for the community hub, evicted one resident in connection with the shooting, and installed new lighting and twenty security cameras in May 2013.<ref name=\"ArmstrongAnniversary\"/>\n\nA number of memorial scholarships were created. [[York University]] set up the Joshua Yasay Award for excellence in criminology and community service.<ref name=\"DempseyFamily\"/> Two trusts were set up in Shyanne Charles' name, for scholarships starting at the elementary school level.<ref name=\"PoissonGrandfather\"/>\n\n===Rob Ford===\n{{See also|Timeline of Rob Ford video scandal}}\n\nMayor [[Rob Ford]] called for the Danzig Street shooters to be expelled from the city, saying: \"I want these people out of the city. And I'm not going to stop. Not put 'em in jail, then come back and you can live in the city. No. I want 'em out of the city. Go somewhere else. I don't want 'em living in the city anymore.\"<ref name=\"FordQuotes\"/> The day after the shooting, he added, \"We must use every legal means to make life for these thugs miserable, to put them behind bars, or to run them out of town. We will not rest until being a gang member is a miserable, undesirable life.\"<ref name=\"KuitenbrouwerTracks\"/> Ford called for longer prison sentences and decried \"hug a thug\" social programs, voting against accepting federal grants worth more than $16&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"GrantGuns\"/>\n\nIn 2013 Ford was the subject of a video scandal<ref name=\"StarCrack\"/><ref name=\"DenetteConnecting\"/> and admitted to smoking crack cocaine and associating with drug dealers.<ref name=\"BruserCrack\"/> While [[2014 Toronto mayoral election|campaigning for re-election]] in 2014, Ford visited Danzig Street on the second anniversary of the mass shooting, dodging questions about his own connection to drug dealers. Councillor Paula Fletcher criticized his attending the event: \"You can't have it both ways&nbsp;\u2013 you can't be part of it and then crusading to stop it ... You can't technically be condoning guns and gangs and then going out saying how terrible it is that people have been shot and killed.\"<ref name=\"JeffordsFord\"/>\n\n===In media===\n\nToronto Police Sergeant Rod Chung collaborated with local hip hop artist [[Promise (rapper)|Promise]] to reach out to urban youth. With help from artists Kaid and Liya, they released a track titled \"Make a Change\", inspired by the Danzig Street shooting. Promise wrote the lyrics, which call for taking ownership of the city and an end to violence. The track premiered on 30&nbsp;September 2012 on [[CKFG-FM]], a black owned and operated commercial radio station, which hosted an on-air town hall meeting to continue discussions between the community, artists, and the police.<ref name=\"DaubsPromise\"/>\n\nThe day after the Danzig Street shooting, Toronto-born rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] tweeted his condolences to the families of Yasay and Charles.<ref name=\"DaubsDrake\"/> He rapped about this \"one summer day that went horribly wrong\" as a featured artist on Snoop Dogg's reggae track \"[[No Guns Allowed]]\":<ref name=\"CanadianDrake\"/><ref name=\"NoGunsArtists\"/>\n\n{{poemquote\n|text=\nTold you no guns and you didn't listen\nLife is so heavy with that on your soul\nDedicate this to Shyanne and Josh\nAnd pour something out for the lives that they stole\n}}\n\nThe track premiered live on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' on 11&nbsp;March 2013<ref name=\"PayneSnoop\"/> and was released on 2&nbsp;April 2013 as the third single from Snoop's album ''[[Reincarnated (album)|Reincarnated]]''.<ref name=\"IconSnoop\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Law|Canada}}\n*[[Crime in Toronto]]\n*[[Crime in

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has
