The [[Little Sur River]]  and its tributaries almost surround the mountain. The North Fork wraps around the northern flank and eastern edge of the mountain, and the South Fork crosses the mountain to the west and south-west. The mountain is known for an extremely high-grade limestone deposit. The peak and surrounding {{convert|2800|acre}}, are owned by the  The [[Graniterock|Granite Rock Company]] of [[Watsonville, California]]. The lower western slopes of the mountain are the property of the [[El Sur Ranch]]. The [[Old Coast Road]] built in the early 1900s cuts across its western flank. The view from its summit allows hikers to see [[Ventana Double Cone]] and Kandlbinder Peak to the southeast, as well as a host of other Big Sur peaks: Mt. Manuel, Post Summit, Uncle Sam Mtn., and [[Cone Peak]] far to the south.\n\nThe peak was considered a sacred mountain by the [[Esselen]] people from which all life originated. According to legend, the world was destroyed in a great flood, and when the waters rose, the summit of Pico Blanco was the only land to remain exposed. According to one version of the legend, an eagle, coyote, and hummingbird, or\u2014based on another, an eagle, crow, raven, hawk, and hummingbird\u2014survived the flood. A magical feather was plucked from the eagle and planted in the ocean to cause the waters to recede, recreating the world.<ref name=\"summit post\">{{cite web |title=Pico Blanco : Climbing, Hiking & Mountaineering : SummitPost |url=https://www.summitpost.org/pico-blanco/154509 |website=www.summitpost.org |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe mountain was seen by [[J. Smeaton Chase]], who traveled on horseback up the coast in 1911, and reported:\n\n{{quote|Near by, and on my left, stood the lonely rock of Point Sur, its summit hidden in mists; and on the other side rose a striking white mountain called Pico Blanco, the second highest point of the range.

The [[Little Sur River]]  and its tributaries almost surround the mountain. The North Fork wraps around the northern flank and eastern edge of the mountain, and the South Fork crosses the mountain to the west and south-west. The mountain is known for an extremely high-grade limestone deposit. The peak and surrounding {{convert|2800|acre}}, are owned by the  The [[Graniterock|Granite Rock Company]] of [[Watsonville, California]]. The lower western slopes of the mountain are the property of the [[El Sur Ranch]]. The [[Old Coast Road]] built in the early 1900s cuts across its western flank. The view from its summit allows hikers to see [[Ventana Double Cone]] and Kandlbinder Peak to the the southeast, as well as a host of other Big Sur peaks: Mt. Manuel, Post Summit, Uncle Sam Mtn., and [[Cone Peak]] far to the south.\n\nThe peak was considered a sacred mountain by the [[Esselen]] people from which all life originated. According to legend, the world was destroyed in a great flood, and when the waters rose, the summit of Pico Blanco was the only land to remain exposed. According to one version of the legend, an eagle, coyote, and hummingbird, or\u2014based on another, an eagle, crow, raven, hawk, and hummingbird\u2014survived the flood. A magical feather was plucked from the eagle and planted in the ocean to cause the waters to recede, recreating the world.<ref name=\"summit post\">{{cite web |title=Pico Blanco : Climbing, Hiking & Mountaineering : SummitPost |url=https://www.summitpost.org/pico-blanco/154509 |website=www.summitpost.org |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe mountain was seen by [[J.

Many ornaments are performed as \"fast notes\" around a central, main [[Musical note|note]].\n\nThere are many types of ornaments, ranging from the addition of a single, short [[grace note]] before a main note to the performance of a virtuostic and flamboyant trill. The amount of '''ornamentation''' in a piece of music can vary from quite extensive (it was often extensive in the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], from 1600 to 1750) to relatively little or even none. The word ''agr\u00e9ment'' is used specifically to indicate the French Baroque style of ornamentation.\n\n== Improvised vs. written ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2019}}\nIn the Baroque period, it was common for performers to [[musical improvisation|improvise]] ornamentation on a given melodic line. A singer performing a [[da capo aria]], for instance, would sing the melody relatively unornamented the first time and decorate it with additional flourishes and [[Trill (music)|trills]] the second time. Similarly, a [[harpsichord]] player performing a simple melodic line was expected to be able to improvise harmonically and stylistically appropriate trills, [[mordent]]s (upper or lower) and [[appoggiatura]]s.\n\nOrnamentation may also be indicated by the composer. A number of standard ornaments (described below) are indicated with standard symbols in [[music notation]], while other ornamentations may be appended to the score in small notes, or simply written out normally as fully sized notes. Frequently, a composer will have his or her own vocabulary of ornaments, which will be explained in a preface, much like a code. A [[grace note]] is a note written in smaller type, with or without a slash through it, to indicate that its [[note value]] does not count as part of the total time value of the [[Bar (music)|bar]]. Alternatively, the term may refer more generally to any of the small notes used to mark some other ornament (see {{section link|#Appoggiatura}} below), or in association with some other ornament's indication (see {{section link|#Trill}} below), regardless of the timing used in the execution.\n\nIn [[Spain]], melodies ornamented upon repetition (\"[[Division (music)|divisions]]\") were called \"[[Variation (music)#History of variations|diferencias]]\", and can be traced back to 1538, when [[Luis de Narv\u00e1ez]] published the first collection of such music for the [[vihuela]].<ref>Elaine Sisman, \"Variations, \u00a74: Origins\", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n\n===Trill===\n{{Main|Trill (music)}}\n\nA [[trill (music)|trill]], also known as a \"shake\", is a rapid alternation between an indicated note and the one above it. In simple music, trills may be [[Diatonic and chromatic|diatonic]], using just the notes of the scale; in other cases, the trill may be [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]]. The trill is usually indicated by either a {{serif|'''''tr'''''}} or a {{serif|'''''tr~~'''''}}, with the '''~''' representing the length of the trill, above the [[Staff (music)|staff]].\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        g2\\trill\n    }\n}\n\n</score>\n\nAt a moderate tempo, the above might be executed as follows:\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        g32[ a g \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 a \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 g a g a]\n        g32[ a g \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 a \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 g a g a]\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\nIn Baroque music, the trill is sometimes indicated with a '''+''' (plus) sign above or below the note.\n\nIn the late 18th century, when performers play a trill, it always start from the upper note. However, \"[Heinrich Christoph] Koch expressed no preference and observed that it was scarcely a matter of much importance whether the trill began one way or the other, since there was no audible difference after the initial note had been sounded.\"{{sfn|Brown|2004|page=492}} Clive Brown writes that \"Despite three different ways of showing the trills, it seems likely that a trill beginning with the upper note and ending with a turn was envisaged in each case.\"{{sfn|Brown|2004|page=499}}\n\nSometimes it is expected that the trill will end with a turn (by sounding the note below rather than the note above the principal note, immediately before the last sounding of the principal note), or some other variation. Such variations are often marked with a few grace notes following the note that bears the trill indication.\n\nThere is also a single tone trill variously called ''trillo'' or ''[[tremolo]]'' in late Renaissance and early Baroque. Trilling on a single note is particularly idiomatic for the bowed strings.\n\n===Mordent===<!-- This section is linked from [[Ornament (music)]] -->\n{{main|Mordent}}\nA [[mordent]] is a rapid alternation between an indicated note, the note with no line through the middle (called the ''upper mordent'', ''inverted mordent'', or ''pralltriller'') or the note with a line through the middle (called the ''lower mordent'' or ''mordent''), and the indicated note again. The upper mordent is indicated by a short thick [[tilde]] (which may also indicate a trill); the lower mordent is the same with a short vertical line through it.\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\"> { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\relative c'' { \\time 2/4 d\\prall c\\mordent } }</score>\n\nAs with the trill, the exact speed with which a mordent is performed will vary according to the tempo of the piece, but, at a moderate tempo, the above might be executed as follows:\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\relative c'' { \\time 2/4 d32 e d16~ d8  c32 b c16~ c8 } } </score>\n\nConfusion over the meaning of the unadorned word ''mordent'' has led to the modern terms ''upper'' and ''lower'' mordent being used, rather than ''mordent'' and ''inverted mordent''. Practice, notation, and nomenclature vary widely for all of these ornaments; that is to say, whether, by including the [[symbol]] for a mordent in a [[Sheet music|musical score]], a composer intended the direction of the additional note (or notes) to be played above or below the principal note written on the sheet music varies according to when the piece was written, and in which country.{{Listen|type=music|filename=Lmordent no-lmordent.ogg|title=Mordents|description=The first bar of the ''[[Goldberg Variation]]'' No. 7, first played with lower mordents, then without.}}\n\nIn the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], a mordant (the [[German language|German]] or [[Scots language|Scottish]] equivalent of ''[[mordent]]'') was what later came to be called an ''[[inverted mordent]]'' and what is now often called a ''[[lower mordent]]''. In the 19th century, however, the name ''mordent'' was generally applied to what is now called the ''upper'' mordent. Although mordents are now thought of as a single alternation between notes, in the Baroque period a ''mordant'' may have sometimes been executed with more than one alternation between the indicated note and the note below, making it a sort of inverted trill. Mordents of all sorts might typically, in some periods, begin with an extra ''inessential note'' (the lesser, added note), rather than with the ''principal note'' as shown in the examples here. The same applies to trills, which in the Baroque and [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] periods would begin with the added, upper note. A ''lower'' inessential note may or may not be chromatically raised (that is, with a natural, a sharp, or even a double sharp) to make it one [[semitone]] lower than the principal note.\n\n\n=== Turn ===<!--this section is linked to directly from [[Turn (music)]] & [[Gruppetto]]-->\n{{Redirect|Gruppetto|the group of cyclists behind the peloton|Grupetto}}\nA turn is a short [[Figure (music)|figure]] consisting of the note above the one indicated, the note itself, the note below the one indicated, and the note itself again. It is marked by a backwards S-shape lying on its side above the staff. The details of its execution depend partly on the exact placement of the turn mark. For instance, the turns below\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n<< \\clef treble\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\stemNeutral c4. d8 e2  c4 d\\turn e2\n    } \\\\ {\n        s4 s^\\turn\n    }\n>>\n}\n</score>\n\nmay be executed as\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        c8 \\tuplet 3/2 { d16 c b } c8 d e2\n        c4 e16 d c d e2\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\nThe exact speed with which a turn is executed can vary, as can its rhythm. The question of how a turn is best executed is largely one of context, convention, and taste. The lower and upper added notes may or may not be chromatically raised.\n\nAn inverted turn (the note below the one indicated, the note itself, the note above it, and the note itself again) is usually indicated by putting a short vertical line through the normal turn sign, though sometimes the sign itself is turned upside down.\n\n=== Appoggiatura ===\n{{main|Appoggiatura}}\n\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Apog no-apog.ogg|title=Appoggiatura|description=A passage with two phrases ending in appoggiaturas, followed by these phrases without them (160 KB)}}\n\nAn [[appoggiatura]] ({{IPAc-en|\u0259|\u02cc|p|\u0252|d\u0292|\u0259|\u02c8|tj|\u028a\u0259r|\u0259}}; {{IPA-it|appodd\u0292a\u02c8tu\u02d0ra|lang}}) is an added note that is important melodically (unlike an acciaccatura) and suspends the principal note by a portion of its time-value, often about half, but this may be considerably more or less depending on the context. The added note (the '''auxiliary note''') is one degree higher or lower than the principal note, and may or may not be chromatically altered. Appoggiaturas are also usually on the strong or strongest beat of the resolution, are themselves emphasised, and are approached by a leap and left by a step in the opposite direction of the leap.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ars-nova.com/Theory%20Q%26A/Q93.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029204901/http://www.ars-nova.com/Theory%20Q%26A/Q93.html |archive-date=2016-10-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[[Kent Kennan]], ''Counterpoint'', Fourth Edition, p. 40</ref>\n\nAn appoggiatura is often written as a [[grace note]] prefixed to a principal note and printed in small character,<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Appoggiatura |volume=2 |page=225}}</ref> without the oblique stroke:\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        \\grace { d4( } c2)\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\nThis may be executed as follows:\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        d4( c)\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\n=== Acciaccatura  ===\nThe word ''acciaccatura'' ({{IPAc-en|uk|\u0259|\u02cc|t\u0283|\u00e6|k|\u0259|\u02c8|tj|\u028a\u0259r|\u0259}}, {{IPAc-en|us|-|t\u0283|\u0251\u02d0|k|\u0259|-}}; {{IPA-it|att\u0283akka\u02c8tu\u02d0ra|lang}}) comes from the Italian verb ''[[Wikt:acciaccare|acciaccare]]'', \"to crush\". In the 18th century, it was an ornament applied to any of the main notes of [[Arpeggio|arpeggiated]] chords, either a tone or semitone below the chord tone, struck simultaneously with it and then immediately released. Hence the German translation ''Zusammenschlag'' (together-stroke).<ref>Robert E. Seletsky, \"Acciaccatura (It.; Fr. ''pinc\u00e9 \u00e9touff\u00e9''; Ger. ''Zusammenschlag'')\", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, the acciaccatura (sometimes called ''short appoggiatura'') came to be a shorter variant of the ''long appoggiatura'', where the delay of the principal note is quick. It is written using a grace note (often a quaver, or [[eighth note]]), with an oblique stroke through the stem. In the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], an acciaccatura is usually performed before the beat and the emphasis is on the main note, not the grace note. The ''appoggiatura'' long or short has the emphasis on the grace note.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        \\slashedGrace { d8( } c4)\n        \\slashedGrace { e8( } d4)\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\nThe exact interpretation of this will vary according to the tempo of the piece, but the following is possible:\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        d32 c32~ c16~ c8  e32 d32~ d16~ d8\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\nWhether the note should be played before or on the beat is largely a question of taste and performance practice. Exceptionally, the acciaccatura may be notated in the bar preceding the note to which it is attached, showing that it is to be played before the beat.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The implication also varies with the composer and the period. For example, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s long appoggiaturas are \u2013 to the eye \u2013 indistinguishable from [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s before-the-beat acciaccaturas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Glissando===\n{{Main|Glissando}}\n\nA [[glissando]] is a slide from one note to another, signified by a wavy line connecting the two notes.\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c' {\n        \\override Glissando.style = #'trill\n        e2\\glissando e'\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\nAll of the intervening diatonic or chromatic (depending on instrument and context) are heard, albeit very briefly. In this way, the glissando differs from [[portamento]]. In [[contemporary classical music]] (especially in avant garde pieces), a glissando tends to assume the whole value of the initial note.\n\n===Slide===\n{{Main|Slide (musical ornament)}}\n[[File:Schleifer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Schleifer notation]]\nA [[Slide (musical ornament)|slide]] (or ''Schleifer'' in German) instructs the performer to begin one or two diatonic steps below the marked note and slide upward. The schleifer usually includes a prall trill or mordent trill at the end. Willard A. Palmer writes that \"[t]he schleifer is a 'sliding' ornament, usually used to fill in the gap between a note and the previous one.\"<ref>''First Lesson in Bach for the Piano'', Edited by Walter Carroll & Willard A.

This ornament has also been referred to as a ''cadent'' or a ''springer'' in English Baroque performance practice. Instruction books from the Baroque period, such as [[Christopher Simpson]]'s ''The Division Violist'', refer to the ''cadent'' as an ornament in which \"a Note is sometimes graced by joyning {{Sic|}} part of its sound to the note following... whose following Quaver is Placed with the ensuing Note, but played with the same Bow.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dannreuther |first1=Edward |title=Musical ornamentation |date=1893 |publisher=Edwin F.

[[Michael Praetorius]] spoke warmly of musicians' \"sundry good and merry pranks with little runs/leaps\".{{Citequote|date=May 2012}}\n\nUntil the last decade of the 16th century the emphasis is on ''divisions'', also known as ''diminutions'', ''passaggi'' (in Italian), ''gorgia'' (\"throat\", first used as a term for vocal ornamentation by [[Nicola Vicentino]] in 1555), or ''glosas'' (by Ortiz, in both Spanish and Italian) \u2013 a way to decorate a simple cadence or interval with extra shorter notes. These start as simple passing notes, progress to step-wise additions and in the most complicated cases are rapid passages of equal valued notes \u2013 virtuosic flourishes. There are rules for designing them, to make sure that the original structure of the music is left intact. Towards the end of this period the divisions detailed in the treatises contain more dotted and other uneven rhythms and leaps of more than one step at a time.\n\nStarting with Archilei (1589),{{Full citation needed|date=May 2012}}<!--nothing by Archilei is found in the following list.--> the treatises bring in a new set of expressive devices called ''graces'' alongside the divisions.

Most ornaments occur on the beat, and use diatonic intervals more exclusively than ornaments in later periods do. While any table of ornaments must give a strict presentation, consideration has to be given to the tempo and note length, since at rapid tempos it would be difficult or impossible to play all of the notes that are usually required. One realisation of some common Baroque ornaments is set in the following table from the ''[[Klavierb\u00fcchlein f\u00fcr Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]:\n[[File:Tableofornaments750.jpg|alt=|center|thumb|750x750px|[[File:Tableofornaments750.mid|thumb|center]]]]<!--this image shown wider than 400px for clarity-->\n\n=== Classical period ===\nIn the late 18th and early 19th century, there were no standard ways of performing ornaments and sometimes several distinct ornaments might be performed in a same way.{{sfn|Brown|2004|page=456}}\n\nIn the 19th century, performers were adding or improvising ornaments on compositions.

Even in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s compositions, there is no ornament that come from outside of the score are allowed, as Brown explains: \"Most of the [[chamber music]] from Mozart onwards that still remains in the repertoire belongs to the kind in which every note is thought out' and which tolerates virtually no ornamental additions of the type under consideration here...\"{{sfn|Brown|2004|pages=415\u2013425}} Recent scholarship has however brought this statement in question.<ref>{{citation|last1=Levin |first1=Robert|author-link=Robert D.

While these ornaments have universal names, their realizations and effects vary depending on the instrument. Jazz music incorporates most of the standard \"classical\" ornaments, such as trills, grace notes, mordents, glissandi and turns but adds a variety of additional ornaments such as \"dead\" or [[ghost note]]s (a percussive sound, notated by an \"X\"), \"doit\" notes and \"fall\" notes (annotated by curved lines above the note, indicating by direction of curve that the note should either rapidly rise or fall on the scale),<ref name=\"Read1969\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/musicnotationman0000read|url-access=registration|title=Music notation: a manual of modern practice|last=Read|first=Gardner|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|year=1969|accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref> squeezes (notated by a curved line from an \"X\" to a specific pitch, that denotes an un-pitched glissando), and shakes (notated by a squiggly line over a note, which indicates a fast lip trill for brass players and a minor third trill for winds).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timusic.net/wp-content/uploads/jazz+artikulation.pdf|title=Interpretation of Jazz Band Literature|last=Brye|first=John|website=The U.S. Army Field Band}}</ref>\n\n=== Indian classical music ===\nIn [[Carnatic music]], the [[Sanskrit]] term ''gamaka'' (which means \"to move\") is used to denote ornamentation. One of the most unusual forms of ornamentation in world music is the Carnatic ''kampitam'' which is about oscillating a note in diverse ways by varying amplitude, speed or number of times the note is oscillated. This is a highly subtle, yet scientific ornamentation as the same note can be oscillated in different ways based on the raga or context within a raga. For instance, the fourth note (Ma) in Shankarabharanam or Begada allows at least three to five types of oscillation based on the phrasings within the raga.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.acharyanet.com/lesson/22-sarasvati-begada-geetam/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719034951/http://www.acharyanet.com/lesson/22-sarasvati-begada-geetam/ |archive-date=2015-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAnother important gamaka in Carnatic is the \"Sphuritam\" which is about rendering a note twice but forcefully from a grace note immediately below it the second time.

The amount of '''ornamentation''' in a piece of music can vary from quite extensive (it was often extensive in the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], from 1600 to 1750) to relatively little or even none. The word ''agr\u00e9ment'' is used specifically to indicate the French Baroque style of ornamentation.\n\n== Improvised vs. written ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2019}}\nIn the Baroque period, it was common for performers to [[musical improvisation|improvise]] ornamentation on a given melodic line. A singer performing a [[da capo aria]], for instance, would sing the melody relatively unornamented the first time and decorate it with additional flourishes and [[Trill (music)|trills]] the second time. Similarly, a [[harpsichord]] player performing a simple melodic line was expected to be able to improvise harmonically and stylistically appropriate trills, [[mordent]]s (upper or lower) and [[appoggiatura]]s.\n\nOrnamentation may also be indicated by the composer. A number of standard ornaments (described below) are indicated with standard symbols in [[music notation]], while other ornamentations may be appended to the score in small notes, or simply written out normally as fully sized notes. Frequently, a composer will have his or her own vocabulary of ornaments, which will be explained in a preface, much like a code. A [[grace note]] is a note written in smaller type, with or without a slash through it, to indicate that its [[note value]] does not count as part of the total time value of the [[Bar (music)|bar]]. Alternatively, the term may refer more generally to any of the small notes used to mark some other ornament (see {{section link|#Appoggiatura}} below), or in association with some other ornament's indication (see {{section link|#Trill}} below), regardless of the timing used in the execution.\n\nIn [[Spain]], melodies ornamented upon repetition (\"[[Division (music)|divisions]]\") were called \"[[Variation (music)#History of variations|diferencias]]\", and can be traced back to 1538, when [[Luis de Narv\u00e1ez]] published the first collection of such music for the [[vihuela]].<ref>Elaine Sisman, \"Variations, \u00a74: Origins\", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n\n===Trill===\n{{Main|Trill (music)}}\n\nA [[trill (music)|trill]], also known as a \"shake\", is a rapid alternation between an indicated note and the one above it. In simple music, trills may be [[Diatonic and chromatic|diatonic]], using just the notes of the scale; in other cases, the trill may be [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]]. The trill is usually indicated by either a {{serif|'''''tr'''''}} or a {{serif|'''''tr~~'''''}}, with the '''~''' representing the length of the trill, above the [[Staff (music)|staff]].\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        g2\\trill\n    }\n}\n\n</score>\n\nAt a moderate tempo, the above might be executed as follows:\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        g32[ a g \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 a \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 g a g a]\n        g32[ a g \\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 a \\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 g a g a]\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\nIn Baroque music, the trill is sometimes indicated with a '''+''' (plus) sign above or below the note.\n\nIn the late 18th century, when performers play a trill, it always start from the upper note. However, \"[Heinrich Christoph] Koch expressed no preference and observed that it was scarcely a matter of much importance whether the trill began one way or the other, since there was no audible difference after the initial note had been sounded.\"{{sfn|Brown|2004|page=492}} Clive Brown writes that \"Despite three different ways of showing the trills, it seems likely that a trill beginning with the upper note and ending with a turn was envisaged in each case.\"{{sfn|Brown|2004|page=499}}\n\nSometimes it is expected that the trill will end with a turn (by sounding the note below rather than the note above the principal note, immediately before the last sounding of the principal note), or some other variation. Such variations are often marked with a few grace notes following the note that bears the trill indication.\n\nThere is also a single tone trill variously called ''trillo'' or ''[[tremolo]]'' in late Renaissance and early Baroque. Trilling on a single note is particularly idiomatic for the bowed strings.\n\n===Mordent===<!-- This section is linked from [[Ornament (music)]] -->\n{{main|Mordent}}\nA [[mordent]] is a rapid alternation between an indicated note, the note above (called the ''upper mordent'', ''inverted mordent'', or ''pralltriller'') or below (called the ''lower mordent'' or ''mordent''), and the indicated note again. The upper mordent is indicated by a short thick [[tilde]] (which may also indicate a trill); the lower mordent is the same with a short vertical line through it.\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\"> { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\relative c'' { \\time 2/4 d\\prall c\\mordent } }</score>\n\nAs with the trill, the exact speed with which a mordent is performed will vary according to the tempo of the piece, but, at a moderate tempo, the above might be executed as follows:\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\relative c'' { \\time 2/4 d32 e d16~ d8  c32 b c16~ c8 } } </score>\n\nConfusion over the meaning of the unadorned word ''mordent'' has led to the modern terms ''upper'' and ''lower'' mordent being used, rather than ''mordent'' and ''inverted mordent''. Practice, notation, and nomenclature vary widely for all of these ornaments; that is to say, whether, by including the [[symbol]] for a mordent in a [[Sheet music|musical score]], a composer intended the direction of the additional note (or notes) to be played above or below the principal note written on the sheet music varies according to when the piece was written, and in which country.{{Listen|type=music|filename=Lmordent no-lmordent.ogg|title=Mordents|description=The first bar of the ''[[Goldberg Variation]]'' No. 7, first played with lower mordents, then without.}}\n\nIn the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], a mordant (the [[German language|German]] or [[Scots language|Scottish]] equivalent of ''[[mordent]]'') was what later came to be called an ''[[inverted mordent]]'' and what is now often called a ''[[lower mordent]]''. In the 19th century, however, the name ''mordent'' was generally applied to what is now called the ''upper'' mordent. Although mordents are now thought of as a single alternation between notes, in the Baroque period a ''mordant'' may have sometimes been executed with more than one alternation between the indicated note and the note below, making it a sort of inverted trill. Mordents of all sorts might typically, in some periods, begin with an extra ''inessential note'' (the lesser, added note), rather than with the ''principal note'' as shown in the examples here. The same applies to trills, which in the Baroque and [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] periods would begin with the added, upper note. A ''lower'' inessential note may or may not be chromatically raised (that is, with a natural, a sharp, or even a double sharp) to make it one [[semitone]] lower than the principal note.\n\n=== Turn ===<!--this section is linked to directly from [[Turn (music)]] & [[Gruppetto]]-->\n{{Redirect|Gruppetto|the group of cyclists behind the peloton|Grupetto}}\nA turn is a short [[Figure (music)|figure]] consisting of the note above the one indicated, the note itself, the note below the one indicated, and the note itself again. It is marked by a backwards S-shape lying on its side above the staff. The details of its execution depend partly on the exact placement of the turn mark. For instance, the turns below\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n<< \\clef treble\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\stemNeutral c4. d8 e2  c4 d\\turn e2\n    } \\\\ {\n        s4 s^\\turn\n    }\n>>\n}\n</score>\n\nmay be executed as\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        c8 \\tuplet 3/2 { d16 c b } c8 d e2\n        c4 e16 d c d e2\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\nThe exact speed with which a turn is executed can vary, as can its rhythm. The question of how a turn is best executed is largely one of context, convention, and taste. The lower and upper added notes may or may not be chromatically raised.\n\nAn inverted turn (the note below the one indicated, the note itself, the note above it, and the note itself again) is usually indicated by putting a short vertical line through the normal turn sign, though sometimes the sign itself is turned upside down.\n\n=== Appoggiatura ===\n{{main|Appoggiatura}}\n\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Apog no-apog.ogg|title=Appoggiatura|description=A passage with two phrases ending in appoggiaturas, followed by these phrases without them (160 KB)}}\n\nAn [[appoggiatura]] ({{IPAc-en|\u0259|\u02cc|p|\u0252|d\u0292|\u0259|\u02c8|tj|\u028a\u0259r|\u0259}}; {{IPA-it|appodd\u0292a\u02c8tu\u02d0ra|lang}}) is an added note that is important melodically (unlike an acciaccatura) and suspends the principal note by a portion of its time-value, often about half, but this may be considerably more or less depending on the context. The added note (the '''auxiliary note''') is one degree higher or lower than the principal note, and may or may not be chromatically altered. Appoggiaturas are also usually on the strong or strongest beat of the resolution, are themselves emphasised, and are approached by a leap and left by a step in the opposite direction of the leap.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ars-nova.com/Theory%20Q%26A/Q93.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029204901/http://www.ars-nova.com/Theory%20Q%26A/Q93.html |archive-date=2016-10-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[[Kent Kennan]], ''Counterpoint'', Fourth Edition, p. 40</ref>\n\nAn appoggiatura is often written as a [[grace note]] prefixed to a principal note and printed in small character,<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Appoggiatura |volume=2 |page=225}}</ref> without the oblique stroke:\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        \\grace { d4( } c2)\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\nThis may be executed as follows:\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        d4( c)\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\n=== Acciaccatura  ===\nThe word ''acciaccatura'' ({{IPAc-en|uk|\u0259|\u02cc|t\u0283|\u00e6|k|\u0259|\u02c8|tj|\u028a\u0259r|\u0259}}, {{IPAc-en|us|-|t\u0283|\u0251\u02d0|k|\u0259|-}}; {{IPA-it|att\u0283akka\u02c8tu\u02d0ra|lang}}) comes from the Italian verb ''[[Wikt:acciaccare|acciaccare]]'', \"to crush\". In the 18th century, it was an ornament applied to any of the main notes of [[Arpeggio|arpeggiated]] chords, either a tone or semitone below the chord tone, struck simultaneously with it and then immediately released. Hence the German translation ''Zusammenschlag'' (together-stroke).<ref>Robert E. Seletsky, \"Acciaccatura (It.; Fr. ''pinc\u00e9 \u00e9touff\u00e9''; Ger. ''Zusammenschlag'')\", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, the acciaccatura (sometimes called ''short appoggiatura'') came to be a shorter variant of the ''long appoggiatura'', where the delay of the principal note is quick. It is written using a grace note (often a quaver, or [[eighth note]]), with an oblique stroke through the stem. In the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], an acciaccatura is usually performed before the beat and the emphasis is on the main note, not the grace note. The ''appoggiatura'' long or short has the emphasis on the grace note.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        \\slashedGrace { d8( } c4)\n        \\slashedGrace { e8( } d4)\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\nThe exact interpretation of this will vary according to the tempo of the piece, but the following is possible:\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 2/4\n        d32 c32~ c16~ c8  e32 d32~ d16~ d8\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\nWhether the note should be played before or on the beat is largely a question of taste and performance practice. Exceptionally, the acciaccatura may be notated in the bar preceding the note to which it is attached, showing that it is to be played before the beat.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The implication also varies with the composer and the period. For example, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s long appoggiaturas are \u2013 to the eye \u2013 indistinguishable from [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s before-the-beat acciaccaturas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Glissando===\n{{Main|Glissando}}\n\nA [[glissando]] is a slide from one note to another, signified by a wavy line connecting the two notes.\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n    \\relative c' {\n        \\override Glissando.style = #'trill\n        e2\\glissando e'\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\nAll of the intervening diatonic or chromatic (depending on instrument and context) are heard, albeit very briefly. In this way, the glissando differs from [[portamento]]. In [[contemporary classical music]] (especially in avant garde pieces), a glissando tends to assume the whole value of the initial note.\n\n===Slide===\n{{Main|Slide (musical ornament)}}\n[[File:Schleifer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Schleifer notation]]\nA [[Slide (musical ornament)|slide]] (or ''Schleifer'' in German) instructs the performer to begin one or two diatonic steps below the marked note and slide upward. The schleifer usually includes a prall trill or mordent trill at the end. Willard A. Palmer writes that \"[t]he schleifer is a 'sliding' ornament, usually used to fill in the gap between a note and the previous one.\"<ref>''First Lesson in Bach for the Piano'', Edited by Walter Carroll & Willard A.

This ornament has also been referred to as a ''cadent'' or a ''springer'' in English Baroque performance practice. Instruction books from the Baroque period, such as [[Christopher Simpson]]'s ''The Division Violist'', refer to the ''cadent'' as an ornament in which \"a Note is sometimes graced by joyning {{Sic|}} part of its sound to the note following... whose following Quaver is Placed with the ensuing Note, but played with the same Bow.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dannreuther |first1=Edward |title=Musical ornamentation |date=1893 |publisher=Edwin F.

[[Michael Praetorius]] spoke warmly of musicians' \"sundry good and merry pranks with little runs/leaps\".{{Citequote|date=May 2012}}\n\nUntil the last decade of the 16th century the emphasis is on ''divisions'', also known as ''diminutions'', ''passaggi'' (in Italian), ''gorgia'' (\"throat\", first used as a term for vocal ornamentation by [[Nicola Vicentino]] in 1555), or ''glosas'' (by Ortiz, in both Spanish and Italian) \u2013 a way to decorate a simple cadence or interval with extra shorter notes. These start as simple passing notes, progress to step-wise additions and in the most complicated cases are rapid passages of equal valued notes \u2013 virtuosic flourishes. There are rules for designing them, to make sure that the original structure of the music is left intact. Towards the end of this period the divisions detailed in the treatises contain more dotted and other uneven rhythms and leaps of more than one step at a time.\n\nStarting with Archilei (1589),{{Full citation needed|date=May 2012}}<!--nothing by Archilei is found in the following list.--> the treatises bring in a new set of expressive devices called ''graces'' alongside the divisions.

Most ornaments occur on the beat, and use diatonic intervals more exclusively than ornaments in later periods do. While any table of ornaments must give a strict presentation, consideration has to be given to the tempo and note length, since at rapid tempos it would be difficult or impossible to play all of the notes that are usually required. One realisation of some common Baroque ornaments is set in the following table from the ''[[Klavierb\u00fcchlein f\u00fcr Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S.

Even in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s compositions, there is no ornament that come from outside of the score are allowed, as Brown explains: \"Most of the [[chamber music]] from Mozart onwards that still remains in the repertoire belongs to the kind in which every note is thought out' and which tolerates virtually no ornamental additions of the type under consideration here...\"{{sfn|Brown|2004|pages=415\u2013425}} Recent scholarship has however brought this statement in question.<ref>{{citation|last1=Levin |first1=Robert|author-link=Robert D.

One of the most unusual forms of ornamentation in world music is the Carnatic ''kampitam'' which is about oscillating a note in diverse ways by varying amplitude, speed or number of times the note is oscillated. This is a highly subtle, yet scientific ornamentation as the same note can be oscillated in different ways based on the raga or context within a raga.
