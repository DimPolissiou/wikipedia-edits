It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].

Its chief geographical features are [[Coologe]] Lake, Derrycassan Lake and [[Camagh]] Lough. Derrycassan is traversed by a public road and several rural lanes. The townland covers 498 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe earliest surviving mention of the townland name is ''Doire Cas\u00e1in'', which appears in an interesting list of the rents  due to the McGovern Chief, [[Maghnus 'Ruadh' M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]] about 1400 A.D.<ref>{{Citation |author= L.

In the first Anglo-Burmese War (1824\u201326), British took control of the region. They first occupied Myeik town \u2013 the first town of Burma to become a part of British India in 1826. Thereafter, in 1941 during [[World War II]], the [[Japan]]ese occupied the Tenasserim region, and they held Burma from 1941 to 1945.

In the first Anglo-Burmese War (1824\u201326), British took control of the region. They first occupied Myeik town \u2013 the first town of Burma to become a part of British India in 1826. Thereafter, in 1941 during [[World War II]], the [[Japan]]ese occupied the Tenasserim region, and they held Burma from 1941 to 1945. After the war, in 1948, the region became independent from [[United Kingdom|Britain]].<ref name=River/><ref name= Grosberg/>\n\n==Economic development==\nThe main agricultural operations in the Tenasserim River valley include paddy rice, mostly near [[Tavoy]]; vegetables, coconuts, rubber, and teak.

In addition to Sana's popularity, Meskini has been praised for her portrayal of the character and her outstanding representation of Muslim youth within Western societies, but especially female Muslim teenagers living in Norway.\n\nSana's appearance and portrayal on a show as popular as Skam at a time which saw a rise in Islamophobia across the globe was marked by many as essential in challenging stereotypes of hijab-wearing Muslim women and provided non-Muslim Norwegians with an alternative representation of their Muslim neighbours.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Meskini, Iman}}\n[[Category:1997 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Norwegian people of Tunisian descent]]\n[[Category:University of Oslo alumni]]\n[[Category:21st-century Norwegian actresses]]\n[[Category:Norwegian television actresses]]\n[[Category:Norwegian Muslims]]\n\n\n{{Norway-actor-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Johnsoniensis", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePersonal Life:>life", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iman_Meskini"}
