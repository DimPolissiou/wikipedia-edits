[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[James K. Polk]] defeated [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] [[Henry Clay]] in a close contest turning on the controversial issues of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[Texas annexation|annexation]] of the [[Republic of Texas]].\n\nPresident [[John Tyler]]'s pursuit of Texas annexation threatened the unity of both major parties.  Annexation would geographically expand American slavery.  It also risked [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with Mexico]] while the United States engaged in sensitive possession and boundary negotiations with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], which controlled [[Canada]], over [[Oregon Country|Oregon]].  Texas annexation thus posed both domestic and foreign policy risks.  Both major parties had wings in the [[Northern United States|North]] and the [[Southern United States|South]], but the possibility of the expansion of slavery threatened a sectional split in each party. Expelled by the Whig Party after vetoing key Whig legislation and lacking a firm political base, Tyler hoped to use the annexation of Texas to win re-election as an independent or at least to have decisive, pro-Texas influence over the election.\n\nThe early leader for the Democratic nomination was former President [[Martin Van Buren]], but his rejection of Texas annexation damaged his candidacy. Opposition from former President [[Andrew Jackson]] and most Southern delegations, plus a nomination rule change likely specifically aimed to block him, prevented Van Buren from winning the necessary two-thirds vote of delegates to the [[1844 Democratic National Convention]]. The convention instead chose [[James K. Polk]], former [[Governor of Tennessee]] and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|U. S. House Speaker]], who emerged as the first [[dark horse]] nominee. Polk ran on a platform embracing popular commitment to expansion, often referred to as [[Manifest destiny|Manifest Destiny]]. Tyler dropped out of the race and endorsed Polk. The Whigs nominated [[Henry Clay]], a famous, long-time party leader who was the early favorite but who conspicuously waffled on Texas annexation. Though a Southerner from Kentucky and a slave owner, Clay chose to focus on the risks of annexation while claiming not to oppose it personally. His awkward, repeated attempts to adjust and finesse his position on Texas confused and alienated voters, contrasting negatively with Polk's consistent clarity.\n\nPolk successfully linked the [[Oregon boundary dispute|dispute]] with the United Kingdom over [[Oregon Country|Oregon]] with the Texas issue. The Democratic nominee thus united anti-slavery Northern expansionists, who demanded Oregon, with pro-slavery Southern expansionists who demanded Texas. In the national popular vote, Polk beat Clay by fewer than 40,000 votes, a margin of 1.4%. [[James G. Birney]] of the anti-slavery [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]] won 2.3% of the vote. As President, Polk completed American annexation of Texas, which was the proximate cause of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n==Background==\n===Gag rule and Texas annexation controversies===\nWhigs and Democrats embarked upon their campaigns during the climax of the congressional [[gag rule]] controversies in 1844, which prompted Southern congressmen to suppress northern petitions to end the slave trade in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 352: \"The Gag Rule Controversy had sketched the battle lines\" in the approaching crisis over slavery expansion in America and \"hardened contestants for the worse crisis looming over expansion in America \u2013 and slavery \u2013 in the Southwest [i.e. Texas.\" <br> Wilentz, 2008, p. 558: With \"the repeal of the gage rule, the conflict\" \u2013 i.e. whether American republicanism could tolerate American slavery \u2013 \"moved closer to becoming a permanent issue in national politics.\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 410: \"Artificially segregating Whigs' response to gag and Texas crises\u2026hinders awareness that the two issues came to a climax at the same time. The same Congress of 1844-45 which abolished the gag rule admitted Texas.\"</ref> Anti-annexation petitions to Congress sent from northern anti-slavery forces, including state legislatures, were similarly suppressed.<ref>May 2008, p. 97: \"\u2026eight [northern] state legislatures sent Congress petitions warning against [Texas annexation].\"</ref><ref>Miller, 1998, p. 285: \"There had already been\u2026resolutions by state legislatures that were summarily dismissed on the subject of Texas [annexation'.\"</ref> Intra-party sectional compromises and maneuvering on slavery politics during these divisive debates placed significant strain on the northern and southern wings that comprised each political organization.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 558: The Gag Rule debates caused \"the heightening of sectional tensions in Congress [making] it imperative that [Whigs] find some compromise middle ground in the 1844 campaign\u2026The same was true for Democrats\u2026\" Due to the Gag Rule controversies, \"Agitation over slavery on both sides was now fair play\" and the question arose: \"Could American democracy coexist with American slavery?\"</ref> The question as to whether the institution of slavery and its aristocratic principles of social authority were compatible with democratic republicanism was becoming \"a permanent issue in national politics\".<ref>Miller, 1998, p. 285: \"[I]f the annexation of Texas were to be discussed on the House floor it would certainly lead to a discussion of slavery \u2013 exactly the subject slaveholding congressmen wanted to avoid.\"</ref><ref>Widmer, 2005, p. 15: In the early 1840s \"it had become clear that an apocalyptic battle was looming between\u2026 Union and Slavery\u2026\"</ref>\n\nIn 1836, a portion of the Mexican state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]] declared its independence to form the [[Republic of Texas]]. Texans, mostly American immigrants from the Deep South, many of whom owned slaves, sought to bring their republic into the Union as a state. At first, the subject of annexing Texas to the United States was shunned by both major American political parties.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 561: \"Texas annexation had long been a taboo subject for Whigs and Democrats alike.\"</ref> Although they recognized Texas sovereignty, Presidents Andrew Jackson (1829\u20131837) and Martin Van Buren (1837\u20131841) declined to pursue annexation.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 560: Jackson was \"happy to recognize the new Texas republic but refused to annex it because it could well lead to war with Mexico.\" An event \"both Jackson and Van Buren wanted to avoid</ref><ref>Meacham, 2008 p. 324: \"[[Stephen F. Austin|Stephen Austin]] implored Jackson to militarily support Texas independence 1836. The president commented: \"[Austin] does not reflect that we have a treaty with Mexico and our national faith is pledged to support it.\"</ref> The prospect of bringing another slave state into the Union was fraught with problems.<ref>Widmer, 2005, p. 148: \"There were a number of very good reasons to oppose taking Texas\u2026\"</ref> Both major parties \u2013 the Democrats and Whigs \u2013 viewed Texas statehood as something \"not worth a foreign war [with Mexico]\" or the \"sectional combat\" that annexation would provoke in the United States.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 560: \"\u2026both Jackson and Van Buren would avoid\u2026war with Mexico.\" <br /> Freehling, 1991, p. 367: \"Jackson was a partisan of annexation\u2026but\u2026delayed\u2026\" <br /> May, 2008, p. 97: \"As much as [US President] Jackson wanted Texas, he would not pay the price of a war abroad or at home.\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 367-368: During his presidency, Van Buren considered Texas annexation \"potentially poisonous to American Union\u2026\"</ref>\n\n===Tyler\u2013Texas treaty===\nThe incumbent President [[John Tyler]], formerly vice-president, had assumed the presidency upon the death of [[William Henry Harrison]] in 1841. Tyler, a Whig in name only,<ref>Finkelman. 2011, p. 28: \"Never truly a Whig, Tyler opposed almost every policy the party stood for.\"</ref> emerged as a states' rights advocate committed to slavery expansion in defiance of his party's principles.<ref>Holt, 2005, p. 10: Tyler was \"\u2026deeply devoted to the perpetuation of slavery\u2026\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 410: \"\u2026Northern Whigs had warned that Texas would be the Slavepower's next outsized demand after the gag rule\u2026Whigs Northern and Southern had loathed Tyler as a slayer of their popular mandate.\"</ref> After he vetoed the Whig domestic legislative agenda, he was expelled from his own party on September 13, 1841.<ref>Holt, 2005, p. 10: In response to Tyler's vetoes \"Whig congressmen and most state Whig organizations formally read Tyler out of the Whig Party.\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 364: Tyler was \"almost unanimously excommunicated\u2026from the [Whig] party.\"</ref> Politically isolated, but unencumbered by party restraints,<ref>Merry, 2009, p. 67 \"[Tyler], refusing to embrace the Whig agenda\u2026had essentially become a president without a party, and a president without a party couldn\u2019t govern effectively.\"<br>Finkelman. 2011, p. 28: \"The knowledge that he would never gain the Whig presidential nomination liberated Tyler to move forward on annexation\u2026\"</ref> Tyler aligned himself with a small faction of Texas annexationists<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 355-356: \"Tyler and his southern advisers \"were composed of a few states' rights Whigs and fewer disgruntled Democrats\u2026These alarmists controlled the presidency. They dominated nothing else.\"</ref> in a bid for election to a full term in 1844.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p.402: \"Sam Houston's movement away from [annexation by] the United States left the American establishment [i.e. Whigs and Democrats] to avoid the problem. The Tyler administration had to [secure an annexation treaty with Texas] before debate could be compelled in America.\"</ref><ref>Holt, 2005, p. 10: \"\u2026Tyler hit upon the annexation of Texas as an issue on which he might win the presidency in 1844.\"</ref><ref>May 2008, p. 99: \"Tyler desperately wanted to win election in 1844 and believed that acquiring Texas would earn him favor.\"</ref>\n\nTyler became convinced that Great Britain was encouraging a Texas\u2013Mexico rapprochement that might lead to slave emancipation in the Texas republic.<ref>Finkelman, 2011, p. 30: \"Some southerners argued that Britain would end slavery in Texas and this would lead to slaves fleeing [from US slave states] to the Republic of Texas. The predictions helped the lame-duck Tyler convince a lame-duck Congress to annex Texas.\"</ref><ref>Holt, 2005, p. 10: \"England's repeated attempts to persuade authorities in the Republic of Texas to abolish slavery\u2026influenced him [Tyler]\" to seek annexation.</ref> Accordingly, he directed [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Abel P. Upshur]] of Virginia to initiate, then relentlessly pursue, secret annexation talks<ref>Finkelman, 2001, p. 28-29: \"\u2026in 1843 [Tyler] began secret negotiations with Texas.\"</ref><ref>May 2008, p. 112:\"Tyler's furtive negotiations with the Texans\u2026\" on the annexation treaty.</ref> with Texas minister to the United States [[Isaac Van Zandt]], beginning on October 16, 1843.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 398: \"On October 16 Upshur met with Texas Minister Van Zandt and urged immediate negotiations towards an annexation treaty.\"</ref>\n\nTyler submitted his Texas-US treaty for annexation to the US Senate, delivered April 22, 1844, where a two-thirds majority was required for ratification.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 408: \"On April 22, 1844, the Senate received the pre-treaty correspondence [and] the [Tyler] treaty\u2026\"</ref><ref>Finkelman, 2011, p. 29: \"A treaty required a two-thirds majority [in the Senate] for ratification.\"</ref> The newly appointed Secretary of State [[John C. Calhoun]] of South Carolina (assuming his post March 29, 1844)<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 407: \"The new Secretary of State [Calhoun] reached Washington March 29, 1844.\"</ref> included a document known as the Packenham Letter with the Tyler bill that was calculated to inject a sense of crisis in Southern Democrats of the [[Deep South]].<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 415: \"\u2026Calhoun could only begin to provoke a 'sense of crisis' with southern Democrats\", and \"The Packenham Letter could rally southern Democrats against the party's northern establishment\u2026\" <br /> May, 2008, p. 113: \"The Packenham Letter proved the claims of anit-annexationists and abolitionists that the Texas question was only about slavery - its expansion and preservation - despite Tyler's protestations to the contrary.\"</ref> In it, he characterized slavery as a social blessing and the acquisition of Texas as an emergency measure necessary to safeguard the \"peculiar institution\" in the United States.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 408: The Packenham Letter \"declared the national [Texas] treaty a sectional weapon, designed to protect slavery's blessings from England's documented interference\" and \"aimed at driving southerners to see England's soft threat in a hard-headed way.\"</ref><ref>May 2008, p. 112-113: \"Calhoun\u2026insisted that the'peculiar institution' was, in fact, 'a political institution necessary to peace, safety and prosperity.\"</ref> In doing so, Tyler and Calhoun sought to unite the South in a crusade that would present the North with an ultimatum: support Texas annexation or lose the South.<ref>Freehling, 2008, p. 409-410: \"Nothing would have made Northern Whigs tolerate the [Packenham] document, and Northern Democrats would have to be forced to swallow their distaste for the accord. Calhoun's scenario of rallying enough slaveholders to push enough Northern Democrats to stop evading the issue was exactly the way the election of 1844 and annexation aftermath transpired.\"</ref> Anti-slavery Whigs considered Texas annexation particularly egregious, since Mexico had outlawed slavery in Coahuila y Tejas in 1829, before Texas independence had been declared.\n\nThe 1844 presidential campaigns evolved within the context of this struggle over Texas annexation, which was tied to the question of slavery expansion and national security.<ref>Finkelman. 2011, p. 26: \"James K. Polk's victory over Henry Clay in 1844 was directly tied to the Texas annexation question.\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 424: Texas \"was politically and economically sublime for slavery; and annexationists demanded the soil\u2026\"</ref> All candidates in the 1844 presidential election had to declare a position on this explosive issue.<ref>Widmer, 2005, p. 148: \"Texas\u2026forced all candidates to declare whether they were for or against annexation\"</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2008: \"Instantly, the letter became a public litmus test\" for both national parties: \"support Texas and it pro-slavery rationale and alienate the North, or oppose it and forever lose the South.\"</ref>\n\n==Nominations==\n\n===Democratic Party convention campaign===\n{{main|1844 Democratic National Convention}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:DemocraticLogo.svg|65px|center|link=Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party (United States)]]<big>'''Democratic Party Ticket, 1844'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#34AAE0; width:200px;\"| [[James K.

Van Buren, initially the leading candidate, opposed immediate annexation because it might lead to a sectional crisis over the status of slavery in the West and lead to war with Mexico. This position cost Van Buren the support of southern and expansionist Democrats; as a result, he failed to win the nomination.  The delegates likewise could not settle on [[Lewis Cass]], the former [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], whose credentials also included past service as a [[List of ambassadors of the United States to France|U.S. minister to France]].\n\nOn the eighth ballot, the historian [[George Bancroft]], a delegate from Massachusetts, proposed former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[James K. Polk]] as a compromise candidate. Polk argued that Texas and Oregon had always belonged to the United States by right. He called for \"the immediate re-annexation of Texas\" and for the \"re-occupation\" of the [[Oregon boundary dispute|disputed Oregon territory]].\n\nOn the next roll call, the convention unanimously accepted Polk, who became the first [[dark horse]], or little-known, presidential candidate.<ref>Widmer, 2005, p. 150 \"\u2026the original 'dark horse' candidate.\"</ref> The delegates selected Senator [[Silas Wright]] of New York for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], but Wright, an admirer of Van Buren, declined the nomination to become the first person to decline a vice presidential nomination.

To ensure the success of their southern strategy, the Democrats also muffled John Tyler.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 573</ref>}}Beyond his actual platform, Polk pledged to serve only one term as President.

He would also deny Texas entrance in the Union, no matter whether Mexico agreed, should 'a considerable and respectable portion' of the American people \"express 'decided opposition'\"</ref>\n\nThe Whig party leadership was acutely aware that any proslavery legislation advanced by its southern wing would alienate its anti-slavery northern wing and cripple the party in the general election.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 426\u2013427: \"Southern Whigs thus had to weigh the possibility that Texas might be abolitionized [by Great Britain] against the certainty that campaigning for [Texas] annexation would split their party.\"</ref> In order to preserve their party, Whigs would need to stand squarely against acquiring a new slave state. As such, Whigs were content to restrict their 1844 campaign platform to less divisive issues such as [[internal improvements]] and national finance.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 568-569: \"The Texas issue struck [Clay] as a giant distraction from the real issues\u2026internal improvements, the tariff and the rest of the American System\u2026\" and \"ratified a four-part unity platform\" based on the \"American System.\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 353, p. 355, p. 436</ref><ref>Finkelman. 2011, p. 22: \"The Whigs wanted to talk about the tariff and currency, which were no longer exciting issues.\"</ref>\n\nWhigs picked [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]] of New Jersey \u2013 \"the Christian Statesman\" \u2013 as Clay's running mate. An advocate of the [[American Colonization Society|colonization]] of emancipated slaves, he was acceptable to southern Whigs as an opponent of the abolitionists.<ref>Finkelman, 2008, p. 21: \"\u2026as an avid colonizationist [Freylinghuysen's] conservative views on slavery made him acceptable to southerners, and at the convention, almost all southern delegates voted for him.\" And p. 19-20: \"\u2026he was clearly an opponest of the abolitionists.\"</ref> His pious reputation balanced Clay's image as a slave-holding, hard-drinking duelist.<ref>Finkelman. 2011, p. 17, p. 21: Freylinghuysen \"the perfect northerner to balance the somewhat sordid reputation of the slaveowning, dueling, hard-drinking Clay.\"</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 569: Freylinghuysen served to \"offset Clay's reputation for moral laxity\u2026\"</ref>\nTheir party slogan was the bland \"Hurray, Hurray, the Country's Risin' \u2013 Vote for Clay and Frelinghuysen!\"<ref>Finkelman. 2011, p. 22: The \"less than snappy slogan\u2026\"</ref>\n\n====Henry Clay's Alabama letter====\nOn July 27, 1844, Henry Clay, in the midst of his campaign against James K. Polk, released a position statement, the so-called Alabama Letter. In it, he counseled his Whig constituency to regard Texas annexation and statehood as merely a short phase in the decline of slavery in the United States, rather than a long term advance for the [[Slave Power]].<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 435: \"Even anti-slavery American should consent to annexation counseled Clay\" because diffusion of slavery south into the tropics would \"doom slavery in Texas.\"</ref> Clay qualified his stance on Texas annexation, declaring \"no personal objection to the annexation\" of the republic. He would move back to his original orientation in September 1844.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 435: \"Clay admitted he would be glad to see [Texas annexation], without dishonor, without war [and] with the common consent of the American people.\" And p. 436: \"In September\u2026he re-emphasised opposition to annexation\u2026\"</ref> Northern Whigs expressed outrage at any d\u00e9tente with the Slave Power and accused him of equivocating on Texas annexation.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 435: \"Northern Whigs, enraged by Clays' newly announced personal preference for Texas, accused Clay of waffling\u2026\"</ref>\n\nClay's central position, however, had not altered: no annexation without northern acquiescence. Clay's commitment brought Southern Whigs under extreme pressure in their home states and congressional districts, threatening to tarnish their credentials as supporters of slavery.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 437: \"In 1844, Whigs stood damned as soft on Texas, therefore soft on slavery.\"</ref><ref>Holt, 2008, p. 12-13: Fearing to be cast as \"soft on slavery\" (see Freehling, 1991, p. 437), \"southern Whigs could be portrayed as even more ardent champions of slavery in the South than the southern Democrats. As would happen in the future, slavery extension became a political weapon [which] rival parties used to exploit for political reasons\u2026\"</ref>\n\n====Whig Party campaign tactics====\nHistorian Sean Wilentz describes some of the Whig campaign tactics:\n{{quote|\"The Whigs countered Democratic attacks by revving up the Log Cabin electioneering machinery and redeploying it on behalf of the man they now celebrated as 'Ol'Coon' Clay. They also attacked former House Speaker Polk as nobody who deep down was a dangerous [[Locofocos|Loco Foco]] radical\u2026With greater success, the Whigs linked up with resurgent [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] anti-Catholic movement strongest in New York and Pennsylvania, and planted stories that as president, Clay would tighten up immigration and naturalization laws. (Too late, Clay tried to distance himself from the nativists.)\"\n\n\"The Liberty Party added to the confusion\u2026Clay became the object of nasty abolitionist attacks. One notorious handbill, widely reprinted, by an abolitionist minister [[Abel J. Brown|Abel Brown]], denounced Clay as a \"''Man Stealer, Slaveholder, and Murdurer,''\" and accused him of \"Selling Jesus Christ!\" because he dealt in slaves. With the campaign to be decided at the electoral margins, Whig managers grew so concerned that, late in the campaign, they concocted a fraudulent letter that supposedly proved that James Birney was secretly working in league with the Democrats, and circulated it in New York and Ohio.\"<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 573</ref>}}\n\n===National Democratic-Republican Party campaign and convention===\n====\"Tyler and Texas\"====\n[[File:John Tyler.png|thumb|right|180px|Incumbent President John Tyler, the [[Democratic-Republican Party (1844)|Democratic-Republican Party]] presidential nominee]]\nAfter the closed session Senate debates on the Tyler-Texas treaty were leaked to the public on April 27, 1844, President Tyler's only hope of success in influencing passage of his treaty was to intervene directly as candidate in the 1844 election as [[Kingmaker]].<ref>May 2008, p. 113: \"Tyler, all hope of success nearly gone, had only one option left \u2013 to launch his own party and attempt to act as spoiler in the November presidential contest.\"</ref> His [[Democratic-Republican Party (1844)|\"Democratic-Republican Party\"]], a recycling of the name of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s party,<ref>May, 2008, p. 113: \"\u2026so-called Democratic-Republican Party; the name a tribute to [Tyler's] beloved Jefferson\u2026\"</ref> held its convention on May 27, 1844, in Baltimore, Maryland, a short distance from the unfolding Democratic Party convention that would select James K. Polk as nominee. Tyler was nominated the same day without challenge, accepting the honor on May 30, 1844. He designated no vice-presidential running mate.<ref>May 2008, p. 114: Tyler \"did not select a running mate.\"</ref>\n\nDemocratic Party nominee James K. Polk was faced with the possibility that a Tyler ticket might shift votes away from the Democrats and provide Clay with the margin of victory in a close race. Tyler made clear in his convention acceptance speech that his overriding concern was the ratification of his Texas annexation treaty. Moreover, he hinted that he would drop out of the race once that end was assured, informing Polk, through Senator [[Robert J. Walker]] of Mississippi, that his campaign efforts were simply a vehicle to mobilize support for Texas annexation.<ref>May 2008, p. 119: \"The more Tyler could challenge Polk's chances the more certain he was that Polk would deliver on annexation\u2026\"</ref> Tyler concentrated his resources in the states of New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, all highly contested states in the election. Securing enough Democratic support, his withdrawal might prove indispensable to Polk.\n\nPolk was receptive as long as Tyler could withdraw without raising suspicion of a secret bargain.<ref>May 2008, p. 119-120: \"All that Polk needed was a mechanism that would allow Tyler to gracefully drop out of the race without reviving suspicions of a corrupt bargain.\"</ref> To solidify Tyler's cooperation, Polk enlisted Andrew Jackson to reassure Tyler that Texas annexation would be consummated under a Polk administration. On August 20, 1844, Tyler dropped out of the presidential race, and Tylerites moved quickly to support the Democratic Party nominee.<ref>May 2008, p. 120: \"Tyler supporters easily switched their allegiance to Polk\u2026\"</ref>\n\n===Other nominations===\n{{main|Joseph Smith 1844 presidential campaign}}\nThe abolitionist lawyer and publisher [[James G.

The votes he won were more than the difference in votes between Henry Clay and James K.

The former slaveholder, now abolitionist, James Birney of the Liberty Party, received 15,812 and 3,632 votes, respectively, on the basis of his unwavering stand against Texas annexation.\n\nPolk won by a mere 5,106 out of 470,062 cast in New York, and only 3,422 out of 52,096 votes in Michigan.<ref>Finkelman, 2011, p. 19: \"The northern Democrats could on the explicitly anti-slavery Liberty Party to\u2026possibly siphon off anti-slavery Whig votes.\"</ref> Had enough of these voting blocks cast their ballots for the anti-annexationist Clay in either state, he would have defeated Polk.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 574: \"Had only a modest proportion of the Liberty Party's New York vote\u2026gone instead to the Whigs, Henry Clay would have been elected president.\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 438: \"The shift of [either] of these states' 41 electoral votes would have transformed a 170-105 Polk Electoral victory into a 146-129 Clay triumph.\"</ref> Still, Clay's opposition to annexation and western slavery expansion served him well among Northern Whigs and nearly secured him the election.<ref>Holt, 2005, p. 11-12</ref>\n\nThis was the last election in which Ohio voted for the Whigs and the last time that it voted against the Democrats until it voted Republican in 1856. It was also the only presidential election in which the winner, Polk, lost both his birth state of North Carolina and his state of residence, Tennessee, (which he lost by only 123 votes) prior to [[Donald Trump|Donald Trump's]] victory in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].

[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[James K. Polk]] defeated [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] [[Henry Clay]] in a close contest turning on the controversial issues of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[Texas annexation|annexation]] of the [[Republic of Texas]].\n\nPresident [[John Tyler]]'s pursuit of Texas annexation threatened the unity of both major parties.  Annexation would geographically expand American slavery.  It also risked [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with Mexico]] while the United States engaged in sensitive possession and boundary negotiations with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], which controlled [[Canada]], over [[Oregon Country|Oregon]].  Texas annexation thus posed both domestic and foreign policy risks.  Both major parties had wings in the [[Northern United States|North]] and the [[Southern United States|South]], but the possibility of the expansion of slavery threatened a sectional split in each party. Expelled by the Whig Party after vetoing key Whig legislation and lacking a firm political base, Tyler hoped to use the annexation of Texas to win re-election as an independent or at least to have decisive, pro-Texas influence over the election.\n\nThe early leader for the Democratic nomination was former President [[Martin Van Buren]], but his rejection of Texas annexation damaged his candidacy. Opposition from former President [[Andrew Jackson]] and most Southern delegations, plus a nomination rule change likely specifically aimed to block him, prevented Van Buren from winning the necessary two-thirds vote of delegates to the [[1844 Democratic National Convention]]. The convention instead chose [[James K. Polk]], former [[Governor of Tennessee]] and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|U. S. House Speaker]], who emerged as the first [[dark horse]] nominee. Polk ran on a platform embracing popular commitment to expansion, often referred to as [[Manifest destiny|Manifest Destiny]]. Tyler dropped out of the race and endorsed Polk. The Whigs nominated [[Henry Clay]], a famous, long-time party leader who was the early favorite but who conspicuously waffled on Texas annexation. Though a Southerner from Kentucky and a slave owner, Clay chose to focus on the risks of annexation while claiming not to oppose it personally. His awkward, repeated attempts to adjust and finesse his position on Texas confused and alienated voters, contrasting negatively with Polk's consistent clarity.\n\nPolk successfully linked the [[Oregon boundary dispute|dispute]] with the United Kingdom over [[Oregon Country|Oregon]] with the Texas issue. The Democratic nominee thus united anti-slavery Northern expansionists, who demanded Oregon, with pro-slavery Southern expansionists who demanded Texas. In the national popular vote, Polk beat Clay by fewer than 40,000 votes, a margin of 1.4%. [[James G. Birney]] of the anti-slavery [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]] won 2.3% of the vote. As President, Polk completed American annexation of Texas, which was the proximate cause of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n==Background==\n===Gag rule and Texas annexation controversies===\nWhigs and Democrats embarked upon their campaigns during the climax of the congressional [[gag rule]] controversies in 1844, which prompted Southern congressmen to suppress northern petitions to end the slave trade in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 352: \"The Gag Rule Controversy had sketched the battle lines\" in the approaching crisis over slavery expansion in America and \"hardened contestants for the worse crisis looming over expansion in America \u2013 and slavery \u2013 in the Southwest [i.e. Texas.\" <br> Wilentz, 2008, p. 558: With \"the repeal of the gage rule, the conflict\" \u2013 i.e. whether American republicanism could tolerate American slavery \u2013 \"moved closer to becoming a permanent issue in national politics.\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 410: \"Artificially segregating Whigs' response to gag and Texas crises\u2026hinders awareness that the two issues came to a climax at the same time. The same Congress of 1844-45 which abolished the gag rule admitted Texas.\"</ref> Anti-annexation petitions to Congress sent from northern anti-slavery forces, including state legislatures, were similarly suppressed.<ref>May 2008, p. 97: \"\u2026eight [northern] state legislatures sent Congress petitions warning against [Texas annexation].\"</ref><ref>Miller, 1998, p. 285: \"There had already been\u2026resolutions by state legislatures that were summarily dismissed on the subject of Texas [annexation'.\"</ref> Intra-party sectional compromises and maneuvering on slavery politics during these divisive debates placed significant strain on the northern and southern wings that comprised each political organization.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 558: The Gag Rule debates caused \"the heightening of sectional tensions in Congress [making] it imperative that [Whigs] find some compromise middle ground in the 1844 campaign\u2026The same was true for Democrats\u2026\" Due to the Gag Rule controversies, \"Agitation over slavery on both sides was now fair play\" and the question arose: \"Could American democracy coexist with American slavery?\"</ref> The question as to whether the institution of slavery and its aristocratic principles of social authority were compatible with democratic republicanism was becoming \"a permanent issue in national politics\".<ref>Miller, 1998, p. 285: \"[I]f the annexation of Texas were to be discussed on the House floor it would certainly lead to a discussion of slavery \u2013 exactly the subject slaveholding congressmen wanted to avoid.\"</ref><ref>Widmer, 2005, p. 15: In the early 1840s \"it had become clear that an apocalyptic battle was looming between\u2026 Union and Slavery\u2026\"</ref>\n\nIn 1836, a portion of the Mexican state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]] declared its independence to form the [[Republic of Texas]]. Texans, mostly American immigrants from the Deep South, many of whom owned slaves, sought to bring their republic into the Union as a state. At first, the subject of annexing Texas to the United States was shunned by both major American political parties.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 561: \"Texas annexation had long been a taboo subject for Whigs and Democrats alike.\"</ref> Although they recognized Texas sovereignty, Presidents Andrew Jackson (1829\u20131837) and Martin Van Buren (1837\u20131841) declined to pursue annexation.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 560: Jackson was \"happy to recognize the new Texas republic but refused to annex it because it could well lead to war with Mexico.\" An event \"both Jackson and Van Buren wanted to avoid</ref><ref>Meacham, 2008 p. 324: \"[[Stephen F. Austin|Stephen Austin]] implored Jackson to militarily support Texas independence 1836. The president commented: \"[Austin] does not reflect that we have a treaty with Mexico and our national faith is pledged to support it.\"</ref> The prospect of bringing another slave state into the Union was fraught with problems.<ref>Widmer, 2005, p. 148: \"There were a number of very good reasons to oppose taking Texas\u2026\"</ref> Both major parties \u2013 the Democrats and Whigs \u2013 viewed Texas statehood as something \"not worth a foreign war [with Mexico]\" or the \"sectional combat\" that annexation would provoke in the United States.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 560: \"\u2026both Jackson and Van Buren would avoid\u2026war with Mexico.\" <br /> Freehling, 1991, p. 367: \"Jackson was a partisan of annexation\u2026but\u2026delayed\u2026\" <br /> May, 2008, p. 97: \"As much as [US President] Jackson wanted Texas, he would not pay the price of a war abroad or at home.\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 367-368: During his presidency, Van Buren considered Texas annexation \"potentially poisonous to American Union\u2026\"</ref>\n\n===Tyler\u2013Texas treaty===\nThe incumbent President [[John Tyler]], formerly vice-president, had assumed the presidency upon the death of [[William Henry Harrison]] in 1841. Tyler, a Whig in name only,<ref>Finkelman. 2011, p. 28: \"Never truly a Whig, Tyler opposed almost every policy the party stood for.\"</ref> emerged as a states' rights advocate committed to slavery expansion in defiance of his party's principles.<ref>Holt, 2005, p. 10: Tyler was \"\u2026deeply devoted to the perpetuation of slavery\u2026\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 410: \"\u2026Northern Whigs had warned that Texas would be the Slavepower's next outsized demand after the gag rule\u2026Whigs Northern and Southern had loathed Tyler as a slayer of their popular mandate.\"</ref> After he vetoed the Whig domestic legislative agenda, he was expelled from his own party on September 13, 1841.<ref>Holt, 2005, p. 10: In response to Tyler's vetoes \"Whig congressmen and most state Whig organizations formally read Tyler out of the Whig Party.\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 364: Tyler was \"almost unanimously excommunicated\u2026from the [Whig] party.\"</ref> Politically isolated, but unencumbered by party restraints,<ref>Merry, 2009, p. 67 \"[Tyler], refusing to embrace the Whig agenda\u2026had essentially become a president without a party, and a president without a party couldn\u2019t govern effectively.\"<br>Finkelman. 2011, p. 28: \"The knowledge that he would never gain the Whig presidential nomination liberated Tyler to move forward on annexation\u2026\"</ref> Tyler aligned himself with a small faction of Texas annexationists<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 355-356: \"Tyler and his southern advisers \"were composed of a few states' rights Whigs and fewer disgruntled Democrats\u2026These alarmists controlled the presidency.

The Tyler administration had to [secure an annexation treaty with Texas] before debate could be compelled in America.\"</ref><ref>Holt, 2005, p. 10: \"\u2026Tyler hit upon the annexation of Texas as an issue on which he might win the presidency in 1844.\"</ref><ref>May 2008, p. 99: \"Tyler desperately wanted to win election in 1844 and believed that acquiring Texas would earn him favor.\"</ref>\n\nTyler became convinced that Great Britain was encouraging a Texas\u2013Mexico rapprochement that might lead to slave emancipation in the Texas republic.<ref>Finkelman, 2011, p. 30: \"Some southerners argued that Britain would end slavery in Texas and this would lead to slaves fleeing [from US slave states] to the Republic of Texas. The predictions helped the lame-duck Tyler convince a lame-duck Congress to annex Texas.\"</ref><ref>Holt, 2005, p. 10: \"England's repeated attempts to persuade authorities in the Republic of Texas to abolish slavery\u2026influenced him [Tyler]\" to seek annexation.</ref> Accordingly, he directed [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Abel P. Upshur]] of Virginia to initiate, then relentlessly pursue, secret annexation talks<ref>Finkelman, 2001, p. 28-29: \"\u2026in 1843 [Tyler] began secret negotiations with Texas.\"</ref><ref>May 2008, p. 112:\"Tyler's furtive negotiations with the Texans\u2026\" on the annexation treaty.</ref> with Texas minister to the United States [[Isaac Van Zandt]], beginning on October 16, 1843.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 398: \"On October 16 Upshur met with Texas Minister Van Zandt and urged immediate negotiations towards an annexation treaty.\"</ref>\n\nTyler submitted his Texas-US treaty for annexation to the US Senate, delivered April 22, 1844, where a two-thirds majority was required for ratification.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 408: \"On April 22, 1844, the Senate received the pre-treaty correspondence [and] the [Tyler] treaty\u2026\"</ref><ref>Finkelman, 2011, p. 29: \"A treaty required a two-thirds majority [in the Senate] for ratification.\"</ref> The newly appointed Secretary of State [[John C.

Calhoun's scenario of rallying enough slaveholders to push enough Northern Democrats to stop evading the issue was exactly the way the election of 1844 and annexation aftermath transpired.\"</ref> Anti-slavery Whigs considered Texas annexation particularly egregious, since Mexico had outlawed slavery in Coahuila y Tejas in 1829, before Texas independence had been declared.\n\nThe 1844 presidential campaigns evolved within the context of this struggle over Texas annexation, which was tied to the question of slavery expansion and national security.<ref>Finkelman. 2011, p. 26: \"James K. Polk's victory over Henry Clay in 1844 was directly tied to the Texas annexation question.\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 424: Texas \"was politically and economically sublime for slavery; and annexationists demanded the soil\u2026\"</ref> All candidates in the 1844 presidential election had to declare a position on this explosive issue.<ref>Widmer, 2005, p. 148: \"Texas\u2026forced all candidates to declare whether they were for or against annexation\"</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2008: \"Instantly, the letter became a public litmus test\" for both national parties: \"support Texas and it pro-slavery rationale and alienate the North, or oppose it and forever lose the South.\"</ref>\n\n==Nominations==\n\n===Democratic Party convention campaign===\n{{main|1844 Democratic National Convention}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:DemocraticLogo.svg|65px|center|link=Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party (United States)]]<big>'''Democratic Party Ticket, 1844'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#34AAE0; width:200px;\"| [[James K.

Van Buren, initially the leading candidate, opposed immediate annexation because it might lead to a sectional crisis over the status of slavery in the West and lead to war with Mexico. This position cost Van Buren the support of southern and expansionist Democrats; as a result, he failed to win the nomination.  The delegates likewise could not settle on [[Lewis Cass]], the former [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], whose credentials also included past service as a [[List of ambassadors of the United States to France|U.S. minister to France]].\n\nOn the eighth ballot, the historian [[George Bancroft]], a delegate from Massachusetts, proposed former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[James K. Polk]] as a compromise candidate. Polk argued that Texas and Oregon had always belonged to the United States by right. He called for \"the immediate re-annexation of Texas\" and for the \"re-occupation\" of the [[Oregon boundary dispute|disputed Oregon territory]].\n\nOn the next roll call, the convention unanimously accepted Polk, who became the first [[dark horse]], or little-known, presidential candidate.<ref>Widmer, 2005, p. 150 \"\u2026the original 'dark horse' candidate.\"</ref> The delegates selected Senator [[Silas Wright]] of New York for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], but Wright, an admirer of Van Buren, declined the nomination to become the first person to decline a vice presidential nomination.

He would move back to his original orientation in September 1844.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 435: \"Clay admitted he would be glad to see [Texas annexation], without dishonor, without war [and] with the common consent of the American people.\" And p. 436: \"In September\u2026he re-emphasised opposition to annexation\u2026\"</ref> Northern Whigs expressed outrage at any d\u00e9tente with the Slave Power and accused him of equivocating on Texas annexation.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 435: \"Northern Whigs, enraged by Clays' newly announced personal preference for Texas, accused Clay of waffling\u2026\"</ref>\n\nClay's central position, however, had not altered: no annexation without northern acquiescence. Clay's commitment brought Southern Whigs under extreme pressure in their home states and congressional districts, threatening to tarnish their credentials as supporters of slavery.<ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 437: \"In 1844, Whigs stood damned as soft on Texas, therefore soft on slavery.\"</ref><ref>Holt, 2008, p. 12-13: Fearing to be cast as \"soft on slavery\" (see Freehling, 1991, p. 437), \"southern Whigs could be portrayed as even more ardent champions of slavery in the South than the southern Democrats.

He designated no vice-presidential running mate.<ref>May 2008, p. 114: Tyler \"did not select a running mate.\"</ref>\n\nDemocratic Party nominee James K. Polk was faced with the possibility that a Tyler ticket might shift votes away from the Democrats and provide Clay with the margin of victory in a close race. Tyler made clear in his convention acceptance speech that his overriding concern was the ratification of his Texas annexation treaty. Moreover, he hinted that he would drop out of the race once that end was assured, informing Polk, through Senator [[Robert J. Walker]] of Mississippi, that his campaign efforts were simply a vehicle to mobilize support for Texas annexation.<ref>May 2008, p. 119: \"The more Tyler could challenge Polk's chances the more certain he was that Polk would deliver on annexation\u2026\"</ref> Tyler concentrated his resources in the states of New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, all highly contested states in the election. Securing enough Democratic support, his withdrawal might prove indispensable to Polk.\n\nPolk was receptive as long as Tyler could withdraw without raising suspicion of a secret bargain.<ref>May 2008, p. 119-120: \"All that Polk needed was a mechanism that would allow Tyler to gracefully drop out of the race without reviving suspicions of a corrupt bargain.\"</ref> To solidify Tyler's cooperation, Polk enlisted Andrew Jackson to reassure Tyler that Texas annexation would be consummated under a Polk administration. On August 20, 1844, Tyler dropped out of the presidential race, and Tylerites moved quickly to support the Democratic Party nominee.<ref>May 2008, p. 120: \"Tyler supporters easily switched their allegiance to Polk\u2026\"</ref>\n\n===Other nominations===\n{{main|Joseph Smith 1844 presidential campaign}}\nThe abolitionist lawyer and publisher [[James G.

The former slaveholder, now abolitionist, James Birney of the Liberty Party, received 15,812 and 3,632 votes, respectively, on the basis of his unwavering stand against Texas annexation.\n\nPolk won by a mere 5,106 out of 470,062 cast in New York, and only 3,422 out of 52,096 votes in Michigan.<ref>Finkelman, 2011, p. 19: \"The northern Democrats could on the explicitly anti-slavery Liberty Party to\u2026possibly siphon off anti-slavery Whig votes.\"</ref> Had enough of these voting blocks cast their ballots for the anti-annexationist Clay in either state, he would have defeated Polk.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 574: \"Had only a modest proportion of the Liberty Party's New York vote\u2026gone instead to the Whigs, Henry Clay would have been elected president.\"</ref><ref>Freehling, 1991, p. 438: \"The shift of [either] of these states' 41 electoral votes would have transformed a 170-105 Polk Electoral victory into a 146-129 Clay triumph.\"</ref> Still, Clay's opposition to annexation and western slavery expansion served him well among Northern Whigs and nearly secured him the election.<ref>Holt, 2005, p. 11-12</ref>\n\nThis was the last election in which Ohio voted for the Whigs and the last time that it voted against the Democrats until it voted Republican in 1856. It was also the only presidential election in which the winner, Polk, lost both his birth state of North Carolina and his state of residence, Tennessee, (which he lost by only 123 votes) prior to [[Donald Trump|Donald Trump's]] victory in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].

Scelba grew up in an observant [[Catholic]] family. At only 12 year old, he was forced to leave school and to help his family's finances. However, in 1914 Don Sturzo took steps to guarantee an education to Scelba, who began attending the first class of the lower gymnasium in Caltagirone. The outbreak of the [[World War I]] forced the institute to suspend lessons and Scelba recovered the lost years by studying as a privatist and achieving the classical diploma in 1920. He then studied law and graduated at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] in 1924, with a thesis on regional decentralization.<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/mario-scelba_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/ Mario Scelba \u2013 Dizionario Biografico], treccani.it</ref>\n\nDuring the university, he was selected by Sturzo as his private assistant and secretary. Since 1919, Sturzo was in fact the leader of the Christian democratic [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]] (PPI) and one of the most important politician in the country.<ref>[https://www.laciviltacattolica.it/articolo/luigi-sturzo-e-il-partito-popolare-italiano/ Luigi Sturzo e il Partito Popolare Italiano]</ref> When the fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] rose to power, suppressing all the other parties, including the PPI, Sturzo was forced into exile, while Scelba remained in Rome as his informer. During the regime, Scelba wrote for the newspaper ''Il Popolo'' (\"The People\"), but when it was banned in 1925, he founded a clandestine weekly newspaper known as ''L'idea popolare'' (\"People's Idea\").<ref>[https://issuu.com/istitutoluigisturzo/docs/04-2._luigi_sturzo_-_mario_scelba._ Luigi Sturzo \u2013 Mario Scelba : Carteggio (1923\u20131956)]</ref> In these years, Scelba started his career as a [[lawyer]] in the law firm of Filippo Del Giudice, and when the latter was forced to leave the country to save from fascist repression, Scelba inherited his customers.<ref>[https://digilander.libero.it/storiadimenticata/scelba.htm Mario Scelba \u2013 Siti personali], Libero</ref>\n\nIn 1929, he married Nerina Palestini, from [[San Benedetto del Tronto]], from whom he had a daughter Maria Luisa, born in 1930.<ref>[https://www.alinari.it/it/dettaglio/TEA-S-000741-0001 Mario Scelba con la moglie ad un ricevimento]</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\n[[File:Mario Scelba 1946.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Mario Scelba in 1946]]\nDuring the [[1930s]], he became a close friend of [[Alcide De Gasperi]], former leader of the People's Party after Sturzo's exile. Along with De Gasperi, he collaborated in the drafting of the ''Reconstructive ideas of the [[Christian democracy]]'', the first programmatic document of the future party, which was published in July 1943. Scelba was part of the committee which led the new party, known as [[Christian Democracy]] (DC), during the German occupation.

However, in 1914 Don Sturzo took steps to guarantee an education to Scelba, who began attending the first class of the lower gymnasium in Caltagirone. The outbreak of the [[World War I]] forced the institute to suspend lessons and Scelba recovered the lost years by studying as a privatist and achieving the classical diploma in 1920.

Examples include:\n* [[New South Wales]]: [[Robertson Land Acts|Crown Lands Acts]] (1861)\n* Canada: [[Dominion Lands Act]] (1872)\n* United States: [[Armed Occupation Act|Florida Armed Occupation Act]] (1842), [[Homestead Act]] (1862)\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Finders, keepers|Finders Keepers]]\n* [[Classical liberalism]]\n* [[Entitlement theory]]\n* [[Estate in land]]\n* [[Factors of production]]\n* [[Georgism]]\n* [[Labor theory of property]]\n* [[Land law|Land rights]]\n* [[Lockean proviso]]\n* [[Occupatio]]\n* [[Positive law]]\n* [[Possession as nine-tenths of the law]]\n* [[Seasteading]]\n* [[Squatting]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303448404577407800849985834 The Homestead Act- How the West Was Really Won]\n* [http://www.erosproject.com/ The Eros Project]\n\n{{property navbox}}\n[[Category:Legal doctrines and principles]]\n[[Category:Property law]]\n[[Category:Libertarian theory]]\n[[Category:Anarchist theory]]\n[[Category:Ethics]]\n", "name_user": "CastorCandiensis", "label": "safe", "comment": "The genealogical origins of of the concept of \"anarcho-capitalism\" as used by proponents of private, free-market political economy is dubious.
