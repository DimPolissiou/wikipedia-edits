Additionally, ''Emotions'' features influences from a range of genres such as [[gospel music|gospel]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]] and 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry infusion. On the record, Carey worked with a variety of producers and writers, including [[Walter Afanasieff]], the only hold over from her previous effort. Additionally, Carey wrote and produced the album's material with [[Robert Clivill\u00e9s]] and [[David Cole (producer)|David Cole]] from [[C+C Music Factory]] and [[Carole King]], with whom she wrote one song.\n\nUpon release, ''Emotions'' received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. The album debuted at number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], surprising many critics following the success of Carey's debut, which spent eleven weeks atop the chart. While selling far less than ''Mariah Carey'', ''Emotions'' was eventually certified quadruple-[[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting shipments of four million copies throughout the country, with estimated sales standing at 3,595,000 copies. ''Emotions'' achieved moderate success outside the United States, peaking within the top ten in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. Its success in Japan was strong, shipping one million copies there. The album has sold 8 million copies worldwide. <!--- Do not change the global sales figure without adding a reliable source --->\n\nThree commercial singles were released from the album. [[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|The title track]], the album's lead single, became Carey's fifth chart topper on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], making her the only artist in history to have their first five singles reach the chart's summit. Additionally, it became Carey's third chart topper in Canada, and reached the top ten in France, the Netherlands and New Zealand. \"[[Can't Let Go (Mariah Carey song)|Can't Let Go]]\" was released as the second single from ''Emotions'' on October 23, 1991. Due to Columbia's removal of the single from stores in an attempt to boost the album's sales, \"Can't Let Go\" failed to become her sixth chart topper in the US, peaking at number two. European and worldwide success was very limited, reaching the top 20 in only Canada and the UK. Similarly, \"[[Make It Happen (Mariah Carey song)|Make It Happen]]\" peaked at number five in the US, and achieved relatively weak international charting, prompting Columbia to halt promotion of the album.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the success of Carey's [[Mariah Carey (album)|self-titled]] debut album, critics wondered whether or not she would tour in order to promote the album in the major worldwide music markets.<ref name=\"Nickson\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=50}}</ref> However, Carey expressed in several interviews that due to the strenuous nature and the sheer difficulty of her songs, she feared a tour with back-to-back shows would not be possible, aside from the long travel times and constant travel.<ref name=\"Nickson\"/> With the extra time, Carey began writing and producing material for ''Emotions'' around the same time that her debut's third single, \"[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]],\" was released in December 1990. During this time period in music, it was traditional for an artist to release a [[studio album]] every two years in their prime, allowing the singles to fully promote the album through airwaves, as well as television appearances.<ref name=\"Nickson2\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=51}}</ref> Additionally, after a tour that would usually follow, as the next album would be released and would gain new fans, they would search the artist's catalog, and purchase the previous album in hopes of learning of their older work.<ref name=\"Nickson2\"/> [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]], however, chose to market Carey in a different fashion, leaning towards the traditional form in the 1960s, where acts would release an LP every year.<ref name=\"Nickson3\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=52}}</ref> They felt that Carey's reputation of being a \"studio worm\" and a songwriter from a young age would be captivating enough to deliver a new album more often than most.<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/>\n\nAs writing for the album came under way, Carey had a falling out with [[Ben Margulies]], the man whom Carey had written seven of the eleven songs on Carey's debut with.<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/> Together, the duo had written and produced seven songs for Carey's demo tape which she handed to [[Tommy Mottola]]. Their parting of ways was due to a contract Carey had signed prior to her signing with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]].<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/> Carey had agreed to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs, but half of her earnings as well, something she never thought twice about while writing songs in his father's basement.<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/> However, when the time came to write music for ''Emotions'', Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co-writers on an album.<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/> Following the discussion, Margulies filed a lawsuit against Sony, claiming that under contract, he would be entitled to work with Carey, as well as reap extra benefits. After an almost one year lawsuit, the judge settled that Margulies was to earn ten percent of Carey's direct earnings from her record sales, not including an income from any other ventures.<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/> While settled, their relationship remained ruined, damaged by what Carey considered treachery. In an interview with [[Fred Bronson]], Carey said the following regarding the contract: \"I signed blindly. Later, I tried to make it right so we could continue...but he wouldn't accept it.\"<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/> After the settlement, Margulies spoke of his feelings on the matter, claiming he would hope to one day write again with Carey, placing most of the blame on the record label and concluding \"Hopefully one day, art will prevail over business.\"<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/>\n\n== Recording ==\n''Mariah Carey'' had originally been recorded in Margulies' father's basement, with old and minimal equipment. After being signed to Columbia, the songs that would be used for the album were re-mastered and re-recorded in professional studios.<ref name=\"Nickson4\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=53}}</ref> However, due to Sony's involvement in the project, they did not allow Carey to produce most of the album, hoping the aid of several famed record producers would be able to ensure Carey's already deemed \"exquisite\" songs would become popular. After the album's success however, Carey was allowed more freedom on ''Emotions'' than on her debut.<ref name=\"Nickson4\"/> Since she no longer had a working or personal relationship with Margulies, she chose to work with mostly different musicians than those of her previous effort, with the exception of [[Walter Afanasieff]], the only hold over from ''Mariah Carey''.<ref name=\"Nickson4\"/> Even though he had only co-written \"[[Love Takes Time]],\" and had only produced part of the album, Carey felt a strong working chemistry with him, soon developing a unique form of songwriting alongside him. Aside from Afanasieff, Carey worked with [[Robert Clivill\u00e9s]] and [[David Cole (producer)|David Cole]] from the dance-music influenced production duo, [[C+C Music Factory]].<ref name=\"Nickson4\"/> Working with the duo was originally Mottola's suggestion, but after meeting the pair, Carey agreed and wrote four songs together with them.<ref name=\"Nickson4\"/>\n\nAdditionally, aside from the three men, Carey worked with [[Carole King]], a female [[singer-songwriter]] who had been predominantly popular in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Nickson5\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=54}}</ref> However, unlike with C+C Music Factory, King approached Carey, hoping to work with her after hearing her perform live on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]''. During a conversation with Carey, King suggested that she cover \"[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]],\" a song she had written with [[Gerry Goffin]] for [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name=\"Nickson5\"/> After giving it some thought, Carey declined the offer, feeling uncomfortable about recording a song she felt one of her musical influences performed so perfectly.<ref name=\"Nickson5\"/> Still determined on working with Carey, King flew to New York for one day, to try to create a ballad of some sort.<ref name=\"Nickson5\"/> The two ladies sat together by a piano over the course of the day, and by nightfall, had written and arranged a song titled \"[[If It's Over]].\"<ref name=\"Nickson6\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=55}}</ref> After working with Carey, King said in an interview \"I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings.\"<ref name=\"Nickson6\"/> After recording \"If It's Over,\" Carey expressed the musical connection she shared with Afanasieff, as well as the creative format in which she wrote and produced her music when with him, or working with C+C Music Factory.<ref name=\"Nickson7\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=56}}</ref> When working with Afanasieff, the duo would sit by a piano, and lead each other vocally and musically, until they would reach the right note and arrangement. During an interview in 1992, Afanasieff described how Carey would stand next to him, and begin singing different notes and tunes she was thinking of, while he would follow her with the piano.<ref name=\"Nickson7\"/> In doing so, he would help lead her to the right note and vice versa. Carey described their working relationship as \"very unique,\" and felt it to be very similar to the form in which she had worked with Margulies.<ref name=\"Nickson7\"/> While similar, Carey's creative process with Cole and Clivill\u00e9s proved different; they would bring her several different tapes and tunes, of which she would choose from. Afterwards, they would work on building the already created melody, and have Carey add and build onto it, as well as writing the lyrics and [[Key (music)|key]].<ref name=\"Nickson7\"/>\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n{{listen\n | filename     = Mariah Carey - Can't Let Go (1992).ogg\n | title        = \"Can't Let Go\"\n | description  = A sample from the song's chorus.

It borrowed from several genres ranging from gospel, [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]], pop and 1960s and 1970s influences.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The album's lead single \"[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]\" borrowed heavily from 1970s disco, and flaunted Carey's [[Vocal range|upper range]] and extensive use of the [[whistle register]].<ref name=\"Nickson8\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=60}}</ref> The song's lyrics were described as \"joyful\" by author Chris Nickson, and told of a strong and deep emotion felt by the protagonist when with their lover.<ref name=\"Nickson8\"/> One of the album's more gospel infused songs, \"And You Don't Remember,\" featured organ [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and held minimal production in order to give the [[Singing|vocals]] a more \"raw and sixties feel.\"<ref name=\"Nickson8\"/> It and the former song were part of a trio of tracks from the album that were meant to pay homage to [[Motown]] [[ballad]]s, with the inclusion of soft church [[choir]] vocals, and sole [[Arrangement|musical arrangement]] by Carey.<ref name=\"Nickson8\"/> Its [[lyrics]] reflected the song's raw chorus, telling of girl that is promised the world by her boyfriend, and quickly forget about her and moves to the next one. After the heartbreak, the protagonist asks him \"Don't You Remember\" all those things he had promised her, and the things they had spoken and dreamed about doing together.<ref name=\"Nickson8\"/> \"[[Can't Let Go (Mariah Carey song)|Can't Let Go]],\" the album's second single, is a slow ballad, featuring sad and yearning lyrical content.<ref name=\"Nickson9\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=61}}</ref> The song's introduction featured minor chord changes, and drew influence from [[1950s in music|fifties balladry]].<ref name=\"Nickson9\"/> For the duration of the first half of the song, Carey sings in her lower and huskier registers, eventually leading to the [[Belt (music)|belted]] crescendo and [[falsetto]] and whistle finish.<ref name=\"Nickson9\"/> Of the ten tracks on the album, Carey felt her most autobiographical lyrics were featured on \"[[Make It Happen (Mariah Carey song)|Make It Happen]],\" which told of Carey's poor and difficult teen life prior to being signed by Columbia.<ref name=\"Nickson9\"/> It continues telling of the importance of faith and prayer to God. Nickson described its instrumentation as \"restrained\" and \"very Motownish,\" as well as noting its soft gospel infusion.<ref name=\"Nickson9\"/> Critically, the most anticipated song on the album was \"[[If It's Over]],\" Carey's collaboration with King. It was influenced by sixties and seventies gospel and other soulful genres.<ref name=\"Nickson10\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=62}}</ref> According to Nickson, the song's instrumentation and basis was crucial to Carey's performance throughout the song. Additionally, he described its content and instrumentation:\n<blockquote>\nAs a song full of gospel and soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show what she could do \u2013 which in reality was far more than the vocal gymnastics that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals \u2013 which once again had those churchy harmonies \u2013 filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.<ref name=\"Nickson10\"/>\n</blockquote>\nThe next song on the album's track list, \"You're So Cold,\" was originally intended to be the lead single from ''Emotions'', eventually being switched for the title track. The song's introduction features a [[piano]] and [[a cappella|a capella]] vocal, working into its chorus.<ref name=\"Nickson10\"/> Chris Nickson wrote \"The song sailed into the chorus, driven by the house-y piano work, the bubbly, snacking rhythm belying the angry lyrics, the upbeat tone of voice.\"<ref name=\"Nickson10\"/> As Nickson hinted at, its lyrics featured an angry message, calling out an unfaithful lover and asking how he could be \"So Cold.\" \"So Blessed\" was a song Carey wrote with Afanasieff, infusing fifties style pop balladry into it. Carey's voice in the song is very restrained, as she stays within her lower registers throughout the duration of the track.<ref name=\"Nickson10\"/> \"To Be Around You\" was described by Nickson as \"far more [[staccato]].\" Its production and melody was intended to pay tribute to \"[[Got to Be Real]]\" by [[Cheryl Lynn]], as well as featuring spoken voices towards the end of the song.<ref name=\"Nickson10\"/> Nickson described \"Till the End of Time\" as a \"gentle, almost lullaby melody.\"<ref name=\"Nickson11\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=63}}</ref> It was a love ballad, preparing the listener for the song's final track, \"The Wind.\" The latter song featured the album's strongest [[jazz]] influence, and sampled a piano melody from [[Russ Freeman (pianist)|Russell Freeman]] during the 1950s.<ref name=\"Nickson11\"/> After Afanasieff presented Carey with the melody he had discovered, it inspired her to write the [[melody]] and lyrics, which told of a friend that perished in a drunk-driving accident.<ref name=\"Nickson11\"/> Musically, the album fulfilled its greatest challenge, according to critics. It had helped master Carey's usage and infusion of several genres which she had not tapped into during the recording of her debut.<ref name=\"Nickson11\"/>\n\n== Promotion ==\nAs with ''Mariah Carey'' the previous year, Carey did not embark on a tour to promote the album, due to the long travel times and strenuous schedules on her voice.<ref name=\"shapiro\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|p=60}}</ref> However, while not touring the world, Carey promoted ''Emotions'' through an array of television and award show appearances, stateside and across Europe.<ref name=\"shapiro\"/> Carey performed \"[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]\" live for the first time at the 1991 [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, backed by several male and female back up vocalists.<ref name=\"shapiro\"/> Following the award show appearance, she sang \"Emotions\" on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', airing on September 23, 1991. Additionally, Carey performed the song at the [[1992 Soul Train Music Awards]], and on British music program and talk show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[Des O'Connor]]''.<ref name=\"shapiro2\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|p=62}}</ref> Additional European stops included ''Sondagstoppet'' and ''Kulan'' in Sweden during mid-September 1991.

It was released on September 17, 1991 by [[Columbia Records]]. The album deviated from the formula of Carey's [[Mariah Carey (album)|1990 self-titled debut album]], as she had more creative control over the material she produced and recorded. Additionally, ''Emotions'' features influences from a range of genres such as [[gospel music|gospel]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]] and 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry infusion. On the record, Carey worked with a variety of producers and writers, including [[Walter Afanasieff]], the only hold over from her previous effort. Additionally, Carey wrote and produced the album's material with [[Robert Clivill\u00e9s]] and [[David Cole (producer)|David Cole]] from [[C+C Music Factory]] and [[Carole King]], with whom she wrote one song.\n\nUpon release, ''Emotions'' received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. The album debuted at number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], surprising many critics following the success of Carey's debut, which spent eleven weeks atop the chart. While selling far less than ''Mariah Carey'', ''Emotions'' was eventually certified quadruple-[[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting shipments of four million copies throughout the country, with estimated sales standing at 3,595,000 copies. ''Emotions'' achieved moderate success outside the United States, peaking within the top ten in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. Its success in Japan was strong, shipping one million copies there. The album has sold 8 million copies worldwide. <!--- Do not change the global sales figure without adding a reliable source --->\n\nThree commercial singles were released from the album. [[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|The title track]], the album's lead single, became Carey's fifth chart topper on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], making her the only artist in history to have their first five singles reach the chart's summit. Additionally, it became Carey's third chart topper in Canada, and reached the top ten in France, the Netherlands and New Zealand. \"[[Can't Let Go (Mariah Carey song)|Can't Let Go]]\" was released as the second single from ''Emotions'' on October 23, 1991. Due to Columbia's removal of the single from stores in an attempt to boost the album's sales, \"Can't Let Go\" failed to become her sixth chart topper in the US, peaking at number two. European and worldwide success was very limited, reaching the top 20 in only Canada and the UK. Similarly, \"[[Make It Happen (Mariah Carey song)|Make It Happen]]\" peaked at number five in the US, and achieved relatively weak international charting, prompting Columbia to halt promotion of the album.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the success of Carey's [[Mariah Carey (album)|self-titled]] debut album, critics wondered whether or not she would tour in order to promote the album in the major worldwide music markets.<ref name=\"Nickson\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=50}}</ref> However, Carey expressed in several interviews that due to the strenuous nature and the sheer difficulty of her songs, she feared a tour with back-to-back shows would not be possible, aside from the long travel times and constant travel.<ref name=\"Nickson\"/> With the extra time, Carey began writing and producing material for ''Emotions'' around the same time that her debut's third single, \"[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]],\" was released in December 1990. During this time period in music, it was traditional for an artist to release a [[studio album]] every two years in their prime, allowing the singles to fully promote the album through airwaves, as well as television appearances.<ref name=\"Nickson2\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=51}}</ref> Additionally, after a tour that would usually follow, as the next album would be released and would gain new fans, they would search the artist's catalog, and purchase the previous album in hopes of learning of their older work.<ref name=\"Nickson2\"/> [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]], however, chose to market Carey in a different fashion, leaning towards the traditional form in the 1960s, where acts would release an LP every year.<ref name=\"Nickson3\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=52}}</ref> They felt that Carey's reputation of being a \"studio worm\" and a songwriter from a young age would be captivating enough to deliver a new album more often than most.<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/>\n\nAs writing for the album came under way, Carey had a falling out with [[Ben Margulies]], the man whom Carey had written seven of the eleven songs on Carey's debut with.<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/> Together, the duo had written and produced seven songs for Carey's demo tape which she handed to [[Tommy Mottola]]. Their parting of ways was due to a contract Carey had signed prior to her signing with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]].<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/> Carey had agreed to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs, but half of her earnings as well, something she never thought twice about while writing songs in his father's basement.<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/> However, when the time came to write music for ''Emotions'', Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co-writers on an album.<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/> Following the discussion, Margulies filed a lawsuit against Sony, claiming that under contract, he would be entitled to work with Carey, as well as reap extra benefits. After an almost one year lawsuit, the judge settled that Margulies was to earn ten percent of Carey's direct earnings from her record sales, not including an income from any other ventures.<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/> While settled, their relationship remained ruined, damaged by what Carey considered treachery. In an interview with [[Fred Bronson]], Carey said the following regarding the contract: \"I signed blindly. Later, I tried to make it right so we could continue...but he wouldn't accept it.\"<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/> After the settlement, Margulies spoke of his feelings on the matter, claiming he would hope to one day write again with Carey, placing most of the blame on the record label and concluding \"Hopefully one day, art will prevail over business.\"<ref name=\"Nickson3\"/>\n\n== Recording ==\n''Mariah Carey'' had originally been recorded in Margulies' father's basement, with old and minimal equipment. After being signed to Columbia, the songs that would be used for the album were re-mastered and re-recorded in professional studios.<ref name=\"Nickson4\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=53}}</ref> However, due to Sony's involvement in the project, they did not allow Carey to produce most of the album, hoping the aid of several famed record producers would be able to ensure Carey's already deemed \"exquisite\" songs would become popular. After the album's success however, Carey was allowed more freedom on ''Emotions'' than on her debut.<ref name=\"Nickson4\"/> Since she no longer had a working or personal relationship with Margulies, she chose to work with mostly different musicians than those of her previous effort, with the exception of [[Walter Afanasieff]], the only hold over from ''Mariah Carey''.<ref name=\"Nickson4\"/> Even though he had only co-written \"[[Love Takes Time]],\" and had only produced part of the album, Carey felt a strong working chemistry with him, soon developing a unique form of songwriting alongside him. Aside from Afanasieff, Carey worked with [[Robert Clivill\u00e9s]] and [[David Cole (producer)|David Cole]] from the dance-music influenced production duo, [[C+C Music Factory]].<ref name=\"Nickson4\"/> Working with the duo was originally Mottola's suggestion, but after meeting the pair, Carey agreed and wrote four songs together with them.<ref name=\"Nickson4\"/>\n\nAdditionally, aside from the three men, Carey worked with [[Carole King]], a female [[singer-songwriter]] who had been predominantly popular in the 1970s.<ref name=\"Nickson5\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=54}}</ref> However, unlike with C+C Music Factory, King approached Carey, hoping to work with her after hearing her perform live on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]''. During a conversation with Carey, King suggested that she cover \"[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]],\" a song she had written with [[Gerry Goffin]] for [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name=\"Nickson5\"/> After giving it some thought, Carey declined the offer, feeling uncomfortable about recording a song she felt one of her musical influences performed so perfectly.<ref name=\"Nickson5\"/> Still determined on working with Carey, King flew to New York for one day, to try to create a ballad of some sort.<ref name=\"Nickson5\"/> The two ladies sat together by a piano over the course of the day, and by nightfall, had written and arranged a song titled \"[[If It's Over]].\"<ref name=\"Nickson6\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=55}}</ref> After working with Carey, King said in an interview \"I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings.\"<ref name=\"Nickson6\"/> After recording \"If It's Over,\" Carey expressed the musical connection she shared with Afanasieff, as well as the creative format in which she wrote and produced her music when with him, or working with C+C Music Factory.<ref name=\"Nickson7\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=56}}</ref> When working with Afanasieff, the duo would sit by a piano, and lead each other vocally and musically, until they would reach the right note and arrangement. During an interview in 1992, Afanasieff described how Carey would stand next to him, and begin singing different notes and tunes she was thinking of, while he would follow her with the piano.<ref name=\"Nickson7\"/> In doing so, he would help lead her to the right note and vice versa. Carey described their working relationship as \"very unique,\" and felt it to be very similar to the form in which she had worked with Margulies.<ref name=\"Nickson7\"/> While similar, Carey's creative process with Cole and Clivill\u00e9s proved different; they would bring her several different tapes and tunes, of which she would choose from. Afterwards, they would work on building the already created melody, and have Carey add and build onto it, as well as writing the lyrics and [[Key (music)|key]].<ref name=\"Nickson7\"/>\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n{{listen\n | filename     = Mariah Carey - Can't Let Go (1992).ogg\n | title        = \"Can't Let Go\"\n | description  = A sample from the song's chorus.

It borrowed from several genres ranging from gospel, [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]], pop and 1960s and 1970s influences.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The album's lead single \"[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]\" borrowed heavily from 1970s disco, and flaunted Carey's [[Vocal range|upper range]] and extensive use of the [[whistle register]].<ref name=\"Nickson8\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=60}}</ref> The song's lyrics were described as \"joyful\" by author Chris Nickson, and told of a strong and deep emotion felt by the protagonist when with their lover.<ref name=\"Nickson8\"/> One of the album's more gospel infused songs, \"And You Don't Remember,\" featured organ [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and held minimal production in order to give the [[Singing|vocals]] a more \"raw and sixties feel.\"<ref name=\"Nickson8\"/> It and the former song were part of a trio of tracks from the album that were meant to pay homage to [[Motown]] [[ballad]]s, with the inclusion of soft church [[choir]] vocals, and sole [[Arrangement|musical arrangement]] by Carey.<ref name=\"Nickson8\"/> Its [[lyrics]] reflected the song's raw chorus, telling of girl that is promised the world by her boyfriend, and quickly forget about her and moves to the next one. After the heartbreak, the protagonist asks him \"Don't You Remember\" all those things he had promised her, and the things they had spoken and dreamed about doing together.<ref name=\"Nickson8\"/> \"[[Can't Let Go (Mariah Carey song)|Can't Let Go]],\" the album's second single, is a slow ballad, featuring sad and yearning lyrical content.<ref name=\"Nickson9\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=61}}</ref> The song's introduction featured minor chord changes, and drew influence from [[1950s in music|fifties balladry]].<ref name=\"Nickson9\"/> For the duration of the first half of the song, Carey sings in her lower and huskier registers, eventually leading to the [[Belt (music)|belted]] crescendo and [[falsetto]] and whistle finish.<ref name=\"Nickson9\"/> Of the ten tracks on the album, Carey felt her most autobiographical lyrics were featured on \"[[Make It Happen (Mariah Carey song)|Make It Happen]],\" which told of Carey's poor and difficult teen life prior to being signed by Columbia.<ref name=\"Nickson9\"/> It continues telling of the importance of faith and prayer to God. Nickson described its instrumentation as \"restrained\" and \"very Motownish,\" as well as noting its soft gospel infusion.<ref name=\"Nickson9\"/> Critically, the most anticipated song on the album was \"[[If It's Over]],\" Carey's collaboration with King. It was influenced by sixties and seventies gospel and other soulful genres.<ref name=\"Nickson10\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=62}}</ref> According to Nickson, the song's instrumentation and basis was crucial to Carey's performance throughout the song. Additionally, he described its content and instrumentation:\n<blockquote>\nAs a song full of gospel and soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show what she could do \u2013 which in reality was far more than the vocal gymnastics that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals \u2013 which once again had those churchy harmonies \u2013 filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.<ref name=\"Nickson10\"/>\n</blockquote>\nThe next song on the album's track list, \"You're So Cold,\" was originally intended to be the lead single from ''Emotions'', eventually being switched for the title track. The song's introduction features a [[piano]] and [[a cappella|a capella]] vocal, working into its chorus.<ref name=\"Nickson10\"/> Chris Nickson wrote \"The song sailed into the chorus, driven by the house-y piano work, the bubbly, snacking rhythm belying the angry lyrics, the upbeat tone of voice.\"<ref name=\"Nickson10\"/> As Nickson hinted at, its lyrics featured an angry message, calling out an unfaithful lover and asking how he could be \"So Cold.\" \"So Blessed\" was a song Carey wrote with Afanasieff, infusing fifties style pop balladry into it. Carey's voice in the song is very restrained, as she stays within her lower registers throughout the duration of the track.<ref name=\"Nickson10\"/> \"To Be Around You\" was described by Nickson as \"far more [[staccato]].\" Its production and melody was intended to pay tribute to \"[[Got to Be Real]]\" by [[Cheryl Lynn]], as well as featuring spoken voices towards the end of the song.<ref name=\"Nickson10\"/> Nickson described \"Till the End of Time\" as a \"gentle, almost lullaby melody.\"<ref name=\"Nickson11\">{{harvnb|Nickson|2001|p=63}}</ref> It was a love ballad, preparing the listener for the song's final track, \"The Wind.\" The latter song featured the album's strongest [[jazz]] influence, and sampled a piano melody from [[Russ Freeman (pianist)|Russell Freeman]] during the 1950s.<ref name=\"Nickson11\"/> After Afanasieff presented Carey with the melody he had discovered, it inspired her to write the [[melody]] and lyrics, which told of a friend that perished in a drunk-driving accident.<ref name=\"Nickson11\"/> Musically, the album fulfilled its greatest challenge, according to critics. It had helped master Carey's usage and infusion of several genres which she had not tapped into during the recording of her debut.<ref name=\"Nickson11\"/>\n\n== Promotion ==\nAs with ''Mariah Carey'' the previous year, Carey did not embark on a tour to promote the album, due to the long travel times and strenuous schedules on her voice.<ref name=\"shapiro\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|p=60}}</ref> However, while not touring the world, Carey promoted ''Emotions'' through an array of television and award show appearances, stateside and across Europe.<ref name=\"shapiro\"/> Carey performed \"[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]\" live for the first time at the 1991 [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, backed by several male and female back up vocalists.<ref name=\"shapiro\"/> Following the award show appearance, she sang \"Emotions\" on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', airing on September 23, 1991. Additionally, Carey performed the song at the [[1992 Soul Train Music Awards]], and on British music program and talk show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[Des O'Connor]]''.<ref name=\"shapiro2\">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|p=62}}</ref> Additional European stops included ''Sondagstoppet'' and ''Kulan'' in Sweden during mid-September 1991. All of the above-mentioned performances included \"[[Can't Let Go (Mariah Carey song)|Can't Let Go]]\" as a secondary performance in the night.<ref name=\"shapiro2\"/> \"Can't Let Go\" was sung on additional programs such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', a pre-filmed studio clip on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]''. While the album's final single \"[[Make It Happen (Mariah Carey song)|Make It Happen]]\" was released only months after ''Emotions'' release, the song was not performed during the album's original chart run, however making its way onto the set-list of several of Carey following tours.<ref name=\"shapiro2\"/> On February 26, 1992, Carey performed \"[[If It's Over]]\" at the [[34th Grammy Awards|34th annual]] [[Grammy Award]], with a full orchestra and several back up singers.<ref name=\"shapiro\"/>\n\n=== Singles ===\n{{listen\n | filename     = Mariah Carry - Emotions.ogg\n | title        = \"Emotions\"\n | description  = A sample from the song's final chorus, featuring Carey's usage of the whistle register.\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\nThree commercial singles were released from ''Emotions''.
