The movie is set in [[Unna]], [[Westphalia]], which was, besides [[Dortmund]], one of the shooting locations.\n\n==Plot==\nThe part-time criminal Keek has lost most of the money from a bank robbery that he committed together with the now jailed Karl-Heinz \"Kalle\" Grabowski.\n\nWhen Kalle watches a porn-movie in jail, shot by Keek's friend Franky, he sees his wife Manuela starring in the movie, Kalle goes crazy and escapes from prison. Before killing Franky, the escaped Kalle unexpectedly appears at Keek's door and demands his money.\n\nThe next day, the alcoholic \"Schlucke\" is forced by his boss Werner Kampmann, to break into his transport company to pretend a burglary because of insurance fraud. Schlucke, however, has talked boastfully about his plan, so that Keek sees a chance to get the money for Kalle. Together with his friend Andy, Schlucke and Ratte (another fellow criminal) break into the company.

Retrieved 18 April 2014</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nMessiaen wrote in the Preface to the score that the work was inspired by text from the [[Book of Revelation]] (Rev 10:1\u20132, 5\u20137, [[King James Version]]):\n<blockquote>And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire ... and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth .... And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever ... that there should be time no longer: But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished ...</blockquote>\n\n==Structure==\nThe work is in eight [[Movement (music)|movements]]:\n\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman\n|\"Liturgie de cristal\" (Crystal [[liturgy]])\n|\"Vocalise, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\" ([[Vocalise]], for the Angel who announces the end of time)\n|\"Ab\u00eeme des oiseaux\" (Abyss of birds)\n|\"Interm\u00e8de\" ([[Intermezzo|Interlude]])\n|\"Louange \u00e0 l'\u00c9ternit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\" (Praise to the eternity of Jesus)\n|\"Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes\" (Dance of fury, for the seven trumpets)\n|\"Fouillis d'arcs-en-ciel, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\" (Tangle of rainbows, for the Angel who announces the end of time)\n|\"Louange \u00e0 l'Immortalit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\" (Praise to the immortality of Jesus)\n}}\nBelow, quotations are translated from Messiaen's Preface to the score.\n\n===I. \"Liturgie de cristal\"===\nIn his preface to the score, Messiaen describes the opening of the quartet:\n\n{{quote|Between three and four in the morning, the awakening of birds: a solo blackbird or nightingale improvises, surrounded by a shimmer of sound, by a halo of trills lost very high in the trees. Transpose this onto a religious plane and you have the harmonious silence of Heaven.}}\nWritten for the full for the full quartet, the opening movement begins with the solo clarinet imitating a blackbird's song and the violin imitating a nightingale\u2019s song. The underlying pulse is provided by the cello and piano: the cello cycles through the same five-note melody (using the pitches C, E, D, F-sharp, and B-flat) and a repeating pattern of 15 durations. The piano part consists of a 17-note rhythmic pattern permuted strictly through 29 chords, as if to give the listener a glimpse of something eternal.\n\n===II. \"Vocalise, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\"===\nAlso for the full quartet, Messiaen writes of this movement:\n\n{{quote|The first and third parts (very short) evoke the power of this mighty angel, a rainbow upon his head and clothed with a cloud, who sets one foot on the sea and one foot on the earth. In the middle section are the impalpable harmonies of heaven. In the piano, sweet cascades of blue-orange chords, enclosing in their distant chimes the almost plainchant song of the violin and cello.}}\n\n===III. \"Ab\u00eeme des oiseaux\"===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|The abyss is Time with its sadness, its weariness. The birds are the opposite to Time; they are our desire for light, for stars, for rainbows, and for jubilant songs.}}\nA solo for the clarinet, this movement is a test for even the most accomplished clarinetist, with an extremely slow tempo marking {{nowrap|1=[[quaver]] (eighth note) = [[Tempo#Measuring Tempo|44]]}}.\n\n===IV. \"Interm\u00e8de\"===\nA trio for violin, cello, and clarinet, Messiaen writes of this movement:\n\n{{quote|Scherzo, of a more individual character than the other movements, but linked to them nevertheless by certain [[melodic]] recollections.}}\n\n===V. \"Louange \u00e0 l'\u00c9ternit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\"===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|Jesus is considered here as the Word. A broad phrase, \"infinitely slow\", on the cello, magnifies with love and reverence the eternity of the Word, powerful and gentle, \"whose time never runs out\". The melody stretches majestically into a kind of gentle, regal distance.  \"In the beginning was the Word, and Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" ([[Gospel of John|John]] 1:1 (King James Version))}}\nA duet for cello and piano, the music is arranged from an earlier composition, \"IV. L'Eau\" from \"[[F\u00eate des belles eaux]]\" for 6 [[Ondes Martenot]]s, performed at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition]] of 1937.  The tempo marking is ''infiniment lent, extatique'' (\"infinitely slow, ecstatic\").\n\n===VI. \"Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes\"===\n[[Image:Messiaen Quatuor Danse de fureur excerpt.jpg|thumb|right|450px|An excerpt from Movement VI (\"Danse de la fureur ...\"), which is played by all four instruments in [[unison]]. It shows Messiaen's use of additive rhythms, in which the underlying quaver beat (eighth notes) is sometimes [[augmentation (music)|augmented]] by a semiquaver (sixteenth note).]]\nMessiaen writes of this movement, which is for full quartet:\n\n{{quote|Rhythmically, the most characteristic piece of the series. The four instruments in unison imitate gongs and trumpets (the first six trumpets of the Apocalypse followed by various disasters, the trumpet of the seventh angel announcing consummation of the mystery of God) Use of added values, of augmented or diminished rhythms, of non-retrogradable rhythms. Music of stone, formidable granite sound; irresistible movement of steel, huge blocks of purple rage, icy drunkenness.  Hear especially all the terrible ''fortissimo'' of the augmentation of the theme and changes of register of its different notes, towards the end of the piece.}}\nToward the end of the movement the theme returns, ''fortissimo'', in augmentation and with wide changes of register.\n\n===VII. \"Fouillis d'arcs-en-ciel, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\"===\nMessiaen writes of this quartet movement:\n\n{{quote|Recurring here are certain passages from the second movement. The angel appears in full force, especially the rainbow that covers him (the rainbow, symbol of peace, wisdom, and all luminescent and sonorous vibration). \u2013 In my dreams, I hear and see ordered chords and melodies, known colors and shapes; then, after this transitional stage, I pass through the unreal and suffer, with ecstasy, a tournament; a roundabout compenetration of superhuman sounds and colors. These swords of fire, this blue-orange lava, these sudden stars: there is the tangle, there are the rainbows!}}\n===VIII. \"Louange \u00e0 l'Immortalit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\"===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|Large violin solo, counterpart to the violoncello solo of the 5th movement. Why this second eulogy? It is especially aimed at the second aspect of Jesus, Jesus the Man, the Word made flesh, immortally risen for our communication of his life. It is all love. Its slow ascent to the acutely extreme is the ascent of man to his god, the child of God to his Father, the being made divine towards Paradise.}}\nA duet for violin and piano, the music is an arrangement of the second part of his earlier [[Organ (music)|organ]] piece \"Diptyque\", transposed up a major third from C to E.\n\n==Derivative works==\nThe piece is the inspiration for ''[[Quartet for the End of Time (novel)|Quartet for the End of Time]]'', a 2014 novel by [[Johanna Skibsrud]] that borrows its title and structure from the piece.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Olivier Messiaen, ''Quatuor pour la fin du temps'' (score) (Paris: Durand)\n* Anthony Pople, ''Messiaen:  Quatuor pour la fin du temps'', Cambridge Music Handbooks (Cambridge University Press, 2003)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/messiaen/music/quatuor.html Nigel Simeone on Quatuor pour la fin du temps]\n* [http://www.entretemps.asso.fr/Nicolas/Textes/Messiaen.htm \"Sur le ''Quatuor pour la fin du temps''\"] \u2013 extensive analysis by Fran\u00e7ois Nicolas (in French).\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216122341/http://www.oliviermessiaen.net/ Boston University Messiaen Project: performances, studies and information]\n* [http://www2.lawrence.edu/dept/it/musicguides/mq/ \"Quatuor pour la fin du temps\"] \u2013 Musical and Biblical Analysis from Lawrence University Freshman Studies curriculum\n* [http://issuu.com/cmac13/docs/music_for_the_end_of_time \"Music for the End of Time\"] \u2013 an appreciation by Michael R.

In the piano, sweet cascades of blue-orange chords, enclosing in their distant chimes the almost plainchant song of the violin and cello.}}\n\n===III. \"Ab\u00eeme des oiseaux\"===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|The abyss is Time with its sadness, its weariness. The birds are the opposite to Time; they are our desire for light, for stars, for rainbows, and for jubilant songs.}}\nA solo for the clarinet, this movement is a test for even the most accomplished clarinetist, with an extremely slow tempo marking {{nowrap|1=[[quaver]] (eighth note) = [[Tempo#Measuring Tempo|44]]}}.\n\n===IV. \"Interm\u00e8de\"===\nA trio for for violin, cello, and clarinet, Messiaen writes of this movement:\n\n{{quote|Scherzo, of a more individual character than the other movements, but linked to them nevertheless by certain [[melodic]] recollections.}}\n\n===V. \"Louange \u00e0 l'\u00c9ternit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\"===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|Jesus is considered here as the Word. A broad phrase, \"infinitely slow\", on the cello, magnifies with love and reverence the eternity of the Word, powerful and gentle, \"whose time never runs out\". The melody stretches majestically into a kind of gentle, regal distance.  \"In the beginning was the Word, and Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" ([[Gospel of John|John]] 1:1 (King James Version))}}\nA duet for cello and piano, the music is arranged from an earlier composition, \"IV. L'Eau\" from \"[[F\u00eate des belles eaux]]\" for 6 [[Ondes Martenot]]s, performed at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition]] of 1937.  The tempo marking is ''infiniment lent, extatique'' (\"infinitely slow, ecstatic\").\n\n===VI. \"Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes\"===\n[[Image:Messiaen Quatuor Danse de fureur excerpt.jpg|thumb|right|450px|An excerpt from Movement VI (\"Danse de la fureur ...\"), which is played by all four instruments in [[unison]]. It shows Messiaen's use of additive rhythms, in which the underlying quaver beat (eighth notes) is sometimes [[augmentation (music)|augmented]] by a semiquaver (sixteenth note).]]\nMessiaen writes of this movement, which is for full quartet:\n\n{{quote|Rhythmically, the most characteristic piece of the series. The four instruments in unison imitate gongs and trumpets (the first six trumpets of the Apocalypse followed by various disasters, the trumpet of the seventh angel announcing consummation of the mystery of God) Use of added values, of augmented or diminished rhythms, of non-retrogradable rhythms. Music of stone, formidable granite sound; irresistible movement of steel, huge blocks of purple rage, icy drunkenness.  Hear especially all the terrible ''fortissimo'' of the augmentation of the theme and changes of register of its different notes, towards the end of the piece.}}\nToward the end of the movement the theme returns, ''fortissimo'', in augmentation and with wide changes of register.\n\n===VII. \"Fouillis d'arcs-en-ciel, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\"===\nMessiaen writes of this quartet movement:\n\n{{quote|Recurring here are certain passages from the second movement. The angel appears in full force, especially the rainbow that covers him (the rainbow, symbol of peace, wisdom, and all luminescent and sonorous vibration). \u2013 In my dreams, I hear and see ordered chords and melodies, known colors and shapes; then, after this transitional stage, I pass through the unreal and suffer, with ecstasy, a tournament; a roundabout compenetration of superhuman sounds and colors. These swords of fire, this blue-orange lava, these sudden stars: there is the tangle, there are the rainbows!}}\n===VIII. \"Louange \u00e0 l'Immortalit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\"===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|Large violin solo, counterpart to the violoncello solo of the 5th movement. Why this second eulogy? It is especially aimed at the second aspect of Jesus, Jesus the Man, the Word made flesh, immortally risen for our communication of his life. It is all love. Its slow ascent to the acutely extreme is the ascent of man to his god, the child of God to his Father, the being made divine towards Paradise.}}\nA duet for violin and piano, the music is an arrangement of the second part of his earlier [[Organ (music)|organ]] piece \"Diptyque\", transposed up a major third from C to E.\n\n==Derivative works==\nThe piece is the inspiration for ''[[Quartet for the End of Time (novel)|Quartet for the End of Time]]'', a 2014 novel by [[Johanna Skibsrud]] that borrows its title and structure from the piece.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Olivier Messiaen, ''Quatuor pour la fin du temps'' (score) (Paris: Durand)\n* Anthony Pople, ''Messiaen:  Quatuor pour la fin du temps'', Cambridge Music Handbooks (Cambridge University Press, 2003)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/messiaen/music/quatuor.html Nigel Simeone on Quatuor pour la fin du temps]\n* [http://www.entretemps.asso.fr/Nicolas/Textes/Messiaen.htm \"Sur le ''Quatuor pour la fin du temps''\"] \u2013 extensive analysis by Fran\u00e7ois Nicolas (in French).\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216122341/http://www.oliviermessiaen.net/ Boston University Messiaen Project: performances, studies and information]\n* [http://www2.lawrence.edu/dept/it/musicguides/mq/ \"Quatuor pour la fin du temps\"] \u2013 Musical and Biblical Analysis from Lawrence University Freshman Studies curriculum\n* [http://issuu.com/cmac13/docs/music_for_the_end_of_time \"Music for the End of Time\"] \u2013 an appreciation by Michael R.

Caroline remarried one year later to Clyde H. Ray Jr., an antique dealer and florist.

It was described as \"so remote that visitors had to drive through a cow pasture taking care to close a maze of gates behind them\".<ref name=\"Women\" /> In the decades that followed, Miller continued to write, completing several manuscripts.

The obligations and attention imposed upon Caroline were incompatible with the quiet, simple, existence that she and William had enjoyed prior to her fame. In 1936, the couple divorced. Caroline remarried one year later to Clyde H. Ray Jr., an antique dealer and florist. The couple moved to [[Waynesville, North Carolina]], where Caroline helped out in the family business while continuing to write short stories and articles for newspapers and magazines, such as [[Pictorial Review]] and [[Ladies Home Journal]].<ref name=\"NGE\" /><ref name=\"FloraVogel1980\" /> They had one daughter and a son.<ref name=\"Fame\" />\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1944, Miller finished her second novel, ''Lebanon'', which garnered mixed reviews from the critics. Although constructed along the lines of her earlier work, set in rural Georgia, the new novel had a romantic storyline which was criticized as being awkward and unrealistic.<ref name=\"NGE\" />\n\nAfter her second husband died, Miller moved to a remote mountain home. It was described as \"so remote that visitors had to drive through a cow pasture taking care to close a maze of gates behind them\".<ref name=\"Women\" /> In the decades that followed, Miller continued to write, completing several manuscripts. But she never sought to publish them. For the most part, she lived a quiet, private, life in her mountain home in western North Carolina.<ref name=\"NGE\" /><ref name=\"Women\" />\n\n==Death and legacy==  \n[[File:Caroline Pafford Miller historical marker.jpg|thumb|Historical marker in Baxley, Appling County, Georgia]]\nMiller died on July 12, 1992, in [[Waynesville, North Carolina]], at the age of 88.

It also appeared inside the German Top 10 gaining gold status. The song \"[[Oh Yeah (Yello song)|Oh Yeah]]\" from the album gained the band worldwide attention the following year, after it prominently appeared in the 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' and then a year later in ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]''. The song was released shortly after and became the band's only single to chart in the US, reaching No. 51.\n\nIn 1988, single \"[[The Race (Yello song)|The Race]]\" from the album ''[[Flag (Yello album)|Flag]]'' reached No. 7 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as their only Top 10 hit there.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It in the film ''[[Nuns on the Run]]''.\n\nIn 1995, a tribute remix album ''[[Hands on Yello]]'' was released featuring remixes by [[Moby]], [[The Orb]], [[Carl Craig]], [[Carl Cox]], [[The Grid]] and [[WestBam]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nIn 2005, Yello re-released their early albums ''[[Solid Pleasure]]'', ''[[Claro Que Si]]'', ''[[You Gotta Say Yes to Another Excess]]'', ''[[Stella (album)|Stella]]'', ''[[One Second (Yello album)|One Second]]'' and ''[[Flag (Yello album)|Flag]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> all with rare bonus tracks, as part of the Yello Remaster Series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Yello-Remaster-Series/release/573648 |title=Yello - Remaster Series (Box Set, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=August 16, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA documentary on Yello, ''Electro Pop Made in Switzerland'', directed by [[Anka Schmid]], was premiered at the Riff Raff cinema in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in September 2005.<ref name=\"Thread on Yello site forum about the Zurich premiere of 'Electro Pop made in Switzerland' documentary\">[http://forum.theyellosite.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=226 ]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>\n\nYello was commissioned to produce music for the launch of the [[Audi A5]] at the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in March 2007 and for the Audi A5 commercial in May 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.audiusanews.com/newsrelease.do?id=531&mid=67 |title=Audi A5 In Verona - A Road Movie Becomes Reality |publisher=Audiusanews.com |accessdate=April 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214201021/http://www.audiusanews.com/newsrelease.do?id=531&mid=67 |archive-date=February 14, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Musical style==\n{{Listen||pos = left|filename=Yello - Oh Yeah excerpt.ogg|title=Yello - Oh Yeah excerpt|description=An excerpt from \"Oh Yeah\"}}\nYello's sound is mainly characterised by unusual music samples, a heavy reliance on rhythm and [[Dieter Meier]]'s dark voice. Yello makes heavy use of sampling in the construction of rhythm tracks, such as in ''The Race'' from 1988.\n\nBoris Blank has taken a couple of vocal turns; on \"Swing\" (from ''You Gotta Say Yes to Another Excess'') and \"Blazing Saddles\" (from ''Flag''). Guest vocalists have included Rush Winters, [[Billy MacKenzie]], [[Stina Nordenstam]], [[Jade Davies]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Heidi Happy]] and [[FiFi Rong]]. The group has shared writing credit with MacKenzie, Winters and Happy.\n\nYello rarely uses samples from previously released music; nearly every instrument has been sampled and re-engineered by Boris Blank, who over the years has built up an original sample library of over 100,000 named and categorised sounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1994_articles/dec94/yello.html |title=Boris Blank (Yello): Recording Zebra |publisher=Soundonsound.com |accessdate=April 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410120500/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1994_articles/dec94/yello.html |archivedate=April 10, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Dieter Meier]] (vocals, lyrics), a millionaire industrialist and gambler, was brought in when the two founders realised that they needed a singer.

The LP ''[[Solid Pleasure]]'', featuring the original short version of \"[[Bostich (song)|Bostich]]\" (extended to a hit dance single in 1981), was released in November 1980.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In early 1983, just after release of \"You Gotta Say Yes to Another Excess\", Per\u00f3n left Yello in order to pursue a solo career.\n\nThe band's fourth studio album ''[[Stella (album)|Stella]]'' went No. 1 in Switzerland in 1985 as the first album ever by a Swiss group to top the Swiss album chart. It also appeared inside the German Top 10 gaining gold status. The song \"[[Oh Yeah (Yello song)|Oh Yeah]]\" from the album gained the band worldwide attention the following year, after it prominently appeared in the 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' and then a year later in ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]''. The song was released shortly after and became the band's only single to chart in the US, reaching No. 51.\n\nIn 1988, single \"[[The Race (Yello song)|The Race]]\" from the album ''[[Flag (Yello album)|Flag]]'' reached No. 7 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as their only Top 10 hit there.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It in the film ''[[Nuns on the Run]]''.\n\nIn 1995, a tribute remix album ''[[Hands on Yello]]'' was released featuring remixes by [[Moby]], [[The Orb]], [[Carl Craig]], [[Carl Cox]], [[The Grid]] and [[WestBam]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nIn 2005, Yello re-released their early albums ''[[Solid Pleasure]]'', ''[[Claro Que Si]]'', ''[[You Gotta Say Yes to Another Excess]]'', ''[[Stella (album)|Stella]]'', ''[[One Second (Yello album)|One Second]]'' and ''[[Flag (Yello album)|Flag]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> all with rare bonus tracks, as part of the Yello Remaster Series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Yello-Remaster-Series/release/573648 |title=Yello - Remaster Series (Box Set, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=August 16, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA documentary on Yello, ''Electro Pop Made in Switzerland'', directed by [[Anka Schmid]], was premiered at the Riff Raff cinema in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in September 2005.<ref name=\"Thread on Yello site forum about the Zurich premiere of 'Electro Pop made in Switzerland' documentary\">[http://forum.theyellosite.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=226 ]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>\n\nYello was commissioned to produce music for the launch of the [[Audi A5]] at the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in March 2007 and for the Audi A5 commercial in May 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.audiusanews.com/newsrelease.do?id=531&mid=67 |title=Audi A5 In Verona - A Road Movie Becomes Reality |publisher=Audiusanews.com |accessdate=April 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214201021/http://www.audiusanews.com/newsrelease.do?id=531&mid=67 |archive-date=February 14, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Musical style==\n{{Listen||pos = left|filename=Yello - Oh Yeah excerpt.ogg|title=Yello - Oh Yeah excerpt|description=An excerpt from \"Oh Yeah\"}}\nYello's sound is mainly characterised by unusual music samples, a heavy reliance on rhythm and [[Dieter Meier]]'s dark voice. Yello makes heavy use of sampling in the construction of rhythm tracks, such as in ''The Race'' from 1988.\n\nBoris Blank has taken a couple of vocal turns; on \"Swing\" (from ''You Gotta Say Yes to Another Excess'') and \"Blazing Saddles\" (from ''Flag''). Guest vocalists have included Rush Winters, [[Billy MacKenzie]], [[Stina Nordenstam]], [[Jade Davies]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Heidi Happy]] and [[FiFi Rong]]. The group has shared writing credit with MacKenzie, Winters and Happy.\n\nYello rarely uses samples from previously released music; nearly every instrument has been sampled and re-engineered by Boris Blank, who over the years has built up an original sample library of over 100,000 named and categorised sounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1994_articles/dec94/yello.html |title=Boris Blank (Yello): Recording Zebra |publisher=Soundonsound.com |accessdate=April 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410120500/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1994_articles/dec94/yello.html |archivedate=April 10, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

After postdoctoral positions at the [[University of Chicago]], [[Argonne National Lab]] and the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]], he joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins in 2002.\n\nHis primary research interest is physics [[beyond the standard model]], with a particular focus on the [[Higgs mechanism]] and potentially related physics such as [[supersymmetry]], new  [[forces]], [[extra dimensions]], and [[dark matter]]. He is also exploring connections between [[high energy physics]] and [[cosmology]].

He was accused by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and others of denying the need for divine aid in performing [[good works]]. They understood him to have said that the only grace necessary was the declaration of the law; humans were not wounded by Adam's sin and were perfectly able to fulfill the law without divine aid. Pelagius denied Augustine's theory of [[original sin]]. Adherents of Pelagius cited [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 24:16 in support of their position. Pelagius was declared a [[heresy|heretic]] by the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. His interpretation of a doctrine of free will became known as [[Pelagianism]].\n\nHe was well educated, fluent in both [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and learned in [[theology]]. He spent time as an ascetic, focusing on practical asceticism. He was well known in Rome, both for the harsh asceticism of his public life and the power and persuasiveness of his speech. His reputation earned him praise early in his career even from such pillars of the Church as Augustine, who referred to him as a \"saintly man.\" However, he was later accused of lying about his own teachings to avoid public condemnation. Most of his later life was spent defending his doctrine against Christian theologians who held that Pelagius was spreading novelties in the Faith unknown to the apostolic tradition.\n\nDue to some calling him a heretic, little of his work has come down to the present day except in the quotes of his opponents. However, more recently, some authors have defended Pelagius as a misunderstood \u201corthodox\u201d:\n{{quote|Recent analysis of his thinking suggests that it was, in fact, highly orthodox, following in the tradition established by the early fathers and in keeping with the teaching of the church in both the East and the West. ...From what we are able to piece together from the few sources available ... it seems that the [[Celts|Celtic]] monk held to an orthodox view of the prevenience of God's grace, and did not assert that individuals could achieve salvation purely by their own efforts.<ref>Bradley, Ian (1993) ''The Celtic Way''.

He began to teach a very strict, rigid moralism, emphasizing a natural, innate human ability to attain salvation.<ref name=\"Filippo\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2008/sfilippo_augustinepelag_jan08.asp|title=St. Augustine and Pelagianism {{!}} Stephen N.

Augustine wrote \"''De peccatorum meritis et remissione'' libri III\" (Three Books on the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins) in 412, and \"''De spiritu et littera''\" (On the Spirit and the Letter) in 414. When in 414 disquieting rumours arrived from Sicily and the so-called \"Definitiones Caelestii\", said to be the work of Caelestius, were sent to him, he at once (414 or 415) published the rejoinder, \"De perfectione justitiae hominis.\" In these, he strongly affirmed the existence of original sin, the need for infant baptism, the impossibility of a sinless life without Christ, and the necessity of Christ's grace. Augustine stands as an important source on the life and theology of Pelagius, and wrote about him extensively.<ref name=pohle/>\n\n=== Jerome ===\nPelagius soon left for Palestine, befriending the bishop there. Jerome, who also lived there, became involved, as well.  Pelagius had criticized his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians.<ref name=pohle/> Jerome wrote against Pelagius in his \"''Letter to Ctesiphon''\" and \"''Dialogus contra Pelagianos''\". With Jerome at the time was [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], a visiting pupil of Augustine, with similar views on the dangers of Pelagianism. Together, they publicly condemned Pelagius. Bishop [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John of Jerusalem]], a personal friend of Pelagius, called a council in July 415. Church sources claim Orosius' lack of fluency in Greek rendered him unconvincing and John's Eastern background made him more willing to accept that humans did not have inherent sinfulness, yet the council rendered no verdict and passed the controversy to the Latin Church because Pelagius, Jerome, and Orosius were all Latin.\n\n=== Diospolis ===\nA few months later in December of 415, another synod in [[Lod|Diospolis]] (Lydda) under the bishop of C\u00e6sarea was called by two deposed bishops who came to the Holy Land. However, neither bishop attended for unrelated reasons and Orosius had left after consultation with Bishop John. Pelagius explained to the synod that he did believe God was necessary for salvation because every human is created by God. He also claimed that many works of [[Celestius]] did not represent his own views. He showed letters of recommendation by other authoritative figures including Augustine himself, who for all their disagreements, thought highly of Pelagius' character.\n\nThe [[Synod of Diospolis]] therefore concluded: \"Now since we have received satisfaction in respect of the charges brought against the monk Pelagius in his presence and since he gives his assent to sound doctrines but condemns and anathematises those contrary to the faith of the Church, we adjudge him to belong to the communion of the Catholic Church.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seanmultimedia.com/Pie_Pelagius_Synod_Lydda_415AD.html|title=Pie_Pelagius_Synod_Lydda_415AD|website=www.seanmultimedia.com|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n== Pelagius and the doctrine of free will ==\nAfter his acquittal in Diospolis, Pelagius wrote two major treatises which are no longer extant, ''On Nature'' and ''Defense of the Freedom of the Will''. In these he defends his position on sin and sinlessness, and accuses Augustine of being under the influence of [[Manichaeism]] by elevating evil to the same status as God and teaching pagan fatalism as if it were a Christian doctrine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nManichaeism stressed that the spirit was God-created, while material substance was corrupt and evil. Theologian Gerald Bonner felt that part of Pelagius' analysis was an over-reaction to Manicheanism. Pelagius held that everything created by God was good, therefore, he could not see how God had made humans fallen creatures.<ref>Bonner, Gerald. ''St. Augustine of Hippo: Life and Controversies'', Philadelphia: The Westminister Press, 1963</ref> (Augustine's teachings on the Fall of Adam was not a settled doctrine at the time the Augustinian/Pelagian dispute began.)\n\nThe view that mankind can avoid sinning, and that humans can freely choose to obey God's commandments, stands at the core of Pelagian teaching. Pelagius stressed human autonomy and freedom of the will.<ref name=Filippo/>\n\nAn illustration of Pelagius' views on man's \"moral ability\" not to sin can be found in his \"Letter to Demetrias\".<ref>[http://silouanthompson.net/library/early-church/pelagius-to-demetrias \"Letter of Pelagius to Demetrias\", ''The Letters of Pelagius'' (Robert Van de Weyer, ed.)]</ref> He was in the Holy Land when, in 413, he received a letter from the renowned [[Anicia (gens)|Anician]] family in Rome. One of the aristocratic ladies who had been among his followers, Anicia Juliana, was writing to a number of eminent Western theologians, including Jerome and possibly Augustine, for moral advice for her 14-year-old daughter, [[Demetrias (daughter of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius)|Demetrias]].  Pelagius used the letter to argue his case for morality, stressing his views of natural sanctity and man's moral capacity to choose to live a holy life.  It is perhaps the only extant writing in Pelagius' own hand, and it was thought to be a letter by Jerome for centuries, though Augustine himself references it in his work, ''On the Grace of Christ''.\n\n==Pelagius on grace==\n[[File:Pelagius.jpg|thumb|A 17th-century [[Calvinist]] print depicting Pelagius: The caption says:<br />\"Accurst Pelagius, with what false pretence<br />Durst thou excuse Man's foul Concupiscence,<br />Or cry down Sin Originall, or that<br /> The Love of GOD did Man predestinate.\"]]\nFor Pelagius, \"grace\" consisted of the gift of free will, the Law of Moses, and the teachings of Jesus.<ref>Stephen J. Duffy, Stephen J., ''The Dynamics of Grace: Perspectives in Theological Anthropology'', Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 1993</ref> With these, a person would be able to perceive the moral course of action and follow it. Prayer, fasting, and asceticism supported the will to do good. Augustine accused Pelagius of thinking of God's grace as consisting only of external helps.\n\nExtant letters of Pelagius and his followers claim that all good works are done only with the grace of God (which he saw as enabling, but not forcing, good works), that infants must be baptized for salvation, and that the saints were not always sinless, but that some at least have been able to stop sinning.\n\nHe instead said, \"This grace we for our part do not, as you suppose, allow to consist merely in the law, but also in the help of God. God helps us by His teaching and revelation, whilst He opens the eyes of our heart; whilst He points out to us the future, that we may not be absorbed in the present; whilst He discovers to us the snares of the devil; whilst He enlightens us with the manifold and ineffable gift of heavenly grace.\" In a letter to the Pope defending himself, he stated, \"This free will is in all good works always assisted by divine help\", and in an accompanying confession of faith, \"Free-will we do so own, as to say that we always stand in need of God's help\", However, he affirmed that \"We do also abhor the blasphemy of those who say that any impossible thing is commanded to man by God; or that the commandments of God cannot be performed by any one man\" (a statement which the pope approved of upon receiving the letter), whereas Augustine famously stated \"''non possum non peccare''\" (\"I cannot not sin\").\n\n==Pope Innocent I ==\nIn the fall of 416, Augustine and four other bishops wrote a letter urging [[Pope Innocent I]] to condemn Pelagianism.  Innocent I responded by rejecting the Pelagian teachings and excluding Pelagius and Celestius from communion with the Catholic Church until they should recant. Shortly after this, Innocent I died in March of 417.\n\n==Pope Zosimus ==\nSeeking to undo his condemnation, Pelagius wrote a letter and statement of belief to [[Pope Zosimus]], Innocent I's successor, showing himself to be orthodox. In these he articulated his beliefs so as not to contradict what the synods condemned.  Zosimus was persuaded by Celestius to reopen the case, but opposition from the African bishops and [[Honorius (emperor)|Emperor Honorius]] forced Zosimus to condemn and excommunicate Celestius and Pelagius in 418.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nPelagianism was condemned at the [[Council of Carthage (418)|Council of Carthage in 418]].<ref name=Filippo/>  Augustine, shocked that Pelagius and Celestius were not denounced as heretics, called the Council of Carthage in 418 and stated nine beliefs of the Church that Pelagianism denied:\n\n# Death came from sin, not man's physical nature.\n# Infants must be baptized to be cleansed from original sin.\n# Justifying grace covers past sins and helps avoid future sins.\n# The grace of Christ imparts strength and will to act out God's commandments.\n# No good works can come without God's grace.\n# We confess we are sinners because it is true, not from humility.\n# The saints ask for forgiveness for their own sins.\n# The saints also confess to be sinners because they are.\n# Children dying without baptism are excluded from both the kingdom of heaven and eternal life.\n\n== Death and later ==\nAfter his condemnation, Pelagius was expelled from Jerusalem, and Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria]] allowed him to settle in Egypt. He is not heard of thereafter.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHis death did not end his teachings, although those who followed him may have modified those teachings.  Because little information remains with regard to Pelagius' actual teachings, some of his doctrines possibly were subject to revision and suppression by his enemies (followers of Augustine and the Church leadership as a whole at that time).\n\nPelagius and Caelestius were declared heretics by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.<ref>Schaff, Philip. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.vii.html The Seven Ecumenical Councils: Excursus on Pelagianism], ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', series II, vol 14.</ref>\n\nBelief in Pelagianism and [[Semipelagianism]] was common for the next few centuries, especially in Britain, the Holy Land, and North Africa. [[Germanus of Auxerre|St Germanus]] visited Britain to combat Pelagianism in or around AD 429. In Wales, [[Saint David]] was credited with convening the [[Synod of Brefi]] and the [[Synod of Victory]] against the followers of Pelagius in the sixth century.\n\n==Evaluation==\nAn objective view of Pelagius and his effect is difficult. His name has been used as an epithet for centuries by both Protestants and Catholics, and he has had few defenders. The very early church denounced his ideas and the Reformation accused Roman Catholics of adhering to his beliefs and condemned both Pelagius and the Catholic Church. Modern scholarship suggests that Pelagius did not take the more extreme positions later associated with his followers.<ref name=Clark>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111006045016/http://americanphilosophy.net/pelagianheresy.htm Clark, R.

Powys referred approvingly to Pelagianism in his nonfiction book ''Obstinate Cymric'' (1947).\n\nThe Saint Augustine/Pelagius debate is mockingly discussed in the novel by [[Flann O'Brien]] titled ''[[The Dalkey Archive]]'', wherein Saint Augustine actually makes a ghostly appearance.\n\nThe government of the English-speaking Union (Enspun) in [[Anthony Burgess]]' ''[[The Wanting Seed]]'' is locked in a perpetual cycle, rotating between the 'Pel-Phase', named after Pelagius, and an Augustinian phase. The former is one of police and social services; the latter is characterized by martial law. Burgess took up the Augustine/Pelagius theme again in ''[[The Clockwork Testament, or Enderby's End|The Clockwork Testament]]'' and in ''[[Earthly Powers]]''.\n\nIn the movie ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'' (2004),<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/k/king-arthur-script-transcript.html \"King Arthur\"]</ref> Pelagius is a former mentor of young Lucius Artorius Castus ([[King Arthur|Arthur]]) played by Clive Owen. Arthur champions Pelagius' ideals, particularly those regarding free will. Upon learning of Pelagius's excommunication and death, Arthur realizes that the Roman ideal that he supported no longer exists.  He breaks ties with the [[Roman Empire]], and leads the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] against the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invaders.\n\nPelagius is the subject of a poem by the [[Glasgow]] poet [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]] (\"Cathures\", Carcanet 2002) which imagines that Pelagius has returned to his native Glasgow (Cathures) and that his Celtic name was Morgan.\n\n[[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], in his novel ''[[Emperor (Baxter novel)|Emperor]]'', imagines how time's tapestry would have looked had Pelagius' views and not Augustine's influenced the evolution of Christianity.

He was accused by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and others of denying the need for divine aid in performing [[good works]]. They understood him to have said that the only grace necessary was the declaration of the law; humans were not wounded by Adam's sin and were perfectly able to fulfill the law without divine aid. Pelagius denied Augustine's theory of [[original sin]]. Adherents of Pelagius cited [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 24:16 in support of their position. Pelagius was declared a [[heresy|heretic]] by the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. His interpretation of a doctrine of free will became known as [[Pelagianism]].\n\nHe was well educated, fluent in both [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and learned in [[theology]]. He spent time as an ascetic, focusing on practical asceticism. He was well known in Rome, both for the harsh asceticism of his public life and the power and persuasiveness of his speech. His reputation earned him praise early in his career even from such pillars of the Church as Augustine, who referred to him as a \"saintly man.\" However, he was later accused of lying about his own teachings to avoid public condemnation. Most of his later life was spent defending his doctrine against Christian theologians who held that Pelagius was spreading novelties in the Faith unknown to the apostolic tradition.\n\nDue to some calling him a heretic, little of his work has come down to the present day except in the quotes of his opponents. However, more recently, some authors have defended Pelagius as a misunderstood \u201corthodox\u201d:\n{{quote|Recent analysis of his thinking suggests that it was, in fact, highly orthodox, following in the tradition established by the early fathers and in keeping with the teaching of the church in both the East and the West. ...From what we are able to piece together from the few sources available ... it seems that the [[Celts|Celtic]] monk held to an orthodox view of the prevenience of God's grace, and did not assert that individuals could achieve salvation purely by their own efforts.<ref>Bradley, Ian (1993) ''The Celtic Way''.

In these, he defends his position on sin and sinlessness, and accuses Augustine of being under the influence of [[Manichaeism]] by elevating evil to the same status as God and teaching pagan fatalism as if it were a Christian doctrine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nManichaeism stressed that the spirit was God-created, while material substance was corrupt and evil. Theologian Gerald Bonner felt that part of Pelagius' analysis was an over-reaction to Manicheanism. Pelagius held that everything created by God was good, therefore, he could not see how God had made humans fallen creatures.<ref>Bonner, Gerald. ''St. Augustine of Hippo: Life and Controversies'', Philadelphia: The Westminister Press, 1963</ref> (Augustine's teachings on the Fall of Adam was not a settled doctrine at the time the Augustinian/Pelagian dispute began.)\n\nThe view that mankind can avoid sinning, and that humans can freely choose to obey God's commandments, stands at the core of Pelagian teaching. Pelagius stressed human autonomy and freedom of the will.<ref name=Filippo/>\n\nAn illustration of Pelagius' views on man's \"moral ability\" not to sin can be found in his \"Letter to Demetrias\".<ref>[http://silouanthompson.net/library/early-church/pelagius-to-demetrias \"Letter of Pelagius to Demetrias\", ''The Letters of Pelagius'' (Robert Van de Weyer, ed.)]</ref> He was in the Holy Land when, in 413, he received a letter from the renowned [[Anicia (gens)|Anician]] family in Rome. One of the aristocratic ladies who had been among his followers, Anicia Juliana, was writing to a number of eminent Western theologians, including Jerome and possibly Augustine, for moral advice for her 14-year-old daughter, [[Demetrias (daughter of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius)|Demetrias]].  Pelagius used the letter to argue his case for morality, stressing his views of natural sanctity and man's moral capacity to choose to live a holy life.  It is perhaps the only extant writing in Pelagius' own hand, and it was thought to be a letter by Jerome for centuries, though Augustine himself references it in his work, ''On the Grace of Christ''.\n\n==Pelagius on grace==\n[[File:Pelagius.jpg|thumb|A 17th-century [[Calvinist]] print depicting Pelagius: The caption says:<br />\"Accurst Pelagius, with what false pretence<br />Durst thou excuse Man's foul Concupiscence,<br />Or cry down Sin Originall, or that<br /> The Love of GOD did Man predestinate.\"]]\nFor Pelagius, \"grace\" consisted of the gift of free will, the Law of Moses, and the teachings of Jesus.<ref>Stephen J. Duffy, Stephen J., ''The Dynamics of Grace: Perspectives in Theological Anthropology'', Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 1993</ref> With these, a person would be able to perceive the moral course of action and follow it. Prayer, fasting, and asceticism supported the will to do good. Augustine accused Pelagius of thinking of God's grace as consisting only of external helps.\n\nExtant letters of Pelagius and his followers claim that all good works are done only with the grace of God (which he saw as enabling, but not forcing, good works), that infants must be baptized for salvation, and that the saints were not always sinless, but that some at least have been able to stop sinning.\n\nHe instead said, \"This grace we for our part do not, as you suppose, allow to consist merely in the law, but also in the help of God. God helps us by His teaching and revelation, whilst He opens the eyes of our heart; whilst He points out to us the future, that we may not be absorbed in the present; whilst He discovers to us the snares of the devil; whilst He enlightens us with the manifold and ineffable gift of heavenly grace.\" In a letter to the Pope defending himself, he stated, \"This free will is in all good works always assisted by divine help\", and in an accompanying confession of faith, \"Free-will we do so own, as to say that we always stand in need of God's help\", However, he affirmed that \"We do also abhor the blasphemy of those who say that any impossible thing is commanded to man by God; or that the commandments of God cannot be performed by any one man\" (a statement which the pope approved of upon receiving the letter), whereas Augustine famously stated \"''non possum non peccare''\" (\"I cannot not sin\").\n\n==Pope Innocent I ==\nIn the fall of 416, Augustine and four other bishops wrote a letter urging [[Pope Innocent I]] to condemn Pelagianism.  Innocent I responded by rejecting the Pelagian teachings and excluding Pelagius and Celestius from communion with the Catholic Church until they should recant. Shortly after this, Innocent I died in March of 417.\n\n==Pope Zosimus ==\nSeeking to undo his condemnation, Pelagius wrote a letter and statement of belief to [[Pope Zosimus]], Innocent I's successor, showing himself to be orthodox. In these he articulated his beliefs so as not to contradict what the synods condemned.  Zosimus was persuaded by Celestius to reopen the case, but opposition from the African bishops and [[Honorius (emperor)|Emperor Honorius]] forced Zosimus to condemn and excommunicate Celestius and Pelagius in 418.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nPelagianism was condemned at the [[Council of Carthage (418)|Council of Carthage in 418]].<ref name=Filippo/>  Augustine, shocked that Pelagius and Celestius were not denounced as heretics, called the Council of Carthage in 418 and stated nine beliefs of the Church that Pelagianism denied:\n\n# Death came from sin, not man's physical nature.\n# Infants must be baptized to be cleansed from original sin.\n# Justifying grace covers past sins and helps avoid future sins.\n# The grace of Christ imparts strength and will to act out God's commandments.\n# No good works can come without God's grace.\n# We confess we are sinners because it is true, not from humility.\n# The saints ask for forgiveness for their own sins.\n# The saints also confess to be sinners because they are.\n# Children dying without baptism are excluded from both the kingdom of heaven and eternal life.\n\n== Death and later ==\nAfter his condemnation, Pelagius was expelled from Jerusalem, and Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria]] allowed him to settle in Egypt. He is not heard of thereafter.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHis death did not end his teachings, although those who followed him may have modified those teachings.  Because little information remains with regard to Pelagius' actual teachings, some of his doctrines possibly were subject to revision and suppression by his enemies (followers of Augustine and the Church leadership as a whole at that time).\n\nPelagius and Caelestius were declared heretics by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.<ref>Schaff, Philip. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.vii.html The Seven Ecumenical Councils: Excursus on Pelagianism], ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', series II, vol 14.</ref>\n\nBelief in Pelagianism and [[Semipelagianism]] was common for the next few centuries, especially in Britain, the Holy Land, and North Africa. [[Germanus of Auxerre|St Germanus]] visited Britain to combat Pelagianism in or around AD 429. In Wales, [[Saint David]] was credited with convening the [[Synod of Brefi]] and the [[Synod of Victory]] against the followers of Pelagius in the sixth century.\n\n==Evaluation==\nAn objective view of Pelagius and his effect is difficult. His name has been used as an epithet for centuries by both Protestants and Catholics, and he has had few defenders. The very early church denounced his ideas and the Reformation accused Roman Catholics of adhering to his beliefs and condemned both Pelagius and the Catholic Church. Modern scholarship suggests that Pelagius did not take the more extreme positions later associated with his followers.<ref name=Clark>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111006045016/http://americanphilosophy.net/pelagianheresy.htm Clark, R.

Melbourne: Fairfax Digital]</ref>\n\nIn [[M J Trow]] and Richard Denham's 'Britannia' series, Pelagius is a character who has a huge moral impact on one of the four central characters, Vitalis, and his take on Christianity resonates throughout the rest of the series.\n\nPelagius is referred to in [[Stephen Lawhead]]'s book, ''The Black Rood''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lawhead |first1=Stephen R |title=The black rood |date=2000 |publisher=EOS |location=New York |isbn=9780061050343 |url=https://archive.org/details/blackrood00lawh |accessdate=19 January 2019 |language=English |url-access=registration }}</ref>, and makes an appearance in ''Patrick''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lawhead |first1=Stephen R |title=Patrick : Son of Ireland |date=2004 |publisher=HarperTorch |location=New York |isbn=9780060012823 |url=https://archive.org/details/patrick00step |accessdate=19 January 2019 |url-access=registration }}</ref>, where he has a discussion with the Hiberno-British saint.\n\nPelagius is frequently referred to in [[Jack Whyte]]'s series of books known as ''[[A Dream of Eagles]]'', where a major character's belief in Pelagius' ideas of free will and the laxity of the [[Roman Catholic]] Church eventually cause him to come into conflict with Church representatives.\n\n[[John Cowper Powys]]' novel ''[[Porius (A Romance of the Dark Ages)]]'' (1951) features the conflict between Augustinian/Pelagian beliefs, with the eponymous hero being a follower of Pelagius. Powys referred approvingly to Pelagianism in his nonfiction book ''Obstinate Cymric'' (1947).\n\nThe Saint Augustine/Pelagius debate is mockingly discussed in the novel by [[Flann O'Brien]] titled ''[[The Dalkey Archive]]'', wherein Saint Augustine actually makes a ghostly appearance.\n\nThe government of the English-speaking Union (Enspun) in [[Anthony Burgess]]' ''[[The Wanting Seed]]'' is locked in a perpetual cycle, rotating between the 'Pel-Phase', named after Pelagius, and an Augustinian phase. The former is one of police and social services; the latter is characterized by martial law. Burgess took up the Augustine/Pelagius theme again in ''[[The Clockwork Testament, or Enderby's End|The Clockwork Testament]]'' and in ''[[Earthly Powers]]''.\n\nIn the movie ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'' (2004),<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/k/king-arthur-script-transcript.html \"King Arthur\"]</ref> Pelagius is a former mentor of young Lucius Artorius Castus ([[King Arthur|Arthur]]) played by Clive Owen. Arthur champions Pelagius' ideals, particularly those regarding free will. Upon learning of Pelagius's excommunication and death, Arthur realizes that the Roman ideal that he supported no longer exists.  He breaks ties with the [[Roman Empire]], and leads the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] against the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invaders.\n\nPelagius is the subject of a poem by the [[Glasgow]] poet [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]] (\"Cathures\", Carcanet 2002) which imagines that Pelagius has returned to his native Glasgow (Cathures) and that his Celtic name was Morgan.\n\n[[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], in his novel ''[[Emperor (Baxter novel)|Emperor]]'', imagines how time's tapestry would have looked had Pelagius' views and not Augustine's influenced the evolution of Christianity.  He also portrays the Emperor Constantine's actions as having dealt a harsh blow, but not necessarily a mortal one, to Pelagius' teaching that humans are free and sin is not inherent in us.\n\nA facsimile of the 1808 \"A Dissertation of the Pelagian Heresy and the Refutation of it al Llandewi Brevi by St David\" has been printed in [[Carmarthen]] on the same street as the original.\n\n''Heresy: the Life of Pelagius'' (2012) by David Lovejoy, portrays Pelagius through the eyes of his (fictional) servant Arwel.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=794693050&qt=results_page Heresy: the Life of Pelagius by David Lovejoy, Echo Publications]</ref>\n\nIn his [[Sister Fidelma mysteries|Sister Fidelma mystery series]] (1994\u2013present), author Peter Berresford Ellis, under the pen name Peter Tremayne, uses the teachings of Pelagius to contrast the dogma and practices of the contemporary Celtic church and that of Rome for supremacy in the British Isles.\n\n== Writings==\nPelagius wrote: ''De fide Trinitatis libri \u2162'' (\"On Faith in the Trinity: Three Books\"), ''Eclogarum ex divinis Scripturis liber primus'' (\"Excerpts out of Divine Scriptures: Book One\"), and ''Commentarii in epistolas S. Pauli'' (\"Commentary on the Epistles of Saint Paul\").  Unfortunately, most of his work survives only in the quotations of his opponents.
