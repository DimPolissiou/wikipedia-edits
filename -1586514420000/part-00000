He was the second among the [[Kangxi Emperor]]'s sons to survive into adulthood and was designated as [[Heir apparent|Crown Prince]] for two terms between 1675 and 1712 before being deposed. He was posthumously honoured as '''Prince Limi of the First Rank'''.\n\n==Life==\nYunreng was born of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Aisin Gioro]] clan as the seventh son of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], but was the second among the emperor's sons to survive into adulthood. He was given the infant name \"Baocheng\" (\u4fdd\u6210), and was renamed \"Yinreng\" when he became older. His mother was the Kangxi Emperor's first empress, [[Empress Xiaochengren]] from the [[He\u0161eri]] clan, who was also a granddaughter of [[He\u0161eri Sonin|Sonin]] (one of the [[Four Regents of the Kangxi Emperor|four regents]] in the Kangxi Emperor's early reign). She died not long after giving birth to Yinreng, and was greatly lamented by the Kangxi Emperor.\n\nThe Kangxi Emperor personally taught Yinreng to read and he proclaimed Yinreng as his [[Crown prince|Crown Prince]] when Yinreng was only a year old. Under the tutelage of several scholar-officials, Yinreng became well-versed in the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Manchu language|Manchu]] languages. Between 1696 and 1697, when the Kangxi Emperor was away twice on military campaigns against [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan|Galdan Khan]] of the [[Zunghar Khanate]], Yinreng was appointed as regent to supervise affairs in the imperial capital, [[Beijing]]. Despite scandals and accusations of immorality, Yinreng remained in his father's favour and was given the Western Gardens (\u897f\u82b1\u5712) of Beijing as his residence.\n\nIn 1703, Yinreng's granduncle [[Songgotu]] was found guilty of attempting to murder the Kangxi Emperor, along with a series of corruption charges, and was imprisoned and died shortly afterwards. Yinreng gradually fell out of his father's favour as a result. In 1708, during a hunting expedition in [[Rehe Province|Rehe]], the Kangxi Emperor accused Yinreng of immorality, sexual impropriety, usurping power, and treason. Yinreng was stripped of his position as Crown Prince and imprisoned. When it was later discovered that the First Prince [[Yinzhi, Prince Zhi|Yinzhi]] had employed [[lama]]s to cast evil spells on Yinreng, the Kangxi Emperor pardoned Yinreng in 1709 and restored him as Crown Prince. In the following three years, Yinreng's condition deteriorated and the Kangxi Emperor became convinced that Yinreng was insane. Consequently, in 1712, Yinreng was deposed again and placed in perpetual confinement.\n\nIn 1722, the Kangxi Emperor died and was succeeded by his fourth son Yinzhen, who became historically known as the [[Yongzheng Emperor]]. Yinreng changed his name to Yunreng to avoid [[naming taboo]] because the Chinese character for \"Yin\" (\u80e4) in \"Yinreng\" is the same as the one in the Yongzheng Emperor's personal name \"Yinzhen\" (\u80e4\u799b). Yunreng died three years later in 1725 while still being incarcerated. He was granted the posthumous title of \"[[Prince Li (\u7406)|Prince Limi of the First Rank]]\" (\u548c\u78a9\u7406\u5bc6\u89aa\u738b).\n\nThe bitter factionalism between the Kangxi Emperor's sons and the dispute over the succession prompted the Yongzheng Emperor to establish a practice of writing a secret imperial edict on who would succeed to the throne, and sealing the edict in a box behind a tablet in the [[Palace of Heavenly Purity]] in the [[Forbidden City]]. The edict would only be publicly revealed upon the death of the reigning emperor.\n\n==Family==\n* Father: Xuanye, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] ({{lang|zh|\u8056\u7956 \u7384\u71c1}}; 4 May 1654 \u2013 20 December 1722)\n** Grandfather: Fulin, the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] ({{lang|zh|\u4e16\u7956 \u798f\u81e8}}; 15 March 1638 \u2013 5 February 1661)\n** Grandmother: [[Empress Xiaokangzhang]], of the [[Tunggiya]] clan ({{lang|zh|\u5b5d\u5eb7\u7ae0\u7687\u540e \u4f5f\u4f73\u6c0f}}; 1638 \u2013 20 March 1663)\n* Mother: [[Empress Xiaochengren]], of the [[He\u0161eri]] clan ({{lang|zh|\u5b5d\u8aa0\u4ec1\u7687\u540e \u8d6b\u820d\u91cc\u6c0f}}; 3 February 1654 \u2013 6 June 1674)\n** Grandfather: [[Gabula (general)|Gabula]] (d. 1681), served as a first rank military official ({{lang|zh|\u9818\u4f8d\u885b\u5167\u5927\u81e3}}), and held the title of a first class duke ({{lang|zh|\u4e00\u7b49\u516c}})\n----\n* Consorts and Issue:\n** Primary consort, of the [[G\u016bwalgiya]] clan ({{lang|zh|\u5ae1\u798f\u6649 \u74dc\u723e\u4f73\u6c0f}}; d.

He was the second among the [[Kangxi Emperor]]'s sons to survive into adulthood and was designated as [[Heir apparent|Crown Prince]] for two terms between 1675 and 1712 before being deposed. He was posthumously honoured as '''Prince Limi of the First Rank'''.\n\n==Life==\nYunreng was born of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Aisin Gioro]] clan as the seventh son of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], but was the second among the emperor's sons to survive into adulthood. He was given the infant name \"Baocheng\" (\u4fdd\u6210), and was renamed \"Yinreng\" when he became older. His mother was the Kangxi Emperor's first empress, [[Empress Xiaochengren]] from the [[He\u0161eri]] clan, who was also a granddaughter of [[He\u0161eri Sonin|Sonin]] (one of the [[Four Regents of the Kangxi Emperor|four regents]] in the Kangxi Emperor's early reign). She died not long after giving birth to Yinreng, and was greatly lamented by the Kangxi Emperor.\n\nThe Kangxi Emperor personally taught Yinreng to read and he proclaimed Yinreng as his [[Crown prince|Crown Prince]] when Yinreng was only a year old. Under the tutelage of several scholar-officials, Yinreng became well-versed in the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Manchu language|Manchu]] languages. Between 1696 and 1697, when the Kangxi Emperor was away twice on military campaigns against [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan|Galdan Khan]] of the [[Zunghar Khanate]], Yinreng was appointed as regent to supervise affairs in the imperial capital, [[Beijing]]. Despite scandals and accusations of immorality, Yinreng remained in his father's favour and was given the Western Gardens (\u897f\u82b1\u5712) of Beijing as his residence.\n\nIn 1703, Yinreng's granduncle [[Songgotu]] was found guilty of attempting to murder the Kangxi Emperor, along with a series of corruption charges, and was imprisoned and died shortly afterwards. Yinreng gradually fell out of his father's favour as a result. In 1708, during a hunting expedition in [[Rehe Province|Rehe]], the Kangxi Emperor accused Yinreng of immorality, sexual impropriety, usurping power, and treason. Yinreng was stripped off his position as Crown Prince and imprisoned. When it was later discovered that the First Prince [[Yinzhi, Prince Zhi|Yinzhi]] had employed [[lama]]s to cast evil spells on Yinreng, the Kangxi Emperor pardoned Yinreng in 1709 and restored him as Crown Prince. In the following three years, Yinreng's condition deteriorated and the Kangxi Emperor became convinced that Yinreng was insane. Consequently, in 1712, Yinreng was deposed again and placed in perpetual confinement.\n\nIn 1722, the Kangxi Emperor died and was succeeded by his fourth son Yinzhen, who became historically known as the [[Yongzheng Emperor]]. Yinreng changed his name to Yunreng to avoid [[naming taboo]] because the Chinese character for \"Yin\" (\u80e4) in \"Yinreng\" is the same as the one in the Yongzheng Emperor's personal name \"Yinzhen\" (\u80e4\u799b). Yunreng died three years later in 1725 while still being incarcerated. He was granted the posthumous title of \"[[Prince Li (\u7406)|Prince Limi of the First Rank]]\" (\u548c\u78a9\u7406\u5bc6\u89aa\u738b).\n\nThe bitter factionalism between the Kangxi Emperor's sons and the dispute over the succession prompted the Yongzheng Emperor to establish a practice of writing a secret imperial edict on who would succeed to the throne, and sealing the edict in a box behind a tablet in the [[Palace of Heavenly Purity]] in the [[Forbidden City]]. The edict would only be publicly revealed upon the death of the reigning emperor.\n\n==Family==\n* Father: Xuanye, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] ({{lang|zh|\u8056\u7956 \u7384\u71c1}}; 4 May 1654 \u2013 20 December 1722)\n** Grandfather: Fulin, the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] ({{lang|zh|\u4e16\u7956 \u798f\u81e8}}; 15 March 1638 \u2013 5 February 1661)\n** Grandmother: [[Empress Xiaokangzhang]], of the [[Tunggiya]] clan ({{lang|zh|\u5b5d\u5eb7\u7ae0\u7687\u540e \u4f5f\u4f73\u6c0f}}; 1638 \u2013 20 March 1663)\n* Mother: [[Empress Xiaochengren]], of the [[He\u0161eri]] clan ({{lang|zh|\u5b5d\u8aa0\u4ec1\u7687\u540e \u8d6b\u820d\u91cc\u6c0f}}; 3 February 1654 \u2013 6 June 1674)\n** Grandfather: [[Gabula (general)|Gabula]] (d. 1681), served as a first rank military official ({{lang|zh|\u9818\u4f8d\u885b\u5167\u5927\u81e3}}), and held the title of a first class duke ({{lang|zh|\u4e00\u7b49\u516c}})\n----\n* Consorts and Issue:\n** Primary consort, of the [[G\u016bwalgiya]] clan ({{lang|zh|\u5ae1\u798f\u6649 \u74dc\u723e\u4f73\u6c0f}}; d.

Causes of this demographic regress are among others the problems of the metalworking industry and the high unemployment, making many young people leave the town and move into regional centers such as [[Timi\u0219oara]] and other areas of Romania.\n\n92.98% of inhabitants are [[Romanians]], 2.09% [[Germans]], 3.23% [[Hungarians]] and 0.86% [[Roma in Romania|Roma]]. After 1989, most of the town's Germans, [[Italians]] and [[Slovaks]] emigrated. In 2002, 76.7% of residents were [[Romanian Orthodox]], 11.4% [[Roman Catholic]], 4.8% [[Pentecostal Union of Romania|Pentecostal]], 4.4% [[Baptist Union of Romania|Baptist]] and 1% [[Reformed Church of Romania|Reformed]].\n\n==Education==\nThe town has three schools and one industrial high school.\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|O\u021belu Ro\u0219u}}\n* [http://www.otelu-rosu.ro www.otelu-rosu.ro]\n\n{{Cara\u0219-Severin County}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Otelu Rosu}}\n[[Category:Populated places in Cara\u0219-Severin County]]\n[[Category:Towns in Romania]]\n[[Category:Monotowns in Romania]]\n[[Category:Localities in Romanian Banat]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%C8%9Belu_Ro%C8%99u"}
