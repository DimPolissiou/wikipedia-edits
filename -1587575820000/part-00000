Oliver and Luke bond after the wedding. The following day, Oliver appears at Luke's house and asks to stay with him. Luke agrees and is surprised to discover that Oliver has run away from Scarlett. When Scarlett returns and tries to take Oliver back to their home, Oliver insists to Scarlett that he wants to remain with Luke so Scarlett tearfully leaves the village. Oliver joins the football academy run by [[#Buster Smith|Buster Smith]] (Nathan Sussex) a former football champion player from back in the day from when he was much younger back then. Over the next few weeks, Oliver becomes closer to Buster confiding in him over situations in his home life such as his discovery that his father had been raped when he was younger after being told this by friend and also a member of Buster's football academy [[Imran Maalik]] (Ijaz Rana). Oliver has also been confiding in Buster and putting all of his trust in him such as telling Buster about his biological dad and new stepmum Mandy always arguing day in and day out and his dad turning back to the drink again after being an alcoholic before.\n\nIt is revealed on-screen that Buster is a paedophile who groomed and sexually abused his son [[Damon Kinsella]]'s (Jacob Roberts) best friend, [[Brody Hudson]] (Adam Woodward), when he was an underage teenager, until his ex-wife and Damon's mother, [[Maggie Kinsella]] ([[Michelle Holmes]]), threatened him into leaving so that she could then protect vulnerable Brody from him and he now appears to be grooming Oliver as his next victim. After Oliver is injured while playing a game of football with Buster outside of The Bean Cafe, Buster takes him back to the changing rooms at the football academy and begins massaging his leg while also staring at Oliver lustfully. A few weeks later, when Oliver and Buster are alone together in the changing rooms at the football academy, Buster is telling Oliver about his potential when Oliver's leg injury comes back and Buster tells him to lie down on the bench so he can then properly examine it and shuts the door behind them. Oliver then runs out of the changing rooms scared and confused and although it is not specified on screen, it is implied that Buster has touched Oliver inappropriately. Oliver becomes traumatised but because of Luke's continued drinking, he feels that he cannot tell anyone so quits the football team instead but is convinced to re-join the football team again by Luke. Buster begins manipulating Oliver by telling him that he must prove to him of how much that he truly wants to be back on the football team again.\n\nOliver meets autistic teenager [[#Brooke Hathaway|Brooke Hathaway]] (Talia Grant) and develops an instant attraction with the two seemingly hitting it off at The Bean Coffee Shop. Brooke later comes to watch Oliver play but after he underperforms, Buster takes him to the changing rooms at the football academy to berate him for being distracted today. He puts his hand on Oliver's knee inappropriately but this is witnessed secretly by Brooke. Oliver feels uncomfortable with Buster doing this to him and he rushes out of the football academy to get away from Buster. Oliver and Mandy run into Brooke the next day with [[Nancy Hayton|Nancy Osborne]] ([[Jessica Fox (actress)|Jessica Fox]]) and Mandy teases that Oliver likes Brooke. Brooke then responds that Oliver is gay as she misinterpreted what she saw between Buster and Oliver yesterday with Brooke unaware that Buster is actually grooming Oliver. Oliver then shouts at Brooke causing her to have a breakdown after Oliver leaves. When he returns home, Mandy tries to get Oliver to open up to her but before he can say anything, they are interrupted by a drunken Luke. Oliver starts berating his father and stepmother before storming out of the house upset. Oliver then talks to Buster alone in the football academy changing rooms as he didn't know who else to turn to. Buster then manipulates the vulnerable teen by saying to Oliver that he can make him a star footballer with Buster's coaching skills as long as he does everything that he's told. He then places his hand on Oliver's knee inappropriately once again. He then asks Oliver if he understands or not. Oliver then tells him that he does understand before Buster shuts the door behind them to continue his abuse of the vulnerable poor youngster. When Buster is trying to raise money for Tony Hutchinson and Diane Hutchinson's gravely four-year-old daughter Dee Dee Hutchinson for Dee Dee to go to Disneyland Paris and is asking local businesses to donate, he bumps into Oliver in the village and see's Oliver alone and goes up to him and asks him if he wants to help him to raise the money and Oliver agrees to help him. After they've raised enough money for Dee Dee, Buster gives Oliver a mobile phone and tells Oliver to text him at any time about anything. Buster then tells him not to tell anyone else about it and Oliver agrees.\n\nAs Buster's sexual abuse continued, Oliver confessed to [[Scott Drinkwell]] ([[Ross Adams]]) that he is confused about his sexuality. He tells Scott that he knows that he likes girls but he also thinks  that he might be gay as well and has been aggressively trying to pursue Brooke in order to cover it up. Scott is sympathetic with him and encourages him to talk to Luke about it. Oliver is unable to go through with it though and accidentally tells Luke that Scott has been harassing him instead. After Luke confronts Scott, Luke warns him to stay away from his teenage son for now on with him thinking that Scott is being inappropriate with him due to Oliver being underage. Oliver tries to apologise to Scott but when Scott tells him that he has to deal with his sexuality rather than ignore it though, Oliver is then homophobic towards Scott as a result by calling him a puff and then runs away. He attempts to speak to Luke again but finds him drinking in the restaurant with best mate Darren Osbourne instead though which results in Oliver crying his eyes out when he see's Luke and him drinking together in the Hutch restaurant and witness's this from outside with Luke not realising that his own son saw him drinking once again. Buster lies to Oliver by telling him that Scott has agreed to let Oliver be the poster boy for the Bean. Buster takes several intimate photographs of Oliver when they're alone together at the football academy changing rooms which he later confesses to Luke. As Luke is drunk at the time though, Oliver makes him promise to wait until he is sober before confronting Buster. The next morning though however, Luke cannot remember anything at all about what Oliver was saying to him causing Oliver to angrily confront him and reveal to him that he knows that Luke was raped years ago. Luke then explains to Oliver that he began drinking as a way to cope with the abuse that he suffered back then. Buster later convinces Oliver that telling Luke anything will put unnecessary pressure on his dad and tells him that his dad is an alcoholic and people like him only care about where the next drink is going to come from and that they're too distracted to think about their loved ones instead as well so Oliver agrees to keep quiet but later steals a bottle of wine though and begins drinking in secret in order to cope with everything that's happened. Brody later convinces Oliver to report Buster to the police and he is arrested. Buster pleads not guilty at the hearing and Oliver lashes out at Brooke, but soon apologises to her.\n\nOliver is disgusted when the truth about Imran is revealed. Him and Brooke get closer but Brooke is told by Nancy that she could not be friends with him, but eventually they become friends again. During Buster's trial, Oliver is ripped to pieces by Buster's defence team and because of this, he agrees that Brooke would not be able to cope giving evidence. Imran reveals that Buster attempted to sexually assault him in Barcelona, shocking everybody. Buster is found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison. Oliver and Brooke begin dating after almost sharing a kiss. Brooke becomes pregnant and whilst Oliver is excited, Brooke doesn\u2019t feel ready so they arrange for the baby\u2019s adoption. Brooke later gives birth to a son, Thierry.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Buster Smith==\n{{infobox soap character \n|series = Hollyoaks\n|name = Buster Smith\n|portrayer = Nathan Sussex\n|years = 2018\u20132019\n|first = 29 January 2018\n|last = 11 January 2019\n|introducer = [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]]\n|classification = [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2019|Former; regular]]\n|sons = [[Damon Kinsella]]\n|wife = [[Maggie Kinsella]] (backstory)\n}}\n'''Buster Smith''', played by Nathan Sussex, made his first screen appearance on 29 January 2018.<ref name=\"Damon father\"/> The character and Sussex's casting details were announced on 23 January 2018.<ref name=\"Damon father\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a848131/hollyoaks-spoilers-damon-kinsella-dad-buster/|title=Hollyoaks reveals new family tensions as Damon Kinsella's father Buster arrives|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=23 January 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref> Buster is the father of [[Damon Kinsella]] (Jacob Roberts) and arrives following the death of his former wife and Damon's mother, [[Maggie Kinsella]] ([[Michelle Holmes]]).<ref name=\"Buster\"/> Buster is described as \"quite a charming character\", who gets along with everyone.

Breda arrives in the village following Sylver's release from prison, and insists that Goldie give him a place to stay. However, when Goldie refuses, Breda resorts to \"crafty\" measures. On her character, Brady commented that she was a \"strong and colourful individual\" and that she didn't have \"a lot of fear for authority.\" Brady also said that \"Breda comes from the firm but fair school of motherhood,\" and described her as a \"tigress.\" With Sylver having been in prison, Breda kept tabs on him, but Brady said that Breda doesn't have a favourite child and that as her character becomes more settled in the village, her love for Goldie would shine through.<ref name=\"Breda\"/>\n\nArriving in Hollyoaks to stay with the McQueens', Breda began working as a nanny for [[Leela Lomax]] ([[Kirsty-Leigh Porter]]) \u2013 but secretly agreed to \"two time\" Leela by working for [[Jack Osborne]] ([[Jimmy McKenna]]) too. Jack tried to cover for Breda by pretending they were in a relationship \u2013 much to Leela's amusement. Leela figured it out and allowed Breda to be nanny to both her and Jack. Eventually, Breda's friendship with Jack would turn into a real relationship.\n\nOn [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) and [[Russ Owen]]'s ([[Stuart Manning]]) wedding day in November 2018, it was shockingly revealed that Breda was a serial killer. Breda discovered that Russ had been unfaithful with Goldie, resulting in a pregnancy, and had pressurised her into aborting their child. Enraged, Breda murdered Russ. She was then revealed to have killed [[Glenn Donovan]] (Bob Cryer) and [[Carl Costello]] ([[Paul Opacic]]) for being \"sinners\" and \"dead beat dads\". In January 2019 Breda took revenge on [[Louis Loveday]] ([[Karl Collins]]) for cheating with three women, Leela, [[Simone Loveday]] ([[Jacqueline Boatswain]]) and Simone's sister, [[#Martine Deveraux|Martine Deveraux]] ([[K\u00e9ll\u00e9 Bryan]]) pushing some shelving onto him as he called for a taxi to leave town. Breda moved Louis to an old pig farm once owned by her parents making out she was caring for him and took him there to recover, Louis discovered Breda was responsible for the deaths of Carl, Glenn and Russ whilst writing a letter to Simone and attempted to escape but was thwarted when Breda returned to the farm. She puts him back into bed and believes him when he says it's Leela he wants to be with, Breda makes tea and as she strips the bed Louis switches the cups which Breda notices, just then Simone arrives at the farm calling for Breda, before Louis can react Breda smothers him keeping him from shouting to Simone. Breda goes to Simone and gets a lift to the village, meanwhile, Louis escapes and Breda finds him hiding in the barn. She says she's going to make some tea but then spots the letter confessing to the murders that Louis found. Louis begs for his life but Breda kills him by bludgeoning him with a telephone. She returns to Leela telling her to move on. Later at the farm Breda burns Louis' clothes and mobile phone in a metal canister. When she leaves a mysterious hooded figure takes Louis's phone and removes the sim card. The hooded figure is later revealed as [[Mac Nightingale]] ([[David Easter]]), who begins to blackmail Breda. He orders her to murder his son [[James Nightingale (Hollyoaks)|James Nightingale]] ([[Gregory Finnegan]]), much to her reluctance. Eventually, she slips poison into his coffee, and James collapses on a park bench. She later bakes a lasagne, which Mac eats in celebration, but is stunned to realise Breda has poisoned that, too. She reveals James will be fine, and she always intended to kill Mac, who in a weakened state tries to attack her but she kills him by hitting him with the lasagne dish. In July 2019, it is revealed that it was Breda who killed Vinnie, not Sylver, as he survived the fall, but Breda finished him off, and let Sylver take the blame. Later in the month, Breda planned to kill [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]) after he confessed his past mistakes to her but Breda did not kill him, after learning [[Harry Thompson (Hollyoaks)|Harry Thompson]] ([[Parry Glasspool]]) was going on the run. Breda fatally stabs Harry in an alleyway believing he was a bad dad for abandoning his son Isaac. Harry then died as a result of his injuries. Tony later discovers that Breda killed his son and she stabs Tony in the stomach. It was later revealed that Breda was keeping Tony prisoner at the pig farm. \n\nIn October 2019, Breda's family begin to get suspicious of where she is going all the time. Goldie learns she's going to the pig farm and Breda lies that she is mentally ill. Breda pretends to have dementia, but when Goldie finds her at the pig farm again, Breda confesses to killing Harry. She blames it on her \"dementia\" and Goldie agrees to keep it a secret. Breda's killing spree comes to an end when Sylver, Goldie and Mercedes and [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) all find out her serial killer secret. Mercedes finds Tony at the pig farm but Breda sneaks up and attacks her, after stabbing Tony again and locking Mercedes in the cage too, which she and Tony eventually escape from. After a heated confrontation in the house, Breda shoots Sylver with a bolt gun and sets the pig farm on fire. Mercedes stops Breda from killing her and Sylver as the house burns, the two of them fight, as Breda attacks Mercedes with a shard of glass Sylver uses his last ounce of strength to stab Breda in the head with two [[knitting needle]]s, killing her instantly.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Sylver McQueen==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series= Hollyoaks\n| name= Sylver McQueen\n| years=  2018\u2013\n| portrayer= David Tag\n| first= 27 June 2018\n|spinoffs=''[[Hollyoaks Later]]'' (2020)\n| introducer= [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]]\n| classification= [[List of Hollyoaks characters#Present characters|Present; regular]]\n| alias = Sylvester McQueen (adopted full name)<br />Peter Leilis (birth name)\n| family=[[McQueen family|McQueen]]\n| adoptivemother=[[Breda McQueen]]\n| stepfather=Vinnie Bletcher (adoptive)\n| stepsons= [[Bobby Costello]]<br>[[Max McQueen (Hollyoaks)|Max McQueen]] (adoptive) \n| father = Wes Leilis\n| mother=Harriet Leilis\n| halfsisters=[[Goldie McQueen]] (adoptive)\n| nephews=[[Prince McQueen]] (adoptive)<br/>[[Hunter McQueen]] (adoptive)\n| wife= [[Mercedes McQueen]] (2019\u2013)\n| daughters = [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2020)#Cher|Cher McQueen]]<ref name = \"Sylvers Daughter>{{cite web url=https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/metro.co.uk/2020/04/12/cher-cast-hollyoaks-yeah-heard-12547332/amp/|title=Cher has been cast in Hollyoaks to confront a killer \u2013 yeah, you heard|last=Lindsay|first=Duncan|date=12 April 2020|work = Metro|publisher= Duncan Lindsay|accessdate= 1 April 2020}}</ref>\n|}}\n'''Sylvester \"Sylver\" McQueen''' , played by David Tag, made his first on screen appearance on 27 June 2018.<ref name=\"Sylver details\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a860267/hollyoaks-spoilers-david-tag-sylver-mcqueen-arrival/|title=Hollyoaks newcomer David Tag reveals all on Sylver McQueen's arrival|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=26 June 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=26 June 2018}}</ref> The character and Tag's casting details were announced on 22 May 2018.<ref name=\"Sylver\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a857708/hollyoak-casts-goldie-mcqueen-brother-sylver/|title=Hollyoaks to introduce Goldie McQueen's brother Sylver as new regular|last=Harp|first=Justin|date=22 May 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=22 May 2018}}</ref> Tag previously appeared in the series as [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2016)#PCSO Rocco|PCSO Rocco]] in May 2016.<ref name=\"Sylver\"/> Sylver is a member of the established [[McQueen family]] and the half-brother of [[Goldie McQueen]] ([[Chelsee Healey]]).

Romeo is locked up for Mac's murder, but is later released when Donna-Marie is tricked by James into confessing. \n\nRomeo tries to comfort James when he found out that Harry was murdered, but James hits Romeo. Things gets worse when James began abusing Romeo, and Romeo moved out and secretly stayed in the Maalik's empty household. He was found by [[Peri Lomax]] ([[Ruby O'Donnell]]), who threatened to tell his grandmother, [[Marnie Nightingale]] ([[Lysette Anthony]]), but Romeo confess to Peri that James hit him, and the reason why he stayed at the Maalik's. \n\nPeri visits Romeo the next day and told him about the day she found out that her 'parents' are her grandparents, and advices Romeo to keep talking to James. Marnie later finds Romeo, when Peri told Marnie what had happened. Marnie reasons with Romeo that James had regretted for what he did and Marnie takes Romeo home, only to find James about to attack Juliet. Romeo comforts James when he, Juliet and Marnie attended to Harry's funeral. \n\nWhen Juliet starts hanging out with [[Sid Sumner]] (Billy Price), the son of the Far-Right Group leader, [[Stuart Sumner]] ([[Chris Simmons]]), Romeo tells him to stay away.

Oliver and Luke bond after the wedding. The following day, Oliver appears at Luke's house and asks to stay with him. Luke agrees and is surprised to discover that Oliver has run away from Scarlett. When Scarlett returns and tries to take Oliver back to their home, Oliver insists to Scarlett that he wants to remain with Luke so Scarlett tearfully leaves the village. Oliver joins the football academy run by [[#Buster Smith|Buster Smith]] (Nathan Sussex) a former football champion player from back in the day from when he was much younger back then. Over the next few weeks, Oliver becomes closer to Buster confiding in him over situations in his home life such as his discovery that his father had been raped when he was younger after being told this by friend and also a member of Buster's football academy [[Imran Maalik]] (Ijaz Rana). Oliver has also been confiding in Buster and putting all of his trust in him such as telling Buster about his biological dad and new stepmum Mandy always arguing day in and day out and his dad turning back to the drink again after being an alcoholic before.\n\nIt is revealed on-screen that Buster is a paedophile who groomed and sexually abused his son [[Damon Kinsella]]'s (Jacob Roberts) best friend, [[Brody Hudson]] (Adam Woodward), when he was an underage teenager, until his ex-wife and Damon's mother, [[Maggie Kinsella]] ([[Michelle Holmes]]), threatened him into leaving so that she could then protect vulnerable Brody from him and he now appears to be grooming Oliver as his next victim. After Oliver is injured while playing a game of football with Buster outside of The Bean Cafe, Buster takes him back to the changing rooms at the football academy and begins massaging his leg while also staring at Oliver lustfully. A few weeks later, when Oliver and Buster are alone together in the changing rooms at the football academy, Buster is telling Oliver about his potential when Oliver's leg injury comes back and Buster tells him to lie down on the bench so he can then properly examine it and shuts the door behind them. Oliver then runs out of the changing rooms scared and confused and although it is not specified on screen, it is implied that Buster has touched Oliver inappropriately. Oliver becomes traumatised but because of Luke's continued drinking, he feels that he cannot tell anyone so quits the football team instead but is convinced to re-join the football team again by Luke. Buster begins manipulating Oliver by telling him that he must prove to him of how much that he truly wants to be back on the football team again.\n\nOliver meets autistic teenager [[#Brooke Hathaway|Brooke Hathaway]] (Talia Grant) and develops an instant attraction with the two seemingly hitting it off at The Bean Coffee Shop. Brooke later comes to watch Oliver play but after he underperforms, Buster takes him to the changing rooms at the football academy to berate him for being distracted today. He puts his hand on Oliver's knee inappropriately but this is witnessed secretly by Brooke. Oliver feels uncomfortable with Buster doing this to him and he rushes out of the football academy to get away from Buster. Oliver and Mandy run into Brooke the next day with [[Nancy Hayton|Nancy Osborne]] ([[Jessica Fox (actress)|Jessica Fox]]) and Mandy teases that Oliver likes Brooke. Brooke then responds that Oliver is gay as she misinterpreted what she saw between Buster and Oliver yesterday with Brooke unaware that Buster is actually grooming Oliver. Oliver then shouts at Brooke causing her to have a breakdown after Oliver leaves. When he returns home, Mandy tries to get Oliver to open up to her but before he can say anything, they are interrupted by a drunken Luke. Oliver starts berating his father and stepmother before storming out of the house upset. Oliver then talks to Buster alone in the football academy changing rooms as he didn't know who else to turn to. Buster then manipulates the vulnerable teen by saying to Oliver that he can make him a star footballer with Buster's coaching skills as long as he does everything that he's told. He then places his hand on Oliver's knee inappropriately once again. He then asks Oliver if he understands or not. Oliver then tells him that he does understand before Buster shuts the door behind them to continue his abuse of the vulnerable poor youngster. When Buster is trying to raise money for Tony Hutchinson and Diane Hutchinson's gravely four-year-old daughter Dee Dee Hutchinson for Dee Dee to go to Disneyland Paris and is asking local businesses to donate, he bumps into Oliver in the village and see's Oliver alone and goes up to him and asks him if he wants to help him to raise the money and Oliver agrees to help him. After they've raised enough money for Dee Dee, Buster gives Oliver a mobile phone and tells Oliver to text him at any time about anything. Buster then tells him not to tell anyone else about it and Oliver agrees.\n\nAs Buster's sexual abuse continued, Oliver confessed to [[Scott Drinkwell]] ([[Ross Adams]]) that he is confused about his sexuality. He tells Scott that he knows that he likes girls but he also thinks  that he might be gay as well and has been aggressively trying to pursue Brooke in order to cover it up. Scott is sympathetic with him and encourages him to talk to Luke about it. Oliver is unable to go through with it though and accidentally tells Luke that Scott has been harassing him instead. After Luke confronts Scott, Luke warns him to stay away from his teenage son for now on with him thinking that Scott is being inappropriate with him due to Oliver being underage. Oliver tries to apologise to Scott but when Scott tells him that he has to deal with his sexuality rather than ignore it though, Oliver is then homophobic towards Scott as a result by calling him a puff and then runs away. He attempts to speak to Luke again but finds him drinking in the restaurant with best mate Darren Osbourne instead though which results in Oliver crying his eyes out when he see's Luke and him drinking together in the Hutch restaurant and witness's this from outside with Luke not realising that his own son saw him drinking once again. Buster lies to Oliver by telling him that Scott has agreed to let Oliver be the poster boy for the Bean. Buster takes several intimate photographs of Oliver when they're alone together at the football academy changing rooms which he later confesses to Luke. As Luke is drunk at the time though, Oliver makes him promise to wait until he is sober before confronting Buster. The next morning though however, Luke cannot remember anything at all about what Oliver was saying to him causing Oliver to angrily confront him and reveal to him that he knows that Luke was raped years ago. Luke then explains to Oliver that he began drinking as a way to cope with the abuse that he suffered back then. Buster later convinces Oliver that telling Luke anything will put unnecessary pressure on his dad and tells him that his dad is an alcoholic and people like him only care about where the next drink is going to come from and that they're too distracted to think about their loved ones instead as well so Oliver agrees to keep quiet but later steals a bottle of wine though and begins drinking in secret in order to cope with everything that's happened. Brody later convinces Oliver to report Buster to the police and he is arrested. Buster pleads not guilty at the hearing and Oliver lashes out at Brooke, but soon apologises to her.\n\nOliver is disgusted when the truth about Imran is revealed. Him and Brooke get closer but Brooke is told by Nancy that she could not be friends with him, but eventually they become friends again. During Buster's trial, Oliver is ripped to pieces by Buster's defence team and because of this, he agrees that Brooke would not be able to cope giving evidence. Imran reveals that Buster attempted to sexually assault him in Barcelona, shocking everybody. Buster is found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison. Oliver and Brooke begin dating after almost sharing a kiss. Brooke becomes pregnant and whilst Oliver is excited, Brooke doesn\u2019t feel ready so they arrange for the baby\u2019s adoption. Brooke later gives birth to a son, Thierry.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Buster Smith==\n{{infobox soap character \n|series = Hollyoaks\n|name = Buster Smith\n|portrayer = Nathan Sussex\n|years = 2018\u20132019\n|first = 29 January 2018\n|last = 11 January 2019\n|introducer = [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]]\n|classification = [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2019|Former; regular]]\n|sons = [[Damon Kinsella]]\n|wife = [[Maggie Kinsella]] (backstory)\n}}\n'''Buster Smith''', played by Nathan Sussex, made his first screen appearance on 29 January 2018.<ref name=\"Damon father\"/> The character and Sussex's casting details were announced on 23 January 2018.<ref name=\"Damon father\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a848131/hollyoaks-spoilers-damon-kinsella-dad-buster/|title=Hollyoaks reveals new family tensions as Damon Kinsella's father Buster arrives|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=23 January 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref> Buster is the father of [[Damon Kinsella]] (Jacob Roberts) and arrives following the death of his former wife and Damon's mother, [[Maggie Kinsella]] ([[Michelle Holmes]]).<ref name=\"Buster\"/> Buster is described as \"quite a charming character\", who gets along with everyone.

Maggie had thrown Buster out after his numerous affairs and he missed out on most of Damon's life. Damon's girlfriend, [[Holly Cunningham]] ([[Amanda Clapham]]), convinces Damon to give his father a chance and they agree to re-build their father-son relationship. Damon's longtime best friend, Brody, is not happy to see Buster and it's clear that there is bad blood between them. Buster begins dating [[Marnie Nightingale]] ([[Lysette Anthony]]) and moves into the flat above [[The Dog in the Pond]] [[public house]] with her, her children [[Alfie Nightingale|Alfie]] (Richard Linnell) and [[Ellie Nightingale|Ellie]] ([[Sophie Porley]]), as well as Damon and Brody.\n\nBuster decides to set up his own football academy for teenagers. Many local kids, including Oliver and [[Imran Maalik]] (Ijaz Rana), sign up. Oliver confides in Buster about how difficult his home life is due to his father, [[Luke Morgan]] ([[Gary Lucy]]), having a drinking problem and constantly arguing with his wife, [[Mandy Richardson|Mandy]] ([[Sarah Jayne Dunn]]). Buster tells Oliver he can trust him with anything. Brody confides in Oliver's mother, [[#Scarlett Morgan|Scarlett Morgan]] ([[Susie Amy]]), that someone he trusted abused him when he was young and it is obvious he is referring to Buster. It becomes clear then that Buster is not just being friendly to Oliver \u2014 he is grooming him so he can sexually abuse him.\n\nAs part of his grooming, Buster gives Oliver special attention and makes him team captain. One day, Buster is giving Oliver a sports massage and sexually abuses him for the first time. Oliver is upset after the incident, but Buster convinces him that he misinterpreted what happened. Buster abuses Oliver again under the guise of a massage, which causes Oliver to quit the team. Buster convinces Oliver to rejoin the team and continues to abuse him. Buster has Oliver pose for photos without his clothes on. Luke discovers the photos and when he asks Oliver about them, he points the finger at Scott. Brody suspects Buster is the real culprit and confronts him about abusing him as a child. It comes out that Maggie found out about Buster abusing Brody and that is actually why she threw him out. Oliver tells the police it was actually Buster who abused him and he is arrested. In January 2019, Buster was found guilty, he was sentenced six years in prison for abusing Oliver.\n\n==Theo Jones==\n{{infobox soap character \n|series = Hollyoaks\n|name = Theo Jones\n|portrayer = [[Matt Kennard]]\n|first = {{start date|2018|4|13|df=y}}\n|last = {{end date|2018|5|15|df=y}}\n|introducer = [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]]\n|classification = [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2018|Former; guest]]\n|brothers = [[Milo Entwistle]]\n}}\n'''Theo Jones''', played by [[Matt Kennard]], made his first on-screen appearance on 13 April 2018.<ref name=\"Theo casting\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a854064/hollyoaks-spoilers-milo-entwistle-theo-blackmail/|title=Hollyoaks' Milo Entwistle to be blackmailed by mystery newcomer Theo|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=6 April 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> The character was announced on 3 April 2018,<ref name=\"Theo\"/> while the casting details were confirmed on 6 April 2018.<ref name=\"Theo casting\"/> It was initially reported that Theo has a connection to established character, [[Milo Entwistle]] (Nathan Morris).<ref name=\"Theo\"/> On 10 April 2018, it was confirmed that Theo and Milo are brothers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Hollyoaks teases Sienna's stalker reveal, Mac's return and more huge spoilers in new trailer|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a854393/hollyoaks-spoilers-siennas-stalker-reveal-macs-return-trailer/|accessdate=13 April 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=10 April 2018}}</ref> Kennard describes Theo as a bad character, calling him \"a bitter, seemingly irredeemable bully.\"<ref name=\"Theo casting\"/> He stated that Theo is a [[Male promiscuity|womaniser]] who only cares about himself.

On her character, Brady commented that she was a \"strong and colourful individual\" and that she didn't have \"a lot of fear for authority.\" Brady also said that \"Breda comes from the firm but fair school of motherhood,\" and described her as a \"tigress.\" With Sylver having been in prison, Breda kept tabs on him, but Brady said that Breda doesn't have a favourite child and that as her character becomes more settled in the village, her love for Goldie would shine through.<ref name=\"Breda\"/>\n\nArriving in Hollyoaks to stay with the McQueens', Breda began working as a nanny for [[Leela Lomax]] ([[Kirsty-Leigh Porter]]) \u2013 but secretly agreed to \"two time\" Leela by working for [[Jack Osborne]] ([[Jimmy McKenna]]) too. Jack tried to cover for Breda by pretending they were in a relationship \u2013 much to Leela's amusement. Leela figured it out and allowed Breda to be nanny to both her and Jack. Eventually, Breda's friendship with Jack would turn into a real relationship.\n\nOn [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) and [[Russ Owen]]'s ([[Stuart Manning]]) wedding day in November 2018, it was shockingly revealed that Breda was a serial killer. Breda discovered that Russ had been unfaithful with Goldie, resulting in a pregnancy, and had pressurised her into aborting their child. Enraged, Breda murdered Russ. She was then revealed to have killed [[Glenn Donovan]] (Bob Cryer) and [[Carl Costello]] ([[Paul Opacic]]) for being \"sinners\" and \"dead beat dads\".

Breda moved Louis to an old pig farm once owned by her parents making out she was caring for him and took him there to recover, Louis discovered Breda was responsible for the deaths of Carl, Glenn and Russ whilst writing a letter to Simone and attempted to escape but was thwarted when Breda returned to the farm. She puts him back into bed and believes him when he says it's Leela he wants to be with, Breda makes tea and as she strips the bed Louis switches the cups which Breda notices, just then Simone arrives at the farm calling for Breda, before Louis can react Breda smothers him keeping him from shouting to Simone. Breda goes to Simone and gets a lift to the village, meanwhile, Louis escapes and Breda finds him hiding in the barn. She says she's going to make some tea but then spots the letter confessing to the murders that Louis found. Louis begs for his life but Breda kills him by bludgeoning him with a telephone. She returns to Leela telling her to move on. Later at the farm Breda burns Louis' clothes and mobile phone in a metal canister. When she leaves a mysterious hooded figure takes Louis's phone and removes the sim card. The hooded figure is later revealed as [[Mac Nightingale]] ([[David Easter]]), who begins to blackmail Breda. He orders her to murder his son [[James Nightingale (Hollyoaks)|James Nightingale]] ([[Gregory Finnegan]]), much to her reluctance. Eventually, she slips poison into his coffee, and James collapses on a park bench. She later bakes a lasagne, which Mac eats in celebration, but is stunned to realise Breda has poisoned that, too. She reveals James will be fine, and she always intended to kill Mac, who in a weakened state tries to attack her but she kills him by hitting him with the lasagne dish. In July 2019, it is revealed that it was Breda who killed Vinnie, not Sylver, as he survived the fall, but Breda finished him off, and let Sylver take the blame. Later in the month, Breda planned to kill [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]) after he confessed his past mistakes to her but Breda did not kill him, after learning [[Harry Thompson (Hollyoaks)|Harry Thompson]] ([[Parry Glasspool]]) was going on the run. Breda fatally stabs Harry in an alleyway believing he was a bad dad for abandoning his son Isaac. Harry then died as a result of his injuries. Tony later discovers that Breda killed his son and she stabs Tony in the stomach.

Goldie learns she's going to the pig farm and Breda lies that she is mentally ill. Breda pretends to have dementia, but when Goldie finds her at the pig farm again, Breda confesses to killing Harry. She blames it on her \"dementia\" and Goldie agrees to keep it a secret. Breda's killing spree comes to an end when Sylver, Goldie and Mercedes and [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) all find out her serial killer secret. Mercedes finds Tony at the pig farm but Breda sneaks up and attacks her, after stabbing Tony again and locking Mercedes in the cage too, which she and Tony eventually escape from. After a heated confrontation in the house, Breda shoots Sylver with a bolt gun and sets the pig farm on fire.

{"title_page": "Road signs in New Zealand", "text_new": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

language|M\u0101ori]]: '''''Waka Kotahi''''') uses a [[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

language|M\u0101ori]]: '''''Waka Kotahi''''') uses a [[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Fry1989", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:New Zealand RG-12.svg\u2192File:New Zealand road sign R3-8.svgFile name standardisation.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_New_Zealand"}

The treaty was a reaction of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] provinces to the 1579 [[Union of Arras]] (Dutch: ''Unie van Atrecht''), in which the southern provinces declared their support for [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Spain.\n\nDuring the following months of 1579, other states signed the treaty as well, such as [[Ghent]], cities from [[Friesland]], as well as three of the quarters of [[Guelders]] ([[Nijmegen Quarter]], [[Veluwe Quarter]], [[Zutphen County]]). In the summer of 1579, [[Amersfoort]] from the province of Utrecht also joined, together with [[Ypres]], [[Antwerp]], [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]] and [[Brussels]]. In February 1580, [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]], [[Bruges]] and the surrounding area also signed the Union. The city of [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] shifted in favor under influence of the [[stadtholder]] for Friesland, [[George van Rennenberg]], and also signed the treaty.
