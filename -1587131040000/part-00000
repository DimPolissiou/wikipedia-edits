Under Lumumba's deputy, Antoine Gizenga, leftists organised in [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] (modern-day Kisangani) and in December declared their own government to be the legal successor to the prime minister's administration. Gizenga quickly amassed military strength and, by February 1961, had occupied vast portions of Congolese territory. In August, negotiations between the two governments resulted in Gizenga agreeing to stand down. He returned to the office of deputy under the new prime minister, [[Cyrille Adoula]]. Still, Gizenga distanced himself from the central administration and rebuilt his own political and military power. The rival government wasnot fully reintegrated into the Republic of the Congo until Gizenga was arrested in January 1962.\n\n== Background ==\nOn 30 June 1960, the [[Belgian Congo]] became independent as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]]. However, the domestic situation quickly devolved as the army mutinied, beginning the [[Congo Crisis]]. In spite of Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]]'s efforts to calm the troops, the situation worsened. [[State of Katanga|Katanga]] and [[South Kasai]] subsequently seceded from the central government. The [[United Nations]] (UN) organised [[United Nations Operation in the Congo|a peacekeeping operation]] and sent troops to the Congo. On 5 September, President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] dismissed Lumumba from his post. The government was paralyzed by the political battle that ensued, and on 14 September, Colonel [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] announced a takeover in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] (modern-day Kinshasa) and the installation of his own administration.<ref name= \"young325\u2013329\">{{harvnb|Young|1965|pp=325\u2013329}}</ref> Two days later, Lumumba was placed under house arrest.

Several provincial deputies were also taken to Stanleyville. At dawn, on 1 January 1961, central government troops advised by the Belgians entered Bukavu from [[Ruanda-Urundi|Ruanda]] and occupied the Saio military camp. Stanleyville forces subsequently intervened, capturing 40 soldiers and ejecting the expedition back into Ruanda. Both sides continued to exchange fire over the border throughout the afternoon.<ref name= nelson104>{{harvnb|Nelson|1992|p=104}}</ref> The following day, Anicet Kashamura arrived to take over the Kivu provincial administration.<ref name= young331/> The situation in [[South Kivu|southern Kivu]] became chaotic in the following months; Europeans were robbed, beaten, and harassed, with many choosing to flee the area, while over 200 Congolese were killed.

Gizenga's authority was also established over the [[Sankuru]] District of [[Kasai region|Kasai]] Province.<ref name= young331/> Around then, control had been consolidated in [[Goma]] and the [[North Kivu|northern Kivu]] region. All local political prisoners were released. Fear of another Belgian-supported invasion from Ruanda led to an exchange of fire on 12 January over the border between Goma and [[Gisenyi]].<ref name= nelson105>{{harvnb|Nelson|1992|p=105}}</ref> The rival government reached its greatest territorial extent on 24 February when some of its forces briefly earned the allegiance of the [[Kananga|Luluabourg]] garrison.<ref name= young331>{{harvnb|Young|1965|p=331}}</ref>\n\nAlso in February, seven Lumumba supporters including Orientale Provincial President [[Jean-Pierre Finant]], were tried by a \"traditional court\" of [[Luba people|Baluba]] chiefs near [[Bakwanga]] and were executed for committing \"crimes against the Baluba nation\". In retaliation, Free Republic of the Congo authorities shot 15 political prisoners in Stanleyville, including [[Gilbert Pongo]], one of the military officers who captured Lumumba, and Lumumba's minister of communications, [[Alphonse Songolo]].<ref name= othen/><ref name= young331/> Songolo had broken with Lumumba's stance in mid-October and traveled to Stanleyville with several colleagues to try to garner support against him until he was arrested. The central government had unsuccessfully tried to secure his release.<ref name= kalb161>{{harvnb|Kalb|1982|p=161}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 January 1961, discipline in Thysville faltered and the central government transferred Lumumba to [[\u00c9lisabethville]], the capital of Katanga. Once there, he was brutally tortured at the hands of [[Mo\u00efse Tshombe]] and [[Godefroid Munongo]], his chief political rivals and the leaders of the secessionist state.{{sfn|Gondola|2002|pp=126\u2013127}} That night he was executed by a Belgo-Katangese firing squad.{{sfn|de Witte|2002|p=120}} When news of Lumumba's death broke in February, 3,000\u20134,000 angry soldiers gathered in the European quarter of Stanleyville to enact revenge upon the local residents.

'''Congo-Stanleyville''', was a short-lived rival government to the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] (Congo-L\u00e9opoldville) based in the eastern Congo and led by [[Antoine Gizenga]]. \n\nFollowing Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]]'s deposition in September 1960 in the midst of the [[Congo Crisis]], many of his supporters became disillusioned with the government in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] (modern-day Kinshasa). Under Lumumba's deputy, Antoine Gizenga, leftists organised in [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] (modern-day Kisangani) and in December declared their own government to be the legal successor to the prime minister's administration. Gizenga quickly amassed military strength and, by February 1961, had occupied vast portions of Congolese territory. In August, negotiations between the two governments resulted in Gizenga agreeing to stand down. He returned to the office of deputy under the new prime minister, [[Cyrille Adoula]]. Still, Gizenga distanced himself from the central administration and rebuilt his own political and military power. The rival government wasn't fully reintegrated into the Republic of the Congo until Gizenga was arrested in January 1962.\n\n== Background ==\nOn 30 June 1960, the [[Belgian Congo]] became independent as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]]. However, the domestic situation quickly devolved as the army mutinied, beginning the [[Congo Crisis]]. In spite of Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]]'s efforts to calm the troops, the situation worsened. [[State of Katanga|Katanga]] and [[South Kasai]] subsequently seceded from the central government. The [[United Nations]] (UN) organised [[United Nations Operation in the Congo|a peacekeeping operation]] and sent troops to the Congo. On 5 September, President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] dismissed Lumumba from his post. The government was paralyzed by the political battle that ensued, and on 14 September, Colonel [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] announced a takeover in [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] (modern-day Kinshasa) and the installation of his own administration.<ref name= \"young325\u2013329\">{{harvnb|Young|1965|pp=325\u2013329}}</ref> Two days later, Lumumba was placed under house arrest.

During the battle the Dutch frigate ''Maria Riggersbergen'' was left unsupported by the remainder of the squadron and, isolated, was forced to surrender.{{notetag|name=fn1}} Captain Peter Rainier, the British commander, was subsequently free to remove his prize from within sight of the Dutch port when the remainder of the Dutch squadron refused to engage ''Caroline'' and their crews deliberately grounded the ships to avoid capture. He also returned many prisoners taken previously in a captured brig.\n\nThe action, and that of with the earlier [[Action of 26 July 1806]], demonstrated the weakness of the Dutch squadron in the East Indies and convinced Rear-Admiral [[Edward Pellew|Sir Edward Pellew]] to lead an operation against Batavia to eliminate the remainder of the Dutch squadron in November 1806. This second raid was only partially successful, and was followed a year later by a raid on the harbour of [[Gresik|Griessie]], in which the last Dutch warships in the East were eliminated.\n\n==Background==\nBy 1806, the [[Linois' expedition to the Indian Ocean|French squadron]] under Rear-Admiral [[Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois|Charles Linois]] departed for the Atlantic Ocean and a British expeditionary force captured the [[Cape of Good Hope]].<ref name=\"RG81\"/> Rear-Admiral [[Edward Pellew|Sir Edward Pellew]], commander of the British [[Royal Navy]] in the eastern half of the Indian Ocean at [[Madras]] in [[British India]] in the eastern half of the Indian Ocean was now able to concentrate on a major threat to British shipping in the region; the Dutch squadron based in the [[Dutch East Indies]], specifically on [[Java]] at the port of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]].<ref name=\"RG81\"/>\n\nThe Dutch squadron, which consisted of a number of old [[ships of the line]], three [[frigate]]s and a number of smaller warships, was primarily an anti-piracy force. However, their presence so close to the [[Straits of Malacca]], a major British trade route, was of concern to Pellew, particularly following the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]] in 1804, when Linois<nowiki>'</nowiki>s squadron intercepted a vital British convoy in the Strait, using Batavia both as a base to launch the operation and repair damage afterwards.<ref name=\"WLC336\">Clowes, p. 336</ref> Determined to eliminate the Dutch squadron, Pellew despatched frigates to the region in the spring of 1806, under orders to disrupt trade and reconnoitre the Dutch harbours and bases. In July 1806, the frigate HMS ''Greyhound'' cruised the [[Molucca Islands]], and captured a Dutch frigate and convoy at the [[Action of 26 July 1806]] off [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], encouraging further expeditions.<ref name=\"WJ252\">James, p. 252</ref> In October 1806, a second frigate, the 36-gun HMS ''Caroline'' under Captain Peter Rainier (nephew of Admiral [[Peter Rainier, junior|Peter Rainier]] whom Pellew had replaced), cruised in the [[Java Sea]]. ''Caroline'' had a successful start to the operation, discovering that the Dutch ships of the line had left Batavia harbour and sailed eastwards.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> He had also captured a number of Dutch ships so that by mid-October 57 of Rainier's crew, more than a fifth, were aboard prizes on the journey back to India, leaving ''Caroline'' with just 204 men and a large number of prisoners carried below decks.<ref name=\"JH79\">Henderson, p. 79</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nOn 18 October, Rainier was cruising in the Java Sea when he encountered and captured a small Dutch [[brig]] sailing from [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]]. From prisoners removed from this ship, Rainier learned that the Dutch frigate [[Dutch frigate Phoenix|''Phoenix'']] was undergoing repairs at the small island of Onrust in the [[Thousand Islands (Indonesia)|Thousand Islands]].<ref name=\"WLC392\"/> Deciding that ''Phoenix'' was lying in an exposed position and could be easily attacked, Rainier sailed ''Caroline'' towards Onrust, but was spotted in the passage between Middlebey and Amsterdam Islands by two small Dutch warships. Rainier attacked the small vessels, seizing the 14-gun brig ''Zeerop'' without a shot fired. The other vessel ''Zee-Ploeg'' escaped into shallow coastal waters, where the deeper drafted frigate could not follow.  The delay allowed ''Phoenix'' to sail to Batavia ahead of ''Caroline''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s pursuit.<ref name=\"LG1\"/>\n\nAs ''Caroline'' neared Batavia, ''Phoenix'' entered the well-defended harbour, making further pursuit impossible. However, Rainier then sighted a second frigate, lying at anchor in Batavia Roads, accompanied only by the 14-gun [[corvette]] ''William'', the elusive brig ''Zee-Ploeg'', and the 18-gun ship ''Patriot'' that belonged to the [[Dutch East India Company]].<ref name=\"LG1\"/> Prisoners from ''Zeerop'' identified this ship as the 36-gun [[Dutch frigate Maria Riggersbergen|''Maria Riggersbergen'']] under Captain Claas Jager. Although this force was significantly stronger than ''Caroline'', and could call on the support of approximately 30&nbsp; gunboats anchored closer inshore, Rainier immediately gave orders to advance on the Dutch frigate. In his preparations for battle, Rainier ordered that springs be placed on his anchor cables, giving his ship the ability to easily turn at anchor to face new threats once engaged with the ''Maria Riggersbergen''.<ref name=\"WJ266\">James, p. 266</ref>\n\nAs ''Caroline'' approached, Captain Jager ordered his men to open fire on the British frigate at extreme range, also calling on support from the other Dutch vessels anchored nearby. In response, Rainier gave orders for his men to hold fire, enduring the Dutch guns until his frigate was just {{convert|40|yd|m}} away before unleashing a full [[broadside]].<ref name=\"JH79\"/> Jager responded, but the British fire was too strong and within half an hour the Dutch flag was [[striking the flag|struck]]. Taking possession of the Dutch frigate, Lieutenant Lemage discovered that 50&nbsp;of the 270&nbsp;men aboard had been killed or wounded and that the ship had suffered moderate damage to its masts and rigging.<ref name=\"WJ267\">James, p. 267</ref> British casualties in the engagement were three killed outright and eighteen more wounded, six of whom subsequently died. Also killed were four Dutch prisoners who had been sheltering in the hold.<ref name=\"LG2\"/>\n\nWhile Lemage was boarding ''Maria Riggersbergen'', Rainier had turned his attention to the other ships in the bay. However the sea was shallow and crossed by shoals that prevented further advance without proper charts, which ''Caroline'' lacked. Although they had fired a number of shots at long range, the interference by the smaller Dutch vessels during the battle had been negligible.<ref name=\"RG81\"/> Following the surrender of ''Maria Riggersbergen'', most of the shipping in the bay including all seven of the merchant vessels, the three small warships and ''Phoenix'', had deliberately beached themselves to avoid capture. Abandoning the idea of further operations off Batavia as too risky, Rainier ordered his ships to sail, placing most of the Dutch prisoners, including the wounded and sick, into the first brig captured that morning and ordering the ship to return to Batavia as a [[cartel (ship)|cartel]], with the officers placed under parole restrictions. With most of his prisoners removed, Rainier then ordered ''Maria Riggersbergen'' and ''Zeerop'' to return to [[Madras]].<ref name=\"LG2\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nRanier's action against what appeared to be superior power and numbers exposed the poor quality of the Dutch squadron at Batavia.  Pellew determined to make a decisive attack on the capital of the Dutch East Indies during 1806. In November he led a [[Raid on Batavia (1806)|powerful squadron to the harbour]], once again forcing the Dutch to their squadron ashore, where it was burnt by boarding parties led by Admiral Pellew's son, Captain [[Fleetwood Pellew]].<ref name=\"RG82\">Gardiner, p. 82</ref> The following year, Admiral Pellew returned in search of the missing ships of the line, [[Raid on Griessie|discovering them at]] [[Gresik|Griessie]] and causing the Dutch to destroy them too. With the Dutch squadron eliminated, the threat to British trade routes was removed and attention returned to the French bases in the Indian Ocean, the British waiting until 1811 to force the surrender of the remaining Dutch colonies in the East Indies.<ref name=\"RG107\">Gardiner, p. 107</ref>\n\n''Maria Riggersbergen'' was recommissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Java'', under Captain George Pigot. In his report after the battle, Rainier described the Dutch frigate as \"launched in 1800 and is a fast sailing ship\".<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=16139|page=568|date=23 April 1808}}</ref> The {{convert|2500|nmi|km}} journey to Madras had revealed that she was in fact much older and very unstable at sea.

The screenplay was written by Nicole Taylor.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 8 September 2018 and was released on 12 April 2019, by [[Entertainment One]] in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film received positive reviews, with Buckley earning a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] nomination for her performance.\n\n==Plot==\n\nRose-Lynn Harlan, an aspiring country singer and single mother of two from [[Glasgow]], is released after a year in prison for attempted drug smuggling after throwing a package of [[heroin]] over the wall into [[HM Prison Cornton Vale]] despite claiming that she did not know what was in the package. She learns that she has lost her longstanding job in the house band at Glasgow's Grand Ole Opry, as the manager refuses to employ a convicted criminal. Rose-Lynn's mother, Marion, who has been caring for Rose-Lynn's young children, encourages her to give up her music dream to focus on more practical careers and taking care of her family.\n\nRose-Lynn takes a cleaning job for Susannah's large house. Susannah's children overhear Rose-Lynn singing while she is cleaning and inform their mother, who confides that she is also a country music fan. Rose-Lynn asks Susannah for money to travel to [[Nashville]] and try to make it as a musician, but Susannah declines. However, she does get in contact with [[BBC Radio]] presenter, [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]], and sends him a recording of Rose-Lynn's singing; he offers to meet with her if she will come to London. Rose-Lynn appears before a judge to ask him to lift her [[probation|probationary]] 7pm to 7am curfew so she can travel, and he agrees. She travels by train to London and sits in on a live performance by the visiting [[Ashley McBryde]]. Harris encourages her to keep performing and figure out what she has to say so she can start writing her own songs.\n\nSusannah offers Rose-Lynn a performing gig at her upcoming house party, where she intends to ask her guests to contribute to Rose-Lynn's Nashville fund in lieu of gifts. Rose-Lynn asks Marion to watch the children in the week leading up to the party so she can rehearse, but Marion declines to cancel her holiday plans, so she is forced to shuttle her kids around to various friends who agree to watch them. The day before the performance, Susannah's husband gets Rose-Lynn alone and tells her he knows about her criminal conviction and she is to stop working for them after her performance.\n\nRose-Lynn's son breaks his arm while playing unattended at home, and the doctors at the hospital say they cannot put a cast on until after Rose-Lynn's planned performance. Marion arrives to help and Rose-Lynn begs her to stay and watch her son so she can get to the party; Marion agrees but criticises her strongly for neglecting her family. Rose-Lynn rushes to the party to perform but, once on stage, breaks down immediately. She confesses to Susannah her guilt for her criminal behaviour and not being there for her children, and her belief that her conviction and having children at a young age are permanent barriers to her musical dream, then leaves the party.\n\nRose-Lynn instead gets a job as a waitress and dedicates herself to her kids. Some time later, Marion, having seen that Rose-Lynn has accepted her responsibilities, presents her with a large sum of money she has saved, enough for her to travel to Nashville. Rose-Lynn tries to reject the money, but Marion expresses her regret about failing to accomplish her goals due to having kids. Rose-Lynn travels to Nashville and discovers how difficult it is to find gigs and get noticed. She sneaks on stage at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] during a backstage tour and sings an impromptu song to the empty building. A security guard approaches her afterward and offers to introduce her to a record producer, but Rose-Lynn decides to return to Glasgow, having realised that her future lies in her home town.\n\nOne year later, Rose-Lynn performs an original song at [[Celtic Connections]] titled \u201cGlasgow (No Place Like Home)\u201d and receives raucous applause.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jessie Buckley]] as Rose-Lynn Harlan\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Marion\n* [[Sophie Okonedo]] as Susannah \n* [[Jamie Sives]] as Sam\n* [[Craig Parkinson]] as Alan\n* James Harkness as Elliot\n* [[Janey Godley]] as Barmaid\n* Daisy Littlefeld as Wynonna\n* Adam Mitchell as Lyle\n* Ryan Kerr as Rory \n* Nicole Kerr as Nell\n}}\nThe film also features cameo appearances from [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Ashley McBryde]] and [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hallam |first1=Neil |title=Wild Rose Film Review - February 2019 |url=https://sixshootercountry.com/2019/02/25/wild-rose-movie-review/ |website=Six Shooter Country |accessdate=19 April 2019 |date=25 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Jessie Buckley, Tom Harper, and Nicole Taylor on Collider Video.jpg|right|thumb|(L-R) Nicole Taylor, Tom Harper, and Jessie Buckley discuss the film in 2018]]\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 8 September 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tiff.net/tiff/wild-rose/|title=Wild Rose|website=[[Toronto International Film Festival]]|accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref> Shortly after, [[Neon (distributor)|NEON]] acquired [[film distribution|distribution]] rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/markets-festivals/toronto-neon-nabs-wild-rose-1202934253/|title=Toronto: Neon Nabs \u2018Wild Rose\u2019|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Brent|last=Lang|date=9 September 2018|accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref> It  screened at the [[BFI London Film Festival]] on 15 October 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=wildrose&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=|title=Wild Rose|website=[[BFI Film Festival]]|accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref> and   at [[South by Southwest]] in March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/olivia-wilde-seth-rogen-matthew-mcconaughey-added-sxsw-film-fest-lineup-1176656|title=SXSW: Olivia Wilde, Seth Rogen, Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey to Premiere New Work|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Gregg|last=Kilday|date=January 16, 2019|accessdate=January 30, 2019}}</ref> It was released in the United Kingdom on 12 April 2019, by [[Entertainment One]] and in the United States on 21 June 2019 by [[Neon (distributor)|NEON]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.firstshowing.net/2019/first-uk-trailer-for-country-singer-film-wild-rose-starring-jessie-buckley/|title=UK Trailer for Country Singer Film 'Wild Rose' Starring Jessie Buckley|website=First Showing|first=Alex|last=Billington|date=January 23, 2019|accessdate=January 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2019/04/01/the-wild-rose-trailer-wants-to-pull-your-heartstrings|title=The WILD ROSE Trailer Wants To Pull Your Heartstrings|website=birthmoviesdeath.com|first=Evan|last=Saathoff|date=1 April 2019|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Wild Rose (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Jessie Buckley]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = April 12, 2019\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = {{hlist|[[Soundtrack]]|[[country music|Country]]}}\n| length     = \n| label      = \n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = Wild Rose (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Country Girl (Primal Scream song)|Country Girl]]\n}}\n}}\nThe soundtrack features both original songs written exclusively for the film and covers of songs by established country artists such as [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Wynonna Judd]], [[Chris Stapleton]], [[Hank Snow]], folk artists [[John Prine]] and [[Patty Griffin]] as well as indie rock band [[Primal Scream]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2019/02/22/wild-rose-soundtrack-details/|title=\u2018Wild Rose\u2019 Soundtrack Details - Film Music Reporter|publisher=}}</ref> All songs are performed by singer [[Jessie Buckley]] with the exception of tracks 17, 18 and 19 (which are performed by The Bluegrass Smugglers) and track 20 (which is performed by Hillary Klug).
