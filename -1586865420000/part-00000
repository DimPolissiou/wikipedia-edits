After few other significant events in the rest of January, a deadly period took place in the latter part of the winter. Two deadly outbreaks and several other major tornado events marred February and March, especially in the southern US.\n\nThe spring was also fairly active, with several significant tornado events in April and May, including a major outbreak in the first weekend of May producing the first ever EF5 tornado (and first F5 tornado on any scale in the 21st century).

After few other significant events in the rest of January, a deadly period took place in the latter part of the winter. Two deadly outbreaks and several other major tornado events marred February and March, especially in the southern US.\n\nThe spring was also fairly active, with several significant tornado events in April and May, including a major outbreak in the first weekend of May producing the first ever EF5 tornado (and first F5 tornado on any scale in the 21st century). While June was not as active with fewer tornadoes, it produced another F5 tornado and Canada's first such confirmed tornado.\n\nThe tropics in the Western Hemisphere produced few significant tornadoes in 2007, but [[Typhoon Sepat (2007)|Typhoon Sepat]] produced a deadly tornado in China. Otherwise, the summer and early fall were fairly quiet, with a few local exceptions. The most severe outbreak in the second half of the year took place in October, when the largest outbreak ever recorded in that month took place.\n\nThe year ended slowly with no major outbreaks in November or December and only a few isolated tornadoes, mostly related to larger winter storms.\n\n==Events==\n{{Main|List of United States tornadoes in 2007|List of United States tornadoes from January to February 2007|List of United States tornadoes in March 2007}}\n\n===United States Yearly Total===\n{{Tornado Chart \n| Total=1,096\n| F0=674\n| F1=299\n| F2=91\n| F3=27\n| F4=4\n| F5=1\n| Enhanced=yes}}\n\n*Note: January tornadoes were rated using the old Fujita scale, but are included in the chart above by matching the F rating to the related EF scale rating.<ref name=2007count>{{cite web  | title = 2007 U.S. tornado count  | publisher = SPC  | year = 2007  | url = http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/2007_tornadoes.png  | accessdate = 2008-05-23}}</ref>\n\n==January==\n{{Main|List of United States tornadoes from January to February 2007}}\nThere were 29 tornadoes reported in the U.S. in January, of which 22 were confirmed.\n\n===January 4\u20135===\n{{Tornado chart small| F0 = 5| F1 = 8| F2 = 2| F3 = 0| F4 = 0| F5 = 0| Enhanced = }}\n\nThe first severe weather event of 2007 was a scattered but deadly tornado event in the [[U.S. Gulf Coast]] region on January 4.

A small area of EF4 damage was noted as the tornado exited at the northeast corner of town. An agricultural company, a construction company, and a car dealership were completely destroyed in this area. The construction company was entirely flattened, with steel beams twisted and thrown into nearby fields. A large metal storage tank that originated in this area was found 1.5 miles away in a corn field. Numerous vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from the car dealership, many of which were mangled beyond recognition. Farm fields in this area were heavily scoured, and mature corn stalks in one field were snapped at the base and flattened to the ground, with husked ears of corn found scattered about. EF1 damage was observed further to the northeast before the tornado dissipated.

In the mid-19th century, Korea closed its border to Western trade. In the [[General Sherman incident|''General Sherman'' incident]], which took place in 1866, Korean forces attacked a U.S. gunboat sent to negotiate a trade treaty and killed its crew, after fire from both sides because it defied instructions from Korean officials. A U.S. retribution attack, the [[United States expedition to Korea|Shinmiyangyo]], followed.\n\nKorea and the U.S. ultimately established trade relations in 1882. Relations soured again in 1905 when the U.S. negotiated peace at the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Japan persuaded the U.S. to accept Korea as part of Japan's [[sphere of influence]], and the United States did not protest when Japan annexed Korea five years later. Korean nationalists unsuccessfully petitioned the United States to support their cause at the [[Versailles Treaty]] conference under [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s principle of national self-determination.\n\n===Post\u2013World War II (1945\u20131948)===\n{{Further|Division of Korea|People's Republic of Korea|Moscow Conference (1945)}}\nThe [[United Nations]] divided Korea after World War II along the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], intending this as a temporary measure. However, the breakdown of relations between the U.S. and [[USSR]] prevented a reunification. During the U.S. army's occupation of South Korea, relations between the U.S. and North Korea were conducted through the Soviet military government in the North.{{citation needed |date=February 2018}} Because of North Korea's \"submission\" to Soviet pressures, and because of mass opposition to the U.S. occupation of the mortal enemy Japan, North Koreans in this period denounced the United States and began to form a negative view of the U.S. However, several American ministers and missionaries remained active in this period.\n\n===Cold War===\n====Pre-Korean War (1948\u20131950)====\nOn September 9, 1948, [[Kim Il-sung]] declared the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; he promptly received diplomatic recognition from the Soviet Union, but not the United States. The U.S. did not extend, and has never extended, diplomatic recognition to the DPRK. Kim Il-Sung's anti-American rhetoric often asserted that the U.S. was a capitalist [[imperialism|imperialist]] successor to Japan, a view the country still holds today. In December 1950, the United States initiated economic sanctions against the DPRK under the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917|Trading with the Enemy Act]],<ref>Harry S.

MacArthur planned to find North Korean generals, especially Kim Il-Sung, and try them as war criminals.\n\nPublic support in the United States to commit ground troops to Korea was at first, remarkably high. In June 1950, 78% of Americans said they approved of Truman's decision to send military aid, and 15% disapproved.

Bush]] announced his opposition to the Agreed Framework during his presidential candidacy. Following his inauguration in January 2001, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|new administration]] began a review of its policy toward North Korea. At the conclusion of that review, the administration announced on June 6, 2001, that it had decided to pursue continued dialogue with North Korea on the full range of issues of concern to the administration, including North Korea's conventional force posture, missile development and export programs, human rights practices, and humanitarian issues. As of that time, the Light Water Reactors (LWRs) promised in the [[Agreed Framework between the United States of America and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Agreed Framework]] had not been delivered.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lauren|first1=Paul|last2=Craig|first2=Gordon|last3=Page|first3=Alexander George|date=2007|title=Force and Statecraft: Diplomatic Challenges of Our Time|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> The two reactors were finally supplied by the Swiss-based company [[Adtranz|ABB]] in 2000 in a $200 million deal. The ABB contract was to deliver equipment and services for two nuclear power stations at [[Kumho, South Hamgyong|Kumho]], on North Korea's east coast. [[Donald Rumsfeld]], the US secretary of defense, was on the board of ABB when it won this deal, but a [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] spokeswoman, Victoria Clarke, said that Rumsfeld does not recall it being brought before the board at any time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Rumsfeld_was_on_ABB_board_during_deal_with_North_Korea.html?cid=3176922|title=Rumsfeld was on ABB board during deal with North Korea|date=February 24, 2003|publisher=Swissinfo.ch|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}</ref> Construction of these reactors was eventually suspended.\n\nIn 2002 the US Government announced that it would release $95m to North Korea as part of the Agreed Framework. In releasing the funding, President George W Bush waived the Framework's requirement that North Korea allow inspectors to ensure it has not hidden away any [[weapons-grade plutonium]] from the original reactors. President Bush argued that the decision was \"vital to the national security interests of the [[United States]]\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1908571.stm | work=BBC News | title=US grants N Korea nuclear funds | date=April 3, 2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the administration asserted that North Korea was developing a uranium enrichment program for nuclear weapons purposes. American-DPRK tensions mounted when Bush categorized North Korea as part of the \"[[Axis of evil|Axis of Evil]]\" in his 2002 [[State of the Union address]].\n\nWhen U.S.-DPRK direct dialogue resumed in October 2002, this uranium-enrichment program was high on the U.S. agenda. North Korean officials acknowledged to a U.S. delegation, headed by Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs [[James A. Kelly]], the existence of the uranium enrichment program. Such a program violated North Korea's obligations under the NPT and its commitments in the 1992 North-South Denuclearization Declaration and the 1994 Agreed Framework. The U.S. side stated that North Korea would have to terminate the program before any further progress could be made in U.S.-DPRK relations. The U.S. side also claimed that if this program was verifiably eliminated, the U.S. would be prepared to work with DPRK on the development of a fundamentally new relationship. In November 2002, the members of KEDO agreed to suspend heavy fuel oil shipments to North Korea pending a resolution of the nuclear dispute.\n\nFollowing [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|Kim Jong-il's death]] on December 17, 2011, his son [[Kim Jong-un]] inherited the regime. The latter announced on February 29, 2012, that North Korea will freeze nuclear tests, long-range missile launches, and uranium enrichment at its Yongbyon plant. In addition, the new leader invited international nuclear inspectors who were ejected in 2009. The [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] responded by offering 240,000 tonnes of food, chiefly in the form of biscuits. This indicated a softening of the west regarding North Korea's insistence that food aid must comprise grains.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Economist|date=March 3, 2012|title=North Korean nuclear progress: Leap of faith|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21549005}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2002 and early 2003, North Korea terminated the freeze on its existing plutonium-based nuclear facilities, expelled IAEA inspectors and removed seals and monitoring equipment, quit the NPT, and resumed reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium for weapons purposes. North Korea subsequently announced that it was taking these steps to provide itself with a deterrent force in the face of U.S. threats and the U.S.'s \"hostile policy\". Beginning in mid-2003, the North repeatedly claimed to have completed reprocessing of the spent fuel rods previously frozen at [[Nyongbyon|Yongbyon]] and lain cooperation with North Korea's neighbors, who have also expressed concern over the threat to regional stability and security they believe it poses. The Bush Administration's stated goal is the complete, verifiable, and irreversible elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons program. North Korea's neighbors have joined the United States in supporting a nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula. U.S. actions, however, had been much more hostile to normalized relations with North Korea, and the administration continued to suggest [[regime change]] as a primary goal. The Bush Administration had consistently resisted two-party talks with the DPRK. A September 2005 agreement took place only after the Chinese government threatened to publicly accuse the U.S. of refusal to engage in negotiations.\n\n===Six-party talks===\n{{Main|Six-party talks}}\nIn early 2003, multilateral talks were proposed to be held among the six most relevant parties aimed at reaching a settlement through diplomatic means. North Korea initially opposed such a process, maintaining that the nuclear dispute was purely a bilateral matter between themselves and the United States. However, under pressure from its neighbors and with the active involvement of [[People's Republic of China|China]], North Korea agreed to preliminary three-party talks with China and the United States in [[Beijing]] in April 2003.\n\nAfter this meeting, North Korea then agreed to [[six-party talks]], between the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, [[Japan]], and [[Russia]]. The first round of talks were held in August 2003, with subsequent rounds being held at regular intervals. After 13 months of freezing talks between the fifth round's first and second phases, North Korea returned to the talks. This behavior was in retaliation for the US's action of freezing offshore North Korean bank accounts in Macau. In early 2005, the US government told its East Asia allies that Pyongyang had exported nuclear material to [[Libya]]. This backfired when Asian allies discovered that the US government had concealed the involvement of [[Pakistan]]; a key U.S. ally was the weapon's middle man. In March 2005, [[Condoleezza Rice]] had to travel to East Asia in an effort to repair the damage.\n\nThe third phase of the fifth round of talks held on February 8, 2007, concluded with a landmark action-for-action agreement. Goodwill by all sides has led to the US unfreezing all of the North Korean assets on March 19, 2007.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Korea North: Energy Policy, Laws and Regulation Handbook|last=|first=|publisher=International Business Publication|year=|isbn=|location=Washington DC, USA|pages=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=lgZierjOjYIC&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=Korea+North:+Energy+Policy,+Laws+and+Regulation+Handbook&source=bl&ots=10SXAH6UDp&sig=YCZSLeO-ggGpvGk25PZMYu1AA_E&hl=ko&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx-emll7LbAhUHUrwKHcCbC7QQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&q=Korea%20North%3A%20Energy%20Policy%2C%20Laws%20and%20Regulation%20Handbook&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAs of October 11, 2008, North Korea has agreed to all U.S. nuclear inspection demands and the Bush Administration responded by removing North Korea from a terrorism blacklist despite the American government threatening to end negotiations.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/11/korea-usa-terrorism-blacklist US removes North Korea from terrorism blacklist]. Guardian. Retrieved on December 16, 2015.</ref>\n\n===Resurgence of hostilities===\nStarting in late August 2008, North Korea allegedly resumed its nuclear activities at the Yongbyon nuclear facility, apparently moving equipment and nuclear supplies back onto the facility grounds. Since then, North Korean activity at the facility has steadily increased, with North Korea threatening Yongbyon's possible reactivation.\n\nNorth Korea has argued that the U.S. has failed to fulfill its promises in the disarmament process, having not removed the country from its \"[[State Sponsors of Terrorism (U.S. list)|State Sponsors of Terrorism]]\" list or sent the promised aid to the country. The U.S. has recently stated that it will not remove the North from its list until it has affirmed that North Korea will push forward with its continued disarmament. North Korea has since barred IAEA inspectors from the Yongbyon site, and the South has claimed that the North is pushing for the manufacture of a nuclear warhead. The North has recently conducted tests on short-range missiles. The U.S. is encouraging the resumption of six-party talks.\n\n===Removal from terror list===\nOn October 11, 2008, the U.S. and North Korea secured an agreement in which North Korea agreed to resume disarmament of its nuclear program and once again allowed inspectors to conduct forensic tests of its available nuclear materials. The North also agreed to provide full details on its long-rumored uranium program.

In the mid-19th century, Korea closed its border to Western trade. In the [[General Sherman incident|''General Sherman'' incident]], which took place in 1866, Korean forces attacked a U.S. gunboat sent to negotiate a trade treaty and killed its crew, after fire from both sides because it defied instructions from Korean officials. A U.S. retribution attack, the [[United States expedition to Korea|Shinmiyangyo]], followed.\n\nKorea and the U.S. ultimately established trade relations in 1882. Relations soured again in 1905 when the U.S. negotiated peace at the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Japan persuaded the U.S. to accept Korea as part of Japan's [[sphere of influence]], and the United States did not protest when Japan annexed Korea five years later. Korean nationalists unsuccessfully petitioned the United States to support their cause at the [[Versailles Treaty]] conference under [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s principle of national self-determination.\n\n===Post\u2013World War II (1945\u20131948)===\n{{Further|Division of Korea|People's Republic of Korea|Moscow Conference (1945)}}\nThe [[United Nations]] divided Korea after World War II along the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], intending this as a temporary measure. However, the breakdown of relations between the U.S. and [[USSR]] prevented a reunification. During the U.S. army's occupation of South Korea, relations between the U.S. and North Korea were conducted through the Soviet military government in the North.{{citation needed |date=February 2018}} Because of North Korea's \"submission\" to Soviet pressures, and because of mass opposition to the U.S. occupation of the mortal enemy Japan, North Koreans in this period denounced the United States and began to form a negative view of the U.S. However, several American ministers and missionaries remained active in this period.\n\n===Cold War===\n====Pre-Korean War (1948\u20131950)====\nOn September 9, 1948, [[Kim Il-sung]] declared the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; he promptly received diplomatic recognition from the Soviet Union, but not the United States. The U.S. did not extend, and has never extended, diplomatic recognition to the DPRK. Kim Il-Sung's anti-American rhetoric often asserted that the U.S. was a capitalist [[imperialism|imperialist]] successor to Japan, a view the country still holds today. In December 1950, the United States initiated economic sanctions against the DPRK under the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917|Trading with the Enemy Act]],<ref>Harry S.

MacArthur planned to find North Korean generals, especially Kim Il-Sung, and try them as war criminals.\n\nPublic support in the United States to commit ground troops to Korea was at first, remarkably high. In June 1950, 78% of Americans said they approved of Truman's decision to send military aid, and 15% disapproved.

North Korea subsequently tried the two journalists amid international protests and found them guilty of the charges, and sentenced them to twelve years of hard labor. The U.S. criticized the act as a \"[[Show trial|sham trial]]\".\n\nThe ordeal was finally resolved on August 4, when former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] arrived in Pyongyang in what he described as a \"solely private mission\" to secure the release of the two American journalists. He reportedly forwarded a message to North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]] from then-[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]], but [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Robert Gibbs]] denied this claim. Clinton's discussions with Kim were reportedly on various issues regarding American-North Korean relations. On August 5, Kim issued a formal pardon to the two American journalists, who subsequently returned to [[Los Angeles]] with Clinton. The unannounced visit by Clinton was the first by a high-profile American official since 2000, and is reported to have drawn praise and understanding by the parties involved.\n\n====ROKS ''Cheonan'' sinking====\n{{Main|ROKS Cheonan sinking}}\nOn May 24, 2010, the United States set plans to participate in new military exercises with South Korea as a direct military response to the sinking of a South Korean warship by what officials called a North Korean torpedo.<ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/25/world/la-fg-korea-ship-20100525 U.S., South Korea plan military exercises], by Julian E.

[[Donald Rumsfeld]], the US secretary of defense, was on the board of ABB when it won this deal, but a [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] spokeswoman, Victoria Clarke, said that Rumsfeld does not recall it being brought before the board at any time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Rumsfeld_was_on_ABB_board_during_deal_with_North_Korea.html?cid=3176922|title=Rumsfeld was on ABB board during deal with North Korea|date=February 24, 2003|publisher=Swissinfo.ch|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}</ref> Construction of these reactors was eventually suspended.\n\nIn 2002 the US Government announced that it would release $95m to North Korea as part of the Agreed Framework. In releasing the funding, President George W Bush waived the Framework's requirement that North Korea allow inspectors to ensure it has not hidden away any [[weapons-grade plutonium]] from the original reactors. President Bush argued that the decision was \"vital to the national security interests of the [[United States]]\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1908571.stm | work=BBC News | title=US grants N Korea nuclear funds | date=April 3, 2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the administration asserted that North Korea was developing a uranium enrichment program for nuclear weapons purposes. American-DPRK tensions mounted when Bush categorized North Korea as part of the \"[[Axis of evil|Axis of Evil]]\" in his 2002 [[State of the Union address]].\n\nWhen U.S.-DPRK direct dialogue resumed in October 2002, this uranium-enrichment program was high on the U.S. agenda. North Korean officials acknowledged to a U.S. delegation, headed by Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs [[James A. Kelly]], the existence of the uranium enrichment program. Such a program violated North Korea's obligations under the NPT and its commitments in the 1992 North-South Denuclearization Declaration and the 1994 Agreed Framework. The U.S. side stated that North Korea would have to terminate the program before any further progress could be made in U.S.-DPRK relations. The U.S. side also claimed that if this program was verifiably eliminated, the U.S. would be prepared to work with DPRK on the development of a fundamentally new relationship. In November 2002, the members of KEDO agreed to suspend heavy fuel oil shipments to North Korea pending a resolution of the nuclear dispute.\n\nFollowing [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|Kim Jong-il's death]] on December 17, 2011, his son [[Kim Jong-un]] inherited the regime. The latter announced on February 29, 2012, that North Korea will freeze nuclear tests, long-range missile launches, and uranium enrichment at its Yongbyon plant. In addition, the new leader invited international nuclear inspectors who were ejected in 2009. The [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] responded by offering 240,000 tonnes of food, chiefly in the form of biscuits. This indicated a softening of the west regarding North Korea's insistence that food aid must comprise grains.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Economist|date=March 3, 2012|title=North Korean nuclear progress: Leap of faith|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21549005}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2002 and early 2003, North Korea terminated the freeze on its existing plutonium-based nuclear facilities, expelled IAEA inspectors and removed seals and monitoring equipment, quit the NPT, and resumed reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium for weapons purposes. North Korea subsequently announced that it was taking these steps to provide itself with a deterrent force in the face of U.S. threats and the U.S.'s \"hostile policy\". Beginning in mid-2003, the North repeatedly claimed to have completed reprocessing of the spent fuel rods previously frozen at [[Nyongbyon|Yongbyon]] and lain cooperation with North Korea's neighbors, who have also expressed concern over the threat to regional stability and security they believe it poses. The Bush Administration's stated goal is the complete, verifiable, and irreversible elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons program. North Korea's neighbors have joined the United States in supporting a nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula. U.S. actions, however, had been much more hostile to normalized relations with North Korea, and the administration continued to suggest [[regime change]] as a primary goal. The Bush Administration had consistently resisted two-party talks with the DPRK. A September 2005 agreement took place only after the Chinese government threatened to publicly accuse the U.S. of refusal to engage in negotiations.\n\n===Six-party talks===\n{{Main|Six-party talks}}\nIn early 2003, multilateral talks were proposed to be held among the six most relevant parties aimed at reaching a settlement through diplomatic means. North Korea initially opposed such a process, maintaining that the nuclear dispute was purely a bilateral matter between themselves and the United States. However, under pressure from its neighbors and with the active involvement of [[People's Republic of China|China]], North Korea agreed to preliminary three-party talks with China and the United States in [[Beijing]] in April 2003.\n\nAfter this meeting, North Korea then agreed to [[six-party talks]], between the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, [[Japan]], and [[Russia]]. The first round of talks were held in August 2003, with subsequent rounds being held at regular intervals. After 13 months of freezing talks between the fifth round's first and second phases, North Korea returned to the talks. This behavior was in retaliation for the US's action of freezing offshore North Korean bank accounts in Macau. In early 2005, the US government told its East Asia allies that Pyongyang had exported nuclear material to [[Libya]]. This backfired when Asian allies discovered that the US government had concealed the involvement of [[Pakistan]]; a key U.S. ally was the weapon's middle man. In March 2005, [[Condoleezza Rice]] had to travel to East Asia in an effort to repair the damage.\n\nThe third phase of the fifth round of talks held on February 8, 2007, concluded with a landmark action-for-action agreement. Goodwill by all sides has led to the US unfreezing all of the North Korean assets on March 19, 2007.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Korea North: Energy Policy, Laws and Regulation Handbook|last=|first=|publisher=International Business Publication|year=|isbn=|location=Washington DC, USA|pages=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=lgZierjOjYIC&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=Korea+North:+Energy+Policy,+Laws+and+Regulation+Handbook&source=bl&ots=10SXAH6UDp&sig=YCZSLeO-ggGpvGk25PZMYu1AA_E&hl=ko&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx-emll7LbAhUHUrwKHcCbC7QQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&q=Korea%20North%3A%20Energy%20Policy%2C%20Laws%20and%20Regulation%20Handbook&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAs of October 11, 2008, North Korea has agreed to all U.S. nuclear inspection demands and the Bush Administration responded by removing North Korea from a terrorism blacklist despite the American government threatening to end negotiations.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/11/korea-usa-terrorism-blacklist US removes North Korea from terrorism blacklist]. Guardian. Retrieved on December 16, 2015.</ref>\n\n===Resurgence of hostilities===\nStarting in late August 2008, North Korea allegedly resumed its nuclear activities at the Yongbyon nuclear facility, apparently moving equipment and nuclear supplies back onto the facility grounds. Since then, North Korean activity at the facility has steadily increased, with North Korea threatening Yongbyon's possible reactivation.\n\nNorth Korea has argued that the U.S. has failed to fulfill its promises in the disarmament process, having not removed the country from its \"[[State Sponsors of Terrorism (U.S. list)|State Sponsors of Terrorism]]\" list or sent the promised aid to the country. The U.S. has recently stated that it will not remove the North from its list until it has affirmed that North Korea will push forward with its continued disarmament. North Korea has since barred IAEA inspectors from the Yongbyon site, and the South has claimed that the North is pushing for the manufacture of a nuclear warhead. The North has recently conducted tests on short-range missiles. The U.S. is encouraging the resumption of six-party talks.\n\n===Removal from terror list===\nOn October 11, 2008, the U.S. and North Korea secured an agreement in which North Korea agreed to resume disarmament of its nuclear program and once again allowed inspectors to conduct forensic tests of its available nuclear materials. The North also agreed to provide full details on its long-rumored uranium program. These latest developments culminated in North Korea's long-awaited removal from America's \"State Sponsors of Terrorism\" list on the same day.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7665206.stm | work=BBC News | title=N Korea taken off US terror list | date=October 11, 2008 | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Nuclear tests===\n{{Main|List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea}}\n\n====2006====\n{{Main|2006 North Korean nuclear test}}\nU.S. intelligence agencies confirmed that a test occurred.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/world/AP-US-NKorea.html |title=U.S. Agencies Looking Into N.

The test was once again conducted underground and exploded with a yield comparable to the [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]] bombs that destroyed [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], respectively. The United States reacted favorably to China and Russia's reactions, who condemned North Korea's actions even though they are both strong allies of North Korea. The U.S., along with all other members of the stalled six-party talks, strongly condemned the test and said that North Korea would \"pay a price for its actions.\" The U.S. also strongly condemned the subsequent series of short-range missile tests that have followed the detonation.\n\n====2013====\n{{Main|2013 North Korean nuclear test}}\nOn January 24, 2013, officials in North Korea openly stated that they intended to plan out a third nuclear test.

The informant then ground washing soda to a fine powder and mixed it with water in a cup. He poured a small quantity of this on the kirar and rubbed the whole carefully together to a semfluid mass. Then the craftsman strained this mixture through a piece of linen into a large empty mussel shell, and the \"paint\" was ready. Ths paint was applied to a carnelian stone using a reed pen. The painted stone was then allowed to dry, first in the hand, then by placing it on a metal plate over a charcoal fire. When fully dry, the carnelian was covered with live coals and the fire fanned for about five minutes. The piece was then removed from the heat and allowed to cool slowly for about 10 minutes under an inverted cup, at which point the craftsman rubbed his piece of carnelian briskly with a rag and handed it over for inspection.

The informant then ground washing soda to a fine powder and mixed it with water in a cup. He poured a small quantity of this on the kirar and rubbed the whole carefully together to a semfluid mass. Then the craftsman strained this mixture through a piece of linen into a large empty mussel shell, and the \"paint\" was ready. Ths paint was applied to a carnelian stone using a reed pen. The painted stone was then allowed to dry, first in the hand, then by placing it on a metal plate over a charcoal fire. When fully dry, the carnelian was covered with live coals and the fire fanned for about five minutes. The piece was then removed from the heat and allowed to cool slowly for about 10 minutes under an inverted cup, at which point the craftsman rubbed his piece of carnelian briskly with a rag and handed it over for inspection.

The series stars the children\u2019s musical group [[Hi-5 (Australian band)|Hi-5]], with the spin-off being created to continue the concept with a refreshed appeal, after the brand was sold by the Nine Network in 2012. The program is known for its musical and educational content. ''Hi-5 House'' premiered on 4 November 2013 on [[Nick Jr. (Australia)|Nick Jr. Australia]].\n\nThe series is designed for a pre-school audience, featuring five performers who educate and entertain through music, movement and play. Music is an integral part of the series with the band's pop appeal resonating in the program. The segments of the show are based on an educational model. Julie Greene served as the executive producer for the program, having previously worked as a series producer on the original show. The cast is composed of [[Lauren Brant]], Mary Lascaris, [[Ainsley Melham]], [[Stevie Nicholson]] and Dayen Zheng. Brant was replaced by Tanika Anderson for the later two series. ''Hi-5 House'' received an [[Asian Television Award]] for Best Preschool Program in 2015.\n\nThe third and final series was made available worldwide on [[Netflix]] on 25 March 2016. ''Hi-5 House'' concluded as a result of the Nine Network renewing its partnership with the Hi-5 franchise in October 2016 with plans to revive the original program with a new cast in 2017.\n\n==Series overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color1    = #ADFF56 \n| link1 = List of Hi-5 House episodes#Series 1 (2013)\n| episodes1 = 25\n| start1    = {{start date|2013|11|4|df=y}}<ref name=\"s14\">{{cite news|url=http://nickalive.blogspot.com.au/2013/11/nick-jr-australia-and-new-zealand-debut.html |date=10 November 2013|title=Nick Jr. Australia And New Zealand Debut New Preschool Shows \"Hi-5 House\" And \"Doozers\"; Announces New Hi-5 \"House Party Tour\" | newspaper= Nickalive.blogspot.com.au | accessdate = 27 September 2017}}</ref>\n| end1      = {{end date|2013|12|6|df=y}}\n| network1 = Nick Jr.\n\n| color2    = #AE83DF\n| link2 = List of Hi-5 House episodes#Series 2 (2014)\n| episodes2 = 25\n| start2    = {{start date|2014|10|6|df=y}}<ref name=\"series15\">{{cite news|url=http://www.girl.com.au/hi-5-house.htm |date=October 2014 | title = ''Hi-5 House'' |newspaper=Girl.com.au |accessdate= 18 October 2016}}</ref>\n| end2      = {{end date|2014|11|7|df=y}}\n\n| color3    = #FF56C4\n| link3 = List of Hi-5 House episodes#Series 3 (2016)\n| episodes3 = 25\n| start3    = {{start date|2016|03|25|df=y}}<ref name=\"netflix\">{{cite news|url=http://usa.newonnetflix.info/info/80093413/s |last=|first=|date=|title='Hi-5 House' on Netflix USA |newspaper= New on Netflix USA |publisher= |access-date= 9 October 2016}}</ref>\n| end3      = start\n| network3 = Netflix\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Episodes==\n===Series 1 (2013)===\n{{Episode table|background=#ADFF56|overall=|series=|title=|aux1=|aux1T=Song of the Week|aux2=|aux2T=Theme|airdate=|viewers=|viewers_type=|country=Australian\n|titleR=\n|airdateR=\n|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = Explore My Space\n| Aux1            = Come on in\n| Aux2            = Home\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|11|4|df=yes}}\n| Viewers         = 47,000<ref>{{cite web|title=Monday 4 November 2013|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/11/monday-4-november-2013.html|publisher=TV Tonight|accessdate=1 November 2016|date=5 November 2013}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Stevie uses his new building blocks to make different things and transform into different people.

The story began in the late evening of 9 June 1906, when the protagonist Robert Gordon was born. The early part of the book is mostly about the early life of Robert, including how he found and lost his true love, Marie Stanton, who was born on 6 October 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ytemagazine.com/w-d-ganns-mundane-seasonal-cycles-d-k-burton/|title=W.D.

However, the war in the book was from 1930 to 1932, whereas the Second World War started about ten years later. Therefore, unless Gann was making a very serious mistake, he could not be referring to it.

Amundsen noted that Marie disappeared on 5 June 1927, when the Moon was in Leo, and she reappeared on 30 August 1932, when the Moon was in Leo again.\n\nHe also noted that the date of the Foreword was 9 May 1927, which was 1940 days before the end of the novel, 30 August 1932.\n\n=== Book cover ===\nThe original 1927 book cover depicts some planes flying around a tunnel in the sky. Paul Nipperess<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gann.su/book/eng/11998.pdf|title=Introduction to Gann Signs|last=Nipperess|first=Paul|date=2004|access-date=13 Feb 2018}}</ref> notices that the number and location of planes displays some [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci relationships]].\n\n=== Fake quotes ===\nThere are a number of quotes in the book which are unclear if they are really said or written by the person.<ref name=\":6\" /> For example, on page 191, Gann \u201cquoted\u201d [[Pythagoras]] in the following passage: \u201c\u2018There are in woman\u2019s eyes two sorts of tears, the one of grief; the other of deceit.\u2019 I think that is because there are two kinds of men, one who appreciates love and honor and gives sympathy; the other kind who is selfish, expects something for nothing and must meet with deceit.\u201d Brian Sklenka<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> thinks that Gann was trying to draw the readers\u2019 attention to the Pyathagoras, and the numbers \u201ctwo\u201d and \u201cone\u201d, indirectly hinting that the [[Octave|octave theory]] discovered by the Greek philosopher.\n\nSimilarly, on page 192, Gann included the following \u201cquote\u201d from [[Robert Southey|Southey]], \u201cThere are three things a wise man will not trust, the wind, the sunshine of an April day and a woman\u2019s plighted faith.\u201d Again, it is an association of the British poet and the number \u201cthree\u201d, which is an indirect reference to his famous story [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]. Some esoteric writers like S. J. Pasagic<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancient Whisper|last=Pasagic|first=S. J.|publisher=RoseDog Books|year=2011|isbn=9781434975454|location=Pittsburgh, PA|pages=}}</ref> believes that the story is a hidden reference to the Law of Three (see [[Fourth Way#Basis of teachings|the teachings of George Gurdjieff]]).\n\n=== Page numbers ===\nMany believe that Gann used the pages numbers in the 1927 original edition to encode some of his secrets.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://technical-analysis-addins.com/trading-gann-smithson.php|title=James Smithson on WD GANN|last=Smithson|first=James|date=2016|website=XL Trader|access-date=10 Feb 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rosecast.com/learn-astrology-with-the-tunnel-thru-the-air/|title=Learn Astrology with \"The Tunnel Thru the Air\"|last=Rosecast School of Financial Astrology|website=Rosecast|access-date=10 Feb 2018}}</ref> Here are some examples that the page number is related to the information on that page:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Page Number\n!Content of the Page\n!Remarks\n|-\n|12\n|This is a part of Chapter 2 in which Robert's mother expressed that \u201cBobbie had advanced ideas fully a hundred years ahead of his time and that he should be educated and allowed to follow his own ideas\u201d.\n|The page number (12) to the power of the chapter number (2) is 144.

The moment of parting Marie and Robert. The conjunction of Mars and Venus in Cancer, the Moon at the time of the onset of the event in 28 degrees of Cancer. \n# Paris, late February 1929. The illusion of meeting Robert and Marie. The conjunction of Mars and Venus in Cancer on a heliocentric chart. Moon Return on the geo-map. \n# New York, August 30, 1932, 11 am. Meeting Robert and Marie. Lunar return. The connection of Mars and Venus is very close to Cancer.\n\n== Weather forecasting along the Mississippi River ==\nIn 1994, retired engineer Bonnie Lee Hill did a public seminar in which she revealed some astrological methods concealed in the Tunnel Thru the Air.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some of the trading rules used by Gann are related to the weather in the area around the [[Mississippi River]], and they are listed below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Rule (as coined by Hill)\n!Planets\n!Time Window\n!Aspect Formed\n!Details\n!Implication in Cotton Prices\n|-\n|Wet Cotton Farmer\n|[[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Before mid-April of each calendar year\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Multiples of the 8th (45\u00b0) or 12th (30\u00b0) harmonic\n|If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the Mississippi River will flood in that year.\n|The supply would decrease and the price would go up.\n|-\n|Poor Cotton Farmer\n|[[Jupiter]] and [[Neptune]]\n|If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the rainfall along the Mississippi will be ideal to grow crops.\n|The supply would increase and the price would fall.\n|-\n|Dry Cotton Farmer\n|[[Saturn]] and [[Neptune]]\n|If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the Mississippi River area will experience horrible drought.\n|The supply would decrease and the price would go up.\n|}\nThe last rule (\"Dry Cotton Farmer\") was actually not mentioned at all in the book. It was deduced by Hill after she discovered the first two rules. Here are some actual examples from Hill's lecture:\n\n=== Wet Cotton Farmer (Uranus-Neptune) ===\n* In 1735, geocentric Uranus opposite Neptune. Over ninety percent of New Orleans was under water. The entire region was drastically affected by the flooding in the Delta.\n* In 1762, geocentric Uranus 135\u00b0 with Neptune. This was a major flood. For instance,the flood level in the city of Cincinnati was up 80 feet. The top of a church steeple was the only thing sticking out of the water in the little town of Cincinnati.\n* In 1821 (geocentric Uranus conjunct Neptune), we had another major flood. They called it the \u201cworst flood of the century\u201d. The reporters said that they had no words to describe the damage from this flood. They couldn't even estimate the cost of the damage. People decided give major sections of land back to the Mississippi River. They would not farm the land, and they would not build towns on the land. The people realized that the Mississippi River would always \u201cwin\u201d.\n* The next flood in the table occurred in 1881 (geocentric Uranus trine Neptune). Please notice that we had a major flood in 1881, and another major flood in 1882. Due to retrogradation, we had the same aspect (geocentric Uranus trine Neptune) on Feb 26, 1881 and April 8, 1882. There are cases in which we had major floods three years in a row because the same aspect occurred in the spring of all three years. The floods in 1881-1882 were very famous. Mark Twain was alive during that time. He actually went down the Mississippi River on a steam boat, and said the Mississippi River was 75 miles wide at that time. The channel of the Mississippi River was 75 miles wide. \n* The next flood in the table occurred in 1907 (geocentric Uranus opposite Neptune). This is the flood mentioned by Gann in The Tunnel Thu the Air. Please notice that we had a flood in 1907, and in 1908. Why? The same aspect occurred in the spring of both years. \n* The next big flood occurred in 1927 (geocentric Uranus 150 Neptune). This is the one that Gann predicts in The Tunnel Thru the Air. They had a late spring and a major flood. There was over $284 million in damage. It was estimated that 240 billion gallons of water came down the Mississippi River that spring. They had 1.8 million acres of land under water. A lot of people feel that this was one of the major causes of the Great Depression; the flood destroyed the economy through the Mississippi basin. This totally destroyed the cotton crops.\n* The next major flood occurred in 1935 (geocentric Uranus 135 Neptune). The same aspect occurred in the spring of 1936, and a second flood occurred. The flood in 1936 caused $270 million in damage.\n* In 1943, geocentric Uranus trine Neptune. A major flood occurred which caused $172 million in damage. In 1973, we saw geocentric Uranus semi-square Neptune. A major flood caused $420 million of damage. October cotton hit a high price of 99 cents at this time. In 1979, a major flood occurred. Geocentric Uranus was semi-sextile Neptune on March 31, 1979.\n* In 1993, geocentric Uranus was conjunct Neptune on February 2. What happened in 1993? The same thing that occurred in 1821, approximately 173 years earlier. Once again, the Mississippi River looks like an inland lake. Many, many acres are under water and they are currently discussing buying the land from the farmers, giving it back to the river, and saying we won't grow crops there again and we won't build buildings there again. The ticket for this flood at the time of the seminar was $12 billion.\n\n=== Poor Cotton Farmer (Jupiter-Neptune) ===\n* In 1844, cotton had an extreme low of 5 cents a pound. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune on April 27, 1844. Since this is rain during the growing season, you will find this class of aspects can happen a little later in the season. It's not required that they be more like January or February. They can be more like March\u2013April.\n* On March 2, 1851, geocentric Jupiter was 135 degrees from Neptune. Cotton hit an extreme low of 8.25 cents in January 1852.\n* On April 7, 1857, geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune. Cotton hit an extreme low of 9.25 cents in January 1858.In 1871, cotton hit the lowest low it had ever hit since 1860 (13.50 cents). \n* On April 8, 1871, geocentric Jupiter was sextile Neptune. In 1873, cotton hit another major low of 13.80. Geocentric Jupiter was trine Neptune on March 3, 1873.\n* Cotton hit another major low (6.20 cents) in 1896. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-square Neptune on February 26, 1896.\n* Geocentric Jupiter was square Neptune on March 14, 1904. This was a major low in cotton prices. On July 19, cotton sold for 6.85. The cotton farmers were so disgusted that they burned the cotton in the fields. They did not even go to the effort of harvesting it. Hundreds of cotton farmers abandoned their farms and left. It was not worth cotton farming again. No one would ever want cotton ever again. They gave up.\n* Very low cotton prices occurred in 1920. Geocentric Jupiter was conjunct Neptune on March 8, 1920.\n* On April 17, 1926, geocentric Jupiter was opposite Neptune. In March 1927, cotton hit a low of 11.80. The government reports showed a record crop.\n* Cotton hit a major low of 25.20 cents in December 1970. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune on April 29, 1970.Cotton hit a major low of 26.59 in December 1972. \n* On March 10, 1972, geocentric Jupiter was again semi-sextile Neptune.Cotton hit a major low of 29.99 in July\u2013August 1986. \n* On March 16, 1986, geocentric Jupiter was sextile Neptune.\n\n=== Dry Cotton Farmer (Saturn-Neptune) ===\n* In 1761, we had a major drought in the country. Geo Saturn was 135 degrees from Neptune on April 13, 1761. The next year, geo Saturn was again 135 degrees from Neptune on February 6, 1792. We had another major drought in 1762.\n* On April 13, 1816, geocentric Saturn was sextile Neptune. There was a major drought and crop failure in 1816.\n* On January 14, 1860, geocentric Saturn was inconjunct Neptune. The year 1860 is famous for the Kansas drought. Hundreds of people moved to Kansas tostart over. They planned to start farming, and make a fortune. Many of these farmers gave up and left Kansas after the drought of 1860. They said you just can't make it in Kansas. \n* On March 11, 1863, geocentric Saturn was opposite Neptune. There was a major drought. Cotton hit the highest price it had ever seen 91 cents. That is 91 cents in 1863 dollars. Why was cotton so high? First, there was a major drought. Second, the Civil War was disrupting the economy. \n* On February 1, 1869, geocentric Saturn was trine Neptune. In 1869, cotton hit a high of 35 cents before a huge decline in price.\n* On January 31, 1903, geocentric Saturn was inconjunct Neptune. The drought was so severe that cotton farmers planted their crops in a different manner. There was a little bug that grew in certain crops, and the farmers planted those crops next to the cotton. This little bug was called the boll weevil, and it decided that cotton tasted much better than the other crops. Suddenly, the cotton farmers had a major boll weevil infestation. The drought helped to cause a long-term problem with boll weevils.\n* A drought occurred in 1910, and on January 24 geocentric Saturn was square Neptune. \n* A drought occurred in 1930, and on December 29, 1929 geocentric Saturn was trine Neptune. \n* Geocentric Saturn was 135 degrees Neptune on February 21, 1931. A drought occurred in 1931.\n* The drought in 1933 was the famous Oklahoma Dust Bowl. On February 13, 1933, geo Saturn was inconjunct Neptune.\n\n== The Major Motors campaign ==\nFrom page 197 to 199, the book described how Robert traded the shares of a company called \u201cMajor Motors\u201d. It is in fact an alias for [[General Motors]], just as there is another company in the story called \u201cMajor Electric\u201d, which refers to [[General Electric]]. Quoting from page 197:\n\n\u201cOn Sunday, June 19, 1927, Robert Gordon spent the day studying his charts and working out his cycles for stocks, cotton and grain. He was short of Major Motors and was watching it very closely. On this day he made a new and great discovery of a time factor from which he figured that Major Motors would decline until about June 30th and then start an advance which would last until about September 16th, 1927, when the Company would be 19 years old and at that time the stock would reach final high and would then go down to February to April, 1929. He figured that the stock should advance to around 270 by September 16th and made up his mind to watch it closely and cover his shorts if it went down around June 30th, and then start buying the stock.\u201d\n\n=== Detailed trades and their astrological aspects ===\nBonnie Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> detailed the exact trades and their related astrological aspects as below, including both lunar aspects and transits to the GM incorporation chart on 17 Sep 1908:  (* Note: the transits with Pluto below are crossed out, because it was not yet discovered by 1927 when the book was written.)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Action\n!Astrological Aspects\n!Lunar Aspects\n|-\n|30 Jun 1927\n|Buy GM @ 192.50\nMajor Bottom\n|G Sun 150 N ASC\nG Sun 30 N Venus\n\nG Sun 90 N Saturn\n\nG Venus 30 N MC\n\nG Mars 30 N Mars\n|G Moon max North\nOne day after total solar eclipse\n|-\n|15 Jul 1927\n|Buy GM @ 204\nStart pyramid\n|G Sun 135 N ASC \nG Mars 30 N MC\n\nG Jupiter 0 Uranus\n|G Moon max South\nFull Moon\n|-\n|21 Jul 1927\n|Buy GM @ 214\n|G Mars 135 N Uranus \n|G Moon 0 North\nQuarter Moon\n|-\n|26 Jul 1927\n|Buy GM @ 224\n|G Mercury 135 N ASC \nG Mars 0 N Jupiter\n|G Moon max North\n|-\n|5 Aug 1927\n|GM up to 230\nRaised stop to 225\n|G Mars 90 N ASC\nG Saturn SD\n|Quarter Moon\n|-\n|8 Aug 1927\n|Stop loss was hit\n|G Venus 75 N ASC\nG Venus 0 South\n|\n|-\n|12 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 218\n|G Venus 0 N MC\nG Jupiter 0 G Uranus\n\nG Mercury Leo\n|Full Moon\n|-\n|20 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 228\n|G Venus SR\n|Quarter Moon\n|-\n|24 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 238\n|G Mercury 105 N ASC\nG Sun 0 N Jupiter\n\nG Sun Virgo\n|G Moon max South\n|-\n|26 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 248\n|G Venus 0 N MC\n|New Moon\n|-\n|7 Sep 1927\n|GM is at 253\n|''<s>G Pluto 0 N Neptune *</s>'' \nG Mercury 0 Venus\n|G Moon max South\n|-\n|14 Sep 1927\n|Buy GM @ 258\n|G NN 90 N Sun\nG Mars 0 South\n\nG Mars 180 G Uranus\n\nG Mercury Libra\n|G Moon 0 North\n|-\n|16 Sep 1927\n|Sell GM @ 272\nBirthday of GM\n|G Sun 0 N Sun\nG Mercury 0 South\n\nG Uranus 0 South\n|\n|}\nRegarding this plethora of astrological aspects, Hill only had the following to comment:\n* A major bottom occurs when geocentric Sun is square natal Saturn. \n* Gann sells when geocentric Sun is conjunct the natal Sun, and two planets are at zero South declination. \nOther than that, she did not go further to separate the wheat from the chaff, and delineate how other traders could apply this cluster of seemingly unrelated aspects to their trading.\n\n=== Relationship to eclipses ===\nGann strongly hinted at the astrological influence when he stated that Major Motors\u2019 share price would rise during this period because of \u201ca new and great discovery of a time factor\u201d which would make the price to stop declining \u201cabout June 30th\u201d. Daniel Ferrera<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Mysteries of Gann Analysis Unveiled!|last=Ferrera|first=Daniel T.|publisher=Sacred Science Institute|year=2001|isbn=|location=Santa Barbara: CA|pages=}}</ref> noted that there was [[Solar eclipse of June 29, 1927|a total solar eclipse on 29th June, 1927]], and Saturn was going [[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde]]. By the middle of September that year, Saturn had turned direct and returned to its spot during the eclipse. Also, this total eclipse fell with the Sun Square to natal Saturn. This is a seemingly very negative aspect, but Ferrera explains that the Natal Saturn was retrograde, and when a planet is retrograde, aspects are reversed that good aspects such as trines and sextiles become negative and bad aspects such as squares & oppositions become positive.\n\nFerrera also pointed out that, prior to the first trade on 30 Jun 1927, the total lunar eclipse on 15 Jun created some negative transits, because the Moon was in exact opposition to natal Pluto, and the Sun Square to the natal Sun. This is why Gann expected the price to decline into 30 Jun 1927 (except that, of course, Gann could not have been aware of Pluto, as it was discovered in 1930).\n\n=== Relationship to the Gann angles and the Hexagon chart ===\nAs James Smithson noted,<ref name=\":3\" /> Robert forecasted that Major Motor's share price would rise between June 30 and September 16, 1927 due to positive astrological influences. This is a period of 78 days, during which he forecast that the price would rise from 192\u00bd to 270, which rounds up to 78 points. After a rise of 78 points in 78 days (i.e. 1\u00d71 [[Gann angles|Gann angle]]) time and price would be squared and the uptrend would end. Similarly, Daniel Ferrera<ref name=\":5\"/> noted that the bottom price of $192\u00bd is in opposition to Jupiter & Uranus on the Gann Hexagon Chart, whereas the final price of $270 conjoins Jupiter and Uranus on the same chart, a complete 180\u00b0 movement.\n\n== The cotton campaign ==\nFrom page 195 to 197, the book goes into details how Robert traded cotton in 1927. Quoting from page 195 of the book: \u201cAfter Robert had sold out his October cotton at 17.30 and his December cotton at 17.50 on June 10th, he decided to watch the market very closely for a few days because he thought it would go lower. His forecast indicated last buying level around June 25th. He figured that after this time the market would go higher until September 5th to 6th, when he figured it would be final high.\u201d\n\n=== Relationship to the Wet Cotton Farmer rule ===\nAs indicated in the previous section, Bonnie Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> noted that Uranus was inconjunct with Neptune in that Spring, which would predict that a flood was coming and the cotton price would go up.\n\n=== Relationship to the Gann angles ===\nPeter Palaskas<ref name=\":4\" /> found that the support line is related to the 1\u00d71 angle whereas the resistance is related to the 4\u00d71 angle.\n\n=== Relationship to eclipses ===\nPeter Palaskas<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.timingsolution.com/TS/Articles/Peter_gardon/index.htm|title=Analysis of Robert Gordon\u2019s trades, from the book Tunnel Thru The Air - Part 1|last=Palaskas|first=Peter|date=|website=Timing Solution|access-date=17 Feb 2018}}</ref> found that the entry dates are related to the two solar eclipses on 3rd Jan and 29th Jun 1927.\n\n== Declination of major planets ==\nIn addition to the ecliptic longitude, cycles are also found by declination of the planets.<ref name=\":0\" /> On page 79, Gann wrote, \u201cHistory shows that in 916 agriculture in the British Isles was at its lowest ebb and that there was great scarcity of wheat and corn. Very few people were engaged in tilling the soil on account of wars. The same conditions prevailed 1000 years later in 1916 and 1917, when this country was called on to furnish food to starving Europe and send men and money to save their armies from defeat.\u201d Bonnie Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> explained that the common factor in 916 and 1916 is that geocentric Saturn was at maximum North declination in March. Since Saturn's sidereal year is 29.457 years, it is very uncommon for it to be at maximum North declination in March. Like the weather rules above, the astrological \u201csign\u201d occurs in the spring.\n\nAlso, on page 202, Gann discussed the great bull market from 1924 through 1927, \u201cHe went back into the stock market and in the great Coolidge Bull Campaign from 1924 to 1927 was again a dominant factor in General Motors and other stocks and was reputed to have made fifty millions, or more.\u201d Checking the geocentric ephemeris, and Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> found that in March\u2013April 1924, geocentric Jupiter was at max South declination, and geocentric Uranus in South declination during all of 1924. On July 8, 1927 geocentric Jupiter was at 0 North declination, and on May 1, 1927, geocentric Uranus was at 0 North declination. The declination of both planets was \u201cincreasing\u201d during the 1924-1927 bull market.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tunnel Thru the Air, The}}\n[[Category:1927 American novels]]\n[[Category:1927 science fiction novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n'''''The Tunnel Thru the Air, Or, Looking Back from 1940''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel written by market forecaster [[William Delbert Gann]] in 1927.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Financial Guardian Publishing Company|year=1927|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/tunnelthruairorl00gann|title=The tunnel thru the air; or, Looking back from 1940|website=The Internet Archive|access-date=10 Feb 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books/about/The_Tunnel_Thru_the_Air_Or_Looking_Back.html?id=1eRcta9cBocC|title=The Tunnel Thru the Air, Or, Looking Back from 1940|website=Google Books|access-date=10 Feb 2018}}</ref> In the Foreword, Gann hinted that this book is more than just a novel because it \"contains a valuable secret, clothed in veiled language.

He replaced the \u201c1940\u201d in the title with the following letters:\n* The number \u201c0\u201d is replaced by the letter \u201cO\u201d.\n* The remaining numbers 1, 4, 9 are worked in the following ways:\n** 1 x 9 x 4 = 36, 3 x 6 = 18, and the 18th letter is \u201cR\u201d\n** 1 & 9 are \u201c19\u201d, and the 19th letter is \u201cS\u201d\n** 9 + 4 = 13, and the 13th letter is \u201cM\u201d\nHe rearranged the letters, and the title became \u201cFrom the Lunar Return, Looking back to His Mother\u201d. Amundsen noted that Marie disappeared on 5 June 1927, when the Moon was in Leo, and she reappeared on 30 August 1932, when the Moon was in Leo again.\n\nHe also noted that the date of the Foreword was 9 May 1927, which was 1940 days before the end of the novel, 30 August 1932.\n\n=== Book cover ===\nThe original 1927 book cover depicts some planes flying around a tunnel in the sky. Paul Nipperess<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gann.su/book/eng/11998.pdf|title=Introduction to Gann Signs|last=Nipperess|first=Paul|date=2004|access-date=13 Feb 2018}}</ref> notices that the number and location of planes displays some [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci relationships]].\n\n=== Fake quotes ===\nThere are a number of quotes in the book which are unclear if they are really said or written by the person.<ref name=\":6\" /> For example, on page 191, Gann \u201cquoted\u201d [[Pythagoras]] in the following passage: \u201c\u2018There are in woman\u2019s eyes two sorts of tears, the one of grief; the other of deceit.\u2019 I think that is because there are two kinds of men, one who appreciates love and honor and gives sympathy; the other kind who is selfish, expects something for nothing and must meet with deceit.\u201d Brian Sklenka<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> thinks that Gann was trying to draw the readers\u2019 attention to the Pyathagoras, and the numbers \u201ctwo\u201d and \u201cone\u201d, indirectly hinting that the [[Octave|octave theory]] discovered by the Greek philosopher.\n\nSimilarly, on page 192, Gann included the following \u201cquote\u201d from [[Robert Southey|Southey]], \u201cThere are three things a wise man will not trust, the wind, the sunshine of an April day and a woman\u2019s plighted faith.\u201d Again, it is an association of the British poet and the number \u201cthree\u201d, which is an indirect reference to his famous story [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]. Some esoteric writers like S. J. Pasagic<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancient Whisper|last=Pasagic|first=S.

The moment of parting Marie and Robert. The conjunction of Mars and Venus in Cancer, the Moon at the time of the onset of the event in 28 degrees of Cancer. \n# Paris, late February 1929. The illusion of meeting Robert and Marie. The conjunction of Mars and Venus in Cancer on a heliocentric chart. Moon Return on the geo-map. \n# New York, August 30, 1932, 11 am. Meeting Robert and Marie. Lunar return. The connection of Mars and Venus is very close to Cancer.\n\n== Weather forecasting along the Mississippi River ==\nIn 1994, retired engineer Bonnie Lee Hill did a public seminar in which she revealed some astrological methods concealed in the Tunnel Thru the Air.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some of the trading rules used by Gann are related to the weather in the area around the [[Mississippi River]], and they are listed below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Rule (as coined by Hill)\n!Planets\n!Time Window\n!Aspect Formed\n!Details\n!Implication in Cotton Prices\n|-\n|Wet Cotton Farmer\n|[[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Before mid-April of each calendar year\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Multiples of the 8th (45\u00b0) or 12th (30\u00b0) harmonic\n|If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the Mississippi River will flood in that year.\n|The supply would decrease and the price would go up.\n|-\n|Poor Cotton Farmer\n|[[Jupiter]] and [[Neptune]]\n|If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the rainfall along the Mississippi will be ideal to grow crops.\n|The supply would increase and the price would fall.\n|-\n|Dry Cotton Farmer\n|[[Saturn]] and [[Neptune]]\n|If the two planets in question form any of the given aspects within the stated time window, then the Mississippi River area will experience horrible drought.\n|The supply would decrease and the price would go up.\n|}\nThe last rule (\"Dry Cotton Farmer\") was actually not mentioned at all in the book. It was deduced by Hill after she discovered the first two rules. Here are some actual examples from Hill's lecture:\n\n=== Wet Cotton Farmer (Uranus-Neptune) ===\n* In 1735, geocentric Uranus opposite Neptune. Over ninety percent of New Orleans was under water. The entire region was drastically affected by the flooding in the Delta.\n* In 1762, geocentric Uranus 135\u00b0 with Neptune. This was a major flood. For instance,the flood level in the city of Cincinnati was up 80 feet. The top of a church steeple was the only thing sticking out of the water in the little town of Cincinnati.\n* In 1821 (geocentric Uranus conjunct Neptune), we had another major flood. They called it the \u201cworst flood of the century\u201d. The reporters said that they had no words to describe the damage from this flood. They couldn't even estimate the cost of the damage. People decided give major sections of land back to the Mississippi River. They would not farm the land, and they would not build towns on the land. The people realized that the Mississippi River would always \u201cwin\u201d.\n* The next flood in the table occurred in 1881 (geocentric Uranus trine Neptune). Please notice that we had a major flood in 1881, and another major flood in 1882. Due to retrogradation, we had the same aspect (geocentric Uranus trine Neptune) on Feb 26, 1881 and April 8, 1882. There are cases in which we had major floods three years in a row because the same aspect occurred in the spring of all three years. The floods in 1881-1882 were very famous. Mark Twain was alive during that time. He actually went down the Mississippi River on a steam boat, and said the Mississippi River was 75 miles wide at that time. The channel of the Mississippi River was 75 miles wide. \n* The next flood in the table occurred in 1907 (geocentric Uranus opposite Neptune). This is the flood mentioned by Gann in The Tunnel Thu the Air. Please notice that we had a flood in 1907, and in 1908. Why? The same aspect occurred in the spring of both years. \n* The next big flood occurred in 1927 (geocentric Uranus 150 Neptune). This is the one that Gann predicts in The Tunnel Thru the Air. They had a late spring and a major flood. There was over $284 million in damage. It was estimated that 240 billion gallons of water came down the Mississippi River that spring. They had 1.8 million acres of land under water. A lot of people feel that this was one of the major causes of the Great Depression; the flood destroyed the economy through the Mississippi basin. This totally destroyed the cotton crops.\n* The next major flood occurred in 1935 (geocentric Uranus 135 Neptune). The same aspect occurred in the spring of 1936, and a second flood occurred. The flood in 1936 caused $270 million in damage.\n* In 1943, geocentric Uranus trine Neptune. A major flood occurred which caused $172 million in damage. In 1973, we saw geocentric Uranus semi-square Neptune. A major flood caused $420 million of damage. October cotton hit a high price of 99 cents at this time. In 1979, a major flood occurred. Geocentric Uranus was semi-sextile Neptune on March 31, 1979.\n* In 1993, geocentric Uranus was conjunct Neptune on February 2. What happened in 1993? The same thing that occurred in 1821, approximately 173 years earlier. Once again, the Mississippi River looks like an inland lake. Many, many acres are under water and they are currently discussing buying the land from the farmers, giving it back to the river, and saying we won't grow crops there again and we won't build buildings there again. The ticket for this flood at the time of the seminar was $12 billion.\n\n=== Poor Cotton Farmer (Jupiter-Neptune) ===\n* In 1844, cotton had an extreme low of 5 cents a pound. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune on April 27, 1844. Since this is rain during the growing season, you will find this class of aspects can happen a little later in the season. It's not required that they be more like January or February. They can be more like March\u2013April.\n* On March 2, 1851, geocentric Jupiter was 135 degrees from Neptune. Cotton hit an extreme low of 8.25 cents in January 1852.\n* On April 7, 1857, geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune. Cotton hit an extreme low of 9.25 cents in January 1858.In 1871, cotton hit the lowest low it had ever hit since 1860 (13.50 cents). \n* On April 8, 1871, geocentric Jupiter was sextile Neptune. In 1873, cotton hit another major low of 13.80. Geocentric Jupiter was trine Neptune on March 3, 1873.\n* Cotton hit another major low (6.20 cents) in 1896. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-square Neptune on February 26, 1896.\n* Geocentric Jupiter was square Neptune on March 14, 1904. This was a major low in cotton prices. On July 19, cotton sold for 6.85. The cotton farmers were so disgusted that they burned the cotton in the fields. They did not even go to the effort of harvesting it. Hundreds of cotton farmers abandoned their farms and left. It was not worth cotton farming again. No one would ever want cotton ever again. They gave up.\n* Very low cotton prices occurred in 1920. Geocentric Jupiter was conjunct Neptune on March 8, 1920.\n* On April 17, 1926, geocentric Jupiter was opposite Neptune. In March 1927, cotton hit a low of 11.80. The government reports showed a record crop.\n* Cotton hit a major low of 25.20 cents in December 1970. Geocentric Jupiter was semi-sextile Neptune on April 29, 1970.Cotton hit a major low of 26.59 in December 1972. \n* On March 10, 1972, geocentric Jupiter was again semi-sextile Neptune.Cotton hit a major low of 29.99 in July\u2013August 1986. \n* On March 16, 1986, geocentric Jupiter was sextile Neptune.\n\n=== Dry Cotton Farmer (Saturn-Neptune) ===\n* In 1761, we had a major drought in the country. Geo Saturn was 135 degrees from Neptune on April 13, 1761. The next year, geo Saturn was again 135 degrees from Neptune on February 6, 1792. We had another major drought in 1762.\n* On April 13, 1816, geocentric Saturn was sextile Neptune. There was a major drought and crop failure in 1816.\n* On January 14, 1860, geocentric Saturn was inconjunct Neptune. The year 1860 is famous for the Kansas drought. Hundreds of people moved to Kansas tostart over. They planned to start farming, and make a fortune. Many of these farmers gave up and left Kansas after the drought of 1860. They said you just can't make it in Kansas. \n* On March 11, 1863, geocentric Saturn was opposite Neptune. There was a major drought. Cotton hit the highest price it had ever seen 91 cents. That is 91 cents in 1863 dollars. Why was cotton so high? First, there was a major drought. Second, the Civil War was disrupting the economy. \n* On February 1, 1869, geocentric Saturn was trine Neptune. In 1869, cotton hit a high of 35 cents before a huge decline in price.\n* On January 31, 1903, geocentric Saturn was inconjunct Neptune. The drought was so severe that cotton farmers planted their crops in a different manner. There was a little bug that grew in certain crops, and the farmers planted those crops next to the cotton. This little bug was called the boll weevil, and it decided that cotton tasted much better than the other crops. Suddenly, the cotton farmers had a major boll weevil infestation. The drought helped to cause a long-term problem with boll weevils.\n* A drought occurred in 1910, and on January 24 geocentric Saturn was square Neptune. \n* A drought occurred in 1930, and on December 29, 1929 geocentric Saturn was trine Neptune. \n* Geocentric Saturn was 135 degrees Neptune on February 21, 1931. A drought occurred in 1931.\n* The drought in 1933 was the famous Oklahoma Dust Bowl. On February 13, 1933, geo Saturn was inconjunct Neptune.\n\n== The Major Motors campaign ==\nFrom page 197 to 199, the book described how Robert traded the shares of a company called \u201cMajor Motors\u201d. It is in fact an alias for [[General Motors]], just as there is another company in the story called \u201cMajor Electric\u201d, which refers to [[General Electric]]. Quoting from page 197:\n\n\u201cOn Sunday, June 19, 1927, Robert Gordon spent the day studying his charts and working out his cycles for stocks, cotton and grain. He was short of Major Motors and was watching it very closely. On this day he made a new and great discovery of a time factor from which he figured that Major Motors would decline until about June 30th and then start an advance which would last until about September 16th, 1927, when the Company would be 19 years old and at that time the stock would reach final high and would then go down to February to April, 1929. He figured that the stock should advance to around 270 by September 16th and made up his mind to watch it closely and cover his shorts if it went down around June 30th, and then start buying the stock.\u201d\n\n=== Detailed trades and their astrological aspects ===\nBonnie Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> detailed the exact trades and their related astrological aspects as below, including both lunar aspects and transits to the GM incorporation chart on 17 Sep 1908:  (* Note: the transits with Pluto below are crossed out, because it was not yet discovered by 1927 when the book was written.)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Action\n!Astrological Aspects\n!Lunar Aspects\n|-\n|30 Jun 1927\n|Buy GM @ 192.50\nMajor Bottom\n|G Sun 150 N ASC\nG Sun 30 N Venus\n\nG Sun 90 N Saturn\n\nG Venus 30 N MC\n\nG Mars 30 N Mars\n|G Moon max North\nOne day after total solar eclipse\n|-\n|15 Jul 1927\n|Buy GM @ 204\nStart pyramid\n|G Sun 135 N ASC \nG Mars 30 N MC\n\nG Jupiter 0 Uranus\n|G Moon max South\nFull Moon\n|-\n|21 Jul 1927\n|Buy GM @ 214\n|G Mars 135 N Uranus \n|G Moon 0 North\nQuarter Moon\n|-\n|26 Jul 1927\n|Buy GM @ 224\n|G Mercury 135 N ASC \nG Mars 0 N Jupiter\n|G Moon max North\n|-\n|5 Aug 1927\n|GM up to 230\nRaised stop to 225\n|G Mars 90 N ASC\nG Saturn SD\n|Quarter Moon\n|-\n|8 Aug 1927\n|Stop loss was hit\n|G Venus 75 N ASC\nG Venus 0 South\n|\n|-\n|12 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 218\n|G Venus 0 N MC\nG Jupiter 0 G Uranus\n\nG Mercury Leo\n|Full Moon\n|-\n|20 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 228\n|G Venus SR\n|Quarter Moon\n|-\n|24 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 238\n|G Mercury 105 N ASC\nG Sun 0 N Jupiter\n\nG Sun Virgo\n|G Moon max South\n|-\n|26 Aug 1927\n|Buy GM @ 248\n|G Venus 0 N MC\n|New Moon\n|-\n|7 Sep 1927\n|GM is at 253\n|''<s>G Pluto 0 N Neptune *</s>'' \nG Mercury 0 Venus\n|G Moon max South\n|-\n|14 Sep 1927\n|Buy GM @ 258\n|G NN 90 N Sun\nG Mars 0 South\n\nG Mars 180 G Uranus\n\nG Mercury Libra\n|G Moon 0 North\n|-\n|16 Sep 1927\n|Sell GM @ 272\nBirthday of GM\n|G Sun 0 N Sun\nG Mercury 0 South\n\nG Uranus 0 South\n|\n|}\nRegarding this plethora of astrological aspects, Hill only had the following to comment:\n* A major bottom occurs when geocentric Sun is square natal Saturn. \n* Gann sells when geocentric Sun is conjunct the natal Sun, and two planets are at zero South declination. \nOther than that, she did not go further to separate the wheat from the chaff, and delineate how other traders could apply this cluster of seemingly unrelated aspects to their trading.\n\n=== Relationship to eclipses ===\nGann strongly hinted at the astrological influence when he stated that Major Motors\u2019 share price would rise during this period because of \u201ca new and great discovery of a time factor\u201d which would make the price to stop declining \u201cabout June 30th\u201d. Daniel Ferrera<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Mysteries of Gann Analysis Unveiled!|last=Ferrera|first=Daniel T.|publisher=Sacred Science Institute|year=2001|isbn=|location=Santa Barbara: CA|pages=}}</ref> noted that there was [[Solar eclipse of June 29, 1927|a total solar eclipse on 29th June, 1927]], and Saturn was going [[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde]]. By the middle of September that year, Saturn had turned direct and returned to its spot during the eclipse. Also, this total eclipse fell with the Sun Square to natal Saturn. This is a seemingly very negative aspect, but Ferrera explains that the Natal Saturn was retrograde, and when a planet is retrograde, aspects are reversed that good aspects such as trines and sextiles become negative and bad aspects such as squares & oppositions become positive.\n\nFerrera also pointed out that, prior to the first trade on 30 Jun 1927, the total lunar eclipse on 15 Jun created some negative transits, because the Moon was in exact opposition to natal Pluto, and the Sun Square to the natal Sun. This is why Gann expected the price to decline into 30 Jun 1927 (except that, of course, Gann could not have been aware of Pluto, as it was discovered in 1930).\n\n=== Relationship to the Gann angles and the Hexagon chart ===\nAs James Smithson noted,<ref name=\":3\" /> Robert forecasted that Major Motor's share price would rise between June 30 and September 16, 1927 due to positive astrological influences. This is a period of 78 days, during which he forecast that the price would rise from 192\u00bd to 270, which rounds up to 78 points. After a rise of 78 points in 78 days (i.e. 1\u00d71 [[Gann angles|Gann angle]]) time and price would be squared and the uptrend would end. Similarly, Daniel Ferrera<ref name=\":5\"/> noted that the bottom price of $192\u00bd is in opposition to Jupiter & Uranus on the Gann Hexagon Chart, whereas the final price of $270 conjoins Jupiter and Uranus on the same chart, a complete 180\u00b0 movement.\n\n== The cotton campaign ==\nFrom page 195 to 197, the book goes into details how Robert traded cotton in 1927. Quoting from page 195 of the book: \u201cAfter Robert had sold out his October cotton at 17.30 and his December cotton at 17.50 on June 10th, he decided to watch the market very closely for a few days because he thought it would go lower. His forecast indicated last buying level around June 25th. He figured that after this time the market would go higher until September 5th to 6th, when he figured it would be final high.\u201d\n\n=== Relationship to the Wet Cotton Farmer rule ===\nAs indicated in the previous section, Bonnie Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> noted that Uranus was inconjunct with Neptune in that Spring, which would predict that a flood was coming and the cotton price would go up.\n\n=== Relationship to the Gann angles ===\nPeter Palaskas<ref name=\":4\" /> found that the support line is related to the 1\u00d71 angle whereas the resistance is related to the 4\u00d71 angle.\n\n=== Relationship to eclipses ===\nPeter Palaskas<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.timingsolution.com/TS/Articles/Peter_gardon/index.htm|title=Analysis of Robert Gordon\u2019s trades, from the book Tunnel Thru The Air - Part 1|last=Palaskas|first=Peter|date=|website=Timing Solution|access-date=17 Feb 2018}}</ref> found that the entry dates are related to the two solar eclipses on 3rd Jan and 29th Jun 1927.\n\n== Declination of major planets ==\nIn addition to the ecliptic longitude, cycles are also found by declination of the planets.<ref name=\":0\" /> On page 79, Gann wrote, \u201cHistory shows that in 916 agriculture in the British Isles was at its lowest ebb and that there was great scarcity of wheat and corn. Very few people were engaged in tilling the soil on account of wars. The same conditions prevailed 1000 years later in 1916 and 1917, when this country was called on to furnish food to starving Europe and send men and money to save their armies from defeat.\u201d Bonnie Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> explained that the common factor in 916 and 1916 is that geocentric Saturn was at maximum North declination in March. Since Saturn's sidereal year is 29.457 years, it is very uncommon for it to be at maximum North declination in March. Like the weather rules above, the astrological \u201csign\u201d occurs in the spring.\n\nAlso, on page 202, Gann discussed the great bull market from 1924 through 1927, \u201cHe went back into the stock market and in the great Coolidge Bull Campaign from 1924 to 1927 was again a dominant factor in General Motors and other stocks and was reputed to have made fifty millions, or more.\u201d Checking the geocentric ephemeris, and Hill<ref name=\":0\" /> found that in March\u2013April 1924, geocentric Jupiter was at max South declination, and geocentric Uranus in South declination during all of 1924. On July 8, 1927 geocentric Jupiter was at 0 North declination, and on May 1, 1927, geocentric Uranus was at 0 North declination. The declination of both planets was \u201cincreasing\u201d during the 1924-1927 bull market.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tunnel Thru the Air, The}}\n[[Category:1927 American novels]]\n[[Category:1927 science fiction novels]]\n", "name_user": "Victor CWT", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePage numbers:Typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tunnel_Thru_the_Air;_Or,_Looking_Back_from_1940"}

Abnormal findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to [[cervical cancer]]. The test was independently invented in the 1920s by Dr. [[Georgios Papanikolaou]] and Dr. [[Aurel Babe\u0219]] and named after Papanikolaou. A simplified version of the test was introduced by [[Anna Marion Hilliard]] in 1957.\n\nA Pap smear is performed by opening the vaginal canal with a [[speculum (medical)|speculum]] and collecting [[cell (biology)|cells]] at the outer opening of the cervix at the [[transformation zone]] (where the outer squamous cervical cells meet the inner glandular endocervical cells). Similar method is used to collect cells in anus of both women and men. The collected cells are examined under a microscope to look for abnormalities. The test aims to detect potentially precancerous changes (called [[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]] (CIN) or cervical dysplasia; the [[squamous intraepithelial lesion]] system (SIL) is also used to describe abnormalities) caused by [[human papillomavirus]], a sexually transmitted [[DNA virus]]. The test remains an effective, widely used method for early detection of precancer and cervical cancer. While the test may also detect infections and abnormalities in the [[Canal of the cervix|endocervix]] and [[endometrium]], it is not designed to do so.\n\nIn the United States, Pap smear screening is recommended starting around 21 years of age until the age of 65.<ref name=US2012>{{cite journal|last1=Moyer|first1=VA|last2=U.S. Preventive Services Task|first2=Force|title=Screening for cervical cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement.|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=Jun 19, 2012|volume=156|issue=12|pages=880\u201391, W312|pmid=22711081|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-156-12-201206190-00424}}</ref> However, other countries do not recommend Pap testing in non-sexually active females {{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}.

So it can be uncomfortable, but it is generally quick, and the information obtained may be critical.\n\nPeople with underlying pain or tissue diseases that can react to nociceptors being scraped or to excessive cold in the mucous membranes should take appropriate precautions and discuss the process ahead of time with their providers, in writing if necessary. A smaller speculum, [[lidocaine]] gel, and warming the instruments and lubricant ahead of time, along with extra time in the exam room and gentle technique, can all contribute to reducing the risk to manageable levels. These are reasonable accommodations to ask for and are aligned with good practice.\n\nMany people experience spotting or mild diarrhea afterward. The spotting is usually from the scrape on the cervix, and the diarrhea may be due to indirect stimulation of the lower intestine during the exam.\n\nMany health care providers are under the false impression that only sterile water, or no lubricant at all, should be used to lubricate the speculum. This may result in unnecessary discomfort. A number of studies have shown that using a small amount of water-based gel lubricant does not interfere with, obscure, or distort the Pap smear.

Liquid-based cytology often uses an arrow-shaped brush rather than the conventional spatula.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/pap-hpv-testing-fact-sheet | title=Pap and HPV Testing| date=2014-09-15}}</ref> The cells taken are suspended in a bottle of preservative for transport to the laboratory, where they are analyzed using Pap stains.\n\nPap tests commonly look for epithelial abnormalities/ metaplasia/ dysplasia/ borderline changes, all of which may be indicative of CIN. Nuclei will stain dark blue, squamous cells will stain green and keratinised cells will stain pink/ orange. Koilocytes may be observed where there is some dyskaryosis (of epithelium). The nucleus in koilocytes is typically irregular, indicating possible cause for concern; requiring further confirmatory screens and tests.\n\nIn addition, human papillomavirus (HPV) test may be performed either as indicated for abnormal Pap results, or in some cases, dual testing is done, where both a Pap smear and an HPV test are done at the same time (also called Pap co-testing).\n\n===Practical aspects===\nThe endocervix may be partially sampled with the device used to obtain the ectocervical sample, but due to the anatomy of this area, consistent and reliable sampling cannot be guaranteed. Since abnormal endocervical cells may be sampled, those examining them are taught to recognize them.\n\nThe endometrium is not directly sampled with the device used to sample the ectocervix. Cells may exfoliate onto the cervix and be collected from there, so as with endocervical cells, abnormal cells can be recognised if present but the Pap test should not be used as a screening tool for endometrial malignancy.\n\nIn the United States, a Pap test itself costs $20 to $30, but the costs for Pap test visits can cost over $1,000, largely because additional tests are added that may or may not be necessary.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bettigole C | title = The Thousand-Dollar Pap Smear | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 16 | pages = 1486\u20131487 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24131176 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1307295 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe test was invented by and named after the Greek-American doctor [[Georgios Papanikolaou]], who started his research in 1923.

Abnormal findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures and if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to [[cervical cancer]]. The test was independently invented in the 1920s by Dr. [[Georgios Papanikolaou]] and Dr. [[Aurel Babe\u0219]] and named after Papanikolaou. A simplified version of the test was introduced by [[Anna Marion Hilliard]] in 1957.\n\nA Pap smear is performed by opening the vaginal canal with a [[speculum (medical)|speculum]] and collecting [[cell (biology)|cells]] at the outer opening of the cervix at the [[transformation zone]] (where the outer squamous cervical cells meet the inner glandular endocervical cells). Similar method is used to collect cells in anus of both women and men. The collected cells are examined under a microscope to look for abnormalities. The test aims to detect potentially precancerous changes (called [[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]] (CIN) or cervical dysplasia; the [[squamous intraepithelial lesion]] system (SIL) is also used to describe abnormalities) caused by [[human papillomavirus]], a sexually transmitted [[DNA virus]]. The test remains an effective, widely used method for early detection of precancer and cervical cancer. While the test may also detect infections and abnormalities in the [[Canal of the cervix|endocervix]] and [[endometrium]], it is not designed to do so.\n\nIn the United States, Pap smear screening is recommended starting around 21 years of age until the age of 65.<ref name=US2012>{{cite journal|last1=Moyer|first1=VA|last2=U.S. Preventive Services Task|first2=Force|title=Screening for cervical cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement.|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=Jun 19, 2012|volume=156|issue=12|pages=880\u201391, W312|pmid=22711081|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-156-12-201206190-00424}}</ref> However, other countries do not recommend Pap testing in non-sexually active females {{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}.

So it can be uncomfortable, but it is generally quick, and the information obtained may be critical.\n\nPeople with underlying pain or tissue diseases that can react to nociceptors being scraped or to excessive cold in the mucous membranes should take appropriate precautions and discuss the process ahead of time with their providers, in writing if necessary. A smaller speculum, [[lidocaine]] gel, and warming the instruments and lubricant ahead of time, along with extra time in the exam room and gentle technique, can all contribute to reducing the risk to manageable levels. These are reasonable accommodations to ask for and are aligned with good practice.\n\nMany people experience spotting or mild diarrhea afterward. The spotting is usually from the scrape on the cervix, and the diarrhea may be due to indirect stimulation of the lower intestine during the exam.\n\nMany health care providers are under the false impression that only sterile water, or no lubricant at all, should be used to lubricate the speculum. This may result in unnecessary discomfort. A number of studies have shown that using a small amount of water-based gel lubricant does not interfere with, obscure, or distort the Pap smear. Further, cytology is not affected, nor are some STD testing.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Using Water-based Gel Lubricant During a Speculum Exam On Pap Smear Results|url=http://commons.pacificu.edu/pa/190/|journal=School of Physician Assistant Studies|accessdate=4 February 2012|author=Wright, Jessica L.|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nThe health care worker begins by inserting a [[speculum (medical)|speculum]] into the woman's vagina, which spreads the vagina open and allows access to the [[cervix]]. The health care provider then collects a sample of cells from the outer opening or '''os''' of the cervix by scraping it with an Aylesbury spatula. An endocervical brush is rotated in the central opening of the cervix. The cells are placed on a glass slide and taken to the [[laboratory]] to be checked for abnormalities.\n\nA plastic-fronded broom is sometimes used in place of the spatula and brush.

Liquid-based cytology often uses an arrow-shaped brush rather than the conventional spatula.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/pap-hpv-testing-fact-sheet | title=Pap and HPV Testing| date=2014-09-15}}</ref> The cells taken are suspended in a bottle of preservative for transport to the laboratory, where they are analyzed using Pap stains.\n\nPap Tests commonly look for epithelial abnormalities/ metaplasia/ dysplasia/ borderline changes, all of which may be indicative of CIN. Nuclei will stain dark blue, squamous cells will stain green and keratinised cells will stain pink/ orange. Koilocytes may be observed where there is some dyskaryosis (of epithelium). The nucleus in koilocytes is typically irregular, indicating possible cause for concern; requiring further confirmatory screens and tests.\n\nIn addition, human papillomavirus (HPV) test may be performed either as indicated for abnormal Pap results, or in some cases, dual testing is done, where both a Pap smear and an HPV test are done at the same time (also called Pap co-testing).\n\n===Practical aspects===\nThe endocervix may be partially sampled with the device used to obtain the ectocervical sample, but due to the anatomy of this area, consistent and reliable sampling cannot be guaranteed. Since abnormal endocervical cells may be sampled, those examining them are taught to recognize them.\n\nThe endometrium is not directly sampled with the device used to sample the ectocervix. Cells may exfoliate onto the cervix and be collected from there, so as with endocervical cells, abnormal cells can be recognised if present but the Pap Test should not be used as a screening tool for endometrial malignancy.\n\nIn the United States, a pap test itself costs $20 to $30, but the costs for pap test visits can cost over $1,000, largely because additional tests are added that may or may not be necessary.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bettigole C | title = The Thousand-Dollar Pap Smear | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 16 | pages = 1486\u20131487 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24131176 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1307295 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe test was invented by and named after the Greek-American doctor [[Georgios Papanikolaou]], who started his research in 1923.
