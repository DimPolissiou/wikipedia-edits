The adherence to Liao Chinese traditions has been suggested as a reason why the Qara Khitai did not convert to [[Islam]].{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=102, 196\u2013201}} Despite the Chinese trappings, there were comparatively few Han Chinese among the population of the Qara Khitai.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p= 96\u2013}} These Han Chinese had lived in Kedun during the Liao dynasty,{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=27\u2013}} and in 1124 migrated with the Khitans under [[Yel\u00fc Dashi]] along with other people of Kedun, such as the Bohai, Jurchen, and Mongol tribes, as well as other Khitans in addition to the Xiao consort clan.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=146}}\n\nQara Khitai's rule over the Muslim-majority [[Central Asia]] has the effect of reinforcing the view among some Muslim writers that Central Asia was linked to China even though the Tang dynasty had lost control of the region a few hundred years ago. [[Sharaf al-Zaman al-Marwazi|Marwaz\u012b]] wrote that [[Transoxiana]] was a former part of China,{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=98\u201399}} while Fakhr al-D\u012bn Mub\u0101rak Sh\u0101h defined China as part of \"[[Turkestan]]\", and the cities of [[Balasagun|Bal\u0101s\u0101gh\u016bn]] and [[Kashgar|Kashghar]] were considered part of China.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=99\u2013101}}\n\nThe association of Khitai with China meant that the most enduring trace of the Khitan's power is names that are derived from it, such as [[Cathay]], the medieval Latin appellation for China.

The adherence to Liao Chinese traditions has been suggested as a reason why the Qara Khitai did not convert to [[Islam]].{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=102, 196\u2013201}} Despite the Chinese trappings, there were comparatively few Han Chinese among the population of the Qara Khitai.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p= 96\u2013}} These Han Chinese had lived in Kedun during the Liao dynasty,{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=27\u2013}} and in 1124 migrated with the Khitans under [[Yel\u00fc Dashi]] along with other people of Kedun, such as the Bohai, Jurchen, and Mongol tribes, as well as other Khitans in addition to the Xiao consort clan.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=146}}\n\nQara Khitai's rule over the Muslim-majority [[Central Asia]] has the effect of reinforcing the view among some Muslim writers that Central Asia was linked to China even though the Tang dynasty had lost control of the region a few hundred years ago. [[Sharaf al-Zaman al-Marwazi|Marwaz\u012b]] wrote that [[Transoxiana]] was a former part of China,{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=98\u201399}} while Fakhr al-D\u012bn Mub\u0101rak Sh\u0101h defined China as part of \"[[Turkestan]]\", and the cities of [[Balasagun|Bal\u0101s\u0101gh\u016bn]] and [[Kashgar|Kashghar]] were considered part of China.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=99\u2013101}}\n\nThe association of Khitai with China meant that the most enduring trace of the Khitan's power is names that are derived from it, such as [[Cathay]], the medieval Latin appellation for China.

He joined alternative rockers, [[You Am I]], in 1993 on drums, percussion and backing vocals. He had previously been a member of [[The Bamboos (rock band)|the Bamboos]] (1986\u201387) and [[Kryptonics]] (1987\u201388). He established a record label, [[Reverberation (record label)|Reverberation]], in 2003 with his former Kryptonics bandmate, Ian Underwood.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nEarly in 1981 in Perth, Hopkinson was the lead vocalist and guitarist for Circle A, which included Don Burr on lead guitar and the Tarrant brothers: Dan on bass guitar and John on drums.<ref name=\"Brilton Bios\"/> They disbanded before the end of the year while Hopkinson and Burr (now on bass guitar) formed Zoo Rejects in the following year with Sean Pickergill on guitar and vocals, and Craig Weighell on drums.<ref name=\"Brilton Bios\"/> However Hopkinson soon left and joined Genocide, on drums, by mid-1982, with Costa<!-- last name not seen in reliable source --> on lead vocals, Matthew Snashall on bass guitar and Craig Tobin on lead guitar.<ref name=\"Brilton Bios\"/> Hopkinson later recalled growing up in Fremantle, \"I was really into punk rock. Being into punk rock in those days meant things could be pretty scary. I went to the same school that Bon Scott had been to, and we had a lot of run-ins while I was growing up. But there were lots of interesting people around \u2013 Fremantle's a port town, so you tend to get an interesting mix.\"<ref name=\"Emery\"/>\n\nIn January 1983 Hopkinson, Snashall and Tobin were joined by Ken Knight on lead vocals to form Mob Vengeance.<ref name=\"Brilton Bios\"/> Tobin left in August and they continued with a new guitarist.<ref name=\"Brilton Bios\"/> Knight became a local promoter and later recalled, \"[we] were one of the early Perth punk bands; there wasn't too many places we were actually able to play at the time. The West Australian public was a bit terrified of people with green and pink hair. We had a residency for a while with the Quick and the Dead, the big skinhead band at the time. We used to have to play in the daylight hours at the City Hotel.\"<ref name=\"Gordon\"/>\n\nIn 1984 Hopkinson replaced founding drummer, Michael<!-- last name not seen in reliable source -->, in Melbourne-based hardcore punk outfit, Vicious Circle, alongside Alby Brovedani on bass guitar and guitar (ex-Politburo), Paul Lindsay on lead vocals and Les Rumincik on lead guitar (ex-Politburo).<ref name=\"McFarlane VC\"/> Their early recordings include two tracks, \"Blood Race\" and \"Police Brutality\", on various artists compilation album, ''Eat Your Head'' (1984).<ref name=\"McFarlane VC\"/> The debut album, ''The Price of Progress'', followed in September 1985.<ref name=\"McFarlane VC\"/> Hopkinson left in April 1986 and was replaced by David Ross.<ref name=\"McFarlane VC\"/>\n\nLate in 1986 Hopkinson replaced [[Shakir Pichler]] on drums in Perth-based swamp rockers, [[The Bamboos (rock band)|the Bamboos]], which included Greg Hitchcock on guitar (ex-Go Starts, Grave Robbers).<ref name=\"McFarlane tB\"/> They issued a single, \"With Which to Love Her\", in October 1987 and they had already broken up.<ref name=\"McFarlane tB\"/> Hopkinson and Hitchcock joined local garage rockers, [[Kryptonics]], in mid-1987 with Jeff Halley on bass guitar (ex-Sunstones), and Ian Underwood on guitar and vocals.<ref name=\"McFarlane tK\"/> The line-up released an extended play, ''69'' (May 1989), on Waterfront Records; however, by that time Hopkinson was replaced by Andrew Robinson on drums (ex-Ritual).<ref name=\"McFarlane tK\"/>\n\nHopkinson formed [[Nursery Crimes (band)|Nursery Crimes]], a punky power pop group, in Melbourne in early 1989 with Paddy Chong on bass guitar, David Dixon on guitar and backing vocals, Caine Knight on lead guitar and Phil Rose on lead vocals (ex-Slush Puppies).<ref name=\"McFarlane NC\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Their debut single, \"All Torn up Iniside\", and EP, ''No Time for that Crime'', appeared late in 1990 on [[Au Go Go Records]].<ref name=\"McFarlane NC\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> The group's debut album, ''Fun Hurts!'', was issued in May 1992, which was co-produced by the band members with Kaj Dahlstrom.<ref name=\"McFarlane NC\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> At the end of that year Hopkinson was replaced by Chris Latham on drums.<ref name=\"McFarlane NC\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/>\n\nHopkinson was an occasional drinking buddy of [[You Am I]] members, whenever they visited Melbourne, from the turn of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> A month before the release of that group's first album, ''[[Sound As Ever (You Am I album)|Sound As Ever]]'' (November 1993), their drummer, Mark Tunaley, was \"ousted from the band.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane YAI\"/> Hopkinson was brought in as his replacement.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane YAI\"/> Ever since, he has been a core member of the band with Andy Kent on bass guitar and [[Tim Rogers (musician)|Tim Rogers]] on vocals, guitar and keyboards.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane YAI\"/> According to Australian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], Hopkinson \"supplied the boost of confidence required for You Am I to make the leap into the premier league of Australian rock.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane YAI\"/> His first major performance with his new group was an appearance at the second annual, [[Big Day Out]], national tour during January 1994.<ref name=\"McFarlane YAI\"/>\n\nHopkinson's only recorded lead singing role for a You Am I song is on a cover of [[the Mummies]]' track \"(You Must Fight to Live) On the Planet of the Apes\" which is the B-Side of their single, \"[[Good Mornin']]\" (September 1996). During a You Am I tour of the United States, their lead guitarist, [[David Lane (musician)|Davey Lane]], told Hopkinson that he had a side project, [[the Pictures]] which had recorded a demo.<ref name=\"Cashmere\"/> Hopkinson later described how \"[Lane] didn't know how to go about putting out a record so I told him that I would do it. After that, I put out a single for The Vines and also for Persian Rugs. That was fun so I thought I'd put out some proper CDs and that is how it started.\"<ref name=\"Cashmere\"/> The Pictures issued a single, \"You'll See\" (2001), on Hopkinson's Illustrious Artists label with [[The Vines (band)|the Vines]]' \"Hot Leather\" and Persian Rugs' \"Mr Tripper\" (both 2002) following.<ref name=\"Cashmere\"/>\n\nHe established a record label, [[Reverberation (record label)|Reverberation]], in 2003 with his former Kryptonics bandmate, Ian Underwood.<ref name=\"Nowland\"/> Underwood described how they formed the label, \"I'd known Russell by that time for about 20 years. We'd played in bands together, we'd been flatmates for a while and I worked for You Am I for a bit too. So Russell had Illustrious Artists and I had a couple of titles laying around as well and we realised that there wasn't anyone out there who wanted to distribute what we had, so we thought we'd have a shot at it ourselves. When we started, Russell had eight titles, I had a few and we just set (Reverberation) up in a room with our entire catalogue in a bookshelf.\"<ref name=\"Nowland\"/>\n\n==Drumming style and influences==\n\nRogers cites Hopkinson's drumming style as the key part of the group's sound. So much so that when he writes new material, it's the drumming ferocity that will decide whether the song will be performed by You Am I or Rogers' other band, the Tim Rogers and the Temperance Union. Rogers described him, as \"an enigma, a [[Polymath|renaissance man]] and the best drummer in the world.\"<ref name=\"Zuel\">{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/18/1063625154909.html?from=storyrhs | title = A bit on the sideburns | last = Zuel | first = Bernard | authorlink = Bernard Zuel | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | date = 19 September 2003 | accessdate = 14 October 2016 }}</ref>\n\nRusty is often seen to wear his drumming influences on his sleeve. In a Triple J radio [http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/music_specials/s1391535.htm J File] interview he comments \"I try to sound like three different drummers in every song [laughs]\", citing [[Ian Paice]] of [[Deep Purple]] as a key influence. Other sixties and seventies influences referenced include [[the Super Stocks]], [[The Pretty Things]], [[The Honeycombs]] and [[the Who]].\n\nWith several songs, particularly on the ''[[Convicts (You Am I album)|Convicts]]'' album, Rusty recorded the drum tracks after only rehearsing the piece two or three times. His [[Drum fill|fills]] are often heavily improvised.\n\nUpon the death of [[Syd Barrett]] in 2006, Rusty was interviewed on [[Triple J]] radio about the influence of Syd in the early days of [[Pink Floyd]]. He is also believed to be a fan of much other [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic era music]].\n\n==Equipment==\n\nSince 2001 Rusty has enjoyed a relationship with [[Pearl Drums]] whose drums he endorses wholeheartedly. On the 2006 ''Convicts'' tour, he played with a blue [[Pearl Drums|Pearl]] five-piece with two floor-mounted [[Tom-tom drum|toms]].  He consistently uses [[Zildjian]] Custom A [[cymbal]]s and New Beat 15\" [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]]. His snare drum collection includes a solid Jarrah Brady Snare (handmade Western Australian Drum), a 1968 [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig]] Superphonic snare and a handmade perspex Gas snare.\n\n==Side projects==\n\nAside from [[You Am I]], Rusty has also played with Australian [[Punk rock|punk]] act [[Radio Birdman]] on their ''Zeno Beach'' (2006) album and consequent tours. Other bands Rusty is said to have been associated with during the course of his career include Circle A, Zoo Rejects, Genocide, Mob Vengeance, Dismembered, Insurrection, Vicious Circle, Greenhouse Effect, [[The Bamboos (rock band)|The Bamboos]], Memento Mori, Cremator, [[The Kryptonics]], [[Nursery Crimes (band)|Nursery Crimes]] and Killing Time as well as playing on [[The Pictures]]' second album, ''Kicking Indiffference''. Outside of his band involvements, Rusty manages [[record label]] and distribution company [[Reverberation Records]].\n\nHopkinson comperes a show, \"Stronger Than Dirt\" (a reference to his beloved Mummies), on Sydney radio station [[2SER]] which features music from the last two centuries including Pre WW2 Folk and Jazz, Obscure Psychedelia, Gutter Punk, \"Blue\" Comedy records and Asian Go Go music.\n\n===Quotes===\n\n* \"Tim comes up with the [[Guitar chord|chords]] and the [[melody]] and we start playing it \u2013 I don\u2019t know I can speak in terms of drums being a drummer. I want to provide a back beat for people to be the foundation of the song\u2026 it\u2019s all about trying to make Tim\u2019s hips swing basically when I see him when in studio playing he\u2019ll pull off some move and you know you\u2019re in the right zone \u2013 it\u2019s just about turning each other on and enjoy playing to each other.

He joined alternative rockers, [[You Am I]], in 1993 on drums, percussion and backing vocals. He had previously been a member of [[The Bamboos (rock band)|the Bamboos]] (1986\u201387) and [[Kryptonics]] (1987\u201388). He established a record label, [[Reverberation (record label)|Reverberation]], in 2003 with his former Kryptonics band mate, Ian Underwood.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nEarly in 1981 in Perth, Hopkinson was the lead vocalist and guitarist for Circle A, which included Don Burr on lead guitar and the Tarrant brothers: Dan on bass guitar and John on drums.<ref name=\"Brilton Bios\"/> They disbanded before the end of the year while Hopkinson and Burr (now on bass guitar) formed Zoo Rejects in the following year with Sean Pickergill on guitar and vocals, and Craig Weighell on drums.<ref name=\"Brilton Bios\"/> However Hopkinson soon left and joined Genocide, on drums, by mid-1982, with Costa<!-- last name not seen in reliable source --> on lead vocals, Matthew Snashall on bass guitar and Craig Tobin on lead guitar.<ref name=\"Brilton Bios\"/> Hopkinson later recalled growing up in Fremantle, \"I was really into punk rock. Being into punk rock in those days meant things could be pretty scary. I went to the same school that Bon Scott had been to, and we had a lot of run-ins while I was growing up. But there were lots of interesting people around \u2013 Fremantle's a port town, so you tend to get an interesting mix.\"<ref name=\"Emery\"/>\n\nIn January 1983 Hopkinson, Snashall and Tobin were joined by Ken Knight on lead vocals to form Mob Vengeance.<ref name=\"Brilton Bios\"/> Tobin left in August and they continued with a new guitarist.<ref name=\"Brilton Bios\"/> Knight became a local promoter and later recalled, \"[we] were one of the early Perth punk bands; there wasn't too many places we were actually able to play at the time. The West Australian public was a bit terrified of people with green and pink hair. We had a residency for a while with the Quick and the Dead, the big skinhead band at the time. We used to have to play in the daylight hours at the City Hotel.\"<ref name=\"Gordon\"/>\n\nIn 1984 Hopkinson replaced founding drummer, Michael<!-- last name not seen in reliable source -->, in Melbourne-based hardcore punk outfit, Vicious Circle, alongside Alby Brovedani on bass guitar and guitar (ex-Politburo), Paul Lindsay on lead vocals and Les Rumincik on lead guitar (ex-Politburo).<ref name=\"McFarlane VC\"/> Their early recordings include two tracks, \"Blood Race\" and \"Police Brutality\", on various artists compilation album, ''Eat Your Head'' (1984).<ref name=\"McFarlane VC\"/> The debut album, ''The Price of Progress'', followed in September 1985.<ref name=\"McFarlane VC\"/> Hopkinson left in April 1986 and was replaced by David Ross.<ref name=\"McFarlane VC\"/>\n\nLate in 1986 Hopkinson replaced [[Shakir Pichler]] on drums in Perth-based swamp rockers, [[The Bamboos (rock band)|the Bamboos]], which included Greg Hitchcock on guitar (ex-Go Starts, Grave Robbers).<ref name=\"McFarlane tB\"/> They issued a single, \"With Which to Love Her\", in October 1987 and they had already broken up.<ref name=\"McFarlane tB\"/> Hopkinson and Hitchcock joined local garage rockers, [[Kryptonics]], in mid-1987 with Jeff Halley on bass guitar (ex-Sunstones), and Ian Underwood on guitar and vocals.<ref name=\"McFarlane tK\"/> The line-up released an extended play, ''69'' (May 1989), on Waterfront Records; however, by that time Hopkinson was replaced by Andrew Robinson on drums (ex-Ritual).<ref name=\"McFarlane tK\"/>\n\nHopkinson formed [[Nursery Crimes (band)|Nursery Crimes]], a punky power pop group, in Melbourne in early 1989 with Paddy Chong on bass guitar, David Dixon on guitar and backing vocals, Caine Knight on lead guitar and Phil Rose on lead vocals (ex-Slush Puppies).<ref name=\"McFarlane NC\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Their debut single, \"All Torn up Iniside\", and EP, ''No Time for that Crime'', appeared late in 1990 on [[Au Go Go Records]].<ref name=\"McFarlane NC\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> The group's debut album, ''Fun Hurts!'', was issued in May 1992, which was co-produced by the band members with Kaj Dahlstrom.<ref name=\"McFarlane NC\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> At the end of that year Hopkinson was replaced by Chris Latham on drums.<ref name=\"McFarlane NC\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/>\n\nHopkinson was an occasional drinking buddy of [[You Am I]] members, whenever they visited Melbourne, from the turn of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> A month before the release of that group's first album, ''[[Sound As Ever (You Am I album)|Sound As Ever]]'' (November 1993), their drummer, Mark Tunaley, was \"ousted from the band.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane YAI\"/> Hopkinson was brought in as his replacement.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane YAI\"/> Ever since, he has been a core member of the band with Andy Kent on bass guitar and [[Tim Rogers (musician)|Tim Rogers]] on vocals, guitar and keyboards.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane YAI\"/> According to Australian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], Hopkinson \"supplied the boost of confidence required for You Am I to make the leap into the premier league of Australian rock.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane YAI\"/> His first major performance with his new group was an appearance at the second annual, [[Big Day Out]], national tour during January 1994.<ref name=\"McFarlane YAI\"/>\n\nHopkinson's only recorded lead singing role for a You Am I song is on a cover of [[the Mummies]]' track \"(You Must Fight to Live) On the Planet of the Apes\" which is the B-Side of their single, \"[[Good Mornin']]\" (September 1996). During a You Am I tour of the United States, their lead guitarist, [[David Lane (musician)|Davey Lane]], told Hopkinson that he had a side project, [[the Pictures]] which had recorded a demo.<ref name=\"Cashmere\"/> Hopkinson later described how \"[Lane] didn't know how to go about putting out a record so I told him that I would do it. After that, I put out a single for The Vines and also for Persian Rugs. That was fun so I thought I'd put out some proper CDs and that is how it started.\"<ref name=\"Cashmere\"/> The Pictures issued a single, \"You'll See\" (2001), on Hopkinson's Illustrious Artists label with [[The Vines (band)|the Vines]]' \"Hot Leather\" and Persian Rugs' \"Mr Tripper\" (both 2002) following.<ref name=\"Cashmere\"/>\n\nHe established a record label, [[Reverberation (record label)|Reverberation]], in 2003 with his former Kryptonics band mate, Ian Underwood.<ref name=\"Nowland\"/> Underwood described how they formed the label, \"I'd known Russell by that time for about 20 years. We'd played in bands together, we'd been flatmates for a while and I worked for You Am I for a bit too. So Russell had Illustrious Artists and I had a couple of titles laying around as well and we realised that there wasn't anyone out there who wanted to distribute what we had, so we thought we'd have a shot at it ourselves. When we started, Russell had eight titles, I had a few and we just set (Reverberation) up in a room with our entire catalogue in a bookshelf.\"<ref name=\"Nowland\"/>\n\n==Drumming style and influences==\n\nRogers cites Hopkinson's drumming style as the key part of the group's sound. So much so that when he writes new material, it's the drumming ferocity that will decide whether the song will be performed by You Am I or Rogers' other band, the Tim Rogers and the Temperance Union. Rogers described him, as \"an enigma, a [[Polymath|renaissance man]] and the best drummer in the world.\"<ref name=\"Zuel\">{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/18/1063625154909.html?from=storyrhs | title = A bit on the sideburns | last = Zuel | first = Bernard | authorlink = Bernard Zuel | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | date = 19 September 2003 | accessdate = 14 October 2016 }}</ref>\n\nRusty is often seen to wear his drumming influences on his sleeve. In a Triple J radio [http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/music_specials/s1391535.htm J File] interview he comments \"I try to sound like three different drummers in every song [laughs]\", citing [[Ian Paice]] of [[Deep Purple]] as a key influence. Other sixties and seventies influences referenced include [[the Super Stocks]], [[The Pretty Things]], [[The Honeycombs]] and [[the Who]].\n\nWith several songs, particularly on the ''[[Convicts (You Am I album)|Convicts]]'' album, Rusty recorded the drum tracks after only rehearsing the piece two or three times. His [[Drum fill|fills]] are often heavily improvised.\n\nUpon the death of [[Syd Barrett]] in 2006, Rusty was interviewed on [[Triple J]] radio about the influence of Syd in the early days of [[Pink Floyd]]. He is also believed to be a fan of much other [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic era music]].\n\n==Equipment==\n\nSince 2001 Rusty has enjoyed a relationship with [[Pearl Drums]] whose drums he endorses wholeheartedly. On the 2006 ''Convicts'' tour, he played with a blue [[Pearl Drums|Pearl]] five-piece with two floor-mounted [[Tom-tom drum|toms]].  He consistently uses [[Zildjian]] Custom A [[cymbal]]s and New Beat 15\" [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]]. His snare drum collection includes a solid Jarrah Brady Snare (handmade Western Australian Drum), a 1968 [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig]] Superphonic snare and a handmade perspex Gas snare.\n\n==Side projects==\n\nAside from [[You Am I]], Rusty has also played with Australian [[Punk rock|punk]] act [[Radio Birdman]] on their ''Zeno Beach'' (2006) album and consequent tours. Other bands Rusty is said to have been associated with during the course of his career include Circle A, Zoo Rejects, Genocide, Mob Vengeance, Dismembered, Insurrection, Vicious Circle, Greenhouse Effect, [[The Bamboos (rock band)|The Bamboos]], Memento Mori, Cremator, [[The Kryptonics]], [[Nursery Crimes (band)|Nursery Crimes]] and Killing Time as well as playing on [[The Pictures]]' second album, ''Kicking Indiffference''. Outside of his band involvements, Rusty manages [[record label]] and distribution company [[Reverberation Records]].\n\nHopkinson comperes a show, \"Stronger Than Dirt\" (a reference to his beloved Mummies), on Sydney radio station [[2SER]] which features music from the last two centuries including Pre WW2 Folk and Jazz, Obscure Psychedelia, Gutter Punk, \"Blue\" Comedy records and Asian Go Go music.\n\n===Quotes===\n\n* \"Tim comes up with the [[Guitar chord|chords]] and the [[melody]] and we start playing it \u2013 I don\u2019t know I can speak in terms of drums being a drummer. I want to provide a back beat for people to be the foundation of the song\u2026 it\u2019s all about trying to make Tim\u2019s hips swing basically when I see him when in studio playing he\u2019ll pull off some move and you know you\u2019re in the right zone \u2013 it\u2019s just about turning each other on and enjoy playing to each other.

It is also used as a seasonal base for [[Vueling]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1940\u20131989===\nThe airport was first established as a temporary military airport during the [[Spanish Civil War]], and remained open after the conflict for use as an emergency airport. In 1949 the site was used to operate some domestic and international tourist flights, but was then closed in 1951.\n\nIt was not until 1958 that work commenced to re-open the airport in reaction to the rapid development of the tourist market in the Balearic Islands, particularly in neighbouring [[Majorca]]. The airport was reopened on 1 April 1958 with the first destinations during that year including [[Palma de Mallorca Airport|Palma]], [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona]], [[Valencia Airport|Valencia]] and [[Madrid Airport|Madrid]].\n\n===1990 to date===\nThe airport was expanded progressively over the subsequent decades with runway, taxiway, apron and terminal enhancements designed to cope with the growing air tourist market which by the late 1990s was generating over 3.6 million passengers a year at the airport.\n\nIn 2011, the airport provisionally handled over 5.6 million passengers and around 61,000 aircraft movements, an increase of 11.9% and 8.4% respectively compared with 2010.<ref name=aenapax/>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Aegean

It is also used as a seasonal base for [[Vueling]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1940\u20131989===\nThe airport was first established as a temporary military airport during the [[Spanish Civil War]], and remained open after the conflict for use as an emergency airport. In 1949 the site was used to operate some domestic and international tourist flights, but was then closed in 1951.\n\nIt was not until 1958 that work commenced to re-open the airport in reaction to the rapid development of the tourist market in the Balearic Islands, particularly in neighbouring [[Majorca]]. The airport was reopened on 1 April 1958 with the first destinations during that year including [[Palma de Mallorca Airport|Palma]], [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona]], [[Valencia Airport|Valencia]] and [[Madrid Airport|Madrid]].\n\n===1990 to date===\nThe airport was expanded progressively over the subsequent decades with runway, taxiway, apron and terminal enhancements designed to cope with the growing air tourist market which by the late 1990s was generating over 3.6 million passengers a year at the airport.\n\nIn 2011, the airport provisionally handled over 5.6 million passengers and around 61,000 aircraft movements, an increase of 11.9% and 8.4% respectively compared with 2010.<ref name=aenapax/>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Aegean

{"title_page": "Homestay", "text_new": "{{for|the film|Homestay (film)}}\n{{see also|Category:Hospitality services}}\n\n'''Homestay''' is a popular form of [[hospitality]] and [[lodging]] whereby visitors share a [[residence]] with a local of the city to which they are traveling. The length of stay can vary from one night to over a year and can be provided gratis ([[gift economy]]), in exchange for monetary compensation, in exchange for a stay at the guest's property either simultaneously or at another time ([[home exchange]]), or in exchange for [[housekeeping]] or work on the host's property ([[barter economy]]). Homestays are examples of [[collaborative consumption]] and the [[sharing economy]].\n\n[[Farm stay]]s are a type of a homestay, in which the visitor stays on a working [[farm]].\n\nThe terms of the homestay are generally worked out by the host and guest in advance and can include items such as the type of lodging, length of stay, [[housekeeping]] or work required to be performed, curfews, use of utilities and household facilities, food to be provided, and rules related to smoking, drinking, and drugs.\n\nHomestays offer several advantages such as exposure to [[everyday life]] in another location, opportunities for [[cultural diplomacy]], [[friendship]], [[intercultural competence]], and [[foreign language]] practice, local advice, and a lower [[carbon footprint]] compared to other types of lodging; however, they may have restrictions such as curfews and work requirements and may not have the same level of comfort, amenities, and privacy as other types of lodging.<ref>{{cite news | first=Kalyani | last=Prasher | title=7 Reasons To Choose Homestays Over Hotels On Your Travels | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/07/01/homestays-advantage-over-_n_10767300.html | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=January 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Molly | last=Green | title=How a Homestay Will Make Your Experience Abroad Richer | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-a-homestay-will-make_b_9123246 | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=January 30, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=7 Benefits of Living with a Local Host Family | url=https://www.goabroad.com/articles/volunteer-abroad/7-benefits-of-living-with-a-local-host-family | publisher=Go Abroad | date=October 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The Pros and Cons of a Homestay Abroad | url=https://www.gooverseas.com/blog/pros-and-cons-homestay-abroad | first=Elaine | last=Andres | publisher=Go Overseas | date=April 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Airbnb vs. Hotel: Which is Right For You? | url=https://www.travelpulse.com/news/hotels-and-resorts/airbnb-vs-hotel-which-is-right-for-you.html | first1=Kelly | first2=Ryan | last1=McDaniel | last2=McDaniel | work=[[TravelPulse]] | date=January 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name=find>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandratalty/2013/11/18/the-south-american-experience-how-to-find-the-perfect-homestay/ | title=Experience South America And Find The Perfect Homestay | magazine=[[Forbes]] | date=November 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Rivers | first=William P. | year=1998 | title=Is Being There Enough?
