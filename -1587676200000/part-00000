On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. \n\nThe first cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13.

On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. \n\nThe first cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13.

[[Mass trespass of Kinder Scout|Kinder Scout was the site of a mass trespass in 1932.]]]]\nThe '''freedom to roam''', or \"'''everyman's right'''\", is the general public's right to access certain public or privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for [[recreation]] and [[exercise]]. The right is sometimes called the '''right of public access to the wilderness''' or the \"'''right to roam'''\".\n\nIn [[Scotland]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]] and [[Switzerland]], the freedom to roam takes the form of general public rights which are sometimes codified in law. The access is ancient in parts of [[Northern Europe]] and has been regarded as sufficiently basic that it was not formalised in law until modern times. However, the right usually does not include any substantial economic exploitation, such as hunting or logging, or disruptive activities, such as making fires and driving offroad vehicles.\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]] public access rights apply only to certain categories of mainly uncultivated land.\n\n==Europe==\n=== Nordic countries ===\nAncient traces provide evidence of the freedom to roam in many European countries, suggesting such a freedom was once a common norm.  Today, the right to roam has survived in perhaps its purest form in Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Here the right has been won through practice over hundreds of years<ref>[http://www.caplex.no/Web/Magazine.aspx?id=allemann]{{in lang|no}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213175343/http://www.caplex.no/Web/Magazine.aspx?id=allemann|date=February 13, 2006}}</ref> and it is not known when it changed from mere 'common practice' to become a commonly recognised right.  A possible explanation as to why the right has survived mainly in these five countries is that [[feudalism]] and [[serfdom]] were not established there.{{citation needed|reason=source for that as explanation?|date=September 2012}} Another factor is the survival of large areas of unenclosed forest. Elsewhere in [[Europe]] land was gradually enclosed for private use and enjoyment, with [[commons|commoners' rights]] (for instance, rights to gather fuel or graze animals) largely eliminated.\n\n[[File:Telt.jpg|thumb|left|Camping in a forest in [[Femundsmarka National Park]], Norway]]\nToday these rights underpin opportunities for outdoor recreation in several of the Nordic countries, providing the opportunity to hike across or camp on another's land (e.g. in Sweden for one or two nights), boating on someone else's waters, and picking [[wildflower]]s, [[mushroom]]s and berries. However, with these rights come responsibilities; that is, an obligation neither to harm, disturb, litter, nor to damage [[wildlife]] or crops.\n\nAccess rights are most often for travel on foot. Rights to fish, hunt or take any other product are usually constrained by other customs or laws. Building a fire is often prohibited (though in Sweden and Norway fires are allowed with proper safety precautions).  Making [[noise pollution|noise]] is discouraged. In some countries, putting up a [[tent]] in the [[forest]] for one night is allowed, but not the use of a [[Travel trailer|caravan]]. Access does not extend to built up or developed land (such as [[house]]s, [[garden]]s) and does not necessarily include commercial exploitation of the land. For example, workers picking berries may be legal only with the landowner's permission.\n\nThere are some significant differences in the rules of different countries. In [[Denmark]], there is a more restricted freedom to roam on privately held land. All dunes and beaches and all publicly owned forests are open to roaming. Uncultivated, unfenced areas are open to daytime roaming irrespective of ownership status. Privately owned forest have access by roads and tracks only.\n\n==== Finland ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn Finland, the freedom to roam and related rights are called ''\"{{lang|fi|jokamiehenoikeus}}\"'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and ''\"{{lang|sv|allemansr\u00e4tten}}\"'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (lit. \"the everyman's right\"), similar to other Nordic countries. Everyone may walk, ski, ride a horse or cycle freely in the countryside where this does not harm the natural environment or the landowner, except in gardens or in the immediate vicinity of people's homes (yards). Fields and plantations, which may easily be harmed, may usually not be crossed except in the winter. It is also possible to establish outdoor recreation routes on private land, based on an agreement on the rights of use or by official proceedings in accordance with the Outdoor Recreation Act, for example.<ref name=\"Ministry of the Environment\">{{Cite book |url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/159060 |title=Everyman's rights and the code of conduct on private land |date=December 2015 |publisher=Ministry of the Environmentnd |isbn=9789521144561 |access-date=2015-12-01}}</ref>\n\nOne may stay or set up camp temporarily in the countryside, a reasonable distance from homes, pick mineral samples, wild berries, mushrooms and flowers (as long as they are not protected species). One may [[Angling|fish with a rod and line]] (only still waters), row, sail or use a motorboat on waterways (with certain restrictions), and swim or bathe in both inland waters and the sea. One can walk, ski and ice fish on frozen lakes, rivers and the sea. Income from selling picked berries or mushrooms is tax-free.

One may not disturb the privacy of people's homes by camping too near to them or making too much noise, nor litter, drive motor vehicles off-road without the landowner's permission, or fish (excluding angling) or hunt without the relevant permits.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ymparisto.fi/download/noname/%7B2039A0E2-6CC0-4DB3-ABA2-21670806FDD6%7D/24256 |title=Everyman's right |publisher=www.ymparisto.fi |access-date=2014-10-19}}</ref> If horse riding causes more than a minor inconvenience or disturbance, an agreement for the long term use of the route must be made with the landowner.

However, the exact definition remains mostly uncodified and based on the principle of ''[[nulla poena sine lege]]'' (what is not illegal cannot be punished).\n\n==== Norway ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\nEveryone in Norway enjoys the right of access to, and passage through, uncultivated land in the countryside. The right is an old [[consuetudinary]] law called the ''allemannsrett'' (lit. the everyman's right), that was codified in 1957 with the implementation of the Outdoor Recreation Act.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/doc/Laws/Acts/Outdoor-Recreation-Act.html?id=172932 |title=Outdoor Recreation Act |date=28 June 1957 |publisher=regjeringen.no |access-date=2011-09-29}}</ref> It is based on respect for the countryside, and all visitors are expected to show consideration for farmers and landowners, other users and the environment. In Norway the terms ''utmark'' and ''innmark'' divide areas where the right to roam is valid (''utmark'', literally something like \"land outside [the boundaries]\"/\"[Out Field]\") and where it is invalid or restricted (''innmark'', \"land inside [the boundaries]\"/\"[In Field]\"). The law specifies ''innmark'' thoroughly,<ref>\"g\u00e5rdsplass, hustomt, dyrket mark, engsl\u00e5tt, kulturbeite og skogplantefelt og liknende omr\u00e5der hvor allmennhetens ferdsel vil v\u00e6re til utilb\u00f8rlig fortrengsel for eier eller bruker.

Cultivated land may only be crossed when frozen and covered in snow.\n\nThere are some basic rules that must be followed when camping in Norway:\n\n* People are allowed to camp at least 150 meters away from the nearest inhabited house or cottage.\n* [[Campfire]]s are not allowed in the forest areas from 15 April to 15 September.\n* Tourists are allowed to stay in one spot for only one day. After that, it is necessary to specifically ask for permission from the landowner. This rule excludes the mountains and the national parks.\n\nIn later years the right has come under pressure particularly around the [[Oslofjord|Oslo Fjord]] and in popular areas of Southern Norway. These areas are popular sites for holiday homes and many owners of coastal land want to restrict public access to their property. As a general rule, building and partitioning of property is prohibited in a 100-meter zone closest to the sea, but local authorities in many areas have made liberal use of their ability to grant exemptions from this rule. However, even if a land owner has been permitted to build closer to the shore, he may not restrict people from walking along the shore. Fences and other barriers to prevent public access are not permitted (but yet sometimes erected, resulting in heavy fines).\n\n[[Canoeing]], [[kayaking]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[sailing]] in rivers, lakes, and ocean are allowed. Motorised boats are only permitted in salt water. All waters are open for swimming \u2013 with the exception of lakes that are [[drinking water]] reservoirs (see for instance [[Maridalsvannet]]).\n\nWild berry foraging is part of the right. Picking cloudberries may, however, be restricted on privately owned land in northern parts of Norway.\n\nHunting rights belong to the landowner, and thus hunting is not included in the right of free access. In freshwater areas such as rivers and lakes, the fishing rights belong to the landowner. Freshwater fishing  may only be conducted with the permission of the landowner and by those in possession of a fishing license. Different rules apply for children under the age of 16. Children under the age of 16 have the right to fish without a license, a right codified in 1992. This right was tried and upheld in a ruling from the Norwegian Supreme Court in 2004. <ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn salt water areas there is free access to sports fishing using boats or from the shoreline. All fishing is subject to legislation to, among other things, protect biological diversity, and this legislation stipulates rules regarding the use of gear, seasons, bag or size limits and more.\n\n==== Sweden ====\nIn [[Sweden]] ''allemansr\u00e4tten'' (lit. \"the everyman's right\") is a freedom granted by the [[Constitution of Sweden]].

It also gives the right to pick wild flowers, mushrooms and berries (provided one knows they are not legally protected), but not to hunt in any way. Swimming in any lake and putting an unpowered boat on any water is permitted unless explicitly forbidden. Visiting beaches and walking by a shoreline is permitted, providing it is not a part of a garden or within the immediate vicinity of a residence (legally defined as the ''hemfridszon'').

Since 1975 the right to roam in forests is guaranteed by Federal law. In particular, walking, running, hiking, and resting are automatically allowed to the public in most forest areas. However, horse riding, bike riding, and camping are not, and may only be practised with the land owner's permission.  A large proportion of the forest area in Austria is owned by government bodies such as the ''\u00d6sterreichische Bundesforste'', but the same restrictions still apply. In some circumstances forests may be closed to the public for environmental reasons. The situation in mountainous areas is less clear, and differs from state to state. Some states, such as [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] guarantee a right to roam in mountainous areas (usually defined as above the tree line), for all recreational activities. In other states, such as Tyrol, Lower Austria, and Burgenland, no explicit right to roam exists and land owners reserve the right to deny access. In practice, however, such restrictions are rarely enforced, since mountain tourism is an important industry in Austria.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockprojects.com/download/OEAV_Rechts_Infotext_2004.pdf |title=Wegefreiheit im Wald und im Berggebiet |website=AV-Rechts-Infotext 2004 |publisher=Austrian Alpine Club |language=German |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100420/http://www.rockprojects.com/download/OEAV_Rechts_Infotext_2004.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-29}}</ref>\n\n===Czech Republic===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\n{{See also|Czech Hiking Markers System}}\n[[File:Robl\u00edn, turistick\u00e1 trasa.jpg|thumb|[[Czech Hiking Markers System]] for [[trail blazing]] has been adopted in Central Europe and elsewhere]]\nThe old legal institute of \"right of the way\" (imbedded in the Civil Code) has its roots in [[Austria-Hungary]] law. This legal institution is applied when one land owner has a need to go through alien lands for access to his own land.\n\nThe Nature and Countryside Preservation Act, gives a legal right to roam through country (\"ve\u0159ejn\u00e1 p\u0159\u00edstupnost krajiny\", public accessibility of countryside or wilderness \u2013 excluding parcels owned by a [[natural person]]). Some types of land are excluded from compulsory public accessibility: settled and building grounds, courtyards, gardens, orchards, vineyards, hop gardens, grounds destined for animal husbandry. Fields and arable land are excluded during seasons when herbage or soil would be damaged, pasture lands are excluded during cattle grazing.\nIn national natural preserves, national natural monuments, national parks and in the first zones of landscape protected areas, state authorities can restrict public access (ordinarily only to roads or only to marked routes). Special acts can exclude also other areas (e. g. military areas, rail tracks etc.).\n\nAccording to Forest Act, forests are publicly accessible (\"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed lesa\", common use of forest \u2013 including private ones) and citizens have a legal right to enter the forests. The right of gathering dry twigs lying on the ground and berries for personal purpose is also guaranteed. However, biking, sledge riding, skiing and horseback riding are allowed only on forest roads. Public motor vehicle riding is prohibited (highroads going through forest are not considered as parts of the forest \u2013 because they are not considered as \"forest land\" in land ragistration). Common use of forest can be restricted by the owner in military forests, protected areas, forest nurseries, forest orchards, deer parks, pheasantries etc.\n\nThe Road Act defines ''obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed pozemn\u00edch komunikac\u00ed'' (common use of roads \u2013 some road can be excluded), The Water Act defines \"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed povrchov\u00fdch vod\" (common use of surface waters).\n\n===Switzerland ===\nThe freedom to roam is guaranteed in [[Switzerland]] by the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. However, some [[cantons of switzerland|cantons]] have more detailed regulations concerning the rights of access of otherwise not authorised people.\n\nThe Swiss Civil Code provides that forest and pasture are accessible freely for everyone, as long as there is no excessive usage. Except in special cases like the protection of young forest or [[biotope]]s it is not allowed to fence in forest areas. This also applies to private property. Certain activities related to excessive usage and the potential to cause damage, such as events in the woods, or access with cars, may be dependent on special authorisation. Similar regulations are in place for land which is not usable (e.g. stretches of water, rock, snow and ice), regardless of the land being unowned (i.e. being under the control of the canton and not able to be claimed as private property) or privately owned. The canton may also choose to restrict the freedom to roam in order to protect nature (e.g. the gathering of mushrooms, berries, wood, etc. in forests).\n\n===Germany===\nIn Germany a limited right to roam, called ''Jedermannsrecht'', is guaranteed by federal law.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The Federal Nature Conservation Act, the Federal Forest Act and the Federal Water Management Act allow everyone access to open landscape, uncultivated land, forests and water bodies, including cycling and horse-riding on tracks and paths. The right may be further regulated through state law.\n\n====Bavaria====\nThe [[Constitution of Bavaria]] guarantees everyone \"the enjoyment of natural beauty and recreation in the outdoors, in particular the access to forests and mountain meadows, the use of waterways and lakes and the appropriation of wild fruits\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Free_State_of_Bavaria|title=Constitution of the Free State of Bavaria}}</ref> The right is nicknamed ''Schwammerlparagraph''(mushroom clause). The article also oblige \"every person to treat nature and the landscape with care\". \"The state and the municipalities shall be entitled and obliged to maintain free access to mountains, lakes, rivers and other beautiful sceneries and to create free access by restricting property rights and to create hiking trails and recreational parks\"\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], outside Scotland, access to much uncultivated and unenclosed land was restricted prior the enactment of the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]]. Access to land in England and Wales is still more limited than in Northern Europe, and some other European countries, while access is very limited in Northern Ireland. Property was formerly protected in England and Wales mostly to preserve the landowner's hunting or fishing rights. The [[Ramblers' Association]], which works to increase the rights of walkers in the United Kingdom, was a driving force behind this legislation.\n\n==== England and Wales ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn [[England]] and Wales, after a polarised debate about the merits, rights and benefits of private landowners and public recreation, in 2000 the Government legislated to introduce a limited ''right to roam'', without compensation for landowners. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW) was gradually implemented from 2000 onwards to give the general public the conditional right to walk in certain areas of the English and Welsh countryside: principally [[downland]], [[moorland]], [[heathland]] and coastal land. Forests and woodlands are excluded, other than  publicly owned forests, which have a similar right of access by virtue of a voluntary dedication made by the [[Forestry Commission]]. Developed land, gardens and certain other areas are specifically excluded from the right of access. Agricultural land is accessible if it falls within one of the categories described above. People exercising the right of access have certain duties to respect other people's rights to manage the land, and to protect nature.\n\nThe new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales, with completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced. Traditionally the public could walk on established [[Footpath (right of way)|public footpaths]] and [[bridleways]], on [[common land]] and on the [[foreshore]], and land owners could prevent access to other areas (or charge a fee for access).\n\nAngling interests successfully lobbied for the exclusion of rivers in England and Wales from CROW, leaving other river users such as [[swimmer]]s and [[canoeing|canoeists]] with access restricted to less than 2% of navigable water. The [[British Canoe Union]] is running the [[Rivers Access Campaign]], to highlight the level of restrictions the public face in gaining access to inland waterways in England and Wales.\n\nMuch of the [[Dartmoor National Park]] has been designated as 'Access Land', although it remains privately owned, since the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985, with no restrictions on where walkers can roam.<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/localact1985/pdf/ukla_19850037_en.pdf Dartmoor Commons Act 1985] on the OPSI website</ref> Because of the 1985 Act, Dartmoor was largely unaffected by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which established similar rights in other rural parts of the country, but in 2006, this Act opened up much of the remaining restricted land to walkers.\n\n==== Scotland ====\nIn Scotland the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] comprehensively codified into [[Scots law]] the ancient tradition of the right to universal access to the land in Scotland.  The act specifically establishes a right to be on land for recreational, educational and certain other purposes and a right to cross land. The rights exist only if they are exercised responsibly, as specified in the [[Scottish Outdoor Access Code]].\n\nAccess rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming.\nThe rights confirmed in the Scottish legislation are greater than the limited rights of access created in England and Wales by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/bill/factsheet/index.htm#1 |title=Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000: Fact Sheets |date=2000-03-07 |publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813102505/http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/bill/factsheet/index.htm#1 |archive-date=2006-08-13 |access-date=2006-12-09}}</ref>\n\n====Northern Ireland====\nAccess rights in Northern Ireland have been described as being \"the most regressive and restrictive access legislation in Europe.

[[Mass trespass of Kinder Scout|Kinder Scout was the site of a mass trespass in 1932.]]]]\nThe '''freedom to roam''', or \"'''everyman's right'''\", is the general public's right to access certain public or privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for [[recreation]] and [[exercise]]. The right is sometimes called the '''right of public access to the wilderness''' or the \"'''right to roam'''\".\n\nIn [[Scotland]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]] and [[Switzerland]], the freedom to roam takes the form of general public rights which are sometimes codified in law. The access is ancient in parts of [[Northern Europe]] and has been regarded as sufficiently basic that it was not formalised in law until modern times. However, the right usually does not include any substantial economic exploitation, such as hunting or logging, or disruptive activities, such as making fires and driving offroad vehicles.\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]] public access rights apply only to certain categories of mainly uncultivated land.\n\n==Europe==\n=== Nordic countries ===\nAncient traces provide evidence of the freedom to roam in many European countries, suggesting such a freedom was once a common norm.  Today, the right to roam has survived in perhaps its purest form in Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Here the right has been won through practice over hundreds of years<ref>[http://www.caplex.no/Web/Magazine.aspx?id=allemann]{{in lang|no}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213175343/http://www.caplex.no/Web/Magazine.aspx?id=allemann|date=February 13, 2006}}</ref> and it is not known when it changed from mere 'common practice' to become a commonly recognised right.  A possible explanation as to why the right has survived mainly in these five countries is that [[feudalism]] and [[serfdom]] were not established there.{{citation needed|reason=source for that as explanation?|date=September 2012}} Another factor is the survival of large areas of unenclosed forest. Elsewhere in [[Europe]] land was gradually enclosed for private use and enjoyment, with [[commons|commoners' rights]] (for instance, rights to gather fuel or graze animals) largely eliminated.\n\n[[File:Telt.jpg|thumb|left|Camping in a forest in [[Femundsmarka National Park]], Norway]]\nToday these rights underpin opportunities for outdoor recreation in several of the Nordic countries, providing the opportunity to hike across or camp on another's land (e.g. in Sweden for one or two nights), boating on someone else's waters, and picking [[wildflower]]s, [[mushroom]]s and berries. However, with these rights come responsibilities; that is, an obligation neither to harm, disturb, litter, nor to damage [[wildlife]] or crops.\n\nAccess rights are most often for travel on foot. Rights to fish, hunt or take any other product are usually constrained by other customs or laws. Building a fire is often prohibited (though in Sweden and Norway fires are allowed with proper safety precautions).  Making [[noise pollution|noise]] is discouraged. In some countries, putting up a [[tent]] in the [[forest]] for one night is allowed, but not the use of a [[Travel trailer|caravan]]. Access does not extend to built up or developed land (such as [[house]]s, [[garden]]s) and does not necessarily include commercial exploitation of the land. For example, workers picking berries may be legal only with the landowner's permission.\n\nThere are some significant differences in the rules of different countries. In [[Denmark]], there is a more restricted freedom to roam on privately held land. All dunes and beaches and all publicly owned forests are open to roaming. Uncultivated, unfenced areas are open to daytime roaming irrespective of ownership status. Privately owned forest have access by roads and tracks only.\n\n==== Finland ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn Finland, the freedom to roam and related rights are called ''\"{{lang|fi|jokamiehenoikeus}}\"'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and ''\"{{lang|sv|allemansr\u00e4tten}}\"'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (lit. \"the everyman's right\"), similar to other Nordic countries. Everyone may walk, ski, ride a horse or cycle freely in the countryside where this does not harm the natural environment or the landowner, except in gardens or in the immediate vicinity of people's homes (yards). Fields and plantations, which may easily be harmed, may usually not be crossed except in the winter. It is also possible to establish outdoor recreation routes on private land, based on an agreement on the rights of use or by official proceedings in accordance with the Outdoor Recreation Act, for example.<ref name=\"Ministry of the Environment\">{{Cite book |url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/159060 |title=Everyman's rights and the code of conduct on private land |date=December 2015 |publisher=Ministry of the Environmentnd |isbn=9789521144561 |access-date=2015-12-01}}</ref>\n\nOne may stay or set up camp temporarily in the countryside, a reasonable distance from homes, pick mineral samples, wild berries, mushrooms and flowers (as long as they are not protected species).

The right is an old [[consuetudinary]] law called the ''allemannsrett'' (lit. the everyman's right), that was codified in 1957 with the implementation of the Outdoor Recreation Act.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/doc/Laws/Acts/Outdoor-Recreation-Act.html?id=172932 |title=Outdoor Recreation Act |date=28 June 1957 |publisher=regjeringen.no |access-date=2011-09-29}}</ref> It is based on respect for the countryside, and all visitors are expected to show consideration for farmers and landowners, other users and the environment. In Norway the terms ''utmark'' and ''innmark'' divide areas where the right to roam is valid (''utmark'', literally something like \"land outside [the boundaries]\"/\"[Out Field]\") and where it is invalid or restricted (''innmark'', \"land inside [the boundaries]\"/\"[In Field]\"). The law specifies ''innmark'' thoroughly,<ref>\"g\u00e5rdsplass, hustomt, dyrket mark, engsl\u00e5tt, kulturbeite og skogplantefelt og liknende omr\u00e5der hvor allmennhetens ferdsel vil v\u00e6re til utilb\u00f8rlig fortrengsel for eier eller bruker. Udyrkede, mindre grunnstykker som ligger i dyrket mark eller engsl\u00e5tt eller er gjerdet inn sammen med slikt omr\u00e5de, regnes ogs\u00e5 som innmark.

Cultivated land may only be crossed when frozen and covered in snow.\n\nThere are some basic rules that must be followed when camping in Norway:\n\n* People are allowed to camp at least 150 meters away from the nearest inhabited house or cottage.\n* [[Campfire]]s are not allowed in the forest areas from 15 April to 15 September.\n* Tourists are allowed to stay in one spot for only one day. After that, it is necessary to specifically ask for permission from the landowner. This rule excludes the mountains and the national parks.\n\nIn later years the right has come under pressure particularly around the [[Oslofjord|Oslo Fjord]] and in popular areas of Southern Norway. These areas are popular sites for holiday homes and many owners of coastal land want to restrict public access to their property. As a general rule, building and partitioning of property is prohibited in a 100-meter zone closest to the sea, but local authorities in many areas have made liberal use of their ability to grant exemptions from this rule. However, even if a land owner has been permitted to build closer to the shore, he may not restrict people from walking along the shore. Fences and other barriers to prevent public access are not permitted (but yet sometimes erected, resulting in heavy fines).\n\n[[Canoeing]], [[kayaking]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[sailing]] in rivers, lakes, and ocean are allowed. Motorised boats are only permitted in salt water. All waters are open for swimming \u2013 with the exception of lakes that are [[drinking water]] reservoirs (see for instance [[Maridalsvannet]]).\n\nWild berry foraging is part of the right. Picking cloudberries may, however, be restricted on privately owned land in northern parts of Norway.\n\nHunting rights belong to the landowner, and thus hunting is not included in the right of free access. In freshwater areas such as rivers and lakes, the fishing rights belong to the landowner. Freshwater fishing  may only be conducted with the permission of the landowner and by those in possession of a fishing licence. Different rules apply for children under the age of 16. Children under the age of 16 have the right to fish without a licence, a right codified in 1992. This right was tried and upheld in a ruling from the Norwegian Supreme Court in 2004. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Free_State_of_Bavaria|title=Constitution of the Free State of Bavaria}}</ref>\n\nIn salt water areas there is free access to sports fishing using boats or from the shoreline. All fishing is subject to legislation to, among other things, protect biological diversity, and this legislation stipulates rules regarding the use of gear, seasons, bag or size limits and more.\n\n==== Sweden ====\nIn [[Sweden]] ''allemansr\u00e4tten'' (lit. \"the everyman's right\") is a freedom granted by the [[Constitution of Sweden]].

Restrictions apply for [[nature reserve]]s and other protected areas. It also gives the right to pick wild flowers, mushrooms and berries (provided one knows they are not legally protected), but not to hunt in any way. Swimming in any lake and putting an unpowered boat on any water is permitted unless explicitly forbidden. Visiting beaches and walking by a shoreline is permitted, providing it is not a part of a garden or within the immediate vicinity of a residence (legally defined as the ''hemfridszon''). The ''hemfridszon's'' size depends on conditions but can be as large as 70 metres from an ordinary dwelling house.<ref name=\"NaturBB\" /> To better protect access to water and the right to walk along beaches, it is since 1975 generally not permitted to build a new house near (generally 100 m) from a beach and/or shoreline.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lagen.nu/1998:808#K7 |title=Milj\u00f6balk (1998:808) (MB) |publisher=Lagen.nu |access-date=2011-09-29}}</ref>\n\nFishing remains essentially private\u2014apart from on the biggest five lakes and the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]], [[\u00d6resund|the Sound]], [[Kattegat]] and [[Skagerrak]].

Since 1975 the right to roam in forests is guaranteed by Federal law. In particular, walking, running, hiking, and resting are automatically allowed to the public in most forest areas. However, horse riding, bike riding, and camping are not, and may only be practised with the land owner's permission.  A large proportion of the forest area in Austria is owned by government bodies such as the ''\u00d6sterreichische Bundesforste'', but the same restrictions still apply. In some circumstances forests may be closed to the public for environmental reasons. The situation in mountainous areas is less clear, and differs from state to state. Some states, such as [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] guarantee a right to roam in mountainous areas (usually defined as above the tree line), for all recreational activities. In other states, such as Tyrol, Lower Austria, and Burgenland, no explicit right to roam exists and land owners reserve the right to deny access. In practice, however, such restrictions are rarely enforced, since mountain tourism is an important industry in Austria.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockprojects.com/download/OEAV_Rechts_Infotext_2004.pdf |title=Wegefreiheit im Wald und im Berggebiet |website=AV-Rechts-Infotext 2004 |publisher=Austrian Alpine Club |language=German |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100420/http://www.rockprojects.com/download/OEAV_Rechts_Infotext_2004.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-29}}</ref>\n\n===Czech Republic===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\n{{See also|Czech Hiking Markers System}}\n[[File:Robl\u00edn, turistick\u00e1 trasa.jpg|thumb|[[Czech Hiking Markers System]] for [[trail blazing]] has been adopted in Central Europe and elsewhere]]\nThe old legal institute of \"right of the way\" (imbedded in the Civil Code) has its roots in [[Austria-Hungary]] law. This legal institution is applied when one land owner has a need to go through alien lands for access to his own land.\n\nThe Nature and Countryside Preservation Act, gives a legal right to roam through country (\"ve\u0159ejn\u00e1 p\u0159\u00edstupnost krajiny\", public accessibility of countryside or wilderness \u2013 excluding parcels owned by a [[natural person]]). Some types of land are excluded from compulsory public accessibility: settled and building grounds, courtyards, gardens, orchards, vineyards, hop gardens, grounds destined for animal husbandry. Fields and arable land are excluded during seasons when herbage or soil would be damaged, pasture lands are excluded during cattle grazing.\nIn national natural preserves, national natural monuments, national parks and in the first zones of landscape protected areas, state authorities can restrict public access (ordinarily only to roads or only to marked routes). Special acts can exclude also other areas (e. g. military areas, rail tracks etc.).\n\nAccording to Forest Act, forests are publicly accessible (\"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed lesa\", common use of forest \u2013 including private ones) and citizens have a legal right to enter the forests. The right of gathering dry twigs lying on the ground and berries for personal purpose is also guaranteed. However, biking, sledge riding, skiing and horseback riding are allowed only on forest roads. Public motor vehicle riding is prohibited (highroads going through forest are not considered as parts of the forest \u2013 because they are not considered as \"forest land\" in land ragistration). Common use of forest can be restricted by the owner in military forests, protected areas, forest nurseries, forest orchards, deer parks, pheasantries etc.\n\nThe Road Act defines ''obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed pozemn\u00edch komunikac\u00ed'' (common use of roads \u2013 some road can be excluded), The Water Act defines \"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed povrchov\u00fdch vod\" (common use of surface waters).\n\n===Switzerland ===\nThe freedom to roam is guaranteed in [[Switzerland]] by the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. However, some [[cantons of switzerland|cantons]] have more detailed regulations concerning the rights of access of otherwise not authorised people.\n\nThe Swiss Civil Code provides that forest and pasture are accessible freely for everyone, as long as there is no excessive usage. Except in special cases like the protection of young forest or [[biotope]]s it is not allowed to fence in forest areas. This also applies to private property. Certain activities related to excessive usage and the potential to cause damage, such as events in the woods, or access with cars, may be dependent on special authorisation. Similar regulations are in place for land which is not usable (e.g. stretches of water, rock, snow and ice), regardless of the land being unowned (i.e. being under the control of the canton and not able to be claimed as private property) or privately owned. The canton may also choose to restrict the freedom to roam in order to protect nature (e.g. the gathering of mushrooms, berries, wood, etc. in forests).\n\n===Germany===\nIn Germany a limited right to roam, called ''Jedermannsrecht'', is guaranteed by federal law.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The Federal Nature Conservation Act, the Federal Forest Act and the Federal Water Management Act allow everyone access to open landscape, uncultivated land, forests and water bodies, including cycling and horse-riding on tracks and paths. The right may be further regulated through state law.\n\n====Bavaria====\nThe [[Constitution of Bavaria]] guarantees everyone \"the enjoyment of natural beauty and recreation in the outdoors, in particular the access to forests and mountain meadows, the use of waterways and lakes and the appropriation of wild fruits\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Free_State_of_Bavaria|title=Constitution of the Free State of Bavaria}}</ref> The right is nicknamed ''Schwammerlparagraph''(mushroom clause). The article also oblige \"every person to treat nature and the landscape with care\". \"The state and the municipalities shall be entitled and obliged to maintain free access to mountains, lakes, rivers and other beautiful sceneries and to create free access by restricting property rights and to create hiking trails and recreational parks\"\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], outside Scotland, access to much uncultivated and unenclosed land was restricted prior the enactment of the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]]. Access to land in England and Wales is still more limited than in Northern Europe, and some other European countries, while access is very limited in Northern Ireland. Property was formerly protected in England and Wales mostly to preserve the landowner's hunting or fishing rights. The [[Ramblers' Association]], which works to increase the rights of walkers in the United Kingdom, was a driving force behind this legislation.\n\n==== England and Wales ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn [[England]] and Wales, after a polarised debate about the merits, rights and benefits of private landowners and public recreation, in 2000 the Government legislated to introduce a limited ''right to roam'', without compensation for landowners. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW) was gradually implemented from 2000 onwards to give the general public the conditional right to walk in certain areas of the English and Welsh countryside: principally [[downland]], [[moorland]], [[heathland]] and coastal land. Forests and woodlands are excluded, other than  publicly owned forests, which have a similar right of access by virtue of a voluntary dedication made by the [[Forestry Commission]]. Developed land, gardens and certain other areas are specifically excluded from the right of access. Agricultural land is accessible if it falls within one of the categories described above. People exercising the right of access have certain duties to respect other people's rights to manage the land, and to protect nature.\n\nThe new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales, with completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced. Traditionally the public could walk on established [[Footpath (right of way)|public footpaths]] and [[bridleways]], on [[common land]] and on the [[foreshore]], and land owners could prevent access to other areas (or charge a fee for access).\n\nAngling interests successfully lobbied for the exclusion of rivers in England and Wales from CROW, leaving other river users such as [[swimmer]]s and [[canoeing|canoeists]] with access restricted to less than 2% of navigable water. The [[British Canoe Union]] is running the [[Rivers Access Campaign]], to highlight the level of restrictions the public face in gaining access to inland waterways in England and Wales.\n\nMuch of the [[Dartmoor National Park]] has been designated as 'Access Land', although it remains privately owned, since the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985, with no restrictions on where walkers can roam.<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/localact1985/pdf/ukla_19850037_en.pdf Dartmoor Commons Act 1985] on the OPSI website</ref> Because of the 1985 Act, Dartmoor was largely unaffected by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which established similar rights in other rural parts of the country, but in 2006, this Act opened up much of the remaining restricted land to walkers.\n\n==== Scotland ====\nIn Scotland the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] comprehensively codified into [[Scots law]] the ancient tradition of the right to universal access to the land in Scotland.  The act specifically establishes a right to be on land for recreational, educational and certain other purposes and a right to cross land. The rights exist only if they are exercised responsibly, as specified in the [[Scottish Outdoor Access Code]].\n\nAccess rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming.\nThe rights confirmed in the Scottish legislation are greater than the limited rights of access created in England and Wales by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/bill/factsheet/index.htm#1 |title=Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000: Fact Sheets |date=2000-03-07 |publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813102505/http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/bill/factsheet/index.htm#1 |archive-date=2006-08-13 |access-date=2006-12-09}}</ref>\n\n====Northern Ireland====\nAccess rights in Northern Ireland have been described as being \"the most regressive and restrictive access legislation in Europe.

It is the sequel to the 2001 game ''[[Toki Tori]]''. The game was originally announced in December 2011 with an intended release for Spring 2012 for [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[iOS]] devices (and was later announced as a [[Wii U]] game), but the game was pushed back due to longer than expected development times.

These are replaced by two skills that Toki Tori has during the game that are used to manipulate the environment and the creatures within it, the first one being Whistle which generally causes creatures to move closer to Toki Tori as well as being used to whistle songs that perform various actions. The other ability available to Toki Tori is Stomp. Stomp generally scares creatures into moving away from Toki Tori as well as breaking some parts of the environment. There are also other elements that make up the game, for example if Toki Tori walks into water his feathers will become wet which can then be used for other tasks such as walking through cut grass while wet will cause it to grow so it can be used.[[File:Toki Tori 2.jpg|thumb|left|Toki Tori 2+ ingame screenshot]]\n\nThe game also features various features that are new to the series, one of these features being the Tokidex. The Tokidex is one of the collectables in the game, as the game is played the player can use a song to bring up the camera which is controlled via the Wii U controller (or through the keyboard on the computer version). This camera is then used to take pictures of the creatures that appear in the world, the player is rewarded for collecting pictures of every creature in the game.\n\n==Development==\nBefore the game was announced it was hinted at numerous times by Two Tribes, the main example of this was a [[QR Code]] that could be found in the Windows/Mac port of ''[[Edge (video game)|Edge]]'' which led to a countdown timer, when this countdown timer ended it changed to show a picture of a buried Toki Tori skeleton with a hole in the ground next to it.<ref>Toki Tori 2 Dig Picture http://www.twotribes.com/09d6ee2cea36f247/</ref> After the countdown ended, Toki Tori 2 was announced shortly after.\n\nWhen the game was announced was when work was started on the game and at this point Two Tribes invited fans to become part of the development process by providing access to an alpha build of the game through Steam, this started off as a concept art viewer but as new features for the game were created they were implemented into the alpha, such as the level editor.

It served a large and relatively prosperous middle-class membership.

Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n== Prime Minister (1990\u20131997) ==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n== Final years in Parliament (1997\u20132001) ==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters.

The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier.

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1990 to 1997. Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n== Prime Minister (1990\u20131997) ==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister.

The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office. When he declared to the House of Commons in November 1993 that \"to sit down and talk with [[Gerry Adams|Mr Adams]] and the Provisional IRA&nbsp;... would turn my stomach\",<ref>{{cite Hansard|title=European Council (Special Meeting)|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1993-11-01/Debate-2.html|date=1 November 1993|column=34|house=House of Commons}}</ref> [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] gave the media an outline of the secret talks indeed held regularly since that February. The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire. Major paved the way for the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the 'Belfast Agreement', which was signed after he left office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Good-Friday-Agreement |title=Good Friday Agreement |encyclopedia= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= 15 April 2019}}</ref>\nIn March 1995, Major refused to answer the phone calls of United States President [[Bill Clinton]] for several days because of his anger at Clinton's decision to invite Gerry Adams to the [[White House]] for [[Saint Patrick's Day|St Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1243638,00.html|title='Mandela helped me survive Monicagate, Arafat could not make the leap to peace&nbsp;\u2013 and for days John Major wouldn't take my calls'|work=The Guardian |location=London | date= 21 June 2004 | accessdate=17 September 2006 | first=Alan | last=Rusbridger}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nFrom 1994 to 1997, Major [[privatisation of British Rail|privatised British Rail]], splitting it up into [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|franchises to be run by the private sector]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=12| title=Railways Act 1993| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1903| website=The Railways Archive| publisher=originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office| accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref> The process was controversial at the time, and the [[Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|effect of privatising the railway]] is still disputed, with large growth in passenger numbers and increasing efficiency matched by large public subsidy<ref>{{cite news|title= Have train fares gone up or down since British Rail?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21056703|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=22 January 2013|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/regulation-industry/what-would-we-consider-a-successful-railway-system|title=What would we consider a successful railway system?|last=Southwood|first=Ben|date=19 August 2014|publisher=[[Adam Smith Institute]]|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and concern about foreign companies running British railways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/revealed-how-the-world-gets-rich-from-privatising-british-public-services-9874048.html|title=Revealed: How the world gets rich \u2013 from privatising British public services|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate= 30 December 2015|date=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===\"Sleaze\"===\nAt the 1993 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Conference, Major began the \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" campaign, which he intended to also be about a wide variety of issues including the economy, education and policing, but which was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) purely in the context of returning to the moral and [[family values]] that they associated with the Conservative Party.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=403\u201308}}\n\nInstead of being well received, \"Back to Basics\" instead became synonymous with scandal, often exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail by [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n== Final years in Parliament (1997\u20132001) ==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].

Russia sought to cross Poland in order to stimulate a Europe-wide communist revolution.\n\nPoland's [[Chief of State]], [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], felt the time was right to expand Polish borders as far east as feasible, to be followed by a Polish-led [[Intermarium]] federation of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states, as a bulwark against the re-emergence of German and Russian [[imperialism]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] saw Poland as the bridge the [[Red Army]] had to cross to assist [[Communism|other Communist movements]] and bring about more European revolutions. By 1919, Polish forces had taken control of much of [[Western Ukraine]], emerging victorious from the [[Polish\u2013Ukrainian War]]. The [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], led by [[Yevhen Petrushevych]], had tried to create a Ukrainian state on territories to which both Poles and Ukrainians laid claim. In the Russian part of Ukraine [[Symon Petliura]] tried to defend and strengthen the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] but as the [[Bolsheviks]] began to win the [[Russian Civil War]], they started to advance westward towards the disputed Ukrainian territories, causing Petliura's forces to retreat to [[Podolia]]. By the end of 1919, a clear front had formed as Petliura decided to ally with Pi\u0142sudski. Border skirmishes escalated following Pi\u0142sudski's [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|Kiev Offensive]] in April 1920.\n\nThe Polish offensive was met by a successful Red Army [[counter-attack]]. The Soviet operation pushed the Polish forces back westward all the way to the Polish capital, [[Warsaw]], while the [[Directorate of Ukraine]] fled to Western Europe. Western fears of Soviet troops arriving at the German frontiers [[Interallied Mission to Poland|increased the interest of Western powers]] in the war. In mid-summer, the fall of Warsaw seemed certain but in mid-August, the tide had turned again, as the Polish forces achieved an unexpected and decisive victory at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]]. In the wake of the Polish advance eastward, the Soviets sued for peace and the war ended with a [[cease-fire]] on 18 October 1920.\n\nThe [[Peace of Riga]] was signed on 18 March 1921, dividing the disputed territories between Poland and Soviet Russia. The war largely determined the Soviet\u2013Polish border for the [[Interbellum]]. Poland gained a territory of around 200 kilometers east of its former border, the [[Curzon Line]], which had been defined by an international commission after [[World War I]].<ref>{{citation|surname1=Norman Davies|title=Heart of Europe.

The ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' begins its article with the date range 1919\u20131920 but then states, \"Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state J\u00f3zef Pilsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura (21 April 1920) and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on 7 May.\"<ref group=\"N\" name=\"brit_ruspol\"/> The Polish encyclopaedia [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN]],<ref name=\"pwn_polbol\"/> as well as Western historians such as [[Norman Davies]], consider 1919 the starting year of the war.<ref name=\"davies_WERS_22\"/>\n\nThe ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the [[cease-fire]] was put into force on 18 October 1920, the [[Treaty of Riga|official treaty ending the war]] was signed months later, on 18 March 1921. While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict, and only in early 1920 did both sides engage in all-out war, the conflicts that took place in 1920 were an inevitable escalation of fighting that began in earnest a year earlier. In the end, the events of 1920 were a logical, though unforeseen, consequence of the 1919 prelude.<ref name=\"davies_WERS_22\"/>\n\n== Prelude ==\n{{Main|Causes of the Polish\u2013Soviet War}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 3.png|thumb|[[Partitions of Poland]] in 1795: The coloured territories show the extent of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] just before the first partition.

After a period of internecine wars and the Mongolian invasion of 1240, these lands became objects of expansion for the Kingdom of Poland and for the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the first half of the 14th century, the [[Kievan Rus'|Grand Duchy of Kiev]] and land between the [[Dnieper]], [[Pripyat River|Pripyat]], and [[Daugava (river)|Daugava (Western Dvina)]] rivers became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and in 1352 Poland and Lithuania divided the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]] between themselves. In 1569, in accordance with the terms of the [[Union of Lublin]] between Poland and Lithuania, some of the Ukrainian lands passed to the Polish Crown. Between 1772 and 1795, much of the Eastern Slavic territories became part of the [[Russian Empire]] in the course of the [[Partitions of Poland]].

Revolutionary Russia, meanwhile, focused on thwarting counter-revolution and the [[Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War|intervention by the Allied powers]] (1918 to 1925).

Lenin also spotted the use of Russian patriotism. Thus, the Central Committee appealed to the \"respected citizens of Russia\" to defend the Soviet republic against a Polish usurpation. Russia's counter-offensive was indeed boosted by Brusilov's engagement; 14,000 officers and over 100,000 deserters enlisted in or returned to the Red Army, and thousands of civilian volunteers contributed to the effort.<ref name=\"A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891\u20131924\" /> The commander of the Polish 3rd Army in Ukraine, General [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]], decided to break through the Soviet line toward the north-west.

The 4th, 15th, and 3rd Armies were to push west, supported from the south by the [[Western Army (Russia)|16th Army]] and Mozyr Group. For three days the outcome of the battle hung in the balance, but Soviet numerical superiority proved decisive and by 7 July Polish forces were in full retreat along the entire front. However, due to the stubborn defence by Polish units, Tukhachevsky's plan to break through the front and push the defenders south-west into the [[Pinsk Marshes]] failed.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\" />\n[[File:Cooper Fauntleroy.jpg|thumb|left|American volunteer pilots, [[Merian C.

However, the Polish troops were insufficient in number. Soviet forces found a weakly defended part of the front and broke through. Gaj-Chan and Lithuanian forces captured Vilnius on 14 July, forcing the Poles into retreat again. In [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] to the south, General [[Semyon Budyonny]]'s cavalry advanced far into the Polish rear, capturing [[Brody]] and approaching [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]] and [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]].

It faced the combined forces of the numerically and materially superior Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies. In one day the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and [[Modlin (Nowy Dw\u00f3r Mazowiecki)|Modlin]] had been halted and soon turned into retreat. Sikorski's 5th Army pushed the exhausted Soviet formations away from Warsaw in a lightning operation. Polish forces advanced at a speed of thirty kilometers a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their enveloping manoeuvre in the north. By 16 August, the Polish [[Battle of D\u0119blin and Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki|counter-offensive]] had been fully joined by Marshal Pi\u0142sudski's \"Reserve Army.\" Precisely executing his plan, the Polish force, [[Battle of D\u0119blin and Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki|advancing]] from Warsaw (Colonel Wrzali\u0144ski's group) and the south (Polish 3rd and 4 Army), found a huge gap between the Soviet fronts and exploited the weakness of the Soviet \"Mozyr Group\" that was supposed to protect the weak link between the Soviet fronts. The Poles continued their northward offensive with two armies following and destroying the surprised enemy. They reached the rear of Tukhachevsky's forces, the majority of which were encircled by 18 August. Only that same day did Tukhachevsky, at his [[Minsk]] headquarters 480 kilometres (300 mi) east of Warsaw, become fully aware of the proportions of the Soviet defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. He hoped to straighten his front line, halt the Polish attack, and regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\n\nSoviet armies in the centre of the front fell into chaos. Tukhachevsky ordered a general retreat toward the [[Bug River]], but by then he had lost contact with most of his forces near Warsaw, and all the Bolshevik plans had been thrown into disarray by communication failures.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\n\nBolshevik armies retreated in a disorganised fashion; entire divisions panicking and disintegrating.

We could and should take advantage of the military situation to begin an offensive war... we should poke about with bayonets to see whether the socialist revolution of the proletariat had not ripened in Poland... that somewhere near Warsaw lies not [only] the center of the Polish bourgeois government and the republic of capital, but the center of the whole contemporary system of international imperialism, and that circumstances enabled us to shake that system, and to conduct politics not in Poland but in Germany and England. In this manner, in Germany and England we created a completely new zone of proletarian revolution against global imperialism... By destroying the Polish army we are destroying the Versailles Treaty on which nowadays the entire system of international relations is based.....Had Poland become Soviet....the Versailles Treaty ...and with it the whole international system arising from the victories over Germany, would have been destroyed.\"<br />English translation quoted from [[Richard Pipes]], Russia under the Bolshevik Regime, New York, 1993, pp.181\u2013182, with some stylistic modification in par 3, line 3, by A.

Russia sought to cross Poland in order to stimulate a Europe-wide communist revolution.\n\nPoland's [[Chief of State]], [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], felt the time was right to expand Polish borders as far east as feasible, to be followed by a Polish-led [[Intermarium]] federation of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states, as a bulwark against the re-emergence of German and Russian [[imperialism]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] saw Poland as the bridge the [[Red Army]] had to cross to assist [[Communism|other Communist movements]] and bring about more European revolutions. By 1919, Polish forces had taken control of much of [[Western Ukraine]], emerging victorious from the [[Polish\u2013Ukrainian War]]. The [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], led by [[Yevhen Petrushevych]], had tried to create a Ukrainian state on territories to which both Poles and Ukrainians laid claim. In the Russian part of Ukraine [[Symon Petliura]] tried to defend and strengthen the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] but as the [[Bolsheviks]] began to win the [[Russian Civil War]], they started to advance westward towards the disputed Ukrainian territories, causing Petliura's forces to retreat to [[Podolia]]. By the end of 1919, a clear front had formed as Petliura decided to ally with Pi\u0142sudski. Border skirmishes escalated following Pi\u0142sudski's [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|Kiev Offensive]] in April 1920.\n\nThe Polish offensive was met by a successful Red Army [[counter-attack]]. The Soviet operation pushed the Polish forces back westward all the way to the Polish capital, [[Warsaw]], while the [[Directorate of Ukraine]] fled to Western Europe. Western fears of Soviet troops arriving at the German frontiers [[Interallied Mission to Poland|increased the interest of Western powers]] in the war. In mid-summer, the fall of Warsaw seemed certain but in mid-August, the tide had turned again, as the Polish forces achieved an unexpected and decisive victory at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]]. In the wake of the Polish advance eastward, the Soviets sued for peace and the war ended with a [[cease-fire]] on 18 October 1920.\n\nThe [[Peace of Riga]] was signed on 18 March 1921, dividing the disputed territories between Poland and Soviet Russia. The war largely determined the Soviet\u2013Polish border for the [[Interbellum]]. Poland gained a territory of around 200 kilometers east of its former border, the [[Curzon Line]], which had been defined by an international commission after [[World War I]].<ref>{{citation|surname1=Norman Davies|title=Heart of Europe.

The ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' begins its article with the date range 1919\u20131920 but then states, \"Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state J\u00f3zef Pilsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura (21 April 1920) and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on 7 May.\"<ref group=\"N\" name=\"brit_ruspol\"/> The Polish encyclopaedia [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN]],<ref name=\"pwn_polbol\"/> as well as Western historians such as [[Norman Davies]], consider 1919 the starting year of the war.<ref name=\"davies_WERS_22\"/>\n\nThe ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the [[cease-fire]] was put into force on 18 October 1920, the [[Treaty of Riga|official treaty ending the war]] was signed months later, on 18 March 1921. While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict, and only in early 1920 did both sides engage in all-out war, the conflicts that took place in 1920 were an inevitable escalation of fighting that began in earnest a year earlier. In the end, the events of 1920 were a logical, though unforeseen, consequence of the 1919 prelude.<ref name=\"davies_WERS_22\"/>\n\n== Prelude ==\n{{Main|Causes of the Polish\u2013Soviet War}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 3.png|thumb|[[Partitions of Poland]] in 1795: The coloured territories show the extent of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] just before the first partition.

After a period of internecine wars and the Mongolian invasion of 1240, these lands became objects of expansion for the Kingdom of Poland and for the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the first half of the 14th century, the [[Kievan Rus'|Grand Duchy of Kiev]] and land between the [[Dnieper]], [[Pripyat River|Pripyat]], and [[Daugava (river)|Daugava (Western Dvina)]] rivers became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and in 1352 Poland and Lithuania divided the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]] between themselves. In 1569, in accordance with the terms of the [[Union of Lublin]] between Poland and Lithuania, some of the Ukrainian lands passed to the Polish Crown. Between 1772 and 1795, much of the Eastern Slavic territories became part of the [[Russian Empire]] in the course of the [[Partitions of Poland]]. After the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814\u20131815, much of the territory of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] (Poland) transferred into Russian control.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}\"\u0421\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e \u044f\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0443\u0449\u0435\u0440\u0431 \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u041f\u043e\u0434\u043b\u044f\u0445\u0438\u044e, \u0412\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d\u044c \u0438 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435\", \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435\u0432 \u0421. \"\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\", {{ISBN|978-5-17-002142-0}}, \u0442.6, \u0441\u0441.814\u2013815</ref> After young Poles refused to be [[conscription|conscripted]] into the [[Imperial Russian Army]] during the [[January Uprising|uprising in Poland in 1863]], Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] stripped Poland of its separate constitution, forced Russian to be the only language spoken, took away vast tracts of land from Poles, and incorporated Poland directly into Russia by dividing it into ten provinces, each with an appointed Russian military governor and all under complete control of the Russian Governor-General at Warsaw.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wandycz | first = Piotr S. | title = The lands of partitioned Poland, 1795\u20131918 | publisher = University of Washington Press | chapter = Part Two: The Age of Insurrections, 1830\u201364 | year = 1974 | isbn = 9780295953588}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2013-01-23|script-title=ru:\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a: '\u0412 1863 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0431\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0443 \u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044e \u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f' |trans-title=Historian: 'In 1863, Belarusians did not support Poland and Kalinowski, but Russia and its sovereign' |language=ru |website=regnum.by |url=http://www.regnum.by/news/1616548.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927112842/http://www.regnum.by/news/1616548.html |archive-date=2013-09-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs [[aftermath of World War I|World War I ended]] (1918), the map of [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe changed drastically.<ref name=\"fraser_1996-2\"/> Germany's defeat rendered Berlin's plans for the creation of Eastern European [[puppet state]]s ([[Mitteleuropa]]), [[Kingdom of Poland (1916-1918)|including one in Poland]], obsolete.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jukes|Simkins|Hickey|2002|pp=84,85}}</ref> The Russian Empire collapsed, resulting in the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=\"goldstein_1992-51\"/> of 1917\u20131922.

Revolutionary Russia, meanwhile, focused on thwarting counter-revolution and the [[Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War|intervention by the Allied powers]] (1918 to 1925).

It faced the combined forces of the numerically and materially superior Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies. In one day the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and [[Modlin (Nowy Dw\u00f3r Mazowiecki)|Modlin]] had been halted and soon turned into retreat. Sikorski's 5th Army pushed the exhausted Soviet formations away from Warsaw in a lightning operation. Polish forces advanced at a speed of thirty kilometers a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their enveloping manoeuvre in the north. By 16 August, the Polish [[Battle of D\u0119blin and Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki|counter-offensive]] had been fully joined by Marshal Pi\u0142sudski's \"Reserve Army.\" Precisely executing his plan, the Polish force, [[Battle of D\u0119blin and Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki|advancing]] from Warsaw (Colonel Wrzali\u0144ski's group) and the south (Polish 3rd and 4 Army), found a huge gap between the Soviet fronts and exploited the weakness of the Soviet \"Mozyr Group\" that was supposed to protect the weak link between the Soviet fronts. The Poles continued their northward offensive with two armies following and destroying the surprised enemy. They reached the rear of Tukhachevsky's forces, the majority of which were encircled by 18 August. Only that same day did Tukhachevsky, at his [[Minsk]] headquarters 480 kilometres (300 mi) east of Warsaw, become fully aware of the proportions of the Soviet defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. He hoped to straighten his front line, halt the Polish attack, and regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\n\nSoviet armies in the centre of the front fell into chaos.

We could and should take advantage of the military situation to begin an offensive war... we should poke about with bayonets to see whether the socialist revolution of the proletariat had not ripened in Poland... that somewhere near Warsaw lies not [only] the center of the Polish bourgeois government and the republic of capital, but the center of the whole contemporary system of international imperialism, and that circumstances enabled us to shake that system, and to conduct politics not in Poland but in Germany and England. In this manner, in Germany and England we created a completely new zone of proletarian revolution against global imperialism... By destroying the Polish army we are destroying the Versailles Treaty on which nowadays the entire system of international relations is based.....Had Poland become Soviet....the Versailles Treaty ...and with it the whole international system arising from the victories over Germany, would have been destroyed.\"<br />English translation quoted from [[Richard Pipes]], Russia under the Bolshevik Regime, New York, 1993, pp.181\u2013182, with some stylistic modification in par 3, line 3, by A.
