{"title_page": "Abortion in New Jersey", "text_new": "'''[[Abortion]] in New Jersey''' is legal.  Abortion related laws were drafted by the legislature by the end of the 1900s.\u00a0 These laws would be addressed in court during the 1800s as they related to application in prosecutions of women for having abortions. During the 1940s, hospitals created committees to approve abortion requests with the goal of trying to reduce the number of abortions performed at them.\n\n<br />\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{Main|Abortion}}{{See also|Definitions of abortion}}The abortion debate most commonly relates to the \"[[induced abortion]]\" of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense.<ref group=\"note\">According to the Supreme Court's decision in ''Roe v. Wade'':<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgement of the pregnant woman's attending physician. (b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. (c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgement, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>Likewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as \"knowing destruction\" or \"intentional expulsion or removal\".</ref> Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before viability at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Katie|date=20 Dec 2019|title=Why We Should Stop Using the Term \"Elective Abortion\"|url=https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/why-we-should-stop-using-term-elective-abortion/2018-12|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics|doi=10.1001/amajethics.2018.1175|accessdate=17 May 2019|pmid=30585581|volume=20|pages=E1175-1180|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-abortion movement|Anti-abortion]] advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\",<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Pam|last2=Hardisty|first2=Jean|year=2007|title=The Importance of the Political 'Framing' of Abortion|url=http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v14n1/ReproPatriarch-07.html|journal=The Public Eye Magazine|volume=14|issue=1}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/weekinreview/05greenhouse.html?scp=1&sq=infanticide \"The Roberts Court Takes on Abortion\".] ''New York Times.''

The number of people living in the borough in 1900 was 4,451; in 1910, 8,166; in 1940, 13,017; and in 2000, 8,998.  The population was 8,338 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Of the four communities in the United States named \"Lewistown\", this borough is the largest.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Monument Square, Lewistown, Pennsylvania (1913).jpg|thumb|right|Monument Square in Lewistown, 1913]]\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe borough was incorporated in 1795 and was named for William \"Bill\" Lewis, a [[Quaker]] and a member of the legislature, who was responsible for the designation of the borough, which was then known as the Village of Ohesson, as the county seat of Mifflin County.\n\nDuring the late 19th century Mifflin County became the crossroads of the Commonwealth. Located near the geographic center of the state, the area became a hub for traffic moving in every direction.\n\nEarly roads crisscrossed the region, but it was the eventual construction of the [[Pennsylvania Canal]] and the railroads that followed that truly positioned Mifflin County as an economic force in the state.\n\nLewistown, as the major city in Mifflin County, saw its economy expand dramatically as entrepreneurs launched companies to construct canal boats or build inns offering lodging for travelers and workers.\n\nAt its zenith, Mifflin County was one of the busiest centers for cargo and passenger traffic in the United States. But with the demise of the canal system, Mifflin County eventually lost its place as a major transportation hub.\n\n=== American Civil War ===\nOn April 16, 1861, Lewistown sent its Logan Guards, a militia group originally formed in 1858, to Washington, D.C. for its defense. They were one of only five companies, all recruited in Pennsylvania, to share the honor of being the first U.S. troops sent to the capital. Monument Square, situated at the intersection of Main and Market Streets in Lewistown, serves as a memorial to these men.\n\n=== Tropical Storm Agnes ===\nLewistown lost its role as a major transportation hub, but still boasted a strong industrial economy until the early 1970s when the county's industries began a slow decline. [[Hurricane Agnes]] June 1972 crippled the local economy.\n\nOn June 19, Hurricane Agnes made initial landfall along the [[Florida Panhandle]] as a weak Category 1 [[Hurricane]]. Agnes then proceeded through [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]] before she moved back over the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] off the North Carolina coast on June 21.\n\nAfter regaining strength over the Atlantic, she made landfall again over southeastern [[New York (state)|New York]] on June 22 and moved westward in an arc over southern New York into north-central Pennsylvania. She became nearly stationary over Pennsylvania by morning of June 23, but was soon absorbed by a low-pressure system that slowly drifted northeastward from Pennsylvania into New York.\n\nRainfall from storm over the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic region]] ranged from {{convert|2|to|3|in|mm}} in the extreme upper basins of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and North Branch [[Susquehanna River]]s to {{convert|18|in|mm}} near [[Shamokin, Pennsylvania]], in the Main Stem Susquehanna River basin. An average of {{convert|6|to|10|in|mm}} of rain fell over the Mid-Atlantic region. The soil, already well watered by spring rains, could not absorb so much water so quickly.\n\nWhile flooding from the [[Juniata River]] was somewhat controlled due to a dam at [[Raystown Lake]], {{convert|44|mi|km}} west of Lewistown, the county experienced extensive flooding from the river and major streams which resulted in the permanent closure of many businesses along the river. Most notably, the flood submerged much of the [[American Viscose Corporation]] plant, then a division of FMC Corporation. The facility, located on the banks of the Juniata River across from Lewistown proper, manufactured rayon fiber (primarily for rayon-belted automobile tires), polyester and Avistrap.\n\nFMC was one of two major employers in the area at the time, the other being the Standard Steel Works. The \"Viscose\" plant was only marginally profitable before the storm and the cost to reopen was prohibitive. (Ironically, the demand for rayon fabric for trendy clothing shot upward only a few years later.) Rayon production, and with it, thousands of good-paying jobs, moved to another FMC plant in Front Royal, Virginia. The Lewistown polyester plant reopened, but it rehired only a fraction of the previous workforce. The site eventually became the Mifflin County Industrial Plaza and a variety of businesses have come and gone since then.\n\nIn the wake of the failure of Lewistown's industry, a long period of decline began that continues to this day. The 1990s saw the loss of several plants, including Masland and Lear, as well as Standard Steel filing for reorganization bankruptcy. In its place, like so many other towns throughout the US, was a dark period of rampant drug usage by significant portions of the population. In 2001, MSNBC ran a documentary called 'Along Comes the Horse,' which used Lewistown as the rural focus of the ongoing heroin epidemic in the USA.\n\n=== Economic Downturn ===\nThe early 2000s saw the loss of Scottys Fashions, Mann Edge Tool, Overhead Door shuttering its Sectional division, Ford New Holland shuttered its Belleville plant which also led to the closing of the Belleville Foundry, and the shrinking Lewistown Hospital was purchased by Geisinger Health, which expanded services, such as helicopter transfers to other Geisinger facilities who were more capable of taking in specialized care.\nToday, many new industries and services are located in the Juniata River Valley including Nittany Paper Mills, Meeker, First Quality and Primary Health Network. Philips Ultrasound is continually expanding its facility and its workforce to meet demand.\n\n=== Present day ===\nLewistown received the prestigious [[All-American City]] award in 1973 for its rebuilding process following the disaster.\n\nTwo positives in the years since Agnes was the 2011 purchase of Standard Steel by the Japanese company Sumitomo Industries, who merged with and is now known as Nippon Steel, which effectively saved the jobs of 500  union laborers as well as many others, and the opening of First Quality, an adult incontinence products manufacturing facility that employees approximately 400 people.\nGeisinger purchased Lewistown Hospital and expanded services including a helicopter pad, the Geisinger LIFE program and a new clinic coming to Reedsville.\n\nLewistown is home to the Pennsylvania State Fire School, which is the only such facility in the state. Firefighting in Lewistown is very important, as volunteer firefighters have strong allegiance to the multiple independent fire companies in the borough to which they devote their time.\n\nToday, Lewistown is seeing a boom in new businesses by young entrepreneurs including a coffee shop, restaurants, screenprinter and a book store.  The construction of a new highway system between Lewistown and State College is underway and will hopefully connect the two communities upon completion.\n\nThe [[Embassy Theatre (Lewistown, Pennsylvania)|Embassy Theatre]], [[McCoy House (Lewistown, Pennsylvania)|McCoy House]], [[Mifflin County Courthouse]], [[Montgomery Ward Building (Lewistown, Pennsylvania)|Montgomery Ward Building]], and [[Wollner Building]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|2.0|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n== Water source ==\nThe source of the borough's city water comes from the Laurel Creek Reservoir, which is located in Seven Mountains going towards State College.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{US Census population\n|1800= 523\n|1810= 474\n|1820= 773\n|1830= 1479\n|1840= 2058\n|1850= 2733\n|1860= 2638\n|1870= 2737\n|1880= 3222\n|1890= 3273\n|1900= 4451\n|1910= 8166\n|1920= 9849\n|1930= 13357\n|1940= 13017\n|1950= 13894\n|1960= 12640\n|1970= 11098\n|1980= 9830\n|1990= 9341\n|2000= 8998\n|2010= 8338\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8156\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Pennsylvania|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/17216604v1p40ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-40.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HQu4Spqa?url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=17 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2010, there were 8,338 people, 3,742 households, and 2,030 families residing in the borough. The [[population density]] was 4,138.7 people per square mile (1,598.0/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 4,345 housing units at an average density of 2,156.7 per square mile (832.7/km<sup>2</sup>). The racial makeup of the borough was 95.2% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 1.5% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black or African American]], 0.3% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.3% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.9% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.8% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 3.1% of the population.\n\nThere were 3,742 households, out of which 27.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.8% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 4.8% had a male householder with no wife present, 14.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.8% were non-families. 39.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 17.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.21, and the average family size was 2.93.\n\nIn the borough, the population was spread out, with 23.3% under the age of 18, 8.6% from 18 to 24, 25.3% from 25 to 44, 26.6% from 45 to 64, and 16.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.3 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $26,584, and the median income for a family was $38,356.  The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $16,447. About 22.8% of families and 27.4% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 47.0% of those under age 18 and 13.6% of those age 65 or over.\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Ralph Baker (linebacker)|Ralph Baker]], professional American football player\n* [[Carl Barger]], attorney and baseball executive\n* [[Frances McEwen Belford]], \"Mother of the [[Lincoln Highway]]\"\n* [[Joseph Campanella]], actor\n* [[Laura M.

Though geographically closer to the [[Maryland]] city of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], the residents are almost equally divided in supporting the Pennsylvania professional sports teams from [[Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh]]. At the college level, with State College being located about {{convert|30|mi|km}} northwest of Lewistown, a good percentage of the town support the [[Penn State Nittany Lions]]. People of Lewistown also support youth sports. The area hosts a youth soccer tournament called [[Clash of the Cleats]]. The tournament attracts youth soccer clubs throughout Pennsylvania, and now is starting to attract teams from neighboring states. The [[Little League]], [[Babe Ruth Baseball|Babe Ruth]], and [[American Legion baseball]] teams grace the front pages of the local newspaper throughout the summer. And in the fall, the youth football programs spark rivalries between the smaller communities that surround Lewistown.\n\n=== High school sports ===\n[[Image:Iron Kettle 2005.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The 2005 \"Iron Kettle Game\" between Lewistown (blue) and Indian Valley (white). Photo by Frank DiGiorgino]]\n\n=== Mifflin County Huskies ===\nAs of June 2011, the Mifflin County School District voted to merge its two high schools, [[Lewistown Area High School]] and neighboring Indian Valley High School (itself a merger of Chief Logan and Kishacoquillas high schools) to form Mifflin County High School due to increasing costs, declining enrollment, and lack of revenues from the state level.  This is the second time the school district chose to create a single high school for the county.  The first attempt at a combined high school only lasted for three years in the 1970s before district officials broke up the school due to public pressure.  Mifflin County will compete at the [[PIAA]] District 6, Class AAAA level but compete in the Mid-Penn Conference due to a lack of AAAA schools in District 6.  The newly created school will bear the nickname of \"Huskies\" and sport purple, silver and black as its colors.\n\n=== Lewistown Panthers ===\nFrom September 1976 to June 2011, Lewistown Area High School, nicknamed the [[black panther|Panthers]], competed in PIAA District 6, at the Class AAA level. The Panthers won PIAA Championships in Baseball in 2002 and Girls\u2019 Basketball in 1997 and 1998. In fact, in 1997 Lewistown Area High joined a very small list of Pennsylvania schools to have both their Girls\u2019 and Boys\u2019 basketball teams reach the state championship game in the same season.  The Lady Panther basketball was consistently ranked among the Top 10 teams in the state. Lewistown had an excellent [[scholastic wrestling|wrestling]] program, with the 2006 squad finishing 8th in the state.\n\nIn the 2007 baseball season, the Panthers finished the regular season with a 9\u20139 record. The Panthers went on to win three straight district playoff games to earn the 2007 district championship while defeating cross town rival Indian Valley in the process. The team went on to lose in the state quarterfinals to eventual AAA State Champion Punxsutawny.\n\n==== Old Iron Kettle ====\n\nThe \"Old Iron Kettle\" is a black Kettle trophy that was awarded to the winner of the annual [[American Football|football]] game between Lewistown and its rival school Chief Logan until its closing in 1989 at which time the rivalry shifted to [[Indian Valley]]. Played for the final time on October 22, 2010, the game was won by Indian Valley for the fifth consecutive year. The schools subsequently merged to become the Mifflin County High School Huskies.\n\n==== Other sports ====\n\n[[Auto racing]], [[sprint car racing]] along with wrestling are popular as well as outdoor activities such as [[hunting]] and [[fishing]].\n\n== Transportation ==\n* [[Lewistown (Amtrak station)]]\n* Greyhound\n* Fullington Trailways\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Newspapers ===\n* [http://www.lewistownsentinel.com/ Lewistown Sentinel]\n\n=== Television stations ===\n\n* WHTM 27 Harrisburg (27.1 ABC, 27.2 ION, 27.3 GetTV, 27.4 Laff)\n* WPMT 43 York (43.1 FOX, 43.2 AntennaTV)\n* WHP 21 Harrisburg (21.1 CBS, 21.2 MyNetworkTV, 21.3 CW)\n* WGAL 8 Lancaster (8.1 NBC, 8.2 MeTV)\n* WTAJ 10 Altoona (10.1 CBS, 10.2 Escape, 10.3 Laff, 10.4 Grit)\n* WHVL 29 State College (29.1 MyNetworkTV, 29.2 Buzzr)\n\n=== Radio stations ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 | [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations\n|-\n| '''Call letters''' || '''Frequency''' || '''Format''' || '''Location''' || '''Owner'''\n|-\n| WRYV || 88.7 || Christian Contemporary || Milroy || Invisible Allies \n|-\n| WTLR || 89.9 || Religious || State College || Central Pennsylvania Christian Institute\n|-\n| WJRC || 90.9 || Christian Contemporary || Lewistown || Salt and Light Media Ministries, Inc.\n|-\n| WIBF || 92.5 || Country || Mexico || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|-\n| WBUS || 93.7 || Classic Rock || Boalsburg || Forever Broadcasting\n|-\n| WQKX || 94.1 || CHR || Sunbury || Sunbury Broadcasting Corporation\n|-\n| WMRF || 95.7 || Hot AC || Lewistown || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|-\n| WVNW || 96.7 || Country || Burnham || WVNW, Inc.\n|-\n| WFGY || 98.1 || Country || Altoona || Forever Broadcasting\n|-\n| WMAJ || 99.5 || Hot AC || Centre Hall || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|-\n| W262DO || 100.3 || Oldies/Sports || Lewistown || WVNW, Inc.\n|-\n| WFGE || 101.1 || Country || Tyrone || Forever Broadcasting\n|-\n| WCHX || 105.5 || Classic Rock || Burnham || Mifflin County Communications, Inc.\n|-\n| WQCK || 105.9 || Rock || State College || Magnum Broadcasting\n|-\n| WDBF || 106.3 || Country || Mount Union || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|-\n| WQJU || 107.1 || Religious || Mifflintown || Central Pennsylvania Christian Institute\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 | [[AM broadcasting|AM]] stations\n|-\n| '''Call letters''' || '''Frequency''' || '''Format''' || '''Location''' || '''Owner'''\n|-\n| WLUI || 670 || News/Talk || Lewistown || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|-\n| WKVA || 920 || Oldies/Sports || Burnham|| WVNW, Inc.\n|-\n| WHUN || 1150 || News/Talk || Huntingdon || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|-\n| WJUN || 1220 || Sports || Mexico || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|}\n\n=== Cable television ===\nLewistown was one of the first three communities that formed the cable company later known as [[Cox Communications]]\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Borough of Lewistown is served by the [[Mifflin County School District]].

Continuing Education pulled out of the Learning Center following the Spring 2017 semester, with the goal converting CE students to Penn State World Campus students.  Harrisburg Area Community College(HACC)has taken over the former Penn State CE health and science lab and other classroom space to offer face-to-face for-credit courses, capturing many former Penn State CE students.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Indian Valley High School (Pennsylvania)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Lewistown, Pennsylvania}}\n{{Collier's

}}</ref> It is the principal city of the ''[[Lewistown, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area]]'', which encompasses all of Mifflin County.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/List5.txt 1]</ref> It lies along the [[Juniata River]], {{convert|61|mi|km}} northwest of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]].  The number of people living in the borough in 1900 was 4,451; in 1910, 8,166; in 1940, 13,017; and in 2000, 8,998.  The population was 8,338 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Of the four communities in the United States named \"Lewistown\", this borough is the largest.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Monument Square, Lewistown, Pennsylvania (1913).jpg|thumb|right|Monument Square in Lewistown, 1913]]\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe borough was incorporated in 1795 and was named for William \"Bill\" Lewis, a [[Quaker]] and a member of the legislature, who was responsible for the designation of the borough, which was then known as the Village of Ohesson, as the county seat of Mifflin County.\n\nDuring the late 19th century Mifflin County became the crossroads of the Commonwealth. Located near the geographic center of the state, the area became a hub for traffic moving in every direction.\n\nEarly roads crisscrossed the region, but it was the eventual construction of the [[Pennsylvania Canal]] and the railroads that followed that truly positioned Mifflin County as an economic force in the state.\n\nLewistown, as the major city in Mifflin County, saw its economy expand dramatically as entrepreneurs launched companies to construct canal boats or build inns offering lodging for travelers and workers.\n\nAt its zenith, Mifflin County was one of the busiest centers for cargo and passenger traffic in the United States. But with the demise of the canal system, Mifflin County eventually lost its place as a major transportation hub.\n\n=== American Civil War ===\nOn April 16, 1861, Lewistown sent its Logan Guards, a militia group originally formed in 1858, to Washington, D.C. for its defense. They were one of only five companies, all recruited in Pennsylvania, to share the honor of being the first U.S. troops sent to the capital. Monument Square, situated at the intersection of Main and Market Streets in Lewistown, serves as a memorial to these men.\n\n=== Tropical Storm Agnes ===\nLewistown lost its role as a major transportation hub, but still boasted a strong industrial economy until the early 1970s when the county's industries began a slow decline. [[Hurricane Agnes]] June 1972 crippled the local economy.\n\nOn June 19, Hurricane Agnes made initial landfall along the [[Florida Panhandle]] as a weak Category 1 [[Hurricane]]. Agnes then proceeded through [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]] before she moved back over the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] off the North Carolina coast on June 21.\n\nAfter regaining strength over the Atlantic, she made landfall again over southeastern [[New York (state)|New York]] on June 22 and moved westward in an arc over southern New York into north-central Pennsylvania. She became nearly stationary over Pennsylvania by morning of June 23, but was soon absorbed by a low-pressure system that slowly drifted northeastward from Pennsylvania into New York.\n\nRainfall from storm over the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic region]] ranged from {{convert|2|to|3|in|mm}} in the extreme upper basins of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and North Branch [[Susquehanna River]]s to {{convert|18|in|mm}} near [[Shamokin, Pennsylvania]], in the Main Stem Susquehanna River basin. An average of {{convert|6|to|10|in|mm}} of rain fell over the Mid-Atlantic region. The soil, already well watered by spring rains, could not absorb so much water so quickly.\n\nWhile flooding from the [[Juniata River]] was somewhat controlled due to a dam at [[Raystown Lake]], {{convert|44|mi|km}} west of Lewistown, the county experienced extensive flooding from the river and major streams which resulted in the permanent closure of many businesses along the river. Most notably, the flood submerged much of the [[American Viscose Corporation]] plant, then a division of FMC Corporation. The facility, located on the banks of the Juniata River across from Lewistown proper, manufactured rayon fiber (primarily for rayon-belted automobile tires), polyester and Avistrap.\n\nFMC was one of two major employers in the area at the time, the other being the Standard Steel Works. The \"Viscose\" plant was only marginally profitable before the storm and the cost to reopen was prohibitive. (Ironically, the demand for rayon fabric for trendy clothing shot upward only a few years later.) Rayon production, and with it, thousands of good-paying jobs, moved to another FMC plant in Front Royal, Virginia. The Lewistown polyester plant reopened, but it rehired only a fraction of the previous workforce. The site eventually became the Mifflin County Industrial Plaza and a variety of businesses have come and gone since then.\n\nIn the wake of the failure of Lewistown's industry, a long period of decline began that continues to this day. The 1990s saw the loss of several plants, including Masland and Lear, as well as Standard Steel filing for reorganization bankruptcy. In its place, like so many other towns throughout the US, was a dark period of rampant drug usage by significant portions of the population. In 2001, MSNBC ran a documentary called 'Along Comes the Horse,' which used Lewistown as the rural focus of the ongoing heroin epidemic in the USA. \n\n=== Economic Downturn ===\nThe early 2000s saw the loss of Scottys Fashions, Mann Edge Tool, Overhead Door shuttering its Sectional division, Ford New Holland shuttered its Belleville plant which also led to the closing of the Belleville Foundry, and the shrinking Lewistown Hospital was purchased by Geisinger Health, which expanded services, such as helicopter transfers to other Geisinger facilities who were more capable of taking in specialized care.\nToday, many new industries and services are located in the Juniata River Valley including Nittany Paper Mills, Meeker, First Quality and Primary Health Network. Philips Ultrasound is continually expanding its facility and its workforce to meet demand.\n\n=== Present day ===\nLewistown received the prestigious [[All-American City]] award in 1973 for its rebuilding process following the disaster.\n\nTwo positives in the years since Agnes was the 2011 purchase of Standard Steel by the Japanese company Sumitomo Industries, who merged with and is now known as Nippon Steel, which effectively saved the jobs of 500  union laborers as well as many others, and the opening of First Quality, an adult incontinence products manufacturing facility that employees approximately 400 people.\nGeisinger purchased Lewistown Hospital and expanded services including a helicopter pad, the Geisinger LIFE program and a new clinic coming to Reedsville.\n\nLewistown is home to the Pennsylvania State Fire School, which is the only such facility in the state. Firefighting in Lewistown is very important, as volunteer firefighters have strong allegiance to the multiple independent fire companies in the borough to which they devote their time.\n\nToday, Lewistown is seeing a boom in new businesses by young entrepreneurs including a coffee shop, restaurants, screenprinter and a book store.  The construction of a new highway system between Lewistown and State College is underway and will hopefully connect the two communities upon completion.\n\nThe [[Embassy Theatre (Lewistown, Pennsylvania)|Embassy Theatre]], [[McCoy House (Lewistown, Pennsylvania)|McCoy House]], [[Mifflin County Courthouse]], [[Montgomery Ward Building (Lewistown, Pennsylvania)|Montgomery Ward Building]], and [[Wollner Building]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|2.0|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n== Water source ==\nThe source of the borough's city water comes from the Laurel Creek Reservoir, which is located in Seven Mountains going towards State College.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{US Census population\n|1800= 523\n|1810= 474\n|1820= 773\n|1830= 1479\n|1840= 2058\n|1850= 2733\n|1860= 2638\n|1870= 2737\n|1880= 3222\n|1890= 3273\n|1900= 4451\n|1910= 8166\n|1920= 9849\n|1930= 13357\n|1940= 13017\n|1950= 13894\n|1960= 12640\n|1970= 11098\n|1980= 9830\n|1990= 9341\n|2000= 8998\n|2010= 8338\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8156\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Pennsylvania|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/17216604v1p40ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-40.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HQu4Spqa?url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=17 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2010, there were 8,338 people, 3,742 households, and 2,030 families residing in the borough. The [[population density]] was 4,138.7 people per square mile (1,598.0/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 4,345 housing units at an average density of 2,156.7 per square mile (832.7/km<sup>2</sup>). The racial makeup of the borough was 95.2% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 1.5% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black or African American]], 0.3% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.3% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.9% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.8% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 3.1% of the population.\n\nThere were 3,742 households, out of which 27.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.8% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 4.8% had a male householder with no wife present, 14.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.8% were non-families. 39.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 17.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.21, and the average family size was 2.93.\n\nIn the borough, the population was spread out, with 23.3% under the age of 18, 8.6% from 18 to 24, 25.3% from 25 to 44, 26.6% from 45 to 64, and 16.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.3 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $26,584, and the median income for a family was $38,356.  The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $16,447. About 22.8% of families and 27.4% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 47.0% of those under age 18 and 13.6% of those age 65 or over.\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Ralph Baker (linebacker)|Ralph Baker]], professional American football player\n* [[Carl Barger]], attorney and baseball executive\n* [[Frances McEwen Belford]], \"Mother of the [[Lincoln Highway]]\"\n* [[Joseph Campanella]], actor\n* [[Laura M.

Though geographically closer to the [[Maryland]] city of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], the residents are almost equally divided in supporting the Pennsylvania professional sports teams from [[Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh]]. At the college level, with State College being located about {{convert|30|mi|km}} northwest of Lewistown, a good percentage of the town support the [[Penn State Nittany Lions]]. People of Lewistown also support youth sports. The area hosts a youth soccer tournament called [[Clash of the Cleats]]. The tournament attracts youth soccer clubs throughout Pennsylvania, and now is starting to attract teams from neighboring states. The [[Little League]], [[Babe Ruth Baseball|Babe Ruth]], and [[American Legion baseball]] teams grace the front pages of the local newspaper throughout the summer. And in the fall, the youth football programs spark rivalries between the smaller communities that surround Lewistown.\n\n=== High school sports ===\n[[Image:Iron Kettle 2005.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The 2005 \"Iron Kettle Game\" between Lewistown (blue) and Indian Valley (white). Photo by Frank DiGiorgino]]\n\n=== Mifflin County Huskies ===\nAs of June 2011, the Mifflin County School District voted to merge its two high schools, [[Lewistown Area High School]] and neighboring Indian Valley High School (itself a merger of Chief Logan and Kishacoquillas high schools) to form Mifflin County High School due to increasing costs, declining enrollment, and lack of revenues from the state level.  This is the second time the school district chose to create a single high school for the county.  The first attempt at a combined high school only lasted for three years in the 1970s before district officials broke up the school due to public pressure.  Mifflin County will compete at the [[PIAA]] District 6, Class AAAA level but compete in the Mid-Penn Conference due to a lack of AAAA schools in District 6.  The newly created school will bear the nickname of \"Huskies\" and sport purple, silver and black as its colors.\n\n=== Lewistown Panthers ===\nFrom September 1976 to June 2011, Lewistown Area High School, nicknamed the [[black panther|Panthers]], competed in PIAA District 6, at the Class AAA level. The Panthers won PIAA Championships in Baseball in 2002 and Girls\u2019 Basketball in 1997 and 1998. In fact, in 1997 Lewistown Area High joined a very small list of Pennsylvania schools to have both their Girls\u2019 and Boys\u2019 basketball teams reach the state championship game in the same season.  The Lady Panther basketball was consistently ranked among the Top 10 teams in the state. Lewistown had an excellent [[scholastic wrestling|wrestling]] program, with the 2006 squad finishing 8th in the state.\n\nIn the 2007 baseball season, the Panthers finished the regular season with a 9\u20139 record. The Panthers went on to win three straight district playoff games to earn the 2007 district championship while defeating cross town rival Indian Valley in the process. The team went on to lose in the state quarterfinals to eventual AAA State Champion Punxsutawny.\n\n==== Old Iron Kettle ====\n\nThe \"Old Iron Kettle\" is a black Kettle trophy that was awarded to the winner of the annual [[American Football|football]] game between Lewistown and its rival school Chief Logan until its closing in 1989 at which time the rivalry shifted to [[Indian Valley]]. Played for the final time on October 22, 2010, the game was won by Indian Valley for the fifth consecutive year. The schools subsequently merged to become the Mifflin County High School Huskies.\n\n==== Other sports ====\n\n[[Auto racing]], [[sprint car racing]] along with wrestling are popular as well as outdoor activities such as [[hunting]] and [[fishing]].\n\n== Transportation ==\n* [[Lewistown (Amtrak station)]]\n* Greyhound\n* Fullington Trailways\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Newspapers ===\n* [http://www.lewistownsentinel.com/ Lewistown Sentinel]\n\n=== Television stations ===\n\n* WHTM 27 Harrisburg (27.1 ABC, 27.2 ION, 27.3 GetTV, 27.4 Laff)\n* WPMT 43 York (43.1 FOX, 43.2 AntennaTV)\n* WHP 21 Harrisburg (21.1 CBS, 21.2 MyNetworkTV, 21.3 CW)\n* WGAL 8 Lancaster (8.1 NBC, 8.2 MeTV)\n* WTAJ 10 Altoona (10.1 CBS, 10.2 Escape, 10.3 Laff, 10.4 Grit)\n* WHVL 29 State College (29.1 MyNetworkTV, 29.2 Buzzr)\n\n=== Radio stations ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 | [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations\n|-\n| '''Call letters''' || '''Frequency''' || '''Format''' || '''Location''' || '''Owner'''\n|-\n| WRYV || 88.7 || Christian Contemporary || Milroy || Invisible Allies \n|-\n| WTLR || 89.9 || Religious || State College || Central Pennsylvania Christian Institute\n|-\n| WJRC || 90.9 || Christian Contemporary || Lewistown || Salt and Light Media Ministries, Inc.\n|-\n| WIBF || 92.5 || Country || Mexico || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|-\n| WBUS || 93.7 || Classic Rock || Boalsburg || Forever Broadcasting\n|-\n| WQKX || 94.1 || CHR || Sunbury || Sunbury Broadcasting Corporation\n|-\n| WMRF || 95.7 || Hot AC || Lewistown || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|-\n| WVNW || 96.7 || Country || Burnham || WVNW, Inc.\n|-\n| WFGY || 98.1 || Country || Altoona || Forever Broadcasting\n|-\n| WMAJ || 99.5 || Hot AC || Centre Hall || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|-\n| W262DO || 100.3 || Oldies/Sports || Lewistown || WVNW, Inc.\n|-\n| WFGE || 101.1 || Country || Tyrone || Forever Broadcasting\n|-\n| WCHX || 105.5 || Classic Rock || Burnham || Mifflin County Communications, Inc.\n|-\n| WQCK || 105.9 || Rock || State College || Magnum Broadcasting\n|-\n| WDBF || 106.3 || Country || Mount Union || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|-\n| WQJU || 107.1 || Religious || Mifflintown || Central Pennsylvania Christian Institute\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 | [[AM broadcasting|AM]] stations\n|-\n| '''Call letters''' || '''Frequency''' || '''Format''' || '''Location''' || '''Owner'''\n|-\n| WLUI || 670 || News/Talk || Lewistown || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|-\n| WKVA || 920 || Oldies/Sports || Burnham|| WVNW, Inc.\n|-\n| WHUN || 1150 || News/Talk || Huntingdon || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|-\n| WJUN || 1220 || Sports || Mexico || Seven Mountains Media (Kristin Cantrell)\n|}\n\n=== Cable television ===\nLewistown was one of the first three communities that formed the cable company later known as [[Cox Communications]]\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Borough of Lewistown is served by the [[Mifflin County School District]].

Continuing Education pulled out of the Learning Center following the Spring 2017 semester, with the goal converting CE students to Penn State World Campus students.  Harrisburg Area Community College(HACC)has taken over the former Penn State CE health and science lab and other classroom space to offer face-to-face for-credit courses, capturing many former Penn State CE students.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Indian Valley High School (Pennsylvania)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Lewistown, Pennsylvania}}\n{{Collier's Poster|Lewistown}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051215041625/http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/PA_Env-Her/hurricane_agnes_1972.htm PA Department of Environmental Protection Hurricane Agnes site]\n* [http://www.downtownlewistown.com Downtown Lewistown official site]\n* [http://VisitingMifflinCounty.com VisitingMifflinCounty.com], local community website for the county.\n* [http://www.juniatarivervalley.org JuniataRiverValley.org], visitor bureau.\n* {{Cite NIE|wstitle=Lewistown |short=x}}\n\n{{Geographic Location\n | Centre    = Lewistown\n | North     = [[Lock Haven, Pennsylvania|Lock Haven]]\n | Northeast = [[Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania|Selinsgrove]]\n | East      = [[Mifflintown, Pennsylvania|Mifflintown]]\n | Southeast = [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]\n | South     = [[Shippensburg, Pennsylvania|Shippensburg]]\n | West      = [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania|Huntingdon]]\n | Northwest = [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania|Bellefonte]]\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Articles Relating to Lewistown, Pennsylvania\n|list=\n{{Mifflin County, Pennsylvania}}\n{{County Seats of Pennsylvania}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:County seats in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1790]]\n[[Category:Boroughs in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:1795 establishments in Pennsylvania]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewistown,_Pennsylvania"}

These settlements were among the first Quaker settlements in America west of the [[Susquehanna River]].  Among the group of original titleholders along the small creek that would become known as Bennett Run were Ellis Lewis, Joseph Bennett, John Rankin, John Heald, and John Hall.  At this time, the area that would become York County was still almost entirely populated by the Susquehannock Indians. Yet there are few recorded conflicts between these early settlers and the native population.  In this area that would later become majority [[Pennsylvania German]], the first and second waves of settlers were almost entirely English speakers and included the Kirks, Rankins, Huttons, Garetsons, Nebingers, Eppleys, Starrs, Fosters, Clines, Stromingers, Moores, Frankelbergers, Suttons, Wickershams, Prowells, Millers, and Hammonds.  While most were Quakers, a significant minority were [[Anglican]]s.  The Quaker meeting house at the intersection of Old Quaker and Lewisberry roads ([[Pennsylvania Route 382|PA 382]]) is the original Quaker meeting house in the area.\n\n===Founding of borough===\n[[File:Lewisberry Keystone sign.JPG |thumb|upright=1.3|Lewisberry's [[Keystone Marker]]]]\nThe borough's founder, Eli Lewis, was born nearby in 1750, the son of one of the original settlers, Ellis Lewis.  On the eve of the [[American Revolution]], Eli opened a store on the site of the current borough.  Lewis and members of other prominent families in the area served in the Pennsylvania militia, and Eli rose to the rank of major.  Over the course of the war, the town became known for producing guns, and the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] for York County contracted with area gunsmiths to supply the [[Continental Army]]; guns made in Lewisberry were in use by the US Army as late as the [[Siege of Veracruz]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] of 1846.  Following the Revolutionary War, Lewis' fortune grew (and he eventually owned 850 acres in the area) and his store was the center of commerce in the Redland Valley.  In 1798, Issac Kirk surveyed twelve acres of land and laid out lots for Lewis, who wanted a town to exist on the site.  While all of the lots were not immediately sold, many were, and the town began a modest growth.  Between 1790 and 1798, Major Lewis had lived in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], where he took up printing and published the first Harrisburg newspaper, ''The Advertiser'', which was then sold to [[John Wyeth]], who renamed it ''The Oracle of [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin]]''.  While living in Harrisburg, Lewis also published the popular poem, \"St. Clair's Defeat,\" which described the defeat of [[Arthur St. Clair]] by the tribes of the [[Western Confederacy]] during the [[St. Clair's Defeat|Battle of the Wabash]].\n\n===Incorporation and growth===\nLewisberry was not incorporated until 1832, fifty years later, and the first census figures of 1840 show a population of 220.  In 1800, Henry Ensminger opened a large [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] just south of town that was later owned and operated by Samuel Grove.  More significant for the town's growth was John Herman, who built a large flour mill on the west side of the borough. But the town's most successful operator was Andrew Cline, who ran a large and successful milling business during the second half of the 19th century.  The mill and house are still standing just outside the borough beside Silver Lake, which was created to power the mill.  One of Lewisberry's most important small industries during the 19th and early 20th centuries was the manufacture of block [[sulfur|brimstone]] matches, and the families of Lyman Lewis, Herman Kirk, Moses Magrew, Rt. Starr, and Lyman Shettle became prosperous through this industry.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Joseph Potts manufactured the area's first [[coffee mill]]s out of his home.  This industry grew under his children, and by the middle of the century, Lewisberry was producing large numbers of coffee grinders in a small factory near the Quaker meeting house.  In 1835, William Smith started a newspaper in the bustling town.  In 1837, Lewisberry native Hervey Hammond began manufacture of the patented Hammond [[window sash]] spring, and in 1838, President [[Martin Van Buren]] installed Hammond springs in all of the [[White House]]'s windows.<ref>Prowell, George R.

The [[population density]] was 2,892.4 people per square mile (1,143.5/km\u00b2). There were 150 housing units at an average density of 1,126.9 per square mile (445.5/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the borough was 97.40% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 1.82% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.26% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.26% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.26% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 2.60% of the population.\n\nThere were 146 households out of which 43.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.4% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.5% were non-families. 26.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 3.16.\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out with 30.4% under the age of 18, 6.0% from 18 to 24, 40.3% from 25 to 44, 13.2% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females there were 98.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.4 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the borough was $49,844, and the median income for a family was $58,125. Males had a median income of $31,667 versus $27,250 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the borough was $16,147. About 4.5% of families and 3.9% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 3.5% of those under age 18 and 18.2% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Gravity Hill==\n\nThe intersection of [[Pennsylvania Route 177]] and Pleasant View Road near the borough is said to allow an automobile in neutral to drift uphill.  According to legend, this effect is caused by the ghosts of children once killed in a bus accident, who push the car uphill to prevent similar occurrences.<ref>http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/1113</ref> However, the phenomenon is caused by a [[gravity hill]] optical illusion.\n\n==Little League World Series==\nIn 2015, the Red Land Little League from Lewisberry participated in the [[2015 Little League World Series|Little League World Series]], winning the U.S. Championship and finishing as runner-up to Japan in the world championship game.

The [[population density]] was 2,892.4 people per square mile (1,143.5/km\u00b2). There were 150 housing units at an average density of 1,126.9 per square mile (445.5/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the borough was 97.40% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 1.82% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.26% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.26% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.26% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 2.60% of the population.\n\nThere were 146 households out of which 43.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.4% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.5% were non-families. 26.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 3.16.\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out with 30.4% under the age of 18, 6.0% from 18 to 24, 40.3% from 25 to 44, 13.2% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% who were 65 years of age or older.

According to legend, this effect is caused by the ghosts of children once killed in a bus accident, who push the car uphill to prevent similar occurrences.<ref>http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/1113</ref> However, the phenomenon is caused by a [[gravity hill]] optical illusion.\n\n==Little League World Series==\nIn 2015, the Red Land Little League from Lewisberry participated in the [[2015 Little League World Series|Little League World Series]], winning the U.S. Championship and finishing as runner-up to Japan in the world championship game.  It was the first appearance for a Pennsylvania team in the final game since [[1990 Little League World Series|1990]] when the Shippensburg Little League Team was defeated by the San Hua Little League Team of [[Tainan, Taiwan]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://lewisberryborough.org/ Borough of Lewisberry official website]\n{{York County, Pennsylvania}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1784]]\n[[Category:Boroughs in York County, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:1784 establishments in Pennsylvania]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewisberry,_Pennsylvania"}

His roommate, Trimagasi, explains that they are in a tower-style facility in which food is delivered via a platform that travels from the top, stopping for a fixed period on each floor. Those on lower levels are able to eat only what those at the top leave them, and they cannot hoard food (the cell is heated or cooled to fatal levels if food is kept). Every month, people are randomly reassigned to a new level. Each resident is allowed to bring one item in with them, Goreng choosing a copy of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and Trimagasi a self-sharpening knife called the Samurai Plus. \n\nOne day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform, and Trimagasi explains that she descends the pit every month in search of her child. Goreng sees her being attacked by the two people on the level below, and he considers jumping down to help her, but she kills them both and rides the platform down again.\n\nAs they talk, it is revealed that Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the \"Vertical Self-Management Center\" in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi is serving a year-long sentence for manslaughter. Over the month, they become friendly, but on the day of the room shuffle, Goreng wakes up tied to the bed. They have been reassigned to level 171, where the platform is expected to be empty of food when it arrives. Trimagasi explains that he plans to cut strips of Goreng's flesh to sustain them both, but only in moderate amounts so he doesn't bleed out. On the eighth day, Trimagasi cuts into Goreng's leg but is attacked by Miharu as she comes down the platform. She frees Goreng and he kills Trimagasi. Miharu cuts some of Trimagasi's flesh, feeding Goreng and eating some herself before continuing down.\n\nThe following month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman, Imoguiri, as a cellmate. The only thing she brought with her was her dog. Goreng recognizes her as the Administration official who interviewed him before sending him to the cells. She tells Goreng that she believes there are 200 floors. She says she was unaware of the horrible conditions and volunteered to try to fix things when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri rations her food and attempts to convince those below to do so as well, but they ignore her until Goreng threatens to defecate in their food.\n\nGoreng encounters Miharu once again as she rides down on the platform but she appears critically injured, presumably from being in a fight on the higher levels. Goreng and Imoguiri grab her off the platform and tend to her wounds. Goreng explains to Imoguiri about Miharu's search for her child, but Imoguiri says nobody under the age of 16 is allowed into the facility and says Miharu entered alone. \n\nGoreng awakens to see Miharu and Imoguiri in a standoff, as Miharu has eaten Imoguiri's dog.  Goreng awakens the following month on level 202 and finds that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh to survive, experiencing hallucinations of her and Trimagasi instructing him to do so. He then awakens the following month on level 6. His roommate, Baharat, attempts to climb up through the upper level with the help of those above using a rope he brought into the pit. The couple living on the level above first help him, but end up defecating in his face, and pushing him back down. Estimating that there are around 250 levels, Goreng makes a plan to ride the platform down, rationing the food so all get a share, and convinces Baharat to go with him.\n\nAs they descend, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. Going down, they encounter Miharu fighting two other residents and try to help her, but she is killed, and both men are injured. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend, eventually passing level 250 and reaching level 333 where the platform stops. Goreng notices a child hiding under the bed, and assumes it is Miharu's son. He gets off the platform, followed hesitantly by Baharat, only to have the platform continue downward, leaving them behind. They then discover the child is actually a girl, who turns out to be Miharu's  daughter. Despite Baharat's reluctance, they feed her an untouched [[panna cotta]] they had been saving as a \"message\" for the Administrators at the top. \n\nGoreng passes out and dreams of Baharat telling him that \"the girl is the message.\" The next day, Goreng finds Baharat dead after succumbing to his injuries, and takes the child with him when the platform arrives; they descend to the bottom of the pit where he once again sees Trimagasi, who tells him that \"the message requires no bearer.\" Goreng gets off the platform and walks away with Trimagasi, both turning to watch as the girl is transported upwards.\n\n== Cast==\n[[File:El hoyo prentsaurrekoa rueda de prensa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cast and crew members at a press conference in October 2019.]]\n* [[Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9]] as ''Goreng'', named after ''[[:wiktionary:goreng|gor\u00e8ng]]'', which means \"fried\" in Malay/Indonesian.\n* Zorion Eguileor ([[:eu:Zorion_Egileor|eu]]) as ''Trimagasi'', named after terima kasih, which stands for \"thank you\" in Malay/Indonesian language\n* [[Antonia San Juan]] as ''Imoguiri'', named after ''[[Imogiri]]'', a royal graveyard in Indonesia. \n* [[Emilio Buale Coka]] as ''Baharat'', named after ''[[baharat]]'', a spice blend used in Turkish and Greek cuisine.\n* Alexandra Masangkay as ''Miharu'' \n* Eric L.

That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]].

The ''rosanero'' ended the season in first place, being crowned Serie B champions and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Summary==\nAmbitious Palermo failed to gain promotion to [[Serie A]] in the previous season following a 3-0 away defeat in the final match against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], which were promoted at Palermo's place<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914131104/http://www.ilpalermocalcio.it/it/0304/numeri.jsp|title= Season 2002-30 Palermo |publisher=ilpalermocalcio.it|language=Italian}}</ref>. That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=2|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Cotroneo|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''3''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Francesco Modesto]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\">Ceduto durante la sessione invernale di calciomercato.</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=4|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=5|nat=ITA|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=6|nat=ITA|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=7|nat=ITA|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=8|nat=ITA|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=9|nat=ITA|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=10|nat=ITA|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=11|nat=ITA|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=12|nat=ITA|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=13|nat=ITA|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''14''|nat=CMR|name=''[[Frank Oliver Ongfiang]]''<ref>Ceduto a stagione iniziata.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=14|nat=ITA|name=Rocco D'Aiello|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=16|nat=ITA|name=Pietro Balistreri|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=17|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''18''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Franco Brienza]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\"/>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=18|nat=ITA|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\">Acquistato durante la sessione invernale di calciomercato</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=19|nat=ITA|name=Daniele Zito|pos=DF}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=20|nat=ITA|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''21''|nat=ROU|name=''[[Paul Codrea]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=21|nat=ITA|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=22|nat=ITA|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=''23''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Ighli Vannucchi]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=23|nat=ITA|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=24|nat=NGA|name=John Olufemi|pos=A}}\n{{fs player|no=25|nat=SLE|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=26|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=27|nat=ITA|name=Michele Trionfante|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=29|nat=ROU|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=30|nat=BRA|name=[[Jeda]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=A}}\n{{fs player|no=32|nat=ITA|name=Marco Fina|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=46|nat=ITA|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=51|nat=ITA|name=Vincenzo Giannusa|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=79|nat=ITA|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=81|nat=ITA|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=82|nat=ITA|name=Nicola Milano|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=84|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Comi|pos=P}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n===Transfers===\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 50%;\">\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:99%;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |In\n|-\n! width=3% |Pos.\n! width=33% |Name\n! width=28% |from\n! width=36% |Type\n|-\n|GK ||[[Gianluca Berti]] ||Empoli ||\n|-\n|GK ||Paolo Comi ||Monza}} ||\n|-\n|DF ||[[Michele Ferri]] ||[[A.C.
