December 6, 1967), also known as the \"'''Tent Girl'''\", was notable as an unidentified homicide victim for nearly 30 years after her body was found on May 17, 1968 near [[Georgetown, Kentucky]]. She was referred to as \"Tent Girl\" because of material wrapped around her. On April 23, 1998, the Scott County Sheriff's Office announced that this victim had been identified. Hackmann Taylor, born in Illinois, was married and had an eight-month old daughter when she went missing from her home in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].\n\nHer late husband, George Earl Taylor, was a carnival worker and the prime suspect in the murder case. He did not file a missing person report but told her family that she had left him for another man. He died of cancer in October 1987. Because he was a prime suspect, Hackmann's family excluded his name when they commissioned a new tombstone for her gravesite. Giving her full name and dates, it was added beneath one identifying her as \"Tent Girl\" at her grave at the Georgetown Cemetery. She had been buried in 1971 by local authorities when her case was stalled.\n\n==History==\nWilbur Riddle, who had been scavenging for [[Insulator (electricity)#Telegraph and power transmission insulators|glass insulators]] alongside [[U.S. Route 25 in Kentucky|U.S. Route 25]] near Georgetown, Kentucky, on May 17, 1968, discovered a decomposing body wrapped in a heavy green canvas [[tarpaulin]]. It was material such as might be used to wrap up a tent. A police investigation failed to identify the deceased woman, or to name any suspects in her apparent murder, despite efforts to publicize her description and check reports of missing women.<ref name=\"Who\">\"Tent Girl.\" ''Who Killed Jane Doe?'', season 2, episode 1, [[Investigation Discovery]], 23 Jan. 2018.</ref>\n\nWith no new leads in the case, her remains were buried in 1971 in the [[Georgetown Cemetery (Georgetown, KY)|Georgetown Cemetery]].

It was the first [[garden city movement|garden city]] in Germany. The northern section of Hellerau absorbed the village of Klotzsche, where some 18th century buildings remain.\n\n==Origins==\n\nBased on the ideas of [[Ebenezer Howard]], businessman [[Karl Schmidt-Hellerau]] founded Hellerau near Dresden in 1909. The idea was to create an organic, [[planned community]]. Several well-known architects participated in its construction, including  [[Richard Riemerschmid]], [[Heinrich Tessenow]], [[Hermann Muthesius]], [[Kurt Frick]], [[Georg Metzendorf]], [[Wilhelm Kreis]] and [[Bruno Paul]].\n\nHellerau attracted cultural visionaries from all over Europe. Among them were [[\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze]], composer, and [[Mary Wigman]], choreographer. Until the start of [[World War I]] annual festivals attracted further members of the progressive elite of the time. In 1921 educator [[A. S. Neill]] founded his [[Summerhill School]] here. With the establishment of the National Socialist ([[Nazi]]) government in Germany in 1933, the progressive community at Hellerau ended.\n\n==Pattern==\n\nThe development lies on gently sloping ground and is laid out as a series of curvilinear streets, of an overall organic type form. Materials are typically cream rendered walls on a stone base, with red tile roofs and green windows (mainly with shutters). The landscape is dominated by tall conifers.\n\nThe Deutsche Werkstatten, a large factory involved in the production of craft furniture, played a central role in the function of the community, but geographically lies on its southern edge. Functionally this has been superseded by a modern facility further to the south.\n\nThe layout physically centres upon a small rectangular market square.\n\nBuildings are generally from one storey and attic to three storey, but all adopt a gentle cottage style. The exception to this is the large former water tower, now converted to housing use.\n\n==Festspielhaus==\n\nTo the north-west the Festspielhaus provides a cultural focus. This housed a Rhythmic Gymnastics centre during the [[Second World War]]. The central building here still holds some remnants of its communist past, when it served as a Russian barracks from 1945 until 1989. The building has been restored and is now a base for a dance company.\n\nSurrounding buildings are partly restored, with sections also hoped to create a base for resident artists. The community park surrounding the complex, Golgi Park, creates a multi-functional space serving the local community.\n\n==Notable residents==\n\n*[[Karl Schmidt-Hellerau]] (1873-1948) founder of the community\n*[[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]] (1865-1950) music teacher and composer\n*[[Richard Riemerschmid]] (1868-1957) architect\n\n==See also==\n*[[Festspielhaus Hellerau]]\n\n== References ==\n* [https://www.hellerau.org/en/ Official site]\n* Clemens Galonska, Frank Elstner: ''Gartenstadt Hellerau / Garden City of Hellerau''.
