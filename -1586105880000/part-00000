Originally, RBS's programming was composed of foreign programs from the [[United States]] and it later produced local programs to cater to Filipino audiences. It produced shows like ''Uncle Bob's Lucky Seven Club'', a child-oriented show aired every Saturdays; ''Dance Time with Chito''; and various news programs like ''[[News at Seven]]''. In 1963, RBS launched its first provincial television station in Cebu, [[DYSS-TV|DYSS Channel 7]] (now GMA Cebu). In the same year, from Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc, the firm was formally renamed to Republic Broadcasting System, Inc.

In December 1972, RBS was given the green light by the government to return on the air, however with limited three-month permits. Programming during that time was supplied mostly via a blocktime agreement with Philippine Production Center Inc. (PPCI), a company led by former ABS-CBN executive Romeo Jalosjos. But due to limited licenses, difficulty in financial obligations, and disallowing foreign citizens and entities from owning and operating media companies in the Philippines, Stewart and the [[American Broadcasting Company]], who owned a quarter of the company, was forced to cede majority control to a triumvirate composed of Gilberto Duavit Sr., a Malaca\u00f1ang official; Menardo Jimenez, an accountant; and Felipe Gozon, an attorney of the Stewarts in 1974; and the station changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts (GMA stood for [[Greater Manila Area]], the station's initial coverage area); though Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. remained as its corporate name until 1996.

Through the acquisition, the station was able to broadcast in color with a [[Philippine peso|\u20b1]]8 million credit line thru buying telecine machines and acquired foreign programs. Ratings were up from #5 to #3 that time.<ref name=\"Gozon\"/>\n\n===1980s===\nWhen [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino, Jr.]], a senator who strongly opposed the Marcos administration, was assassinated on August 21, 1983, it was only a small item on television news. The iron grip that the Marcos administration had on television began to slip, as GMA broadcast the funeral, the only local station to do so.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> In 1984, [[Imee Marcos]], daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, attempted to take over GMA.<ref name=\"ABC\"/><ref name=\"PinoyTV\"/> However, the takeover was prevented by GMA executives. Stewart left the Philippines for good as he was utterly disappointed with the Marcos move. GMA was also instrumental during the years preceding the [[1986 EDSA Revolution|People Power Revolution]]. The network was the first to air a television interview with [[Corazon Aquino]] via ''[[Viewpoint (Philippine TV series)|Viewpoint]]'' in 1984, and when she later announced that she would run for the presidency if she receives one million signatures.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> In February 1986, the network was also the first to report that [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] broke away from the Marcos administration.<ref name=\"ABC\"/>\n\nWhen democracy in the Philippines was restored in the People Power Revolution in 1986, television stations began to air, some with their original owners. The political instability of the country also added to the station's burden, when soldiers stormed into the studios for two days in a part of coup attempt to topple then president, Corazon Aquino. In 1987, it became the first VHF television network in the country to provide a new dimension to viewers by broadcasting the network's programs in full stereo (dubbed as ''GMA StereoVision''), it opened its high-end live studio, the Broadway Centrum, boosting its local programming, and inaugurated its 777-foot ''[[Tower of Power (transmitter)|Tower of Power]]'' located along Tandang Sora, [[Quezon City]], the tallest man-made structure in the country on November 7, 1988.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m6EVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jQsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6031%2C1257960 Pres.

A Franchise to Construct, Install, Operate and Maintain Radio and Television Broadcasting Stations in the Philippines,\" granting GMA a legislative franchise for the operation of radio and television broadcasting stations, in particular, \"to construct, install, operate and maintain for commercial purposes and in the public interest, radio and television broadcasting stations in the Philippines with the corresponding auxiliary, special broadcast and other program and distribution services and relay stations, and to install radio communications facilities for private use in its broadcast services\" for a period of 25 years.\n\nUnder Jimenez, Gozon and Executive Vice President Antonio C. Barreiro, international reach became GMA's target in the 1990s, which began when the ''Rainbow Satellite'' launched on April 26, 1992. Through its relay stations, GMA programs were seen across the archipelago and [[Southeast Asia]]. GMA programming started airing in 60 American cities and parts of [[South America]] through the ''International Channel Network''. GMA was the official broadcaster of the 1995 [[World Youth Day]], which was the last visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to the country. During the same year, two popular TV shows, ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' and ''[[Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!]]'' began broadcasting on GMA after [[TAPE Inc.]] refused [[ABS-CBN]]'s proposal to buy the airing rights of the two shows. At the same time, GMA launched a [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel subsidiary, [[DWDB-TV|Citynet 27]], several new shows (among them was [[Bubble Gang]] one of the longest-running shows on TV today), and the news program, ''[[Saksi]]'' with [[Mike Enriquez]], [[Mel Tiangco]] and [[Karen Davila]]. It also has the Asian adaptation of The 700 Club series as The 700 Club Asia which the Philippines is the only originating country in Asia.\n\nIn 1995, GMA founded its film production company, ''Cinemax Studios'' (later renamed to [[GMA Films]] in 1998) with the film ''[[Run Barbi Run]]''. Its film ''[[Jos\u00e9 Rizal (film)|Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'' released in 1998, which was at that time the most expensive movie production ever in the country (costing over 80 million pesos to produce), became a huge success with many accolades and award nominations.\n\nOn May 16, 1996, GMA formally changed its corporate name to ''GMA Network Incorporated'', with GMA now standing for ''Global Media Arts''.

Gozon, Gilberto Duavit, Jr., and Joel Marcelo Jimenez.\n\n==Branding==\n\n===Network identity===\nOn October 29, 1961, Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. launches its first television station in the Philippines, known back then as [[DZBB-TV|RBS TV Channel 7]]. GMA Network began branding its identity by eliminating call signs to its network identification.\n\n:*'''RBS TV Channel 7 (1961\u20131974)''' \u2013 From the success of its amplitude modulation band radio [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]], [[Robert Stewart (entrepreneur)|Robert La Rue \"Uncle Bob\" Stewart]] launches its first television and the Philippines third terrestrial channel, RBS TV Channel 7.\n:* '''GMA Radio-Television Arts (1974\u20131992)''' \u2013 To ascertain its presence in its coverage area, the Greater Manila Area, RBS changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts after the takeover by the new management.\n:* '''GMA Rainbow Satellite Network (Rainbow Network, 1992\u20131995)''' \u2013 When the network launched its satellite to widen its coverage area, GMA again rebranded its network identity on April 26, 1992.\n:* '''GMA Network (Rainbow Network, 1995\u20132002)''' \u2013 In preparation for the 45th year of responsible broadcasting, GMA Rainbow Satellite changed to GMA Network.\n:* '''GMA Network (Kapuso Network, 2002\u2013present)''' \u2013 On October 27, 2002, GMA Network unveiled its new identity and catchphrase. In an effort to localize and transform its image into a more intrinsic Filipino network, GMA Network engaged in a rebranding course.\n\n===Logos===\nGMA Network has used a number of logos throughout its history especially when Gozon, Jimenez, and Duavit acquired the station in 1975. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, the network used the [[Circle 7 logo]] for its Metro Manila and Cebu stations, which is also expended by several networks around the world (predominately the O&O stations of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States). In the 1980s, to refine its presence in the Philippine broadcast industry, GMA Network used the slogan ''Where You Belong'', and lasted for two decades before invigorating to another catchphrase. In 1992, GMA Network redefines itself as the '''Rainbow Network,''' succeeding the ensigns of the rainbow. Throughout the 1990s, the network developed the logo before having it replaced by its current logo in 2002 and as the '''Kapuso Network'''.<ref name=\"gmanetwork.com\"/> After a huge marketing campaign, and improved television ratings, the new insignia (the rainbow-colored stylized heart-shape logo known as '''''Kapuso''''') is now one of the most recognizable in the Philippines.\n\n===Slogans===\n'''''Kapuso ng Bawat Pilipino''''' ('''''One in Heart with Every Filipino''''')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/corporate/about|title=GMANetwork.com - Corporate - Official Corporate Website of the Kapuso Network|author=GMA New Media, Inc.|work=gmanetwork.com|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}</ref> is the secondary characteristic catchphrase of GMA Network.

GMA Network is the flagship property of publicly traded [[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network Inc.]] Its first broadcast on television was on October 29, 1961. GMA Network (formerly known as '''RBS TV Channel 7''', '''GMA Radio-Television Arts''' and '''GMA Rainbow Satellite Network''') is commonly referred to as the \"Kapuso Network\" in reference to the outline of the company's logo. It has also been called the \"Christian Network\", which refers to the apparent programming during the tenure of the new management, which took over in 1974. It is headquartered in the [[GMA Network Center]] in [[Quezon City]] and its transmitter, [[Tower of Power (transmitter)|Tower of Power]], is located at Tandang Sora Avenue, Barangay Culiat also in Quezon City.<ref name=\"gmanetwork.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com|title=GMANetwork.com - Online home of the Kapuso Network|author=GMA New Media, Inc.|work=gmanetwork.com}}</ref>\n\nThe original meaning of the GMA acronym was '''[[Greater Manila Area]]''', referring to the initial coverage area of the station. As the network expanded it changed into '''Global Media Arts'''. GMA's flagship [[television station]] is [[DZBB-TV]] which carries VHF Channel 7 (Analog broadcast) and UHF Channel 15 (Digital broadcast). The network has 4 originating stations and 48 relay stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through [[GMA Pinoy TV]], [[GMA Life TV]] and [[GMA News TV|GMA News TV International]].\n\n==History==\n===1950s and 1960s===\nThe origin of GMA Network can be traced back to Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. through [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]],<ref name=Origins>[http://www.gmanetwork.com/about GMA Network Corporate Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816053420/http://www.gmanetwork.com/about |date=August 16, 2008 }}, GMANetwork.com</ref> which started airing its radio broadcast on March 1, 1950, and officially launched as a local radio station in [[Manila]] on June 14, 1950 and owned by [[Robert Stewart (entrepreneur)|Robert La Rue \"Uncle Bob\" Stewart]], an American war correspondent.<ref name=\"ABC\">''GMA Gold: Fifty Years of Broadcast History'', Chelo Banal Formoso (ed.), GMA Network.</ref> Venturing into television in the 1960s, Stewart started RBS TV Channel 7 (under the call letters [[DZBB-TV]]) on October 29, 1961, becoming the Philippines' fifth terrestrial television station. Originally, RBS's programming was composed of foreign programs from the [[United States]] and it later produced local programs to cater to Filipino audiences. It produced shows like ''Uncle Bob's Lucky Seven Club'', a child-oriented show aired every Saturdays; ''Dance Time with Chito''; and various news programs like ''[[News at Seven]]''. In 1963, RBS launched its first provincial television station in Cebu, [[DYSS-TV|DYSS Channel 7]] (now GMA Cebu). In the same year, from Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc, the firm was formally renamed to Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. (RBS).<ref name=\"gmanetwork.com\"/>\n\n===1970s===\nOn September 21, 1972, then [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared [[Martial Law|martial law]] by the virtue of [[Proclamation No. 1081|Proclamation 1081]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906446,00.html|title=THE PHILIPPINES: Marcos' Martial Law|date=October 2, 1972|work=TIME.com}}</ref> Marcos, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties; closed down [[7th Congress of the Philippines|the Congress]] and media establishments including RBS. In December 1972, RBS was given the green light by the government to return on the air, however with limited three-month permits. Programming during that time was supplied mostly via a blocktime agreement with Philippine Production Center Inc. (PPCI), a company led by former ABS-CBN executive Romeo Jalosjos. But due to limited licenses, difficulty in financial obligations, and disallowing foreign citizens and entities from owning and operating media companies in the Philippines, Stewart and the [[American Broadcasting Company]], who owned a quarter of the company, was forced to cede majority control to a triumvirate composed of Gilberto Duavit Sr., a Malaca\u00f1ang official; Menardo Jimenez, an accountant; and Felipe Gozon, an attorney of the Stewarts in 1974; and the station changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts (GMA stood for [[Greater Manila Area]], the station's initial coverage area); though Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. remained as its corporate name until 1996. His wife Loring was the president when the takeover ensued.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/corporate/about/overview|title=GMANetwork.com - Corporate - Official Corporate Website of the Kapuso Network|date=|website=|publisher=GMA Network, Inc.|access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"PinoyTV\">''What's the story, Pinoy TV?'', Ellen Joy Anastacio and Janine Natalie Badiola, GMA Network.</ref><ref name=\"Gozon\">{{cite news|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/2014/12/05/henry-gozon-s-near-death-experience|title=Henry Gozon\u2019s near-death experience|author=''Tony Lopez''|newspaper=The Standard|accessdate=December 5, 2014}}</ref> The relaunched GMA, aside from sporting a light blue square logo with the network name in white, also (until 1980) had a [[circle 7 logo]] in use, in its final years the blue circle 7 logo used was similar to those used by the ABC in some United States cities.\n\nAfter that, Rod Reyes, the then-general manager of RBS recruited old-timers from ABS-CBN, including from the news department and entertainment programs. Through the acquisition, the station was able to broadcast in color with a [[Philippine peso|\u20b1]]8 million credit line thru buying telecine machines and acquired foreign programs. Ratings were up from #5 to #3 that time.<ref name=\"Gozon\"/>\n\n===1980s===\nWhen [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino, Jr.]], a senator who strongly opposed the Marcos administration, was assassinated on August 21, 1983, it was only a small item on television news. The iron grip that the Marcos administration had on television began to slip, as GMA broadcast the funeral, the only local station to do so.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> In 1984, [[Imee Marcos]], daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, attempted to take over GMA.<ref name=\"ABC\"/><ref name=\"PinoyTV\"/> However, the takeover was prevented by GMA executives. Stewart left the Philippines for good as he was utterly disappointed with the Marcos move. GMA was also instrumental during the years preceding the [[1986 EDSA Revolution|People Power Revolution]]. The network was the first to air a television interview with [[Corazon Aquino]] via ''[[Viewpoint (Philippine TV series)|Viewpoint]]'' in 1984, and when she later announced that she would run for the presidency if she receives one million signatures.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> In February 1986, the network was also the first to report that [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] broke away from the Marcos administration.<ref name=\"ABC\"/>\n\nWhen democracy in the Philippines was restored in the People Power Revolution in 1986, television stations began to air, some with their original owners. The political instability of the country also added to the station's burden, when soldiers stormed into the studios for two days in a part of coup attempt to topple then president, Corazon Aquino. In 1987, it became the first VHF television network in the country to provide a new dimension to viewers by broadcasting the network's programs in full stereo (dubbed as ''GMA StereoVision''), it opened its high-end live studio, the Broadway Centrum, boosting its local programming, and inaugurated its 777-foot ''[[Tower of Power (transmitter)|Tower of Power]]'' located along Tandang Sora, [[Quezon City]], the tallest man-made structure in the country on November 7, 1988.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m6EVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jQsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6031%2C1257960 Pres.

A Franchise to Construct, Install, Operate and Maintain Radio and Television Broadcasting Stations in the Philippines,\" granting GMA a legislative franchise for the operation of radio and television broadcasting stations, in particular, \"to construct, install, operate and maintain for commercial purposes and in the public interest, radio and television broadcasting stations in the Philippines with the corresponding auxiliary, special broadcast and other program and distribution services and relay stations, and to install radio communications facilities for private use in its broadcast services\" for a period of 25 years.\n\nUnder Jimenez, Gozon and Executive Vice President Antonio C. Barreiro, international reach became GMA's target in the 1990s, which began when the ''Rainbow Satellite'' launched on April 26, 1992. Through its relay stations, GMA programs were seen across the archipelago and [[Southeast Asia]]. GMA programming started airing in 60 American cities and parts of [[South America]] through the ''International Channel Network''. GMA was the official broadcaster of the 1995 [[World Youth Day]], which was the last visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to the country. During the same year, two popular TV shows, ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' and ''[[Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!]]'' began broadcasting on GMA after [[TAPE Inc.]] refused [[ABS-CBN]]'s proposal to buy the airing rights of the two shows. At the same time, GMA launched a [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel subsidiary, [[DWDB-TV|Citynet 27]], several new shows (among them was [[Bubble Gang]] one of the longest-running shows on TV today), and the news program, ''[[Saksi]]'' with [[Mike Enriquez]], [[Mel Tiangco]] and [[Karen Davila]]. It also has the Asian adaptation of The 700 Club series as The 700 Club Asia which the Philippines is the only originating country in Asia.\n\nIn 1995, GMA founded its film production company, ''Cinemax Studios'' (later renamed to [[GMA Films]] in 1998) with the film ''[[Run Barbi Run]]''. Its film ''[[Jos\u00e9 Rizal (film)|Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'' released in 1998, which was at that time the most expensive movie production ever in the country (costing over 80 million pesos to produce), became a huge success with many accolades and award nominations.\n\nOn May 16, 1996, GMA formally changed its corporate name to ''GMA Network Incorporated'', with GMA now standing for ''Global Media Arts''. [[GoBingo]], initially aired in 1996, is an interactive game show hosted by [[Arnell Ignacio]], with Maricar de Mesa as the first ''GobiGirl''. In 1998, GMA pioneered on [[Filipino language]] late night news broadcast with the news program ''[[GMA Network News]]'' as the first Filipino-language late-night television newscast after it was debuted six years ago as an [[English-language]] late-night newscast, as English newscasts were started since the introduction of television in the country in 1953. As the newscast fasten to higher than its English newscasts, all networks start to follow including [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]] in 1998, [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]] in 1999, [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]] in 2000, NBN (now [[People's Television Network|PTV]]) in 2001 and ABC (now [[5 (TV channel)|TV5]]) in 2004.\n\nGMA was the first Philippine broadcaster to receive a [[Peabody Award]] for Investigative Reporting in 1999.<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/investigative-reporting 59th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2000.</ref> Later, Citynet 27 became EMC, the first locally programmed music video channel, later becoming a part of the [[Channel V]] franchise called [[Channel V Philippines]]. Channel V the Philippines, however, ceased operations due to a conflict of interest between the owners of GMA and [[PLDT]] (which bought a stake in GMA), who operate [[MTV Philippines]] through their subsidiary, the [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation]]. GMA was also the Philippine broadcaster for ''[[2000 Today]]'', the most-successful international television special that commemorated the dawn of the new [[millennium]]. At the turn of the millennium, GMA was the only local network to go on 24-hour, non-stop broadcasting (However, in 2001, the network reduced back to regular broadcast hours for its regular transmitter maintenance due to NTC's rules and regulations for affiliated free-to-air TV stations). At the beginning of the year, Menardo Jimenez announced his retirement as president and CEO (he would later be assumed office as a member of the board of directors of [[San Miguel Corporation]] in 2002) and on December 31, 2000, Felipe Gozon assumed the position with his concurrent capacity as chairman. Duavit's son Gilberto Duavit Jr. assumed the post of the chief operating officer.\n\n===2000s===\nOn October 27, 2002, during an episode of the network's noontime show ''[[SOP (TV program)|SOP]]'', GMA officially revealed a new logo and image campaign. The new logo features a rainbow-colored heart-shaped logo, the Kapuso, represented by a new slogan \"Kapuso ng Pamilyang Pilipino, Anumang Kulay ng Buhay\" (\"One in Heart With the [[Filipinos|Filipino]] family, In Whatever Colors of Life\"), and a [[Century Gothic]] Bold font for the letters. The \"Kapuso\" theme song is sung by [[Regine Velasquez]].\n[[File:Gmajfaa.JPG|thumb|left|200px|View of GMA Network Center from [[Kamuning MRT Station]]]]\nIn 2003, ''Saksi'' won the New York Television Festival Gold Medal for best newscast, the first Philippine newscast to do so. This and the Peabody Award in 1999 earned the network a [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] commendation later that year.

GMA was an official TV network of the 4th World Meeting of Families held in Manila, Philippines.\n\nIn 2004, GMA launched line up of new programs and primetime shows such as ''[[Te Amo, Maging Sino Ka Man]]'', ''[[Hanggang Kailan (TV series)|Hanggang Kailan]]'', ''[[Forever in My Heart]]'', ''[[Marinara (TV series)|Marinara]]'', as well as, ''[[Bahay Mo Ba 'To?]]'', ''Naks!'', ''[[Lovely Day (TV program)|Lovely Day]]'', ''[[StarStruck Kids]]'', ''[[Ikaw sa Puso Ko]]'', ''[[Leya, ang Pinakamagandang Babae sa Ilalim ng Lupa]]'', ''30 Days'', ''[[Wag Kukurap]]'', ''[[Pinoy Pop Superstar]]'', ''[[SOP Gigsters]]'', ''[[Joyride (TV series)|Joyride]]'', ''3R'', ''Out'', ''[[Bitoy's Funniest Videos]]'' and the network's new early evening newscast [[24 Oras]].\n\nIn 2005, the company's subsidiary, Citynet Network Marketing and Productions, Inc., signed a co-production and block time agreement with [[ZOE Broadcasting Network]], allowing the GMA Network with another platform to showcase its programming and talents. On November 11, 2005, ZOE's flagship station, [[DZOE-TV|DZOE-TV Channel 11]], went on the air as ''Quality TeleVision'' (later known as Q and was reformatted to become GMA News TV), and broadcast shows that primarily targeted women audiences.

(20.01%), M.A. Jimenez Enterprises (13.49%), and Television International Corp. (9.94%).\n\nShareholder GMA Holdings, Inc. is jointly owned by Felipe L. Gozon, Gilberto Duavit, Jr., and Joel Marcelo Jimenez.\n\n==Branding==\n\n===Network identity===\nOn October 29, 1961, Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. launches its first television station in the Philippines, known back then as [[DZBB-TV|RBS TV Channel 7]]. GMA Network began branding its identity by eliminating call signs to its network identification.\n\n:*'''RBS TV Channel 7 (1961\u20131974)''' \u2013 From the success of its amplitude modulation band radio [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]], [[Robert Stewart (entrepreneur)|Robert La Rue \"Uncle Bob\" Stewart]] launches its first television and the Philippines third terrestrial channel, RBS TV Channel 7.\n:* '''GMA Radio-Television Arts (1974\u20131992)''' \u2013 To ascertain its presence in its coverage area, the Greater Manila Area, RBS changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts after the takeover by the new management.\n:* '''GMA Rainbow Satellite Network (Rainbow Network, 1992\u20131995)''' \u2013 When the network launched its satellite to widen its coverage area, GMA again rebranded its network identity on April 26, 1992.\n:* '''GMA Network (Rainbow Network, 1995\u20132002)''' \u2013 In preparation for the 45th year of responsible broadcasting, GMA Rainbow Satellite changed to GMA Network.\n:* '''GMA Network (Kapuso Network, 2002\u2013present)''' \u2013 On October 27, 2002, GMA Network unveiled its new identity and catchphrase. In an effort to localize and transform its image into a more intrinsic Filipino network, GMA Network engaged in a rebranding course.\n\n===Logos===\nGMA Network has used a number of logos throughout its history especially when Gozon, Jimenez, and Duavit acquired the station in 1975. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, the network used the [[Circle 7 logo]] for its Metro Manila and Cebu stations, which is also expended by several networks around the world (predominately the O&O stations of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States). In the 1980s, to refine its presence in the Philippine broadcast industry, GMA Network used the slogan ''Where You Belong'', and lasted for two decades before invigorating to another catchphrase. In 1992, GMA Network redefines itself as the '''Rainbow Network,''' succeeding the ensigns of the rainbow. Throughout the 1990s, the network developed the logo before having it replaced by its current logo in 2002 and as the '''Kapuso Network'''.<ref name=\"gmanetwork.com\"/> After a huge marketing campaign, and improved television ratings, the new insignia (the rainbow-colored stylized heart-shape logo known as '''''Kapuso''''') is now one of the most recognizable in the Philippines.\n\n===Slogans===\n'''''Kapuso ng Bawat Pilipino''''' ('''''One in Heart with Every Filipino''''')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/corporate/about|title=GMANetwork.com - Corporate - Official Corporate Website of the Kapuso Network|author=GMA New Media, Inc.|work=gmanetwork.com|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}</ref> is the secondary characteristic catchphrase of GMA Network.

Reality show ''[[Extra Challenge]]'' started to lead the ratings and with launch of \"telefantasya\" ''[[Mulawin]]''.

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's chief philosophical work is ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''Of Habit''); followed by \"''Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton''\" (in the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', November, 1840); ''Rapport sur le stoicisme'' (1851); ''La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); ''Morale et m\u00e9taphysique'' (1893). Eminent as a philosopher, Ravaisson also ontributed articles on ancient sculpture to the ''Revue Arch\u00e9ologique'' and the ''M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions'', in 1871 publishing a monograph on the [[Venus de Milo]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's chief philosophical work is ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''Of Habit''); followed by \"''Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton''\" (in the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', November, 1840); ''Rapport sur le stoicisme'' (1851); ''La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); ''Morale et m\u00e9taphysique'' (1893). Eminent as a philosopher, Ravaisson also ontributed articles on ancient sculpture to the ''Revue Arch\u00e9ologique'' and the ''M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions'', in 1871 publishing a monograph on the [[Venus de Milo]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

'''Fortune Mguni''' on 31 January 1975 in [[Wankie]], [[Rhodesia]]) is a [[Zimbabwean]] pro-democracy human rights [[lawyer]] well known for his fight for [[democracy]]. He currently resides in [[ HwangeinZimbabwe]].\n\n==Life background==\n\nMolokele was born Friday 31 January 1975 at the Wankie Colliery Hospital in the town of Hwange, in the north-western part of Zimbabwe.\n\nHis father's name was Godfrey Majahana Mguni. He was a career trade unionist and a well-known community leader in Hwange. Among his accomplishments was being elected as the Workers Committee Chairperson between 1979 and 1994. He was also a key leader of both the Associated Mineworkers Union of Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions. He died on 28 September 2003.\n\nMolokele's mother, Jane Mpofu, was a career educator specializing in pre-school education. She has since retired and is now based at Bulawayo.\n\n==Soccer and politics history in Molokele\u2019s family==\n\nHis father used to play in the amateur football league known as the Wankie Football Association. (WAFA) He was also the Chairperson for a team that played under the WAFA league known as the Zulu Royals Football Club. Perhaps not to be outdone by his dad, Molokele's younger brother also set up his own successful junior soccer team known as Skyline Football Club. The team used to play under the Lwendulu Football Association (LIFA) during the latter part of the 1980s.\n\nPolitically, both of Molokele's parents were active local leaders for the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) during his entire childhood years.\n\nMolokele spent all his childhood years at No.1 Colliery (Lwendulu Village). His family stayed at several homes in Hwange that included P63, O21, L24 and M28.\nMolokele did all his seven years of primary education at the St Ignatius primary school between 1982 and 1988.\n\nIn 1989, he was enrolled at a boarding school (Ingwenya Mission) at Ntabazinduna, just outside Bulawayo where he did his studies from Form 1 to 4 at John Tallach secondary school till 1992. Between 1993 and 1994, he was enrolled at another boarding school in Gweru where he did his A level studies at [[Fletcher High School, Gweru|Fletcher High School]].\n\nIn March 1995, he was admitted at the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) law faculty where he completed his Bachelor of Laws honours degree in May 1999.\n\nMolokele was an activist from the time he arrived at the UZ. He was actively involved in various campus platforms such as the Christian Union, Matabeleland Development Society and of course in the mainstream student politics. In this regard, Molokele became one of the most successful student political leaders in the history of Zimbabwe. He was a student leader at the University of Zimbabwe in Harare between 1995 and 1999.\n\nDuring the said period, he contested in three different elections in which he was elected as the Secretary General, Vice President and then finally as the President of the Students Union.\n\nHe was also involved in the national and international student politics. Specifically, he was elected as the Vice President of the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) from 1997 to 1999. He also participated in different programmes and conferences of the Southern African Students Union (SASU) from 1997 to 1999.\n\nHe was one of the prominent student leaders that were instrumental in the setting up of the constitutional movement of Zimbabwe in 1997, the National Constitutional Assembly. (NCA) He was also at the forefront in the role that was played by the students\u2019 movement in the setting up of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in 1999.\n\nUnlike his peers, the late [[Learnmore Jongwe]], [[Job Sikhala]] and Tafadzwa Musekiwa, among others, he opted not to be a Member of Parliament in 2000 and chose to work with the broader civil society movement initially in Zimbabwe before focusing at South Africa and Africa at large.\n\nAfter his university years, Molokele relocated to Bulawayo where he initially worked as a legal practitioner at Ben Baron and Partners. He was soon lured to full-time activism when he was appointed as the Bulawayo regional programme officer for the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA). Afterwards he also worked as the Zimbabwe southern regional programme officer for the local chapter of Transparency International (TIZ).\n\nDuring his Bulawayo years from June 1999 to December 2003, Molokele was actively involved in the setting up of various organisations such as the Christian Legal Society (CLS), Gospel Music Association (GMA) and the Christian Leadership Forum (CLF), Bulawayo Agenda, among others.\n\nMolokele relocated from Bulawayo to Johannesburg in January 2004. Prior to that, Molokele had changed his legal name from Fortune Mguni to Fortune Daniel Molokela-Tsiye in 2000, after a personal quest to reclaim his original family identity. His father's family only started using the Mguni surname after the death of his grandfather in the early 1970s. The process culminated in him being re-united with his father's original people, the Molokele clan in Mafikeng, South Africa, in September 2004.\n\nDuring his early years in South Africa, Molokele continued his activism and was actively involved with various organisations and platforms. These included the Peace and Democracy Project (PDP), Zimbabwe Diaspora CSOs Forum, Zimbabwe Diaspora Development Chamber (ZDDC) and the Global Zimbabwe Forum. (GZF) In fact, it was due to his active role at the GZF that he was seconded to set up its office at Geneva in Switzerland between May and December 2008.\n\nMolokele has also been employed by various other organisations in South Africa over the years. These include among others, Zimonline Media Trust, Doctors without Borders (MSF), Southern Africa Editors Forum (SAEF), and the World AIDS Campaign International (WACI).\n\nHe was based at Cape Town between May 2009 and April 2011 where he was instrumental in the mobilisation of the Zimbabwean community there under the local chapter of the GZF.\n\nIn recent years, Molokele has been actively involved with such platforms as the Zimbabwe Diaspora Support Initiative (ZDESI), Learnmore and Rutendo Jongwe Memorial trust, Friends of Nora Tapiwa, Highlanders FC Bosso South Africa branch and also the Southern Africa regional offices for the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition.\n\nMolokele has also been actively involved with the local South Africa civil society. In particular, he has sat in the national boards for such organisations as Transparency International South Africa, Amnesty International South Africa and MISA-South Africa. He has also been an active member of the South African Institute of International Affairs, Freedom of Expression Institute of South Africa and the Gender Media Network of Southern Africa.\n\n==Career in writing==\n\nMolokele has always regarded himself as a creative writer. He has over the years written several unpublished works and manuscripts ranging from biographies, fictional stories, poetry and movie scripts. Added to that, he has also written regularly in various media forums in South Africa such as the Mail & Guardian and Zimonline.\n\nIn particular, he has written personal column articles in such publications as Moto magazine, NewZimbabwe.com and The Zimbabwean.\n\nMolokele is an active Christian. In this regard he has been also actively involved in the setting up of both the Johannesburg and Cape Town branches of the Victory Fellowship Church that is originally from Bulawayo. He now attends the His People Church at Johannesburg.\n\nMolokele has also managed to further his studies and recently graduated with a Masters in Human Rights Litigation degree from the University of South Africa.\n\nHe was until the end of May 2014 based at Rosebank at Johannesburg where he was working as the Civil Society Partnerships Programme Manager for the Southern Africa Regional Programme on Access to Medicines and Diagnostics (SARPAM) <ref>http://www.sarpam.net</ref>\n\nFrom July 2014 to Nov 2016 he worked at AIDS Accountability International (AAI).<ref>http://www.aidsaccountability.org</ref>\n\n==Family==\n\nHe has also been married to a supportive partner, Doctor Samukeliso Dube since November 2001 and they have a daughter called Matilda-Jane, who was born on 1 April 2006.\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070804042202/http://www.sokwanele.com/articles/homepage/happybirthday_21feb2005.html Happy Birthday Mr Mugabe!]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070621183213/http://newzimbabwe.com/pages/fortune91.16476.html The Zimbabwe I Don't Want]\n*[http://storiesonmalawi.blogspot.com/2007_04_20_archive.html Zimbabwe and Malawi: the eternal bond that binds us]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025157/http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/fortune57.13693.html Open Letter to Didymus Mutasa]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Molokele, Daniel Fortune}}\n[[Category:1975 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Zimbabwean democracy activists]]\n[[Category:Zimbabwean expatriates in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Zimbabwean lawyers]]\n[[Category:Zimbabwean exiles]]\n[[Category:People from Bulawayo]]\n[[Category:University of Zimbabwe alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=December 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name              = Daniel Molokele\n| image             = \n| image_size        = 140px\n| birth_name        = Fortune Mguni\n| birth_date        = {{birth date and age|1975|1|31|df=y}}\n| birth_place       = [[Bulawayo]], [[Rhodesia]]\n| nationality       = Zimbabwean\n| alma_mater  = [[University of Zimbabwe]]\n}}\n'''Daniel Fortune Molokele''' (b. '''Fortune Mguni''' on 31 January 1975 in [[Wankie]], [[Rhodesia]]) is a [[Zimbabwean]] pro-democracy human rights [[lawyer]] well known for his fight for [[democracy]]. He currently resides in [[South Africa]].\n\n==Life background==\n\nMolokele was born Friday 31 January 1975 at the Wankie Colliery Hospital in the town of Hwange, in the north-western part of Zimbabwe.\n\nHis father's name was Godfrey Majahana Mguni. He was a career trade unionist and a well-known community leader in Hwange. Among his accomplishments was being elected as the Workers Committee Chairperson between 1979 and 1994. He was also a key leader of both the Associated Mineworkers Union of Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions. He died on 28 September 2003.\n\nMolokele's mother, Jane Mpofu, was a career educator specializing in pre-school education. She has since retired and is now based at Bulawayo.\n\n==Soccer and politics history in Molokele\u2019s family==\n\nHis father used to play in the amateur football league known as the Wankie Football Association. (WAFA) He was also the Chairperson for a team that played under the WAFA league known as the Zulu Royals Football Club. Perhaps not to be outdone by his dad, Molokele's younger brother also set up his own successful junior soccer team known as Skyline Football Club. The team used to play under the Lwendulu Football Association (LIFA) during the latter part of the 1980s.\n\nPolitically, both of Molokele's parents were active local leaders for the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) during his entire childhood years.\n\nMolokele spent all his childhood years at No.1 Colliery (Lwendulu Village). His family stayed at several homes in Hwange that included P63, O21, L24 and M28.\nMolokele did all his seven years of primary education at the St Ignatius primary school between 1982 and 1988.\n\nIn 1989, he was enrolled at a boarding school (Ingwenya Mission) at Ntabazinduna, just outside Bulawayo where he did his studies from Form 1 to 4 at John Tallach secondary school till 1992. Between 1993 and 1994, he was enrolled at another boarding school in Gweru where he did his A level studies at [[Fletcher High School, Gweru|Fletcher High School]].\n\nIn March 1995, he was admitted at the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) law faculty where he completed his Bachelor of Laws honours degree in May 1999.\n\nMolokele was an activist from the time he arrived at the UZ. He was actively involved in various campus platforms such as the Christian Union, Matabeleland Development Society and of course in the mainstream student politics. In this regard, Molokele became one of the most successful student political leaders in the history of Zimbabwe. He was a student leader at the University of Zimbabwe in Harare between 1995 and 1999.\n\nDuring the said period, he contested in three different elections in which he was elected as the Secretary General, Vice President and then finally as the President of the Students Union.\n\nHe was also involved in the national and international student politics.
