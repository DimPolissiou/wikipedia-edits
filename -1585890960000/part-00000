It cost approximately $22 million to build.\n\n===National championships===\n* 1991: NCAA by defeating [[University of Southern California|USC]]\n\nWith an overall record of 31 wins and just 4 losses, the 1991 NCAA Men's Volleyball Champions swept three out of their five post-season opponents.  In the WIVA Tournament (Irvine, CA) the 49ers beat [[UCSB]] and [[San Diego State University|SDSU]] 3\u20130 before overcoming county/national nemesis, the [[UCLA]] Bruins 3\u20132.  From there it was on to Hawaii for the '91 Final Four.  'the Beach' said [[aloha]] to Penn State in a clean sweep 3\u20130; they then needed an extra game winning 3\u20131 over longtime rival [[University of Southern California|USC]] for their first national championship to date.\n\n1991's team included these mentionable leaders: Alan Knipe, Brent Hilliard (NCAA Final Four MVP), Brett Winslow, Jason Stimpfig and Ray Ratelle (Asics/VB Mag. & AVCA C.O.Y.).  No other 'BEACH' Men's VB Team has ever won as many games as this singular team; they were a combined 89% in their win-lost ratio.\n\n* 2018: Won second NCAA title by defeating UCLA 3-2 (at Westwood, [[Los Angeles]]). They defeated Ohio State University (defending national champions) 3-1 in the semi-finals. \n\nWith co-Valuables Josh Tunaniga, JR-Setter AND TJ DeFalco, JR-Outside Hitter, eight thousand in the stands were treated to a thrilling five-setter match (in overtime) favoring the men of south L.A. county.\n* 2019: Won third NCAA title by defeating Hawaii 3-1 (at Long Beach). LB defeated Pepperdine University 3-1 in the semi-finals.\n\n==Notable players==\n* '''[[Taylor Crabb]]''' \u2013 2013 AVCA P.O.Y.; AVCA 2013 & 2014 1st Team All-American, 2012 Volleyball Magazine 3rd Team All-American \n* '''[[Bob Ctvrtlik]]''' \u2013 Asics/VB Mag. honorable mention All-American (1983), First U.S. Olympic Team Member/49er who won Olympic Medals in men's volleyball (1988, gold; 1992, bronze)\n* '''[[Torey Defalco]]''' \u2013 a.k.a.

His [[second lieutenant]] bars were pinned on by General [[James Van Fleet]] personally. He then assumed command of B Company and led them back up Pork Chop Hill.\n\nThe commission made him eligible to become a pilot, a childhood dream of his.  However, when he applied for pilot training he was told that, at six feet four inches, he was \"too tall\" for pilot duty.

Later, after arriving back at base, they learned that the soldiers had come under intense fire and had taken heavy casualties. Enemy fire around the landing zones was so heavy that the landing zone was closed to [[medical evacuation]] helicopters. Freeman and his commander, Major [[Bruce Crandall]], volunteered to fly their unarmed, lightly armored [[UH-1 Huey]] in support of the embattled troops. Freeman made a total of fourteen trips to the battlefield, bringing in water and ammunition and taking out wounded soldiers under heavy enemy fire in what was later named the [[Battle of Ia Drang]].\n\nFreeman was subsequently promoted to the rank of [[major]], designated as a Master Army Aviator, and was sent home from Vietnam in 1966.\n\n===Medal of Honor===\n[[File:Ed freeman 2001.jpg|thumb|280px|Ed Freeman (left) is congratulated by President George W.

He was formally presented with the medal on July 16, 2001, in the [[East Room]] of the White House by President [[George W. Bush]].<ref name=\"TDN\"/>\n\nFreeman's official Medal of Honor citation reads:\n\n<blockquote>\nCaptain Ed W. Freeman, United States Army, distinguished himself by numerous acts of conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary intrepidity on 14 November 1965 while serving with Company A, 229th Assault Helicopter Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). As a flight leader and second in command of a 16-helicopter lift unit, he supported a heavily engaged American infantry battalion at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley, Republic of Vietnam. The unit was almost out of ammunition after taking some of the heaviest casualties of the war, fighting off a relentless attack from a highly motivated, heavily armed enemy force. When the infantry commander closed the helicopter landing zone due to intense direct enemy fire, Captain Freeman risked his own life by flying his unarmed helicopter through a gauntlet of enemy fire time after time, delivering critically needed ammunition, water and medical supplies to the besieged battalion. His flights had a direct impact on the battle's outcome by providing the engaged units with timely supplies of ammunition critical to their survival, without which they would almost surely have gone down, with much greater loss of life. After medical evacuation helicopters refused to fly into the area due to intense enemy fire, Captain Freeman flew 14 separate rescue missions, providing life-saving evacuation of an estimated 30 seriously wounded soldiers -- some of whom would not have survived had he not acted. All flights were made into a small emergency landing zone within 100 to 200 meters of the defensive perimeter where heavily committed units were perilously holding off the attacking elements. Captain Freeman's selfless acts of great valor, extraordinary perseverance and intrepidity were far above and beyond the call of duty or mission and set a superb example of leadership and courage for all of his peers.

He participated in the [[Battle of Pork Chop Hill]] and earned a [[battlefield commission]] as one of only 14 survivors out of 257 men who made it through the opening stages of the battle. His [[second lieutenant]] bars were pinned on by General [[James Van Fleet]] personally. He then assumed command of B Company and led them back up Pork Chop Hill.\n\nThe commission made him eligible to become a pilot, a childhood dream of his.  However, when he applied for pilot training he was told that, at six feet four inches, he was \"too tall\" for pilot duty.

Later, after arriving back at base, they learned that the soldiers had come under intense fire and had taken heavy casualties. Enemy fire around the landing zones was so heavy that the landing zone was closed to [[medical evacuation]] helicopters. Freeman and his commander, Major [[Bruce Crandall]], volunteered to fly their unarmed, lightly armored [[UH-1 Huey]] in support of the embattled troops. Freeman made a total of fourteen trips to the battlefield, bringing in water and ammunition and taking out wounded soldiers under heavy enemy fire in what was later named the [[Battle of Ia Drang]].\n\nFreeman was subsequently promoted to the rank of [[major]], designated as a Master Army Aviator, and was sent home from Vietnam in 1966.\n\n===Medal of Honor===\n[[File:Ed freeman 2001.jpg|thumb|280px|Ed Freeman (left) is congratulated by President George W. Bush after receiving his award.]]\nFreeman's commanding officer nominated him for the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions at Ia Drang, but not in time to meet a two-year deadline then in place.<ref name=\"TDN\"/> He was instead awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].<ref name=\"Bonner\"/> The Medal of Honor nomination was disregarded until 1995, when the two-year deadline was removed. He was formally presented with the medal on July 16, 2001, in the [[East Room]] of the White House by President [[George W. Bush]].<ref name=\"TDN\"/>\n\nFreeman's official Medal of Honor citation reads:\n\n<blockquote>\nCaptain Ed W. Freeman, United States Army, distinguished himself by numerous acts of conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary intrepidity on 14 November 1965 while serving with Company A, 229th Assault Helicopter Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). As a flight leader and second in command of a 16-helicopter lift unit, he supported a heavily engaged American infantry battalion at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley, Republic of Vietnam. The unit was almost out of ammunition after taking some of the heaviest casualties of the war, fighting off a relentless attack from a highly motivated, heavily armed enemy force. When the infantry commander closed the helicopter landing zone due to intense direct enemy fire, Captain Freeman risked his own life by flying his unarmed helicopter through a gauntlet of enemy fire time after time, delivering critically needed ammunition, water and medical supplies to the besieged battalion. His flights had a direct impact on the battle's outcome by providing the engaged units with timely supplies of ammunition critical to their survival, without which they would almost surely have gone down, with much greater loss of life. After medical evacuation helicopters refused to fly into the area due to intense enemy fire, Captain Freeman flew 14 separate rescue missions, providing life-saving evacuation of an estimated 30 seriously wounded soldiers -- some of whom would not have survived had he not acted. All flights were made into a small emergency landing zone within 100 to 200 meters of the defensive perimeter where heavily committed units were perilously holding off the attacking elements. Captain Freeman's selfless acts of great valor, extraordinary perseverance and intrepidity were far above and beyond the call of duty or mission and set a superb example of leadership and courage for all of his peers. Captain Freeman's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.<ref name=\"citation\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:EdFreemanMoH.jpg|thumb|300px|After receiving the Medal of Honor, Ed Freeman was inducted into [[the Pentagon]]'s Hall of Heroes on July 17, 2001.

The family moved to [[Vienna]] in 1877. His mother died in 1891.\n\nKraus enrolled as a law student at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1892. Beginning in April of the same year, he began contributing to the paper {{Lang|de|Wiener Literaturzeitung}}, starting with a critique of [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]'s ''[[The Weavers (play)|The Weavers]]''. Around that time, he unsuccessfully tried to perform as an actor in a small theater. In 1894, he changed his field of studies to philosophy and German literature. He discontinued his studies in 1896. His friendship with [[Peter Altenberg]] began about this time.\n\n===Career===\n\n====Before 1900====\n[[File:Fackel Kraus 1899 (1) Cover.jpg|thumb|First issue of ''Die Fackel'']]\nIn 1896, Kraus left university without a diploma to begin work as an actor, stage director and performer, joining the [[Young Vienna]] group, which included [[Peter Altenberg]], [[Leopold Andrian]], [[Hermann Bahr]], [[Richard Beer-Hofmann]], [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], and [[Felix Salten]]. In 1897, Kraus broke from this group with a biting satire, {{Lang|de|Die demolierte Literatur}} (''Demolished Literature''), and was named Vienna correspondent for the newspaper ''Breslauer Zeitung''. One year later, as an uncompromising advocate of Jewish assimilation, he attacked the founder of modern Zionism, [[Theodor Herzl]], with his polemic {{Lang|de|Eine Krone f\u00fcr Zion}} (''A Crown for Zion''). The title is a play on words, in that ''Krone'' means both \"crown\" and the currency of Austria-Hungary from 1892 to 1918; one ''Krone'' was the minimum donation required to participate in the [[Zionist Congress]] in [[Basel]], and Herzl was often mocked as the \"king of Zion\" (''K\u00f6nig von Zion'') by Viennese anti-Zionists.\n\nOn April 1, 1899, Kraus renounced [[Judaism]], and in the same year he founded his own newspaper, ''{{ill|Die Fackel|de}}'' (''The Torch''), which he continued to direct, publish, and write until his death, and from which he launched his attacks on [[hypocrisy]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[political corruption|corruption]] of the [[Habsburg|Habsburg empire]], [[nationalism]] of the [[pan-German]] movement, [[laissez-faire]] economic policies, and numerous other subjects.\n\n====1900\u20131909====\nIn 1901 Kraus was sued by [[Hermann Bahr]] and Emmerich Bukovics, who felt they had been attacked in ''Die Fackel''. Many lawsuits by various offended parties followed in later years. Also in 1901, Kraus found out that his publisher, Moriz Frisch, had taken over his magazine while he was absent on a months-long journey. Frisch had registered the magazine's front cover as a trademark and published the ''Neue Fackel'' (''New Torch''). Kraus sued and won. From that time, ''Die Fackel'' was published (without a cover page) by the printer Jahoda & Siegel.\n\nWhile ''Die Fackel'' at first resembled journals like ''[[Die Weltb\u00fchne]]'', it increasingly became a magazine that was privileged in its [[editorial independence]], thanks to Kraus's financial independence. ''Die Fackel'' printed what Kraus wanted to be printed. In its first decade, contributors included such well-known writers and artists as [[Peter Altenberg]], [[Richard Dehmel]], [[Egon Friedell]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler]], [[Adolf Loos]], [[Heinrich Mann]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Georg Trakl]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and [[Oscar Wilde]]. After 1911, however, Kraus was usually the sole author. Kraus's work was published nearly exclusively in ''Die Fackel'', of which 922 irregularly issued numbers appeared in total. Authors who were supported by Kraus include Peter Altenberg, Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, and Georg Trakl.\n\n''Die Fackel'' targeted corruption, journalists and brutish behaviour. Notable enemies were [[Maximilian Harden]] (in the mud of the [[Harden\u2013Eulenburg affair]]), [[Moriz Benedikt]] (owner of the newspaper ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''), [[Alfred Kerr]], [[Hermann Bahr]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Imre Bekessy|de}} and [[Johann Schober]].\n\nIn 1902, Kraus published ''Sittlichkeit und Kriminalit\u00e4t'' (''Morality and Criminal Justice''), for the first time commenting on what was to become one of his main preoccupations: he attacked the general opinion of the time that it was necessary to defend sexual morality by means of criminal justice (''Der Skandal f\u00e4ngt an, wenn die Polizei ihm ein Ende macht'', ''The Scandal Starts When the Police Ends It'').<ref>quoted following ''Spr\u00fcche und Widerspr\u00fcche'' (''Sayings and Gainsayings''), Suhrkamp, Frankfurt/M. 1984, p. 42</ref> Starting in 1906, Kraus published the first of his [[aphorism]]s in ''Die Fackel''; they were collected in 1909 in the book ''Spr\u00fcche und Widerspr\u00fcche'' (''Sayings and Gainsayings'').\n\nIn addition to his writings, Kraus gave numerous highly influential public readings during his career, put on approximately 700 one-man performances between 1892 and 1936 in which he read from the dramas of [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Johann Nestroy]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and also performed [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s operettas, accompanied by piano and singing all the roles himself. [[Elias Canetti]], who regularly attended Kraus's lectures, titled the second volume of his autobiography ''\"Die Fackel\" im Ohr'' (''\"The Torch\" in the Ear'') in reference to the magazine and its author. At the peak of his popularity, Kraus's lectures attracted four thousand people, and his magazine sold forty thousand copies.<ref name=\"MATTL09\" />\n\nIn 1904, Kraus supported [[Frank Wedekind]] to make possible the staging in Vienna of his controversial play ''[[Pandora's Box (play)|Pandora's Box]]'';<ref name=\"Bru06\" /> the play told the story of a sexually enticing young dancer who rises in German society through her relationships with wealthy men but later falls into poverty and prostitution.<ref name=\"mueller\">Carl R. Mueller, Introduction to ''Frank Wedekind: Four Major Plays'', Vol 1, Lyme, NH: Smith and Krauss, 2000</ref> These plays' frank depiction of sexuality and violence, including [[lesbianism]] and an encounter with [[Jack the Ripper]],{{sfnp|Willett|1959|p=73n}} pushed against the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time. Wedekind's works are considered among the precursors of expressionism, but in 1914, when expressionist poets like [[Richard Dehmel]] began producing war propaganda, Kraus became a fierce critic of them.<ref name=\"MATTL09\">Siegfried Mattl (2009) [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&fid=4612264&jid=MIH&volumeId=6&issueId=01&aid=4612256 \"The Ambivalence of Modernism From the Weimar Republic to National Socialism and Red Vienna\"], ''Modern Intellectual History'', Volume 6, Issue 01, April 2009, pp. 223\u2013234</ref><ref name=\"Bru06\">Sascha Bru, Gunther Martens (2006) ''The invention of politics in the European avant-garde (1906\u20131940)'' pp. 52\u20135</ref>\n\nIn 1907, Kraus attacked his erstwhile benefactor Maximilian Harden because of his role in the Eulenburg trial in the first of his spectacular ''Erledigungen'' (''Dispatches'').{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n====1910\u20131919====\nAfter 1911, Kraus was the sole author of most issues of ''Die Fackel''.\n\nOne of Kraus's most influential satirical-literary techniques was his clever [[wordplay]] with quotations. One controversy arose with the text ''Die Orgie'', which exposed how the newspaper ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]'' was blatantly supporting [[Liberalism in Austria#Liberal Political Parties in Austria|Austria's Liberal Party]]'s election campaign; the text was conceived as a guerrilla prank and sent as a fake letter to the newspaper (''Die Fackel'' would publish it later in 1911); the enraged editor, who fell for the trick, responded by suing Kraus for \"disturbing the serious business of politicians and editors\".<ref name=\"Bru06\" />\n\nAfter an obituary for [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], who had been [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassinated in Sarajevo]] on 28 June 1914, ''Die Fackel'' was not published for many months. In December 1914, it appeared again with an essay \"In dieser gro\u00dfen Zeit\" (\"In this grand time\"): \"In dieser gro\u00dfen Zeit, die ich noch gekannt habe, wie sie so klein war; die wieder klein werden wird, wenn ihr dazu noch Zeit bleibt; \u2026 in dieser lauten Zeit, die da dr\u00f6hnt von der schauerlichen Symphonie der Taten, die Berichte hervorbringen, und der Berichte, welche Taten verschulden: in dieser da m\u00f6gen Sie von mir kein eigenes Wort erwarten.\"<ref>''Die Fackel'', No. 404, December 1914, p. 1</ref> (\"In this grand time, which I used to know when it was this small; which will become small again if there is time; \u2026 in this loud time that resounds from the ghastly symphony of deeds that spawn reports, and of reports that cause deeds: in this one, you may not expect a word of my own.\") In the subsequent time, Kraus wrote against the World War, and censors repeatedly confiscated or obstructed editions of ''Die Fackel''.\n\nKraus's masterpiece is generally considered to be the massive satirical play about the [[First World War]], ''Die letzten Tage der Menschheit'' (''[[The Last Days of Mankind]]''), which combines dialogue from contemporary documents with [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[fantasy]] and commentary by two characters called \"the Grumbler\" and \"the Optimist\". Kraus began to write the play in 1915 and first published it as a series of special ''Fackel'' issues in 1919. Its epilogue, \"Die letzte Nacht\" (\"The last night\") had already been published in 1918 as a special issue.\n[[Edward Timms]] has called the work a \"faulted masterpiece\" and a \"fissured text\" because the evolution of Kraus's attitude during the time of its composition (from [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] [[Conservatism|conservative]] to [[democracy|democratic]] [[republicanism|republican]]) gave the text structural inconsistencies resembling a [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]].<ref>[[Edward Timms]], ''Karl Kraus, Apocalyptic Satirist: Culture and Catastrophe in Habsburg Vienna'' (1986), 374, 380.</ref>\n\nAlso in 1919, Kraus published his collected war texts under the title ''Weltgericht'' (''World Court of Justice''). In 1920, he published the satire ''Literatur oder man wird doch da sehn'' (''Literature, or You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet'') as a reply to [[Franz Werfel]]'s ''Spiegelmensch'' (''Mirror Man''), an attack against Kraus.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:KarlKraus.jpg|thumb|Plaque of Karl Kraus on the house where he was born in [[Ji\u010d\u00edn]]]]\n\n====1920\u20131936====\nDuring January 1924, Kraus started a fight against Imre B\u00e9kessy, publisher of the tabloid ''Die Stunde'' (''The Hour''), accusing him of extorting money from restaurant owners by threatening them with bad reviews unless they paid him. B\u00e9kessy retaliated with a libel campaign against Kraus, who in turn launched an ''Erledigung'' with the catchphrase \"Hinaus aus Wien mit dem Schuft!\" (\"Throw the scoundrel out of Vienna!\"). In 1926, B\u00e9kessy indeed fled Vienna to avoid arrest. B\u00e9kessy achieved some later success when his novel ''Barabbas'' was the monthly selection of an American book club.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nA peak in Kraus's political commitment was his sensational attack in 1927 on the powerful Vienna police chief [[Johann Schober]], also a former two-term chancellor, after 89 rioters were shot dead by the police during the 1927 [[July Revolt of 1927|July Revolt]]. Kraus produced a poster that in a single sentence requested Schober's resignation; the poster was published all over Vienna and is considered an icon of 20th-century Austrian history.<ref name=\"MATTL09\" />\n\nIn 1928, the play ''Die Un\u00fcberwindlichen'' (''The Insurmountables'') was published. It included allusions to the fights against B\u00e9kessy and Schober. During that same year, Kraus also published the records of a lawsuit Kerr had filed against him after Kraus had published Kerr's war poems in ''Die Fackel'' (Kerr, having become a pacifist, did not want his earlier enthusiasm for the war exposed). In 1932, Kraus translated [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] sonnets.\n\nKraus supported the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] from at least the early 1920s,<ref name=\"MATTL09\" /> and in 1934, hoping [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] could prevent Nazism from engulfing Austria, he supported Dollfuss's coup d'\u00e9tat, which established the Austrian fascist regime.<ref name=\"MATTL09\" /> This support estranged Kraus from some of his followers.\n\nIn 1933 Kraus wrote ''Die Dritte Walpurgisnacht'' (''The Third [[Walpurgis Night]]''), of which the first fragments appeared in ''Die Fackel''. Kraus withheld full publication in part to protect his friends and followers hostile to Hitler who still lived in the Third Reich from Nazi reprisals, and in part because \"violence is no subject for polemic.\"<ref>Kraus (1934) ''Die Fackel'' Nr. 890, \"{{Lang|de|Warum die Fackel nicht erscheint|italic=no}}\", p. 26, quotation: \"Gewalt kein Objekt der Polemik\"</ref><ref>Kovacsics, Adan (2011) ''Seleci\u00f3n de art\u00edculos de \u00abDie Fackel\u00bb'', p. 524, quotation: \"la obra que Kraus escribi\u00f3 en 1933, pero que no public\u00f3, en parte, como \u00e9l mismo se\u00f1ala, porque no puede ser \u00abla violencia objeto de pol\u00e9mica ni la locura objeto de s\u00e1tira\u00bb, en parte porque tem\u00eda comprometer a sus amigos y seguidores en Alemania y ponerlos en peligro.\"</ref><ref>Freschi, Marino (1996) Preface to the Italian translation of ''The Third Walpurgis Night'', pp. XXI\u2013XXII , quotation: \"Il progetto venne bloccato dalle remore avvertite da Kraus, preoccupato di coinvolgere amici e conoscenti citati nel libro e ostili a Hitler, che ancora vivevano nel Terzo Reich.\"</ref> This satire on Nazi ideology begins with the now-famous sentence, \"{{Lang|de|Mir f\u00e4llt zu Hitler nichts ein|italic=no}}\" (\"Hitler brings nothing to my mind\"). Lengthy extracts appear in Kraus's apologia for his silence at Hitler's coming to power, \"{{Lang|de|Warum die ''Fackel'' nicht erscheint|italic=unset}}\" (\"Why ''Die Fackel'' is not published\"), a 315-page edition of the periodical. The last issue of ''Die Fackel'' appeared in February 1936. Shortly after, he fell in a collision with a bicyclist and suffered intense headaches and loss of memory. He gave his last lecture in April, and had a severe heart attack in the [[Hotel Imperial|Caf\u00e9 Imperial]] on June 10. He died in his apartment in Vienna on June 12, 1936, and was buried in the [[Zentralfriedhof]] cemetery in Vienna.\n\nKraus never married, but from 1913 until his death he had a conflict-prone but close relationship with the Baroness [[Sidonie N\u00e1dhern\u00e1 von Borut\u00edn]] (1885\u20131950). Many of his works were written in Janowitz castle, N\u00e1dherny family property. Sidonie N\u00e1dhern\u00e1 became an important pen pal to Kraus and addressee of his books and poems.<ref>[http://www.clivejames.com/karl-kraus \"The Question of Karl Kraus\"] (from ''The Revolt of the Pendulum'', 2009), ''[[Australian Literary Review]]'', March 2007, via [[Clive James|clivejames.com]]</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Kraus was [[baptism|baptized]] as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], but in 1923, disillusioned by the Church's support for the war, [[Apostasy|he left]] the Catholic Church, claiming sarcastically that he was motivated \"primarily by antisemitism\", i.e. indignation at [[Max Reinhardt]]'s use of the [[Kollegienkirche, Salzburg|Kollegienkirche]] in Salzburg as the venue for a theatrical performance.<ref>[[Edward Timms]], ''Karl Kraus, Apocalyptic Satirist: The Post-War Crisis and the Rise of the Swastika'' (2005), pp. 282\u2013283.</ref>\n\nKraus was the subject of two books by [[Thomas Szasz]], ''Karl Kraus and the Soul Doctors'' and ''Anti-Freud: Karl Kraus's Criticism of Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry'', which portray Kraus as a harsh critic of [[Sigmund Freud]] and of [[psychoanalysis]] in general.<ref>Szasz, ''Karl Kraus and the Soul-Doctors'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1977, pp. 19\u201320</ref> Other commentators, such as [[Edward Timms]], have argued that Kraus respected Freud, though with reservations about the application of some of his theories, and that his views were far less black-and-white than Szasz suggests.<ref>[[Edward Timms|Timms, Edward]], ''Karl Kraus \u2013 Apocalyptic Satirist: Culture and Catastrophe in Habsburg Vienna'' (1986).

[[Marcel Reich-Ranicki]] called him 'vain, self-righteous and self-important'.<ref>Harry Zohn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zMTJ6QWnaNYC&pg=PA90 ''Karl Kraus and the Critics''], Camden House, 1997, p. 90</ref> Kraus's followers saw in him an infallible authority who would do anything to help those he supported.

Viennese composer [[Ernst Krenek]] described meeting the writer in 1932: \"At a time when people were generally decrying the [[History of Shanghai#End of Old Shanghai .281937.E2.80.931945.29|Japanese bombardment of Shanghai]], I met Karl Kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems. He said something like: 'I know that everything is futile when the house is burning.

The family moved to [[Vienna]] in 1877. His mother died in 1891.\n\nKraus enrolled as a law student at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1892. Beginning in April of the same year, he began contributing to the paper {{Lang|de|Wiener Literaturzeitung}}, starting with a critique of [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]'s ''[[The Weavers (play)|The Weavers]]''. Around that time, he unsuccessfully tried to perform as an actor in a small theater. In 1894, he changed his field of studies to philosophy and German literature. He discontinued his studies in 1896. His friendship with [[Peter Altenberg]] began about this time.\n\n===Career===\n\n====Before 1900====\n[[File:Fackel Kraus 1899 (1) Cover.jpg|thumb|First issue of ''Die Fackel'']]\nIn 1896, Kraus left university without a diploma to begin work as an actor, stage director and performer, joining the [[Young Vienna]] group, which included [[Peter Altenberg]], [[Leopold Andrian]], [[Hermann Bahr]], [[Richard Beer-Hofmann]], [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], and [[Felix Salten]]. In 1897, Kraus broke from this group with a biting satire, {{Lang|de|Die demolierte Literatur}} (''Demolished Literature''), and was named Vienna correspondent for the newspaper ''Breslauer Zeitung''. One year later, as an uncompromising advocate of Jewish assimilation, he attacked the founder of modern Zionism, [[Theodor Herzl]], with his polemic {{Lang|de|Eine Krone f\u00fcr Zion}} (''A Crown for Zion''). The title is a play on words, in that ''Krone'' means both \"crown\" and the currency of Austria-Hungary from 1892 to 1918; one ''Krone'' was the minimum donation required to participate in the [[Zionist Congress]] in [[Basel]], and Herzl was often mocked as the \"king of Zion\" (''K\u00f6nig von Zion'') by Viennese anti-Zionists.\n\nOn April 1, 1899, Kraus renounced [[Judaism]], and in the same year he founded his own newspaper, ''{{ill|Die Fackel|de}}'' (''The Torch''), which he continued to direct, publish, and write until his death, and from which he launched his attacks on [[hypocrisy]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[political corruption|corruption]] of the [[Habsburg|Habsburg empire]], [[nationalism]] of the [[pan-German]] movement, [[laissez-faire]] economic policies, and numerous other subjects.\n\n====1900\u20131909====\nIn 1901 Kraus was sued by [[Hermann Bahr]] and Emmerich Bukovics, who felt they had been attacked in ''Die Fackel''. Many lawsuits by various offended parties followed in later years. Also in 1901, Kraus found out that his publisher, Moriz Frisch, had taken over his magazine while he was absent on a months-long journey. Frisch had registered the magazine's front cover as a trademark and published the ''Neue Fackel'' (''New Torch''). Kraus sued and won. From that time, ''Die Fackel'' was published (without a cover page) by the printer Jahoda & Siegel.\n\nWhile ''Die Fackel'' at first resembled journals like ''[[Die Weltb\u00fchne]]'', it increasingly became a magazine that was privileged in its [[editorial independence]], thanks to Kraus's financial independence. ''Die Fackel'' printed what Kraus wanted to be printed. In its first decade, contributors included such well-known writers and artists as [[Peter Altenberg]], [[Richard Dehmel]], [[Egon Friedell]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler]], [[Adolf Loos]], [[Heinrich Mann]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Georg Trakl]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and [[Oscar Wilde]]. After 1911, however, Kraus was usually the sole author. Kraus's work was published nearly exclusively in ''Die Fackel'', of which 922 irregularly issued numbers appeared in total. Authors who were supported by Kraus include Peter Altenberg, Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, and Georg Trakl.\n\n''Die Fackel'' targeted corruption, journalists and brutish behaviour. Notable enemies were [[Maximilian Harden]] (in the mud of the [[Harden\u2013Eulenburg affair]]), [[Moriz Benedikt]] (owner of the newspaper ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''), [[Alfred Kerr]], [[Hermann Bahr]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Imre Bekessy|de}} and [[Johann Schober]].\n\nIn 1902, Kraus published ''Sittlichkeit und Kriminalit\u00e4t'' (''Morality and Criminal Justice''), for the first time commenting on what was to become one of his main preoccupations: he attacked the general opinion of the time that it was necessary to defend sexual morality by means of criminal justice (''Der Skandal f\u00e4ngt an, wenn die Polizei ihm ein Ende macht'', ''The Scandal Starts When the Police Ends It'').<ref>quoted following ''Spr\u00fcche und Widerspr\u00fcche'' (''Sayings and Gainsayings''), Suhrkamp, Frankfurt/M. 1984, p. 42</ref> Starting in 1906, Kraus published the first of his [[aphorism]]s in ''Die Fackel''; they were collected in 1909 in the book ''Spr\u00fcche und Widerspr\u00fcche'' (''Sayings and Gainsayings'').\n\nIn addition to his writings, Kraus gave numerous highly influential public readings during his career, put on approximately 700 one-man performances between 1892 and 1936 in which he read from the dramas of [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Johann Nestroy]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and also performed [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s operettas, accompanied by piano and singing all the roles himself. [[Elias Canetti]], who regularly attended Kraus's lectures, titled the second volume of his autobiography ''\"Die Fackel\" im Ohr'' (''\"The Torch\" in the Ear'') in reference to the magazine and its author. At the peak of his popularity, Kraus's lectures attracted four thousand people, and his magazine sold forty thousand copies.<ref name=\"MATTL09\" />\n\nIn 1904, Kraus supported [[Frank Wedekind]] to make possible the staging in Vienna of his controversial play ''[[Pandora's Box (play)|Pandora's Box]]'';<ref name=\"Bru06\" /> the play told the story of a sexually enticing young dancer who rises in German society through her relationships with wealthy men but later falls into poverty and prostitution.<ref name=\"mueller\">Carl R. Mueller, Introduction to ''Frank Wedekind: Four Major Plays'', Vol 1, Lyme, NH: Smith and Krauss, 2000</ref> These plays' frank depiction of sexuality and violence, including [[lesbianism]] and an encounter with [[Jack the Ripper]],{{sfnp|Willett|1959|p=73n}} pushed against the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time. Wedekind's works are considered among the precursors of expressionism, but in 1914, when expressionist poets like [[Richard Dehmel]] began producing war propaganda, Kraus became a fierce critic of them.<ref name=\"MATTL09\">Siegfried Mattl (2009) [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&fid=4612264&jid=MIH&volumeId=6&issueId=01&aid=4612256 \"The Ambivalence of Modernism From the Weimar Republic to National Socialism and Red Vienna\"], ''Modern Intellectual History'', Volume 6, Issue 01, April 2009, pp. 223\u2013234</ref><ref name=\"Bru06\">Sascha Bru, Gunther Martens (2006) ''The invention of politics in the European avant-garde (1906\u20131940)'' pp. 52\u20135</ref>\n\nIn 1907, Kraus attacked his erstwhile benefactor Maximilian Harden because of his role in the Eulenburg trial in the first of his spectacular ''Erledigungen'' (''Dispatches'').{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n====1910\u20131919====\nAfter 1911, Kraus was the sole author of most issues of ''Die Fackel''.\n\nOne of Kraus's most influential satirical-literary techniques was his clever [[wordplay]] with quotations. One controversy arose with the text ''Die Orgie'', which exposed how the newspaper ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]'' was blatantly supporting [[Liberalism in Austria#Liberal Political Parties in Austria|Austria's Liberal Party]]'s election campaign; the text was conceived as a guerrilla prank and sent as a fake letter to the newspaper (''Die Fackel'' would publish it later in 1911); the enraged editor, who fell for the trick, responded by suing Kraus for \"disturbing the serious business of politicians and editors\".<ref name=\"Bru06\" />\n\nAfter an obituary for [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], who had been [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassinated in Sarajevo]] on 28 June 1914, ''Die Fackel'' was not published for many months. In December 1914, it appeared again with an essay \"In dieser gro\u00dfen Zeit\" (\"In this grand time\"): \"In dieser gro\u00dfen Zeit, die ich noch gekannt habe, wie sie so klein war; die wieder klein werden wird, wenn ihr dazu noch Zeit bleibt; \u2026 in dieser lauten Zeit, die da dr\u00f6hnt von der schauerlichen Symphonie der Taten, die Berichte hervorbringen, und der Berichte, welche Taten verschulden: in dieser da m\u00f6gen Sie von mir kein eigenes Wort erwarten.\"<ref>''Die Fackel'', No. 404, December 1914, p. 1</ref> (\"In this grand time, which I used to know when it was this small; which will become small again if there is time; \u2026 in this loud time that resounds from the ghastly symphony of deeds that spawn reports, and of reports that cause deeds: in this one, you may not expect a word of my own.\") In the subsequent time, Kraus wrote against the World War, and censors repeatedly confiscated or obstructed editions of ''Die Fackel''.\n\nKraus's masterpiece is generally considered to be the massive satirical play about the [[First World War]], ''Die letzten Tage der Menschheit'' (''[[The Last Days of Mankind]]''), which combines dialogue from contemporary documents with [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[fantasy]] and commentary by two characters called \"the Grumbler\" and \"the Optimist\". Kraus began to write the play in 1915 and first published it as a series of special ''Fackel'' issues in 1919. Its epilogue, \"Die letzte Nacht\" (\"The last night\") had already been published in 1918 as a special issue.\n[[Edward Timms]] has called the work a \"faulted masterpiece\" and a \"fissured text\" because the evolution of Kraus's attitude during the time of its composition (from [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] [[Conservatism|conservative]] to [[democracy|democratic]] [[republicanism|republican]]) gave the text structural inconsistencies resembling a [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]].<ref>[[Edward Timms]], ''Karl Kraus, Apocalyptic Satirist: Culture and Catastrophe in Habsburg Vienna'' (1986), 374, 380.</ref>\n\nAlso in 1919, Kraus published his collected war texts under the title ''Weltgericht'' (''World Court of Justice''). In 1920, he published the satire ''Literatur oder man wird doch da sehn'' (''Literature, or You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet'') as a reply to [[Franz Werfel]]'s ''Spiegelmensch'' (''Mirror Man''), an attack against Kraus.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:KarlKraus.jpg|thumb|Plaque of Karl Kraus on the house where he was born in [[Ji\u010d\u00edn]]]]\n\n====1920\u20131936====\nDuring January 1924, Kraus started a fight against Imre B\u00e9kessy, publisher of the tabloid ''Die Stunde'' (''The Hour''), accusing him of extorting money from restaurant owners by threatening them with bad reviews unless they paid him. B\u00e9kessy retaliated with a libel campaign against Kraus, who in turn launched an ''Erledigung'' with the catchphrase \"Hinaus aus Wien mit dem Schuft!\" (\"Throw the scoundrel out of Vienna!\"). In 1926, B\u00e9kessy indeed fled Vienna to avoid arrest. B\u00e9kessy achieved some later success when his novel ''Barabbas'' was the monthly selection of an American book club.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nA peak in Kraus's political commitment was his sensational attack in 1927 on the powerful Vienna police chief [[Johann Schober]], also a former two-term chancellor, after 89 rioters were shot dead by the police during the 1927 [[July Revolt of 1927|July Revolt]]. Kraus produced a poster that in a single sentence requested Schober's resignation; the poster was published all over Vienna and is considered an icon of 20th-century Austrian history.<ref name=\"MATTL09\" />\n\nIn 1928, the play ''Die Un\u00fcberwindlichen'' (''The Insurmountables'') was published. It included allusions to the fights against B\u00e9kessy and Schober. During that same year, Kraus also published the records of a lawsuit Kerr had filed against him after Kraus had published Kerr's war poems in ''Die Fackel'' (Kerr, having become a pacifist, did not want his earlier enthusiasm for the war exposed). In 1932, Kraus translated [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] sonnets.\n\nKraus supported the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] from at least the early 1920s,<ref name=\"MATTL09\" /> and in 1934, hoping [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] could prevent Nazism from engulfing Austria, he supported Dollfuss's coup d'\u00e9tat, which established the Austrian fascist regime.<ref name=\"MATTL09\" /> This support estranged Kraus from some of his followers.\n\nIn 1933 Kraus wrote ''Die Dritte Walpurgisnacht'' (''The Third [[Walpurgis Night]]''), of which the first fragments appeared in ''Die Fackel''. Kraus withheld full publication in part to protect his friends and followers hostile to Hitler who still lived in the Third Reich from Nazi reprisals, and in part because \"violence is no subject for polemic.\"<ref>Kraus (1934) ''Die Fackel'' Nr. 890, \"{{Lang|de|Warum die Fackel nicht erscheint|italic=no}}\", p. 26, quotation: \"Gewalt kein Objekt der Polemik\"</ref><ref>Kovacsics, Adan (2011) ''Seleci\u00f3n de art\u00edculos de \u00abDie Fackel\u00bb'', p. 524, quotation: \"la obra que Kraus escribi\u00f3 en 1933, pero que no public\u00f3, en parte, como \u00e9l mismo se\u00f1ala, porque no puede ser \u00abla violencia objeto de pol\u00e9mica ni la locura objeto de s\u00e1tira\u00bb, en parte porque tem\u00eda comprometer a sus amigos y seguidores en Alemania y ponerlos en peligro.\"</ref><ref>Freschi, Marino (1996) Preface to the Italian translation of ''The Third Walpurgis Night'', pp. XXI\u2013XXII , quotation: \"Il progetto venne bloccato dalle remore avvertite da Kraus, preoccupato di coinvolgere amici e conoscenti citati nel libro e ostili a Hitler, che ancora vivevano nel Terzo Reich.\"</ref> This satire on Nazi ideology begins with the now-famous sentence, \"{{Lang|de|Mir f\u00e4llt zu Hitler nichts ein|italic=no}}\" (\"Hitler brings nothing to my mind\"). Lengthy extracts appear in Kraus's apologia for his silence at Hitler's coming to power, \"{{Lang|de|Warum die ''Fackel'' nicht erscheint|italic=unset}}\" (\"Why ''Die Fackel'' is not published\"), a 315-page edition of the periodical. The last issue of ''Die Fackel'' appeared in February 1936. Shortly after, he fell in a collision with a bicyclist and suffered intense headaches and loss of memory. He gave his last lecture in April, and had a severe heart attack in the [[Hotel Imperial|Caf\u00e9 Imperial]] on June 10. He died in his apartment in Vienna on June 12, 1936, and was buried in the [[Zentralfriedhof]] cemetery in Vienna.\n\nKraus never married, but from 1913 until his death he had a conflict-prone but close relationship with the Baroness [[Sidonie N\u00e1dhern\u00e1 von Borut\u00edn]] (1885\u20131950). Many of his works were written in Janowitz castle, N\u00e1dherny family property. Sidonie N\u00e1dhern\u00e1 became an important pen pal to Kraus and addressee of his books and poems.<ref>[http://www.clivejames.com/karl-kraus \"The Question of Karl Kraus\"] (from ''The Revolt of the Pendulum'', 2009), ''[[Australian Literary Review]]'', March 2007, via [[Clive James|clivejames.com]]</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Kraus was [[baptism|baptized]] as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], but in 1923, disillusioned by the Church's support for the war, [[Apostasy|he left]] the Catholic Church, claiming sarcastically that he was motivated \"primarily by antisemitism\", i.e. indignation at [[Max Reinhardt]]'s use of the [[Kollegienkirche, Salzburg|Kollegienkirche]] in Salzburg as the venue for a theatrical performance.<ref>[[Edward Timms]], ''Karl Kraus, Apocalyptic Satirist: The Post-War Crisis and the Rise of the Swastika'' (2005), pp. 282\u2013283.</ref>\n\nKraus was the subject of two books by [[Thomas Szasz]], ''Karl Kraus and the Soul Doctors'' and ''Anti-Freud: Karl Kraus's Criticism of Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry'', which portray Kraus as a harsh critic of [[Sigmund Freud]] and of [[psychoanalysis]] in general.<ref>Szasz, ''Karl Kraus and the Soul-Doctors'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1977, pp. 19\u201320</ref> Other commentators, such as [[Edward Timms]], have argued that Kraus respected Freud, though with reservations about the application of some of his theories, and that his views were far less black-and-white than Szasz suggests.<ref>[[Edward Timms|Timms, Edward]], ''Karl Kraus \u2013 Apocalyptic Satirist: Culture and Catastrophe in Habsburg Vienna'' (1986). See ch.5, \"Sorcerers and Apprentices: The Encounter with Freud\", esp. pp. 107, 111\u201312.</ref>\n\n== Character ==\nKarl Kraus was a subject of controversy throughout his lifetime. [[Marcel Reich-Ranicki]] called him 'vain, self-righteous and self-important'.<ref>Harry Zohn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zMTJ6QWnaNYC&pg=PA90 ''Karl Kraus and the Critics''], Camden House, 1997, p. 90</ref> Kraus's followers saw in him an infallible authority who would do anything to help those he supported. Kraus considered posterity his ultimate audience, and reprinted ''Die Fackel'' in volume form years after it was first published.<ref name=\"Knight2004p252\">Knight, Charles A. (2004) ''Literature of Satire'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOfVePSFctgC&pg=PA252 pp. 252\u20136]</ref>\n\nA concern with language was central to Kraus's outlook, and he viewed his contemporaries' careless use of language as symptomatic of their careless treatment of the world. Viennese composer [[Ernst Krenek]] described meeting the writer in 1932: \"At a time when people were generally decrying the [[History of Shanghai#End of Old Shanghai .281937.E2.80.931945.29|Japanese bombardment of Shanghai]], I met Karl Kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems. He said something like: 'I know that everything is futile when the house is burning. But I have to do this, as long as it is at all possible; for if those who were supposed to look after commas had always made sure they were in the right place, Shanghai would not be burning'.\"<ref>[[Hans Weigel]], ''Kraus: Die Macht der Ohnmacht'' (Kraus or the power of powerlessness), Brandst\u00e4tter, 1986, p. 128. Original text: \"Als man sich gerade \u00fcber die Beschie\u00dfung von Shanghai durch die Japaner erregte und ich Karl Kraus bei einem der ber\u00fchmten Beistrich-Problemen antraf, sagte er ungef\u00e4hr: Ich wei\u00df, da\u00df das alles sinnlos ist, wenn das Haus in Brand steht. Aber solange das irgend m\u00f6glich ist, mu\u00df ich das machen, denn h\u00e4tten die Leute, die dazu verpflichtet sind, immer darauf geachtet, da\u00df die Beistriche am richtigen Platz stehen, so w\u00fcrde Shanghai nicht brennen.\u201c</ref>\n\nThe Austrian author [[Stefan Zweig]] once called Kraus \"the master of venomous ridicule\" (''der Meister des giftigen Spotts'').<ref>[[Stefan Zweig]], ''Die Welt von Gestern. Erinnerungen eines Europ\u00e4ers'' (Frankfurt am Main: Fischer, 1986), 127.</ref> Up to 1930, Kraus directed his satirical writings to figures of the center and the left of the political spectrum, as he considered the flaws of the right too self-evident to be worthy of his comment.<ref name=\"Knight2004p252\" /> Later, his responses to the Nazis included ''The Third Walpurgis Night''.\n\nTo the numerous enemies he made with the inflexibility and intensity of his partisanship, however, he was a bitter [[Misanthropy|misanthrope]] and ''poor would-be'' ([[Alfred Kerr]]). He was accused of wallowing in hateful denunciations and ''Erledigungen'' [breakings-off].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Along with [[Karl Valentin]], he is considered a master of [[gallows humor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/?q%3Dnode%2F221 |author=Marmo, Emanuela |title=Interview with Daniele Luttazzi |date=March 2004 |accessdate=May 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506133300/http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node%2F221 |archivedate=May 6, 2006 |quote=\"Quando la satira poi riesce a far ridere su un argomento talmente drammatico di cui si ride perch\u00e9 non c'\u00e8 altra soluzione possibile, si ha quella che nei cabaret di Berlino degli Anni '20 veniva chiamata la 'risata verde'. \u00c8 opportuno distinguere una satira ironica, che lavora per sottrazione, da una satira grottesca, che lavora per addizione.

Middlesex; Penguin; pp. 219\u2013220.</ref>\n\nKraus's work has been described as the culmination of a literary outlook.

He learned to play the violin at age five and the guitar at age eight under the tutelage of his father, a [[mariachi]] musician. His younger brother, [[Jorge Santana]], also became a professional guitarist. Young Carlos was heavily influenced by [[Ritchie Valens]] at a time when there were very few Mexicans in American rock and pop music. The family moved from Autl\u00e1n de Navarro to [[Tijuana]], the city on Mexico's border with California, and then San Francisco. In October 1966, in San Francisco, Santana started the [[Santana (band)|Santana Blues Band]]. By 1968, the band had begun to incorporate different types of influences into their electric blues. \"If I would go to some cat's room,\" remembered the guitarist of the band, \"he'd be listening to [[Sly Stone|Sly [Stone]]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]]; another guy to the [[The Rolling Stones|Stones]] and [[the Beatles]]. Another guy'd be listening to [[Tito Puente]] and [[Mongo Santamar\u00eda]]. Another guy'd be listening to [[Miles Davis|Miles [Davis]]] and [[John Coltrane|[John] Coltrane]]... .

King]], Javier B\u00e1tiz, [[Mike Bloomfield]], and [[John Lee Hooker]]. [[G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3]]'s mid-1960s jazz/gypsy guitar work also strongly influenced Santana's playing. Indeed, Szab\u00f3's composition \"Gypsy Queen\" was used as the second part of Santana's 1970 treatment of Peter Green's composition \"[[Black Magic Woman]]\", almost down to identical guitar licks. Santana's 2012 instrumental album ''[[Shape Shifter (album)|Shape Shifter]]'' includes a song called \"Mr. Szabo\", played in tribute in the style of G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3. Santana also credits [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Mike Bloomfield]], [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] as important influences; he considered Bloomfield a direct mentor, writing of a key meeting with Bloomfield in San Francisco in the foreword he wrote to a biography of Bloomfield, ''Michael Bloomfield: If You Love These Blues \u2013 An Oral History'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougpayne.com/carlos.htm |title=Carlos Santana Influences |publisher=Dougpayne.com |date=April 23, 1977 |accessdate=March 13, 2010}}</ref> Between the age of 10\u201312 he was sexually molested by an American man who brought him across the border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/621663/santana-says-he-was-molested-as-a-child/|title=Santana Says He Was Molested As A Child|publisher=[[mtv.com]]}}</ref> Santana lived in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]], graduated from James Lick Middle School, and in 1965 from [[Mission High School (San Francisco)|Mission High School]].

After several years spent working as a [[dishwasher]] in a diner and [[busking]] for spare change, Santana decided to become a full-time musician. In 1966 he was chosen along with other musicians to form an ad hoc band to substitute for that of an intoxicated [[Paul Butterfield]] set to play a Sunday matinee at [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]]. Graham selected the substitutes from musicians he knew primarily through his connections with the [[Butterfield Blues Band]], [[Grateful Dead]], and [[Jefferson Airplane]].  Santana's guitar playing caught the attention of both the audience and Graham.<ref>Shapiro, Marc, \"Carlos Santana: Back on Top\u201d, pages 57\u201358, St. Martin\u2019s Press, {{ISBN|0-312-26904-8}}, 2000.</ref>\n\nDuring the same year he and fellow street musicians [[David Brown (American musician)|David Brown]] (bass guitar), [[Marcus Malone]] (percussion) and [[Gregg Rolie]] (lead vocals, [[Hammond organ#B-3_/_C-3_/_RT-3_/_A-100_/_D-100_/_E-100_/_H-100_series|Hammond Organ B3]]), formed the Santana Blues Band.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p195903|pure_url=yes}}|title=Carlos Santana > Biography|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|year=2003|website=AllMusic|accessdate=June 25, 2009}}</ref> Playing a highly original blend of Latin-infused rock, jazz, blues, salsa, and African rhythms, the band gained an immediate following on the San Francisco club circuit.\n\n===Record deal, Woodstock breakthrough, and height of success: 1969\u20131972===\n[[File:Santana_(1971).png|thumb|right|250px|Trade ad for Santana's album Santana III.]]\n[[File:Santana 1973.jpg|thumb|right|250|Santana performing in Hamburg in 1973.]]\nSantana's band was signed by [[Columbia Records]], which shortened its name to simply \"[[Santana (band)|Santana]]\".<ref>Carlos Santana.\" Britannica Academic, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, September 12, 2013. academic.eb.com.ezproxy4.library.arizona.edu/levels/collegiate/article/476059. Accessed February 2, 2017.</ref> It went into the studio to record its first album in January 1969, finally laying down tracks in May that became its first album. Members were not satisfied with the release, dismissed drummer Bob Livingston, and added [[Mike Shrieve]], who had a strong background in both jazz and rock. The band then lost percussionist [[Marcus Malone]], who was charged with involuntary manslaughter.  Michael Carabello was re-enlisted in his place, bringing with him experienced [[Nicaraguan]] percussionist [[Jos\u00e9 Areas|Jose Chepito Areas]].\n\nMajor rock music promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], a Latin Music aficionado who had been a fan of Santana from its inception, arranged for the band to appear at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Music and Art Festival]] before its debut album was even released. Its set was one of the surprises of the festival, highlighted by an eleven-minute performance of a throbbing instrumental, \"[[Soul Sacrifice (song)|Soul Sacrifice]]\".  Its inclusion in the ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' film and soundtrack album vastly increased the band's popularity. Graham also suggested Santana record the [[Willie Bobo]] song \"[[Evil Ways]]\", as he felt it would get radio airplay. The band's first album, ''[[Santana (1969 album)|Santana]]'', was released in August 1969 and became a huge hit, reaching #4 on the U.S. album charts.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=Santana|publisher=Sony|year=1998|id=489542-2}}</ref>\n\nThe band's performance at Woodstock and the follow-up sound track and movie introduced them to an international audience and garnered critical acclaim.  The sudden success which followed put pressure on the group, highlighting the different musical directions Rolie and Santana were starting to go. Rolie, along with some of the other band members, wanted to emphasize a basic [[hard rock]] sound which had been a key component in establishing the band from the start. Santana, however, was increasingly interested in moving beyond his love of blues and rock and wanted more jazzy, ethereal elements in the music.  He had become fascinated with [[G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], and [[John Coltrane]], as well as developing a growing interest in [[spirituality]]. At the same time, Chepito Areas was stricken with a near-fatal [[Cerebral hemorrhage|brain hemorrhage]], and Santana hoped to continue by finding a temporary replacement (first [[Willie Bobo]], then [[Coke Escovedo]]), while others in the band, especially Michael Carabello, felt it was wrong to perform publicly without Areas. Cliques formed, and the band started to disintegrate.\n\nConsolidating the interest generated by their first album, and their highly acclaimed live performance at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, the band followed up with their second album, ''[[Abraxas (album)|Abraxas]]'', in September 1970. The album's mix of rock, blues, jazz, salsa and other influences was very well received, showing a musical maturation from their first album and refining the band's early sound. ''Abraxas'' included two of Santana's most enduring and well-known hits, \"[[Oye Como Va]]\", and \"[[Black Magic Woman|Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen]]\". ''Abraxas'' spent six weeks at #1 on the Billboard chart at the end of 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73601/chart-beat-bonus |title=Chart Beat Bonus |work=Billboard |date=November 1, 2002 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}</ref> The album remained on the charts for 88 weeks and was certified 4x platinum in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/spsantana2.html |title=Santana \u2013 Abraxas |publisher=Superseventies.com |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}</ref> In 2003 the album was ranked number 205 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref>Levy, Joe; Steven Van Zandt (2006) [2005]. \"205 | Abraxas \u2013 Santana\".

Retrieved March 9, 2006.</ref>\n\nTeenage [[San Francisco Bay Area]] guitar prodigy [[Neal Schon]] joined the Santana band in 1971, in time to complete the third album, ''[[Santana (1971 album)|Santana III]]''. The band now boasted a powerful dual-lead-guitar act that gave the album a tougher sound. The sound of the band was also helped by the return of a recuperated Chepito Areas and the assistance of Coke Escovedo in the percussion section. Enhancing the band's sound further was the support of popular Bay Area group [[Tower of Power]]'s [[horn section]], Luis Gasca of [[Malo (band)|Malo]], and other [[session musician]]s which added to both percussion and vocals, injecting more energy to the proceedings. ''Santana III'' was another success, reaching #1 on the album charts, selling two million copies, and yielding the hit \"[[No One to Depend On]]\".\n\nTension between members of the band continued, however. Along with musical differences, drug use became a problem, and Santana was deeply worried that it was affecting the band's performance. Coke Escovedo encouraged Santana to take more control of the band's musical direction, much to the dismay of some of the others who thought that the band and its sound was a collective effort. Also, financial irregularities were exposed while under the management of Stan Marcum, whom Bill Graham criticized as being incompetent. Growing resentments between Santana and Michael Carabello over lifestyle issues resulted in his departure on bad terms. James Mingo Lewis was hired at the last minute as a replacement at a concert in New York City. David Brown later left due to substance abuse problems. A [[Santana III Tour|South American tour]] was cut short in [[Lima, Peru]], due to unruly fans and to student protests against U.S. governmental policies.\n\nIn January 1972, Santana, Schon, Escovedo, and Lewis joined former [[Band of Gypsys]] drummer [[Buddy Miles]] for a concert at Hawaii's [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head Crater]], which was recorded for the album ''[[Carlos Santana & Buddy Miles! Live!]]''. The performance was erratic and uneven, but the album managed to achieve gold-record status on the weight of Santana's popularity.\n\n===''Caravanserai''===\nIn early 1972, Santana and the remaining members of the band started working on their fourth album, ''[[Caravanserai (album)|Caravanserai]]''. During the studio sessions, Santana and [[Michael Shrieve]] brought in other musicians: percussionists James Mingo Lewis and Latin-Jazz veteran, [[Armando Peraza]] replacing Michael Carabello, and bassists Tom Rutley and Doug Rauch replacing [[David Brown (American musician)|David Brown]]. Also assisting on keyboards were [[Wendy Haas]] and [[Tom Coster]]. With the unsettling influx of new players in the studio, [[Gregg Rolie]] and [[Neal Schon]] decided that it was time to leave after the completion of the album, even though both contributed to the session. Rolie returned home to Seattle; later, along with Schon, both became founding members of [[Journey (band)|Journey]].\n\nWhen ''[[Caravanserai (album)|Caravanserai]]'' did emerge in 1972, it marked a strong change in musical direction towards [[jazz fusion]]. The album received critical praise, but CBS executive [[Clive Davis]] warned Santana and the band that it would sabotage the band's position as a \"[[Top 40]]\" act. Nevertheless, over the years, the album achieved platinum status. The difficulties Santana and the band went through during this period were chronicled in [[Ben Fong-Torres]]' ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' 1972 cover story \"The Resurrection of Carlos Santana\".\n\nSantana married Deborah King in 1973. She is the daughter of late blues singer and guitarist [[Saunders King]]. They have three children: [[Salvador Santana|Salvador]], Stella and Angelica. Together with wife Deborah, Santana founded a not-for-profit organization, the Milagro (\"Miracle\") Foundation, which provides financial aid for educational, medical, and other needs. On October 19, 2007, Deborah Santana filed for divorce citing \"[[irreconcilable differences]]\" after 34 years of marriage.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Shifting styles and spirituality: 1972\u20131979===\n[[File:Carlos Santana-2 1978 by Chris Hakkens.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Santana during his [[Santana European Tour 1978|European tour]] in the Netherlands in 1978]]\n\nIn 1972, Santana became interested in the pioneering fusion band the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] and its guitarist, [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]. Aware of Santana's interest in meditation, McLaughlin introduced Santana, and his wife Deborah, to his guru, [[Sri Chinmoy]]. Chinmoy accepted them as disciples in 1973. Santana was given the name '''Devadip''', meaning \"The lamp, light and eye of God\".  Santana and McLaughlin recorded an album together, ''[[Love Devotion Surrender|Love, Devotion, Surrender]]'' (1973) with members of Santana and the Mahavishnu Orchestra, along with percussionist [[Don Alias]] and organist [[Larry Young (musician)|Larry Young]], both of whom had made appearances, along with McLaughlin, on [[Miles Davis]]' classic 1970 album ''[[Bitches Brew]]''.\n\nIn 1973, Santana, having obtained legal rights to the band's name, ''[[Santana (band)|Santana]]'', formed a new version of the band with [[Armando Peraza]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Areas|Chepito Areas]] on percussion, [[Doug Rauch]] on bass, [[Michael Shrieve]] on drums, and [[Tom Coster]] and Richard Kermode on keyboards. Santana later was able to recruit jazz vocalist [[Leon Thomas]] for the [[Caravanserai Tour|tour supporting ''Caravanserai'']] in Japan on July 3 and 4, 1973, which was recorded for the 1974 live, sprawling, high-energy triple vinyl LP fusion album ''[[Lotus (Santana album)|Lotus]]''. CBS records would not allow its release unless the material was condensed. Santana did not agree to those terms, and ''Lotus'' was available in the U.S. only as an expensive, imported, three-record set. The group later went into the studio and recorded ''[[Welcome (Santana album)|Welcome]]'' (1973), which further reflected Santana's interests in [[jazz fusion]] and his increasing commitment to the spiritual life of Sri Chinmoy.\n\n[[File:Carlos Santana 123176.jpg|thumb|right|New Year's Eve 1976 at the [[Cow Palace]] in San Francisco]]\n\nA collaboration with [[John Coltrane]]'s widow, [[Alice Coltrane]], ''[[Illuminations (Alice Coltrane and Carlos Santana album)|Illuminations]]'' (1974), followed. The album delved into [[avant-garde]] esoteric [[free jazz]], [[East India|Eastern Indian]] and classical influences with other ex-Miles Davis sidemen [[Jack DeJohnette]] and [[Dave Holland]]. Soon after, Santana replaced his band members again. This time Kermode, Thomas and Rauch departed from the group and were replaced by vocalist [[Leon Patillo]] (later a successful [[Contemporary Christian music|Contemporary Christian]] artist) and returning bassist David Brown. He also recruited soprano saxophonist, Jules Broussard for the lineup. The band recorded one studio album ''[[Borboletta]]'', which was released in 1974. Drummer [[Leon \"Ndugu\" Chancler]] later joined the band as a replacement for [[Michael Shrieve]], who left to pursue a solo career.\n\n[[File:Carlos_Santana_1978_by_Chris_Hakkens.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Santana during his [[Santana European Tour 1978|European tour]] in the Netherlands in 1978]]\nBy this time, [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s management company had assumed responsibility for the affairs of the group. Graham was critical of Santana's move into jazz and felt he needed to concentrate on getting ''Santana'' back into the charts with the edgy, streetwise [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] sound that had made them famous. Santana himself was seeing that the group's direction was alienating many fans. Although the albums and performances were given good reviews by critics in jazz and [[jazz fusion]] circles, sales had plummeted.\n\nSantana, along with [[Tom Coster]], producer David Rubinson, and Chancler, formed yet another version of ''Santana'', adding vocalist Greg Walker. The 1976 album ''[[Amigos (Santana album)|Amigos]]'', which featured the songs \"Dance, Sister, Dance\" and \"Let It Shine\", had a strong funk and Latin sound. The album received considerable airplay on FM [[album-oriented rock]] stations with the instrumental \"[[Europa (Earth's Cry Heaven's Smile)]]\" and re-introduced ''Santana'' to the charts. In 1976 ''Rolling Stone'' ran a second cover story on ''Santana'' entitled \"Santana Comes Home\".\n\nThe albums conceived through the late 1970s followed the same formula, although with several lineup changes. Among the new personnel who joined was current percussionist Raul Rekow, who joined in early 1977. Most notable of the band's commercial efforts of this era was a version of the 1960s [[The Zombies|Zombies]] hit, \"[[She's Not There]]\", on the 1977 double album ''[[Moonflower (album)|Moonflower]]''.\n\nSantana recorded two solo projects in this time: ''[[Oneness (Carlos Santana album)|Oneness: Silver Dreams \u2013 Golden Reality]]'', in 1979 and ''[[The Swing of Delight]]'' in 1980, which featured [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Ron Carter]] and [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]].\n\nThe pressures and temptations of being a high-profile rock musician and requirements of the spiritual lifestyle which [[guru]] [[Sri Chinmoy]] and his followers demanded were in conflict, and imposed considerable stress upon Santana's lifestyle and marriage. He was becoming increasingly disillusioned with what he thought were the unreasonable rules that Chinmoy imposed on his life, and in particular with his refusal to allow Santana and Deborah to start a family. He felt too that his fame was being used to increase the guru's visibility. Santana and Deborah eventually ended their relationship with Chinmoy in 1982.\n\n===The 1980s===\n[[File:Santana 1984.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Santana in [[Barcelona, Spain]], 1984]]\n[[File:Dylan-Baez-Santana.jpg|thumb|220px|left|L to R: [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], and Santana in Hamburg, May 1984]]\n\nMore radio-friendly singles followed from Santana and the band. \"Winning\" in 1981 (from ''[[Zebop!]]'') and \"Hold On\" (a remake of Canadian artist [[Ian Thomas (Canadian musician)|Ian Thomas]]' song) in 1982 both reached the top twenty. After his break with Sri Chinmoy, Santana went into the studio to record another solo album with Keith Olson and legendary R&B producer [[Jerry Wexler]]. The 1983 album ''[[Havana Moon]]'' revisited Santana's early musical experiences in Tijuana with [[Bo Diddley]]'s \"[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love]]\" and the title cut, [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"Havana Moon\".  The album's guests included [[Booker T. Jones]], [[the Fabulous Thunderbirds]], [[Willie Nelson]] and even Santana's father's [[mariachi]] orchestra. Santana again paid tribute to his early rock roots by doing the film score to ''[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]'', which was based on the life of rock and roll legend [[Ritchie Valens]] and starred [[Lou Diamond Phillips]].\n\nThe band ''Santana'' returned in 1985 with a new album, ''[[Beyond Appearances]]'', and two years later with ''[[Freedom (Santana album)|Freedom]]''.\n\nGrowing weary of trying to appease record company executives with formulaic hit records, Santana took great pleasure in jamming and making guest appearances with notables such as the jazz fusion group [[Weather Report]], jazz pianist [[McCoy Tyner]], Blues legend [[John Lee Hooker]], Frank Franklin, [[Living Colour]] guitarist [[Vernon Reid]], and West African singer [[Salif Keita]]. He and [[Mickey Hart]] of the [[Grateful Dead]] later recorded and performed with Nigerian drummer [[Babatunde Olatunji]], who conceived one of Santana's famous 1960s drum jams, \"[[Drums of Passion#\"Jin-Go-Lo-Ba\"|Jingo]]\". In 1988 Santana organized a reunion with past members from the Santana band for a [[Viva Santana! Tour|series of concert dates]]. CBS records released a 20-year retrospective of the band's accomplishments with ''[[Viva Santana!]]'' double CD compilation. That same year Santana formed an all-instrumental group featuring jazz legend [[Wayne Shorter]] on tenor and soprano saxophone. The group also included [[Patrice Rushen]] on keyboards, [[Alphonso Johnson]] on bass, [[Armando Peraza]] and Chepito Areas on percussion, and [[Leon \"Ndugu\" Chancler]] on drums. They toured briefly and received much acclaim from the music press, who compared the effort with the era of ''Caravanserai'' (1972).  Santana released another solo record, ''[[Blues for Salvador]]'' (1987), which won a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].\n\nIn 1990, Santana left Columbia Records after twenty-two years and signed with [[PolyGram|Polygram]]. The following year he made a guest appearance on [[Ottmar Liebert]]'s album, ''Solo Para Ti'' (1991), on the songs \"Reaching out 2 U\" and on a cover of his own song, \"Samba Pa Ti\". In 1992, Santana hired [[jam band]] [[Phish]] as his opening act.<ref>{{cite web |title=Two sets of Phish opening for Santana, summers '92 and '96 |url=http://kdrt.org/audio/two-sets-phish-opening-santana-summers-92-and-96 |website=KDRT 95.7FM Davis |accessdate=30 August 2019 |language=en |date=3 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Return to commercial success===\n[[File:Carlos Santana crop right.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Santana performing in 2000]]\nSantana kicked off the 1990s with a new album ''[[Spirits Dancing in the Flesh]]'' in 1990. This was followed by ''[[Milagro (Santana album)|Milagro]]'' in 1992, a live album ''[[Sacred Fire: Live in South America|Sacred Fire]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Santana Brothers|Brothers]]'' (a collaboration with his brother Jorge and nephew Carlos Hernandez) in 1994. But sales were relatively poor. Santana toured widely over the next few years but there were no further new album releases, and eventually, he was even without a recording contract. However, [[Arista Records]]' [[Clive Davis]], who had worked with Santana at [[Columbia Records]], signed him and encouraged him to record a star-studded album with mostly younger artists. The result was 1999's ''[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]'', which included collaborations with [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]], [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]] of [[Matchbox Twenty]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Wyclef Jean]], [[CeeLo Green]], [[Man\u00e1]], [[Dave Matthews]], [[KC Porter]], [[J. B. Eckl]], and others.\n\nHowever, the lead single was what grabbed the attention of both fans and the music industry. \"[[Smooth (song)|Smooth]]\", a dynamic [[Cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (music)|cha-cha]] stop-start number co-written and sung by [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]] of [[Matchbox Twenty]], was laced throughout with Santana's [[fill (music)|guitar fills]] and runs. The track's energy was immediately apparent on radio, and it was played on a wide variety of station formats. \"Smooth\" spent twelve weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming in the process the last #1 single of the 1990s. The music video, set on a hot [[barrio]] street, was also very popular. ''Supernatural'' reached number one on the US album charts and the follow-up single, \"[[Maria Maria]]\", featuring the [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] duo [[the Product G&B]], also hit number one, spending ten weeks there in the spring of 2000. ''Supernatural'' eventually shipped over 15 million copies in the United States, and won 8 [[Grammy Awards]] including Album of the Year, making it Santana's most successful album.\n\nCarlos Santana, alongside the classic ''Santana'' lineup of their first two albums, was inducted as an individual, into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998. He performed \"Black Magic Woman\" with the writer of the song, Fleetwood Mac's founder [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]. Green was inducted the same night.\n\nIn 2000, ''Supernatural'' won nine [[Grammy Award]]s (eight for Santana personally), including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] for \"Smooth\", and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for Thomas and [[Itaal Shur]].

He has also used the Audiotech Guitar Products 1x6 Rack Mount Audio Switcher in rehearsals for the 2008 \"Live Your Light\" tour.\n\nSantana uses two different guitar picks: the large triangular Dunlop he has used for so many years, and the [[V-Picks Guitar Picks|V-Pick]] Freakishly Large Round.\n\n=== Amplifiers ===\nCarlos Santana's distinctive guitar tone is produced by PRS Santana signature guitars plugged into multiple amplifiers. The amps consist of a [[Mesa Boogie]] Mark I, Dumble [[Distortion (music)|Overdrive]] Reverb and more recently a Bludotone amplifier. Santana compares the tonal qualities of each amplifier to that of a singer producing head/nasal tones, chest tones, and belly tones. A three-way amp switcher is employed on Carlos's pedal board to enable him to switch between amps. Often the unique tones of each amplifier are blended together, complementing each other producing a richer tone.\n\nHe also put the \"Boogie\" in Mesa Boogie. Santana is credited with coining the popular Mesa amplifier name when he tried one and exclaimed, \"That little thing really Boogies!\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mesa Boogie Story \u2013 a history|publisher= Mesaboogie.com|url= http://www.mesaboogie.com/US/Smith/our_story.html|accessdate= June 14, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140220030205/http://www.mesaboogie.com/US/Smith/our_story.html|archivedate= February 20, 2014|df= mdy}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, Santana combines a Mesa/Boogie Mark I head running through a Boogie cabinet with [[Altec Lansing|Altec]] 417-8H (or recently [[JBL (company)|JBL]] E120s) speakers, and a [[Dumble Amplifiers|Dumble]] Overdrive Reverb and/or a Dumble Overdrive Special running through a Brown or [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] 4x12 cabinet with [[Celestion]] G12M \"Greenback\" speakers, depending on the desired sound. [[Shure]] KSM-32 microphones are used to pick up the sound, going to the [[Public address|PA]]. Additionally, a [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] Cyber-Twin Amp is mostly used at home.\n\nDuring his early career Santana used a GMT transistor amplifier stack and a silverface [[Fender Twin]]. The GMT 226A rig was used at the Woodstock concert as well as during recording Santana's debut album.

Its sound featured his melodic, blues-based lines set against Latin and African rhythms played on percussion instruments such as [[timbales]] and [[conga]]s not generally heard in rock. Santana continued to work in these forms over the decades that followed. He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s. In 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine listed Santana at number 20 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-guitarists-153675/carlos-santana-2-156054/ |title=100 Greatest Guitarists''; ''Rolling Stone'' |work=Rolling Stone |date=December 18, 2015 |accessdate=August 12, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730235138/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-guitarists-153675/carlos-santana-2-156054/ |archivedate=July 30, 2018 }}</ref> He has won 10 [[Grammy Awards]] and three [[Latin Grammy Awards]],<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=santana-p13645/charts-awards/grammy-awards|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|title=Santana received 10 Grammy Awards and 3 Latin Grammy Awards|year=1999|accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> and was inducted along with Santana into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/santana|title=Santana|publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nSantana was born in [[Autl\u00e1n|Autl\u00e1n de Navarro]], [[Jalisco]], Mexico. He learned to play the violin at age five and the guitar at age eight under the tutelage of his father, a [[mariachi]] musician. His younger brother, [[Jorge Santana]], also became a professional guitarist. Young Carlos was heavily influenced by [[Ritchie Valens]] at a time when there were very few Mexicans in American rock and pop music. The family moved from Autl\u00e1n de Navarro to [[Tijuana]], the city on Mexico's border with California, and then San Francisco. In October 1966, in San Francisco, Santana started the [[Santana (band)|Santana Blues Band]]. By 1968, the band had begun to incorporate different types of influences into their electric blues. \"If I would go to some cat's room,\" remembered the guitarist of the band, \"he'd be listening to [[Sly Stone|Sly [Stone]]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]]; another guy to the [[The Rolling Stones|Stones]] and [[the Beatles]]. Another guy'd be listening to [[Tito Puente]] and [[Mongo Santamar\u00eda]]. Another guy'd be listening to [[Miles Davis|Miles [Davis]]] and [[John Coltrane|[John] Coltrane]]... .

King]], Javier B\u00e1tiz, [[Mike Bloomfield]], and [[John Lee Hooker]]. [[G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3]]'s mid-1960s jazz/gypsy guitar work also strongly influenced Santana's playing. Indeed, Szab\u00f3's composition \"Gypsy Queen\" was used as the second part of Santana's 1970 treatment of Peter Green's composition \"[[Black Magic Woman]]\", almost down to identical guitar licks. Santana's 2012 instrumental album ''[[Shape Shifter (album)|Shape Shifter]]'' includes a song called \"Mr. Szabo\", played in tribute in the style of G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3. Santana also credits [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Mike Bloomfield]], [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] as important influences; he considered Bloomfield a direct mentor, writing of a key meeting with Bloomfield in San Francisco in the foreword he wrote to a biography of Bloomfield, ''Michael Bloomfield: If You Love These Blues \u2013 An Oral History'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougpayne.com/carlos.htm |title=Carlos Santana Influences |publisher=Dougpayne.com |date=April 23, 1977 |accessdate=March 13, 2010}}</ref> Between the age of 10\u201312 he was sexually molested by an American man who brought him across the border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/621663/santana-says-he-was-molested-as-a-child/|title=Santana Says He Was Molested As A Child|publisher=[[mtv.com]]}}</ref> Santana lived in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]], graduated from James Lick Middle School, and in 1965 from [[Mission High School (San Francisco)|Mission High School]].

After several years spent working as a [[dishwasher]] in a diner and [[busking]] for spare change, Santana decided to become a full-time musician. In 1966 he was chosen along with other musicians to form an ad hoc band to substitute for that of an intoxicated [[Paul Butterfield]] set to play a Sunday matinee at [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]]. Graham selected the substitutes from musicians he knew primarily through his connections with the [[Butterfield Blues Band]], [[Grateful Dead]], and [[Jefferson Airplane]].

Its inclusion in the ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' film and soundtrack album vastly increased the band's popularity. Graham also suggested Santana record the [[Willie Bobo]] song \"[[Evil Ways]]\", as he felt it would get radio airplay. The band's first album, ''[[Santana (1969 album)|Santana]]'', was released in August 1969 and became a huge hit, reaching #4 on the U.S. album charts.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=Santana|publisher=Sony|year=1998|id=489542-2}}</ref>\n\nThe band's performance at Woodstock and the follow-up sound track and movie introduced them to an international audience and garnered critical acclaim.  The sudden success which followed put pressure on the group, highlighting the different musical directions Rolie and Santana were starting to go. Rolie, along with some of the other band members, wanted to emphasize a basic [[hard rock]] sound which had been a key component in establishing the band from the start. Santana, however, was increasingly interested in moving beyond his love of blues and rock and wanted more jazzy, ethereal elements in the music.  He had become fascinated with [[G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], and [[John Coltrane]], as well as developing a growing interest in [[spirituality]]. At the same time, Chepito Areas was stricken with a near-fatal [[Cerebral hemorrhage|brain hemorrhage]], and Santana hoped to continue by finding a temporary replacement (first [[Willie Bobo]], then [[Coke Escovedo]]), while others in the band, especially Michael Carabello, felt it was wrong to perform publicly without Areas. Cliques formed, and the band started to disintegrate.\n\nConsolidating the interest generated by their first album, and their highly acclaimed live performance at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, the band followed up with their second album, ''[[Abraxas (album)|Abraxas]]'', in September 1970. The album's mix of rock, blues, jazz, salsa and other influences was very well received, showing a musical maturation from their first album and refining the band's early sound. ''Abraxas'' included two of Santana's most enduring and well-known hits, \"[[Oye Como Va]]\", and \"[[Black Magic Woman|Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen]]\". ''Abraxas'' spent six weeks at #1 on the Billboard chart at the end of 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73601/chart-beat-bonus |title=Chart Beat Bonus |work=Billboard |date=November 1, 2002 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}</ref> The album remained on the charts for 88 weeks and was certified 4x platinum in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/spsantana2.html |title=Santana \u2013 Abraxas |publisher=Superseventies.com |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}</ref> In 2003 the album was ranked number 205 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref>Levy, Joe; Steven Van Zandt (2006) [2005]. \"205 | Abraxas \u2013 Santana\".

Retrieved March 9, 2006.</ref>\n\nTeenage [[San Francisco Bay Area]] guitar prodigy [[Neal Schon]] joined the Santana band in 1971, in time to complete the third album, ''[[Santana (1971 album)|Santana III]]''. The band now boasted a powerful dual-lead-guitar act that gave the album a tougher sound. The sound of the band was also helped by the return of a recuperated Chepito Areas and the assistance of Coke Escovedo in the percussion section. Enhancing the band's sound further was the support of popular Bay Area group [[Tower of Power]]'s [[horn section]], Luis Gasca of [[Malo (band)|Malo]], and other [[session musician]]s which added to both percussion and vocals, injecting more energy to the proceedings. ''Santana III'' was another success, reaching #1 on the album charts, selling two million copies, and yielding the hit \"[[No One to Depend On]]\".\n\nTension between members of the band continued, however. Along with musical differences, drug use became a problem, and Santana was deeply worried that it was affecting the band's performance. Coke Escovedo encouraged Santana to take more control of the band's musical direction, much to the dismay of some of the others who thought that the band and its sound was a collective effort. Also, financial irregularities were exposed while under the management of Stan Marcum, whom Bill Graham criticized as being incompetent. Growing resentments between Santana and Michael Carabello over lifestyle issues resulted in his departure on bad terms. James Mingo Lewis was hired at the last minute as a replacement at a concert in New York City. David Brown later left due to substance abuse problems. A [[Santana III Tour|South American tour]] was cut short in [[Lima, Peru]], due to unruly fans and to student protests against U.S. governmental policies.\n\nIn January 1972, Santana, Schon, Escovedo, and Lewis joined former [[Band of Gypsys]] drummer [[Buddy Miles]] for a concert at Hawaii's [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head Crater]], which was recorded for the album ''[[Carlos Santana & Buddy Miles! Live!]]''. The performance was erratic and uneven, but the album managed to achieve gold-record status on the weight of Santana's popularity.\n\n===''Caravanserai''===\nIn early 1972, Santana and the remaining members of the band started working on their fourth album, ''[[Caravanserai (album)|Caravanserai]]''. During the studio sessions, Santana and [[Michael Shrieve]] brought in other musicians: percussionists James Mingo Lewis and Latin-Jazz veteran, [[Armando Peraza]] replacing Michael Carabello, and bassists Tom Rutley and Doug Rauch replacing [[David Brown (American musician)|David Brown]]. Also assisting on keyboards were [[Wendy Haas]] and [[Tom Coster]]. With the unsettling influx of new players in the studio, [[Gregg Rolie]] and [[Neal Schon]] decided that it was time to leave after the completion of the album, even though both contributed to the session. Rolie returned home to Seattle; later, along with Schon, both became founding members of [[Journey (band)|Journey]].\n\nWhen ''[[Caravanserai (album)|Caravanserai]]'' did emerge in 1972, it marked a strong change in musical direction towards [[jazz fusion]]. The album received critical praise, but CBS executive [[Clive Davis]] warned Santana and the band that it would sabotage the band's position as a \"[[Top 40]]\" act. Nevertheless, over the years, the album achieved platinum status. The difficulties Santana and the band went through during this period were chronicled in [[Ben Fong-Torres]]' ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' 1972 cover story \"The Resurrection of Carlos Santana\".\n\nSantana married Deborah King in 1973. She is the daughter of late blues singer and guitarist [[Saunders King]]. They have three children: [[Salvador Santana|Salvador]], Stella and Angelica. Together with wife Deborah, Santana founded a not-for-profit organization, the Milagro (\"Miracle\") Foundation, which provides financial aid for educational, medical, and other needs. On October 19, 2007, Deborah Santana filed for divorce citing \"[[irreconcilable differences]]\" after 34 years of marriage.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Shifting styles and spirituality: 1972\u20131979===\n[[File:Carlos Santana-2 1978 by Chris Hakkens.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Santana during his [[Santana European Tour 1978|European tour]] in the Netherlands in 1978]]\n\nIn 1972, Santana became interested in the pioneering fusion band the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] and its guitarist, [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]. Aware of Santana's interest in meditation, McLaughlin introduced Santana, and his wife Deborah, to his guru, [[Sri Chinmoy]]. Chinmoy accepted them as disciples in 1973. Santana was given the name '''Devadip''', meaning \"The lamp, light and eye of God\".  Santana and McLaughlin recorded an album together, ''[[Love Devotion Surrender|Love, Devotion, Surrender]]'' (1973) with members of Santana and the Mahavishnu Orchestra, along with percussionist [[Don Alias]] and organist [[Larry Young (musician)|Larry Young]], both of whom had made appearances, along with McLaughlin, on [[Miles Davis]]' classic 1970 album ''[[Bitches Brew]]''.\n\nIn 1973, Santana, having obtained legal rights to the band's name, ''[[Santana (band)|Santana]]'', formed a new version of the band with [[Armando Peraza]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Areas|Chepito Areas]] on percussion, [[Doug Rauch]] on bass, [[Michael Shrieve]] on drums, and [[Tom Coster]] and Richard Kermode on keyboards. Santana later was able to recruit jazz vocalist [[Leon Thomas]] for the [[Caravanserai Tour|tour supporting ''Caravanserai'']] in Japan on July 3 and 4, 1973, which was recorded for the 1974 live, sprawling, high-energy triple vinyl LP fusion album ''[[Lotus (Santana album)|Lotus]]''. CBS records would not allow its release unless the material was condensed. Santana did not agree to those terms, and ''Lotus'' was available in the U.S. only as an expensive, imported, three-record set. The group later went into the studio and recorded ''[[Welcome (Santana album)|Welcome]]'' (1973), which further reflected Santana's interests in [[jazz fusion]] and his increasing commitment to the spiritual life of Sri Chinmoy.\n\n[[File:Carlos Santana 123176.jpg|thumb|right|New Year's Eve 1976 at the [[Cow Palace]] in San Francisco]]\n\nA collaboration with [[John Coltrane]]'s widow, [[Alice Coltrane]], ''[[Illuminations (Alice Coltrane and Carlos Santana album)|Illuminations]]'' (1974), followed. The album delved into [[avant-garde]] esoteric [[free jazz]], [[East India|Eastern Indian]] and classical influences with other ex-Miles Davis sidemen [[Jack DeJohnette]] and [[Dave Holland]]. Soon after, Santana replaced his band members again. This time Kermode, Thomas and Rauch departed from the group and were replaced by vocalist [[Leon Patillo]] (later a successful [[Contemporary Christian music|Contemporary Christian]] artist) and returning bassist David Brown. He also recruited soprano saxophonist, Jules Broussard for the lineup. The band recorded one studio album ''[[Borboletta]]'', which was released in 1974. Drummer [[Leon \"Ndugu\" Chancler]] later joined the band as a replacement for [[Michael Shrieve]], who left to pursue a solo career.\n\n[[File:Carlos_Santana_1978_by_Chris_Hakkens.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Santana during his [[Santana European Tour 1978|European tour]] in the Netherlands in 1978]]\nBy this time, [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s management company had assumed responsibility for the affairs of the group. Graham was critical of Santana's move into jazz and felt he needed to concentrate on getting ''Santana'' back into the charts with the edgy, streetwise [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] sound that had made them famous. Santana himself was seeing that the group's direction was alienating many fans. Although the albums and performances were given good reviews by critics in jazz and [[jazz fusion]] circles, sales had plummeted.\n\nSantana, along with [[Tom Coster]], producer David Rubinson, and Chancler, formed yet another version of ''Santana'', adding vocalist Greg Walker. The 1976 album ''[[Amigos (Santana album)|Amigos]]'', which featured the songs \"Dance, Sister, Dance\" and \"Let It Shine\", had a strong funk and Latin sound. The album received considerable airplay on FM [[album-oriented rock]] stations with the instrumental \"[[Europa (Earth's Cry Heaven's Smile)]]\" and re-introduced ''Santana'' to the charts. In 1976 ''Rolling Stone'' ran a second cover story on ''Santana'' entitled \"Santana Comes Home\".\n\nThe albums conceived through the late 1970s followed the same formula, although with several lineup changes. Among the new personnel who joined was current percussionist Raul Rekow, who joined in early 1977. Most notable of the band's commercial efforts of this era was a version of the 1960s [[The Zombies|Zombies]] hit, \"[[She's Not There]]\", on the 1977 double album ''[[Moonflower (album)|Moonflower]]''.\n\nSantana recorded two solo projects in this time: ''[[Oneness (Carlos Santana album)|Oneness: Silver Dreams \u2013 Golden Reality]]'', in 1979 and ''[[The Swing of Delight]]'' in 1980, which featured [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Ron Carter]] and [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]].\n\nThe pressures and temptations of being a high-profile rock musician and requirements of the spiritual lifestyle which [[guru]] [[Sri Chinmoy]] and his followers demanded were in conflict, and imposed considerable stress upon Santana's lifestyle and marriage. He was becoming increasingly disillusioned with what he thought were the unreasonable rules that Chinmoy imposed on his life, and in particular with his refusal to allow Santana and Deborah to start a family. He felt too that his fame was being used to increase the guru's visibility. Santana and Deborah eventually ended their relationship with Chinmoy in 1982.\n\n===The 1980s===\n[[File:Santana 1984.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Santana in [[Barcelona, Spain]], 1984]]\n[[File:Dylan-Baez-Santana.jpg|thumb|220px|left|L to R: [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], and Santana in Hamburg, May 1984]]\n\nMore radio-friendly singles followed from Santana and the band. \"Winning\" in 1981 (from ''[[Zebop!]]'') and \"Hold On\" (a remake of Canadian artist [[Ian Thomas (Canadian musician)|Ian Thomas]]' song) in 1982 both reached the top twenty. After his break with Sri Chinmoy, Santana went into the studio to record another solo album with Keith Olson and legendary R&B producer [[Jerry Wexler]]. The 1983 album ''[[Havana Moon]]'' revisited Santana's early musical experiences in Tijuana with [[Bo Diddley]]'s \"[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love]]\" and the title cut, [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"Havana Moon\".  The album's guests included [[Booker T. Jones]], [[the Fabulous Thunderbirds]], [[Willie Nelson]] and even Santana's father's [[mariachi]] orchestra. Santana again paid tribute to his early rock roots by doing the film score to ''[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]'', which was based on the life of rock and roll legend [[Ritchie Valens]] and starred [[Lou Diamond Phillips]].\n\nThe band ''Santana'' returned in 1985 with a new album, ''[[Beyond Appearances]]'', and two years later with ''[[Freedom (Santana album)|Freedom]]''.\n\nGrowing weary of trying to appease record company executives with formulaic hit records, Santana took great pleasure in jamming and making guest appearances with notables such as the jazz fusion group [[Weather Report]], jazz pianist [[McCoy Tyner]], Blues legend [[John Lee Hooker]], Frank Franklin, [[Living Colour]] guitarist [[Vernon Reid]], and West African singer [[Salif Keita]]. He and [[Mickey Hart]] of the [[Grateful Dead]] later recorded and performed with Nigerian drummer [[Babatunde Olatunji]], who conceived one of Santana's famous 1960s drum jams, \"[[Drums of Passion#\"Jin-Go-Lo-Ba\"|Jingo]]\". In 1988 Santana organized a reunion with past members from the Santana band for a [[Viva Santana! Tour|series of concert dates]]. CBS records released a 20-year retrospective of the band's accomplishments with ''[[Viva Santana!]]'' double CD compilation. That same year Santana formed an all-instrumental group featuring jazz legend [[Wayne Shorter]] on tenor and soprano saxophone. The group also included [[Patrice Rushen]] on keyboards, [[Alphonso Johnson]] on bass, [[Armando Peraza]] and Chepito Areas on percussion, and [[Leon \"Ndugu\" Chancler]] on drums. They toured briefly and received much acclaim from the music press, who compared the effort with the era of ''Caravanserai'' (1972).  Santana released another solo record, ''[[Blues for Salvador]]'' (1987), which won a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].\n\nIn 1990, Santana left Columbia Records after twenty-two years and signed with [[PolyGram|Polygram]]. The following year he made a guest appearance on [[Ottmar Liebert]]'s album, ''Solo Para Ti'' (1991), on the songs \"Reaching out 2 U\" and on a cover of his own song, \"Samba Pa Ti\". In 1992, Santana hired [[jam band]] [[Phish]] as his opening act.<ref>{{cite web |title=Two sets of Phish opening for Santana, summers '92 and '96 |url=http://kdrt.org/audio/two-sets-phish-opening-santana-summers-92-and-96 |website=KDRT 95.7FM Davis |accessdate=30 August 2019 |language=en |date=3 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Return to commercial success===\n[[File:Carlos Santana crop right.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Santana performing in 2000]]\nSantana kicked off the 1990s with a new album ''[[Spirits Dancing in the Flesh]]'' in 1990. This was followed by ''[[Milagro (Santana album)|Milagro]]'' in 1992, a live album ''[[Sacred Fire: Live in South America|Sacred Fire]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Santana Brothers|Brothers]]'' (a collaboration with his brother Jorge and nephew Carlos Hernandez) in 1994. But sales were relatively poor. Santana toured widely over the next few years but there were no further new album releases, and eventually, he was even without a recording contract. However, [[Arista Records]]' [[Clive Davis]], who had worked with Santana at [[Columbia Records]], signed him and encouraged him to record a star-studded album with mostly younger artists. The result was 1999's ''[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]'', which included collaborations with [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]], [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]] of [[Matchbox Twenty]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Wyclef Jean]], [[CeeLo Green]], [[Man\u00e1]], [[Dave Matthews]], [[KC Porter]], [[J. B. Eckl]], and others.\n\nHowever, the lead single was what grabbed the attention of both fans and the music industry. \"[[Smooth (song)|Smooth]]\", a dynamic [[Cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (music)|cha-cha]] stop-start number co-written and sung by [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]] of [[Matchbox Twenty]], was laced throughout with Santana's [[fill (music)|guitar fills]] and runs. The track's energy was immediately apparent on radio, and it was played on a wide variety of station formats. \"Smooth\" spent twelve weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming in the process the last #1 single of the 1990s. The music video, set on a hot [[barrio]] street, was also very popular. ''Supernatural'' reached number one on the US album charts and the follow-up single, \"[[Maria Maria]]\", featuring the [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] duo [[the Product G&B]], also hit number one, spending ten weeks there in the spring of 2000. ''Supernatural'' eventually shipped over 15 million copies in the United States, and won 8 [[Grammy Awards]] including Album of the Year, making it Santana's most successful album.\n\nCarlos Santana, alongside the classic ''Santana'' lineup of their first two albums, was inducted as an individual, into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998. He performed \"Black Magic Woman\" with the writer of the song, Fleetwood Mac's founder [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]. Green was inducted the same night.\n\nIn 2000, ''Supernatural'' won nine [[Grammy Award]]s (eight for Santana personally), including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] for \"Smooth\", and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for Thomas and [[Itaal Shur]]. Santana's acceptance speeches described his feelings about music's place in one's spiritual existence. Later that year at the [[Latin Grammy Awards]] he won three awards including [[Latin Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. In 2001, Santana's guitar skills were featured in [[Michael Jackson]]'s song \"Whatever Happens\", from the album ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]''.\n \nIn 2002, Santana released ''[[Shaman (album)|Shaman]]'', revisiting the ''Supernatural'' format of guest artists including [[Citizen Cope]], [[P.O.D.]] and [[Seal (musician)|Seal]]. Although the album was not the runaway success its predecessor had been, it produced two radio-friendly hits. \"[[The Game of Love (Santana song)|The Game of Love]]\" featuring [[Michelle Branch]], rose to number five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and spent many weeks at the top of the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, and \"[[Why Don't You & I]]\" written by and featuring [[Chad Kroeger]] from the group [[Nickelback]] (the original and a remix with [[Alex Band]] from the group [[the Calling]] were combined towards chart performance) which reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100. \"The Game of Love\" went on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]]. In the same year, he was inducted into the [[International Latin Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news|title=International Latin Music Hall of Fame Announces Inductees for 2002|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-latin-music-hall-of-fame-announces-inductees-for-2002-76803217.html|accessdate=October 31, 2015|date=April 5, 2002}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Santana.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Santana 2003 at a concert in Barcelona.]]\nIn early August 2003, Santana was named fifteenth on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".

In 1988 [[PRS Guitars]] began making Santana signature model guitars, which Santana has played through its various iterations ever since (see below).\n\nSantana currently uses a Santana II model guitar fitted with PRS Santana III nickel covered pickups, a tremolo bar, and .009-.042 gauge [[D'Addario (manufacturer)|D'Addario]] strings. He also plays a PRS Santana MD \"The Multidimensional\" guitar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://santana.com/musicianscorner/guitars/blue.html |title=Santana \u2013 Musician's Corner \u2013 Blue Guitar |publisher=Santana.com |accessdate=March 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506061638/http://santana.com/musicianscorner/guitars/blue.html |archivedate=May 6, 2009 }}</ref>\nThe Santana guitars feature necks made of a single piece of mahogany topped with rosewood fretboards (some feature highly sought-after Brazilian [[rosewood]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://santana.com/musicianscorner/guitars/red.html |title=Santana \u2013 Musician's Corner \u2013 Red Guitar |publisher=Santana.com |accessdate=March 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401154851/http://www.santana.com/musicianscorner/guitars/red.html |archivedate=April 1, 2009  }}</ref>).

In the song \"Stand Up\" from the album ''[[Marathon (Santana album)|Marathon]]'' (1979), Santana uses a Heil [[talk box]] in the guitar solo. He has also used the Audiotech Guitar Products 1x6 Rack Mount Audio Switcher in rehearsals for the 2008 \"Live Your Light\" tour.\n\nSantana uses two different guitar picks: the large triangular Dunlop he has used for so many years, and the [[V-Picks Guitar Picks|V-Pick]] Freakishly Large Round.\n\n=== Amplifiers ===\nCarlos Santana's distinctive guitar tone is produced by PRS Santana signature guitars plugged into multiple amplifiers. The amps consist of a [[Mesa Boogie]] Mark I, Dumble [[Distortion (music)|Overdrive]] Reverb and more recently a Bludotone amplifier. Santana compares the tonal qualities of each amplifier to that of a singer producing head/nasal tones, chest tones, and belly tones. A three-way amp switcher is employed on Carlos's pedal board to enable him to switch between amps. Often the unique tones of each amplifier are blended together, complementing each other producing a richer tone.\n\nHe also put the \"Boogie\" in Mesa Boogie. Santana is credited with coining the popular Mesa amplifier name when he tried one and exclaimed, \"That little thing really Boogies!\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mesa Boogie Story \u2013 a history|publisher= Mesaboogie.com|url= http://www.mesaboogie.com/US/Smith/our_story.html|accessdate= June 14, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140220030205/http://www.mesaboogie.com/US/Smith/our_story.html|archivedate= February 20, 2014|df= mdy}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, Santana combines a Mesa/Boogie Mark I head running through a Boogie cabinet with [[Altec Lansing|Altec]] 417-8H (or recently [[JBL (company)|JBL]] E120s) speakers, and a [[Dumble Amplifiers|Dumble]] Overdrive Reverb and/or a Dumble Overdrive Special running through a Brown or [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] 4x12 cabinet with [[Celestion]] G12M \"Greenback\" speakers, depending on the desired sound. [[Shure]] KSM-32 microphones are used to pick up the sound, going to the [[Public address|PA]]. Additionally, a [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] Cyber-Twin Amp is mostly used at home.\n\nDuring his early career Santana used a GMT transistor amplifier stack and a silverface [[Fender Twin]]. The GMT 226A rig was used at the Woodstock concert as well as during recording Santana's debut album. During this era Santana had also begun to use the Fender Twin, which was also used on the debut and proceedingly{{clarify|date=February 2018}} at the recording sessions of Abraxas.\n\n==Personal life==\n{{multiple image|align = right|direction = horizontal|image1 = 21 Leaders 2012 Honoree Deborah Santana.jpg|width1 = 150|caption1 = Santana's first wife, Deborah King, in 2012|image2 = Cindy Blackman .jpg|width2 = 150|caption2 = Santana's second wife, Cindy Blackman, in 2008}}\nSantana became a [[naturalized U.S. citizen]] in 1965.<ref name=\"natural\">{{cite web |url=http://learn.pacificcoastimmigration.org/notable/profiles/csantana.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318103245/http://learn.pacificcoastimmigration.org/notable/profiles/csantana.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 18, 2011 |title=Welcome to the Pacific Coast Immigration Museum |publisher=learn.pacificcoastimmigration.org |accessdate=October 19, 2010  }}</ref>\n\nSantana married Deborah King in 1973.
