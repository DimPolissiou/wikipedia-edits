It generated four singles that charted in various parts of the world; the first, \"[[Hole in the Head]]\", became the group's third UK number one single. The three members of the Sugababes each recorded a \"solo\" song on the album&mdash;\"Whatever Makes You Happy\" ([[Keisha Buchanan]]), \"Sometimes\" ([[Heidi Range]]) and \"Maya\" ([[Mutya Buena]]). ''Three'' debuted at number three on the [[UK Albums Chart]].\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r807727|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic review]</ref>\n|rev2 = [[BBC]]\n|rev2score = (positive)<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/pg63/ BBC review]</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n|rev3score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/oct/24/popandrock.shopping10 The Guardian review]</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev4score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/sugababes/albums/album/5280216/review/6185256/three Rolling Stone review]</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]''\n|rev5Score = B+<ref>[http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/sugababes/three.html Stylus review]</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Yahoo!

They went over to America to work with bigger producers such as [[Linda Perry]] and [[Diane Warren]], who wrote the ballad \"[[Too Lost in You]]\". They had also aimed to release the new album in America. The girls co-wrote and recorded their own tracks on the new album\u2014Keisha's being \"Whatever Makes You Happy\", Heidi's being \"Sometimes\", and Mutya's being \"Maya\", a song about her sister who died unexpectedly. The Sugababes later announced the lead single \"[[Hole in the Head]]\" and its release date of 13 October. The UK release was a special edition with two extra tracks, \"Twisted\" and \"Buster\". Initially, the digital download version offered by Woolworths in the UK accidentally contained an earlier demo version of \"Whatever Makes You Happy\" but the mistake was quickly rectified.\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Three'' debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart with 52,905 copies sold in its first week. The first single, \"[[Hole in the Head]]\", was the group's third number-one single in the United Kingdom and also went to number one in [[Denmark]]. It reached number two in Ireland and [[Norway]], and the top forty in Australia. The second single, \"[[Too Lost in You]]\", reached the top ten in the UK and Norway, and the top forty in Australia. The third single, \"[[In the Middle (Sugababes song)|In the Middle]]\", went top ten in the UK, top twenty in Ireland and top forty in Europe and Australia. A fourth single, \"[[Caught in a Moment]]\", also reached the top ten in the UK.\n\nIn 2004, \"Hole in the Head\" was serviced to radio in the United States and became a top forty hit on [[pop radio]]. Following the moderate success of the single, ''Three'' was due for release in the US with an altered track listing featuring singles from the group's previous album, ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces (Sugababes album)|Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (2002).<ref>http://www.discogs.com/Sugababes-Three/release/452999</ref> The release was subsequently cancelled when a second single, \"Too Lost in You\", failed to make any impact. In the UK, the album is certified two times [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]].<ref name=\"United KingdomSugababesThreealbumCertRef\"/> The album also received a [[Platinum Europe Award]] by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] in recognition of European sales in excess of 1 million copies.{{certification Cite Ref|region=Europe|type=album|title=Three|artist=Sugababes|certyear=2004}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Three'' received positive reviews from critics, who praised the experimental new urban and hip hop sounds on the album. Alan Braidwood from the BBC gave ''Three'' a positive review, stating the album takes lead from ''Angels with Dirty Faces'' and calling it a fresh and exciting album. He also praised the new sound on the album. Ross Hoffman from AllMusic described the album as \"tuneful, R&B-inflected dance-pop with fresh-sounding but accessible productions, along with a healthy smattering of big droopy ballads with an expanded stylistic range\".\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| headline = ''Three'' {{nobold|\u2013 UK and Japan Special Edition}}<ref name=\"UK1\">{{cite web

Following the moderate success of the single, ''Three'' was due for release in the US with an altered track listing featuring singles from the group's previous album, ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces (Sugababes album)|Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (2002).<ref>http://www.discogs.com/Sugababes-Three/release/452999</ref> The release was subsequently cancelled when a second single, \"Too Lost in You\", failed to make any impact. In the UK, the album is certified two times [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]].<ref name=\"United KingdomSugababesThreealbumCertRef\"/> The album also received a [[Platinum Europe Award]] by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] in recognition of European sales in excess of 1 million copies.{{certification Cite Ref|region=Europe|type=album|title=Three|artist=Sugababes|certyear=2004}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Three'' received positive reviews from critics, who praised the experimental new urban and hip hop sounds on the album. Alan Braidwood from the BBC gave ''Three'' a positive review, stating the album takes lead from ''Angels with Dirty Faces'' and calling it a fresh and exciting album. He also praised the new sound on the album. Ross Hoffman from AllMusic described the album as \"tuneful, R&B-inflected dance-pop with fresh-sounding but accessible productions, along with a healthy smattering of big droopy ballads with an expanded stylistic range\".\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| headline = ''Three'' {{nobold|\u2013 UK and Japan Special Edition}}<ref name=\"UK\">{{cite web |title=Sugababes Three, CD |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Three-Sugababes/dp/B0000DK4SF/ |website=Amazon (UK store) |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n| total_length =\n\n| title1 = [[Hole in the Head]]\n| writer1 = {{Flatlist|\n* [[Brian Higgins (producer)|Brian Higgins]]\n* [[Heidi Range]]\n* [[Keisha Buchanan]]\n* [[Miranda Cooper]]\n* [[Mutya Buena]]\n* [[Niara Scarlett]]\n* Nick Coler\n* [[Tim Powell (producer)|Tim Powell]]\n}}\n| extra1 = {{Flatlist |\n* Higgins\n* [[Xenomania]]\n* Jeremy Wheatley\n* Yoad Nevo \n}}\n| length1 = 3:38\n\n| title2 = Whatever Makes You Happy\n| note2 = Keisha Buchanan solo\n| writer2 = {{Flatlist |\n* Craig Dodds\n* Gary Cooper\n* Buchanan\n* Pete Martin\n* Stuart Crichton\n}}\n| extra2 = {{flatlist |\n* Craigie\n* [[Guy Sigsworth]]\n* Crichton{{ref|b|[b]}}\n* Martin{{ref|b|[b]}}\n}}\n| length2 = 3:15\n\n| title3 = [[Caught in a Moment]]\n| writer3 = {{Flatlist |\n* Jony Lipsey\n* [[Karen Poole]]\n* [[Marius de Vries]]\n* Buchanan\n* Buena\n* Range\n}}\n| extra3 = Jony Rockstar\n| length3 = 4:24\n\n| title4 = Situation's Heavy\n| writer4 = {{Flatlist |\n* Buchanan\n* Buena\n* Range\n* Tim Larcombe\n* Shawn Lee\n* Higgins\n* Cooper\n* [[Edele Lynch]]\n}}\n| extra4 = {{Flatlist |\n* Higgins\n* Xenomania\n}}\n| length4 = 4:10\n\n| title5 = Million Different Ways\n| writer5 = {{Flatlist |\n* Craigie\n* Crichton\n* Felix Howard\n* [[Guy Sigsworth]]\n* Buchanan\n* Buena\n* Range\n}}\n| extra5 = {{Flatlist |\n* Craigie\n* Sigsworth\n* Crichton{{ref|b|[b]}}\n}}\n| length5 = 4:29\n\n| title6 = Twisted\n| note6 = UK bonus track\n| writer6 = {{Flatlist |\n* Buchanan\n* Buena\n* Range\n* Cooper\n* Higgins\n* Lee\n* Larcombe\n* Lynch\n}}\n| extra6 = Xenomania\n| length6 = 3:03\n\n| title7 = We Could Have It All\n| writer7 = {{Flatlist |\n* Craigie\n* Howard\n* Johnny Dollar\n* Buchanan\n* Buena\n* Range\n}}\n| extra7 = {{Flatlist |\n* Craigie\n* Sigsworth \n}}\n| length7 = 3:37\n\n| title8 = Conversation's Over\n| writer8 = {{Flatlist |\n* Tom Elmhirst\n* Lipsey\n* Poole\n* Buchanan\n* Buena\n* Range\n}}\n| extra8 = Rockstar\n| length8 = 4:06\n\n| title9 = [[In the Middle (Sugababes song)|In the Middle]]\n| writer9 = {{Flatlist |\n* Cooper\n* Higgins\n* Scarlett\n* Lee\n* Lisa Cowling\n* Buchanan\n* Buena\n* Range\n* Andre Tegler\n* Phil Fuldner\n* Michael Bellina\n}}\n| extra9 = {{Flatlist |\n* Higgins\n* Xenomania\n* Wheatley\n* [[Moguai]]{{ref|a|[a]}}\n* Fuldner{{ref|a|[a]}}\n* Bellina{{ref|a|[a]}}\n}}\n| length9 = 3:59\n\n| title10 = [[Too Lost in You]]\n| writer10 = [[Diane Warren]] And [[Jean Jacques Goldman]] \n| extra10 = {{Flatlist |\n* Andy Bradfield\n* Rob Dougan\n* Nevo{{ref|a|[a]}}\n}}\n| length10 = 3:58\n\n| title11 = Nasty Ghetto\n| writer11 = {{Flatlist |\n* [[Linda Perry]]\n* Buchanan\n* Buena\n* Range\n}}\n| extra11 = {{Flatlist |\n* Perry\n* Wheatley{{ref|a|[a]}}\n}}\n| length11 = 4:16\n\n| title12 = Buster\n| writer12 = {{Flatlist |\n* Buchanan\n* Buena\n* Range\n* Cooper\n* Higgins\n* Lee\n* Larcombe\n* Lynch\n}}\n| extra12 = Xenomania\n| length12 = 4:22\n\n| title13 = Sometimes\n| note13 = Heidi Range solo\n| writer13 = {{Flatlist |\n* Howard\n* Range\n* Lipsey\n* Buchanan\n* de Vries\n* Buena\n}}\n| extra13 = Rockstar\n| length13 = 4:34\n\n| title14 = Maya\n| note14 = Mutya Buena solo\n| writer14 = {{Flatlist |\n* Craigie\n* Sigsworth\n* Buena\n* Range\n* Buchanan\n}}\n| extra14 = {{Flatlist |\n* Sigsworth\n* Craigie\n}}\n| length14 = 4:43\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = ''Three'' {{nobold|\u2013 Australian and European edition}}<ref name=\"Australian\">{{cite web |title=Sugababes Three, CD |url=https://www.amazon.com.au/THREE-SUGABABES/dp/B0000TWLYE/ |website=Amazon (Australian store) |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Discogs Europe\">{{cite web |title=Sugababes -

Originally available on [[Compact Cassette (data)|Compact Cassette]] for the Apple I in 1976, then included in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] on the Apple II from its release in 1977, it was the first version of BASIC used by many early [[home computer]] owners.{{sfn|Weyhrich|2001}}\n\nThe language supported mathematics using [[integers]], lacking [[floating point|floating-point]] support. Using integers allowed numbers to be stored in a much more compact 16-bit format that could be more rapidly read and processed than the 32- or 40-bit floating-point formats found in most BASICs of the era. However, this limited its applicability as a general-purpose language.{{efn|Or as [[Bill Gates]] put it, \"more powerful BASIC... using floating point\".<ref>{{cite magazine\n|first1=Tom |last1=Rugg |first2=Phil |last2=Feldman\n|title=BASIC timing comparisons\u2026 revised and updated\n|magazine=Kilobaud\n|date=October 1977\n|pages=20\u201325\n|url=https://archive.org/details/kilobaudmagazine-1977-10\n}}</ref>}}\n\nAnother difference with other BASICs of the era is that Integer BASIC treated strings as arrays of characters, similar to the system in [[C programming language|C]] or [[Fortran 77]]. Substrings were accessed using [[array slicing]] rather than string functions. This style was introduced in [[HP Time-Shared BASIC]], and could also be found in other contemporary BASICs patterned on HP, like [[North Star BASIC]] and [[Atari BASIC]]. It contrasted with the style found in BASICs derived from [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], including [[Microsoft BASIC]].\n\nThe language was initially developed under the name '''GAME BASIC''' and referred to simply as '''Apple BASIC''' when it was introduced on the Apple I. It became Integer BASIC when it was ported to the Apple II and shipped alongside [[Applesoft BASIC]], a port of [[Microsoft BASIC]] which included floating-point support. Integer BASIC was phased out in favor of Applesoft BASIC starting with the [[Apple II Plus]] in 1979.\n\n==History==\nAs a senior in [[high school]], [[Steve Wozniak]]'s electronics teacher arranged for the leading students in the class to have placements at local electronics companies. Wozniak was sent to [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] where he programmed in [[FORTRAN]] on an IBM machine. That same year, [[General Electric]] placed a terminal in the high school that was connected to one of their mainframes running their [[timesharing]] BASIC service, which they were heavily promoting at the time. After having three days of access, the students were asked to write letters on why the school should receive a terminal permanently, but their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nSome years later, Wozniak was working at [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) running simulations of chip designs and logic layout for calculators.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}} HP made major inroads in the [[minicomputer]] market with their [[HP 2100]] series machines running a custom timesharing version of BASIC. For approximately $100,000, one could build up a reasonably equipped machine that could support between 16 and 32 users running BASIC programs.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://hpmemoryproject.org/news/tenyears_comp/measure_page_00.htm |title= Passing the 10-year mark |magazine= MEASURE Magazine |date= October 1976 |publisher= Hewlett Packard}}</ref> While expensive, it was still a fraction of the cost of the [[mainframe]] machines{{efn|An IBM 370/155 cost over $2 million in 1970 ({{Inflation|US|2000000|1970|fmt=eq}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arnnet.com.au/slideshow/541873/pictures-mostly-cool-history-ibm-mainframe/ |title=The (mostly) cool history of the IBM mainframe |first=Michael |last=Cooney |website=ARN}}</ref>}} and, for heavy users, less than the timesharing services.{{efn|Tymshare charged about $10 per hour ({{Inflation|US|10|1970|fmt=eq}}) for accessing their systems,<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Online Information Services, 1963\u20131976 |first1= Charles |last1=Bourne |first2=Trudi Bellardo |last2=Hahn |page=387 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=LTTvmUU8rskC&pg=PA387|isbn= 9780262261753 |date= August 2003 }}</ref> while smaller services could be found for about $5.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=InfoWorld |date=27 April 1981 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DT4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7 |title=Back to BASIC |first=Tim |last=Barry |page=7}}</ref>}} HP followed this with the [[HP 9830]], a desktop-sized machine for $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000|1970|fmt=eq}}) that also ran BASIC, which Wozniak had access to.{{sfn|Williams|Moore|1984|p=A71}}\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |quote=I sniffed the wind and knew that the key to making my computer good (popular) was to include a high-level language and that it had to be BASIC. |author=Steve Wozniak{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}}}\n\nIn January 1975 the [[Altair 8800]] was announced and sparked off the [[microcomputer]] revolution. In March, Wozniak attended the first meeting of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] and began formulating the design of his own computer. One of the most important pieces of software for the Altair, and one of the most heavily [[Copyright infringement|pirated]], was [[Altair BASIC]] from the recently formed [[Microsoft]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Understanding Online Piracy |first= Nathan |last=Fisk |page=14 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |date= 2009 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZZJxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA14}}</ref> Wozniak concluded that his machine would have to have a BASIC of its own, which would, hopefully, be the first for the [[MOS Technology 6502]] processor. As the language needed 4&nbsp;kB RAM, he made that the minimum memory for the design.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nWozniak's references for BASIC were a copy of ''[[101 BASIC Computer Games]]'' and an HP BASIC manual.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}} Unknown to him at the time, HP's BASIC was significantly different than the [[BASIC-PLUS|DEC BASIC]] variety used in ''101 Games'', which was also the pattern for MS's BASIC for the Altair. Based on these sources, be began sketching out a [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] chart for the language. The design initially included floating-point support, but still hoping he might publish the first BASIC on the 6502 and become \"a star\", he decided to abandon floating-point and write a separate integer math system to save a few weeks programming time.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nWozniak would later describe his language as \"intended primarily for games and educational uses\".{{sfn|Wozniak|1977}}  Referring to it throughout development as \"GAME BASIC\", Wozniak wrote the code by hand, translating the [[assembler code]] instructions into their [[machine code]] equivalents and then uploading the result to his computer.{{sfn|Weyhrich|2001|loc=The [Integer] BASIC, which we shipped with the first Apple II's, was never assembled &mdash; ever. There was one handwritten copy, all handwritten, all hand-assembled.}} Without any training on how to write a computer language, he used his HP calculator experience to implement a [[stack machine]] to interpret expressions.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}} Once the basic routines were up and running, he worked on the other commands one-by-one in a modular fashion. With every visit to the Homebrew club, he would demonstrate a few more features that had been added in the last month.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |quote=It was the most satisfying day of my life... I demonstrated Breakout [at Homebrew]-totally written in BASIC... After designing hardware arcade games, I knew that being able to program them in BASIC was going to change the world. |author=Steve Wozniak{{sfn|Williams|Moore|1984|p=A71}}}}\n\nWhile he was building out his computer and BASIC, Wozniak was also working for [[Atari]] designing [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]. At some point, he decided to see whether one could write the game in BASIC. He added commands to read [[paddle controller]]s and over a series of quick edits had a version of the game up and running. To improve its playability, he added a speaker to make clicks when the ball hit things. While showing it to [[Steve Jobs]], Wozniak demonstrated that he could quickly change the colors that his game used, just by altering the [[source code]]. Wozniak later wrote that he had proved that \"software was much more flexible than hardware\", and that he and Jobs realized that \"now, anyone could create arcade games without having to design it in hardware.\"{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nWozniak did complete a floating-point library for the 6502 and published it in the April 1976 edition of [[Dr. Dobbs]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_01/page/n207/mode/2up |first1=Roy |last1=Raskin |first2=Steven |last2=Wozniak |title=Floating Point Routines for the 6502 |magazine=Dr. Dobbs |date=August 1976 |pages=17\u201319}}</ref> This library was later made part of the ROMs for the [[Apple II]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Apple II Reference Manual |date= January 1978 |publisher=Apple Computer |pages=94-95}}</ref> Wozniak began work on back-porting the floating-point code into Apple BASIC, but got sidetracked in the task of designing a [[floppy disk]] controller for what became the [[Disk II]]. [[Mike Markkula]] said the company would go to the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas]] if the disk system was ready in time, so Wozniak and [[Randy Wigginton]] worked on it non-stop through the 1977 holidays.{{sfn|Wozniak|2018}}\n\nWhen he returned to the topic of floating-point in BASIC, Jobs complained it was taking too long. Without Wozniak being aware, the company arranged a license with Microsoft to receive their recently completed 6502 version of the Altair code. Examining the code, Wozniak decided that it was easier to add graphics support to MS's code than add floating-point his own BASIC, as the later required hand-patching of the original machine code while MS's was written in assembler and more easily modified. The development of Apple's BASIC ended in favor of what became Applesoft. Wozniak later noted, \"My biggest disappointment was going to the awful string functions like LEFT$(VAR, 5) and MID$(VAR2,5,3) instead of my own\".{{sfn|Wozniak|2018}}{{efn|The string handling was not \"his own\", but the same system used by HP BASIC.}}\n\nWhen the Apple II shipped in the summer of 1977, Integer BASIC was supplied in ROM, while Applesoft BASIC shipped on cassette. This changed with the introduction of the [[Apple II Plus]] in 1979, when Applesoft was put in the ROM.{{sfn|Hertzfeld|1985}}\n\n==Description==\n===Program editing===\nLike most BASIC implementations of the era, Integer BASIC was both the language interpreter as well as the line editing environment. When BASIC was running, a {{code|>}} [[command prompt]] was displayed where the user could enter statements.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=11}}{{efn|To make it clear which BASIC was running, Applesoft used the {{code|]}} prompt.}} Unlike later [[home computer]] platforms, BASIC was not the default environment when the computer started, it normally started in the [[machine code monitor|monitor]]. BASIC was started by pressing {{key press|Ctrl|B}}{{key press|Return}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=12}}\n\nStatements that were entered with leading numbers are entered into the program storage for \"deferred execution\",{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=46}} either as new lines or replacing any that might have had the same number previously.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|pp=49-55}} Statements that were entered without a line number were referred to as commands, and ran immediately.{{efn|In what MS referred to more descriptively as \"[[Direct mode|immediate mode]]\".}} Line numbers could be from 0 to 32767,{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=48}}{{efn|Helmers says the lowest line number is 1.{{sfn|Helmers|1978|p=24}}}} and lines could contain up to 128 characters.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=118}}\n\nInteger BASIC also included the {{code|AUTO}} command to automatically enter line numbers at a given starting number like {{code|AUTO 100}}, adding 10 to the last number with every new line. {{code|AUTO 300,5}} would begin numbering at line 300 by fives; 300, 305, etc. Automatic numbering was turned off by entering {{code|MAN}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|pp=65-67}}\n\nOne interesting feature of the editor was that a section of the screen could be set aside as the \"window\", where live updates took place. This was normally the entire screen, but it could be limited to a smaller area by {{code|POKE}}ing values into memory locations 32 through 35.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=124}} This feature could be used to create an editable text area while the rest of the screen was in graphics mode.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|loc=\"This mixed mode provides a 40 by 40 color graphics grid plus four lines of scrolling text at the bottom of the screen.\"}}\n\n===Debugging===\nAs in most BASICs, programs were started with the {{code|RUN}} command, and as was common, could be directed at a particular line number like {{code|RUN 300}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=100}} Execution could be stopped at any time using {{key press|Ctrl|C}}{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=15}} and then restarted with {{code|CON}}tinue, as opposed to the more typical {{code|CONT}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=52}}\n\nFor step-by-step execution, the {{code|TRACE}} instruction could be used at the command prompt or placed within the program itself. When it was turned on, line numbers were printed out for each line the program visited. The feature could be turned off again with {{code|NOTRACE}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=107}}\n\nA somewhat unusual feature was the {{code|DSP}} (for \"display\") command. When encountered in a program, from that point on any ''changes'' to a variable's value would be displayed. For instance, {{code|DSP X}} would display the value of X every time it changed, along with the line number where the change occurred.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|pp=100,101}} As with TRACE, DSP was turned off with {{code|NODSP}}.{{sfn|Helmers|1978|p=24}}\n\n===Mathematics===\nInteger BASIC, as its name implies, uses integers as the basis for its math package. These were stored internally as a 16-bit number, little-endian (as is the 6502). This allowed a maximum value for any calculation between -32767 and 32767; although the format could also store the value -32768, BASIC could not display that number. Calculations that resulted in values outside that range produced a {{code|>32767 ERR}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=27}}\n\nInfix operators included {{code|+}} (addition), {{code|-}} (subraction), {{code|*}} (multiplication), {{code|/}} (division), [[Modulo operation|MOD]] (remainder) and exponent using the {{code|^}} character. Binary operators included {{code|AND}}, {{code|OR}} and {{code|NOT}}. Binary comparisons included the standard set of {{code|{{=}}}}, {{code|>}}, {{code|<}}, {{code|>{{=}}}}, {{code|<{{=}}}}, {{code|<>}} and the HP-inspired {{code|#}}, which was equivalent to <>.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=61}}\n\nOnly single-dimension arrays were allowed, limited in size only by the available memory.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=94}} Mathematical functions were sparse; only {{code|ABS}} (absolute value), {{code|SGN}} (sign) and {{code|RND}} (random number) were supported.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=40,120}} In contrast to MS-derived versions, where the parameter was ignored and {{code|RND}} always returned a value 0..<1, Integer BASIC used the parameter; {{code|RND(6)}} returned an integer from 0 to 5.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=40}}\n\n===Strings===\nInteger BASIC's string handling was based on the system in HP BASIC. This treated string variables as arrays of characters, which had to be {{code|DIM}}ed prior to use. This is similar to the model in [[C programming language|C]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.learn-c.org/en/Strings |title= Strings |website=learn-c.org}}</ref> or [[Fortran 77]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Brooks |url=http://math.hawaii.edu/~dale/190/characters_formats.pdf |website=University of Hawaii |title=Characters & Strings in Fortran}}</ref> This is in contrast to MS-like BASICs, where strings are an intrinsic variable-length type.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2020/commodore-basic-variables |title=C64 Programmer's Manual |publisher=Commodore |chapter=\nInteger, Floating Point and String Variables}}</ref> Before MS-derived BASICs became the ''de facto'' standard, this style was not uncommon; [[North Star BASIC]]<ref>{{cite book |title=North Star BASIC version 6 |url=http://itelsoft.com.au/north_star_manuals/North_Star_BASIC_Version_6.pdf |publisher=North Star Corporation |date=1977}}</ref> and [[Atari BASIC]]<ref>{{{cite book |title=The ATARI BASIC Reference Manual |publisher=Atari Inc |year=1980 |url=http://www.strotmann.de/twiki/bin/view/Infothek/AtBasicReferenceMa}}</ref> used the same concept, as did others.\n \nStrings in Integer used a fixed amount of memory, regardless of the number of characters used within them to a maximum of 255 characters.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=89}} This had the advantage of avoiding the need for the [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] of the [[Heap (data structure)|heap]] that was notoriously slow in MS BASIC{{efn|And completely broken in some versions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pagetable.com/?p=46 |title=Create your own Version of Microsoft BASIC}}</ref>}} but meant that strings that were shorter than the declared length was wasted.\n\nSubstring access was provided through [[array slicing]] syntax. For instance, {{code|PRINT A$(0,5)}} prints the first six characters of A$, characters 0 through 5.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=88}}{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=88}}{{efn|HP also allowed [ and ] in place of ( and ).}} Concatenation was provided using the same system, {{code|A$(5){{=}}\"ABC\"}} replaced any characters starting at position 5 with the string \"ABC\".{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=92}} This contrasts with the DEC/MS-style string handling, which uses string functions like {{code|MID$}} to access substrings, and {{code|+}} for concatenation.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://chiclassiccomp.org/docs/content/computing/MITS/MITS_Altair8800Basic4.1Reference_April1977.pdf |title=altair 8080 basic manual |date=April 1977 |publisher=MITS |page=30}}</ref>{{efn|It also contrasts with [[Dartmouth BASIC]], which used the {{code|CONVERT}} command to convert a string into an array of ASCII values, which the user then manipulated and converted back to string format with a second {{code|CONVERT}}.}}\n\nAs many of the features that would be provided by string functions were instead provided by array slicing, the selection of string functions was reduced. {{code|LEN$}} returned the length of a string,{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=89}} and {{code|ASC}} returned the ASCII numeric code for the first letter in a string.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}} It lacked an equivalent of the {{code|CHR$}} that returned the ASCII character with a given numeric code.{{sfn|Mini|1977|p=17}}\n\n===Graphics and sound===\nWhen launched, the only [[game controller]] for the Apple was the [[paddle controller]], which had two controllers on a single connector. The position of the controller could be read using the {{code|PDL}} function, passing in the controller number, 0 or 1, like {{code|A{{=}}PDL(0):PRINT A}}, returning a value between 0 and 255.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=36}}{{efn|The manual suggests, but does not outright state, that the actual range of values is less than 0 to 255.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=36}}}}\n\nThe Apple machines did not include dedicated sound hardware, only a simple \"beeper\". Producing sounds was accomplished by {{code|PEEK}}ing the memory-mapped location of the speaker, -16336.{{efn|The negative number is a side-effect of the integers being stored in signed format, so any memory location over 32767 appeared as a negative value in BASIC.{{sfn|Mini|1977|p=18}}}} Repeatedly PEEKing that value produced tones, and the manual suggested using a mathematical expression to do this, like {{code|S{{=}}PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=84}}\n\nSupport for graphics was more detailed. Graphics mode was turned on with the {{code|GR}} statement and off with {{code|TEXT}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=31}} Drawing was modal and normally started by issuing a command to change the color, which was accomplished by setting a pseudo-variable; {{code|COLOR{{=}}12}} would set the drawing color to 12, light green. One could then {{code|PLOT 10,10}} to produce a single spot of that color,{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=32}} {{code|HLIN 0,39 AT 20}} to draw a horizontal line at row 20 that spanned the screen, or {{code|VLIN 5,15 AT 7}} to draw a shorter vertical line down column 7.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=33}} {{code|A{{=}}SCRN X,Y}} returned the color of the screen at X,Y.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}}{{efn|Note the odd syntax of the SCRN, which is technically a function because it returns a value, but does not use function-like syntax which would be {{code|A{{=}}SCRN(X,Y)}}.}}\n\n===Input/Output===\nInteger BASIC lacked any custom input/output commands, and also lacked the {{code|DATA}} statement and the associated {{code|READ}}. To get data into and out of a program, the input/output functionality was redirected to a selected [[Expansion card|card slot]] with the {{code|PR#x}} and {{code|IN#x}}, which redirected output or input (respectively) to the numbered slot. From then on, data could be sent to the card using conventional {{code|PRINT}} commands and read from it using {{code|INPUT}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}}\n\n===Other notes===\nInteger BASIC included a {{code|TAB}} feature, which positioned the cursor on a given column from 0 to 39. It differed from the versions found in most BASICs in that it was a command with a following number, as opposed to a function with the value in parenthesis; one would move the cursor to column 10 using {{code|TAB 10}} in Integer BASIC{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=73}} whereas in MS this would be {{code|PRINT TAB(10)}}. Additionally, the {{code|VTAB}} command worked similar to {{code|TAB}} but added vertical spaces instead of horizontal. For unexplained reasons, in this case the coordinates were from 1 to 24 rather than 0 to 23.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=74}}\n\nInteger BASIC included a {{code|POP}} command to exit from loops.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}} This popped the topmost item off the FOR stack. Atari BASIC also supported the same command,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.atarimania.com/documents/Atari-Basic-Reference-Manual-Rev-C.pdf |title=Atari BASIC Reference Manual |publisher=Atari |date=1983 |page=25}}</ref> while [[North Star BASIC]] used {{code|EXIT}}.<ref>{{cite book |title=North Star BASIC version 6 |url=http://itelsoft.com.au/north_star_manuals/North_Star_BASIC_Version_6.pdf |publisher=North Star Corporation |date=1977 |page=8}}</ref>\n\nThe Integer BASIC ROMs also included a [[machine code monitor]], \"mini-[[assembler (computing)|assembler]]\", and disassembler to create and debug [[assembly language]] programs. Wozniak hand-assembled the monitor as the Apple II's first program, then used it to write Integer BASIC.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}{{sfn|Helmers|1978|p=18}}{{sfn|Weyhrich|2001}}\n\n==Implementation==\n===Tokenizer===\nInteger BASIC read the lines typed in by the user from a buffer and ran them through a [[Parsing|parser]] which output a series of [[Lexical token|tokens]]. As part of this process, simple [[syntax error]]s are detected and listed. If the parsing is successful, the line number (if present) is converted from [[ASCII]] decimal format into a 16-bit integer, and any keywords into a 7-bit integer token.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}\n\nNumeric literals, like the value 500, were converted into their 16-bit (two-byte) binary representation, in this case, $01F4 [[hexidecimal]]. To indicate this was a value and not a keyword, a single byte between $B0 and $B9 was inserted in front of the two-byte value.{{efn|The first digit of the original value is used to select a value from 0 to 9, so in this example, the token would be $B5 for the first digit of 500.}} String literals, like \"HELLO WORLD\" were instead converted by setting the high bit of each character, so that {{code|A}} was stored as $C1. Variable names were converted in the same fashion, with the letters converted to have their high-bit turned on, and any digits in the name represented by the corresponding $B0 through $B9, so that the variable {{code|A5}} would be tokenized as $C1B5.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}\n\nIf the line was entered without a line number, the code was then executed directly from the buffer. If it had a line number, it was copied from the buffer into the program storage area.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}} The line in the buffer was first prefixed with a single byte containing the line length and postfixed with a $01 to indicate the end of the line (null was not used).{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe runtime interpreter used two stacks for execution, one for statement keywords and the other for evaluating the parameters. Each statement was given two priorities, one that stated where it should occur in a multi-step operation, like a string of mathematical operations to provide [[order of operations]], and another that suggested when evaluation should occur, for instance, calculating internal values of a parenthesis formula. When variables are encountered, their name is parsed and then looked up in the variable storage area. The address of the variable's storage, perhaps freshly created, is then placed on the evaluation stack.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}\n\n===SWEET16===\n{{main|SWEET16}}\nInteger BASIC is partially implemented in a custom [[assembler language]] known as [[SWEET16]]. SWEET16 is based on [[bytecode]]s that run within a simple 16-bit [[virtual machine]]. This model was used so memory could be addressed via indirect 16-bit pointers and 16-bit math functions calculated without the need to translate those to the underlying multi-instruction 8-bit 6502 code. The entire virtual machine was written in only 300 bytes. Code can call SWEET16 by issuing a [[subroutine]] call, and then return to normal 6502 code when the 16-bit operations are complete.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=43}}\n\n==Performance==\nBecause Integer BASIC processed more of the original [[source code]] into tokens, the runtime was faster than versions that required additional runtime parsing. For comparison, [[Tiny BASIC]] tokenized only the line number,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Build Your Own BASIC |first=Dennis |last=Allison |magazine=Dr. Dobb's Journal |volume=1 |number=1 |date=1976 |url=https://archive.org/details/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_01/page/n11 |page=11}}</ref> while MS BASICs tokenized only the keywords. So for instance, while Integer BASIC would convert the line {{code|100 GOTO 200}} entirely into tokens that could be immediately read and performed, in MS BASIC only the line number and GOTO would be tokenized, the \"100\" was left in its original format and had to be re-parsed every time.<ref name=altair>{{cite web |url=http://www.rjh.org.uk/altair/4k/int_dis_11.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011105014524/http://www.rjh.org.uk/altair/4k/int_dis_11.htm |archive-date=19 November 2001 |title=Altair BASIC 3.2 (4K) - Annotated Disassembly |first=Roger |last=Hardiman |page=1.11}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, working solely with integer math provides another major boost in speed. This is due both to the smaller 16-bit format requiring fewer memory accesses, as well as removing the need to move the floating-point decimal after calculations. As many [[computer benchmark]]s of the era were small and often performed simple math that did not require floating-point, Integer BASIC trounced most other BASICs.{{efn|[[Bill Gates]] complained about this, stating that it was unfair to compare Integer BASIC to a \"real\" BASIC like MS.<ref name=rugg2>{{cite magazine |first1=Tom |last1=Rugg |first2=Phil |last2=Feldman |title=BASIC timing comparisons\u2026 revised and updated |magazine=Kilobaud |date=October 1977 |pages=20\u201325 |url=https://archive.org/details/kilobaudmagazine-1977-10}}</ref>}}\n\nOn one of the earliest known microcomputer benchmarks, the [[Rugg/Feldman benchmarks]], Integer BASIC was well over twice as fast as Applesoft BASIC on the same machine.<ref name=rugg>{{cite magazine |first1=Tom |last1=Rugg |first2=Phil |last2=Feldman |title=BASIC Timing Comparisons\u2026 information for speed freaks |magazine=Kilobaud |date=June 1977 |pages=66\u201370 |url=https://archive.org/details/kilobaudmagazine-1977-06}}</ref> In the [[Byte Sieve]], where math was less important but array access and looping performance dominated, Integer BASIC took 166 seconds while Applesoft took 200.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=A High-Level Language Benchmark |first=Jim |last=Gilbreath |magazine=Byte |date=September 1981 |url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-09/page/n181 |page=192}}</ref> It did not appear in the [[Creative Computing Benchmark]], which was first published in 1983, by which time Integer BASIC was no longer supplied by default.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Creative Computing |date=November 1983 |first=David |last=Ahl |title=Benchmark Comparison Test |url=https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1983-11/page/n271/mode/2up |page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe following test series, taken from both of the original Rugg/Feldman articles,<ref name=rugg/><ref name=rugg2/> indicates several interesting points. Test 1 was simply a {{code|FOR...NEXT}} loop from 1 to 1000. In this test, Applesoft turns in a time identical to Integer. Both BASICs cache the location of the {{code|FOR}} so it can quickly return to that line when it reaches the {{code|NEXT}}. No math or line-lookups are performed, so the two are similar in speed. Test 2 is another loop from 1 to 1000, but differs in that it uses a {{code|IF...THEN}} with an implicit GOTO to perform the loop instead of a FOR/NEXT. In this case, Integer is almost three times as fast as Applesoft, which illustrates the gains of having pre-parsed the target line number. Test 3 adds simple arithmetic calculations to Test 2, taking an additional 4.1 seconds in Integer and 7.5 in MS. Test 4 replaces variables with numeric constants, this does not change the time needed for Integer as the constants are already parsed to 16-bit values, whereas it takes MS another 1.8 seconds as it repeatedly re-parses the numbers from ASCII to the 40-bit internal format. The remaining tests add {{code|GOSUB}} and array access, the former benefiting as in the case of THEN/GOTO, the later by performing the index lookup in the array using a 16-bit variable value rather than having to convert it from 40-bit floating-point variable.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Originally available on [[Compact Cassette (data)|Compact Cassette]] for the Apple I in 1976, then included in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] on the Apple II from its release in 1977, it was the first version of BASIC used by many early [[home computer]] owners.{{sfn|Weyhrich|2001}}\n\nThe language supported mathematics using [[integers]], lacking [[floating point|floating-point]] support. Using integers allowed numbers to be stored in a much more compact 16-bit format that could be more rapidly read and processed than the 32- or 40-bit floating-point formats found in most BASICs of the era. However, this limited its applicability as a general-purpose language.{{efn|Or as [[Bill Gates]] put it, \"more powerful BASIC... using floating point\".<ref>{{cite magazine\n|first1=Tom |last1=Rugg |first2=Phil |last2=Feldman\n|title=BASIC timing comparisons\u2026 revised and updated\n|magazine=Kilobaud\n|date=October 1977\n|pages=20\u201325\n|url=https://archive.org/details/kilobaudmagazine-1977-10\n}}</ref>}}\n\nAnother difference with other BASICs of the era is that Integer BASIC treated strings as arrays of characters, similar to the system in [[C programming language|C]] or [[Fortran 77]]. Substrings were accessed using [[array slicing]] rather than string functions. This style was introduced in [[HP Time-Shared BASIC]], and could also be found in other contemporary BASICs patterned on HP, like [[North Star BASIC]] and [[Atari BASIC]]. It contrasted with the style found in BASICs derived from [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], including [[Microsoft BASIC]].\n\nThe language was initially developed under the name '''GAME BASIC''' and referred to simply as '''Apple BASIC''' when it was introduced on the Apple I. It became Integer BASIC when it was ported to the Apple II and shipped alongside [[Applesoft BASIC]], a port of [[Microsoft BASIC]] which included floating-point support. Integer BASIC was phased out in favor of Applesoft BASIC starting with the [[Apple II Plus]] in 1979.\n\n==History==\nAs a senior in [[high school]], [[Steve Wozniak]]'s electronics teacher arranged for the leading students in the class to have placements at local electronics companies. Wozniak was sent to [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] where he programmed in [[FORTRAN]] on an IBM machine. That same year, [[General Electric]] placed a terminal in the high school that was connected to one of their mainframes running their [[timesharing]] BASIC service, which they were heavily promoting at the time. After having three days of access, the students were asked to write letters on why the school should receive a terminal permanently, but their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nSome years later, Wozniak was working at [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) running simulations of chip designs and logic layout for calculators.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}} HP made major inroads in the [[minicomputer]] market with their [[HP 2100]] series machines running a custom timesharing version of BASIC. For approximately $100,000, one could build up a reasonably equipped machine that could support between 16 and 32 users running BASIC programs.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://hpmemoryproject.org/news/tenyears_comp/measure_page_00.htm |title= Passing the 10-year mark |magazine= MEASURE Magazine |date= October 1976 |publisher= Hewlett Packard}}</ref> While expensive, it was still a fraction of the cost of the [[mainframe]] machines{{efn|An IBM 370/155 cost over $2 million in 1970 ({{Inflation|US|2000000|1970|fmt=eq}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arnnet.com.au/slideshow/541873/pictures-mostly-cool-history-ibm-mainframe/ |title=The (mostly) cool history of the IBM mainframe |first=Michael |last=Cooney |website=ARN}}</ref>}} and, for heavy users, less than the timesharing services.{{efn|Tymshare charged about $10 per hour ({{Inflation|US|10|1970|fmt=eq}}) for accessing their systems,<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Online Information Services, 1963\u20131976 |first1= Charles |last1=Bourne |first2=Trudi Bellardo |last2=Hahn |page=387 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=LTTvmUU8rskC&pg=PA387|isbn= 9780262261753 |date= August 2003 }}</ref> while smaller services could be found for about $5.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=InfoWorld |date=27 April 1981 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DT4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7 |title=Back to BASIC |first=Tim |last=Barry |page=7}}</ref>}} HP followed this with the [[HP 9830]], a desktop-sized machine for $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10000|1970|fmt=eq}}) that also ran BASIC, which Wozniak had access to.{{sfn|Williams|Moore|1984|p=A71}}\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |quote=I sniffed the wind and knew that the key to making my computer good (popular) was to include a high-level language and that it had to be BASIC. |author=Steve Wozniak{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}}}\n\nIn January 1975 the [[Altair 8800]] was announced and sparked off the [[microcomputer]] revolution. In March, Wozniak attended the first meeting of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] and began formulating the design of his own computer. One of the most important pieces of software for the Altair, and one of the most heavily [[Copyright infringement|pirated]], was [[Altair BASIC]] from the recently formed [[Microsoft]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Understanding Online Piracy |first= Nathan |last=Fisk |page=14 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |date= 2009 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZZJxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA14}}</ref> Wozniak concluded that his machine would have to have a BASIC of its own, which would, hopefully, be the first for the [[MOS Technology 6502]] processor. As the language needed 4&nbsp;kB RAM, he made that the minimum memory for the design.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nWozniak's references for BASIC were a copy of ''[[101 BASIC Computer Games]]'' and an HP BASIC manual.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}} Unknown to him at the time, HP's BASIC was significantly different than the [[BASIC-PLUS|DEC BASIC]] variety used in ''101 Games'', which was also the pattern for MS's BASIC for the Altair. Based on these sources, be began sketching out a [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] chart for the language. The design initially included floating-point support, but still hoping he might publish the first BASIC on the 6502 and become \"a star\", he decided to abandon floating-point and write a separate integer math system to save a few weeks programming time.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nWozniak would later describe his language as \"intended primarily for games and educational uses\".{{sfn|Wozniak|1977}}  Referring to it throughout development as \"GAME BASIC\", Wozniak wrote the code by hand, translating the [[assembler code]] instructions into their [[machine code]] equivalents and then uploading the result to his computer.{{sfn|Weyhrich|2001|loc=The [Integer] BASIC, which we shipped with the first Apple II's, was never assembled &mdash; ever. There was one handwritten copy, all handwritten, all hand-assembled.}} Without any training on how to write a computer language, he used his HP calculator experience to implement a [[stack machine]] to interpret expressions.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}} Once the basic routines were up and running, he worked on the other commands one-by-one in a modular fashion. With every visit to the Homebrew club, he would demonstrate a few more features that had been added in the last month.{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |quote=It was the most satisfying day of my life... I demonstrated Breakout [at Homebrew]-totally written in BASIC... After designing hardware arcade games, I knew that being able to program them in BASIC was going to change the world. |author=Steve Wozniak{{sfn|Williams|Moore|1984|p=A71}}}}\n\nAs he built out his computer and BASIC, Wozniak was also working for [[Atari]] designing [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]. At some point, he decided to see whether one could write the game in BASIC. He added commands to read [[paddle controller]]s and over a series of quick edits had a version of the game up and running. To improve its playability, he added a speaker to make clicks when the ball hit things. While showing it to [[Steve Jobs]], Wozniak demonstrated that he could quickly change the colors that his game used, just by altering the [[source code]]. Wozniak later wrote that he had proved that \"software was much more flexible than hardware\", and that he and Jobs realized that \"now, anyone could create arcade games without having to design it in hardware.\"{{sfn|Wozniak|2014}}\n\nWozniak did complete a floating-point library for the 6502 and published it in the April 1976 edition of [[Dr. Dobbs]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_01/page/n207/mode/2up |first1=Roy |last1=Raskin |first2=Steven |last2=Wozniak |title=Floating Point Routines for the 6502 |magazine=Dr. Dobbs |date=August 1976 |pages=17\u201319}}</ref> This library was later made part of the ROMs for the [[Apple II]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Apple II Reference Manual |date= January 1978 |publisher=Apple Computer |pages=94-95}}</ref> Wozniak began work on back-porting the floating-point code into Apple BASIC, but got sidetracked in the task of designing a [[floppy disk]] controller for what became the [[Disk II]]. [[Mike Markkula]] said the company would go to the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas]] if the disk system was ready in time, so Wozniak and [[Randy Wigginton]] worked on it non-stop through the 1977 holidays.{{sfn|Wozniak|2018}}\n\nWhen he returned to the topic of floating-point in BASIC, Jobs complained it was taking too long. Without Wozniak being aware, the company arranged a license with Microsoft to receive their recently completed 6502 version of the Altair code. Examining the code, Wozniak decided that it was easier to add graphics support to MS's code than add floating-point his own BASIC, as the later required hand-patching of the original machine code while MS's was written in assembler and more easily modified. The development of Apple's BASIC ended in favor of what became Applesoft. Wozniak later noted, \"My biggest disappointment was going to the awful string functions like LEFT$(VAR, 5) and MID$(VAR2,5,3) instead of my own\".{{sfn|Wozniak|2018}}{{efn|The string handling was not \"his own\", but the same system used by HP BASIC.}}\n\nWhen the Apple II shipped in the summer of 1977, Integer BASIC was supplied in ROM, while Applesoft BASIC shipped on cassette. This changed with the introduction of the [[Apple II Plus]] in 1979, when Applesoft was put in the ROM.{{sfn|Hertzfeld|1985}}\n\n==Description==\n===Program editing===\nLike most BASIC implementations of the era, Integer BASIC was both the language interpreter as well as the line editing environment. When BASIC was running, a {{code|>}} [[command prompt]] was displayed where the user could enter statements.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=11}}{{efn|To make it clear which BASIC was running, Applesoft used the {{code|]}} prompt.}} Unlike later [[home computer]] platforms, BASIC was not the default environment when the computer started, it normally started in the [[machine code monitor|monitor]]. BASIC was started by pressing {{key press|Ctrl|B}}{{key press|Return}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=12}}\n\nStatements that were entered with leading numbers are entered into the program storage for \"deferred execution\",{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=46}} either as new lines or replacing any that might have had the same number previously.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|pp=49-55}} Statements that were entered without a line number were referred to as commands, and ran immediately.{{efn|In what MS referred to more descriptively as \"[[Direct mode|immediate mode]]\".}} Line numbers could be from 0 to 32767,{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=48}}{{efn|Helmers says the lowest line number is 1.{{sfn|Helmers|1978|p=24}}}} and lines could contain up to 128 characters.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=118}}\n\nInteger BASIC also included the {{code|AUTO}} command to automatically enter line numbers at a given starting number like {{code|AUTO 100}}, adding 10 to the last number with every new line. {{code|AUTO 300,5}} would begin numbering at line 300 by fives; 300, 305, etc. Automatic numbering was turned off by entering {{code|MAN}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|pp=65-67}}\n\nOne interesting feature of the editor was that a section of the screen could be set aside as the \"window\", where live updates took place. This was normally the entire screen, but it could be limited to a smaller area by {{code|POKE}}ing values into memory locations 32 through 35.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=124}} This feature could be used to create an editable text area while the rest of the screen was in graphics mode.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|loc=\"This mixed mode provides a 40 by 40 color graphics grid plus four lines of scrolling text at the bottom of the screen.\"}}\n\n===Debugging===\nAs in most BASICs, programs were started with the {{code|RUN}} command, and as was common, could be directed at a particular line number like {{code|RUN 300}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=100}} Execution could be stopped at any time using {{key press|Ctrl|C}}{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=15}} and then restarted with {{code|CON}}tinue, as opposed to the more typical {{code|CONT}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=52}}\n\nFor step-by-step execution, the {{code|TRACE}} instruction could be used at the command prompt or placed within the program itself. When it was turned on, line numbers were printed out for each line the program visited. The feature could be turned off again with {{code|NOTRACE}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=107}}\n\nA somewhat unusual feature was the {{code|DSP}} (for \"display\") command. When encountered in a program, from that point on any ''changes'' to a variable's value would be displayed. For instance, {{code|DSP X}} would display the value of X every time it changed, along with the line number where the change occurred.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|pp=100,101}} As with TRACE, DSP was turned off with {{code|NODSP}}.{{sfn|Helmers|1978|p=24}}\n\n===Mathematics===\nInteger BASIC, as its name implies, uses integers as the basis for its math package. These were stored internally as a 16-bit number, little-endian (as is the 6502). This allowed a maximum value for any calculation between -32767 and 32767; although the format could also store the value -32768, BASIC could not display that number. Calculations that resulted in values outside that range produced a {{code|>32767 ERR}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=27}}\n\nInfix operators included {{code|+}} (addition), {{code|-}} (subraction), {{code|*}} (multiplication), {{code|/}} (division), [[Modulo operation|MOD]] (remainder) and exponent using the {{code|^}} character. Binary operators included {{code|AND}}, {{code|OR}} and {{code|NOT}}. Binary comparisons included the standard set of {{code|{{=}}}}, {{code|>}}, {{code|<}}, {{code|>{{=}}}}, {{code|<{{=}}}}, {{code|<>}} and the HP-inspired {{code|#}}, which was equivalent to <>.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=61}}\n\nOnly single-dimension arrays were allowed, limited in size only by the available memory.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=94}} Mathematical functions were sparse; only {{code|ABS}} (absolute value), {{code|SGN}} (sign) and {{code|RND}} (random number) were supported.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=40,120}} In contrast to MS-derived versions, where the parameter was ignored and {{code|RND}} always returned a value 0..<1, Integer BASIC used the parameter; {{code|RND(6)}} returned an integer from 0 to 5.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=40}}\n\n===Strings===\nInteger BASIC's string handling was based on the system in HP BASIC. This treated string variables as arrays of characters, which had to be {{code|DIM}}ed prior to use. This is similar to the model in [[C programming language|C]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.learn-c.org/en/Strings |title= Strings |website=learn-c.org}}</ref> or [[Fortran 77]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Brooks |url=http://math.hawaii.edu/~dale/190/characters_formats.pdf |website=University of Hawaii |title=Characters & Strings in Fortran}}</ref> This is in contrast to MS-like BASICs, where strings are an intrinsic variable-length type.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2020/commodore-basic-variables |title=C64 Programmer's Manual |publisher=Commodore |chapter=\nInteger, Floating Point and String Variables}}</ref> Before MS-derived BASICs became the ''de facto'' standard, this style was not uncommon; [[North Star BASIC]]<ref>{{cite book |title=North Star BASIC version 6 |url=http://itelsoft.com.au/north_star_manuals/North_Star_BASIC_Version_6.pdf |publisher=North Star Corporation |date=1977}}</ref> and [[Atari BASIC]]<ref>{{{cite book |title=The ATARI BASIC Reference Manual |publisher=Atari Inc |year=1980 |url=http://www.strotmann.de/twiki/bin/view/Infothek/AtBasicReferenceMa}}</ref> used the same concept, as did others.\n \nStrings in Integer used a fixed amount of memory, regardless of the number of characters used within them to a maximum of 255 characters.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=89}} This had the advantage of avoiding the need for the [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] of the [[Heap (data structure)|heap]] that was notoriously slow in MS BASIC{{efn|And completely broken in some versions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pagetable.com/?p=46 |title=Create your own Version of Microsoft BASIC}}</ref>}} but meant that strings that were shorter than the declared length was wasted.\n\nSubstring access was provided through [[array slicing]] syntax. For instance, {{code|PRINT A$(0,5)}} prints the first six characters of A$, characters 0 through 5.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=88}}{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=88}}{{efn|HP also allowed [ and ] in place of ( and ).}} Concatenation was provided using the same system, {{code|A$(5){{=}}\"ABC\"}} replaced any characters starting at position 5 with the string \"ABC\".{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=92}} This contrasts with the DEC/MS-style string handling, which uses string functions like {{code|MID$}} to access substrings, and {{code|+}} for concatenation.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://chiclassiccomp.org/docs/content/computing/MITS/MITS_Altair8800Basic4.1Reference_April1977.pdf |title=altair 8080 basic manual |date=April 1977 |publisher=MITS |page=30}}</ref>{{efn|It also contrasts with [[Dartmouth BASIC]], which used the {{code|CONVERT}} command to convert a string into an array of ASCII values, which the user then manipulated and converted back to string format with a second {{code|CONVERT}}.}}\n\nAs many of the features that would be provided by string functions were instead provided by array slicing, the selection of string functions was reduced. {{code|LEN$}} returned the length of a string,{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=89}} and {{code|ASC}} returned the ASCII numeric code for the first letter in a string.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}} It lacked an equivalent of the {{code|CHR$}} that returned the ASCII character with a given numeric code.{{sfn|Mini|1977|p=17}}\n\n===Graphics and sound===\nWhen launched, the only [[game controller]] for the Apple was the [[paddle controller]], which had two controllers on a single connector. The position of the controller could be read using the {{code|PDL}} function, passing in the controller number, 0 or 1, like {{code|A{{=}}PDL(0):PRINT A}}, returning a value between 0 and 255.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=36}}{{efn|The manual suggests, but does not outright state, that the actual range of values is less than 0 to 255.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=36}}}}\n\nThe Apple machines did not include dedicated sound hardware, only a simple \"beeper\". Producing sounds was accomplished by {{code|PEEK}}ing the memory-mapped location of the speaker, -16336.{{efn|The negative number is a side-effect of the integers being stored in signed format, so any memory location over 32767 appeared as a negative value in BASIC.{{sfn|Mini|1977|p=18}}}} Repeatedly PEEKing that value produced tones, and the manual suggested using a mathematical expression to do this, like {{code|S{{=}}PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)-PEEK(-16336)}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=84}}\n\nSupport for graphics was more detailed. Graphics mode was turned on with the {{code|GR}} statement and off with {{code|TEXT}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=31}} Drawing was modal and normally started by issuing a command to change the color, which was accomplished by setting a pseudo-variable; {{code|COLOR{{=}}12}} would set the drawing color to 12, light green. One could then {{code|PLOT 10,10}} to produce a single spot of that color,{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=32}} {{code|HLIN 0,39 AT 20}} to draw a horizontal line at row 20 that spanned the screen, or {{code|VLIN 5,15 AT 7}} to draw a shorter vertical line down column 7.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=33}} {{code|A{{=}}SCRN X,Y}} returned the color of the screen at X,Y.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}}{{efn|Note the odd syntax of the SCRN, which is technically a function because it returns a value, but does not use function-like syntax which would be {{code|A{{=}}SCRN(X,Y)}}.}}\n\n===Input/Output===\nInteger BASIC lacked any custom input/output commands, and also lacked the {{code|DATA}} statement and the associated {{code|READ}}. To get data into and out of a program, the input/output functionality was redirected to a selected [[Expansion card|card slot]] with the {{code|PR#x}} and {{code|IN#x}}, which redirected output or input (respectively) to the numbered slot. From then on, data could be sent to the card using conventional {{code|PRINT}} commands and read from it using {{code|INPUT}}.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}}\n\n===Other notes===\nInteger BASIC included a {{code|TAB}} feature, which positioned the cursor on a given column from 0 to 39. It differed from the versions found in most BASICs in that it was a command with a following number, as opposed to a function with the value in parenthesis; one would move the cursor to column 10 using {{code|TAB 10}} in Integer BASIC{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=73}} whereas in MS this would be {{code|PRINT TAB(10)}}. Additionally, the {{code|VTAB}} command worked similar to {{code|TAB}} but added vertical spaces instead of horizontal. For unexplained reasons, in this case the coordinates were from 1 to 24 rather than 0 to 23.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=74}}\n\nInteger BASIC included a {{code|POP}} command to exit from loops.{{sfn|Raskin|1978|p=120}} This popped the topmost item off the FOR stack. Atari BASIC also supported the same command,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.atarimania.com/documents/Atari-Basic-Reference-Manual-Rev-C.pdf |title=Atari BASIC Reference Manual |publisher=Atari |date=1983 |page=25}}</ref> while [[North Star BASIC]] used {{code|EXIT}}.<ref>{{cite book |title=North Star BASIC version 6 |url=http://itelsoft.com.au/north_star_manuals/North_Star_BASIC_Version_6.pdf |publisher=North Star Corporation |date=1977 |page=8}}</ref>\n\nThe Integer BASIC ROMs also included a [[machine code monitor]], \"mini-[[assembler (computing)|assembler]]\", and disassembler to create and debug [[assembly language]] programs. Wozniak hand-assembled the monitor as the Apple II's first program, then used it to write Integer BASIC.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}{{sfn|Helmers|1978|p=18}}{{sfn|Weyhrich|2001}}\n\n==Implementation==\n===Tokenizer===\nInteger BASIC read the lines typed in by the user from a buffer and ran them through a [[Parsing|parser]] which output a series of [[Lexical token|tokens]]. As part of this process, simple [[syntax error]]s are detected and listed. If the parsing is successful, the line number (if present) is converted from [[ASCII]] decimal format into a 16-bit integer, and any keywords into a 7-bit integer token.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}\n\nNumeric literals, like the value 500, were converted into their 16-bit (two-byte) binary representation, in this case, $01F4 [[hexidecimal]]. To indicate this was a value and not a keyword, a single byte between $B0 and $B9 was inserted in front of the two-byte value.{{efn|The first digit of the original value is used to select a value from 0 to 9, so in this example, the token would be $B5 for the first digit of 500.}} String literals, like \"HELLO WORLD\" were instead converted by setting the high bit of each character, so that {{code|A}} was stored as $C1. Variable names were converted in the same fashion, with the letters converted to have their high-bit turned on, and any digits in the name represented by the corresponding $B0 through $B9, so that the variable {{code|A5}} would be tokenized as $C1B5.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}\n\nIf the line was entered without a line number, the code was then executed directly from the buffer. If it had a line number, it was copied from the buffer into the program storage area.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}} The line in the buffer was first prefixed with a single byte containing the line length and postfixed with a $01 to indicate the end of the line (null was not used).{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe runtime interpreter used two stacks for execution, one for statement keywords and the other for evaluating the parameters. Each statement was given two priorities, one that stated where it should occur in a multi-step operation, like a string of mathematical operations to provide [[order of operations]], and another that suggested when evaluation should occur, for instance, calculating internal values of a parenthesis formula. When variables are encountered, their name is parsed and then looked up in the variable storage area. The address of the variable's storage, perhaps freshly created, is then placed on the evaluation stack.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=42}}\n\n===SWEET16===\n{{main|SWEET16}}\nInteger BASIC is partially implemented in a custom [[assembler language]] known as [[SWEET16]]. SWEET16 is based on [[bytecode]]s that run within a simple 16-bit [[virtual machine]]. This model was used so memory could be addressed via indirect 16-bit pointers and 16-bit math functions calculated without the need to translate those to the underlying multi-instruction 8-bit 6502 code. The entire virtual machine was written in only 300 bytes. Code can call SWEET16 by issuing a [[subroutine]] call, and then return to normal 6502 code when the 16-bit operations are complete.{{sfn|Wozniak|1977|p=43}}\n\n==Performance==\nBecause Integer BASIC processed more of the original [[source code]] into tokens, the runtime was faster than versions that required additional runtime parsing. For comparison, [[Tiny BASIC]] tokenized only the line number,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Build Your Own BASIC |first=Dennis |last=Allison |magazine=Dr. Dobb's Journal |volume=1 |number=1 |date=1976 |url=https://archive.org/details/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_01/page/n11 |page=11}}</ref> while MS BASICs tokenized only the keywords. So for instance, while Integer BASIC would convert the line {{code|100 GOTO 200}} entirely into tokens that could be immediately read and performed, in MS BASIC only the line number and GOTO would be tokenized, the \"100\" was left in its original format and had to be re-parsed every time.<ref name=altair>{{cite web |url=http://www.rjh.org.uk/altair/4k/int_dis_11.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011105014524/http://www.rjh.org.uk/altair/4k/int_dis_11.htm |archive-date=19 November 2001 |title=Altair BASIC 3.2 (4K) - Annotated Disassembly |first=Roger |last=Hardiman |page=1.11}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, working solely with integer math provides another major boost in speed. This is due both to the smaller 16-bit format requiring fewer memory accesses, as well as removing the need to move the floating-point decimal after calculations. As many [[computer benchmark]]s of the era were small and often performed simple math that did not require floating-point, Integer BASIC trounced most other BASICs.{{efn|[[Bill Gates]] complained about this, stating that it was unfair to compare Integer BASIC to a \"real\" BASIC like MS.<ref name=rugg2>{{cite magazine |first1=Tom |last1=Rugg |first2=Phil |last2=Feldman |title=BASIC timing comparisons\u2026 revised and updated |magazine=Kilobaud |date=October 1977 |pages=20\u201325 |url=https://archive.org/details/kilobaudmagazine-1977-10}}</ref>}}\n\nOn one of the earliest known microcomputer benchmarks, the [[Rugg/Feldman benchmarks]], Integer BASIC was well over twice as fast as Applesoft BASIC on the same machine.<ref name=rugg>{{cite magazine |first1=Tom |last1=Rugg |first2=Phil |last2=Feldman |title=BASIC Timing Comparisons\u2026 information for speed freaks |magazine=Kilobaud |date=June 1977 |pages=66\u201370 |url=https://archive.org/details/kilobaudmagazine-1977-06}}</ref> In the [[Byte Sieve]], where math was less important but array access and looping performance dominated, Integer BASIC took 166 seconds while Applesoft took 200.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=A High-Level Language Benchmark |first=Jim |last=Gilbreath |magazine=Byte |date=September 1981 |url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-09/page/n181 |page=192}}</ref> It did not appear in the [[Creative Computing Benchmark]], which was first published in 1983, by which time Integer BASIC was no longer supplied by default.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Creative Computing |date=November 1983 |first=David |last=Ahl |title=Benchmark Comparison Test |url=https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1983-11/page/n271/mode/2up |page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe following test series, taken from both of the original Rugg/Feldman articles,<ref name=rugg/><ref name=rugg2/> indicates several interesting points. Test 1 was simply a {{code|FOR...NEXT}} loop from 1 to 1000. In this test, Applesoft turns in a time identical to Integer. Both BASICs cache the location of the {{code|FOR}} so it can quickly return to that line when it reaches the {{code|NEXT}}. No math or line-lookups are performed, so the two are similar in speed. Test 2 is another loop from 1 to 1000, but differs in that it uses a {{code|IF...THEN}} with an implicit GOTO to perform the loop instead of a FOR/NEXT. In this case, Integer is almost three times as fast as Applesoft, which illustrates the gains of having pre-parsed the target line number. Test 3 adds simple arithmetic calculations to Test 2, taking an additional 4.1 seconds in Integer and 7.5 in MS. Test 4 replaces variables with numeric constants, this does not change the time needed for Integer as the constants are already parsed to 16-bit values, whereas it takes MS another 1.8 seconds as it repeatedly re-parses the numbers from ASCII to the 40-bit internal format. The remaining tests add {{code|GOSUB}} and array access, the former benefiting as in the case of THEN/GOTO, the later by performing the index lookup in the array using a 16-bit variable value rather than having to convert it from 40-bit floating-point variable.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
