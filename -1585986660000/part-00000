Though there may be databases available that appear more complete for general gene or protein searches, such as [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]], HADb and '''Autophagy database''' offer the most complete information on autophagy-related genes and proteins. The GUI is not fully refined for each, and may be harder to access, but each of these databases maintains focus on [[autophagy]], whereas [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] does not use the same focused approach on autophagy.

Others pointed to the fact that a previous integration of the many much smaller Borough Councils did not bring the promised advantages either, and reduced local participation in politics,<ref>''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=1501110&objectid=10399953 Lessons from the history of local body amalgamation]'' \u2013 ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Wednesday 6 September 2006</ref> with editorialists pointing out that the (supposedly mainly [[Wellington]]ian) proponents of the 'super city' have carefully not made any promises of savings in light of past rises in rates and utilities bills.<ref name=\"MOCKS\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the government set up a [[Royal Commission on Auckland Governance]] to report on what restructuring should be done.<ref>''[http://www.stuff.co.nz/0a11.html4147429a11.html Auckland governance inquiry welcomed]'' \u2013 [[NZPA]], via 'stuff.co.nz', Tuesday 31 July 2007.

This plan will cover matters such as the limits of residential development and the zoning and densities of the suburbs and areas, and will assess how elements like transport and land use are to be linked. It is intended to be one of the main documents out of which a unified [[District Plan]] will eventually grow. Some critics have noted that this spatial plan will need years to develop and CCOs would fill the policy vacuum in the meantime.

Including the proposed [[Auckland city centre rail tunnel|CBD rail tunnel]], these two transformations are costed at approximately $5.5 billion over 20 years.

The criticism ranged from the wards being too big (and thus throwing together communities with few common interests), to some ward boundary lines being drawn against the local understanding of what constituted their community.<ref name=\"GERRY\"/>\n\nMore serious criticism was centred around the fact that urban wards contained significantly more people than some rural wards (and thus received less influence in the future Council per person) and in regards to the small number of Councillors for all of Auckland (with fewer Councillors per head than Aucklanders have MPs representing them in Parliament),<ref name=\"UNFAIR\">{{cite web |url=http://transportblog.co.nz/2010/03/11/super-city-structure-still-unfair/ |title=Super City structure still unfair |date=11 March 2010 |work=Local Government Commission via Auckland Transport Blog |accessdate=15 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100313073340/http://transportblog.co.nz/2010/03/11/super-city-structure-still-unfair/| archivedate= 13 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> and the institution of two-member wards (meaning that contenders would have to field much larger and more costly election campaigns).

An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on ''Encore'', he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount&nbsp;[...] I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30\". The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem's weight increased to {{convert|230|lb|kg}}, and he was regularly eating [[fast food]]: \"The kids behind the counter knew me \u2013 it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad\". Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain, and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: \"Eminem ain't fat.\"<ref name=\"RS10\"/>\n\nIn December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a [[methadone]] overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". He continued to buy more until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of [[heroin]] and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children,<!-- What other children? So far, we've just read about Hailie. --> Eminem checked himself out of the facility weak and not fully [[Detoxification|detoxed]]. He tore the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a [[seizure]]. His drug use \"ramped right back to where it was before\" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program which emphasized running.
