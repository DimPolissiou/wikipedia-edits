Her first sound film, ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]], and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936), and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940), among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]], and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946); film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949); drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950); and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951), among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954), although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Silent films\n!

(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]\n\nThe '''Joan Crawford filmography''' lists the film appearances of American actress '''[[Joan Crawford]]''', who starred in numerous [[film|motion picture]]s throughout a lengthy career that spanned nearly five decades.\n\nShe made her film debut in ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' (1925), as a [[body double]] for film star [[Norma Shearer]]. She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]], ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film, ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]], and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936), and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940), among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]], and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946); film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949); drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950); and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951), among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954), although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Silent films\n!

The voyage would be the first military action for master's mate [[Joshua Barney]].{{sfnp|Barney|1832|p=29-32}}\n\nThere is some degree of discrepancy in dates concerning both the ''Hornet'' and the ship [[USS Wasp (1775)]], both of which fitted out in Baltimore. The biography of Joshua Barney claims that upon his return to Baltimore after a voyage aboard the ship ''Sydney'' (which he had taken command of after the death of her captain) he signed onto be first mate aboard the ''Hornet'' and was first tasked to recruit a crew. Part of the way he did this was by hoisting an \"American Flag\" provided from Philadelphia by Hopkins,{{sfnp|Barney|1832|p=30}} indicating the ships were already accepted into the fleet. The Naval Documents of the American Revolution, volume 2, pg 583 place the date of this return as 23 October 1775. Barney claims that after fitting out, both the ''Hornet'' and the ''Wasp'' sailed in company to join the fleet at Philadelphia at the end of November.{{sfnp|Barney|1832|p=30 last paragraph}}\n\nHowever, Colonial records show that on 2 December 1775, Col. Benjamin Harrison was dispatched to Baltimore to acquire 2-3 ships to be armed and augment Hopkin's fleet.{{sfnp|Clark|1966|p=1231}} These ships are identified as being the ''Hornet'' and the ''Wasp''.{{sfnp|Clark|1966|p=1264 footnotes}} Both vessels are noted by the Baltimore Committee as being fitting out as of 18 December 1775.{{sfnp|Clark|1968|p=163}} Both the ''Hornet'' and the ''Wasp'' are noted as joining the fleet in Philadelphia on 13 February 1776.{{sfnp|Clark|1968|p=1289}} Given the dates from the Colonial sources come from the records of government bodies in the course of their work and that the dates from Mary Barney's account come from family papers and recollections, it is more likely that Barney's dates are in error and that the events in question happened according to the later timeline. Hence, it is probably safer to say that the ''Hornet'' along with the ''Wasp'' was acquired by the Colonial Congress via the efforts of Col. Harrison between the 2nd and 18th of December, fitted out between the date of acquisition along with the ''Wasp'', and then were commissioned into the Colonial Navy on 13 February 1776 after joining the fleet in Philadelphia.\n\n''Hornet'' then sailed with Hopkins fleet 18 February 1776. Outside the [[Virginia Capes]], she ran afoul of [[USS Fly (1776)|USS ''Fly'']] and was unable to accompany the fleet for the [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] assault on [[New Providence]]. On 27 August 1776, Congress offer to purchase the ''Hornet'' from her owner, William Stone. {{sfnp|Lincoln|1906|p=16}} She patrolled in the [[Delaware Bay]] for nearly a year, then ran the British blockade to convoy merchantmen to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. Documents of service are incomplete after this time but it appears that ''Hornet'' fell into British hands on the coast of South Carolina in the summer of 1777.\n\n==Citations and References==\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist|30em}}\n'''References'''\n* Barney, Mary (1832) [https://archive.org/details/biographicalmemo02barn/page/n8 ''A Biographical Memour of the late Commodore Joshua Barney from Autographical Notes and Journals''] (Gray and Bowen, Boston)\n* Clark, William Bell, ed.

The voyage would be the first military action for master's mate [[Joshua Barney]].{{sfnp|Barney|1832|p=29-32}}\n\nThere is some degree of discrepancy in dates concerning both the ''Hornet'' and the ship [[USS Wasp (1775)]], both of which fitted out in Baltimore. The biography of Joshua Barney claims that upon his return to Baltimore after a voyage aboard the ship ''Sydney'' (which he had taken command of after the death of her captain) he signed onto be first mate aboard the ''Hornet'' and was first tasked to recruit a crew. Part of the way he did this was by hoisting an \"American Flag\" provided from Philadephia by Hopkins,{{sfnp|Barney|1832|p=30}} indicating the ships were already accepted into the fleet. The Naval Documents of the American Revolution, volume 2, pg 583 place the date of this return as 23 October 1775. Barney claims that after fitting out, both the ''Hornet'' and the ''Wasp'' sailed in company to join the fleet at Philadelphia at the end of November.{{sfnp|Barney|1832|p=30 last paragraph}}\n\nHowever, Colonial records show that on 2 December 1775, Col. Benjamin Harrison was dispatched to Baltimore to acquire 2-3 ships to be armed and augment Hopkin's fleet.{{sfnp|Clark|1966|p=1231}} These ships are identified as being the ''Hornet'' and the ''Wasp''.{{sfnp|Clark|1966|p=1264 footnotes}} Both vessels are noted by the Baltimore Committee as being fitting out as of 18 December 1775.{{sfnp|Clark|1968|p=163}} Both the ''Hornet'' and the ''Wasp'' are noted as joining the fleet in Philadelphia on 13 February 1776.{{sfnp|Clark|1968|p=1289}} Given the dates from the Colonial sources come from the records of government bodies in the course of their work and that the dates from Mary Barney's account come from family papers and recollections, it is more likely that Barney's dates are in error and that the events in question happened according to the later timeline. Hence, it is probably safer to say that the ''Hornet'' along with the ''Wasp'' was acquired by the Colonial Congress via the efforts of Col. Harrison between the 2nd and 18th of December, fitted out between the date of acquisition along with the ''Wasp'', and then were commissioned into the Colonial Navy on 13 February 1776 after joining the fleet in Philadelphia.\n\n''Hornet'' then sailed with Hopkins fleet 18 February 1776. Outside the [[Virginia Capes]], she ran afoul of [[USS Fly (1776)|USS ''Fly'']] and was unable to accompany the fleet for the [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] assault on [[New Providence]]. On 27 August 1776, Congress offer to purchase the ''Hornet'' from her owner, William Stone. {{sfnp|Lincoln|1906|p=16}} She patrolled in the [[Delaware Bay]] for nearly a year, then ran the British blockade to convoy merchantmen to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. Documents of service are incomplete after this time but it appears that ''Hornet'' fell into British hands on the coast of South Carolina in the summer of 1777.\n\n==Citations and References==\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist|30em}}\n'''References'''\n* Barney, Mary (1832) [https://archive.org/details/biographicalmemo02barn/page/n8 ''A Biographical Memour of the late Commodore Joshua Barney from Autographical Notes and Journals''] (Gray and Bowen, Boston)\n* Clark, William Bell, ed.
