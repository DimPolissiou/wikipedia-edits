Their 1993 hit \"[[Runaway Train (Soul Asylum song)|Runaway Train]]\" won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]].\n\nThe band was originally called '''Loud Fast Rules''', with a lineup consisting of [[Dave Pirner]], [[Dan Murphy (musician)|Dan Murphy]], [[Karl Mueller (rock musician)|Karl Mueller]], and Pat Morley.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book|title=The Great Rock Discography|last=Strong|first=Martin C.|publisher=Mojo Books|year=2000|isbn=1-84195-017-3|edition=5th|location=Edinburgh|pages=906\u2013907}}</ref> They changed their name to Soul Asylum in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5478|pure_url=yes}} |title=Soul Asylum |accessdate=June 20, 2007 |author=Sullivan, Denise |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Morley was replaced by [[Grant Young (musician)|Grant Young]] in 1984. The band recorded three albums with [[Twin/Tone Records]] and two with [[A&M Records]], with little commercial success. In 1992, they released the triple-platinum album ''[[Grave Dancers Union]]'', featuring  \"Runaway Train\". The band played at the inauguration of President [[Bill Clinton]] early the next year. They also scored a platinum record with the album ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'' three years later.\n\nIn 1998 they recorded ''[[Candy from a Stranger]].'' Mueller was diagnosed with cancer in 2004, and the band organized a benefit concert on his behalf. Mueller died a year later.\n\nThe band released four more albums over the next 15 years. Their most recent was ''Hurry Up and Wait'' in 2020, their twelfth studio release.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Luken |first1=Jeremy |title=Soul Asylum Retain Their Gritty Sonic Charm On \u2018Hurry Up and Wait\u2019 |url=https://glidemagazine.com/242520/soul-asylum-retain-their-gritty-sonic-charm-on-hurry-up-and-wait-album-review/ |publisher=Glide Magazine |accessdate=20 April 2020 |date=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years===\nThe group was an outgrowth of a previous band, Loud Fast Rules, formed in 1981 by drummer and lead vocalist Dave Pirner, guitarist and backing vocalist Dan Murphy, and bassist Karl Mueller.

Everything Can Happen'' was originally released on LP and cassette by local record label [[Twin/Tone]] as a nine-song EP. It is out of print but was re-released on CD as ''[[Say What You Will, Clarence...Karl Sold the Truck]]'', which includes five additional tracks that were cut from the original album. Between the release of ''Say What You Will'' and their second album, [[Grant Young (musician)|Grant Young]] joined the group, taking over the drums from Morley.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In 1986, Soul Asylum released three albums, ''[[Made to Be Broken]]'', ''[[Time's Incinerator]]'' (on cassette only) and ''[[While You Were Out (album)|While You Were Out]]''.\n\nThe band toured relentlessly in its early years, opening for other American touring bands and later performing as a headliner act after gaining exposure on the \"[[Flip Your Wig]]\" tour with the Minneapolis band [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]] in early 1986. Contrasted with some of the popular underground and alternative styles at the time, audiences were struck by the band's onstage swagger, scruffy Midwestern appearance and extremely loud, frenetic sound, mixing tuneful but unrestrained punk, hardcore, 1970s rock, country and self-effacing kitsch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/132soulasylum.htm |title=Soul Asylum : Library |website=Mnhs.Org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> One early review<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-04-07/entertainment/ca-21904_1_soul-asylum |title=Soul Asylum \u2013 Los Angeles Times |website=Articles.latimes.com |date=May 24, 1998 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> described their sound as \"some unholy mix of Kiss and Hank Williams thrown under the wheels of a runaway train.\" All elements contributed to the band's being described as a \"[[grunge]] precursor\", a claim often recited in comparisons between pre-Nirvana Minneapolis and Seattle bands. Despite critical acclaim locally and internationally, they remained unknown to a larger U.S. audience and radio market.\n\n===Mainstream popularity and success: 1988-1999===\n[[File:DavePirner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dave Pirner at a Soul Asylum concert in Germany in 1990]]\nThe group signed with [[A&M Records]] in 1988. Their first offering on that label was ''[[Clam Dip & Other Delights]]'' (1989), the title and cover art being a parody of ''[[Whipped Cream & Other Delights]]'', by A&M Records co-founder [[Herb Alpert]]. ''[[Hang Time (album)|Hang Time]]'' was released in 1988, followed by ''[[And the Horse They Rode In On]]'' in 1990 (produced by [[X-pensive Winos]] drummer [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]]). Because of poor sales and Pirner's hearing problems, the group considered disbanding.\n\nAfter playing a series of acoustic shows in the early 1990s, they were picked up by [[Columbia Records]]. In 1992 they released ''[[Grave Dancers Union]]'', which became their most popular album.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> On January 20, 1993, the group performed at the first [[inauguration]] of United States President [[Bill Clinton]]. Later that year, the band performed \"Sexual Healing\" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[No Alternative]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. The band added keyboard player Joey Huffman in the summer of 1993. He toured with the band until joining [[Matchbox Twenty]] in 1998. Huffman played on the albums ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'', ''[[After the Flood: Live from the Grand Forks Prom, June 28, 1997]]'', and ''[[The Silver Lining (Soul Asylum album)|The Silver Lining]]''. Soul Asylum won the 1994 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]] for \"[[Runaway Train (Soul Asylum song)|Runaway Train]]\". The music video for that song featured photographs and names of missing children, in the style of a public service announcement. At the end of the video, Pirner appeared and said, \"If you've seen one of these kids, or you are one of them, please call this number\", and then the telephone number of a missing children's help line was shown. For use outside the U.S., the video was edited to include photos and names of missing children from the area where the video would be shown. The video was instrumental in reuniting several children with their families.<ref name=PW>{{cite web |url=http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/article.php?id=3638&IssueNum=28 |title=Back on track |publisher=Pasadena Weekly |date=July 13, 2006 |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221164621/http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/article.php?id=3638&IssueNum=28 |archivedate=December 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBefore their next studio album, drummer Grant Young was fired and was replaced by [[Sterling Campbell]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=366}}</ref> Campbell had been credited as providing percussion on ''Grave Dancers Union'' (although he had actually done at least half of the drumming on that album).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sjmc.cla.umn.edu/stupro/resonance/article-1.htm |title=School of Journalism & Mass Communication : University of Minnesota |website=Sjmc.cla.umn.edu |date=April 1, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> The next release, ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'', included the track \"[[Misery (Soul Asylum song)|Misery]]\", which reached the Top 20, but the album was not as successful as the band's previous one.

The band recorded three albums with [[Twin/Tone Records]] and two with [[A&M Records]], with little commercial success. In 1992, they released the triple-platinum album ''[[Grave Dancers Union]]'', featuring  \"Runaway Train\". The band played at the inauguration of President [[Bill Clinton]] early the next year. They also scored a platinum record with the album ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'' three years later.\n\nIn 1998 they recorded ''[[Candy from a Stranger]].'' Mueller was diagnosed with cancer in 2004, and the band organized a benefit concert on his behalf. Mueller died a year later.\n\nThe band released four more albums over the next 15 years. Their most recent was ''Hurry Up and Wait'' in 2020, their twelfth studio release.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Luken |first1=Jeremy |title=Soul Asylum Retain Their Gritty Sonic Charm On \u2018Hurry Up and Wait\u2019 |url=https://glidemagazine.com/242520/soul-asylum-retain-their-gritty-sonic-charm-on-hurry-up-and-wait-album-review/ |publisher=Glide Magazine |accessdate=20 April 2020 |date=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years===\nThe group was an outgrowth of a previous band, Loud Fast Rules, formed in 1981 by drummer and lead vocalist Dave Pirner, guitarist and backing vocalist Dan Murphy, and bassist Karl Mueller.

Everything Can Happen'' was originally released on LP and cassette by local record label [[Twin/Tone]] as a nine-song EP. It is out of print but was re-released on CD as ''[[Say What You Will, Clarence...Karl Sold the Truck]]'', which includes five additional tracks that were cut from the original album. Between the release of ''Say What You Will'' and their second album, [[Grant Young (musician)|Grant Young]] joined the group, taking over the drums from Morley.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In 1986, Soul Asylum released three albums, ''[[Made to Be Broken]]'', ''[[Time's Incinerator]]'' (on cassette only) and ''[[While You Were Out (album)|While You Were Out]]''.\n\nThe band toured relentlessly in its early years, opening for other American touring bands and later performing as a headliner act after gaining exposure on the \"[[Flip Your Wig]]\" tour with the Minneapolis band [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]] in early 1986. Contrasted with some of the popular underground and alternative styles at the time, audiences were struck by the band's onstage swagger, scruffy Midwestern appearance and extremely loud, frenetic sound, mixing tuneful but unrestrained punk, hardcore, 1970s rock, country and self-effacing kitsch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/132soulasylum.htm |title=Soul Asylum : Library |website=Mnhs.Org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> One early review<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-04-07/entertainment/ca-21904_1_soul-asylum |title=Soul Asylum \u2013 Los Angeles Times |website=Articles.latimes.com |date=May 24, 1998 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> described their sound as \"some unholy mix of Kiss and Hank Williams thrown under the wheels of a runaway train.\" All elements contributed to the band's being described as a \"[[grunge]] precursor\", a claim often recited in comparisons between pre-Nirvana Minneapolis and Seattle bands. Despite critical acclaim locally and internationally, they remained unknown to a larger U.S. audience and radio market.\n\n===Mainstream popularity and success: 1988-1999===\n[[File:DavePirner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dave Pirner at a Soul Asylum concert in Germany in 1990]]\nThe group signed with [[A&M Records]] in 1988. Their first offering on that label was ''[[Clam Dip & Other Delights]]'' (1989), the title and cover art being a parody of ''[[Whipped Cream & Other Delights]]'', by A&M Records co-founder [[Herb Alpert]]. ''[[Hang Time (album)|Hang Time]]'' was released in 1988, followed by ''[[And the Horse They Rode In On]]'' in 1990 (produced by [[X-pensive Winos]] drummer [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]]). Because of poor sales and Pirner's hearing problems, the group considered disbanding.\n\nAfter playing a series of acoustic shows in the early 1990s, they were picked up by [[Columbia Records]]. In 1992 they released ''[[Grave Dancers Union]]'', which became their most popular album.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> On January 20, 1993, the group performed at the first [[inauguration]] of United States President [[Bill Clinton]]. Later that year, the band performed \"Sexual Healing\" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[No Alternative]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. The band added keyboard player Joey Huffman in the summer of 1993. He toured with the band until joining [[Matchbox Twenty]] in 1998. Huffman played on the albums ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'', ''[[After the Flood: Live from the Grand Forks Prom, June 28, 1997]]'', and ''[[The Silver Lining (Soul Asylum album)|The Silver Lining]]''. Soul Asylum won the 1994 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]] for \"[[Runaway Train (Soul Asylum song)|Runaway Train]]\". The music video for that song featured photographs and names of missing children, in the style of a public service announcement. At the end of the video, Pirner appeared and said, \"If you've seen one of these kids, or you are one of them, please call this number\", and then the telephone number of a missing children's help line was shown. For use outside the U.S., the video was edited to include photos and names of missing children from the area where the video would be shown. The video was instrumental in reuniting several children with their families.<ref name=PW>{{cite web |url=http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/article.php?id=3638&IssueNum=28 |title=Back on track |publisher=Pasadena Weekly |date=July 13, 2006 |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221164621/http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/article.php?id=3638&IssueNum=28 |archivedate=December 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBefore their next studio album, drummer Grant Young was fired and was replaced by [[Sterling Campbell]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=366}}</ref> Campbell had been credited as providing percussion on ''Grave Dancers Union'' (although he had actually done at least half of the drumming on that album).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sjmc.cla.umn.edu/stupro/resonance/article-1.htm |title=School of Journalism & Mass Communication : University of Minnesota |website=Sjmc.cla.umn.edu |date=April 1, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> The next release, ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'', included the track \"[[Misery (Soul Asylum song)|Misery]]\", which reached the Top 20, but the album was not as successful as the band's previous one.

Pirner said, \"It's sort of sad to say, but you could see the whole grunge-rock-band thing getting totally over-saturated and people were looking for something new.\" The band took a step back; Pirner explained, \"We needed to reassess how far we've gone and how much further we're going to go and which way we want to go and what we do right and what we do wrong.

The [[Governor (United States)|governor]] is the head of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of [[Government of Alabama|Alabama's state government]] and is charged with enforcing state laws.\n\nThere have officially been 54 governors of the state of Alabama; this official numbering skips acting and military governors.<ref name=\"adah\" /> The first governor, [[William Wyatt Bibb]], served as the only governor of the [[Alabama Territory]]. 5 people have served as acting governor, bringing the total number of people serving as governor to 59, spread over 63 distinct terms. Four governors have served multiple non-consecutive terms: [[Bibb Graves]], [[Jim Folsom]], and [[Fob James]] each served two, and [[George Wallace]] served three non-consecutive periods. Officially, these non-consecutive terms are numbered only with the number of their first term. [[William D. Jelks]] also served non-consecutive terms, but his first term was in an acting capacity.\n\nThe longest-serving governor was George Wallace, who served 16 years over four terms. The shortest term for a non-acting governor was that of [[Hugh McVay]], who served four and a half months after replacing the resigning [[Clement Comer Clay]]. [[Lurleen Wallace]], wife of George Wallace, was the first woman to serve as governor of Alabama, and the third woman to serve as governor of any state. The current governor is Republican [[Kay Ivey]], who took office on April 10, 2017 following Governor [[Robert J. Bentley]]'s court-mandated resignation following a guilty plea-deal amidst a corruption scandal. She is the second female governor of Alabama.\n\n==Governors==\n\n===Governor of the Territory of Alabama===\n[[Alabama Territory]] was formed on March 3, 1817, from [[Mississippi Territory]].

It seceded from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] on January 11, 1861, and was a founding member of the [[Confederate States of America]] on February 4, 1861. Following the end of the [[American Civil War]], Alabama during [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] was part of the [[Third Military District]], which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Alabama was readmitted to the Union on July 14, 1868.\n\nThe first [[Constitution of Alabama|Alabama Constitution]], ratified in 1819, provided that a governor be elected every two years, limited to serve no more than 4 out of every 6 years.<ref>1819 Const. art. IV, \u00a7 4</ref> This limit remained in place until the constitution of 1868, which simply allowed governors to serve terms of two years.<ref>1868 Const. art.

The [[Governor (United States)|governor]] is the head of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of [[Government of Alabama|Alabama's state government]] and is charged with enforcing state laws.\n\nThere have officially been 54 governors of the state of Alabama; this official numbering skips acting and military governors.<ref name=\"adah\" /> The first governor, [[William Wyatt Bibb]], served as the only governor of the [[Alabama Territory]]. 5 people have served as acting governor, bringing the total number of people serving as governor to 59, spread over 63 distinct terms. Four governors have served multiple non-consecutive terms: [[Bibb Graves]], [[Jim Folsom]], and [[Fob James]] each served two, and [[George Wallace]] served three non-consecutive periods. Officially, these non-consecutive terms are numbered only with the number of their first term. [[William D. Jelks]] also served non-consecutive terms, but his first term was in an acting capacity.\n\nThe longest-serving governor was George Wallace, who served 16 years over four terms. The shortest term for a non-acting governor was that of [[Hugh McVay]], who served four and a half months after replacing the resigning [[Clement Comer Clay]]. [[Lurleen Wallace]], wife of George Wallace, was the first woman to serve as governor of Alabama, and the third woman to serve as governor of any state. The current governor is Republican [[Kay Ivey]], who took office on April 10, 2017 following Governor [[Robert J. Bentley]]'s court-mandated resignation following a guilty plea-deal amidst a corruption scandal. She is the second female governor of Alabama.\n\n==Governors==\n\n===Governor of the Territory of Alabama===\n[[Alabama Territory]] was formed on March 3, 1817, from [[Mississippi Territory]].

It seceded from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] on January 11, 1861, and was a founding member of the [[Confederate States of America]] on February 4, 1861. Following the end of the [[American Civil War]], Alabama during [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] was part of the [[Third Military District]], which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Alabama was readmitted to the Union on July 14, 1868.\n\nThe first [[Constitution of Alabama|Alabama Constitution]], ratified in 1819, provided that a governor be elected every two years, limited to serve no more than 4 out of every 6 years.<ref>1819 Const. art. IV, \u00a7 4</ref> This limit remained in place until the constitution of 1868, which simply allowed governors to serve terms of two years.<ref>1868 Const. art.
