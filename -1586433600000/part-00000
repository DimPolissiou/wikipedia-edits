Due to the large number of players now serving in the [[First World War]] it was agreed to relax transfer rules to allow players from stronger teams to join weaker teams to even the competition.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Prospects for the Season\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIV, Issue 16529\n| date = 1917-05-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170503.2.96.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-15}}</ref> It was noted how many men from various clubs had been killed in battle by the beginning of 1917. They were Cecil Walker, Doug Dawson, T Marshall ([[Grafton Athletic]]), [[Charles Savory]], T McWhirter, G Cook, N Vause, V McCollum, Alf Gault, T Lambert, E Tiernan, F Stubbs, W. G. Handle ([[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]), B Hart, F Gladding, A Powley, Chas Mann ([[North Shore Albions]]), [[William Moeki]], G Jones, W Harris, S Magee, S Greer ([[City Rovers]]), A Miller, C Sinton, and L O'Leary (Sunnyside). City Rovers had sent ninety men to war by this time and twenty-one had been wounded and five killed. The Sunnyside club had only nine members left and one of those who had gone to the war (W Shaughnessey) said that in the trenches he had made a list of league players from various clubs which totaled 120. All three of the Sunnyside secretaries had enlisted and the executive was also gone. Ponsonby had also had over eighty of its member join the war effort.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =At the Front/Footballers Distinguish Themselves\n| page =6\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 107\n| date = 1917-05-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170505.2.50\n| accessdate = 2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\nThirty three teams entered the six grades. This was down on previous seasons due to the number of men who had gone to fight. In the senior grade there were still six teams entered, with five second grade teams, five third grade teams, nine fourth grade teams, six fifth grade teams, and four sixth grade teams. The season was notable for the fact that [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] was forced to drop out of the first grade competition after round 4 as it struggled to field senior players. [[Grafton Athletic]] also fell by the way-side soon after for the same reason.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history. They also won the Roope Rooster trophy for the first time with a 12\u20136 win over [[City Rovers]] in the final. By winning both competitions they became the second Auckland senior club to win multiple trophies in the same [[Auckland Rugby League club trophies|season]] following on the footsteps of [[City Rovers]] who had won both titles the year prior.\n\nAt the season end rather than a strong representative program which had been a feature of earlier years several charity and exhibition matches were played instead. These included a match versus the victorious [[Auckland Rugby Union]] club champions Railway. The team in its entirety switched to the rugby league code. They played matches with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[City Rovers]] at the end of the season. The team would go on to struggle for numbers itself in 1918 before eventually amalgamating with [[Grafton Athletic]].\n\nIn 1916 the fence around [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] had been removed by the council which made it very difficult to collect gate revenue. The league had however secured land which would be developed as [[Carlaw Park]] with the aim being to secure the ground and gain revenue from ticket sales in the future.\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=9th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1917}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1918 Auckland Rugby League season|1918]]}}\n        {{end}}\n\n==First Grade Championship==\nTwenty three first grade season matches were played which was less than previous seasons but owing to the fact that both [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] and [[Grafton Athletic]] were forced to drop out of the competition due to a lack of players as a result of so many leaving to join the war effort. After their Round 4 default to North Shore where only two Otahuhu players turned up they decided to amalgamate senior teams with Grafton.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Otahuhu V North Shore\n| page =7 \n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 140\n| date = 1917-06-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170613.2.72.2\n| accessdate = 2020-01-21}}</ref> This was short lived however as Grafton themselves only lasted until Round 7 when they themselves defaulted a week later.

City Rovers had sent ninety men to war by this time and twenty-one had been wounded and five killed. The Sunnyside club had only nine members left and one of those who had gone to the war (W Shaughnessey) said that in the trenches he had made a list of league players from various clubs which totaled 120.

This was down on previous seasons due to the number of men who had gone to fight. In the senior grade there were still six teams entered, with five second grade teams, five third grade teams, nine fourth grade teams, six fifth grade teams, and four sixth grade teams. The season was notable for the fact that [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] was forced to drop out of the first grade competition after round 4 as it struggled to field senior players. [[Grafton Athletic]] also fell by the way-side soon after for the same reason.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history.

By winning both competitions they became the second Auckland senior club to win multiple trophies in the same [[Auckland Rugby League club trophies|season]] following on the footsteps of [[City Rovers]] who had won both titles the year prior.\n\nAt the season end rather than a strong representative program which had been a feature of earlier years several charity and exhibition matches were played instead. These included a match versus the victorious [[Auckland Rugby Union]] club champions Railway. The team in its entirety switched to the rugby league code. They played matches with [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[City Rovers]] at the end of the season. The team would go on to struggle for numbers itself in 1918 before eventually amalgamating with [[Grafton Athletic]].\n\nIn 1916 the fence around [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] had been removed by the council which made it very difficult to collect gate revenue.

With the aid of disguises, the ninja gathered information on enemy terrain and building specifications, as well as obtaining passwords and communiques. The aforementioned supplement to the ''Nochi Kagami'' briefly describes the ninja's role in espionage:\n\n{{quote|Concerning ninja, they were said to be from Iga and K\u014dga, and went freely into enemy castles in secret.

A ''ch\u016bnin'' captain led a force of 48 ninja into the castle by means of deception. In a technique dubbed ''bakemono-jutsu'' (\"ghost technique\"), his men stole a lantern bearing the enemy's family crest (''[[Mon (crest)|mon]]''), and proceeded to make replicas with the same ''mon''. By wielding these lanterns, they were allowed to enter the castle without a fight. Once inside, the ninja set fire to the castle, and Yoshitaka's army would later emerge victorious.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 43\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=43}}</ref> The mercenary nature of the ''shinobi'' is demonstrated in another arson attack soon after the burning of Sawayama Castle. In 1561, commanders acting under [[Kizawa Nagamasa]] hired three Iga ninja of ''genin'' rank to assist the conquest of a fortress in [[Maibara, Shiga|Maibara]]. Rokkaku Yoshitaka, the same man who had hired Iga ninja just years earlier, was the fortress holder\u2014and target of attack. The ''Asai Sandaiki'' writes of their plans: \"We employed ''shinobi-no-mono'' of Iga... They were contracted to set fire to the castle\".<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 43 44\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=43\u201344}}</ref> However, the mercenary ''shinobi'' were unwilling to take commands. When the fire attack did not begin as scheduled, the Iga men told the commanders, who were not from the region, that they could not possibly understand the tactics of the ''shinobi''. They then threatened to abandon the operation if they were not allowed to act on their own strategy. The fire was eventually set, allowing Nagamasa's army to capture the fortress in a chaotic rush.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 43 44\" />\n\n===Assassination===\nThe best-known cases of assassination attempts involve famous historical figures. Deaths of famous persons have sometimes been attributed to assassination by ninja, but the secretive natures of these scenarios have made them difficult to prove.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 5\" /> Assassins were often identified as ninja later on, but there is no evidence to prove whether some were specially trained for the task or simply a hired thug.\n\n[[File:Oda Nobunaga-Portrait by Giovanni NIcolao.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Oda Nobunaga, by [[Jesuit]] painter [[Giovanni Niccol\u00f2]], 1583\u20131590]]\n\nThe warlord [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s notorious reputation led to several attempts on his life. In 1571, a K\u014dga ninja and [[sharpshooter]] by the name of Sugitani Zenjub\u014d was hired to assassinate Nobunaga.

However, this also ended in failure, and Manabe was forced to commit suicide, after which his body was openly displayed in public.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 31\" /> According to a document, the ''Iranki'', when Nobunaga was inspecting Iga province\u2014which his army had devastated\u2014a group of three ninja shot at him with large-caliber firearms.

A ninja named [[Kirigakure Saiz\u014d]] (possibly Kirigakure Shikaemon) thrust a spear through the floorboards to kill Hideyoshi, but was unsuccessful. He was \"smoked out\" of his hiding place by another ninja working for Hideyoshi, who apparently used a sort of primitive \"[[flamethrower]]\".<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 32\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=32}}</ref> Unfortunately, the veracity of this account has been clouded by later fictional publications depicting Saiz\u014d as one of the legendary [[Sanada Ten Braves]].\n\n[[Uesugi Kenshin]], the famous ''daimy\u014d'' of [[Echigo Province]], was rumored to have been killed by a ninja. The legend credits his death to an assassin who is said to have hidden in Kenshin's lavatory, and fatally injured Kenshin by thrusting a blade or spear into his [[anus]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Nihon Hakugaku Kurabu|2006|p=36}}</ref> While historical records showed that Kenshin suffered abdominal problems, modern historians have generally attributed his death to [[stomach cancer]], [[esophageal cancer]] or [[cerebrovascular disease]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Nihon Hakugaku Kurabu|2004|pp=51\u201353}}; {{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=32}}</ref>\n\n===Psychological warfare===\nIn battle, the ninja were also used to cause confusion amongst the enemy.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 42\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=42}}</ref> A degree of [[psychological warfare]] in the capturing of enemy banners can be seen illustrated in the ''\u014cu Eikei Gunki'', composed between the 16th and 17th centuries:\n\n{{quote|Within Hataya castle there was a glorious ''shinobi'' whose skill was renowned, and one night he entered the enemy camp secretly.

Here the ninja reportedly gave Naomasa a \"black medicine\" meant to stop bleeding.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 48\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=48}}</ref>\n\nWith the fall of the Iga and K\u014dga clans, ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' could no longer recruit professional ninja, and were forced to train their own ''shinobi''. The ''shinobi'' was considered a real profession, as demonstrated in the [[bakufu]]'s 1649 law on military service, which declared that only ''daimy\u014ds'' with an income of over 10,000 ''[[koku]]'' were allowed to retain ''shinobi''.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 13\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=13}}</ref> In the two centuries that followed, a number of ''ninjutsu'' manuals were written by descendants of Hattori Hanz\u014d as well as members of the Fujibayashi clan, an offshoot of the Hattori. Major examples include the ''[[Ninpiden]]'' (1655), the ''[[Bansenshukai]]'' (1675), and the ''[[Sh\u014dninki]]'' (1681).<ref name=\"Green 2001 358\" />\n\n[[Schools of Ninjutsu|Modern schools that claim to train ''ninjutsu'']] arose from the 1970s, including that of [[Masaaki Hatsumi]] ([[Bujinkan]]), [[Stephen K.

The lineage and authenticity of these schools are a matter of controversy.\n\n===Tactics===\nThe ninja did not always work alone. Teamwork techniques exist: For example, in order to scale a wall, a group of ninja may carry each other on their backs, or provide a human platform to assist an individual in reaching greater heights.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 22\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=22}}</ref> The ''Mikawa Go Fudoki'' gives an account where a coordinated team of attackers used [[password]]s to communicate. The account also gives a case of deception, where the attackers dressed in the same clothes as the defenders, causing much confusion.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 44 46\" /> When a retreat was needed during the [[Siege of Osaka]], ninja were commanded to fire upon friendly troops from behind, causing the troops to charge backwards in order to attack a perceived enemy. This tactic was used again later on as a method of crowd dispersal.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 50\" />\n\nMost ''ninjutsu'' techniques recorded in scrolls and manuals revolve around ways to avoid detection, and methods of escape.<ref name=\"Green 2001 358\" /> These techniques were loosely grouped under corresponding natural elements. Some examples are:\n\n* ''Hitsuke'': The practice of distracting guards by starting a fire away from the ninja's planned point of entry.

The popular notion of black clothing is likely rooted in artistic convention; early drawings of ninja showed them dressed in black in order to portray a sense of invisibility.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 17\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=17}}; Turnbull uses the name ''Buke Meimokush\u014d'', an alternate reading for the same title. The ''Buke My\u014dmokush\u014d'' cited here is a much more common reading.</ref> This convention was an idea borrowed from the puppet handlers of ''[[bunraku]]'' theater, who dressed in total black in an effort to simulate [[Theatrical property|props]] moving independently of their controls.<ref name=\"Howell 1999 211\">{{Harvnb|Howell|1999|p=211}}</ref> Despite the lack of hard evidence, it has been put forward by some authorities that black robes, perhaps slightly tainted with red to hide bloodstains, was indeed the sensible garment of choice for infiltration.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 17\" />\n\nClothing used was similar to that of the [[samurai]], but loose garments (such as leggings) were tucked into trousers or secured with belts. The ''[[tenugui]]'', a piece of cloth also used in martial arts, had many functions. It could be used to cover the face, form a belt, or assist in climbing.\n\nThe historicity of armor specifically made for ninja cannot be ascertained. While pieces of light armor purportedly worn by ninja exist and date to the right time, there is no hard evidence of their use in ninja operations. Depictions of famous persons later deemed ninja often show them in [[Japanese armour|samurai armor]]. There were lightweight concealable types of armour made with [[Kusari (Japanese mail armour)|''kusari'']] (chain armour) and small armor plates such as [[Karuta (Japanese armour)|''karuta'']] that could have been worn by ninja including ''katabira'' (jackets) made with armour hidden between layers of cloth. Shin and arm guards, along with metal-reinforced hoods are also speculated to make up the ninja's armor.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 17\" />\n\n===Tools===\n[[File:Ninpiden kuroro kagi breaker.gif|thumb|left|180px|A page from the ''[[Ninpiden]]'', showing a tool for breaking locks.]]\nTools used for infiltration and espionage are some of the most abundant artifacts related to the ninja. Ropes and [[grappling hook]]s were common, and were tied to the belt.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 19\" /> A collapsible ladder is illustrated in the ''Bansenshukai'', featuring spikes at both ends to anchor the ladder.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 20\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=20}}</ref> Spiked or hooked climbing gear worn on the hands and feet also doubled as weapons.<ref name=\"Mol 2003 121\">{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=121}}</ref> Other implements include [[chisel]]s, [[hammer]]s, [[drill]]s, [[pickaxe|picks]] and so forth.\n\nThe ''[[kunai]]'' was a heavy pointed tool, possibly derived from the Japanese [[masonry]] [[trowel]], which it closely resembles. Although it is often portrayed in popular culture as a weapon, the ''kunai'' was primarily used for gouging holes in walls.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 61\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=61}}</ref> Knives and small saws (''hamagari'') were also used to create holes in buildings, where they served as a foothold or a passage of entry.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 20 21\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=20\u201321}}</ref> A portable listening device (''saoto hikigane'') was used to eavesdrop on conversations and detect sounds.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 21\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[mizugumo]]'' was a set of wooden shoes supposedly allowing the ninja to walk on water.<ref name=\"draeger smith 1981 128\" /> They were meant to work by distributing the wearer's weight over the shoes' wide bottom surface. The word ''mizugumo'' is derived from the native name for the [[Japanese water spider]] (''Argyroneta aquatica japonica''). The ''mizugumo'' was featured on the show ''[[MythBusters]]'', where it was demonstrated unfit for walking on water. The ''ukidari'', a similar footwear for walking on water, also existed in the form of a flat round [[bucket]], but was probably quite unstable.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 62\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=62}}</ref> Inflatable skins and breathing tubes allowed the ninja to stay underwater for longer periods of time.<ref name=\"ratti 1991 329\">{{Harvnb|Ratti|Westbrook|1991|p=329}}</ref>\n\nDespite the large array of tools available to the ninja, the ''Bansenshukai'' warns one not to be overburdened with equipment, stating \"a successful ninja is one who uses but one tool for multiple tasks\".<ref name=\"Green 2001 359\">{{Harvnb|Green|2001|p=359}}</ref>\n\n===Weaponry===\nAlthough shorter swords and daggers were used, the ''[[katana]]'' was probably the ninja's weapon of choice, and was sometimes carried on the back.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 18\" /> The katana had several uses beyond normal combat. In dark places, the scabbard could be extended out of the sword, and used as a long probing device.<ref name=\"Adams 1970 52\">{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=52}}</ref> The sword could also be laid against the wall, where the ninja could use the sword guard (''[[tsuba]]'') to gain a higher foothold.<ref name=\"Adams 1970 49\">{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=49}}</ref> The katana could even be used as a device to stun enemies before attacking them, by putting a combination of red pepper, dirt or dust, and iron filings into the area near the top of the scabbard, so that as the sword was drawn the concoction would fly into the enemy's eyes, stunning him until a lethal blow could be made. While straight swords were used before the invention of the katana,<ref name=\"Reed 1880 269 270\">{{Harvnb|Reed|1880|pp=269\u2013270}}</ref> the straight ''[[ninjat\u014d]]'' has no historical precedent and is likely a modern invention.\n\n[[File:Kusarigama-crop.jpg|thumb|A pair of ''[[kusarigama]]'', on display in [[Iwakuni Castle]]]]\n\nAn array of [[Dart (missile)|darts]], spikes, knives, and sharp, star-shaped discs were known collectively as ''[[shuriken]]''. While not exclusive to the ninja,<ref name=\"Mol 2003 119\">{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=119}}</ref> they were an important part of the arsenal, where they could be thrown in any direction.<ref name=\"ratti 1991 328 329\">{{Harvnb|Ratti|Westbrook|1991|pp=328\u2013329}}</ref> Bows were used for sharpshooting, and some ninjas' bows were intentionally made smaller than the traditional ''[[yumi]]'' (longbow).<ref name=\"ratti 1991 328\">{{Harvnb|Ratti|Westbrook|1991|p=328}}</ref> The chain and sickle (''[[kusarigama]]'') was also used by the ninja.<ref name=\"Adams 1970 55\">{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=55}}</ref> This weapon consisted of a weight on one end of a chain, and a sickle (''[[Kama (weapon)|kama]]'') on the other. The weight was swung to injure or disable an opponent, and the sickle used to kill at close range. \n\nExplosives introduced from [[China]] were known in Japan by the time of the [[Mongol Invasions of Japan|Mongol Invasions]] in the 13th century.<ref name=\"Bunch Hellemans2004 161\">{{Harvnb|Bunch|Hellemans|2004|p=161}}</ref> Later, explosives such as hand-held bombs and grenades were adopted by the ninja.<ref name=\"ratti 1991 329\" /> Soft-cased bombs were designed to release smoke or poison gas, along with fragmentation explosives packed with iron or ceramic [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 22\" />\n\nAlong with common weapons, a large assortment of miscellaneous arms were associated with the ninja. Some examples include poison,<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 19\" /> ''[[makibishi]]'' (caltrops),<ref name=\"Mol 2003 176\">{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=176}}</ref> cane swords (''[[shikomizue]]''),<ref name=\"Mol 2003 195\">{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=195}}</ref> land mines,<ref name=\"draeger smith 1981 127\">{{Harvnb|Draeger|Smith|1981|p=127}}</ref> ''[[fukiya]]'' (blowguns), poisoned darts, [[acid]]-spurting tubes, and firearms.<ref name=\"ratti 1991 329\" /> The ''happ\u014d'', a small eggshell filled with blinding powder (''[[metsubushi]]''), was also used to facilitate escape.<ref name=\"Mol 2003 124\">{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=124}}</ref>\n\n==Legendary abilities==\n[[Superhuman]] or [[supernatural]] powers were often associated with the ninja. Some legends include [[flight]], [[invisibility]], [[shapeshifting]], the ability to \"split\" into multiple bodies (''bunshin''), the summoning of animals (''kuchiyose''), and control over the [[Five elements (Japanese philosophy)|five classical elements]]. These fabulous notions have stemmed from popular imagination regarding the ninja's mysterious status, as well as romantic ideas found in later Japanese art of the [[Edo period]]. Magical powers were sometimes rooted in the ninja's own efforts to disseminate fanciful information. For example, Nakagawa Shoshujin, the 17th-century founder of Nakagawa-ry\u016b, claimed in his own writings (''Okufuji Monogatari'') that he had the ability to transform into birds and animals.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 13\" />\n\nPerceived control over the elements may be grounded in real tactics, which were categorized by association with forces of nature. For example, the practice of starting fires in order to cover a ninja's trail falls under ''katon-no-jutsu'' (\"fire techniques\").<ref name=\"Mol 2003 176\" />\n\n[[File:Actor-as-nikki-danjo-kunisada-1857.jpg|thumb|upright|Actor portraying Nikki Danj\u014d, a villain from the kabuki play ''Sendai Hagi''.

[[Kunisada]], 1857.]]\n\nThe ninja's adaption of [[kite]]s in espionage and warfare is another subject of legends. Accounts exist of ninja being lifted into the air by kites, where they flew over hostile terrain and descended into, or dropped bombs on enemy territory.<ref name=\"draeger smith 1981 128\" /> Kites were indeed used in Japanese warfare, but mostly for the purpose of sending messages and relaying signals.<ref name=\"Buckley 2002 257\">{{Harvnb|Buckley|2002|p=257}}</ref> Turnbull suggests that kites lifting a man into midair might have been technically feasible, but states that the use of kites to form a human \"[[Hang gliding|hang glider]]\" falls squarely in the realm of fantasy.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 22 23\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\n===Kuji-kiri===\n''[[Kuji-kiri]]'' is an esoteric practice which, when performed with an array of hand \"seals\" (''[[kuji-in]]''), was meant to allow the ninja to enact superhuman feats.\n\nThe ''kuji'' (\"nine characters\") is a concept originating from [[Daoism]], where it was a string of nine words used in charms and incantations.<ref name=\"Waterhouse 1996 2 3\">{{Harvnb|Waterhouse|1996|pp=2\u20133}}</ref> In [[China]], this tradition mixed with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] beliefs, assigning each of the nine words to a Buddhist deity.

With the aid of disguises, the ninja gathered information on enemy terrain and building specifications, as well as obtaining passwords and communiques. The aforementioned supplement to the ''Nochi Kagami'' briefly describes the ninja's role in espionage:\n\n{{quote|Concerning ninja, they were said to be from Iga and K\u014dga, and went freely into enemy castles in secret.

A ''ch\u016bnin'' captain led a force of 48 ninja into the castle by means of deception. In a technique dubbed ''bakemono-jutsu'' (\"ghost technique\"), his men stole a lantern bearing the enemy's family crest (''[[Mon (crest)|mon]]''), and proceeded to make replicas with the same ''mon''. By wielding these lanterns, they were allowed to enter the castle without a fight. Once inside, the ninja set fire to the castle, and Yoshitaka's army would later emerge victorious.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 43\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=43}}</ref> The mercenary nature of the ''shinobi'' is demonstrated in another arson attack soon after the burning of Sawayama Castle. In 1561, commanders acting under [[Kizawa Nagamasa]] hired three Iga ninja of ''genin'' rank to assist the conquest of a fortress in [[Maibara, Shiga|Maibara]]. Rokkaku Yoshitaka, the same man who had hired Iga ninja just years earlier, was the fortress holder\u2014and target of attack. The ''Asai Sandaiki'' writes of their plans: \"We employed ''shinobi-no-mono'' of Iga... They were contracted to set fire to the castle\".<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 43 44\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=43\u201344}}</ref> However, the mercenary ''shinobi'' were unwilling to take commands. When the fire attack did not begin as scheduled, the Iga men told the commanders, who were not from the region, that they could not possibly understand the tactics of the ''shinobi''. They then threatened to abandon the operation if they were not allowed to act on their own strategy. The fire was eventually set, allowing Nagamasa's army to capture the fortress in a chaotic rush.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 43 44\" />\n\n===Assassination===\nThe best-known cases of assassination attempts involve famous historical figures. Deaths of famous persons have sometimes been attributed to assassination by ninja, but the secretive natures of these scenarios have made them difficult to prove.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 5\" /> Assassins were often identified as ninja later on, but there is no evidence to prove whether some were specially trained for the task or simply a hired thug.\n\n[[File:Oda Nobunaga-Portrait by Giovanni NIcolao.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Oda Nobunaga, by [[Jesuit]] painter [[Giovanni Niccol\u00f2]], 1583\u20131590]]\n\nThe warlord [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s notorious reputation led to several attempts on his life. In 1571, a K\u014dga ninja and [[sharpshooter]] by the name of Sugitani Zenjub\u014d was hired to assassinate Nobunaga.

However, this also ended in failure, and Manabe was forced to commit suicide, after which his body was openly displayed in public.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 31\" /> According to a document, the ''Iranki'', when Nobunaga was inspecting Iga province\u2014which his army had devastated\u2014a group of three ninja shot at him with large-caliber firearms.

A ninja named [[Kirigakure Saiz\u014d]] (possibly Kirigakure Shikaemon) thrust a spear through the floorboards to kill Hideyoshi, but was unsuccessful. He was \"smoked out\" of his hiding place by another ninja working for Hideyoshi, who apparently used a sort of primitive \"[[flamethrower]]\".<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 32\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=32}}</ref> Unfortunately, the veracity of this account has been clouded by later fictional publications depicting Saiz\u014d as one of the legendary [[Sanada Ten Braves]].\n\n[[Uesugi Kenshin]], the famous ''daimy\u014d'' of [[Echigo Province]], was rumored to have been killed by a ninja. The legend credits his death to an assassin who is said to have hidden in Kenshin's lavatory, and fatally injured Kenshin by thrusting a blade or spear into his [[anus]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Nihon Hakugaku Kurabu|2006|p=36}}</ref> While historical records showed that Kenshin suffered abdominal problems, modern historians have generally attributed his death to [[stomach cancer]], [[esophageal cancer]] or [[cerebrovascular disease]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Nihon Hakugaku Kurabu|2004|pp=51\u201353}}; {{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=32}}</ref>\n\n===Psychological warfare===\nIn battle, the ninja were also used to cause confusion amongst the enemy.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 42\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=42}}</ref> A degree of [[psychological warfare]] in the capturing of enemy banners can be seen illustrated in the ''\u014cu Eikei Gunki'', composed between the 16th and 17th centuries:\n\n{{quote|Within Hataya castle there was a glorious ''shinobi'' whose skill was renowned, and one night he entered the enemy camp secretly.

The ''shinobi'' was considered a real profession, as demonstrated in the [[bakufu]]'s 1649 law on military service, which declared that only ''daimy\u014ds'' with an income of over 10,000 ''[[koku]]'' were allowed to retain ''shinobi''.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 13\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=13}}</ref> In the two centuries that followed, a number of ''ninjutsu'' manuals were written by descendants of Hattori Hanz\u014d as well as members of the Fujibayashi clan, an offshoot of the Hattori. Major examples include the ''[[Ninpiden]]'' (1655), the ''[[Bansenshukai]]'' (1675), and the ''[[Sh\u014dninki]]'' (1681).<ref name=\"Green 2001 358\" />\n\n[[Schools of Ninjutsu|Modern schools that claim to train ''ninjutsu'']] arose from the 1970s, including that of [[Masaaki Hatsumi]] ([[Bujinkan]]), [[Stephen K.

The lineage and authenticity of these schools are a matter of controversy.\n\n===Tactics===\nThe ninja did not always work alone. Teamwork techniques exist: For example, in order to scale a wall, a group of ninja may carry each other on their backs, or provide a human platform to assist an individual in reaching greater heights.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 22\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=22}}</ref> The ''Mikawa Go Fudoki'' gives an account where a coordinated team of attackers used [[password]]s to communicate.

Disguises as a ''[[komus\u014d]]'', a mendicant monk known for playing the ''[[shakuhachi]]'', were also effective, as the large \"basket\" hats traditionally worn by them concealed the head completely.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 18\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=18}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nNinja utilized a large variety of tools and weaponry, some of which were commonly known, but others were more specialized. Most were tools used in the infiltration of castles. A wide range of specialized equipment is described and illustrated in the 17th-century ''[[Bansenshukai]]'',<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 19\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=19}}</ref> including climbing equipment, extending spears,<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 48\" /> [[rocket]]-propelled arrows,<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 60\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=60}}</ref> and small collapsible boats.<ref name=\"draeger smith 1981 128\">{{Harvnb|Draeger|Smith|1981|p=128}}</ref>\n\n===Outerwear===\n[[File:Gappa travel cape and zunin with kusari armor.jpg|thumb|upright|Antique Japanese ''gappa'' (travel cape) and cloth ''zukin'' (hood) with ''kusari'' (chain armour) concealed underneath.]]\n\nWhile the image of a ninja clad in black garb (''[[shinobi sh\u014dzoku]]'') is prevalent in popular media, there is no written evidence for such attire.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 16\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=16}}</ref> Instead, it was much more common for the ninja to be disguised as civilians. The popular notion of black clothing is likely rooted in artistic convention; early drawings of ninja showed them dressed in black in order to portray a sense of invisibility.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 17\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=17}}; Turnbull uses the name ''Buke Meimokush\u014d'', an alternate reading for the same title. The ''Buke My\u014dmokush\u014d'' cited here is a much more common reading.</ref> This convention was an idea borrowed from the puppet handlers of ''[[bunraku]]'' theater, who dressed in total black in an effort to simulate [[Theatrical property|props]] moving independently of their controls.<ref name=\"Howell 1999 211\">{{Harvnb|Howell|1999|p=211}}</ref> Despite the lack of hard evidence, it has been put forward by some authorities that black robes, perhaps slightly tainted with red to hide bloodstains, was indeed the sensible garment of choice for infiltration.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 17\" />\n\nClothing used was similar to that of the [[samurai]], but loose garments (such as leggings) were tucked into trousers or secured with belts. The ''[[tenugui]]'', a piece of cloth also used in martial arts, had many functions. It could be used to cover the face, form a belt, or assist in climbing.\n\nThe historicity of armor specifically made for ninja cannot be ascertained. While pieces of light armor purportedly worn by ninja exist and date to the right time, there is no hard evidence of their use in ninja operations. Depictions of famous persons later deemed ninja often show them in [[Japanese armour|samurai armor]]. There were lightweight concealable types of armour made with [[Kusari (Japanese mail armour)|''kusari'']] (chain armour) and small armor plates such as [[Karuta (Japanese armour)|''karuta'']] that could have been worn by ninja including ''katabira'' (jackets) made with armour hidden between layers of cloth. Shin and arm guards, along with metal-reinforced hoods are also speculated to make up the ninja's armor.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 17\" />\n\n===Tools===\n[[File:Ninpiden kuroro kagi breaker.gif|thumb|left|180px|A page from the ''[[Ninpiden]]'', showing a tool for breaking locks.]]\nTools used for infiltration and espionage are some of the most abundant artifacts related to the ninja. Ropes and [[grappling hook]]s were common, and were tied to the belt.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 19\" /> A collapsible ladder is illustrated in the ''Bansenshukai'', featuring spikes at both ends to anchor the ladder.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 20\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=20}}</ref> Spiked or hooked climbing gear worn on the hands and feet also doubled as weapons.<ref name=\"Mol 2003 121\">{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=121}}</ref> Other implements include [[chisel]]s, [[hammer]]s, [[drill]]s, [[pickaxe|picks]] and so forth.\n\nThe ''[[kunai]]'' was a heavy pointed tool, possibly derived from the Japanese [[masonry]] [[trowel]], which it closely resembles. Although it is often portrayed in popular culture as a weapon, the ''kunai'' was primarily used for gouging holes in walls.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 61\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=61}}</ref> Knives and small saws (''hamagari'') were also used to create holes in buildings, where they served as a foothold or a passage of entry.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 20 21\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=20\u201321}}</ref> A portable listening device (''saoto hikigane'') was used to eavesdrop on conversations and detect sounds.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 21\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=21}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[mizugumo]]'' was a set of wooden shoes supposedly allowing the ninja to walk on water.<ref name=\"draeger smith 1981 128\" /> They were meant to work by distributing the wearer's weight over the shoes' wide bottom surface. The word ''mizugumo'' is derived from the native name for the [[Japanese water spider]] (''Argyroneta aquatica japonica''). The ''mizugumo'' was featured on the show ''[[MythBusters]]'', where it was demonstrated unfit for walking on water. The ''ukidari'', a similar footwear for walking on water, also existed in the form of a flat round [[bucket]], but was probably quite unstable.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 62\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=62}}</ref> Inflatable skins and breathing tubes allowed the ninja to stay underwater for longer periods of time.<ref name=\"ratti 1991 329\">{{Harvnb|Ratti|Westbrook|1991|p=329}}</ref>\n\nDespite the large array of tools available to the ninja, the ''Bansenshukai'' warns one not to be overburdened with equipment, stating \"a successful ninja is one who uses but one tool for multiple tasks\".<ref name=\"Green 2001 359\">{{Harvnb|Green|2001|p=359}}</ref>\n\n===Weaponry===\nAlthough shorter swords and daggers were used, the ''[[katana]]'' was probably the ninja's weapon of choice, and was sometimes carried on the back.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 18\" /> The katana had several uses beyond normal combat. In dark places, the scabbard could be extended out of the sword, and used as a long probing device.<ref name=\"Adams 1970 52\">{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=52}}</ref> The sword could also be laid against the wall, where the ninja could use the sword guard (''[[tsuba]]'') to gain a higher foothold.<ref name=\"Adams 1970 49\">{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=49}}</ref> The katana could even be used as a device to stun enemies before attacking them, by putting a combination of red pepper, dirt or dust, and iron filings into the area near the top of the scabbard, so that as the sword was drawn the concoction would fly into the enemy's eyes, stunning him until a lethal blow could be made. While straight swords were used before the invention of the katana,<ref name=\"Reed 1880 269 270\">{{Harvnb|Reed|1880|pp=269\u2013270}}</ref> the straight ''[[ninjat\u014d]]'' has no historical precedent and is likely a modern invention.\n\n[[File:Kusarigama-crop.jpg|thumb|A pair of ''[[kusarigama]]'', on display in [[Iwakuni Castle]]]]\n\nAn array of [[Dart (missile)|darts]], spikes, knives, and sharp, star-shaped discs were known collectively as ''[[shuriken]]''. While not exclusive to the ninja,<ref name=\"Mol 2003 119\">{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=119}}</ref> they were an important part of the arsenal, where they could be thrown in any direction.<ref name=\"ratti 1991 328 329\">{{Harvnb|Ratti|Westbrook|1991|pp=328\u2013329}}</ref> Bows were used for sharpshooting, and some ninjas' bows were intentionally made smaller than the traditional ''[[yumi]]'' (longbow).<ref name=\"ratti 1991 328\">{{Harvnb|Ratti|Westbrook|1991|p=328}}</ref> The chain and sickle (''[[kusarigama]]'') was also used by the ninja.<ref name=\"Adams 1970 55\">{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=55}}</ref> This weapon consisted of a weight on one end of a chain, and a sickle (''[[Kama (weapon)|kama]]'') on the other. The weight was swung to injure or disable an opponent, and the sickle used to kill at close range. \n\nExplosives introduced from [[China]] were known in Japan by the time of the [[Mongol Invasions of Japan|Mongol Invasions]] in the 13th century.<ref name=\"Bunch Hellemans2004 161\">{{Harvnb|Bunch|Hellemans|2004|p=161}}</ref> Later, explosives such as hand-held bombs and grenades were adopted by the ninja.<ref name=\"ratti 1991 329\" /> Soft-cased bombs were designed to release smoke or poison gas, along with fragmentation explosives packed with iron or ceramic [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 22\" />\n\nAlong with common weapons, a large assortment of miscellaneous arms were associated with the ninja. Some examples include poison,<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 19\" /> ''[[makibishi]]'' (caltrops),<ref name=\"Mol 2003 176\">{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=176}}</ref> cane swords (''[[shikomizue]]''),<ref name=\"Mol 2003 195\">{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=195}}</ref> land mines,<ref name=\"draeger smith 1981 127\">{{Harvnb|Draeger|Smith|1981|p=127}}</ref> ''[[fukiya]]'' (blowguns), poisoned darts, [[acid]]-spurting tubes, and firearms.<ref name=\"ratti 1991 329\" /> The ''happ\u014d'', a small eggshell filled with blinding powder (''[[metsubushi]]''), was also used to facilitate escape.<ref name=\"Mol 2003 124\">{{Harvnb|Mol|2003|p=124}}</ref>\n\n==Legendary abilities==\n[[Superhuman]] or [[supernatural]] powers were often associated with the ninja. Some legends include [[flight]], [[invisibility]], [[shapeshifting]], the ability to \"split\" into multiple bodies (''bunshin''), the summoning of animals (''kuchiyose''), and control over the [[Five elements (Japanese philosophy)|five classical elements]]. These fabulous notions have stemmed from popular imagination regarding the ninja's mysterious status, as well as romantic ideas found in later Japanese art of the [[Edo period]]. Magical powers were sometimes rooted in the ninja's own efforts to disseminate fanciful information. For example, Nakagawa Shoshujin, the 17th-century founder of Nakagawa-ry\u016b, claimed in his own writings (''Okufuji Monogatari'') that he had the ability to transform into birds and animals.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 13\" />\n\nPerceived control over the elements may be grounded in real tactics, which were categorized by association with forces of nature. For example, the practice of starting fires in order to cover a ninja's trail falls under ''katon-no-jutsu'' (\"fire techniques\").<ref name=\"Mol 2003 176\" />\n\n[[File:Actor-as-nikki-danjo-kunisada-1857.jpg|thumb|upright|Actor portraying Nikki Danj\u014d, a villain from the kabuki play ''Sendai Hagi''.

[[Kunisada]], 1857.]]\n\nThe ninja's adaption of [[kite]]s in espionage and warfare is another subject of legends. Accounts exist of ninja being lifted into the air by kites, where they flew over hostile terrain and descended into, or dropped bombs on enemy territory.<ref name=\"draeger smith 1981 128\" /> Kites were indeed used in Japanese warfare, but mostly for the purpose of sending messages and relaying signals.<ref name=\"Buckley 2002 257\">{{Harvnb|Buckley|2002|p=257}}</ref> Turnbull suggests that kites lifting a man into midair might have been technically feasible, but states that the use of kites to form a human \"[[Hang gliding|hang glider]]\" falls squarely in the realm of fantasy.<ref name=\"Turnbull 2003 22 23\">{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\n===Kuji-kiri===\n''[[Kuji-kiri]]'' is an esoteric practice which, when performed with an array of hand \"seals\" (''[[kuji-in]]''), was meant to allow the ninja to enact superhuman feats.\n\nThe ''kuji'' (\"nine characters\") is a concept originating from [[Daoism]], where it was a string of nine words used in charms and incantations.<ref name=\"Waterhouse 1996 2 3\">{{Harvnb|Waterhouse|1996|pp=2\u20133}}</ref> In [[China]], this tradition mixed with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] beliefs, assigning each of the nine words to a Buddhist deity.
