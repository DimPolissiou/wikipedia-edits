This initial success was followed by a series of commercial failures and repetitive roles, which garnered her negative reviews. The year 2004 marked a turning point for Kapoor when she played against [[typecasting (acting)|type]] in the role of a [[sex worker]] in the drama ''[[Chameli (film)|Chameli]]''. She subsequently earned critical recognition for her portrayal of a riot victim in the 2004 drama ''[[Dev (2004 film)|Dev]]'' and a character based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s heroine [[Desdemona]] in the 2006 crime film ''[[Omkara (2006 film)|Omkara]]''. Further praise came for her performances in the  romantic comedy ''[[Jab We Met]]'' (2007), the thrillers ''[[Kurbaan (2009 film)|Kurbaan]]'' (2009) and ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within]]'' (2012), and the dramas ''[[We Are Family (2010 film)|We Are Family]]'' (2010), ''[[Heroine (2012 film)|Heroine]]'' (2012), and ''[[Udta Punjab]]'' (2016). Her highest-grossing releases include the dramas ''[[3 Idiots]]'' (2009) and ''[[Bajrangi Bhaijaan]]'' (2015), the action films ''[[Bodyguard (2011 Hindi film)|Bodyguard]]'' (2011) and ''[[Singham Returns]]'' (2014), and the comedy ''[[Good Newwz]]'' (2019).\n\nMarried to actor [[Saif Ali Khan]], with whom she has a son, Kapoor's off-screen life is the subject of widespread coverage in India. She has a reputation for being outspoken and assertive, and is recognised for her contributions to the film industry through her fashion style and film roles. In addition to film acting, Kapoor participates in stage shows, hosts a radio show and has contributed as a co-writer to three books: an autobiographical memoir and two nutrition guides. She has started her own line of clothing and cosmetics for women, and has worked with [[UNICEF]] since 2014 to advocate for the [[Female education|education of girls]] and an increase in [[Education in India|quality based education in India]].\n\n==Early life and background==\n{{see also|Kapoor family}}\n[[File:Kapoor Women.jpg|thumb|alt=Kareena and Karisma Kapoor with their mother Babita|Pictured with mother [[Babita]] (left) and sister [[Karisma Kapoor|Karisma]].

This initial success was followed by a series of commercial failures and repetitive roles, which garnered her negative reviews. The year 2004 marked a turning point for Kapoor when she played against [[typecasting (acting)|type]] in the role of a [[sex worker]] in the drama ''[[Chameli (film)|Chameli]]''. She subsequently earned critical recognition for her portrayal of a riot victim in the 2004 drama ''[[Dev (2004 film)|Dev]]'' and a character based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s heroine [[Desdemona]] in the 2006 crime film ''[[Omkara (2006 film)|Omkara]]''. Further praise came for her performances in the  romantic comedy ''[[Jab We Met]]'' (2007), the thrillers ''[[Kurbaan (2009 film)|Kurbaan]]'' (2009) and ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within]]'' (2012), and the dramas ''[[We Are Family (2010 film)|We Are Family]]'' (2010), ''[[Heroine (2012 film)|Heroine]]'' (2012), and ''[[Udta Punjab]]'' (2016). Her highest-grossing releases include the dramas ''[[3 Idiots]]'' (2009) and ''[[Bajrangi Bhaijaan]]'' (2015), the action films ''[[Bodyguard (2011 Hindi film)|Bodyguard]]'' (2011) and ''[[Singham Returns]]'' (2014), and the comedy ''[[Good Newwz]]'' (2019).\n\nMarried to actor [[Saif Ali Khan]], with whom she has a son, Kapoor's off-screen life is the subject of widespread coverage in India. She has a reputation for being outspoken and assertive, and is recognised for her contributions to the film industry through her fashion style and film roles.

Subics P\u00e1l}}; c. 1245 \u2013 1 May 1312) was [[Ban of Croatia]] between 1275 and 1312, and [[List of rulers of Bosnia|Lord of Bosnia]] from 1299 to 1312. As the oldest son of Stephen II of the [[\u0160ubi\u0107 family|\u0160ubi\u0107]] noble family, he inherited the title of count of [[Bribir, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Bribir]]. He was appointed vice-ban in 1273, and ban in 1274. He was relieved from duty that year, following his involvement in disputes between Dalmatian coastal cities, and was returned to office in 1275.\n\nDuring the succession crisis of the 1290s, Paul emerged as one of the most powerful [[Oligarch (Kingdom of Hungary)|oligarchs]] in the realm, playing a crucial role in the ascension of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]] to the throne of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Croatia in union with Hungary|Croatia]]. He asserted sovereign rule over all of Croatia and Dalmatia, and took extensive campaigns and expanded his dominion eastward, over [[Banate of Bosnia|Bosnia]] and [[Zachlumia|Hum]], whose territories he distributed among his family members. He also warred against the [[Republic of Venice]], taking the Dalmatian capital of [[Zadar]]. The king's authority over the lands held by Paul was only nominal throughout the entirety of his rule.\n\nPaul managed to turn his titles into hereditary ones for his family. His main seats were in Bribir and the city of [[Skradin]]. He issued his own coin and arranged the establishment of three new Catholic dioceses in Croatia. Paul died shortly after the capture of Zadar in 1312, and was succeeded by his oldest son, [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Mladen II]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Bribir6 2.JPG|thumb|right|The seal of Paul, which reads \"Paul of Bribir, Ban of the Croats and Lord of Bosnia\".]]\nPaul was the eldest son of [[Stephen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Stephen II]], a member of the [[\u0160ubi\u0107 family]]. The exact date of his birth is unknown, the year is estimated around 1245. He had two brothers, [[Mladen I \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Mladen I]] and [[George I \u0160ubi\u0107|George I]].{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=10\u201311}} Of his sisters, the name of Stanislava is known.{{sfn|Toli\u0107|2016|p=126}}{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1897|p=43}}\n\nPaul inherited the title of count of [[Bribir, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Bribir]] from his father, who died before 1267.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=102}} The first mention of his name occurs in 1272, when he was the [[Podest\u00e0]] of the city of [[Trogir]]. In May 1273, Paul was Count of Trogir and [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. He was referred to as vice-ban of the Maritime regions in August. Through this duty, the influence of Paul and his brothers grew rapidly.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1989}} In 1274, he was elevated to the position of ban ({{lang-la|banus maritimus}}).{{sfn|Mikuli\u0107|2016|p=48}} His brother, George I, was Count of [[\u0160ibenik]].{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=102}}\n\n==Reign==\n===Consolidation of power===\n[[File:Utvrda Ostrovica (Croatia) - jug.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Ostrovica Fortress]] was one of Paul's seats]]\nPaul became involved in the longstanding dispute between Split and Trogir.{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1989}} The two cities were at war in the 1240s over lands in the hinterland of Split.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=150\u2013151}} Paul acted in favor of Split and tried to strengthen his rule over Trogir, which had mutinied against Paul. He ignored the warnings of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV]], who took Trogir under his protection. In the winter of 1273/1274, Split attacked the [[Fortress of Klis]], whose castellan was a supporter of Trogir. While the attack failed, Paul managed to subjugate Trogir in the spring of 1274.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=103}} He was also involved in the dispute between \u0160ibenik and Trogir over the Church of \u0160ibenik. Paul favored the position of \u0160ibenik, and pressed for the secession of its Church from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tragurium|Diocese of Trogir]]. He was then briefly removed from the position of ban in the 2nd half of 1274. He returned to the office in the summer of the following year.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nPaul's brother, Mladen I, succeeded him as Podest\u00e0 of Trogir,{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=12}} and was later Count of Trogir and Split.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2008|pp=46\u201347}} By 1278, the \u0160ubi\u0107s governed almost all coastal cities south of the [[Velebit]] Mountain. Among them was [[Skradin]] near \u0160ibenik.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=12}} Skradin was one of Paul's seats, along with Bribir, Klis, and the [[Ostrovica Fortress]].{{sfn|Toli\u0107|2016|p=126}}\n\nPaul sought to consolidate his control over the holdings of the [[Ka\u010di\u0107 family]], a pirate stronghold in southern Croatia centred around the city of [[Omi\u0161]]. The [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]] from the [[Kingdom of Naples]] was also active in suppressing the pirates from that area. During this period, the \u0160ubi\u0107 and the Anjou families established friendly relations.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2008|p=49}} The Angevins controlled Southern Italy, which was an important source of grain for Dalmatian coastal cities and the hinterland in late 13th century.{{sfn|Raukar|2003|pp=34\u201335}} The Angevin forces have taken the islands of Hvar and Bra\u010d from the Ka\u010di\u0107s in 1275. The [[Republic of Venice]] started its own war against the Ka\u010di\u0107s in 1276. By April 1278, the islands of Hvar and Bra\u010d recognized Venetian authority. This threatened Paul's interests and he intervened in the conflict against Venice. In the course of the war, Paul gained control of Omi\u0161 and the island of Bra\u010d, where he appointed a nobleman from [[Zadar]] to govern it. Paul's brother, George I, was appointed Count of Omi\u0161.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=13\u201314}} The Ka\u010di\u0107s were no longer in power, which eliminated the threat of pirates to Paul's ships in the Adriatic.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2008|p=49}}\n\nIn 1288, Paul started negotiating a peace with Venice. After long talks, a peace treaty was concluded in May 1290. Paul's representatives in the negotiations guaranteed that the pirates from Omi\u0161 would not attack Venetian ships and that they won't sail north of the [[Unije]]-[[Ancona]] line. The Venetian authority over the islands of Hvar and Bra\u010d was acknowledged. Also, the cities of Trogir, \u0160ibenik, and Split would pay 20,000 libras to Venice as a warranty. The Venetians guaranteed that they would not attack Paul's territories and gave his brother, George I, a free passage in his visits to the [[Papal States]] and in other trips. The peace treaty was broken in May 1293, when Venice captured Omi\u0161 with the help of a local noble. The conflict was renewed and lasted until March 1294 and a new peace treaty, signed under the same conditions as the first one, and Omi\u0161 returned to the \u0160ubi\u0107s.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n===Succession crisis===\n[[File:Oligarchs in the Kingdom of Hungary 14th century.svg|thumb|right|The dominion of Paul I \u0160ubi\u0107 among the other oligarchs during the Interregnum]]\n[[File:BreberiensesCoatofArms.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Coat of Arms of the [[\u0160ubi\u0107 family]]]]\nWith the death of King Ladislaus IV in 1290, who left no heirs, a war of succession broke out between [[Andrew III of Hungary|Andrew III]] of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]], supported by most of the Hungarian nobles, and [[Charles Martel of Anjou|Charles Martel]] of the House of Anjou, with the support of most of the Croatian nobility. Among them were the \u0160ubi\u0107, the [[Kurjakovi\u0107 family|Kurjakovi\u0107]], the [[Frankopan family|Frankopan]], and the [[Baboni\u0107 family|Baboni\u0107]] families, but their loyalty varied.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=207\u2013208}} Andrew III and Charles Martel competed with each other for the support of the nobility in Croatia and Slavonia.{{sfn|Kekez|2008|p=75}} In November 1291, the Angevins and Paul agreed on the import of grain from Apulia, sometimes free of taxes.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=104}}\n\nIn 1292, Charles Martel's father, [[Charles II of Naples|Charles II]], in the name of his son, awarded Paul and the \u0160ubi\u0107 family the hereditary rights to all of Croatia from the Gvozd Mountain to the [[Neretva]] River,{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=207\u2013208}} \"with all the barons, vassals, cities, castles, and villages, with adjacent islands and all the rights and appurtenances\", except for the westernmost part of Croatia, ruled by the Frankopans.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=104}} In 1293, Andrew III made a similar gesture by naming Paul the hereditary Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia. With this move, Andrew may have won Paul's support for a brief time.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=208}} Andrew III also asked Paul to recognize his mother, [[Tomasina Morosini]], as the [[Duke of Slavonia|Duchess of whole Slavonia]], a title that covered the entire territory from the [[Drava]] and [[Danube]] rivers to the Adriatic sea. This was not acceptable to Paul and he turned back to the Angevins.{{sfn|Mikuli\u0107|2016|pp=46\u201347}}{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=104}}\n\nThe sudden death of Charles Martel from the plague in 1295 hampered the ambitions of the Anjou family.

This led to a new revolt on behalf of Charles Robert.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=208}} The same year, Charles II confirmed all possessions of Paul and his brothers, both current and any in the future, on the condition that the \u0160ubi\u0107s provide troops for the Angevin campaigns. Previous grants were unconditioned, and Paul started distancing himself from the Angevins.{{sfn|Budak|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nPaul sent his brother, George I, to visit the Pope in Rome and the Anjou seat in Naples in January 1300. George convinced Charles II to press his grandson's claim to the throne and arrange Charles Robert's journey over the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the city of Split, where Paul would meet him. He also won Papal approval for one of the goals of the \u0160ubi\u0107 family, to remove the Church in \u0160ibenik from the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Trogir, and to create a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of \u0160ibenik|Diocese of \u0160ibenik]] directly under the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Split-Makarska|Archbishop of Split]]. George and Charles Robert arrived in Split in August. From there, Paul accompanied Charles to Zagreb, where loyal nobles recognized him as king. Of the lands and cities under the authority of Paul, only the city of Trogir, presumably due to the separation of the Diocese of \u0160ibenik, tried to challenge the recognition of Charles.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=208\u2013209}}{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nCharles's opponent, Andrew III, died in January 1301.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=208}} Charles hurried to [[Esztergom]], where he was crowned with a provisional crown in the spring of 1301.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=128}} Paul was not involved in Charles Robert's subsequent activities in Hungary, and focused on expanding his realm to the city of Zadar, then under Venetian rule, and the Banate of Bosnia.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=16}} Despite the coronation, Charles was not fully recognized for another 10 years, and ruled only some parts of Hungary, while his power in Croatia was only nominal. Paul rarely made a reference to the king in his charters, and was ''de facto'' an independent ruler within his realm.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=209\u2013210}} He and his family members did not attend Charles Robert's coronation in 1309, to which he sent his emissaries.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=105}}{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=16}}\n\n===Expansion===\n[[File:PSubicDomain.png|thumb|right|The dominion of Paul I \u0160ubi\u0107, with conquered territories in light]]\nIn 1299, Paul expanded his rule to the [[Banate of Bosnia]] and took the title of lord of Bosnia ({{lang-la|dominus Bosne}}). The main ally of Paul in Bosnia was Hrvatin Stjepani\u0107 of the [[Hrvatini\u0107]] family, with kinship ties to the \u0160ubi\u0107s, who ruled as Count of [[Donji Kraji]].{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=106}} Paul's rule was contested by [[Ban of Bosnia|Bosnian Ban]] [[Stephen I, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen I Kotromani\u0107]]. In the spring of 1302, Mladen I marched against Stephen, and by May he gained control of most of the banate up to the [[Drina]] River in the east. The offensive was over in June, when Mladen I, as the new ban of Bosnia, issued trading privileges to Split from [[Fo\u010da]], a town on the banks of the Drina.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nPaul also expanded to the southeast, on lands ruled by Serbian King [[Stefan Milutin]], in 1301. He took advantage of the civil war in [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] between Stefan Milutin and [[Stefan Dragutin]], and captured the entire region of [[Zachlumia|Hum]]. He then attacked the city of [[Kotor]], with the help of Venice, [[Dubrovnik]], and Zadar. The city held off the attack, which was the furthest point reached by Paul's armies. Peace negotiations between Paul and Stefan Milutin were planned in 1303, but it is not known whether the negotiations occurred and what was the outcome. Paul's eldest son, [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Mladen II]], was appointed Lord of Hum.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=106}}{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=17}}\n\nThe death of his brother Mladen I in June 1304, who had been reportedly murdered by the supporters of Stephen I Kotromani\u0107, described by the \u0160ubi\u0107s as heretics, compelled Paul to lead an army into Bosnia and reaffirm his authority. He re-established his rule by February 1305, and passed the title of ban to Mladen II.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=106}}{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=17}} Paul took the title of lord of all of Bosnia.{{sfn|An\u010di\u0107|1997|p=95}} Charles Robert granted Paul the hereditary right to the Banate of Bosnia in 1308.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=17}}\n\n===Last years===\n[[File:Money issued by Paul I \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir.jpg|thumb|right|Coins issued by Paul]] \nPaul preferred the title ban of the Croats ({{lang-la|banus Croatorum}}), instead of ban of Croatia or ban of the Maritime regions, suggesting that his power came from the people and the Croatian nobility rather than a higher authority. Paul's coat of arms was an eagle's wing on a shield. He kept a chancellery in both Skradin and Bribir. He issued his own coins, minted with silver from Bosnia,{{sfn|Budak|2017|pp=106\u2013107}} and modeled after the [[Venetian grosso]]. The coins bore the names of Mladen I and later Mladen II, the bans of Bosnia, and the name of Paul.{{sfn|Sulejmanagi\u0107|2014|p=53}}\n\nHe maintained good relations with the Pope and the Catholic Church.{{sfn|An\u010di\u0107|2002|p=103}} Along with the Diocese of \u0160ibenik, two new dioceses were established, one in [[Catholic Diocese of Duvno|Duvno]], and the other one in Omi\u0161. In Skradin, which became his main seat, the church of St. John the Baptist was built. Paul chose that saint as the protector of his family.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=107}} A [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] monastery of Saint Elizabeth, where his sister Stanislava served as part of the [[Poor Clares]] order, was also built in Skradin.{{sfn|Toli\u0107|2016|p=126}} In Bribir, the Franciscan church of St. Mary was built, which served as the funerary church of the \u0160ubi\u0107s.{{sfn|Laszlo Klemar|2016|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nThe \u0160ubi\u0107s made references to the earlier Croatian dukes and kings of the [[Domagojevi\u0107 dynasty|Domagojevi\u0107]] and [[Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty|Trpimirovi\u0107]] dynasties, in order to portray their rule as a continuity.{{sfn|Jak\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=122}}{{sfn|An\u010di\u0107|2002|pp=102\u2013103, 107\u2013108}}  This was particularly reflected in the invoking of King [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]], who ruled [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]] in the 2nd half of the 11th century. A chronicle from the early 14th century about Zvonimir, attributed to the \u0160ubi\u0107s, says that Zvonimir was burried in the same funerary church that was used by the \u0160ubi\u0107s. Before 1310, [[Pope Clement V]] declared Paul the patron and protector of the monastery of St. Gregory in [[Vrana (town)|Vrana]], which was donated by Zvonimir to [[Pope Gregory VII]].{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=105}} There are indications that Paul erected a memorial plaque in the church of St. Mary, in honor of Zvonimir.{{sfn|Laszlo Klemar|2016|p=97}} Stone inscriptions mentioning the 9th century Duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]] were restored and placed in newly constructed church buildings.{{sfn|An\u010di\u0107|2002|p=102}} \n\nAt the peak of his power, Paul turned his attention to the city of Zadar, the only Dalmatian coastal city that was not under his control. He maintained close connections with the nobility of Zadar, appointing them on various positions within his realm as a preliminary move to his expansion on the city. In 1310, Venice was at war with Ferrara and was faced with a failed attempt to overthrow the [[Doge of Venice]]. Paul assembled an army in the vicinity of Zadar during 1310, and remained stationary until an uprising against the Venetian authorities broke out in Zadar in March 1311. Paul's son, Mladen II, was at the head of the army sent to help the rebels, and the Venetians were forced to flee the city. Mladen II was proclaimed Count of Zadar and Prince of Dalmatia, as Zadar was considered the capital of Dalmatia. The Doge responded by sending a large fleet to recover the city. The forces under Mladen's command successfully repelled the attacks. Both Pope Clement V and King Charles Robert protested the attacks on Zadar, and Venice agreed on peace negotiations that began in April 1312. The negotiations were handled by the second son of Paul, [[George II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|George II]], and they dragged on after Paul's death. Paul died on 1 May and was buried in the church of St. Mary in Bribir. He was succeeded by his son, Mladen II.{{sfn|Budak|2017|pp=107\u2013108}}{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=18\u201319}}\n\n==Family==\nThe name of Paul's first wife is not known.

As the oldest son of Stephen II of the [[\u0160ubi\u0107 family|\u0160ubi\u0107]] noble family, he inherited the title of count of [[Bribir, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Bribir]]. He was appointed vice-ban in 1273, and ban in 1274. He was relieved from duty that year, following his involvement in disputes between Dalmatian coastal cities, and was returned to office in 1275.\n\nDuring the succession crisis of the 1290s, Paul emerged as one of the most powerful [[Oligarch (Kingdom of Hungary)|oligarchs]] in the realm, playing a crucial role in the ascension of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]] to the throne of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Croatia in union with Hungary|Croatia]]. He asserted sovereign rule over all of Croatia and Dalmatia, and took extensive campaigns and expanded his dominion eastward, over [[Banate of Bosnia|Bosnia]] and [[Zachlumia|Hum]], whose territories he distributed among his family members. He also warred against the [[Republic of Venice]], taking the Dalmatian capital of [[Zadar]]. The king's authority over the lands held by Paul was only nominal throughout the entirety of his rule.\n\nPaul managed to turn his titles into hereditary ones for his family. His main seats were in Bribir and the city of [[Skradin]]. He issued his own coin and arranged the establishment of three new Catholic dioceses in Croatia. Paul died shortly after the capture of Zadar in 1312, and was succeeded by his oldest son, [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Mladen II]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Bribir6 2.JPG|thumb|right|The seal of Paul, which reads \"Paul of Bribir, Ban of the Croats and Lord of Bosnia\".]]\nPaul was the eldest son of [[Stephen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Stephen II]], a member of the [[\u0160ubi\u0107 family]]. The exact date of his birth is unknown, the year is estimated around 1245. He had two brothers, [[Mladen I \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Mladen I]] and [[George I \u0160ubi\u0107|George I]].{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=10\u201311}} Of his sisters, the name of Stanislava is known.{{sfn|Toli\u0107|2016|p=126}}{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1897|p=43}}\n\nPaul inherited the title of count of [[Bribir, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Bribir]] from his father, who died before 1267.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=102}} The first mention of his name occurs in 1272, when he was the [[Podest\u00e0]] of the city of [[Trogir]]. In May 1273, Paul was Count of Trogir and [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. He was referred to as vice-ban of the Maritime regions in August. Through this duty, the influence of Paul and his brothers grew rapidly.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1989}} In 1274, he was elevated to the position of ban ({{lang-la|banus maritimus}}).{{sfn|Mikuli\u0107|2016|p=48}} His brother, George I, was Count of [[\u0160ibenik]].{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=102}}\n\n==Reign==\n===Consolidation of power===\n[[File:Utvrda Ostrovica (Croatia) - jug.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Ostrovica Fortress]] was one of Paul's seats]]\nPaul became involved in the longstanding dispute between Split and Trogir.{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1989}} The two cities were at war in the 1240s over lands in the hinterland of Split.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=150\u2013151}} Paul acted in favor of Split and tried to strengthen his rule over Trogir, which had mutinied against Paul. He ignored the warnings of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV]], who took Trogir under his protection. In the winter of 1273/1274, Split attacked the [[Fortress of Klis]], whose castellan was a supporter of Trogir. While the attack failed, Paul managed to subjugate Trogir in the spring of 1274.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=103}} He was also involved in the dispute between \u0160ibenik and Trogir over the Church of \u0160ibenik. Paul favored the position of \u0160ibenik, and pressed for the secession of its Church from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tragurium|Diocese of Trogir]]. He was then briefly removed from the position of ban in the 2nd half of 1274. He returned to the office in the summer of the following year.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nPaul's brother, Mladen I, succeeded him as Podest\u00e0 of Trogir,{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=12}} and was later Count of Trogir and Split.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2008|pp=46\u201347}} By 1278, the \u0160ubi\u0107s governed almost all coastal cities south of the [[Velebit]] Mountain. Among them was [[Skradin]] near \u0160ibenik.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=12}} Skradin was one of Paul's seats, along with Bribir, Klis, and the [[Ostrovica Fortress]].{{sfn|Toli\u0107|2016|p=126}}\n\nPaul sought to consolidate his control over the holdings of the [[Ka\u010di\u0107 family]], a pirate stronghold in southern Croatia centred around the city of [[Omi\u0161]]. The [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]] from the [[Kingdom of Naples]] was also active in suppressing the pirates from that area. During this period, the \u0160ubi\u0107 and the Anjou families established friendly relations.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2008|p=49}} The Angevins controlled Southern Italy, which was an important source of grain for Dalmatian coastal cities and the hinterland in late 13th century.{{sfn|Raukar|2003|pp=34\u201335}} The Angevin forces have taken the islands of Hvar and Bra\u010d from the Ka\u010di\u0107s in 1275. The [[Republic of Venice]] started its own war against the Ka\u010di\u0107s in 1276. By April 1278, the islands of Hvar and Bra\u010d recognized Venetian authority. This threatened Paul's interests and he intervened in the conflict against Venice. In the course of the war, Paul gained control of Omi\u0161 and the island of Bra\u010d, where he appointed a nobleman from [[Zadar]] to govern it. Paul's brother, George I, was appointed Count of Omi\u0161.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=13\u201314}} The Ka\u010di\u0107s were no longer in power, which eliminated the threat of pirates to Paul's ships in the Adriatic.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2008|p=49}}\n\nIn 1288, Paul started negotiating a peace with Venice. After long talks, a peace treaty was concluded in May 1290. Paul's representatives in the negotiations guaranteed that the pirates from Omi\u0161 would not attack Venetian ships and that they won't sail north of the [[Unije]]-[[Ancona]] line. The Venetian authority over the islands of Hvar and Bra\u010d was acknowledged. Also, the cities of Trogir, \u0160ibenik, and Split would pay 20,000 libras to Venice as a warranty. The Venetians guaranteed that they would not attack Paul's territories and gave his brother, George I, a free passage in his visits to the [[Papal States]] and in other trips. The peace treaty was broken in May 1293, when Venice captured Omi\u0161 with the help of a local noble. The conflict was renewed and lasted until March 1294 and a new peace treaty, signed under the same conditions as the first one, and Omi\u0161 returned to the \u0160ubi\u0107s.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n===Succession crisis===\n[[File:Oligarchs in the Kingdom of Hungary 14th century.svg|thumb|right|The dominion of Paul I \u0160ubi\u0107 among the other oligarchs during the Interregnum]]\n[[File:BreberiensesCoatofArms.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Coat of Arms of the [[\u0160ubi\u0107 family]]]]\nWith the death of King Ladislaus IV in 1290, who left no heirs, a war of succession broke out between [[Andrew III of Hungary|Andrew III]] of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]], supported by most of the Hungarian nobles, and [[Charles Martel of Anjou|Charles Martel]] of the House of Anjou, with the support of most of the Croatian nobility. Among them were the \u0160ubi\u0107, the [[Kurjakovi\u0107 family|Kurjakovi\u0107]], the [[Frankopan family|Frankopan]], and the [[Baboni\u0107 family|Baboni\u0107]] families, but their loyalty varied.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=207\u2013208}} Andrew III and Charles Martel competed with each other for the support of the nobility in Croatia and Slavonia.{{sfn|Kekez|2008|p=75}} In November 1291, the Angevins and Paul agreed on the import of grain from Apulia, sometimes free of taxes.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=104}}\n\nIn 1292, Charles Martel's father, [[Charles II of Naples|Charles II]], in the name of his son, awarded Paul and the \u0160ubi\u0107 family the hereditary rights to all of Croatia from the Gvozd Mountain to the [[Neretva]] River,{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=207\u2013208}} \"with all the barons, vassals, cities, castles, and villages, with adjacent islands and all the rights and appurtenances\", except for the westernmost part of Croatia, ruled by the Frankopans.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=104}} In 1293, Andrew III made a similar gesture by naming Paul the hereditary Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia. With this move, Andrew may have won Paul's support for a brief time.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=208}} Andrew III also asked Paul to recognize his mother, [[Tomasina Morosini]], as the [[Duke of Slavonia|Duchess of whole Slavonia]], a title that covered the entire territory from the [[Drava]] and [[Danube]] rivers to the Adriatic sea. This was not acceptable to Paul and he turned back to the Angevins.{{sfn|Mikuli\u0107|2016|pp=46\u201347}}{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=104}}\n\nThe sudden death of Charles Martel from the plague in 1295 hampered the ambitions of the Anjou family.

This led to a new revolt on behalf of Charles Robert.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=208}} The same year, Charles II confirmed all possessions of Paul and his brothers, both current and any in the future, on the condition that the \u0160ubi\u0107s provide troops for the Angevin campaigns. Previous grants were unconditioned, and Paul started distancing himself from the Angevins.{{sfn|Budak|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nPaul sent his brother, George I, to visit the Pope in Rome and the Anjou seat in Naples in January 1300. George convinced Charles II to press his grandson's claim to the throne and arrange Charles Robert's journey over the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the city of Split, where Paul would meet him. He also won Papal approval for one of the goals of the \u0160ubi\u0107 family, to remove the Church in \u0160ibenik from the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Trogir, and to create a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of \u0160ibenik|Diocese of \u0160ibenik]] directly under the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Split-Makarska|Archbishop of Split]]. George and Charles Robert arrived in Split in August. From there, Paul accompanied Charles to Zagreb, where loyal nobles recognized him as king. Of the lands and cities under the authority of Paul, only the city of Trogir, presumably due to the separation of the Diocese of \u0160ibenik, tried to challenge the recognition of Charles.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=208\u2013209}}{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nCharles's opponent, Andrew III, died in January 1301.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=208}} Charles hurried to [[Esztergom]], where he was crowned with a provisional crown in the spring of 1301.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=128}} Paul was not involved in Charles Robert's subsequent activities in Hungary, and focused on expanding his realm to the city of Zadar, then under Venetian rule, and the Banate of Bosnia.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=16}} Despite the coronation, Charles was not fully recognized for another 10 years, and ruled only some parts of Hungary, while his power in Croatia was only nominal. Paul rarely made a reference to the king in his charters, and was ''de facto'' an independent ruler within his realm.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=209\u2013210}} He and his family members did not attend Charles Robert's coronation in 1309, to which he sent his emissaries.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=105}}{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=16}}\n\n===Expansion===\n[[File:PSubicDomain.png|thumb|right|The dominion of Paul I \u0160ubi\u0107, with conquered territories in light]]\nIn 1299, Paul expanded his rule to the [[Banate of Bosnia]] and took the title of lord of Bosnia ({{lang-la|dominus Bosne}}). The main ally of Paul in Bosnia was Hrvatin Stjepani\u0107 of the [[Hrvatini\u0107]] family, with kinship ties to the \u0160ubi\u0107s, who ruled as Count of [[Donji Kraji]].{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=106}} Paul's rule was contested by [[Ban of Bosnia|Bosnian Ban]] [[Stephen I, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen I Kotromani\u0107]]. In the spring of 1302, Mladen I marched against Stephen, and by May he gained control of most of the banate up to the [[Drina]] River in the east. The offensive was over in June, when Mladen I, as the new ban of Bosnia, issued trading privileges to Split from [[Fo\u010da]], a town on the banks of the Drina.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nPaul also expanded to the southeast, on lands ruled by Serbian King [[Stefan Milutin]], in 1301. He took advantage of the civil war in [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] between Stefan Milutin and [[Stefan Dragutin]], and captured the entire region of [[Zachlumia|Hum]]. He then attacked the city of [[Kotor]], with the help of Venice, [[Dubrovnik]], and Zadar. The city held off the attack, which was the furthest point reached by Paul's armies. Peace negotiations between Paul and Stefan Milutin were planned in 1303, but it is not known whether the negotiations occurred and what was the outcome. Paul's eldest son, [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Mladen II]], was appointed Lord of Hum.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=106}}{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=17}}\n\nThe death of his brother Mladen I in June 1304, who had been reportedly murdered by the supporters of Stephen I Kotromani\u0107, described by the \u0160ubi\u0107s as heretics, compelled Paul to lead an army into Bosnia and reaffirm his authority. He re-established his rule by February 1305, and passed the title of ban to Mladen II.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=106}}{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=17}} Paul took the title of lord of all of Bosnia.{{sfn|An\u010di\u0107|1997|p=95}} Charles Robert granted Paul the hereditary right to the Banate of Bosnia in 1308.{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|p=17}}\n\n===Last years===\n[[File:Money issued by Paul I \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir.jpg|thumb|right|Coins issued by Paul]] \nPaul preferred the title ban of the Croats ({{lang-la|banus Croatorum}}), instead of ban of Croatia or ban of the Maritime regions, suggesting that his power came from the people and the Croatian nobility rather than a higher authority. Paul's coat of arms was an eagle's wing on a shield. He kept a chancellery in both Skradin and Bribir. He issued his own coins, minted with silver from Bosnia,{{sfn|Budak|2017|pp=106\u2013107}} and modeled after the [[Venetian grosso]]. The coins bore the names of Mladen I and later Mladen II, the bans of Bosnia, and the name of Paul.{{sfn|Sulejmanagi\u0107|2014|p=53}}\n\nHe maintained good relations with the Pope and the Catholic Church.{{sfn|An\u010di\u0107|2002|p=103}} Along with the Diocese of \u0160ibenik, two new dioceses were established, one in [[Catholic Diocese of Duvno|Duvno]], and the other one in Omi\u0161. In Skradin, which became his main seat, the church of St. John the Baptist was built. Paul chose that saint as the protector of his family.{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=107}} A [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] monastery of Saint Elizabeth, where his sister Stanislava served as part of the [[Poor Clares]] order, was also built in Skradin.{{sfn|Toli\u0107|2016|p=126}} In Bribir, the Franciscan church of St. Mary was built, which served as the funerary church of the \u0160ubi\u0107s.{{sfn|Laszlo Klemar|2016|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nThe \u0160ubi\u0107s made references to the earlier Croatian dukes and kings of the [[Domagojevi\u0107 dynasty|Domagojevi\u0107]] and [[Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty|Trpimirovi\u0107]] dynasties, in order to portray their rule as a continuity.{{sfn|Jak\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=122}}{{sfn|An\u010di\u0107|2002|pp=102\u2013103, 107\u2013108}}  This was particularly reflected in the invoking of King [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]], who ruled [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]] in the 2nd half of the 11th century. A chronicle from the early 14th century about Zvonimir, attributed to the \u0160ubi\u0107s, says that Zvonimir was burried in the same funerary church that was used by the \u0160ubi\u0107s. Before 1310, [[Pope Clement V]] declared Paul the patron and protector of the monastery of St. Gregory in [[Vrana (town)|Vrana]], which was donated by Zvonimir to [[Pope Gregory VII]].{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=105}} There are indications that Paul erected a memorial plaque in the church of St. Mary, in honor of Zvonimir.{{sfn|Laszlo Klemar|2016|p=97}} Stone inscriptions mentioning the 9th century Duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]] were restored and placed in newly constructed church buildings.{{sfn|An\u010di\u0107|2002|p=102}} \n\nAt the peak of his power, Paul turned his attention to the city of Zadar, the only Dalmatian coastal city that was not under his control. He maintained close connections with the nobility of Zadar, appointing them on various positions within his realm as a preliminary move to his expansion on the city. In 1310, Venice was at war with Ferrara and was faced with a failed attempt to overthrow the [[Doge of Venice]]. Paul assembled an army in the vicinity of Zadar during 1310, and remained stationary until an uprising against the Venetian authorities broke out in Zadar in March 1311. Paul's son, Mladen II, was at the head of the army sent to help the rebels, and the Venetians were forced to flee the city. Mladen II was proclaimed Count of Zadar and Prince of Dalmatia, as Zadar was considered the capital of Dalmatia. The Doge responded by sending a large fleet to recover the city. The forces under Mladen's command successfully repelled the attacks. Both Pope Clement V and King Charles Robert protested the attacks on Zadar, and Venice agreed on peace negotiations that began in April 1312. The negotiations were handled by the second son of Paul, [[George II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|George II]], and they dragged on after Paul's death. Paul died on 1 May and was buried in the church of St. Mary in Bribir. He was succeeded by his son, Mladen II.{{sfn|Budak|2017|pp=107\u2013108}}{{sfn|Karbi\u0107|2004|pp=18\u201319}}\n\n==Family==\nThe name of Paul's first wife is not known. Paul married his second wife, Ursa, in 1289.{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1897|p=61}} She was probably the sister of Hrvatin Stjepani\u0107,{{sfn|Budak|2017|p=106}}{{sfn|Kekez|2008|p=78}} or the daughter of Stefan Dragutin and [[Catherine of Hungary, Queen of Serbia|Catherine]] of the \u00c1rp\u00e1ds.{{sfn|An\u010di\u0107|2002|p=107}} Ursa died in 1303. In a chronicle about her death, she was referred to as the baness of the Croats.{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1897|p=79}} Paul's two brothers, Mladen I and George I, had a significant influence during his rule. Paul had four sons to whom he gave positions and holdings.{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1897|p=76}} His first son was Mladen II, who was Prince of Dalmatia, Count of Zadar, and Ban of Bosnia, and succeeded his father as Ban of Croatia and Lord of Bosnia.{{sfn|Klai\u0107|1897|pp=98, 179}} After his father's death, Mladen kept to himself the title of ban of Bosnia and lord of Hum, and only let his brother George II, the second son of Paul, to participate in the higher level of government. George II was the count of Dalmatian cities.

In the [[Helvetic Republic]], established 1798, it was divided between the two new cantons of [[Canton of Bellinzona|Bellinzona]] and [[Canton of Lugano|Lugano]]. The [[Act of Mediation|creation of the Swiss Confederation in 1803]] saw these two cantons combine to form the modern canton of Ticino.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Ticino'' was chosen for the newly established canton in 1803, after the [[Ticino river]] which flows through it from the [[Nufenen Pass|Novena Pass]] to [[Lake Maggiore]].<ref name=aet>{{cite web|title=Lo scorrere del fiume, l\u2019opera dell\u2019uomo|url=http://www.aet.ch/comunicati_det.html?idnews=7195|publisher=Azienda elettrica ticinese|accessdate=28 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028232235/http://www.aet.ch/comunicati_det.html?idnews=7195|archive-date=28 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nKnown as ''Ticinus'' in Roman times, the river appears on the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] as ''Ticenum''.

Around 1100 it was the centre of struggle between the free communes of [[Milan]] and [[Como]]: in the 14th century it was acquired by the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]], Dukes of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]]. In the fifteenth century the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Confederates conquered the valleys south of the Alps in three separate conquests.\n\nBetween 1403 and 1422 some of these lands were already annexed by forces from the [[canton of Uri]], but subsequently lost.

Subsequently, the upper valley of the river [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]], from the [[Saint-Gotthard Massif|St. Gotthard]] to the town of Biasca ([[Valle Leventina|Leventina Valley]]) was part of Uri. The remaining territory (''Baliaggi Ultramontani'', ''Ennetbergische Vogteien'', the Bailiwicks Beyond the Mountains) was administered by the Twelve Cantons.

Between 1798 and 1803, during the [[Helvetic Republic]], two cantons were created ([[Canton of Bellinzona|Bellinzona]] and [[Canton of Lugano|Lugano]]) but in 1803 the two were unified to form the canton of Ticino that joined the Swiss Confederation as a full member in the same year under the [[Act of Mediation]].<ref name=\"EB\"/> During the [[Napoleonic War]]s, many Ticinesi (as was the case for other [[Swiss people|Swiss]]) served in Swiss military units allied with the [[France|French]].

The northern, highest part, the [[Sopraceneri]], is formed by the two major Swiss valleys around [[Lake Maggiore]]: [[Ticino valley]] and [[Maggia valley]]. The southern part, the [[Sottoceneri]], is the region around [[Lake Lugano]].\n\nThe [[Ticino river]] is the largest river in the canton. It drains most of the canton, flowing from the northwest through the [[Bedretto valley]] and the [[Valle Leventina|Leventina]] valley to enter Lake Maggiore near [[Locarno]]. Its main tributaries are the [[Brenno]] in the [[Blenio valley]] and the [[Moesa River|Moesa]] in the [[Mesolcina]] valley in [[Graub\u00fcnden]]. The lands of most of the canton are shaped by the river, which in its mid portion forms a wide valley, commonly known as the ''Riviera''.\n\nThe western lands of the canton, however, are drained by the [[Maggia River]]. The [[Valle Verzasca]] is between the Ticino and the Maggia. There is also a smaller area that drains directly into the [[Lake Lugano]].

In the [[Helvetic Republic]], established 1798, it was divided between the two new cantons of [[Canton of Bellinzona|Bellinzona]] and [[Canton of Lugano|Lugano]]. The [[Act of Mediation|creation of the Swiss Confederation in 1803]] saw these two cantons combine to form the modern canton of Ticino.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Ticino'' was chosen for the newly established canton in 1803, after the [[Ticino river]] which flows through it from the [[Nufenen Pass|Novena Pass]] to [[Lake Maggiore]].<ref name=aet>{{cite web|title=Lo scorrere del fiume, l\u2019opera dell\u2019uomo|url=http://www.aet.ch/comunicati_det.html?idnews=7195|publisher=Azienda elettrica ticinese|accessdate=28 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028232235/http://www.aet.ch/comunicati_det.html?idnews=7195|archive-date=28 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nKnown as ''Ticinus'' in Roman times, the river appears on the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] as ''Ticenum''.

Later, probably around the rule of [[Augustus]], it became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. After the fall of the Western Empire, it was ruled by the [[Ostrogoths]], the [[Lombards]] and the [[Franks]]. Around 1100 it was the centre of struggle between the free communes of [[Milan]] and [[Como]]: in the 14th century it was acquired by the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]], Dukes of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]]. In the fifteenth century the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Confederates conquered the valleys south of the Alps in three separate conquests.\n\nBetween 1403 and 1422 some of these lands were already annexed by forces from the [[canton of Uri]], but subsequently lost. Uri conquered the [[Valle Leventina|Leventina Valley]] in 1440.<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia | title = Switzerland | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | volume = 26 | pages = 933\u20134 | year = 1911 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UoxAwrVzc88C&pg=PA933 | accessdate = 23 October 2008}}</ref> In a second conquest Uri, [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] and [[Canton of Nidwalden|Nidwalden]] gained the town of [[Bellinzona]] and the Riviera in 1500.<ref name=\"EB\"/> Some of the land and Bellinzona itself were previously annexed by [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] in 1419 but lost again in 1422. The third conquest was fought by troops from the entire Confederation (at that time constituted by 12 cantons). In 1512 [[Locarno]], the [[Maggia Valley]], [[Lugano]] and [[Mendrisio]] were annexed. Subsequently, the upper valley of the river [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]], from the [[Saint-Gotthard Massif|St. Gotthard]] to the town of Biasca ([[Valle Leventina|Leventina Valley]]) was part of Uri. The remaining territory (''Baliaggi Ultramontani'', ''Ennetbergische Vogteien'', the Bailiwicks Beyond the Mountains) was administered by the Twelve Cantons. These districts were governed by bailiffs holding office for two years and purchasing it from the members of the League.<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\n[[File:Ticino franco 1813 Cng641602.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Ticino franco|Ticinese franco]], currency of Ticino until the introduction of the [[Swiss franc]] in 1850.]]\n[[File:Verzasca Hut.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Stone house in [[Valle Verzasca]]]]\n\nThe lands of the canton of Ticino are the last lands to be conquered by the [[Swiss Confederation]]. The Confederation gave up any further conquests after their defeat at the [[battle of Marignano]] in 1515 by [[Francis I of France]]. The Val Leventina revolted unsuccessfully against [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] in 1755.<ref name=\"EB\"/> In February 1798 an attempt of annexation by the [[Cisalpine Republic]] was repelled by a volunteer militia in Lugano. Between 1798 and 1803, during the [[Helvetic Republic]], two cantons were created ([[Canton of Bellinzona|Bellinzona]] and [[Canton of Lugano|Lugano]]) but in 1803 the two were unified to form the canton of Ticino that joined the Swiss Confederation as a full member in the same year under the [[Act of Mediation]].<ref name=\"EB\"/> During the [[Napoleonic War]]s, many Ticinesi (as was the case for other [[Swiss people|Swiss]]) served in Swiss military units allied with the [[France|French]]. The canton minted its own [[currency]], the [[Ticinese franco]], between 1813 and 1850, when it began use of the [[Swiss franc]].\n\nIn the early 19th century, the contemporary Franco-Danish scholar [[Conrad Malte-Brun]] stated that: \"The canton of Tesino [Ticino] is the poorest, and the people the most ignorant of any in Switzerland.<ref>Malte-Brun, Conrad\n2015[1824] Universal Geography: or A Description of All Parts of the World, on a New Plan, According to the Great Natural Divisions of the globe; Accompanied with Analytical, Synoptical, and Elementary Tables.

The northern, highest part, the [[Sopraceneri]], is formed by the two major Swiss valleys around [[Lake Maggiore]]: [[Ticino valley]] and [[Maggia valley]]. The southern part, the [[Sottoceneri]], is the region around [[Lake Lugano]].\n\nThe [[Ticino river]] is the largest river in the canton. It drains most of the canton, flowing from the northwest through the [[Bedretto valley]] and the [[Valle Leventina|Leventina]] valley to enter Lake Maggiore near [[Locarno]]. Its main tributaries are the [[Brenno]] in the [[Blenio valley]] and the [[Moesa River|Moesa]] in the [[Mesolcina]] valley in [[Graub\u00fcnden]]. The lands of most of the canton are shaped by the river, which in its mid portion forms a wide valley, commonly known as the ''Riviera''.\n\nThe western lands of the canton, however, are drained by the [[Maggia River]]. The [[Valle Verzasca]] is between the Ticino and the Maggia. There is also a smaller area that drains directly into the [[Lake Lugano]]. Most of the land is considered within the [[Swiss Alps|Alps]] ([[Lepontine Alps]]), but a small area is part of the plain of the [[River Po]] which drains the north of [[Italy]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Ticino, while remaining [[alpine climate|alpine]], is noticeably milder than the rest of Switzerland's, enjoying a higher number of sunshine hours and generally warmer temperatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkingworld.com/home/index.asp?id=30&nid=289|title=Walkingworld \u2013 original article|website=Walkingworld.com|access-date=4 September 2019}}</ref> In German-speaking Switzerland, Ticino is nicknamed ''Sonnenstube'' (sun porch), owing to the more than 2,300 [[sunshine hours]] the canton receives every year, compared to 1,700 for Zurich.<ref name=\"SteinerKarnusian2014\">{{cite book|author1=J\u00fcrg Steiner|author2=Manuschak Karnusian|author3=Omar Gisler|title=MARCO POLO Reisef\u00fchrer Tessin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rn00AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA23|date=28 March 2014|publisher=Mair Dumont Marco Polo|isbn=978-3-8297-7172-6|page=23}}</ref>\n\n===Diocese===\nThe [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lugano]] is co-extensive to the canton.\n\n===Wine region===\n{{Main|Ticino (wine region)}}\nTicino is one of the wine regions for [[Swiss wine]].

In addition to the ''Such Sweet Thunder'' album, he promised the entire suite would be performed at the 1957 edition of the festival. Ellington and Strayhorn began building a home library of Shakespeare, seeking out Shakespeare experts, and reading through the canon during orchestra downtime.\n\nThe suite that would constitute ''Such Sweet Thunder'' was written in just under three weeks and recorded in early 1957. Although most of the compositions were created for the suite in conjunction with Strayhorn, a few were versions of older Strayhorn songs that were reworked and re-titled for the collection.<ref name=Cunniffe1>{{cite web |url=http://jazzhistoryonline.com/Such_Sweet_Thunder.html |title=Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn's \"Such Sweet Thunder\" |last=Cunniffe|first=Thomas |website=Jazz History Online |access-date=May 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n# \"Such Sweet Thunder\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Sonnet for Caesar\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 3:00\n# \"Sonnet to Hank Cinq\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 1:24\n# \"Lady Mac\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 3:41\n# \"Sonnet in Search of a Moor\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 2:22\n# \"The Telecasters\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 3:05\n# \"Up and Down, Up and Down (I Will Lead Them Up and Down)\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 3:09\n# \"Sonnet for Sister Kate\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 2:24\n# \"The Star-Crossed Lovers\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 4:00\n# \"Madness in Great Ones\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 3:26\n# \"Half the Fun\" (Also known as \"Lately\") (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 4:19\n# \"Circle of Fourths\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 1:45\n\n===Bonus tracks===\n<OL START=13>\n<LI>\"The Star-Crossed Lovers\" (Also known as \"Pretty Girl\") (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 4:15\n<LI>\"Circle of Fourths\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 1:47\n<LI>\"Suburban Beauty\" (Ellington) \u2013 2:56\n<LI>\"A-Flat Minor\" (Ellington) \u2013 2:33\n<LI>\"Caf\u00e9 au Lait\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 2:49\n<LI>\"Half the Fun\" ([[Take#Music|Alternate take]]) (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 4:08\n<LI>\"Suburban Beauty\" (Alternate take) (Ellington) \u2013 2:56\n<LI>\"A-Flat Minor\" ([[Outtake]]) (Ellington) \u2013 3:49\n<LI>\"Caf\u00e9 au Lait\"  (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 6:21\n<LI>\"Pretty Girl\" (Also known as the \"Star-Crossed Lovers\") (Outtake) (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 8:54\n</OL>\n\n==Production/reissue credits==\n\n===Musicians===\n* [[Jimmy Hamilton]] \u2013 Clarinet, Tenor Saxophone\n* [[Johnny Hodges]] \u2013 Alto Saxophone\n* [[Russell Procope]] \u2013 Clarinet, Alto Saxophone\n* [[Paul Gonsalves]] \u2013 Tenor Saxophone\n* [[Harry Carney]] \u2013 Bass Clarinet, Baritone Saxophone\n* [[Cat Anderson]] \u2013 Trumpet\n* [[Clark Terry]] \u2013 Trumpet\n* [[Ray Nance]] \u2013 Trumpet\n* [[Willie Cook]] \u2013 Trumpet\n* [[Quentin Jackson (trombonist)|Quentin Jackson]] \u2013 Trombone\n* [[John Sanders (trombonist)|John Sanders]] \u2013 Trombone\n* [[Britt Woodman]] \u2013 Trombone\n* [[Jimmy Woode]] \u2013 Bass\n* [[Duke Ellington]] \u2013 Piano\n* [[Sam Woodyard]] \u2013 Drums\n* [[Billy Strayhorn]] \u2013 Orchestration\n\n===Production===\n* [[Irving Townsend]] \u2013 Liner Notes, Original Recording Producer\n* [[Phil Schaap]] \u2013 Liner Notes, Reissue Producer, Remastering, Research, Restoration.

Ellington and Strayhorn began building a home library of Shakespeare, seeking out Shakespeare experts, and reading through the canon during orchestra downtime.\n\nThe suite that would constitute ''Such Sweet Thunder'' was written in just under three weeks and recorded in early 1957. Although most of the compositions were created for the suite in conjunction with Strayhorn, a few were versions of older Strayhorn songs that were reworked and re-titled for the collection.<ref name=Cunniffe1>{{cite web |url=http://jazzhistoryonline.com/Such_Sweet_Thunder.html |title=Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn's \"Such Sweet Thunder\" |last=Cunniffe|first=Thomas |website=Jazz History Online |access-date=May 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n# \"Such Sweet Thunder\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 3:22\n# \"Sonnet for Caesar\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 3:00\n# \"Sonnet to Hank Cinq\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 1:24\n# \"Lady Mac\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 3:41\n# \"Sonnet in Search of a Moor\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 2:22\n# \"The Telecasters\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 3:05\n# \"Up and Down, Up and Down (I Will Lead Them Up and Down)\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 3:09\n# \"Sonnet for Sister Kate\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 2:24\n# \"The Star-Crossed Lovers\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 4:00\n# \"Madness in Great Ones\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 3:26\n# \"Half the Fun\" (Also known as \"Lately\") (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 4:19\n# \"Circle of Fourths\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 1:45\n\n===Bonus tracks===\n<OL START=13>\n<LI>\"The Star-Crossed Lovers\" (Also known as \"Pretty Girl\") (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 4:15\n<LI>\"Circle of Fourths\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 1:47\n<LI>\"Suburban Beauty\" (Ellington) \u2013 2:56\n<LI>\"A-Flat Minor\" (Ellington) \u2013 2:33\n<LI>\"Caf\u00e9 au Lait\" (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 2:49\n<LI>\"Half the Fun\" ([[Take#Music|Alternate take]]) (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 4:08\n<LI>\"Suburban Beauty\" (Alternate take) (Ellington) \u2013 2:56\n<LI>\"A-Flat Minor\" ([[Outtake]]) (Ellington) \u2013 3:49\n<LI>\"Caf\u00e9 au Lait\"  (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 6:21\n<LI>\"Pretty Girl\" (Also known as the \"Star-Crossed Lovers\") (Outtake) (Ellington, Strayhorn) \u2013 8:54\n</OL>\n\n==Production/reissue credits==\n\n===Musicians===\n* [[Jimmy Hamilton]] \u2013 Clarinet, Tenor Saxophone\n* [[Johnny Hodges]] \u2013 Alto Saxophone\n* [[Russell Procope]] \u2013 Clarinet, Alto Saxophone\n* [[Paul Gonsalves]] \u2013 Tenor Saxophone\n* [[Harry Carney]] \u2013 Bass Clarinet, Baritone Saxophone\n* [[Cat Anderson]] \u2013 Trumpet\n* [[Clark Terry]] \u2013 Trumpet\n* [[Ray Nance]] \u2013 Trumpet\n* [[Willie Cook]] \u2013 Trumpet\n* [[Quentin Jackson (trombonist)|Quentin Jackson]] \u2013 Trombone\n* [[John Sanders (trombonist)|John Sanders]] \u2013 Trombone\n* [[Britt Woodman]] \u2013 Trombone\n* [[Jimmy Woode]] \u2013 Bass\n* [[Duke Ellington]] \u2013 Piano\n* [[Sam Woodyard]] \u2013 Drums\n* [[Billy Strayhorn]] \u2013 Orchestration\n\n===Production===\n* [[Irving Townsend]] \u2013 Liner Notes, Original Recording Producer\n* [[Phil Schaap]] \u2013 Liner Notes, Reissue Producer, Remastering, Research, Restoration.
