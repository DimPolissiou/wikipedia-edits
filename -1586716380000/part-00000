The practice of [[Designation (law)|designating a successor]] is intended to safeguard [[Continuity of government|continuity in the office of the president]] in the event the president along with the vice president and multiple other officials in the presidential line of succession died in a [[mass-casualty incident]]. The procedure originated in the 1950s during the [[Cold War]] with its risk of [[nuclear attack]].\n\nIf such an event occurred, the surviving official highest in the line of succession as delineated in the [[Presidential Succession Act of 1947]] would become [[acting president of the United States]]. Consequently, the individual named must be [[President of the United States#Eligibility|eligible to serve as president]]. In practice, the designated survivor is usually a member of the president's [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]], and is chosen by the president.\n\n==Selection==\nThe process for selection of the designated survivor has been described by those involved to be entirely random. However, the character of the event for which a designated survivor is being selected may cause some officials to be avoided in the selection process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/how-is-the-designated-survivor-chosen-rick-perry-wont-be-at-the-2019-sotu-15913072|title=How Is The Designated Survivor Chosen?

The practice of [[Designation (law)|designating a successor]] is intended to safeguard [[Continuity of government|continuity in the office of the president]] in the event the president along with the vice president and multiple other officials in the presidential line of succession died in a [[mass-casualty incident]]. The procedure originated in the 1950s during the [[Cold War]] with its risk of [[nuclear attack]].\n\nIf such an event occurred, the surviving official highest in the line of succession as delineated in the [[Presidential Succession Act of 1947]] would become [[acting president of the United States]]. Consequently, the individual named must be [[President of the United States#Eligibility|eligible to serve as president]]. In practice, the designated survivor is usually a member of the president's [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]], and is chosen by the president.\n\n==Selection==\nThe process for selection of the designated survivor has been described by those involved to be entirely random. However, the character of the event for which a designated survivor is being selected may cause some officials to be avoided in the selection process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/how-is-the-designated-survivor-chosen-rick-perry-wont-be-at-the-2019-sotu-15913072|title=How Is The Designated Survivor Chosen?

Soon the terror begins, with the house terrorizing its inhabitants (a la ''Amityville Horror'') with the elements that lie within the construction, for example; a possessed radio and a flying [[cleaver (knife)|cleaver]]. The priest's young son is possessed by the demons of Hell, and he enlists the aid of another, more experienced priest to help him perform an exorcism on the boy, in a sequence very similar to that in ''The Exorcist''. The spirit of a female serial killer also inhabits the house, an ugly baldheaded woman who was electrocuted by the state for murdering ten children and ingesting their souls inside herself.

By the 1970s, Gardner was a popular science writer and amateur mathematician. Rice said later<ref name=\":0\">{{citation|last=Cole|first=K.

This is an abstract subject with many scientific applications. In his writings, Gardner claimed that \"only certain types of pentagons could perfectly tile a plane or flat surface, and that all of them were known\u2014or so the mathematicians thought.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Tilings discoveries ===\nDespite having only a high-school education, Rice began devoting her free time to discovering new [[Pentagonal tiling#Monohedral convex pentagonal tilings|pentagonal tiling]]s, ways to tile a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] (a flat two-dimensional surface) using [[pentagon]]s (a five-sided shape). She worked on the problem in her free time and through the 1975 holiday season \"by drawing diagrams on the kitchen table when no one was around and hiding them when her husband and children came home, or when friends stopped by.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> She even developed her own system of [[Mathematical notation|notation]] to represent the constraints on and relationships between the sides and angles of the pentagons.\n\nIn February 1976, she mailed her discoveries to Gardner using her own home-made notation. He, in turn, sent Rice\u2019s work to [[Doris Schattschneider]], an expert in tiling patterns, who was skeptical at first, saying that Rice\u2019s peculiar notation system seemed odd, like \u201chieroglyphics.\u201d But with careful examination, she was able to validate Rice's results.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy October 1976, Rice had discovered 58 pentagon tilings (most of them previously unknown), which she arranged into 12 classes.
