Roger I of Sicily were attacking [[Amalfi]], which had revolted against Duke Roger, when bands of crusaders began to pass on their way through [[Italy]] to Constantinople. It is possible that Bohemond had religious reasons for joining the First Crusade. It is equally likely that he saw in the First Crusade the chance to gain a lordship in the Middle East.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Byzantium and the Crusader States, 1096-1204|last=Lilie|first=Ralph-Johannes|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=5}}</ref> Lilie details that Bohemond's \"father's second marriage deprived him of future prospects,\" in Norman Italy.

Another reason to suspect Bohemond's religious zeal is the supposed embassy Bohemond sent to [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], a powerful Crusade leader, asking him to join forces to sack Constantinople.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Armies of Heaven: The First Crusade and the Quest for Apocalypse|last=Rubenstein|first=Jay|publisher=Basic Books|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=71\u20132}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> While Godfrey declined his offer, taking Constantinople was never far from Bohemond's mind, as seen in his later attempt to take over the Byzantine Empire.\n\nHe gathered a [[The Armies of Bohemond of Taranto|Norman army]], which would have been one of the smaller crusade forces with 500 knights and about 2500-3500 infantry soldiers, alongside his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]'s force of 2000 men.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Norman Campaigns in the Balkans|last=Theotokis|first=Georgios|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|year=2014|isbn=|location=Suffolk, UK|pages=187}}</ref> What contributed to the Norman army's reputation as a great fighting force was their experience fighting in the East. Many Normans had been employed as mercenaries by the Byzantine Empire. Others like Bohemond had experience fighting the Byzantines and Muslim groups in the East fifteen years prior with Robert Guiscard.<ref name=\":2\" /> Bohemond crossed the [[Adriatic Sea]] to Constantinople along the route he had tried to follow in 1082\u20131084 when attacking the Byzantine Empire. He was careful to observe the correct attitude towards Alexios along this route, which was mainly keeping his soldiers from plundering Byzantine villages en route to Constantinople.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhen he arrived at Constantinople in April 1097, he took an oath of homage to Emperor Alexios, which he demanded from all crusade leaders.<ref name=\":2\" /> It's not clear what exact negotiations Bohemond and Alexios made concerning Bohemond governing part of the Eastern Byzantine Empire Alexios hoped the crusaders would reclaim. Alexios had no reason to trust Bohemond enough to give him a position at the time, but hinted that he could get a position by proving his loyalty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Armies of Heaven: The First Crusade and the Quest for Apocalypse|last=Rubenstein|first=Jay|publisher=Basic Books|year=2011|isbn=|location=NY|pages=96}}</ref> Bohemond's best chance at gaining a favorable position was to be loyal to Alexios, which he attempted to prove while the crusaders were camped around Constantinople.

Bohemond's reputation as an effective strategist and leader came from his fighting experience in the Balkans when he took charge of his father's army against Emperor Alexios (1082-1085).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Norman Campaigns in the Balkans: 1081-1108 AD|last=Theotokis|first=Georgios|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=167\u20138, 183}}</ref> There Bohemond became familiar with various Byzantine and Muslim strategies, including an encircling strategy used by Turkish forces at the siege of Nicaea. Mounted archers would encircle the crusader force, who would be unable to retaliate using close combat weaponry. Bohemond's familiarity with this Eastern strategy allowed him to adapt quickly leading to crusader victories through Antioch.\n\nThe Emperor's daughter, [[Anna Comnena]], leaves a portrait of him in her [[Alexiad]]. She met him for the first time when she was fourteen and was seemingly fascinated by him, leaving no similar portrait of any other Crusader prince. Of Bohemond, she wrote:\n<blockquote>Now the man was such as, to put it briefly, had never before been seen in the land of the Romans, be he either of the barbarians or of the Greeks (for he was a marvel for the eyes to behold, and his reputation was terrifying). Let me describe the barbarian's appearance more particularly \u2013 he was so tall in stature that he overtopped the tallest by nearly one cubit, narrow in the waist and loins, with broad shoulders and a deep chest and powerful arms. And in the whole build of the body he was neither too slender nor overweighted with flesh, but perfectly proportioned and, one might say, built in conformity with the canon of Polycleitus... His skin all over his body was very white, and in his face the white was tempered with red. His hair was yellowish, but did not hang down to his waist like that of the other barbarians; for the man was not inordinately vain of his hair, but had it cut short to the ears. Whether his beard was reddish, or any other colour I cannot say, for the razor had passed over it very closely and left a surface smoother than chalk... His blue eyes indicated both a high spirit and dignity; and his nose and nostrils breathed in the air freely; his chest corresponded to his nostrils and by his nostrils...the breadth of his chest. For by his nostrils nature had given free passage for the high spirit which bubbled up from his heart. A certain charm hung about this man but was partly marred by a general air of the horrible... He was so made in mind and body that both courage and passion reared their crests within him and both inclined to war. His wit was manifold and crafty and able to find a way of escape in every emergency. In conversation he was well informed, and the answers he gave were quite irrefutable. This man who was of such a size and such a character was inferior to the Emperor alone in fortune and eloquence and in other gifts of nature.<ref name=\"MR1977\">{{cite book|author=Various|title=The Portable Medieval Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SpDTnyGfwfkC&pg=PT211|date=26 May 1977|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-17374-9|page=211}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBohemond saw the opportunity to use the crusade for his own ends at the siege of Antioch. When his nephew Tancred  left the main army at [[Heraclea Cybistra]] and attempted to establish a footing in [[Cilicia]], the movement may have been already intended as a preparation for Bohemond's eastern principality. Bohemond was the first to take up a position before Antioch (October 1097) and he played a considerable part in the [[Siege of Antioch|siege]], in gathering supplies, beating off [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan|Radwan]] of [[Aleppo]]'s attempt to relieve the city from the east, and connecting the besiegers on the west with the [[Genoa|Genoese]] ships which lay in the port of St Simeon.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bohemund|volume=4|pages=135\u2013136|first=Ernest|last=Barker|authorlink=Ernest Barker}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=The Norman Campaigns in the Balkans|last=Theotokis|first=Georgios|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=192\u20133}}</ref> Due to his successful efforts Bohemond was seen as the actual leader of the siege of Antioch, rather than the elected leader [[Stephen, Count of Blois|Stephen of Blois]], who would soon leave the siege, claiming illness.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|Bohemond and his Norman troops scale the walls of Antioch, in an [[engraving]] by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\n\nBohemond was able to make a deal with [[Firouz]], one of the commanders of the city wall to end the siege of Antioch. However, he did not press to end the siege until May 1098 when learning of the approach of [[Kerbogha]] with a relief army to aid Antioch. He then proposed to the other crusade leaders that the leader to take Antioch should be put in charge of the city as Alexios' representative [[Tatikios|Tetigus]] had left in February 1098.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Armies of Heaven: The First Crusade and the Quest for Apocalypse|last=Rubenstein|first=Jay|publisher=Basic Books|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=169, 189}}</ref> Firouz led Bohemond's force up the walls of Antioch, allowing the Norman troops to infiltrate and ultimately capture the city.\n\nThe Crusaders' troubles were not over, however, as Kerbogha started his own siege on the newly crusader held Antioch. Bohemond was credited as the general and creator of the battle plan used to defeat Kerbogha by [[Raymond of Aguilers]]. Running very low on food and supplies Bohemond took the initiative in his strategy to leave the city and attack Kerbogha's forces, leading to a victory for the crusaders.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Norman Campaigns in the Balkans|last=Theotokis|first=Georgios|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=195\u20136}}</ref>\n\nBohemond then wanted to take control of Antioch for himself, but there were some problems he had to face first. [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond of Toulouse]], a prominent crusade leader, did not want to hand Antioch over to Bohemond. Raymond claimed that Bohemond and other leaders would be breaking their oath to Alexios, which was to give any conquered lands to the Byzantine Empire. Bohemond argued that because Alexios had failed to come to the crusader's aid at Antioch that the oath was no longer valid. Bohemond set himself up as the Prince of Antioch, and no Latin crusader or Byzantine force came to take it from him. Raymond of Toulouse decided to give up Antioch to Bohemond in January 1099, as the other crusaders moved south to the [[siege of Jerusalem (1099)|capture of Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"EB1911\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Byzantium and the Crusader States 1096-1204|last=Lilie|first=Ralph-Johannes|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=39\u201342}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Capture of Antioch by Bohemond of Tarente in June 1098.JPG|thumb|left|Capture of Antioch by Bohemond in June 1098, in a painting by [[Louis Gallait]], 1840]]\n\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem to the crusaders, Bohemond went to Jerusalem at [[Christmas]] 1099 to fulfill his crusade vows. While there he took part in the installation of [[Dagobert of Pisa]] as [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] of Jerusalem, perhaps in order to check the growth of Godfrey and his knights of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]]'s power in the city. By submitting to the patriarch Bohemond made connections to Jerusalem, who could be an ally against future attacks on Antioch, and to keep in the good graces of the Pope.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Byzantium and the Crusader States: 1096-1204|last=Lilie|first=Ralph-Johannes|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}</ref> While Bohemond had the fine territory, strategic position, and army necessary to found a principality in Antioch, he had to face two great forces\u2014the Byzantine Empire, which claimed the whole of his territories, and the strong Muslim principalities in the north-east of [[Syria]]. Against these two forces he would ultimately fail.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Wars between Antioch and the Byzantine Empire==\nBy 1100, the town of [[Malatia]], which guarded one of the [[Cilician Gates]] through the [[Taurus Mountains]], had been  captured by an [[Armenia]]n soldier of fortune.  He received reports that the [[Danishmend Gazi]] of [[Sivas]] was preparing an expedition to capture Malatia. The Armenians sought help from Bohemond.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAfraid to weaken his forces at Antioch, but not wishing to avoid the chance to extend his domain northwards, in August 1100 Bohemond marched north with only 300 knights and a small force of foot soldiers.  Failing to send scouting parties, they were ambushed by the Turks and completely encircled at the [[Battle of Melitene]].  Bohemond managed to send one soldier to seek help from [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Edessa]] but was captured. He was laden with chains and imprisoned in Neo-Caesarea (modern [[Niksar]]) until 1103.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nEmperor Alexios was incensed that Bohemond had broken his oath made in Constantinople and kept Antioch for himself. When he heard of Bohemond's capture, he offered to redeem the Norman commander for 260,000 dinars, if Danishmend Gazi would hand the prisoner over to Byzantium.  When [[Kilij Arslan I]], the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] overlord of Danishmend Gazi, heard of the proposed payment, he threatened to attack unless given half the ransom. Bohemond proposed instead a ransom of 130,000 dinars paid just to Danishmend Gazi. The bargain was concluded, and Gazi and Bohemond exchanged oaths of friendship. Ransomed by Baldwin of Edessa, he returned in triumph to Antioch in August 1103.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nHis nephew Tancred had taken his uncle's place for three years. During that time, he had attacked the Byzantines, and had added [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], [[Adana]] and [[Mopsuestia|Massissa]] in [[Cilicia]] to his uncle's territory; he was now deprived of his lordship by Bohemond's return. During the summer of 1103, the northern Franks attacked Ridwan of Aleppo to gain supplies and compelled him to pay tribute. Meanwhile, Raymond of Toulouse had established himself in [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]] with the aid of Alexios, and was able to check the expansion of Antioch to the south. Early in 1104, Baldwin and Bohemond passed Aleppo to move eastward and attack [[Harran]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nWhilst leading the campaign against Harran, Bohemond was defeated at Balak, near [[Raqqa]] on the [[Euphrates]] (see [[Battle of Harran]]). The defeat was decisive, making impossible the great eastern principality which Bohemond had contemplated. It was followed by a Greek attack on Cilicia and, despairing of his own resources, Bohemond returned to Europe for reinforcements in late 1104.<ref name=EB1911/> It is a matter of historical debate whether his \"crusade\" against the Byzantine empire was to gain the backing and indulgences of Pope [[Paschal II]]. Either way, he enthralled audiences across France with gifts of relics from the Holy Land and tales of heroism while fighting the infidel, gathering a large army in the process. [[Henry I of England]] famously prevented him from landing on English shores, since the king anticipated Bohemond's great attraction to the English nobility. His newfound status won him the hand of [[Constance of France, Princess of Antioch|Constance]], daughter of the French king, [[Philip I of France|Philip I]]. Of this marriage wrote [[Abbot Suger]]:\n<blockquote>Bohemond came to France to seek by any means he could gain the hand of the [[Louis VI of France|Lord Louis]]' sister Constance, a young lady of excellent breeding, elegant appearance and beautiful face. So great was the reputation for valour of the French kingdom and of the Lord Louis that even the Saracens were terrified by the prospect of that marriage. She was not engaged since she had broken off her agreement to wed [[Hugh, Count of Champagne|Hugh, count of Troyes]], and wished to avoid another unsuitable match. The prince of Antioch was experienced and rich both in gifts and promises; he fully deserved the marriage, which was celebrated with great pomp by the bishop of Chartres in the presence of the king, the Lord Louis, and many archbishops, bishops and noblemen of the realm.</blockquote>\n\nBohemond and Constance produced a son, [[Bohemond II of Antioch]].{{sfn|Luscombe, Riley-Smith|2004|p=760}}\n\n[[File:Canosa di Puglia BW 2016-10-14 11-12-35.jpg|thumb|200px|Mausoleum of Bohemond in [[Canosa di Puglia]]]]\nBohemond saw the root of his problems in Alexios and Constantinople when it came to preserving the Principality of Antioch. He thought that defending Antioch against Alexios would not be enough, since he was greatly outnumbered by the Byzantine army. Instead, Bohemond decided to go on the offensive and attack the Byzantine Empire at its core in Constantinople.\n\nBohemond was then resolved to use his newly recruited army of 34,000 men not to defend Antioch against the Greeks, but to attack Alexios.<ref name=\"Treadgold626\">W. Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'',  626</ref> Bohemond took a similar route that was successful for his father in Illyria and Greece. Alexios, aided by the [[republic of Venice|Venetians]], proved to be much stronger than when he faced Bohemond and Robert Guiscard in 1082\u20131084. Alexios was used to Norman battle tactics and their strength, and decided on a war of attrition rather than face them head on. While the Normans [[Siege of Dyrrhachium (1107\u20131108)|laid siege]] to Dyrrhachium, Alexios blockaded the Norman camp until Bohemond was forced to negotiate.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Norman Campaigns in the Balkans: 1081-1108|last=Theotokis|first=Georgios|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=206\u20137;212\u201313}}</ref>\n\nBohemond had to submit to a humiliating peace, all his ambitions destroyed.

Roger I of Sicily were attacking [[Amalfi]], which had revolted against Duke Roger, when bands of crusaders began to pass on their way through [[Italy]] to Constantinople.

Bohemond's reputation as an effective strategist and leader came from his fighting experience in the Balkans when he took charge of his father's army against Emperor Alexios (1082-1085).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Norman Campaigns in the Balkans: 1081-1108 AD|last=Theotokis|first=Georgios|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=167\u20138, 183}}</ref> There Bohemond became familiar with various Byzantine and Muslim strategies, including an encircling strategy used by Turkish forces at the siege of Nicaea. Mounted archers would encircle the crusader force, who would be unable to retaliate using close combat weaponry. Bohemond's familiarity with this Eastern strategy allowed him to adapt quickly leading to crusader victories through Antioch.\n\nThe Emperor's daughter, [[Anna Comnena]], leaves a portrait of him in her [[Alexiad]]. She met him for the first time when she was fourteen and was seemingly fascinated by him, leaving no similar portrait of any other Crusader prince. Of Bohemond, she wrote:\n<blockquote>Now the man was such as, to put it briefly, had never before been seen in the land of the Romans, be he either of the barbarians or of the Greeks (for he was a marvel for the eyes to behold, and his reputation was terrifying). Let me describe the barbarian's appearance more particularly \u2013 he was so tall in stature that he overtopped the tallest by nearly one cubit, narrow in the waist and loins, with broad shoulders and a deep chest and powerful arms. And in the whole build of the body he was neither too slender nor overweighted with flesh, but perfectly proportioned and, one might say, built in conformity with the canon of Polycleitus... His skin all over his body was very white, and in his face the white was tempered with red. His hair was yellowish, but did not hang down to his waist like that of the other barbarians; for the man was not inordinately vain of his hair, but had it cut short to the ears. Whether his beard was reddish, or any other colour I cannot say, for the razor had passed over it very closely and left a surface smoother than chalk... His blue eyes indicated both a high spirit and dignity; and his nose and nostrils breathed in the air freely; his chest corresponded to his nostrils and by his nostrils...the breadth of his chest. For by his nostrils nature had given free passage for the high spirit which bubbled up from his heart. A certain charm hung about this man but was partly marred by a general air of the horrible... He was so made in mind and body that both courage and passion reared their crests within him and both inclined to war. His wit was manifold and crafty and able to find a way of escape in every emergency. In conversation he was well informed, and the answers he gave were quite irrefutable. This man who was of such a size and such a character was inferior to the Emperor alone in fortune and eloquence and in other gifts of nature.<ref name=\"MR1977\">{{cite book|author=Various|title=The Portable Medieval Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SpDTnyGfwfkC&pg=PT211|date=26 May 1977|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-17374-9|page=211}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBohemond saw the opportunity to use the crusade for his own ends at the siege of Antioch. When his nephew Tancred  left the main army at [[Heraclea Cybistra]] and attempted to establish a footing in [[Cilicia]], the movement may have been already intended as a preparation for Bohemond's eastern principality. Bohemond was the first to take up a position before Antioch (October 1097) and he played a considerable part in the [[Siege of Antioch|siege]], in gathering supplies, beating off [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan|Radwan]] of [[Aleppo]]'s attempt to relieve the city from the east, and connecting the besiegers on the west with the [[Genoa|Genoese]] ships which lay in the port of St Simeon.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bohemund|volume=4|pages=135\u2013136|first=Ernest|last=Barker|authorlink=Ernest Barker}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=The Norman Campaigns in the Balkans|last=Theotokis|first=Georgios|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=192\u20133}}</ref> Due to his successful efforts Bohemond was seen as the actual leader of the siege of Antioch, rather than the elected leader [[Stephen, Count of Blois|Stephen of Blois]], who would soon leave the siege, claiming illness.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|Bohemond and his Norman troops scale the walls of Antioch, in an [[engraving]] by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\n\nBohemond was able to make a deal with [[Firouz]], one of the commanders of the city wall to end the siege of Antioch. However, he did not press to end the siege until May 1098 when learning of the approach of [[Kerbogha]] with a relief army to aid Antioch. He then proposed to the other crusade leaders that the leader to take Antioch should be put in charge of the city as Alexios' representative [[Tatikios|Tetigus]] had left in February 1098.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Armies of Heaven: The First Crusade and the Quest for Apocalypse|last=Rubenstein|first=Jay|publisher=Basic Books|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=169, 189}}</ref> Firouz led Bohemond's force up the walls of Antioch, allowing the Norman troops to infiltrate and ultimately capture the city.\n\nThe Crusaders' troubles were not over, however, as Kerbogha started his own siege on the newly crusader held Antioch. Bohemond was credited as the general and creator of the battle plan used to defeat Kerbogha by [[Raymond of Aguilers]]. Running very low on food and supplies Bohemond took the initiative in his strategy to leave the city and attack Kerbogha's forces, leading to a victory for the crusaders.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Norman Campaigns in the Balkans|last=Theotokis|first=Georgios|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=195\u20136}}</ref>\n\nBohemond then wanted to take control of Antioch for himself, but there were some problems he had to face first. [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond of Toulouse]], a prominent crusade leader, did not want to hand Antioch over to Bohemond. Raymond claimed that Bohemond and other leaders would be breaking their oath to Alexios, which was to give any conquered lands to the Byzantine Empire. Bohemond argued that because Alexios had failed to come to the crusader's aid at Antioch that the oath was no longer valid. Bohemond set himself up as the Prince of Antioch, and no Latin crusader or Byzantine force came to take it from him. Raymond of Toulouse decided to give up Antioch to Bohemond in January 1099, as the other crusaders moved south to the [[siege of Jerusalem (1099)|capture of Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"EB1911\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Byzantium and the Crusader States 1096-1204|last=Lilie|first=Ralph-Johannes|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=39\u201342}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Capture of Antioch by Bohemond of Tarente in June 1098.JPG|thumb|left|Capture of Antioch by Bohemond in June 1098, in a painting by [[Louis Gallait]], 1840]]\n\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem to the crusaders, Bohemond went to Jerusalem at [[Christmas]] 1099 to fulfill his crusade vows. While there he took part in the installation of [[Dagobert of Pisa]] as [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] of Jerusalem, perhaps in order to check the growth of Godfrey and his knights of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]]'s power in the city. By submitting to the patriarch Bohemond made connections to Jerusalem, who could be an ally against future attacks on Antioch, and to keep in the good graces of the Pope.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Byzantium and the Crusader States: 1096-1204|last=Lilie|first=Ralph-Johannes|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}</ref> While Bohemond had the fine territory, strategic position, and army necessary to found a principality in Antioch, he had to face two great forces\u2014the Byzantine Empire, which claimed the whole of his territories, and the strong Muslim principalities in the north-east of [[Syria]]. Against these two forces he would ultimately fail.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Wars between Antioch and the Byzantine Empire==\nBy 1100, the town of [[Malatia]], which guarded one of the [[Cilician Gates]] through the [[Taurus Mountains]], had been  captured by an [[Armenia]]n soldier of fortune.  He received reports that the [[Danishmend Gazi]] of [[Sivas]] was preparing an expedition to capture Malatia. The Armenians sought help from Bohemond.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAfraid to weaken his forces at Antioch, but not wishing to avoid the chance to extend his domain northwards, in August 1100 Bohemond marched north with only 300 knights and a small force of foot soldiers.  Failing to send scouting parties, they were ambushed by the Turks and completely encircled at the [[Battle of Melitene]].  Bohemond managed to send one soldier to seek help from [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Edessa]] but was captured. He was laden with chains and imprisoned in Neo-Caesarea (modern [[Niksar]]) until 1103.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nEmperor Alexios was incensed that Bohemond had broken his oath made in Constantinople and kept Antioch for himself. When he heard of Bohemond's capture, he offered to redeem the Norman commander for 260,000 dinars, if Danishmend Gazi would hand the prisoner over to Byzantium.  When [[Kilij Arslan I]], the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] overlord of Danishmend Gazi, heard of the proposed payment, he threatened to attack unless given half the ransom. Bohemond proposed instead a ransom of 130,000 dinars paid just to Danishmend Gazi. The bargain was concluded, and Gazi and Bohemond exchanged oaths of friendship. Ransomed by Baldwin of Edessa, he returned in triumph to Antioch in August 1103.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nHis nephew Tancred had taken his uncle's place for three years. During that time, he had attacked the Byzantines, and had added [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], [[Adana]] and [[Mopsuestia|Massissa]] in [[Cilicia]] to his uncle's territory; he was now deprived of his lordship by Bohemond's return. During the summer of 1103, the northern Franks attacked Ridwan of Aleppo to gain supplies and compelled him to pay tribute. Meanwhile, Raymond of Toulouse had established himself in [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]] with the aid of Alexios, and was able to check the expansion of Antioch to the south. Early in 1104, Baldwin and Bohemond passed Aleppo to move eastward and attack [[Harran]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nWhilst leading the campaign against Harran, Bohemond was defeated at Balak, near [[Raqqa]] on the [[Euphrates]] (see [[Battle of Harran]]). The defeat was decisive, making impossible the great eastern principality which Bohemond had contemplated. It was followed by a Greek attack on Cilicia and, despairing of his own resources, Bohemond returned to Europe for reinforcements in late 1104.<ref name=EB1911/> It is a matter of historical debate whether his \"crusade\" against the Byzantine empire was to gain the backing and indulgences of Pope [[Paschal II]]. Either way, he enthralled audiences across France with gifts of relics from the Holy Land and tales of heroism while fighting the infidel, gathering a large army in the process. [[Henry I of England]] famously prevented him from landing on English shores, since the king anticipated Bohemond's great attraction to the English nobility. His newfound status won him the hand of [[Constance of France, Princess of Antioch|Constance]], daughter of the French king, [[Philip I of France|Philip I]]. Of this marriage wrote [[Abbot Suger]]:\n<blockquote>Bohemond came to France to seek by any means he could gain the hand of the [[Louis VI of France|Lord Louis]]' sister Constance, a young lady of excellent breeding, elegant appearance and beautiful face. So great was the reputation for valour of the French kingdom and of the Lord Louis that even the Saracens were terrified by the prospect of that marriage. She was not engaged since she had broken off her agreement to wed [[Hugh, Count of Champagne|Hugh, count of Troyes]], and wished to avoid another unsuitable match. The prince of Antioch was experienced and rich both in gifts and promises; he fully deserved the marriage, which was celebrated with great pomp by the bishop of Chartres in the presence of the king, the Lord Louis, and many archbishops, bishops and noblemen of the realm.</blockquote>\n\nBohemond and Constance produced a son, [[Bohemond II of Antioch]].{{sfn|Luscombe, Riley-Smith|2004|p=760}}\n\n[[File:Canosa di Puglia BW 2016-10-14 11-12-35.jpg|thumb|200px|Mausoleum of Bohemond in [[Canosa di Puglia]]]]\nBohemond saw the root of his problems in Alexios and Constantinople when it came to preserving the Principality of Antioch. He thought that defending Antioch against Alexios would not be enough, since he was greatly outnumbered by the Byzantine army. Instead, Bohemond decided to go on the offensive and attack the Byzantine Empire at its core in Constantinople.\n\nBohemond was then resolved to use his newly recruited army of 34,000 men not to defend Antioch against the Greeks, but to attack Alexios.<ref name=\"Treadgold626\">W. Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'',  626</ref> Bohemond took a similar route that was successful for his father in Illyria and Greece. Alexios, aided by the [[republic of Venice|Venetians]], proved to be much stronger than when he faced Bohemond and Robert Guiscard in 1082\u20131084. Alexios was used to Norman battle tactics and their strength, and decided on a war of attrition rather than face them head on. While the Normans [[Siege of Dyrrhachium (1107\u20131108)|laid siege]] to Dyrrhachium, Alexios blockaded the Norman camp until Bohemond was forced to negotiate.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Norman Campaigns in the Balkans: 1081-1108|last=Theotokis|first=Georgios|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=206\u20137;212\u201313}}</ref>\n\nBohemond had to submit to a humiliating peace, all his ambitions destroyed. Under the [[Treaty of Devol]] in 1108, he became the vassal of Alexios with the title of ''[[sebastos]]'', consented to receive Alexios' pay, and promised to cede [[disputed territories]] and to admit a Greek patriarch into Antioch. Henceforth, Bohemond was a broken man. He died six months later without returning to Antioch.<ref>[[Albert of Aix]] records his death at [[Bari]] (Albericus Aquensis II.XI, p. 177).</ref> With one last jab at Alexios, by not returning to Antioch the Treaty of Devol became null and void as it only applied to Bohemond himself.

With the win, Oakland entered its bye week at 3\u20132.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/chicago-bears-at-oakland-raiders/game-center/sp-id-10401000002142151??ocid=ocid=INSSPBD10 |title=Chicago Bears @ Oakland Raiders - Sunday, October 6, 2019 - NFL Game Center - MSN Sports |website=MSN.com |access-date=October 11, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/06/raiders-make-a-statement-beat-bears-in-london/ |title=Raiders make a statement, beat Bears in London |last=Smith |first=Michael David |date=October 6, 2019 |website=ProFootballTalk |access-date=October 11, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n====Week 7: at Green Bay Packers====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Oakland Raiders|year=2019|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 7: Oakland Raiders at Green Bay Packers&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=October 20\n|time=12:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT/10:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT\n|road=Raiders\n|R1=3|R2=7|R3=7|R4=7\n|home='''Packers'''\n|H1=7|H2=14|H3=14|H4=7\n|stadium=[[Lambeau Field]], [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]\n|attendance=78,160\n|weather=Sunny, {{convert|55|F|C}}\n|referee=[[Alex Kemp (American football official)|Alex Kemp]]\n|TV=CBS\n|TVAnnouncers=Jim Nantz, Tony Romo and Tracy Wolfson\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019102004/2019/REG7/raiders@packers Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/57997/GB_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*OAK \u2013 [[Daniel Carlson (American football)|Daniel Carlson]] 45-yard field goal, 12:25.

Magnetic Video licensed 50 films from 20th Century Fox, including ''The Sound of Music'' and ''Patton'', through Twentieth Century Fox Telecommunications. The films were released under the Magnetic Video banner on video cassette tapes and sold via a back page ad in [[TV Guide]].<ref name=\"mpn\">{{cite news|url=https://www.mediaplaynews.com/fox-history/|title=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment: A History of Distinction|last=Arnold|first=Thomas K.|date=April 21, 2019|work=Media Play News|access-date=June 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBlay sold Magnetic Video to 20th Century Fox in 1977 becoming the first studio home video division. Blay continued on as the subsidiary's president and CEO. Directly with [[Plitt Theatres]] chain in early 1980, they launched a pilot theater lobbies program. Through a distributor, a similar program was set up with [[United Artists Theaters]].<ref name=\"mpn\"/>\n\nIn March 1982, Magnetic Video changed its name to 20th Century-Fox Video, Inc. while continued to be headquartered in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]]. However, Blay was forced out at the time, with Telecommunications division president and CEO Steve Roberts took charge of 2CF Videos.<ref name=\"mpn\"/>\n\nRoberts oversaw in June 1982 the merger of 20th Century-Fox Video operations and CBS Video Enterprises and continued as the joint venture president. He was replaced as [[CBS/Fox Video]] president in January 1983 by a former [[Columbia Pictures]] executive, Larry Hilford. Hilford was verbal critic of the video rental business, but with the studio looking at a likely loss, he attempted to make the out of the results. CBS/Fox and other home video units increased prices of the cassettes by around 67% to maximize income. They also move to encourage customer purchasing instead of renting. As a part of that CBS/Fox looked to existing retail chains for direct sales. [[Toys R Us]] and [[Child World]] signed the first direct deals in July 1985 with CBS/Fox. Walt Disney Home Video soon followed with a direct deal with Toys R Us.<ref name=\"mpn\"/>\n\nby 1991, 20th Century Fox had put the CBS-Fox joint venture on the back burner and began releasing videocassette under the Fox Video. Fox Video was under president Bob DeLellis, a 1984 hire at CBS/Fox and rose to group vice president and president in 1991. With expected repeat viewing, Fox Video dropped prices on family films starting in June 1991 with ''''[[Home Alone]]'''' at a suggested list price of $24.98 to encourage purchasing over rental.<ref name=\"mpn\"/>\n\nFox Filmed Entertainment had a new chief operating officer and president [[Bill Mechanic]] in 1993 coming from Disney Home Video. Mechanic had plans to move Fox forward including Fox Video, but initial left DeLellis alone as he was setting up multiple creative divisions within Fox. Mechanic had been the one to install the \"Vault\" moratorium strategy at Disney. ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' was released soon after Mechanic's arrival with a sell through price and surpassed sale projections at 10 million tapes.<ref name=\"mpn\"/>\n\n===Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment===\nThe company was renamed Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment (also called Fox Home Entertainment) on March 16, 1995<ref>{{cite web |title=Amended Statement by Foreign Corporation, FoxVideo, Inc. |url=https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=00937208-6107852 |website=Business Search |publisher=Califorina Secretary of State |accessdate=June 17, 2019}}</ref> with the addition to Fox Video of distribution operations, three other labels (Fox Kids Networks, [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS Videos]], CBS/Fox Videos) and two new media units, Fox Interactive, Magnet Interactive Studios. Total revenue for the expanded business unit would have been over $800 million with Fox Videos providing the bulk at $650 million. Mechanic kept DeLellis as president of the expanded unit's North American operation with Jeff Yap as international president. By May 1995, Fox had Magnet under a worldwide label deal for 10 to 12 title through 1996.

Four months for ''New Hope'' and until the fall of 1997 for ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi''. Sales topped 30 million copies over expectations. The company's 1996 release of ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' sold 18 million-unit making the industry's bestselling live-action home video release.<ref name=\"mpn\"/>\n\nWith the May 1997 departure of DeLellis, a quick rotation of presidents lead Fox Home Entertainment, Yapp for four months then an interim president Pat Wyatt, head of Twentieth Century Fox Licensing & Merchandising, in September 1997. With DVD being a Warner Home Video property, the company did not initial issue DVDs instead advocated for digital VHS tapes then the disposable Divx. Divx was DVD variant that had limited viewing time launched by Circuit City consumer electronics chain in June 1998. With DVD's low cost at $20 and Divx at $4.50, the DVD format won quickly out over Divx. News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch wanted a deal with Time Warner cable for the soon to launch [[Fox News]] and a lower dial position for [[Fox Family Channel]], Mechanic adopted the DVD format to smooth the deal.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nBy 1998, Wyatt became permanent president of Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment. Wyatt then became head of Fox Consumer Product, which put together the video and licensing unit. Wyatt had to drop the licensing half as the home video unit boomed. DVD sales were so strong that they factored into green-lighting theatrical films.<ref name=\"mpn\" />\n\nWyatt reorganized the Fox Home Entertainment through a partnership with replicator Cinram and lead the way in using data mining to increase its retail business partner's margins. Being ahead of the other studios, TCFHE began picking up additional outside labels as distribution clients with their fees covering the company's overhead.

He was replaced as [[CBS/Fox Video]] president in January 1983 by a former [[Columbia Pictures]] executive, Larry Hilford. Hilford was verbal critic of the video rental business, but with the studio looking at a likely loss, he attempted to make the out of the results. CBS/Fox and other home video units increased prices of the cassettes by around 67% to maximize income. They also move to encourage customer purchasing instead of renting. As a part of that CBS/Fox looked to existing retail chains for direct sales. [[Toys R Us]] and [[Child World]] signed the first direct deals in July 1985 with CBS/Fox. Walt Disney Home Video soon followed with a direct deal with Toys R Us.<ref name=\"mpn\"/>\n\nby 1991, 20th Century Fox had put the CBS-Fox joint venture on the back burner and began releasing videocassette under the Fox Video.

{"title_page": "Gail Borden Public Library District", "text_new": "'''Gail Borden Public Library''' is a [[public library]] district located in [[Elgin, Illinois]]. District boundaries include the city and villages of Elgin, [[South Elgin]], [[Bartlett, Illinois|Bartlett]], [[Streamwood, Illinois|Streamwood]], and [[Hoffman Estates, Illinois|Hoffman Estates]].  The library is a member of [[Reaching Across Illinois Library System]], one of two multitype regional library systems in [[Illinois]].\n\n==History==\nThe library was named in honor of [[Gail Borden]] (November 9, 1801 &ndash; January 11, 1874), who in 1856 invented [[condensed milk]].  Gail Borden never lived in Elgin or donated any funds for the library which bears his name, but in 1892, his step sons, Samuel and Alfred Church, residents of Elgin, purchased and donated the Scofield Mansion at 50 N. Spring Street to house the new library.  Their only request was that the library be forever and always known and called the Gail Borden Public Library.\n\nThe library remained at the 50 Spring Street location until the late 1960s when the weight of the books was beginning to strain the ability of the building to hold them all.  A new library was built at the Corner of Kimball and Grove, and the library was moved. In 1975/76, the children's department was renovated.  Renovations included a climbing play structure with a slide and windows to peek from, an aquarium and a mini zoo with lizards and other interesting creatures.  Led by the Children's Librarian, Mary Greenawalt, this was one of the first libraries to incorporate play structures into the library experience.  The population began to overwhelm the library resources leading to plans for the new building, which opened in 2003.\n\n==The library today==\nIn October 2003, the library moved into a new {{convert|153826|sqft|m2}} facility just across the street from the old library at a cost of $29.8 million.<ref>https://gailborden.info/about-the-library</ref> The new library is situated along the eastern shore of the Fox River and includes a shelving capacity of 460,000 volumes.  The architects, Frye Gillan Molinaro Architects, Ltd, designed the library to accommodate the expected growth in population from 110,000 in 2004 to 165,000 over the next 20 years.  The library, a two-story structure is clad in warm buff and terra cotta-colored stone and inspired by the late 19th and early 20th century architectural [[Prairie School]] style, illustrated by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and others.\n\nIn 2009, the Gail Borden Public Library District received the [[National Medal for Museum and Library Service]].  This is the highest honor awarded for libraries and museums recognizing their service and contributions within their community.\n\nFor the first time in its 135 year history, the Gail Borden Public Library District opened its first branch.  The Rakow Branch Library opened its doors on August 15, 2009.<ref>https://gailborden.info/about-the-library/rakow-branch/rakow-branch-history</ref>  Designed by architectural firm Engberg Anderson Design Partnership, the building features a popular materials collection, a computer cafe, a zen garden and natural prairie plantings as well as a living room area with fireplace.  The building earned gold LEED certification  (Leadership in Environmental Energy and Design) due to the numerous environmentally friendly and sustainable features including a geothermal well system for heating and cooling the facility.\n\nOn July 24, 2016, the long awaited South Elgin Branch was added to the Gail Borden Library District, expanding it to a total of three buildings.  The building was donated by the Hoffer Foundation, and part of the constructions costs were offset with money provided by South Elgin.  The branch is a 4,275 sq foot building, located at 127 S.

Their only request was that the library be forever and always known and called the Gail Borden Public Library.\n\nThe library remained at the 50 Spring Street location until the late 1960s when the weight of the books was beginning to strain the ability of the building to hold them all.  A new library was built at the Corner of Kimball and Grove, and the library was moved. In 1975/76, the children's department was renovated.  Renovations included a climbing play structure with a slide and windows to peek from, an aquarium and a mini zoo with lizards and other interesting creatures.  Led by the Children's Librarian, Mary Greenawalt, this was one of the first libraries to incorporate play structures into the library experience.  The population began to overwhelm the library resources leading to plans for the new building, which opened in 2003.\n\n==The library today==\nIn October 2003, the library moved into a new {{convert|153826|sqft|m2}} facility just across the street from the old library at a cost of $29.8 million.<ref>https://gailborden.info/about-the-library</ref> The new library is situated along the eastern shore of the Fox River and includes a shelving capacity of 460,000 volumes.  The architects, Frye Gillan Molinaro Architects, Ltd, designed the library to accommodate the expected growth in population from 110,000 in 2004 to 165,000 over the next 20 years.  The library, a two-story structure is clad in warm buff and terra cotta-colored stone and inspired by the late 19th and early 20th century architectural [[Prairie School]] style, illustrated by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and others.\n\nIn 2009, the Gail Borden Public Library District received the [[National Medal for Museum and Library Service]].  This is the highest honor awarded for libraries and museums recognizing their service and contributions within their community.\n\nFor the first time in its 135 year history, the Gail Borden Public Library District opened its first branch.  The Rakow Branch Library opened its doors on August 15, 2009.<ref>https://gailborden.info/about-the-library/rakow-branch/rakow-branch-history</ref>  Designed by architectural firm Engberg Anderson Design Partnership, the building features a popular materials collection, a computer cafe, a zen garden and natural prairie plantings as well as a living room area with fireplace.  The building earned gold LEED certification  (Leadership in Environmental Energy and Design) due to the numerous environmentally friendly and sustainable features including a geothermal well system for heating and cooling the facility.\n\nOn July 24, 2016, the long awaited South Elgin Branch was added to the Gail Borden Library District, expanding it to a total of three buildings.  The building was donated by the Hoffer Foundation, and part of the constructions costs were offset with money provided by South Elgin.  The branch is a 4,275 sq foot building, located at 127 S. McLean Blvd in South Elgin, IL.<ref>https://www.gailborden.info/southelgininfo</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://www.railslibraries.info Reaching Across Illinois Library System (RAILS)]\n*[http://gailborden.info/about-the-library/district-boundaries Gail Borden Public Library : District boundaries]\n*[http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/pdf_publications/lda214.pdf Illinois Library Systems]\n*[http://gailborden.info/about-the-library/history-of-the-library Gail Borden Public Library : History of the library]\n*[http://www.fgmarch.com Frye Gillan Molinaro Architects, Ltd]\n*[http://www.gailborden.info/about-the-library/main-library Gail Borden Public Library : Building Information]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gailborden.info/ Gail Borden Public Library], official website\n*[http://search.gailborden.info Gail Borden Public Library catalog]\n*[http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/gailbord003 Digital collection about the Gail Borden Public Library]\n\n{{coords|42|2|33.0|N|88|17|17.2|W|region:US-IL_scale:50000|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Library districts in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Public libraries in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Elgin, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Bartlett, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Streamwood, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Hoffman Estates, Illinois]]\n[[Category:South Elgin, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Education in Kane County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Kane County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Library buildings completed in 2003]] nahhhh\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Borden_Public_Library_District"}

The [[Ovary (plants)|ovary]] has two to six [[carpel]]s, [[Locule|unilocular]] and [[superior ovary|superior]]. The [[Style (botany)|style]] is short and thick; the [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] is [[Glossary of botanical terms#apical|apical]] and [[Glossary of botanical terms#capitate|capitate]], with two to six lobes. [[Placentation#Placentation in plants|Placentation]] is parietal. [[Ovule]]s number from two to many in one or two rows on each of the two to six placentas; they are hemianatropous to campylotropous, bitegmic, and crassinucellate.\n* The [[fruit]] is a [[berry (botany)|berry]] with a persistent [[calyx (botany)|calyx]], with two or more [[seed]]s. ''[[Cinnamosma macrocarpa]]'', in the [[Madagascar|Madagascan]] genus ''Cinnamosma'', has the largest fruit in the family, sometimes reaching {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|9|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n* [[Seed]]s have [[Glossary of botanical terms#exotesta|exotestae]] (the outer layer of the testa) only; the [[Glossary of botanical terms#tegmen|tegmen]] (the inner layer of the testa) is collapsed. The seed coat has oily [[idioblast]]s; the [[endosperm]] is abundant and oily ([[Glossary of botanical terms#ruminate|ruminate]] in ''Cinnamosma''). The [[Embryo#Plant embryos|embryo]] is small and straight to slightly curved, with two [[cotyledon]]s.\n* [[Pollen]] occurs in [[Glossary of botanical terms#monad|monads]], and is delicate and monosulcate (usually with 10% of the grain trichotomosulcate); apertures are distal, [[exine]], generally tectate, and granular, intectate, and reticulate in ''[[Cinnamosma]]''; grains are small and hardly ornamented in ''[[Cinnamodendron]]'' and ''[[Warburgia]]'', largest and most highly decorated in ''[[Canella]]'' and ''[[Pleodendron]]''. The pollen is generally similar to that of the [[Myristicaceae]], which had at one time caused some [[plant systematics|systematists]] to believe the two families were closely related.\n* The [[Chromosome| chromosome number]] ''2n'' is 22, 26, or 28.<ref name=\"ehrendorfer2000\">Friedrich Ehrendorfer and Maria Lambrou. 2000. \"Chromosomes of ''Takhtajania'', other Winteraceae, and Canellaceae: phylogenetic implications\".

The very large stamen numbers (20 to 40), are probably counts of thecae or microsporangia.\n\n== Ecology ==\nCanellaceae has species in both [[xeric]] and [[Hydric soil|wet forests]].\n\nIn ''[[Canella winterana]]'', the flowers are [[protogynous]]. The berries are usually red, and probably eaten by birds, which contribute to [[seed dispersal]] ([[ornithochory]]). The trees are attacked by [[larvae]] of different [[insects]], including [[dipteran]]s.\n\n== Phytochemistry ==\n[[File:Canella winterana Guadeloupe2.JPG|thumb | right | Fruit of ''Canella winterana'', at [[Pointe des Ch\u00e2teaux (Guadeloupe)|Pointe des Ch\u00e2teaux]], [[Guadeloupe]], October 2008]]\n[[File:Canella winteriana Guadeloupe.JPG|thumb|right | Flowers of ''C. winterana'', at Pointe des Ch\u00e2teaux, Guadeloupe, October 2008]]\n\n[[Monoterpene]]s are common, as are [[drimane]]-type [[sesquiterpene]]s, including [[cinnafragrin]]s, [[cinnamodial]], and [[capsicodendrin]].

Canellaceae also have [[alkaloid]]s of the [[aporphine]] type, such as [[N-(cinnamoil)-tryptamine]], [[lignan]]s of the aryl-tetralin type, [[cinnamaldehyde]]s, and [[allylphenol]]s. Crystals of [[calcium oxalate]] are in the leaf mesophyll. Most species are [[cyanogenetic]]. [[Protocyanidin]]s, [[flavonol]]s, [[saponin]]s, [[sapogenin]]s, and [[ellagic acid]] are absent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n== Uses ==\nThe saro, or green sandalwood, (also known locally as ''mandravasarotra''), ''[[Cinnamosma fragrans]]'', is native to Madagascar and is exported from there to India to be burned in ceremonies.

The [[xylem]] has narrow [[xylem ray|rays]]. The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] is [[Essential oil|aromatic]], with  prominent and unusual appearing [[lenticel]]s.\n* The [[Leaf|leaves]] have a [[Black pepper|pepper]]y [[taste]], are [[Alternate leaf|alternate]], spiral, or [[Phyllotaxis|distichous]] in arrangement, simple, entire, [[Glossary of botanical terms#coriaceous|coriaceous]], [[Petiole (botany)|petiolate]], [[pinnate]]ly [[Leaf#Venation (arrangement of the veins)|nerved]], without [[stipule]]s, with translucent ([[Glossary of botanical terms#pellucid|pellucid]]) [[Gland (botany)|glands]]. The [[parenchyma]] is without [[Palisade cell|palisade layer]] in ''[[Pleodendron]]'' and ''[[Canella]]''. The [[Stoma (botany)|stomata]] are [[Glossary of botanical terms#paracytic|paracytic]] in [[Americas|American]] genera, and [[Glossary of botanical terms#anomocytic|anomocytic]] in the [[Old World]].\n* The [[inflorescence]]s are terminal or [[axil]]lary, in a [[panicle]] (''Canella'') or a [[raceme]]; otherwise, the flowers are solitary (by reduction) and axillary.\n* The [[flower]]s are [[Floral symmetry|actinomorphic]], [[hypogynous]], and usually [[Glossary of botanical terms#trimerous|trimerous]].

[[Stamen]]s number 6-12, apparently derived from the [[Connation|fusion]] of two whorls in ''[[Warburgia]]'' and ''Canella''. [[Anther]]s are [[Dehiscence (botany)|extrorse]] and [[Theca|bithecal]], with two [[sporangia]] per theca, attached to the outside of the [[androphore|staminal tube]], and [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]]; [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]] is by a longitudinal slit, [[Glossary of botanical terms#connective|connective]] not projecting beyond thecae or only slightly so.\n* The [[gynoecium]] is [[carpel|syncarpous]].

The berries are usually red, and probably eaten by birds, which contribute to [[seed dispersal]] ([[ornithochory]]). The trees are attacked by [[larvae]] of different [[insects]], including [[dipteran]]s.\n\n== Phytochemistry ==\n[[File:Canella winterana Guadeloupe2.JPG|thumb | right | Fruit of ''Canella winterana'', at [[Pointe des Ch\u00e2teaux (Guadeloupe)|Pointe des Ch\u00e2teaux]], [[Guadeloupe]], October 2008]]\n[[File:Canella winteriana Guadeloupe.JPG|thumb|right | Flowers of ''C. winterana'', at Pointe des Ch\u00e2teaux, Guadeloupe, October 2008]]\n\n[[Monoterpene]]s are common, as are [[drimane]]-type [[sesquiterpene]]s, including [[cinnafragrin]]s, [[cinnamodial]], and [[capsicodendrin]]. These three sesquiterpenes are shared with only the [[Winteraceae]] in [[angiosperms]]. Canellaceae also have [[alkaloid]]s of the [[aporphine]] type, such as [[N-(cinnamoil)-tryptamine]], [[lignan]]s of the aryl-tetralin type, [[cinnamaldehyde]]s, and [[allylphenol]]s. Crystals of [[calcium oxalate]] are in the leaf mesophyll. Most species are [[cyanogenetic]]. [[Protocyanidin]]s, [[flavonol]]s, [[saponin]]s, [[sapogenin]]s, and [[ellagic acid]] are absent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n== Uses ==\nThe saro, or green sandalwood, (also known locally as ''mandravasarotra''), ''[[Cinnamosma fragrans]]'', is native to Madagascar and is exported from there to India to be burned in ceremonies. It is not related to the true [[Santalum|sandalwoods]], which are in the family [[Santalaceae]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nMost species of Canellaceae produce bark that is similar in [[odor]] and [[flavor]] to [[cinnamon]], but they are not related to true [[Cinnamomum|cinnamons]], which are in the family [[Lauraceae]].\n\nThe white cinnamon, ''[[Canella winterana]]'', a native of [[Florida]] and the [[Antilles]], is used as a [[condiment]], with [[Herbal tonic|tonic]] properties.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nCommercial production of \"white cinnamon\" from ''C. winterana'' has ceased,<ref name=\"zanoni2004\">Thomas A.

The Canellaceae have long had local use as aromatic plants and as herbal medicines.\n\nThe bark of the red cinnamon or false Winter's bark, ''[[Cinnamodendron corticosum]]'', is used as a substitute for Winter's bark (''[[Drimys winteri]]'', a member of [[Winteraceae]]) in [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]], where it is called ''canelo'', a name that is also applied to cinnamon. In [[Africa]], several species of ''[[Warburgia]]'' have [[Medicinal plants|medicinal]] uses.
