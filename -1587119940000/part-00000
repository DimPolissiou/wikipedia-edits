According to Byzantine sources, the Muslims planned to launch their attack on a feast day. The local Byzantine [[Vicarius]] learned of their plans and collected the garrisons of the fortresses. Seeing the great number of the enemy forces, the Muslims withdrew to the south where the fighting started at the village of Mu'ta and they were routed.{{sfn|Buhl|1993|p=756-757}}{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=67}} According to Muslim sources, after three of their leaders were killed, the command was given to [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] and he succeeded in saving the rest of the force.{{sfn|Buhl|1993|p=756-757}}\n\n==Background==\nThe Byzantines were reoccupying territory following the peace accord between Emperor [[Heraclius]] and the [[Shahrbaraz|Sasanid general Shahrbaraz]] in July 629.{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=72-73}} The Byzantine ''[[sakellarios]]'' Theodore,{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=35}} was placed in command of the army, and while in the area of Balqa, Arab tribes were also employed.{{sfn|Kaegi|1992|p=72-73}}\n\nMeanwhile, Muhammad had sent his emissary to the ruler of Bosra.{{sfn|El Hareir|M'Baye|2011|p=142}} While on his way to Bosra, he was executed in the village of Mu'tah by the orders of a Ghassanid official.{{sfn|El Hareir|M'Baye|2011|p=142}}\n\n==Mobilization of the armies==\nMuhammad dispatched 3,000 of his troops in the month of [[Jumada al-Awwal]] 7 (AH), 629 (CE), for a quick expedition to attack and punish the tribes for the murder of his emissary by the Ghassanids.{{sfn|El Hareir|M'Baye|2011|p=142}} The army was led by [[Zayd ibn Harithah]]; the second-in-command was [[Ja'far ibn Abi Talib]] and the third-in-command was [[Abd Allah ibn Rawahah]]. When the Muslim troops arrived at the area to the east of Jordan and learned of the size of the Byzantine army, they wanted to wait and send for reinforcements from [[Medina]]. 'Abdullah ibn Rawahah reminded them about their desire for martyrdom and questioned the move to wait when what they desire was awaiting them, so they continued marching towards the waiting army.\n\n==The battle==\nThe Muslims engaged the Byzantines at their camp by the village of Musharif and then withdrew towards Mu'tah. It was here that the two armies fought. Some Muslim sources report that the battle was fought in a valley between two heights, which negated the Byzantines' numerical superiority. During the battle, all three Muslim leaders fell one after the other as they took command of the force: first, Zayd, then Ja'far, then 'Abdullah. After the death of the latter, some of the Muslim soldiers began to rout. Thabit ibn Al-Arqam, seeing the desperate state of the Muslim forces, took up the banner and rallied his comrades thus saving the army from complete destruction. After the battle, Al-Arqam took the banner, before asking [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] to take the lead.<ref name=\"Al-Islam Ja'far\">{{citation |publisher=[[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project|Al-Islam.org]] |title=Jafar al-Tayyar |url=http://www.al-islam.org/jafar-al-tayyar-kamal-al-sayyid/jafar-al-tayyar/ |access-date=}}</ref>\n\nKhalid bin Walid reported that the fighting at Mu'tah was so intense that he used nine swords which broke during the battle. Khalid, seeing that the situation was hopeless, prepared to withdraw.

''O. unilateralis'' infects [[ant]]s of the [[Camponotini]] tribe, with the full pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandible]]s to attach themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf, where the host remains after its eventual death.<ref name = \"Mongkolsamrit2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mongkolsamrit S, Kobmoo N, Tasanathai K, Khonsanit A, Noisripoom W, Srikitikulchai P, Somnuk R, Luangsa-ard JJ | title = Life cycle, host range and temporal variation of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis''/''Hirsutella formicarium'' on Formicine ants | journal = Journal of Invertebrate Pathology | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 217\u201324 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22959811 | doi = 10.1016/j.jip.2012.08.007 }}</ref> The process leading to mortality takes 4\u201310 days, and includes a reproductive stage where [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]] grow from the ant's head, rupturing to release the fungus's spores. ''O. unilateralis'' is, in turn, also susceptible to fungal infection itself, an occurrence that can limit its impact on ant populations, which has otherwise been known to devastate ant colonies.\n\n''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' and related species are known to engage in an active [[secondary metabolism]], among other reasons, for the production of substances active as antibacterial agents that protect the fungus-host ecosystem against further pathogenesis during fungal reproduction. Because of this secondary metabolism, an interest in the species has been taken by [[natural product]]s chemists, with corresponding discovery of small molecule agents (e.g. of the [[polyketide]] family) of potential interest for use as human immunomodulatory, anti-infective, and anticancer agents.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nAfter years of research, the taxonomy of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' is becoming increasingly clear. \n\n=== ''Cordyceps'' vs ''Ophiocordyceps'' ===\n\nThroughout history there has been confusion about the distinction between both the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' [[genus]] and the ''[[Ophiocordyceps]]'' genus. These genera are different, however they were at the source of many debates about whether the zombie-ant fungus (and other fungi) belonged to one or to the other as ''Ophiocordyceps'' was only recently brought forward.\n\nThe ''Cordyceps'' genus comprises over 400 species, historically classified in the ''[[Clavicipitaceae]]'' [[family (biology)|family]] within the [[order (biology)|order]] ''[[Hypocreales]]''. The classification was based on different morphological characteristics such as filiform [[ascospores]] and cylindrical [[asci]].<ref name = \"Sung2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=Gi-Ho |last2=Hywel-Jones |first2=Nigel L. |last3=Sung |first3=Jae-Mo |last4=Luangsa-ard |first4=J.

However, in 2007, important new molecular data was tested, and enabled them to re-classify the ''Clavicipitaceae'' family. It was found that \u2018\u2019Clavicipitaceae\u2019\u2019 was in fact three distinct monophyletic families: the ''Clavicipitaceae'', the ''Cordycipitaceae'' and the ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''.<ref name = \"Sung2007\"/>\n \nThe new molecular phylogenetics studies contradicted the older classification and moved all ''Cordyceps'' species forming a sister group with ''Tolypocladium'', into ''Ophiocordycipitaceae''.

Following this, a study conducted in Brazil delimited using morphological comparison of the ascospores, germination process and asexual morphs, four different ''Ophiocordyceps'' species. Afterwards, three new species were described in the Brazilian Amazon, six in Thailand, and one in Japan. These findings provided increasing evidence for ''O. unilateralis'' being actually a complex a species.<ref name = \"Evans2018\"/>\n\nMore recently in 2018, 15 new species were described. They first used classic taxonomic criteria, and macro-morphological data with a deeper focus on ascospore and asexual morphology in order to delimit and classify species composing ''O. unilateralis s.l.''. \nThe asexual morphologies enabled to distinguish two different [[clades]] mainly composed of [[myrmecophilous|species associated with ants]] which they termed \u201c''O. unilateralis'' core clade\u201d and \u201c''O. kniphofioides'' sub-clade\u201d.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\n\nAfterwards, in the same study, they conducted further analysis using a set of different traits. They used morphological traits analysis which included both macro-morphological characters and microscopic traits. The macro-morphological characteristics consist of: the typical single stroma arising from the host\u2019s dorsal pronotum, the [[ascoma]] (perithecia) growing from the stroma.

Finally, they used other traits such as the host and the location of the death grip.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nWith these analyses, they identified different morphologies which enabled them to distribute 14 new species within the core clade, and one within the sub-clade.

Moreover, species within this sub-clade share a ''Hirsutella'' asexual morph.<ref name = \"Araujo2018\"/>\nAs for the core clade, these species are also recognizable through the hosts they infect, which are usually neotropical ant species. The sub-clade does not present the same extended phenotype with the famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d that O. unilateralis species typically exhibit.

However, the fungus may parasitize other closely related species of ants with lesser degrees of host manipulation and reproductive success.<ref name=Sample />\nThe changes in the behavior of the infected ants are very specific, giving rise to the popular term \"zombie ants\", and are tuned for the benefit of the fungus in terms of its growth and its transmission, thereby increasing its fitness. \nIn tropical forests, C. leonardi lives in the high canopy, and has an extensive network of aerial trails. Sometimes the canopy gaps are too difficult to cross, so the trails descend to the forest floor where the ants are exposed to O. unilateralis infections. The fungus\u2019 spores attach to and eventually break through the ant's exoskeleton using mechanical pressure and enzymes.<ref name=\"pmc-3204140\" /> \n\nYeast stages of the fungus spread in the ant's body and presumably produce compounds that affect the ant's [[hemocoel]], using the evolutionary trait of an [[extended phenotype]] to manipulate the behavioral patterns exhibited by the ant.<ref name=\"Andersen\" /> \nAn infected ant exhibits irregularly timed full-body convulsions that dislodge it from its canopy nest to the forest floor.<ref name=\"Hughes, D.

Once the population is of sufficient size, the fungus takes over the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), which enables it to manipulate the ant to reach the forest floor and climb up the vegetation.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nTwo candidate compounds, [[sphingosine]] and guanidinobutyric acid (GBA), were identified as responsible for the manipulation of the host brain. Both of these metabolites are known in the scientific world to be involved in neurological disorders. However, more research is needed in the field to determine whether other fungal metabolites interact with the host brain and cause higher levels of sphingosine and GBA in the brain.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nSome studies identified another compound, hypoxanthine, present at high extracellular concentration. Hypoxanthine has deleterious effects on neural tissues of the cerebral cortex, which in the context of zombie ants may indicate a way for the fungus to alter the motor neurons of the ant, consequently affecting its behavior.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\n* '''Death grip'''<br>\n\nThe famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d exhibited by the ant is also a result of the fungus-induced manipulation. The behavior consists in the ant biting the leaf so tightly that the ant is prevented from falling as it dies hanging upside down, consequently enabling the proper growth of the fungus\u2019 fruiting body.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\"/>\n\nThis is possibly a result of the atrophication of the ant\u2019s mandibular muscles caused by the secretion of fungal compounds. In multiple studies, fungal cell populations were found within atrophied mandibular muscle tissues. In fact, they infiltrate between the muscle fibers and it is a common hypothesis of researchers that they cause the muscles\u2019 atrophication the secretion of chemicals.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\nSignificant decreases in [[leucine]] concentration and [[mitochondria]] number were identified in infected ants. A deficit in leucine results in the prevention of muscle regeneration because the amino acid is a nutrient regulator of muscle protein synthesis. A decrease in mitochondria ultimately results in a reduction of energy and calcium levels due to the lack of [[ATP]] and [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which provides [[calcium]] for [[actin]]-[[myosin]] binding which is essential for muscle cells.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\nMore in depth research is needed for the identification of other fungal compounds which act to atrophy the mandibular muscles, and for the understanding of their exact effects on the ant.\n\n'''Natural products are host specific'''\n\nAnother study tested the effects of ''O. unilateralis'' on different ant species. The ant species which are normally found infected in nature exhibited a manipulated behavior, whereas the species which are not typically infected were killed by the infection, but their behavior was not altered.

Ants also groom each other to combat microscopic organisms that could potentially harm the colony. <!-- This shows that the colony is not in as much danger as previously thought. --> Additional fungi grant beneficial assistance to the colony, as well.<ref name = \"Andersen_2012\"/>\n\n== Parasite adaptation ==\n\nIn host-parasite dynamics, both the host and the parasite are under selective pressure: the parasite evolves to increase its transmission, whereas the host evolves to avoid and/or resist the infection by the parasite. <br>\n\n=== Extended phenotype ===\n\nSome parasites have evolved to manipulate their host\u2019s behavior in order to increase their transmission to uninfected susceptible individuals, thereby increasing their fitness.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Pontoppidan |first1=Maj-Britt |last2=Himaman |first2=Winanda |last3=Hywel-Jones |first3=Nigel L. |last4=Boomsma |first4=Jacobus J. |last5=Hughes |first5=David P. |last6=Dornhaus |first6=Anna |title=Graveyards on the Move: The Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Dead ''Ophiocordyceps''-Infected Ants |journal=PLoS ONE |date=12 March 2009 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e4835 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004835}}</ref> This host manipulation is termed the \"extended phenotype\" of the parasite and is a form of adaptation.

This height is considered to be optimal for fungal growth due to its humidity level and temperature. This is followed by a \u201cdeath grip\u201d of the infected ant once at what is considered to be the optimal conditions for post-mortem fungal development. This leads to the fungus continuing its growth and releasing fungal spores onto the forest floor.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\"/> These spores will then be encountered by the ants which, when the aerial foraging route is not possible, have to occasionally descend to ground level.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/> Therefore, '' O. unilateralis'' controls the ant's behaviour and this manipulation represents an adaptation for the fungus where natural selection is acting on its genes with the purpose of increasing the fungus' fitness.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\">{{cite journal |last1=de Bekker |first1=C. |last2=Merrow |first2=M. |last3=Hughes |first3=D.

To do so, ''O. unilateralis'' fortifies the ant cadaver to prevent its decay, which consequently ensures the growth of the fruiting body. Therefore, the zombie-ant fungus adapts to the short viability of its spores by increasing their production using the dead ant.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" />\n\n== Host adaptation ==\n\nThe principal hosts of ''O. unilateralis'' evolved adaptive behaviours enable to limit the contact rate between uninfected susceptible hosts and infected hosts, thereby reducing the risk of transmission. \n\n''O.unilateralis\u2019'' principal hosts evolved efficient behavioral forms of social immunity. In fact, the ants clean the exoskeletons of one another in order to decrease the presence of spores which are attached to their cuticle.<ref name=\"Hughes, D. P. 2011\"/> Studies also show that ants can sense that a member of the colony is infected; resulting in healthy ants carry the ''O. unilateralis''-infected individual far away from the colony to avoid fungal spore exposure. Plus, there are reports testifying that most worker ants remain inside the nest boundaries, consequently, only foragers are at risk of infection.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" /> \n\nMoreover, one of the fungus' principal hosts, ''Camponotus leonardi'' which occurs in tropical forests of Thailand, provided evidence for the avoidance of the forest floor by the host ants as a defence method.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/> In areas where ''O. unilateralis'' is present, ''C. leonardi'' builds its nests high in the canopy, and has a broad network of areal trails. These trails occasionally move down to the ground level, where infection and graveyards occur, due to canopy gaps too difficult for the ants to cross. Studies show that when the trails descend to the forest floor, their length is only of three to five meters before going back up into the canopy. This demonstrates the avoidance of the zones of infection by the ants. Additionally, more evidence participates in the favour of this defence method being adaptive as it is not observed in undisturbed forests where the zombie-ant fungus is not present.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/>\n\n== Genetic Basis of Behavioral Manipulation ==\n\nOphiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato is an Entomopathogenic fungi, meaning it is a parasite of insects. Parasites obtain their necessities of life by appropriating nutrients from a host, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, are no exception to this concept of the nature of a parasite (1-5). One of the most notable traits of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis in the behavior it manipulates in the host ants to maximize their own lifetime reproductive fitness (2,4).  The Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is of great interest for many reasons, one of which is its ability to manipulate their hosts behaviors without destroying the brain (1,2,3).\nInfected ant hosts have been observed climbing up vegetation and biting onto it such tat they hang off the grass. It has been suggested that these hosts hang off of the vegetation in a position that is optimal for the fungi to have maximum dispersal (2,3). This behavior is known as an extended phenotype, otherwise described as the ability for a parasites genotype to be expressed in the hosts phenotype.\nIt was hypothesized that this fungus penetrates the brain (2), however, some experiments have found Ophiocordyceps unilateralis cells are present throughout the body, but not in the brain (3). Fungal cells have been identified as hyphal bodies which take the form of yeast-like cells and grow inside the ant\u2019s bodies. The other type of fungal cell is hyphae which are filamentous branch-like structure which allow for the fungus to spread to other tissues within the host (3). It has been found that the fungal cells never actually degrade or invade the brain of the host (1,3). \nTo better understand how exactly this fungus is able to invade and manipulate the ant hosts muscles, 3-dimensional (3D) structures of this parasite-host interaction were constructed (3). Experiments have shown that hyphae fungal cells surround the ants muscle fibers, especially in the legs (3). It has also been noted that these fungal cells interact with each other via conidial tubes. These tubes allow for the transfer of cellular information between the different muscle fibers which they surround and penetrate (3). Frederickson et al. found that these cell\u2013cell connections resulted in a 3D network of hyphal bodies that surrounded the muscle fiber as seen in the following figure (3).\n from Frederickson et al. \nSeveral studies have been done on entomopathogenic fungi to try and understand the genetic basis of this ability to alter their host\u2019s behaviors. Will et al. research used comparative transcriptomics (compared RNA sequences) between different entomopathogenic fungi-ant species interactions to see if there were any candidate genes which underly the manipulation of the ant\u2019s behavior (2). \n\n  from Will I et al.\nThe figure above shows the major genetic themes in infected host ants between various species of entomopathogenic fungi obtained from Will et al\u2019s comparative transcriptomics results and the associated behaviors of the hosts. Will et al. found that there were several recurring candidate genes found in infected hosts (5). Will et all\u2019s findings corroborate past literature by finding genetic basis of the extended phenotype. They saw changes in gene expression which modifies nutritional physiology and neuronal-activity. of the host (5).  One of the manipulations is to odor receptors where they observed regulation changes in odor receptor genes and binding proteins. Communication between ants relies on pheromone and odor detection, resulting in impaired response to external stimuli (5). is a disruption to the hosts innate circadian rhythms and caste identities  (1-5). There is still much to learn about the genetic basis of these relationships but understanding how a host is manipulated by these entomopathogenic fungi.\n\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Sample>{{cite news | first = Ian | last = Sample | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/18/zombie-carpenter-ant-fungus | title = 'Zombie ants' controlled by parasitic fungus for 48m years | date = 18 August 2010 | department = News \u00bb Science \u00bb Microbiology | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ponto>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pontoppidan MB, Himaman W, Hywel-Jones NL, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = Graveyards on the move: The spatio-temporal distribution of dead ''Ophiocordyceps''-infected ants | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = e4835 | date = 12 March 2009 | pmid = 19279680 | pmc = 2652714 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004835 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4835P }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=sung>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sung GH, Hywel-Jones NL, Sung JM, Luangsa-Ard JJ, Shrestha B, Spatafora JW | title = Phylogenetic classification of ''Cordyceps'' and the clavicipitaceous fungi | journal = Studies in Mycology | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 5\u201359 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18490993 | pmc = 2104736 | doi = 10.3114/sim.2007.57.01 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Zombie>{{cite news | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100818105730.htm | title = Fossil Reveals 48-Million-Year History of Zombie Ants | publisher = [[Science Daily]] | date = 18 August 2010 | accessdate = 2010-09-12}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=MBank>{{cite web | url = http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=281145 | title = Ophiocordyceps unilateralis | website = [[MycoBank]] | publisher = [[International Mycological Association]] | accessdate = 2011-07-19}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hughes>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes DP, Wappler T, Labandeira CC | title = Ancient death-grip leaf scars reveal ant fungal parasitism | journal = [[Biology Letters]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 67\u201370 | date = 23 February 2011 | pmid = 20719770 | pmc = 3030878 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0521 | origyear = 18 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Andersen>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen SB, Gerritsma S, Yusah KM, Mayntz D, Hywel-Jones NL, Billen J, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = The life of a dead ant: The expression of an adaptive extended phenotype | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 174 | issue = 3 | pages = 424\u2013433 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19627240 | doi = 10.1086/603640 | jstor = 10.1086/603640 | url = https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/the-life-of-a-dead-ant(e6374602-b2a0-496c-b78e-774b34fb152b).html }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Xiao>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiao JH, Zhong JJ | title = Secondary metabolites from ''Cordyceps'' species and their antitumor activity studies | journal = Recent Patents on Biotechnology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 123\u2013137 | year = 2007 | pmid = 19075836 | doi = 10.2174/187220807780809454 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Wongsa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wongsa P, Tasanatai K, Watts P, Hywel-Jones N | title = Isolation and ''in vitro'' cultivation of the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = [[Mycological Research]] | volume = 109 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 936\u2013940 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16175796 | doi = 10.1017/S0953756205003321 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Unagul>{{cite journal | vauthors = Unagul P, Wongsa P, Kittakoop P, Intamas S, Srikitikulchai P, Tanticharoen M | title = Production of red pigments by the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' BCC 1869 | journal = Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 135\u2013140 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15891934 | doi = 10.1007/s10295-005-0213-6 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kittakoopa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kittakoopa P, Punyaa J, Kongsaeree P, Lertwerawat Y, Jintasirikul A, Tanticharoena M, Thebtaranonth Y | year = 1999 | title = Bioactive naphthoquinones from ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 453\u2013457 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00272-1}}</ref>\n}}\n<ref> de Bekker, C., Ohm, R.

''O. unilateralis'' infects [[ant]]s of the [[Camponotini]] tribe, with the full pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandible]]s to attach themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf, where the host remains after its eventual death.<ref name = \"Mongkolsamrit2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mongkolsamrit S, Kobmoo N, Tasanathai K, Khonsanit A, Noisripoom W, Srikitikulchai P, Somnuk R, Luangsa-ard JJ | title = Life cycle, host range and temporal variation of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis''/''Hirsutella formicarium'' on Formicine ants | journal = Journal of Invertebrate Pathology | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 217\u201324 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22959811 | doi = 10.1016/j.jip.2012.08.007 }}</ref> The process leading to mortality takes 4\u201310 days, and includes a reproductive stage where [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]] grow from the ant's head, rupturing to release the fungus's spores. ''O. unilateralis'' is, in turn, also susceptible to fungal infection itself, an occurrence that can limit its impact on ant populations, which has otherwise been known to devastate ant colonies.\n\n''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' and related species are known to engage in an active [[secondary metabolism]], among other reasons, for the production of substances active as antibacterial agents that protect the fungus-host ecosystem against further pathogenesis during fungal reproduction. Because of this secondary metabolism, an interest in the species has been taken by [[natural product]]s chemists, with corresponding discovery of small molecule agents (e.g. of the [[polyketide]] family) of potential interest for use as human immunomodulatory, anti-infective, and anticancer agents.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nAfter years of research, the taxonomy of ''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis'' is becoming increasingly clear. \n\n=== ''Cordyceps'' vs ''Ophiocordyceps'' ===\n\nThroughout history there has been confusion about the distinction between both the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' [[genus]] and the ''[[Ophiocordyceps]]'' genus. These genera are different, however they were at the source of many debates about whether the zombie-ant fungus (and other fungi) belonged to one or to the other as ''Ophiocordyceps'' was only recently brought forward.\n\nThe ''Cordyceps'' genus comprises over 400 species, historically classified in the ''[[Clavicipitaceae]]'' [[family (biology)|family]] within the [[order (biology)|order]] ''[[Hypocreales]]''.

For this purpose, the fungus\u2019 [[hypha]] pierces the [[exoskeleton]] using enzymes such as [[chitinase]], [[lipase]] and [[protease]], combined with mechanical pressure.<ref name=pmc-3204140/>\n\n* '''Convulsions and climbing behaviour'''<br>\n\nAfter the fungus enters the ant it propagates, and fungal cells can be found beside the host\u2019s brain. Once the population is of sufficient size, the fungus takes over the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), which enables it to manipulate the ant to reach the forest floor and climb up the vegetation.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nTwo candidate compounds, [[sphingosine]] and guanidinobutyric acid (GBA), were identified as responsible for the manipulation of the host brain. Both of these metabolites are known in the scientific world to be involved in neurological disorders. However, more research is needed in the field to determine whether other fungal metabolites interact with the host brain and cause higher levels of sphingosine and GBA in the brain.<ref name = \"deBekkerA2014\"/>\n\nSome studies identified another compound, hypoxanthine, present at high extracellular concentration. Hypoxanthine has deleterious effects on neural tissues of the cerebral cortex, which in the context of zombie ants may indicate a way for the fungus to alter the motor neurons of the ant, consequently affecting its behavior.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\n* '''Death grip'''<br>\n\nThe famous \u201cdeath grip\u201d exhibited by the ant is also a result of the fungus-induced manipulation. The behavior consists in the ant biting the leaf so tightly that the ant is prevented from falling as it dies hanging upside down, consequently enabling the proper growth of the fungus\u2019 fruiting body.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\"/>\n\nThis is possibly a result of the atrophication of the ant\u2019s mandibular muscles caused by the secretion of fungal compounds. In multiple studies, fungal cell populations were found within atrophied mandibular muscle tissues. In fact, they infiltrate between the muscle fibers and it is a common hypothesis of researchers that they cause the muscles\u2019 atrophication the secretion of chemicals.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\nSignificant decreases in [[leucine]] concentration and [[mitochondria]] number were identified in infected ants. A deficit in leucine results in the prevention of muscle regeneration because the amino acid is a nutrient regulator of muscle protein synthesis. A decrease in mitochondria ultimately results in a reduction of energy and calcium levels due to the lack of [[ATP]] and [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] which provides [[calcium]] for [[actin]]-[[myosin]] binding which is essential for muscle cells.<ref name = \"Shanshan2019\"/>\n\nMore in depth research is needed for the identification of other fungal compounds which act to atrophy the mandibular muscles, and for the understanding of their exact effects on the ant.\n\n'''Natural products are host specific'''\n\nAnother study tested the effects of ''O. unilateralis'' on different ant species. The ant species which are normally found infected in nature exhibited a manipulated behavior, whereas the species which are not typically infected were killed by the infection, but their behavior was not altered.

This leads to the fungus continuing its growth and releasing fungal spores onto the forest floor.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\"/> These spores will then be encountered by the ants which, when the aerial foraging route is not possible, have to occasionally descend to ground level.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/> Therefore, '' O. unilateralis'' controls the ant's behaviour and this manipulation represents an adaptation for the fungus where natural selection is acting on its genes with the purpose of increasing the fungus' fitness.<ref name = \"deBekker2014\">{{cite journal |last1=de Bekker |first1=C. |last2=Merrow |first2=M. |last3=Hughes |first3=D. P. |title=From Behavior to Mechanisms: An Integrative Approach to the Manipulation by a Parasitic Fungus (''Ophiocordyceps unilateralis s.l.'') of Its Host Ants (''Camponotus spp.'') |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |date=6 June 2014 |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=166\u2013176 |doi=10.1093/icb/icu063}}</ref>\n\n=== Somatic Investment? ===\n\nSome studies proposed a theory in which ''O. unilateralis'' has another possible form of adaptation which ensures its repeated reproduction.\nThis would be crucial for ''O. unilateralis s.l.'' species as they can produce and release within the air, clear and thin-walled spores which are susceptible to environmental conditions such as [[UV radiation]] and dryness.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" >{{cite journal |last1=Andersen |first1=Sandra B. |last2=Ferrari |first2=Matthew |last3=Evans |first3=Harry C. |last4=Elliot |first4=Simon L. |last5=Boomsma |first5=Jacobus J. |last6=Hughes |first6=David P. |last7=Marshall |first7=James A.R. |title=Disease Dynamics in a Specialized Parasite of Ant Societies |journal=PLoS ONE |date=2 May 2012 |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=e36352 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0036352}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, studies suggest that the short viability of the fungal spores led to the need of [[somatic cell|somatic]] investment (growth/survival) by the parasite in order to sustain the growth of the fungus\u2019 fruiting body on its host, thereby enabling successive reproduction. To do so, ''O. unilateralis'' fortifies the ant cadaver to prevent its decay, which consequently ensures the growth of the fruiting body. Therefore, the zombie-ant fungus adapts to the short viability of its spores by increasing their production using the dead ant.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" />\n\n== Host adaptation ==\n\nThe principal hosts of ''O. unilateralis'' evolved adaptive behaviours enable to limit the contact rate between uninfected susceptible hosts and infected hosts, thereby reducing the risk of transmission. \n\n''O.unilateralis\u2019'' principal hosts evolved efficient behavioral forms of social immunity. In fact, the ants clean the exoskeletons of one another in order to decrease the presence of spores which are attached to their cuticle.<ref name=\"Hughes, D. P. 2011\"/> Studies also show that ants can sense that a member of the colony is infected; resulting in healthy ants carry the ''O. unilateralis''-infected individual far away from the colony to avoid fungal spore exposure. Plus, there are reports testifying that most worker ants remain inside the nest boundaries, consequently, only foragers are at risk of infection.<ref name = \"Andersen2012\" /> \n\nMoreover, one of the fungus' principal hosts, ''Camponotus leonardi'' which occurs in tropical forests of Thailand, provided evidence for the avoidance of the forest floor by the host ants as a defence method.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/> In areas where ''O. unilateralis'' is present, ''C. leonardi'' builds its nests high in the canopy, and has a broad network of areal trails. These trails occasionally move down to the ground level, where infection and graveyards occur, due to canopy gaps too difficult for the ants to cross. Studies show that when the trails descend to the forest floor, their length is only of three to five meters before going back up into the canopy. This demonstrates the avoidance of the zones of infection by the ants. Additionally, more evidence participates in the favour of this defence method being adaptive as it is not observed in undisturbed forests where the zombie-ant fungus is not present.<ref name = \"Pontoppidan2009\"/>\n\n== Genetic Basis of Behavioral Manipulation ==\n\nOphiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato is an Entomopathogenic fungi, meaning it is a parasite of insects. Parasites obtain their necessities of life by appropriating nutrients from a host, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, are no exception to this concept of the nature of a parasite (1-5). One of the most notable traits of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis in the behavior it manipulates in the host ants to maximize their own lifetime reproductive fitness (2,4).  The Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is of great interest for many reasons, one of which is its ability to manipulate their hosts behaviors without destroying the brain (1,2,3).\nInfected ant hosts have been observed climbing up vegetation and biting onto it such tat they hang off the grass. It has been suggested that these hosts hang off of the vegetation in a position that is optimal for the fungi to have maximum dispersal (2,3). This behavior is known as an extended phenotype, otherwise described as the ability for a parasites genotype to be expressed in the hosts phenotype.\nIt was hypothesized that this fungus penetrates the brain (2), however, some experiments have found Ophiocordyceps unilateralis cells are present throughout the body, but not in the brain (3). Fungal cells have been identified as hyphal bodies which take the form of yeast-like cells and grow inside the ant\u2019s bodies. The other type of fungal cell is hyphae which are filamentous branch-like structure which allow for the fungus to spread to other tissues within the host (3). It has been found that the fungal cells never actually degrade or invade the brain of the host (1,3). \nTo better understand how exactly this fungus is able to invade and manipulate the ant hosts muscles, 3-dimensional (3D) structures of this parasite-host interaction were constructed (3). Experiments have shown that hyphae fungal cells surround the ants muscle fibers, especially in the legs (3). It has also been noted that these fungal cells interact with each other via conidial tubes. These tubes allow for the transfer of cellular information between the different muscle fibers which they surround and penetrate (3). Frederickson et al. found that these cell\u2013cell connections resulted in a 3D network of hyphal bodies that surrounded the muscle fiber as seen in the following figure (3).\n from Frederickson et al. \nSeveral studies have been done on entomopathogenic fungi to try and understand the genetic basis of this ability to alter their host\u2019s behaviors. Will et al. research used comparative transcriptomics (compared RNA sequences) between different entomopathogenic fungi-ant species interactions to see if there were any candidate genes which underly the manipulation of the ant\u2019s behavior (2). \n\n  from Will I et al.\nThe figure above shows the major genetic themes in infected host ants between various species of entomopathogenic fungi obtained from Will et al\u2019s comparative transcriptomics results and the associated behaviors of the hosts. Will et al. found that there were several recurring candidate genes found in infected hosts (5). Will et all\u2019s findings corroborate past literature by finding genetic basis of the extended phenotype. They saw changes in gene expression which modifies nutritional physiology and neuronal-activity. of the host (5).  One of the manipulations is to odor receptors where they observed regulation changes in odor receptor genes and binding proteins. Communication between ants relies on pheromone and odor detection, resulting in impaired response to external stimuli (5). is a disruption to the hosts innate circadian rhythms and caste identities  (1-5). There is still much to learn about the genetic basis of these relationships but understanding how a host is manipulated by these entomopathogenic fungi.\n\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Sample>{{cite news | first = Ian | last = Sample | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/18/zombie-carpenter-ant-fungus | title = 'Zombie ants' controlled by parasitic fungus for 48m years | date = 18 August 2010 | department = News \u00bb Science \u00bb Microbiology | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ponto>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pontoppidan MB, Himaman W, Hywel-Jones NL, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = Graveyards on the move: The spatio-temporal distribution of dead ''Ophiocordyceps''-infected ants | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = e4835 | date = 12 March 2009 | pmid = 19279680 | pmc = 2652714 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004835 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4835P }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=sung>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sung GH, Hywel-Jones NL, Sung JM, Luangsa-Ard JJ, Shrestha B, Spatafora JW | title = Phylogenetic classification of ''Cordyceps'' and the clavicipitaceous fungi | journal = Studies in Mycology | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 5\u201359 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18490993 | pmc = 2104736 | doi = 10.3114/sim.2007.57.01 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Zombie>{{cite news | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100818105730.htm | title = Fossil Reveals 48-Million-Year History of Zombie Ants | publisher = [[Science Daily]] | date = 18 August 2010 | accessdate = 2010-09-12}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=MBank>{{cite web | url = http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=281145 | title = Ophiocordyceps unilateralis | website = [[MycoBank]] | publisher = [[International Mycological Association]] | accessdate = 2011-07-19}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hughes>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes DP, Wappler T, Labandeira CC | title = Ancient death-grip leaf scars reveal ant fungal parasitism | journal = [[Biology Letters]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 67\u201370 | date = 23 February 2011 | pmid = 20719770 | pmc = 3030878 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0521 | origyear = 18 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Andersen>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen SB, Gerritsma S, Yusah KM, Mayntz D, Hywel-Jones NL, Billen J, Boomsma JJ, Hughes DP | title = The life of a dead ant: The expression of an adaptive extended phenotype | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 174 | issue = 3 | pages = 424\u2013433 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19627240 | doi = 10.1086/603640 | jstor = 10.1086/603640 | url = https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/the-life-of-a-dead-ant(e6374602-b2a0-496c-b78e-774b34fb152b).html }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Xiao>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiao JH, Zhong JJ | title = Secondary metabolites from ''Cordyceps'' species and their antitumor activity studies | journal = Recent Patents on Biotechnology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 123\u2013137 | year = 2007 | pmid = 19075836 | doi = 10.2174/187220807780809454 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Wongsa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wongsa P, Tasanatai K, Watts P, Hywel-Jones N | title = Isolation and ''in vitro'' cultivation of the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = [[Mycological Research]] | volume = 109 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 936\u2013940 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16175796 | doi = 10.1017/S0953756205003321 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Unagul>{{cite journal | vauthors = Unagul P, Wongsa P, Kittakoop P, Intamas S, Srikitikulchai P, Tanticharoen M | title = Production of red pigments by the insect pathogenic fungus ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' BCC 1869 | journal = Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 135\u2013140 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15891934 | doi = 10.1007/s10295-005-0213-6 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kittakoopa>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kittakoopa P, Punyaa J, Kongsaeree P, Lertwerawat Y, Jintasirikul A, Tanticharoena M, Thebtaranonth Y | year = 1999 | title = Bioactive naphthoquinones from ''Cordyceps unilateralis'' | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 453\u2013457 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00272-1}}</ref>\n}}\n<ref> de Bekker, C., Ohm, R.

In modern times, a shorter cycle is written as 24,000 years by another author is more commonly accepted as 25,772 years because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system {{Original research|date=February 2020}}. However, the traditional timescale is more widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga.  The Yuga cycle contains 4 yugas (ages) - Satya Yuga, Dwapar, Treta and Kali Yuga.\n\nThe age of Kali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Dwapar Yuga = 432,000 * 2 = '''864,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Treta Yuga = 432,000 * 3 = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nThe age of Satya Yuga = 432,000 * 4 = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is the entire one cycle = 4,320,000 years. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night is of equal duration. So the entire day of Brahma becomes - \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 years and passes away and the universe ends. A new Brahma is born and creates the universe again. \n\nSo the entire duration of life of universe is -\n\n8,640,000,000 * 365 * 100 = '''315,360,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nThis shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle.meaning that the following calculation relating to Mahayugas is erroneously used:\n\n* Satya Yuga = 4800 \u00d7 360 = 1,728,000 years\n* Treta Yuga = 3600 \u00d7 360 = 1,296,000 years\n* Dvapara Yuga = 2400 \u00d7 360 = 864,000 years\n* Kali Yuga = 1200 \u00d7 360 = 432,000 years\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 438,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). This originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\". This was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]]. However, both the Mahabharata (which was used by Aryabhatta in his calculations) and the Manu Smriti have the original value of 12,000 years for one half of the Yuga cycle.\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:<ref name=penprase182/>\n\n*Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}</ref>\n*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga, equal to 4.32 million human years.<ref name=penprase182>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}</ref> According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4320 million human years.

The duration of the Satya Yuga is therefore 4,800 \u00d7 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tret\u0101 Yuga is 3,600 \u00d7 360, or 1,296,000 years.

The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\n==Decline==\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' \u2013  Virtue reigns supreme.

His night is of equal duration. So the entire day of Brahma becomes - \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 years and passes away and the universe ends. A new Brahma is born and creates the universe again. \n\nSo the entire duration of life of universe is -\n\n8,640,000,000 * 365 * 100 = '''315,360,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nThis shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle.meaning that the following calculation relating to Mahayugas is erroneously used:\n\n* Satya Yuga = 4800 \u00d7 360 = 1,728,000 years\n* Treta Yuga = 3600 \u00d7 360 = 1,296,000 years\n* Dvapara Yuga = 2400 \u00d7 360 = 864,000 years\n* Kali Yuga = 1200 \u00d7 360 = 432,000 years\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 438,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). This originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\". This was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]]. However, both the Mahabharata (which was used by Aryabhatta in his calculations) and the Manu Smriti have the original value of 12,000 years for one half of the Yuga cycle.\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:<ref name=penprase182/>\n\n*Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}</ref>\n*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga, equal to 4.32 million human years.<ref name=penprase182>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}</ref> According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4320 million human years.

The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods.

Borussia Dortmund began the 2001\u201302 season strongly and eventually won the [[Bundesliga]] in [[2001\u201302 Bundesliga|2001\u201302]].

In a match against [[SC Freiburg]], Lehmann kicked opposing attacker [[Soumaila Coulibaly]] after they collided in the penalty area. Lehmann was suspended afterwards. He currently holds the record for most red cards for any Borussia Dortmund player, and the record for most red cards for a goalkeeper in the German Bundesliga.\n\nLehmann's form slipped in the 2002\u201303 season, along with Borussia Dortmund's. His time at Dortmund was winding down, and after the season concluded, he left Dortmund. He was replaced by [[Roman Weidenfeller]] and [[Guillaume Warmuz]], who had just left Arsenal.\n\n===Arsenal===\n====2003\u201304 season====\nLehmann joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 25 July 2003 replacing the recently departed [[David Seaman]]. Arsenal's 2003\u201304 season was historic. The Gunners finished the [[2003\u201304 FA Premier League]] season unbeaten, becoming the first English club to accomplish the feat in the modern era and only the second to ever have an unbeaten season in English football's top tier, the only other team to accomplish this feat being [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in the 1888\u201389 season. Lehmann played every match in Arsenal's unbeaten season, though his swashbuckling playing style did lead to occasional mistakes.

And Arsenal continued unbeaten until 24 October 2004. At the end of his first season at Arsenal, he had already played 54 times earning himself a [[Premier League]] winners medal.\n\n====2004\u201305 season====\nBy the middle of the [[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305]] season, Lehmann's inconsistent form lead to Spaniard [[Manuel Almunia]] starting in several matches instead. However, Almunia made a series of mistakes during several games, thus allowing Lehmann to regain his position. At the end of that season, as speculation again began to mount that he would be replaced over the summer, Lehmann cemented his position in the Arsenal goal with a man-of-the-match performance against Manchester United in the 2005 [[FA Cup]] final. He made several important saves and demonstrated great positional sense to keep the score 0\u20130 after [[extra time]], and then crucially saved [[Paul Scholes]]' shot in the penalty shootout, which Arsenal won 5\u20134.\n\n====2005\u201306 season====\nLehmann had an outstanding [[2005-06 in English football|2005\u201306 season]] with Arsenal, making his 100th Premier League appearance for the club in their game against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 15 April 2006. He was a key factor in his side's first-ever accession to the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] final; during their run Arsenal broke the record for the most consecutive [[Shutout|clean sheets]] in the Champions League with ten, breaking the record of seven that Milan had set just one year before. That run formed the bulk of an 853-minute spell without conceding a goal, overtaking the CL record for an individual goalkeeper set by [[Edwin van der Sar]].\n\n[[Bayern Munich]]'s [[Hasan Salihamid\u017ei\u0107]] had been the last to net against Lehmann, in the 64th minute of a last 16 first leg match on 22 February 2005; Lehmann kept a clean sheet in the second leg, and then a further seven during Arsenal's run in 2005\u201306 (Almunia played in the other five matches in the group stages). The final clean sheet was earned in the semi-finals against [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]], after Lehmann saved an 89th minute [[Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme]] penalty. Lehmann maintained his shutout run despite an ignominious end to his [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]] against [[FC Barcelona]]; with the score still at 0\u20130 he was sent off in the 18th minute for a [[professional foul]] after bringing down [[Samuel Eto'o]], making him the first player and only goalkeeper to ever be sent off in a Champions League/European Cup final, but it did not stop him from being named the Champions League Goalkeeper of the Year for the 2005\u201306 season after going 853 minutes without conceding a goal.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/arsenal/article1706542.ece |location=London |work=The Times |first=Matt |last=Hughes |title=Lehmann to sign new contract |date=26 April 2007}}</ref>\n[[File:Jens Lehmann dive.JPG|thumb|250px|Lehmann diving to save a shot during a warm-up.]]\n\n====2006\u201307 season====\nHis remarkable run was finally ended on 13 September 2006 by [[Hamburger SV]]'s [[Boubacar Sanogo]], who scored a consolation goal in the 89th minute of Arsenal's first group stage match of the [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|2006\u201307]] Champions League season.\n\nLehmann's contract at Arsenal was due to expire in summer 2007 and during the [[2006-07 in English football|2006\u201307]] season there was much speculation he would leave the club on a [[Bosman ruling|Bosman]] transfer.

Due to Almunia catching flu straight after the injury, Lehmann kept his place in goal for the following three matches in February, including the first leg of the UEFA Champions League round of 16 against Milan, but also the 4\u20130 loss to arch rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup.\n\nAfter another injury to Almunia in early April 2008, Lehmann was back in goal for the away game against Manchester United on 13 April 2008. Arsenal lost that game 2\u20131, virtually ending their Premier League title hopes for the season, their third consecutive season without a major trophy. There was speculation that would be his last game for Arsenal, but on 19 April Lehmann played in the home game against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], which Arsenal won 2\u20130. The following week, \u0141ukasz Fabia\u0144ski was given his Premier League debut against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and Almunia returned to the bench for the game. However, Lehmann made another appearance and was brought on for Fabia\u0144ski in the last 20 minutes of the game against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 4 May 2008, Arsenal's final home game of the season.

Lehmann was in the squad  which finished as runners-up in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], but he didn't play any matches in the competition, as Kahn was still Germany's first choice goalkeeper.\n\nOn 7 April 2006, however, German national coach [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] announced that Lehmann would be Germany's first-choice goalkeeper for the upcoming [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. Lehmann conceded two goals in Germany's opening match of the World Cup, both scored by [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica's]] [[Paulo Wanchope]] although Germany won the match 4\u20132. Lehmann played strongly in the next three games, conceding no goals and allowing Germany to sweep their group undefeated and beat Sweden convincingly in the Round of 16.\n\nThe highlight of Lehmann's international career came in the quarterfinal match (30 June 2006, Olympiastadion, Berlin) against Argentina. The game remained tied 1\u20131 after 90 minutes and extra time. The game came down to penalty kicks and Lehmann carried his team through, picking the right direction for all spot kicks, making saves from Argentinians [[Roberto Ayala]] and [[Esteban Cambiasso]] and almost saving a third. Meanwhile, the Germans made all four of the necessary spot kicks to win the penalty shoot-out 4\u20132. Lehmann's prowess in the shootout was aided by notes given to him before the kicks \u2013 an idea from Germany's chief scout, Swiss-born [[:de:Urs Siegenthaler|Urs Siegenthaler]] \u2013 with Lehmann keeping the paper in his right sock. Before the last shot from Cambiasso, Lehmann looked at the paper for a long time even though Cambiasso's name was not even on it. The story about the paper features in the film ''[[Deutschland. Ein Sommerm\u00e4rchen]]''. Lehmann was considered a hero by the German public after these saves, and he received praise even from long-time rival and backup keeper Oliver Kahn.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lehmann had penalty taker notes |work=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/germany/5136802.stm |accessdate=1 July 2006 |date=1 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nGermany's opponent in the semifinals was Italy. The Italians had the better chances to score but Lehmann made several spectacular saves, including one in extra time where he dived out of goal to intercept an Italian player who had broken loose from the defence, punching the ball clear with his fist and temporarily knocking out the Italian in the process. He allowed two goals within a minute of each other with only a few seconds remaining in extra time, which put Italy into the World Cup final.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991640.stm |title=Germany 0-2 Italy (aet) |work=BBC Sport |date=4 July 2006 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> The retiring Oliver Kahn was given the honour of starting in the third place play-off match, an offer made by Lehmann himself.

Germany defeated Portugal 3\u20131 for the third place (bronze) medals.\n\nIn August 2006, Lehmann revealed that during the World Cup he was suffering with a foot injury that he claims was a result of wearing different boots. The [[German Football Association]] ordered their players to wear only those manufactured by principal sponsor [[Adidas]] as opposed to Lehmann's sponsor [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. This has now been overturned thanks to Lehmann and several other players protesting about the decision and the players are now free to wear boots made by other companies.\n\nIn August 2006, Lehmann suggested that he may retire from league and international football after playing for Germany in [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lehmann plans to retire after Euro 2008 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=375850&cc=4716 |publisher=ESPNsoccernet |date=14 August 2006 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> However, he subsequently stated in January 2007 that he had not made any decision on retirement.\n\nLehmann set a national team record of not conceding a goal for 681 minutes in a friendly against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] on 26 March 2008. In Euro 2008, Lehmann started every match as Germany reached the final. They lost 1\u20130 to Spain; a lack of communication between Lehmann and [[Philipp Lahm]] allowed Spain's [[Fernando Torres]] to net the only goal in the match.\n\nOn 8 August 2008, Lehmann announced his retirement from international football. He made his decision following a two-hour talk with the German national team's coach [[Joachim L\u00f6w]] and goalkeeping coach [[Andreas K\u00f6pke]], stating that he was not able to give them any guarantee that he will continue to play football following the end of his one-year contract with VfB Stuttgart in June 2009.

He was a member of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s [[The Invincibles (football)#Arsenal|'Invincibles']], playing every match of their unbeaten title-winning season in 2003\u201304. He also holds the [[UEFA Champions League]] record for the most consecutive [[clean sheets]], not conceding a single goal in 10 consecutive matches while he played for Arsenal.\n\n==Club career==\n===Schalke 04===\nLehmann started his career in the 1988\u201389 season<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rsssf.com/players/jlehmanndata.html |title=Jens Lehmann - Matches and Goals in Bundesliga |first=Matthias |last=Arnhold |date=1 October 2015 |accessdate=12 November 2015 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation}}</ref> with [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], playing for them for nearly a decade.

Milan===\nLehmann left Schalke for [[A.C. Milan]] in 1998, but his performances were below par. In one game [[Gabriel Batistuta]] scored a hat-trick against him, including a goal from a free kick in the box which Lehmann had conceded by handling a back pass.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZxwEkZvAwQ |title=Batistuta Free Kick |accessdate=15 September 2006 |publisher=YouTube |date=23 September 2009}}</ref> In another game he was substituted after giving away a penalty.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/30/teams-punished-defeats-football-questions |title=Which teams have been punished for defeats? |work=The Guardian |accessdate=27 January 2010 |location=London |first=John |last=Ashdown |date=30 September 2009}}</ref> After just five matches, Lehmann was dropped.

Rumors arose that Lehmann might leave, with supporters viewing him critically.\n\nBut the tide eventually turned and Lehmann's form improved, becoming a reliable figure in the team. He played a significant part in the club's return to the upper echelons of German and European football. Borussia Dortmund began the 2001\u201302 season strongly and eventually won the [[Bundesliga]] in [[2001\u201302 Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. That same year, Borussia Dortmund reached the UEFA-Cup final, though the team lost to Dutch club Feyenoord Rotterdam.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rsssf.com/players/lehmann-in-ec.html |title=Jens Lehmann - Matches in European Cups |first=Marcel |last=Haisma |date=15 January 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2015 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation}}</ref>\n\nAround this time, Lehmann developed a reputation for his poor disciplinary record. In a match against [[SC Freiburg]], Lehmann kicked opposing attacker [[Soumaila Coulibaly]] after they collided in the penalty area. Lehmann was suspended afterwards. He currently holds the record for most red cards for any Borussia Dortmund player, and the record for most red cards for a goalkeeper in the German Bundesliga.\n\nLehmann's form slipped in the 2002\u201303 season, along with Borussia Dortmund's. His time at Dortmund was winding down, and after the season concluded, he left Dortmund. He was replaced by [[Roman Weidenfeller]] and [[Guillaume Warmuz]], who had just left Arsenal.\n\n===Arsenal===\n====2003\u201304 season====\nLehmann joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 25 July 2003 replacing the recently departed [[David Seaman]]. Arsenal's 2003\u201304 season was historic. The Gunners finished the [[2003\u201304 FA Premier League]] season unbeaten, becoming the first English club to accomplish the feat in the modern era and only the second to ever have an unbeaten season in English football's top tier, the only other team to accomplish this feat being [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in the 1888\u201389 season. Lehmann played every match in Arsenal's unbeaten season, though his swashbuckling playing style did lead to occasional mistakes. For example, in the title-winning match at local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], Lehmann pushed Tottenham striker [[Robbie Keane]] as the pair waited for a Tottenham corner.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3628573.stm |title=Arsenal clinch title |accessdate=30 November 2007 |work=BBC Sport |date=25 April 2004}}</ref> He also committed an error that led to the equalising goal in Arsenal's Champions League defeat at home to Chelsea the same season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1166223,00.html |title=Hot-headed German Goalie Faces London Bench |accessdate=30 November 2007 |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=9 April 2004}}</ref> Despite these mistakes, Lehmann's addition to the Arsenal team had a major effect on Arsenal's ability to finish unbeaten. And Arsenal continued unbeaten until 24 October 2004. At the end of his first season at Arsenal, he had already played 54 times earning himself a [[Premier League]] winners medal.\n\n====2004\u201305 season====\nBy the middle of the [[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305]] season, Lehmann's inconsistent form lead to Spaniard [[Manuel Almunia]] starting in several matches instead. However, Almunia made a series of mistakes during several games, thus allowing Lehmann to regain his position. At the end of that season, as speculation again began to mount that he would be replaced over the summer, Lehmann cemented his position in the Arsenal goal with a man-of-the-match performance against Manchester United in the 2005 [[FA Cup]] final. He made several important saves and demonstrated great positional sense to keep the score 0\u20130 after [[extra time]], and then crucially saved [[Paul Scholes]]' shot in the penalty shootout, which Arsenal won 5\u20134.\n\n====2005\u201306 season====\nLehmann had an outstanding [[2005-06 in English football|2005\u201306 season]] with Arsenal, making his 100th Premier League appearance for the club in their game against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 15 April 2006. He was a key factor in his side's first-ever accession to the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] final; during their run Arsenal broke the record for the most consecutive [[Shutout|clean sheets]] in the Champions League with ten, breaking the record of seven that Milan had set just one year before. That run formed the bulk of an 853-minute spell without conceding a goal, overtaking the CL record for an individual goalkeeper set by [[Edwin van der Sar]].\n\n[[Bayern Munich]]'s [[Hasan Salihamid\u017ei\u0107]] had been the last to net against Lehmann, in the 64th minute of a last 16 first leg match on 22 February 2005; Lehmann kept a clean sheet in the second leg, and then a further seven during Arsenal's run in 2005\u201306 (Almunia played in the other five matches in the group stages). The final clean sheet was earned in the semi-finals against [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]], after Lehmann saved an 89th minute [[Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme]] penalty. Lehmann maintained his shutout run despite an ignominious end to his [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]] against [[FC Barcelona]]; with the score still at 0\u20130 he was sent off in the 18th minute for a [[professional foul]] after bringing down [[Samuel Eto'o]], making him the first player and only goalkeeper to ever be sent off in a Champions League/European Cup final, but it did not stop him from being named the Champions League Goalkeeper of the Year for the 2005\u201306 season after going 853 minutes without conceding a goal.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/arsenal/article1706542.ece |location=London |work=The Times |first=Matt |last=Hughes |title=Lehmann to sign new contract |date=26 April 2007}}</ref>\n[[File:Jens Lehmann dive.JPG|thumb|250px|Lehmann diving to save a shot during a warm-up.]]\n\n====2006\u201307 season====\nHis remarkable run was finally ended on 13 September 2006 by [[Hamburger SV]]'s [[Boubacar Sanogo]], who scored a consolation goal in the 89th minute of Arsenal's first group stage match of the [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|2006\u201307]] Champions League season.\n\nLehmann's contract at Arsenal was due to expire in summer 2007 and during the [[2006-07 in English football|2006\u201307]] season there was much speculation he would leave the club on a [[Bosman ruling|Bosman]] transfer.

However, Lehmann's blushes were spared late in the game as Arsenal won 2\u20131. In his second league match against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] he fumbled a [[David Dunn]] shot to allow Blackburn to equalise, in a game that finished 1\u20131. On 24 August, the BBC reported that he returned to Germany to treat an [[Achilles tendon]] injury which he picked up during international duty against [[England national football team|England]], meaning [[Manuel Almunia]] took his place for Arsenal's third match.\n\nLehmann subsequently had to wait nearly four months to make another competitive appearance for Arsenal, which came in their final Champions League group match against [[FC Steaua Bucure\u015fti|Steaua Bucharest]].

Due to Almunia catching flu straight after the injury, Lehmann kept his place in goal for the following three matches in February, including the first leg of the UEFA Champions League round of 16 against Milan, but also the 4\u20130 loss to arch rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup.\n\nAfter another injury to Almunia in early April 2008, Lehmann was back in goal for the away game against Manchester United on 13 April 2008. Arsenal lost that game 2\u20131, virtually ending their Premier League title hopes for the season, their third consecutive season without a major trophy. There was speculation that would be his last game for Arsenal, but on 19 April Lehmann played in the home game against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], which Arsenal won 2\u20130. The following week, \u0141ukasz Fabia\u0144ski was given his Premier League debut against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and Almunia returned to the bench for the game. However, Lehmann made another appearance and was brought on for Fabia\u0144ski in the last 20 minutes of the game against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 4 May 2008, Arsenal's final home game of the season. He was given a standing ovation after the match as he bowed and clapped to the fans.

Lehmann was in the squad  which finished as runners-up in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], but he didn't play any matches in the competition, as Kahn was still Germany's first choice goalkeeper.\n\nOn 7 April 2006, however, German national coach [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] announced that Lehmann would be Germany's first-choice goalkeeper for the upcoming [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].

Lehmann played strongly in the next three games, conceding no goals and allowing Germany to sweep their group undefeated and beat Sweden convincingly in the Round of 16.\n\nThe highlight of Lehmann's international career came in the quarterfinal match (30 June 2006, Olympiastadion, Berlin) against Argentina. The game remained tied 1\u20131 after 90 minutes and extra time. The game came down to penalty kicks and Lehmann carried his team through, picking the right direction for all spot kicks, making saves from Argentinians [[Roberto Ayala]] and [[Esteban Cambiasso]] and almost saving a third. Meanwhile, the Germans made all four of the necessary spot kicks to win the penalty shoot-out 4\u20132.

Before the last shot from Cambiasso, Lehmann looked at the paper for a long time even though Cambiasso's name was not even on it. The story about the paper features in the film ''[[Deutschland.

Lehmann was considered a hero by the German public after these saves, and he received praise even from long-time rival and backup keeper Oliver Kahn.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lehmann had penalty taker notes |work=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/germany/5136802.stm |accessdate=1 July 2006 |date=1 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nGermany's opponent in the semifinals was Italy.

The [[German Football Association]] ordered their players to wear only those manufactured by principal sponsor [[Adidas]] as opposed to Lehmann's sponsor [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. This has now been overturned thanks to Lehmann and several other players protesting about the decision and the players are now free to wear boots made by other companies.\n\nIn August 2006, Lehmann suggested that he may retire from league and international football after playing for Germany in [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lehmann plans to retire after Euro 2008 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=375850&cc=4716 |publisher=ESPNsoccernet |date=14 August 2006 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> However, he subsequently stated in January 2007 that he had not made any decision on retirement.\n\nLehmann set a national team record of not conceding a goal for 681 minutes in a friendly against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] on 26 March 2008.

He made his decision following a two-hour talk with the German national team's coach [[Joachim L\u00f6w]] and goalkeeping coach [[Andreas K\u00f6pke]], stating that he was not able to give them any guarantee that he will continue to play football following the end of his one-year contract with VfB Stuttgart in June 2009.
