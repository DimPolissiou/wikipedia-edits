His relationship with his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]] has been heavily adapted into Indian art, literature, and cinema.\n\nShah Jahan was widely considered the most competent of Emperor [[Jahangir]]'s four sons and after Jahangir's death in late 1627, when a war of succession ensued, Shah Jahan emerged victorious. He put to death all of his rivals for the throne and crowned himself emperor in January 1628 in [[Agra]] under the regnal title \"Shah Jahan\" (which was originally given to him as a princely title). Although an able military commander, Shah Jahan is perhaps best remembered for his architectural achievements. The period of his reign is widely considered the golden age of [[Mughal architecture]]. Shah Jahan commissioned many monuments, the best known of which is the [[Taj Mahal]] in Agra, which entombs his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]].\n\nIn September 1657, Shah Jahan fell seriously ill.

The name \"Khurram\" (''joyous'') was chosen for the young prince by his grandfather, Emperor [[Akbar]], with whom the young prince shared a close relationship.<ref name=\"Findly 1993 125\"/>\n\nJust prior to Khurram's birth, a soothsayer had reportedly predicted to the childless Empress [[Ruqaiya Sultan Begum]], Akbar's first wife and chief consort, that the still unborn child was destined for imperial greatness.<ref name=Faruqui>{{cite book |last=Faruqui |first=Munis D. |year=2012 |title=Princes of the Mughal Empire, 1504\u20131719 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=71 |isbn=978-1-107-02217-1}}</ref> So, when Khurram was born in 1592 and was only six days old, Akbar ordered that the prince be taken away from his mother and handed over to Ruqaiya so that he could grow up under her care, and Akbar could fulfill his wife's wish to raise a Mughal emperor.<ref name=\"Faruqui\"/> Ruqaiya assumed the primary responsibility for Khurram's upbringing and he grew up under her care.<ref>{{harvnb|Eraly|2000|p=299}}</ref> The two shared a close relationship with each other.

After Akbar's death in 1605, the young prince was allowed to return to his father's household, and thus, be closer to his biological mother.<ref name=\"Faruqui\"/>\n\n===Education===\nAs a child, Khurram received a broad education befitting his status as a Mughal prince, which included [[war|martial training]] and exposure to a wide variety of cultural arts, such as [[Persian poetry|poetry]] and [[Hindustani classical music]], most of which was inculcated, according to court chroniclers, by Akbar and Ruqaiya. In 1605, as Akbar lay on his deathbed, Khurram, who at this point was 13,<ref name=\"Qazvini\">Qazvini, Asad Beg; Mughal-era historian</ref>{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}} remained by his bedside and refused to move even after his mother tried to retrieve him. Given the politically uncertain times immediately preceding Akbar's death, Khurram was in a fair amount of physical danger from political opponents of his father,<ref>{{harvnb|Prasad|1930|p=189}} \"During his grandfather's last illness, he [Khurram] refused to leave the bedside surrounded by his enemies.

This status was given official sanction when Jahangir granted the [[sarkar (country subdivision)|sarkar]] of [[Hisar (city)|Hissar-Feroza]], which had traditionally been the fief of the heir-apparent, to Khurram in 1608.<ref>{{harvnb|Prasad|1930|p=190}} \"Khusrau conspired, rebelled, and lost the favour of his father ... Of all the sons of Jahangir, Khurram was marked out to be the heir-apparent and successor ... In 1608 the assignment of the sarkar of Hissar Firoz to him proclaimed to the world that he was intended for the throne.</ref> Nur Jahan was an intelligent and beautiful lady with an excellent educational background. She was an active participant in the decisions made by Jahangir. Slowly and gradually, she became the actual power behind the throne, as Jahangir became more indulgent in wine and opium. Coins began to be struck containing her name along with Jahangir's name. Her near and dear relatives acquired important positions in the Mughal court, termed as the Nur Jahan junta by historians. After the death of Jahangir in 1627, Nur Jahan was put under house arrest and led a quiet life.\n\n==Marriages==\n[[File:Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal.jpg|thumb|Shah Jahan and [[Mumtaz Mahal]]]]\n\nIn 1607, Khurram became engaged to Arjumand Banu Begum (1593\u20131631), who is also known as [[Mumtaz Mahal]] ([[Persian language|Persian]] for \"the chosen one of the Palace\"). They met in their youth. They were about 14 and 15 when they were engaged, and five years later they got married.  The young girl belonged to an illustrious Persian noble family that had been serving Mughal Emperors since the reign of Akbar. The family's patriarch was [[Mirza Ghiyas Beg]], who was also known by his title I'tim\u0101d-ud-Daulah or \"Pillar of the State\". He had been Jahangir's finance minister and his son, [[Asaf Khan IV|Asaf Khan]] \u2013 Arjumand Banu's father \u2013 played an important role in the Mughal court, eventually serving as Chief Minister. Her aunt was the Empress [[Nur Jahan]] and is thought to have played matchmaker in arranging the marriage.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe prince would have to wait five years before he was married in 1612 (1021 AH), on a date selected by the court astrologers as most conducive to ensuring a happy marriage. This was an unusually long engagement for the time. However, Shah Jahan first married Princess [[Kandahari Begum]], the daughter of a great-grandson of Shah [[Ismail I]] of [[Persia]] with whom he had a daughter, his first child.<ref name=\"Eraly 2000 300\">{{harvnb|Eraly|2000|p=300}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Emperor Shah Jahan, 1628.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Shah Jahan, accompanied by his three sons: [[Dara Shikoh]], [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] and [[Aurangzeb]], and their maternal grandfather [[Abul-Hasan ibn Mirza Ghiyas Beg|Asaf Khan IV]]]]\n\nPolitically speaking, the betrothal allowed Khurram to be considered as having officially entered manhood, and he was granted several jagir, including Hissar-Feroze and ennobled to a military rank of 8,000, which allowed him to take on official functions of the state, an important step in establishing his own claim to the throne.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 1612, aged 20, Khurram married Arjumand Banu Begum, who became known by the title Mumtaz Mahal, on the auspicious date chosen by court astrologers. The marriage was a happy one and Khurram remained devoted to her. She bore him fourteen children, out of whom seven survived into adulthood. In addition, Khurram had two children from his first two wives.<ref name=\"Eraly 2000 300\"/>\n\nThough there was genuine love between the two, Arjumand Banu Begum was a politically astute woman and served as a crucial advisor and confidante to her husband.<ref name=\"Eraly2000p379\">{{harvnb|Eraly|2000|p=379}}</ref> Later on, as empress, Mumtaz Mahal wielded immense power, such as being consulted by her husband in state matters and being responsible for the [[seal (device)|imperial seal]], which allowed her to review official documents in their final draft.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[File:TajMahalbyAmalMongia.jpg|thumb|The [[Taj Mahal]], the burial place of Shah Jahan and his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]]]]\n\nMumtaz Mahal died at age 38 (7 July 1631) while giving birth to [[Gauhara Begum]] in [[Burhanpur]].

But according to court chroniclers, his relationship with his other wives was more out of political consideration, and they enjoyed only the status of being royal wives.<ref name=\"Qazvini\" />\n\n==Early military campaigns==\nPrince Khurram showed extraordinary military talent. The first occasion for Khurram to test his military prowess was during the Mughal campaign against the Rajput state of [[Mewar]], which had been a hostile force to the Mughals since Akbar's reign. In 1614, commanding an army numbering around 200,000, Khurram began the campaign against Mewar.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} After a year of a harsh [[war of attrition]], Maharana Amar Singh I surrendered conditionally to the Mughal forces and became a [[vassal state]] of the Mughal Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Prasad|1930|p=239}} \"Constant skirmishes were thinning the Rajput ranks ...

Jahangir gladly and unreservedly accepted the terms.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1617, Khurram was directed to deal with the [[Lodi (Pashtun tribe)|Lodis]] in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] to secure the Empire's southern borders and to restore imperial control over the region. His successes in these campaigns led to Jahangir granting him the title of '''Shah Jahan''' (Persian: \"King of the World\") and raised his military rank and allowed him a special throne in his [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]], an unprecedented honour for a prince, thus further solidifying his status as crown prince.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}Edward S.

This often led to rebellions and wars of succession. As a result, a complex political climate surrounded the Mughal court in Khurram's formative years. In 1611 his father married Nur Jahan, the widowed daughter of a Persian noble. She rapidly became an important member of Jahangir's court and, together with her brother [[Asaf Khan IV|Asaf Khan]], wielded considerable influence. Arjumand was Asaf Khan's daughter and her marriage to Khurram consolidated Nur Jahan and Asaf Khan's positions at court.\n\nCourt intrigues, however, including Nur Jahan's decision to have her daughter from her first marriage wed Prince Khurram's youngest brother [[Shahryar (Mughal prince)|Shahzada Shahryar]] and her support for his claim to the throne led to much internal division. Prince Khurram resented the influence Nur Jahan held over his father and was angered at having to play second fiddle to her favourite Shahryar, his half-brother and her son-in-law. When the Persians besieged Kandahar, Nur Jahan was at the helm of the affairs. She ordered Prince Khurram to march for Kandahar, but he refused. As a result of Prince Khurram's refusal to obey Nur Jahan's orders, Kandahar was lost to the Persians after a forty-five-day siege.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Prince Khurram feared that in his absence Nur Jahan would attempt to poison his father against him and convince Jahangir to name Shahryar the heir in his place. This fear brought Prince Khurram to rebel against his father rather than fight against the Persians. In 1622 Prince Khurram raised an army with the support of [[Mahabat Khan]] and marched against his father and Nur Jahan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}. He was defeated at Bilochpur in March 1623. Later he took refuge in Udaipur Mewar with Maharaja [[Karan Singh II]] . He was first lodged in Delwada Ki Haveli and subsequently shifted to Jagmandir Palace on his request. Prince Khurram exchanged his turban with maharana and that turban is still preserved in [[Pratap Museum]], [[Udaipur]].(R V Somani 1976). It is believed that the mosaic work of Jagmandir inspired him to use mosaic work in the Taj Mahal of Agra.\nHis rebellion did not succeed and Khurram was forced to submit unconditionally. Although the prince was forgiven for his errors in 1626, tensions between Nur Jahan and her stepson continued to grow beneath the surface.\n\nUpon the death of Jahangir in 1627, the wazir Asaf Khan, who had long been a quiet partisan of Prince Khurram, acted with unexpected forcefulness and determination to forestall his sister the empress Nur Jahan's plans to place Prince Shahryar on the throne. He put Nur Jahan in close confinement. He obtained control of Prince Khurram's three sons who were under her care. Asaf Khan also managed palace intrigues to ensure Prince Khurram's succession the throne.<ref>{{harvnb|Richards|1993|p=117}}</ref> Prince Khurram succeeded to the Mughal throne as Abu ud-Muzaffar Shihab ud-Din Mohammad Sahib ud-Quiran ud-Thani Shah Jahan Padshah Ghazi (Urdu: \u0634\u0647\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062e\u0631\u0645), or Shah Jahan.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicoll|2009|p=157}}</ref>\n\nHis regnal name is divided into various parts.

He was also ''Khalifat Panahi'' (\"Refuge of the Caliphate\"), but ''Zill-i Allahi'', or the \"Shadow of God on Earth\".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nHis first act as ruler was to execute his chief rivals and imprison his stepmother Nur Jahan.

Upon learning of his assumption of the regency, his younger brothers, [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shuja]], Viceroy of Bengal, and [[Murad Baksh]], Viceroy of Gujarat, declared their independence and marched upon Agra in order to claim their riches. Aurangzeb, the third son, gathered a well-trained army and became its chief commander. He faced Dara's army near Agra and defeated him during the [[Battle of Samugarh]]. Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb declared him incompetent to rule and put him under [[house arrest]] in Agra Fort.\n\n[[Jahanara Begum Sahib]], Mumtaz Mahal's first daughter, voluntarily shared his 8-year confinement and nursed him in his dotage. In January 1666, Shah Jahan fell ill. Confined to bed, he became progressively weaker until, on 22 January, he commended the ladies of the imperial court, particularly his consort of later years Akbarabadi Mahal, to the care of Jahanara. After reciting the [[Shahadah|''Kal'ma'']] (''Laa ilaaha ill allah'') and verses from the [[Quran]], Shah Jahan died, aged 74.\n\nShah Jahan's chaplain [[Sayyid Muhammad Qanauji]] and Kazi Qurban of Agra came to the fort, moved his body to a nearby hall, washed it, enshrouded it and put it in a coffin of sandalwood.<ref name=\"Eraly2000p379\" />\n\nPrincess Jahanara had planned a state funeral which was to include a procession with Shah Jahan's body carried by eminent nobles followed by the notable citizens of Agra and officials scattering coins for the poor and needy.

His relationship with his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]] has been heavily adapted into Indian art, literature, and cinema.\n\nShah Jahan was widely considered the most competent of Emperor [[Jahangir]]'s four sons and after Jahangir's death in late 1627, when a war of succession ensued, Shah Jahan emerged victorious. He put to death all of his rivals for the throne and crowned himself emperor in January 1628 in [[Agra]] under the regnal title \"Shah Jahan\" (which was originally given to him as a princely title). Although an able military commander, Shah Jahan is perhaps best remembered for his architectural achievements. The period of his reign is widely considered the golden age of [[Mughal architecture]]. Shah Jahan commissioned many monuments, the best known of which is the [[Taj Mahal]] in Agra, which entombs his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]].\n\nIn September 1657, Shah Jahan fell seriously ill.

The name \"Khurram\" (''joyous'') was chosen for the young prince by his grandfather, Emperor [[Akbar]], with whom the young prince shared a close relationship.<ref name=\"Findly 1993 125\"/>\n\nJust prior to Khurram's birth, a soothsayer had reportedly predicted to the childless Empress [[Ruqaiya Sultan Begum]], Akbar's first wife and chief consort, that the still unborn child was destined for imperial greatness.<ref name=Faruqui>{{cite book |last=Faruqui |first=Munis D. |year=2012 |title=Princes of the Mughal Empire, 1504\u20131719 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=71 |isbn=978-1-107-02217-1}}</ref> So, when Khurram was born in 1592 and was only six days old, Akbar ordered that the prince be taken away from his mother and handed over to Ruqaiya so that he could grow up under her care, and Akbar could fulfill his wife's wish to raise a Mughal emperor.<ref name=\"Faruqui\"/> Ruqaiya assumed the primary responsibility for Khurram's upbringing and he grew up under her care.<ref>{{harvnb|Eraly|2000|p=299}}</ref> The two shared a close relationship with each other.

After Akbar's death in 1605, the young prince was allowed to return to his father's household, and thus, be closer to his biological mother.<ref name=\"Faruqui\"/>\n\n===Education===\nAs a child, Khurram received a broad education befitting his status as a Mughal prince, which included [[war|martial training]] and exposure to a wide variety of cultural arts, such as [[Persian poetry|poetry]] and [[Hindustani classical music]], most of which was inculcated, according to court chroniclers, by Akbar and Ruqaiya. In 1605, as Akbar lay on his deathbed, Khurram, who at this point was 13,<ref name=\"Qazvini\">Qazvini, Asad Beg; Mughal-era historian</ref>{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}} remained by his bedside and refused to move even after his mother tried to retrieve him. Given the politically uncertain times immediately preceding Akbar's death, Khurram was in a fair amount of physical danger from political opponents of his father,<ref>{{harvnb|Prasad|1930|p=189}} \"During his grandfather's last illness, he [Khurram] refused to leave the bedside surrounded by his enemies. Neither the advice of his father nor the entreaties of his mother could prevail on him to prefer the safety of his life to his last duty to the old man.\"</ref> His conduct at this time can be understood as a precursor to the bravery that he would later be known for.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Khusrau rebellion===\nIn 1605, his father succeeded to the throne, after crushing a rebellion by [[Khusrau Mirza|Prince Khusrau]] \u2013 Khurram remained distant from court politics and intrigues in the immediate aftermath of that event, which was apparently a conscious decision on Jahangir's part.<ref>Jahangir, Tuzk-e-Jahangiri; The Emperor's memoirs</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} As the third son, Khurram did not challenge the two major power blocs of the time, his father's and his step-brother's; thus, he enjoyed the benefits of imperial protection and luxury while being allowed to continue with his education and training.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicoll|2009|p=56}}</ref> This relatively quiet and stable period of his life allowed Khurram to build his own support base in the Mughal court, which would be useful later on in his life.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Nur Jahan===\nDue to the long period of tensions between his father and step-brother, Khurram began to drift closer to his father and over time started to be considered the de facto heir-apparent by court chroniclers. This status was given official sanction when Jahangir granted the [[sarkar (country subdivision)|sarkar]] of [[Hisar (city)|Hissar-Feroza]], which had traditionally been the fief of the heir-apparent, to Khurram in 1608.<ref>{{harvnb|Prasad|1930|p=190}} \"Khusrau conspired, rebelled, and lost the favour of his father ... Of all the sons of Jahangir, Khurram was marked out to be the heir-apparent and successor ... In 1608 the assignment of the sarkar of Hissar Firoz to him proclaimed to the world that he was intended for the throne.</ref> Nur Jahan was an intelligent and beautiful lady with an excellent educational background. She was an active participant in the decisions made by Jahangir. Slowly and gradually, she became the actual power behind the throne, as Jahangir became more indulgent in wine and opium. Coins began to be struck containing her name along with Jahangir's name. Her near and dear relatives acquired important positions in the Mughal court, termed as the Nur Jahan junta by historians. After the death of Jahangir in 1627, Nur Jahan was put under house arrest and led a quiet life.\n\n==Marriages==\n[[File:Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal.jpg|thumb|Shah Jahan and [[Mumtaz Mahal]]]]\n\nIn 1607, Khurram became engaged to Arjumand Banu Begum (1593\u20131631), who is also known as [[Mumtaz Mahal]] ([[Persian language|Persian]] for \"the chosen one of the Palace\"). They met in their youth. They were about 14 and 15 when they were engaged, and five years later they got married.  The young girl belonged to an illustrious Persian noble family that had been serving Mughal Emperors since the reign of Akbar. The family's patriarch was [[Mirza Ghiyas Beg]], who was also known by his title I'tim\u0101d-ud-Daulah or \"Pillar of the State\". He had been Jahangir's finance minister and his son, [[Asaf Khan IV|Asaf Khan]] \u2013 Arjumand Banu's father \u2013 played an important role in the Mughal court, eventually serving as Chief Minister. Her aunt was the Empress [[Nur Jahan]] and is thought to have played matchmaker in arranging the marriage.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe prince would have to wait five years before he was married in 1612 (1021 AH), on a date selected by the court astrologers as most conducive to ensuring a happy marriage. This was an unusually long engagement for the time. However, Shah Jahan first married Princess [[Kandahari Begum]], the daughter of a great-grandson of Shah [[Ismail I]] of [[Persia]] with whom he had a daughter, his first child.<ref name=\"Eraly 2000 300\">{{harvnb|Eraly|2000|p=300}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Emperor Shah Jahan, 1628.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Shah Jahan, accompanied by his three sons: [[Dara Shikoh]], [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] and [[Aurangzeb]], and their maternal grandfather [[Abul-Hasan ibn Mirza Ghiyas Beg|Asaf Khan IV]]]]\n\nPolitically speaking, the betrothal allowed Khurram to be considered as having officially entered manhood, and he was granted several jagir, including Hissar-Feroze and ennobled to a military rank of 8,000, which allowed him to take on official functions of the state, an important step in establishing his own claim to the throne.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn 1612, aged 20, Khurram married Arjumand Banu Begum, who became known by the title Mumtaz Mahal, on the auspicious date chosen by court astrologers. The marriage was a happy one and Khurram remained devoted to her. She bore him fourteen children, out of whom seven survived into adulthood. In addition, Khurram had two children from his first two wives.<ref name=\"Eraly 2000 300\"/>\n\nThough there was genuine love between the two, Arjumand Banu Begum was a politically astute woman and served as a crucial advisor and confidante to her husband.<ref name=\"Eraly2000p379\">{{harvnb|Eraly|2000|p=379}}</ref> Later on, as empress, Mumtaz Mahal wielded immense power, such as being consulted by her husband in state matters and being responsible for the [[seal (device)|imperial seal]], which allowed her to review official documents in their final draft.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[File:TajMahalbyAmalMongia.jpg|thumb|The [[Taj Mahal]], the burial place of Shah Jahan and his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]]]]\n\nMumtaz Mahal died at age 38 (7 July 1631) while giving birth to [[Gauhara Begum]] in [[Burhanpur]].

Her death had a profound impact on Shah Jahan's personality and inspired the construction of the [[Taj Mahal]], where she was later reburied.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn the intervening years Khurram had taken eight other wives, among which [[Kandahari Begum]] (m. 12 December 1609) and [[Izz un-Nisa Begum]] (m. 3 September 1617), the daughters of Muzaffar Husain Mirza Safawi and Shahnawaz Khan, son of [[Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana]], respectively. But according to court chroniclers, his relationship with his other wives was more out of political consideration, and they enjoyed only the status of being royal wives.<ref name=\"Qazvini\" />\n\n==Early military campaigns==\nPrince Khurram showed extraordinary military talent. The first occasion for Khurram to test his military prowess was during the Mughal campaign against the Rajput state of [[Mewar]], which had been a hostile force to the Mughals since Akbar's reign. In 1614, commanding an army numbering around 200,000, Khurram began the campaign against Mewar.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} After a year of a harsh [[war of attrition]], Maharana Amar Singh I surrendered conditionally to the Mughal forces and became a [[vassal state]] of the Mughal Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Prasad|1930|p=239}} \"Constant skirmishes were thinning the Rajput ranks ... [Amar Singh] offered to recognize Mughal supremacy ... Jahangir gladly and unreservedly accepted the terms.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1617, Khurram was directed to deal with the [[Lodi (Pashtun tribe)|Lodis]] in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] to secure the Empire's southern borders and to restore imperial control over the region. His successes in these campaigns led to Jahangir granting him the title of '''Shah Jahan''' (Persian: \"King of the World\") and raised his military rank and allowed him a special throne in his [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]], an unprecedented honour for a prince, thus further solidifying his status as crown prince.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}Edward S.

This often led to rebellions and wars of succession. As a result, a complex political climate surrounded the Mughal court in Khurram's formative years. In 1611 his father married Nur Jahan, the widowed daughter of a Persian noble. She rapidly became an important member of Jahangir's court and, together with her brother [[Asaf Khan IV|Asaf Khan]], wielded considerable influence. Arjumand was Asaf Khan's daughter and her marriage to Khurram consolidated Nur Jahan and Asaf Khan's positions at court.\n\nCourt intrigues, however, including Nur Jahan's decision to have her daughter from her first marriage wed Prince Khurram's youngest brother [[Shahryar (Mughal prince)|Shahzada Shahryar]] and her support for his claim to the throne led to much internal division. Prince Khurram resented the influence Nur Jahan held over his father and was angered at having to play second fiddle to her favourite Shahryar, his half-brother and her son-in-law. When the Persians besieged Kandahar, Nur Jahan was at the helm of the affairs. She ordered Prince Khurram to march for Kandahar, but he refused. As a result of Prince Khurram's refusal to obey Nur Jahan's orders, Kandahar was lost to the Persians after a forty-five-day siege.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Prince Khurram feared that in his absence Nur Jahan would attempt to poison his father against him and convince Jahangir to name Shahryar the heir in his place. This fear brought Prince Khurram to rebel against his father rather than fight against the Persians. In 1622 Prince Khurram raised an army with the support of [[Mahabat Khan]] and marched against his father and Nur Jahan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}. He was defeated at Bilochpur in March 1623. Later he took refuge in Udaipur Mewar with Maharaja [[Karan Singh II]] . He was first lodged in Delwada Ki Haveli and subsequently shifted to Jagmandir Palace on his request. Prince Khurram exchanged his turban with maharana and that turban is still preserved in [[Pratap Museum]], [[Udaipur]].(R V Somani 1976). It is believed that the mosaic work of Jagmandir inspired him to use mosaic work in the Taj Mahal of Agra.\nHis rebellion did not succeed and Khurram was forced to submit unconditionally. Although the prince was forgiven for his errors in 1626, tensions between Nur Jahan and her stepson continued to grow beneath the surface.\n\nUpon the death of Jahangir in 1627, the wazir Asaf Khan, who had long been a quiet partisan of Prince Khurram, acted with unexpected forcefulness and determination to forestall his sister the empress Nur Jahan's plans to place Prince Shahryar on the throne.

Upon learning of his assumption of the regency, his younger brothers, [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shuja]], Viceroy of Bengal, and [[Murad Baksh]], Viceroy of Gujarat, declared their independence and marched upon Agra in order to claim their riches. Aurangzeb, the third son, gathered a well-trained army and became its chief commander. He faced Dara's army near Agra and defeated him during the [[Battle of Samugarh]]. Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb declared him incompetent to rule and put him under [[house arrest]] in Agra Fort.\n\n[[Jahanara Begum Sahib]], Mumtaz Mahal's first daughter, voluntarily shared his 8-year confinement and nursed him in his dotage. In January 1666, Shah Jahan fell ill.

Some propose this is simply for dramatic effect so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.<ref name=\"Isaacson239\">Isaacson 2017, pp. 239</ref>\n\n===The Musical Score===\n\nThe folded piece of paper is held in an odd and stiff way holds and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.<ref name=\"Kemp\"/> Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are larly illegible.<ref name=\"Brown\"/> This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\u201376\"/> The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.<ref name=\"Ambrosiana\"/> The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].<ref name=\"Fagnart73\"/> But since comparisons of Leonardo's notation of music from drawings{{#tag:ref|Drawings that are kept in the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]], to be exact.|group=n}} does not resemble that of the painting, he is probably not the author, leaving the author and the significance of the music, unknown.<ref name=\"Bambach\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Attribution and Date===\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.<ref name=\"Oxford Art\">{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000050401 |author=Kemp, Martin |title=Leonardo da Vinci |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Pedretti\">Pedretti 1989, pp. 68</ref><ref name=\"Brown\">Brown 1983, pp. 105</ref> This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,<ref name=\"Kemp\">Kemp 2019, pp.92</ref> something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso to have been done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]]<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark 1989</ref> or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].<ref name=\"Palmer\"/><ref name=\"Universal\"/> But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.<ref name=\"Isaacson238\"/>\n\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,<ref name=\"Isaacson238\"/> this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Pedretti\" /> The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].<ref name=\"Oxford Art\"/> The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1489, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1489. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1898.<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Fagnart74\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 74</ref>\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to stay in Milan and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. The portrait beared the description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> The theory was that it was counterpart with the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but was thought to be a portrait by Leonardo, of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> These assumptions were taken to be true without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding some kind of [[sheet music|musical score]],<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> which lead to the identification of the subject as a musician.<ref name=\"Z\u00f6llner45\"/> Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.<ref name=\"Pooler32\">Pooler 2014, pp. 32</ref>\n\n==Possible Subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.<ref name=\"Pooler31\">Pooler 2014, pp. 31</ref> Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This has been suggested to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> The issues that have since discredited this theory are the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no portraits from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> As well as, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to have been the young subject of the painting.<ref name=\"Gaffurius Grove\"/><ref>Pooler 2014, pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\n\nSince Pietro C.

She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{#tag:ref|With Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix'' suggested as a piece that exemplifies this.|group=n}}<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> This theory has since been strongly discredited due to the notation in the painting being largely illegible and the fact of many composers of the time writing the same forms in the same manner that was suggested to indicate specifically Josquin.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues\nas that of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making it unlikely to be him, a young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]], in the ''Portrait of a Musician''.<ref name=\"Josquin\"/>\n\n===Gaspar Van Weerbeke===\n\nLaure Fagnart suggested most recently in 2019 that the sitter's identity is, [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, where they likely knew each other due to their shared employer.<ref name=\"Fagnart76\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 76</ref> This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.<ref name= Fagnart76/>\n\n===Other Candidates===\n\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freeart.com/artwork/art-print/leonardo-da-vinci-portrait-of-unknown_fan22837019.html |title=Leonardo da Vinci, portrait of unknown musician, perhaps Franchino Gaffurio or Galeazzo di Sanseverino.

Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1489, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1489. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1898.<ref name=\"Clark\"/><ref name=\"Fagnart74\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 74</ref>\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to stay in Milan and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. The portrait beared the description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> The theory was that it was counterpart with the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but was thought to be a portrait by Leonardo, of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> These assumptions were taken to be true without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding some kind of [[sheet music|musical score]],<ref name=\"Fagnart74\"/> which lead to the identification of the subject as a musician.<ref name=\"Z\u00f6llner45\"/> Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.<ref name=\"Pooler32\">Pooler 2014, pp. 32</ref>\n\n==Possible Subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.<ref name=\"Pooler31\">Pooler 2014, pp. 31</ref> Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This has been suggested to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.<ref name=\"Silvestri\"/> The issues that have since discredited this theory are the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no portraits from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> As well as, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to have been the young subject of the painting.<ref name=\"Gaffurius Grove\"/><ref>Pooler 2014, pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\n\nSince Pietro C.

She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{#tag:ref|With Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix'' suggested as a piece that exemplifies this.|group=n}}<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> This theory has since been strongly discredited due to the notation in the painting being largely illegible and the fact of many composers of the time writing the same forms in the same manner that was suggested to indicate specifically Josquin.<ref name=\"Fagnart75\"/> Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues\nas that of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making it unlikely to be him, a young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]], in the ''Portrait of a Musician''.<ref name=\"Josquin\"/>\n\n===Gaspar Van Weerbeke===\n\nLaure Fagnart suggested most recently in 2019 that the sitter's identity is, [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, where they likely knew each other due to their shared employer.<ref name=\"Fagnart76\">Fagnart 2019, pp. 76</ref> This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.<ref name= Fagnart76/>\n\n===Other Candidates===\n\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan.
