After initially being sent to blockade Havana itself, Sampson was given orders to intercept Admiral Cervera's squadron, but with only a vague notion of Cervera's current location, he was unable to actively pursue. Awaiting further information on Cervera's whereabouts, Sampson sailed east to San Juan and carried out a bombardment on May 10 that lasted several days, dealing minor infrastructural damage to the city. After this preliminary bombardment, Sampson helped lead a land-sea attack on San Juan, along with General [[William Rufus Shafter|William Shafter]], taking the city. On July 1, following the successful invasion, Sampson returned to Cuba, reinforcing the blockades in Santiago and Cienfuegos.\n\nOn May 29, elements of Sampson's command spotted Admiral Cervera's squadron moving into Santiago harbor and the naval presence there was greatly increased to prevent Cervera's escape.

The next day, Rear Admiral Sampson sent his famous message: \"The Fleet under my command offers the nation as a Fourth of July present, the whole of Cervera's Fleet\".\n\nSampson's message omitted any mention of Schley's leadership in the battle, leading to a controversy as to who was responsible for the victory. While Sampson also arguably played a significant role in the victory, having laid down the strategic framework and determining the favorable positions of his own forces, it was of course Schley who had actually commanded the fleet during the battle.<ref name=\"wb\" /> Schley appealed for a court of inquiry, which he got in 1901.

He became Commandant of the [[Boston Navy Yard]] in October 1899 and transferred to the Retired List on February 9, 1902.\n\nSampson was a companion of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]] and the [[Military Order of Foreign Wars]].

After graduating first in his class four years later, he served as an instructor at the Academy, teaching physics.<ref name=\"wb\" /> In 1864, he became the [[executive officer]] of the [[monitor warship type|monitor]] {{USS|Patapsco|1862|2}} of the [[Union blockade|South Atlantic Blockading Squadron]] and engaged in sweeping [[Naval mine#19th century|torpedo]]es off [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. He survived the loss of that ironclad on January 15, 1865, when she struck a torpedo, exploded, and sank with a loss of 75&nbsp;lives.\n\nFollowing duty on the [[steam frigate]] {{USS|Colorado|1856|2}} with the [[European Squadron]], another tour as instructor at the Naval Academy, and in the [[Bureau of Navigation]] of the [[Navy Department]], he served in the [[screw sloop]] {{USS|Congress|1868|2}}. He then commanded the {{USS|Alert|1861|2}}, the training ship {{USS|Mayflower|1866|2}}, and the {{USS|Swatara|1873|2}} while on duty at the Naval Academy.\n\nDuring the next years, he was Assistant to the Superintendent of the [[United States Naval Observatory]], then Officer-in-Charge of the [[Naval Torpedo Station]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. On September 9, 1886, he became Superintendent of the Naval Academy. He was promoted to [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] on April 9, 1889, reported to the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]] to fit out the [[protected cruiser]] {{USS|San Francisco|C-5|2}}, and assumed command when she was commissioned on November 15, 1889. He was detached in June 1892 to serve as Inspector of Ordnance in the [[Washington Navy Yard]] and was appointed Chief of the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] on January 28, 1893. He assumed command of the [[battleship]] {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|2}} on June 15, 1897. On February 17, 1898, he was made President of the Board of Inquiry to investigate the destruction of the {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|2}}.

Upon hatching, they cause a lot of damage to the host plant by eating away at and destroying the host plant.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Caterpillars and eggs of Large White butterfly - geograph.org.uk - 1009228.jpg|thumb|Eggs and newly hatched caterpillars]]\n[[File:Pieris brassicae (caterpillar).jpg|thumb|Caterpillar]]\n[[File:Pieris brassicae (caterpillar) Portrait.jpg|thumb|Caterpillar]]\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Migration===\nThe large whites are found throughout most of [[Eurasia]], though there are some seasonal fluctuations present due to migration. The northern populations tend to be augmented during the summer migration season from butterflies from southern areas. The large whites fly starting early spring, and keep migrating until seasons shift to autumn and the resultant cold weather. This means the large whites typically take two to three flights per butterfly reproductive season.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n\nLarge white butterfly migration patterns are typically observed only when there is a disturbance. In general, the large white butterfly's migratory patterns are atypical; normally, butterflies fly towards the poles in the spring, and towards the more temperate [[Equator]] during the fall. However, they fly in random directions, excluding north, in the spring, and there is little return migration observed.<ref name=\":4\">Feltwell, John. Large White Butterfly: The Biology, Biochemistry, and Physiology of Pieris Brassicae (Linnaeus). The Hague: W. Junk, 1982. Print.</ref> However, it has been hard to track entire migratory paths, since these butterflies can migrate more than 800 kilometres; thus, individual butterflies may not migrate the 800 kilometres, but rather that other butterflies start their migrations from where the other butterflies ended.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Hibernation===\nLarge white broods in the north have not been seen to [[Overwintering|overwinter]], or hibernate over the winter, successfully. However, they have been observed to hibernate in the south.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>Pullin, A. S., J. S. Bale, and X. L. R. Fontaine. \"Physiological Aspects of Diapause and Cold Tolerance during Overwintering in Pieris Brassicae.\" Physiological Entomology 16.4 (1991): 447-56. Print.</ref>\n\n===Territorial behaviour===\nMales do not display considerable amounts of territorial behaviour. It has been suggested that this could be a reason why there is no observed significant [[sexual dimorphism]] between the male and female large white butterflies.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Diet and food selection===\n\nLarge white butterflies have a preference for what types of food plant they usually eat. Studies have shown that the preference for certain plants is reliant upon the butterflies' previous experiences. The large white butterflies, then, are shown to rely on the species of food plants, the time of experience, and the choice-situation. Thus, the large white butterflies learn what types of foods they prefer, rather than relying on their sense organs or physiological changes.<ref name=\":3\" /> In contrast, this preference for adult food plant differs from the preference of female large whites using visual cues such as plant colour to determine the best host plants for oviposition.<ref name=\":5\" />\n \nPlants with [[Glucosinolate|mustard-oil glucosides]] are important for this butterfly because it dictates their eating behaviours,<ref name=\":3\" /> and resultant survival rates, as specified in the section regarding oviposition. This is so beneficial for large whites because their large consumption of plants containing mustard oils is the specific reason they are so distasteful to predators, such as birds. Thus, caterpillars are protected from attack, despite them being brightly coloured; in fact, the bright colouration is to signal to predators that they taste bad.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> \n \nHowever, there is more benefit to this species' use of mustard oil glucosides. In addition to predator protection, these glucosides belong to a class of stimuli that produce the biting responses associated with eating. Some plants contain [[alkaloid]]s and [[steroid]]s; these reduce and inhibit the butterflies' responsiveness to mustard oil glucosides. Thus, this utilization of mustard oil glucosides dramatically affects the behaviour of the butterfly, and the resulting food selection for survival.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe food source of the larva of the white butterfly are cabbages, radishes, and the undersides of leaves. Adults feed on flower [[nectar]].\n\n===Predators===\nLarge white butterflies do not have a specific group of predators. Instead, they are preyed upon by a wide range of animals, and even the occasional plant. This butterfly's main predators include birds; however, large whites can also be preyed upon by species in orders such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[Hemiptera]], [[Coleoptera]], [[Diptera]], [[Arachnid]]; some species of [[mammal]]s, one of [[reptile]]s, one species of [[insectivorous plant]], and species in [[amphibian]] orders, as well as other miscellaneous insect species. The butterflies are typically preyed upon as eggs, larvae, and imagines.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Aposematism===\nLarge white butterflies emit an unpleasant smell which deters predators. In addition, large whites are an [[aposematic]] species, meaning that they display warning colours, which benefits the large whites against predation. This aposematic colouration occurs in the [[larval]], [[pupal]], and [[imago]] stages, where toxic mustard oil glycosides from food plants are stored in the individuals' bodies.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=aposem2>{{cite journal|last=Lyytinen|first=Anne|author2=Alatalo, Rauno V. |author3=Lindstr\u00f6m, Leena |author4= Mappes, Johanna |title=Are European White Butterflies Aposematic?|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|date=November 1999|volume=13|issue=7/8|pages=709\u2013719|doi=10.1023/A:1011081800202|url=http://users.jyu.fi/~mappes/publications/Lyytinen_etal_01_evoeco.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> Aposematism is not entirely related to [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]]; however, large white larvae often benefit from multiple other aposematic larvae from other species, such as the larvae of ''[[Papilio machaon]]''.<ref name=aposematism>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=edited by David L.|title=Insect defenses: adaptive mechanisms and strategies of prey and predators|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791406168|pages=182\u2013183|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jpxkhS7O0p0C&pg=PA175&dq=pieris+brassicae+mullerian+mimicry#v=snippet&q=brassicae&f=false|author2=Schmidt, Justin O.}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship to people==\n\n===Role as pests===\nThe crops most susceptible to ''P. brassicae'' damage in areas in Europe are those in the genus ''[[Brassica]]'' ([[cabbage]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], and their allies), particularly [[Brussels sprout]]s, [[cabbage]], [[cauliflower]], [[kohlrabi]], [[Rapeseed|rape]], [[Rutabaga|swede]], and [[turnip]]. The attacks to crops are rather localized and can lead to 100% crop loss in a certain area. In addition, because of its strong inclination to migrate, adults may infest new areas that were previously free from attack. Because many of the host plants of ''P. brassicae'' are sold for consumption, damage by these butterflies can cause a great reduction of crop value. Larvae may also bore into the vegetable heads of cabbage and cauliflower and cause damage. High populations of these larvae may also skeletonise their host plants. In present-day areas such as Great Britain, ''P. brassicae'' are now less threatening as pests because of natural and chemical control reasons. However, it is still considered a pest in other European countries, in China, India, Nepal, and Russia. In fact, it is estimated to cause over 40% yield loss annually on different crop vegetables in India and Turkey.<ref name=purdue>{{cite web|title=Pieris brassicae|url=http://caps.ceris.purdue.edu/webfm_send/1177|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Subspecies==\n* ''Pieris brassicae azorensis'' \n* ''Pieris brassicae brassicae''\n* ''Pieris brassicae ottonis''\n* ''[[Pieris brassicae wollastoni]]'' [[extinction | \u2020]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Madeiran large white]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|26em}}\n{{Commons category|position=left|Pieris brassicae}}\n{{Wikispecies|Pieris brassicae}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q26764}}\n\n[[Category:Pieris (butterfly)|brassicae]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Africa]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Asia]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Europe]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of India]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Iran]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Butterflies described in 1758]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pest insects]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the breed of swine|Large White pig}}\n{{Italic title}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2016}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| name = Large white\n| image = Large White.

The females can pair up to mate again approximately five or more days after the previous mating.<ref name=\":5\">W. A. L. David and B. O. C. Gardiner (1962).

They favour green surfaces in particular to display [[oviposition]] behaviour.

Upon hatching, they cause a lot of damage to the host plant by eating away at and destroying the host plant.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Caterpillars and eggs of Large White butterfly - geograph.org.uk - 1009228.jpg|thumb|Eggs and newly hatched caterpillars]]\n[[File:Pieris brassicae (caterpillar).jpg|thumb|Caterpillar]]\n[[File:Pieris brassicae (caterpillar) Portrait.jpg|thumb|Caterpillar]]\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Migration===\nThe large whites are found throughout most of [[Eurasia]], though there are some seasonal fluctuations present due to migration. The northern populations tend to be augmented during the summer migration season from butterflies from southern areas. The large whites fly starting early spring, and keep migrating until seasons shift to autumn and the resultant cold weather. This means the large whites typically take two to three flights per butterfly reproductive season.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n\nLarge white butterfly migration patterns are typically observed only when there is a disturbance. In general, the large white butterfly's migratory patterns are atypical; normally, butterflies fly towards the poles in the spring, and towards the more temperate [[Equator]] during the fall. However, they fly in random directions, excluding north, in the spring, and there is little return migration observed.<ref name=\":4\">Feltwell, John. Large White Butterfly: The Biology, Biochemistry, and Physiology of Pieris Brassicae (Linnaeus). The Hague: W. Junk, 1982. Print.</ref> However, it has been hard to track entire migratory paths, since these butterflies can migrate more than 800 kilometres; thus, individual butterflies may not migrate the 800 kilometres, but rather that other butterflies start their migrations from where the other butterflies ended.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Hibernation===\nLarge white broods in the north have not been seen to [[Overwintering|overwinter]], or hibernate over the winter, successfully. However, they have been observed to hibernate in the south.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>Pullin, A. S., J. S. Bale, and X. L. R. Fontaine. \"Physiological Aspects of Diapause and Cold Tolerance during Overwintering in Pieris Brassicae.\" Physiological Entomology 16.4 (1991): 447-56. Print.</ref>\n\n===Territorial behaviour===\nMales do not display considerable amounts of territorial behaviour. It has been suggested that this could be a reason why there is no observed significant [[sexual dimorphism]] between the male and female large white butterflies.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Diet and food selection===\n\nLarge white butterflies have a preference for what types of food plant they usually eat. Studies have shown that the preference for certain plants is reliant upon the butterflies' previous experiences. The large white butterflies, then, are shown to rely on the species of food plants, the time of experience, and the choice-situation. Thus, the large white butterflies learn what types of foods they prefer, rather than relying on their sense organs or physiological changes.<ref name=\":3\" /> In contrast, this preference for adult food plant differs from the preference of female large whites using visual cues such as plant colour to determine the best host plants for oviposition.<ref name=\":5\" />\n \nPlants with [[Glucosinolate|mustard-oil glucosides]] are important for this butterfly because it dictates their eating behaviours,<ref name=\":3\" /> and resultant survival rates, as specified in the section regarding oviposition. This is so beneficial for large whites because their large consumption of plants containing mustard oils is the specific reason they are so distasteful to predators, such as birds. Thus, caterpillars are protected from attack, despite them being brightly coloured; in fact, the bright colouration is to signal to predators that they taste bad.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> \n \nHowever, there is more benefit to this species' use of mustard oil glucosides. In addition to predator protection, these glucosides belong to a class of stimuli that produce the biting responses associated with eating. Some plants contain [[alkaloid]]s and [[steroid]]s; these reduce and inhibit the butterflies' responsiveness to mustard oil glucosides. Thus, this utilization of mustard oil glucosides dramatically affects the behaviour of the butterfly, and the resulting food selection for survival.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe food source of the larva of the white butterfly are cabbages, radishes, and the undersides of leaves. Adults feed on flower [[nectar]].\n\n===Predators===\nLarge white butterflies do not have a specific group of predators. Instead, they are preyed upon by a wide range of animals, and even the occasional plant. This butterfly's main predators include birds; however, large whites can also be preyed upon by species in orders such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[Hemiptera]], [[Coleoptera]], [[Diptera]], [[Arachnid]]; some species of [[mammal]]s, one of [[reptile]]s, one species of [[insectivorous plant]], and species in [[amphibian]] orders, as well as other miscellaneous insect species. The butterflies are typically preyed upon as eggs, larvae, and imagines.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Aposematism===\nLarge white butterflies emit an unpleasant smell which deters predators. In addition, large whites are an [[aposematic]] species, meaning that they display warning colours, which benefits the large whites against predation. This aposematic colouration occurs in the [[larval]], [[pupal]], and [[imago]] stages, where toxic mustard oil glycosides from food plants are stored in the individuals' bodies.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=aposem2>{{cite journal|last=Lyytinen|first=Anne|author2=Alatalo, Rauno V. |author3=Lindstr\u00f6m, Leena |author4= Mappes, Johanna |title=Are European White Butterflies Aposematic?|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|date=November 1999|volume=13|issue=7/8|pages=709\u2013719|doi=10.1023/A:1011081800202|url=http://users.jyu.fi/~mappes/publications/Lyytinen_etal_01_evoeco.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> Aposematism is not entirely related to [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]]; however, large white larvae often benefit from multiple other aposematic larvae from other species, such as the larvae of ''[[Papilio machaon]]''.<ref name=aposematism>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=edited by David L.|title=Insect defenses: adaptive mechanisms and strategies of prey and predators|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791406168|pages=182\u2013183|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jpxkhS7O0p0C&pg=PA175&dq=pieris+brassicae+mullerian+mimicry#v=snippet&q=brassicae&f=false|author2=Schmidt, Justin O.}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship to people==\n\n===Role as pests===\nThe crops most susceptible to ''P. brassicae'' damage in areas in Europe are those in the genus ''[[Brassica]]'' ([[cabbage]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], and their allies), particularly [[Brussels sprout]]s, [[cabbage]], [[cauliflower]], [[kohlrabi]], [[Rapeseed|rape]], [[Rutabaga|swede]], and [[turnip]]. The attacks to crops are rather localized and can lead to 100% crop loss in a certain area. In addition, because of its strong inclination to migrate, adults may infest new areas that were previously free from attack. Because many of the host plants of ''P. brassicae'' are sold for consumption, damage by these butterflies can cause a great reduction of crop value. Larvae may also bore into the vegetable heads of cabbage and cauliflower and cause damage. High populations of these larvae may also skeletonise their host plants. In present-day areas such as Great Britain, ''P. brassicae'' are now less threatening as pests because of natural and chemical control reasons. However, it is still considered a pest in other European countries, in China, India, Nepal, and Russia. In fact, it is estimated to cause over 40% yield loss annually on different crop vegetables in India and Turkey.<ref name=purdue>{{cite web|title=Pieris brassicae|url=http://caps.ceris.purdue.edu/webfm_send/1177|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Subspecies==\n* ''Pieris brassicae azorensis'' \n* ''Pieris brassicae brassicae''\n* ''Pieris brassicae ottonis''\n* ''[[Pieris brassicae wollastoni]]'' [[extinction | \u2020]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Madeiran large white]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|26em}}\n{{Commons category|position=left|Pieris brassicae}}\n{{Wikispecies|Pieris brassicae}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q26764}}\n\n[[Category:Pieris (butterfly)|brassicae]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Africa]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Asia]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Europe]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of India]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Iran]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Butterflies described in 1758]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pest insects]]\n", "name_user": "110.175.172.151", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eMale)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieris_brassicae"}
