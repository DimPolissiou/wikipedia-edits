Due to Guam's almost unrestricted airspace and the close proximity of the [[Farallon de Medinilla|Farallon de Medinilla Island]], a naval bombing range {{convert|184|mi|km}} north, the base is in an ideal training location.\n\n==History==\nAndersen Air Force Base was established on 3 December 1944 and is named for Brigadier General James Roy Andersen (1904\u20131945).  General Andersen graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1926, served at various army installations, and obtained his wings at [[Kelly AFB|Kelly Field]], Texas, in 1936. During 1943\u20131944 he served on the War Department General Staff. In January 1945, General Andersen was assigned to HQ AAF, Pacific Ocean Area. He died on 26 February 1945 in the crash of a [[B-24 Liberator]] aircraft between [[Kwajalein]] and [[Johnston Island]] while en route to [[Hawaii]].\n\n===World War II===\nAndersen Air Force Base's origins begin on 7 December 1941 when Guam was attacked by the armed forces of [[Imperial Japan]] in the [[Battle of Guam (1941)]] three hours after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The United States Navy surrendered Guam to the Japanese on 10 December. At the height of the war, approximately 19,000 Japanese soldiers and sailors were deployed to the island. Guam was liberated by the [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine Corps']] 3rd Amphibious Corps on 21 July 1944, in the [[Battle of Guam (1944)]], after a 13-day pre-invasion bombardment.\n\nThe Japanese managed to contain the Marines on two beachheads, but their counter-attack failed. The Marines renewed their assault, and reached the northern tip of the island on 10 August 1944.  Japanese guerrilla activities continued until the end of the war, and some were [[Japanese holdout|holdouts]] for many years afterwards.\n\nGuam was considered ideal to establish air bases to launch [[B-29 Superfortress]] operations against the [[Japanese Archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]]. The [[Marianas Islands]] are about {{convert|1500|mi|km}} from Tokyo, a range which the B-29s could just about manage. Most important of all, it could be put on a direct supply line from the United States by ship.  \"North Field,\" as Andersen AFB was first named, was the first air base built in Guam after its liberation. Its construction began in November 1944 and was supported by the [[United States Navy]] [[Seabee]]s.  North Field and its co-located [[Northwest Field (Guam)|Northwest Field]] was a massive installation, with four main runways, taxiways, [[Revetment (aircraft)|revetments]] for over 200 B-29s, and a large containment area for base operations and personnel.\n\nThe first host unit at North Field was the [[314th Air Division|314th Bombardment Wing]], [[XXI Bomber Command]], [[Twentieth Air Force]].  The 314th arrived in Guam on 16 January 1945 from Peterson Field, Colorado.  The 314th controlled four operational B-29 bomb groups, the [[19th Air Refueling Wing|19th]], (Square M), [[29th Bombardment Group|29th]] (Square O), [[39th Air Expeditionary Wing|39th]] (Square P), and [[330th Bombardment Group (VH)|330th]] (Square K).\n\nB-29 Superfortress missions from North Field were attacks against strategic targets in Japan, operating in daylight and at a high altitude to bomb factories, refineries, and other objectives. In March 1945, the XXI Bomber Command changed tactics and started carrying out low-level night incendiary raids on area targets.  During the Allied assault on [[Okinawa]], groups of the 314th Bomb Wing attacked airfields from which the Japanese were sending out [[kamikaze|suicide planes]] against the invasion force.\n\nFlying out of Guam, [[Henry E. Erwin|S/Sgt Henry E Erwin]] of the 29th Bombardment Group was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for action that saved his B-29 during a mission over [[Koriyama]], Japan, on 12 April 1945. When a phosphorus smoke bomb exploded in the launching chute and shot back into the plane, Sgt Erwin picked up the burning bomb, carried it to a window, and threw it out.\n\nAfter the war, B-29s from North Field dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners and participated in several show-of-force missions over Japan.  The 29th, 39th and 330th Bomb Groups returned to the United States and deactivated in December 1945. The 19th remained in Guam to become the station's host unit after the 314th Bomb Wing was reassigned to [[Johnson AB]], Japan for occupation duty.\n\n===Postwar years===\n[[File:Aerial view of Andersen AFB.jpg|thumb|alt=Aerial view|Northwest Field at Andersen Air Force Base]]\nAfter the end of [[World War II]], [[Guam]] served as a collection point for surplus war goods that had accumulated in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]].\n\nThe [[19th Bombardment Wing]] (BW) was formed at North AFB in 1948 from the resources of the former North Guam Air Force Base Command (Provisional). The 19th BW operated [[Andersen AFB]] and continued utilizing B-29s. In May 1949, the headquarters of the [[Twentieth Air Force]] moved from Guam to [[Kadena AB]], [[Okinawa]]. Its former staff was assigned to the 19th BW.\n\nAt Andersen, the wing assumed responsibility for supervising two active bases and one semi-active base, an assortment of communication, weather, radar, rescue and other facilities and units, including the [[Marianas Air Material Area]], a wing size unit.<ref>Ravenstein, Charles A.

[[Maxwell Air Force Base]], [[Alabama]]: Office of Air Force History 1984. {{ISBN|0-912799-12-9}}.</ref> Many of the units and facilities were deactivated within a few months.\n\nIn October 1949, the 19th Wing was transferred to the 20th Air Force's command. The remaining units in the Marianas and Bonin Islands were shifted to other organizations.  From 17 October 1949 until 28 June 1950, the wing continued B-29 training, operation of Andersen Air Force Base, and rescue and reconnaissance missions.\n\n===1950s===\nThree days after [[North Korea]] invaded [[South Korea]] in 1950, the 19th Bomb Group deployed [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]] to Andersen to begin bombing targets throughout [[South Korea]]. A few days later, the group was detached from the 19th BW and deployed to [[Kadena Air Base]] on [[Okinawa Island]], Japan. The rest of the wing remained at Andersen, provided maintenance for transient aircraft, and operated ammunition dumps until 1953.\n\nIn 1951, the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) selected several overseas bases to support rotational unit deployments of its bombers from stateside bases, starting with [[B-29 Superfortress]] units and later including [[Convair B-36]], [[B-47 Stratojet]], [[B-50 Superfortress]] bombers, and [[Boeing KB-29|KB-29]] refueling tankers.\n\nWith decreased hostility in [[Korea]], the 19th BW headquarters was relocated to [[Kadena Air Base]], Japan in 1953 and was replaced by the 6319th Air Base Wing of the [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Forces (FEAF)]].\n\nHowever, the [[United States Far East Air Force|FEAF Bomber Command]] ([[United States Far East Air Force|FEAF's]] 19th Bomb Wing and [[Strategic Air Command|SAC's]] 98th and 307th Bomb Wings) was deactivated in 1954. Its three B-29 wings returned to the contiguous United States and were replaced with [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47s]].\n\nThe 3rd Air Division was activated on 18 June in its place. Its objective was to control all SAC units in the Far East. The division operated as a tenant unit from June 1954 until April 1955 and received host-base support services from the 6319th until that unit was inactivated on 1 April 1955. The 6319th was replaced with the SAC-aligned 3960th Air Base Wing.\n\nThe [[Strategic Air Command]] continued its 90-day unit rotational training program and began to take control of the base from the [[United States Far East Air Force|FEAF]]. After the 1 April 1955 base transfer and activation of the 3960th Air Base Wing, [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47s]] replaced the [[Convair B-36|B-36s]] in the rotations. The 43rd Bomb Wing from [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]], operated from July to October 1957, which eventually became Andersen's host unit. The 3960th Air Base Wing was redesignated on 1 July 1956 as the 3960th Air Base Group.\n\nThe [[41st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] of the [[United States Pacific Air Forces|Pacific Air Forces]], along with its [[F-86 Sabre|F-86s]], was stationed at Andersen from August 1956 until it was deactivated in March 1960. After that, the air defense mission was provided by deployments of [[Fifth Air Force|Fifth]] and [[Thirteenth Air Force]] units flying the [[F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102]] aircraft.<ref name=\"global\">{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/andersen.htm |title=Andersen AFB |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=25 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708195013/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/andersen.htm |archivedate=8 July 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\nAndersen's rotational duties concluded when the [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47]] was phased out and replaced by the [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. The first [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]], the \"City of El Paso,\" arrived from the 95th Bomb Wing at [[Biggs Army Airfield|Biggs Air Force Base]], Texas in March 1964. It was followed by [[KC-135 Stratotanker]]s.\n\nWith the start of [[Operation Arc Light]] in June 1965, [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52Fs]] and [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135As]] began regular bombing missions over [[Vietnam]] and continued until 1973, with a break between August 1970 and early 1972.\n\nIn support of [[Operation Arc Light]], [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] activated the [[List of USAF Strategic Wings assigned to the Strategic Air Command|4133rd Bombardment Wing (Provisional)]] on 1 February 1966. The [[List of USAF Strategic Wings assigned to the Strategic Air Command|3960th Strategic Wing]], which was originally activated in 1955 as the 3960th Air Base Wing, continued as the base's host wing until it was deactivated and replaced by the [[List of USAF Strategic Wings assigned to the Strategic Air Command|43rd Strategic Wing]] on 1 April 1970. The 43rd assumed the mission of the 4133rd on 1 July 1970 and continued in this capacity until the 57th Air Division (Provisional) and [[List of USAF Strategic Wings assigned to the Strategic Air Command|72nd Strategic Wing (Provisional)]] were activated in June 1972 in support of '''Operation Bullet Shot'''<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/bullet_shot.htm\n |title       = Operation Bullet Shot\n |publisher   = GlobalSecurity.org\n |accessdate  = 23 July 2011\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20111204002534/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/bullet_shot.htm\n |archivedate = 4 December 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> ([[military operation]] name for [[temporary duty assignment]] of US-based [[technician]]s \u2014 \"the herd shot 'round the world.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://hvac-talk.com/vbb/archive/index.php/t-126172.html\n |title       = USAF has hit Al Queda in Africa\n |author      = bootlen\n |date        = 1 September 2007\n |format      = forum\n |work        = ARP For non HVAC topics\n |publisher   = HVAC-Talk\n |accessdate  = 15 July 2011\n |quote       = ....

The 303rd Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Wing (Provisional) was activated in July of the same year. All of the provisional units remained at Andersen until bombing missions ceased on 15 November 1973.\n\n[[File:Andersen AFB with 150 B-52s 1972.jpg|thumb|About 150 B-52s at Andersen AFB, fall 1972]]\n[[Operation Linebacker II]] continued the mission of [[Operation Arc Light]], and was most notable for its 11-day bombing campaign between 18 and 29 December 1972, in which more than 150 [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers flew 729 [[sortie]]s in 11 days. The [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] at Andersen, combined with other bombers stationed at [[U-Tapao International Airport|U-Tapao Field]] in Thailand, constituted about 50 percent of [[Strategic Air Command|SAC's]] total bomber force and 75 percent of all combat crews. Two bases contained the equivalent of 13 stateside bomber wings.\n\nThe frequent bombings resulted in a cease-fire in [[Vietnam]]. However, the [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] continued to fly missions over [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]] until those were halted on 15 August 1973. With the end of these runs, more than 100 [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]], both D and G Models, were deployed elsewhere in the world by October 1973. The [[Eighth Air Force]] moved to [[Barksdale Air Force Base]], [[Louisiana]], and the 3rd Air Division was reactivated on 1 January 1975.\n\nWhen the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]] forces overran [[South Vietnam]] later in 1975, the base provided emergency relief and shelter for thousands of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] evacuees as a part of ''[[Operation New Life]]''. After the fall of [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], Andersen received almost 40,000 refugees and processed another 109,000 for transportation to the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacaf.af.mil/Info/FactSheets/Display/tabid/420/Article/909895/andersen-air-force-base.aspx|title=Andersen Air Force Base|website=Pacific Air Forces|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\nThe base returned to routine operations by the late 1970s, but continued to serve as one of [[Strategic Air Command|SAC's]] strategic locations. Crews and aircraft were regularly sent to sites between Australia, [[Alaska]], and [[Korea]] and supported sea surveillance operations support for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].\n\nAndersen was also home to the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron \"Typhoon Chasers\" during the 1960s through the 1980s. Air crews flying [[WC-130]]s tracked and penetrated typhoons, providing advanced warnings to military and civilian populations throughout the western Pacific. During the Vietnam War, the 54th also provided cloud-seeding capability along the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and synoptic reconnaissance, deploying from [[Udorn RTAFB]] when not in Guam. The 54th WRS was inactivated in September 1987.\n\n===Post-Vietnam===\nIn 1983, the 43rd completed its transition from the [[B-52 Stratofortress#B-52D|B-52D]] to the [[B-52 Stratofortress#B-52G|B-52G]] and became one of only two [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] bomber wings equipped with the [[Boeing Harpoon|Harpoon anti-ship missile]].\n\nThe base saw a major change in 1989, when control transferred from the [[Strategic Air Command]] to [[Pacific Air Forces]]. The 633rd Air Base Wing activated on 1 October 1989, which led to the deactivations of the 43rd Bomb Wing on 26 March 1990 and the 60th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 30 April 1990.\n\nIn August 1990, Andersen personnel began shipping over 37,000 tons of munitions to forces in the [[Persian Gulf]] in support of [[Gulf War|Operations Desert Shield]] and [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/trump-s-plan-pay-border-wall-air-force-funds-risks-n1054091|title=Trump's plan to pay for border wall with Air Force funds risks national security, report says|last=Kube|first=Courtney|work=NBC News|language=en|url-status=live|date=13 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in June 1991, Andersen was instrumental in caring for American evacuees and their pets as a part of [[Operation Fiery Vigil]].

The 36th Air Base Wing took over host operations and was redesignated as the [[36th Wing]] on 12 April 2006. In October 1994, the U.S. Navy's Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Five (HC-5) relocated to Andersen from the now-closed [[Naval Air Station Agana]], Guam.  HC-5 was later redesignated as Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Twenty-Five ([[HSC-25]]) following its transition from the [[CH-46]] to the [[MH-60S]].\n\nThe base was one of the [[Space Shuttle#Landing sites|few places in the world]] where the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]] was permitted to land, serving as an Augmented Emergency Landing Site for the Shuttle orbiter.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |title=Space Shuttle Emergency Landing Sites |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=20 July 2011|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331115426/http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |archivedate=31 March 2016  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the 50-year-old South Runway's condition had deteriorated to a point at which complete removal and replacement of the runway was necessary to maintain safety.

The allegations included poaching, illegal trapping of coconut crabs and resale of trophy deer, paving beaches, and stripping vegetation used for nesting by endangered hawksbill turtles and green sea turtles.

Due to Guam's almost unrestricted airspace and the close proximity of the [[Farallon de Medinilla|Farallon de Medinilla Island]], a naval bombing range {{convert|184|mi|km}} north, the base is in an ideal training location.\n\n==History==\nAndersen Air Force Base was established on 3 December 1944 and is named for Brigadier General James Roy Andersen (1904\u20131945).  General Andersen graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1926, served at various army installations, and obtained his wings at [[Kelly AFB|Kelly Field]], Texas, in 1936. During 1943\u20131944 he served on the War Department General Staff. In January 1945, General Andersen was assigned to HQ AAF, Pacific Ocean Area. He died on 26 February 1945 in the crash of a [[B-24 Liberator]] aircraft between [[Kwajalein]] and [[Johnston Island]] while en route to [[Hawaii]].\n\n===World War II===\nAndersen Air Force Base's origins begin on 7 December 1941 when Guam was attacked by the armed forces of [[Imperial Japan]] in the [[Battle of Guam (1941)]] three hours after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The United States Navy surrendered Guam to the Japanese on 10 December. At the height of the war, approximately 19,000 Japanese soldiers and sailors were deployed to the island. Guam was liberated by the [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine Corps']] 3rd Amphibious Corps on 21 July 1944, in the [[Battle of Guam (1944)]], after a 13-day pre-invasion bombardment.\n\nThe Japanese managed to contain the Marines on two beachheads, but their counter-attack failed. The Marines renewed their assault, and reached the northern tip of the island on 10 August 1944.  Japanese guerrilla activities continued until the end of the war, and some were [[Japanese holdout|holdouts]] for many years afterwards.\n\nGuam was considered ideal to establish air bases to launch [[B-29 Superfortress]] operations against the [[Japanese Archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]]. The [[Marianas Islands]] are about {{convert|1500|mi|km}} from Tokyo, a range which the B-29s could just about manage. Most important of all, it could be put on a direct supply line from the United States by ship.  \"North Field,\" as Andersen AFB was first named, was the first air base built in Guam after its liberation. Its construction began in November 1944 and was supported by the [[United States Navy]] [[Seabee]]s.  North Field and its co-located [[Northwest Field (Guam)|Northwest Field]] was a massive installation, with four main runways, taxiways, revetments for over 200 B-29s, and a large containment area for base operations and personnel.\n\nThe first host unit at North Field was the [[314th Air Division|314th Bombardment Wing]], [[XXI Bomber Command]], [[Twentieth Air Force]].  The 314th arrived in Guam on 16 January 1945 from Peterson Field, Colorado.  The 314th controlled four operational B-29 bomb groups, the [[19th Air Refueling Wing|19th]], (Square M), [[29th Bombardment Group|29th]] (Square O), [[39th Air Expeditionary Wing|39th]] (Square P), and [[330th Bombardment Group (VH)|330th]] (Square K).\n\nB-29 Superfortress missions from North Field were attacks against strategic targets in Japan, operating in daylight and at a high altitude to bomb factories, refineries, and other objectives. In March 1945, the XXI Bomber Command changed tactics and started carrying out low-level night incendiary raids on area targets.  During the Allied assault on [[Okinawa]], groups of the 314th Bomb Wing attacked airfields from which the Japanese were sending out [[kamikaze|suicide planes]] against the invasion force.\n\nFlying out of Guam, [[Henry E. Erwin|S/Sgt Henry E Erwin]] of the 29th Bombardment Group was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for action that saved his B-29 during a mission over [[Koriyama]], Japan, on 12 April 1945. When a phosphorus smoke bomb exploded in the launching chute and shot back into the plane, Sgt Erwin picked up the burning bomb, carried it to a window, and threw it out.\n\nAfter the war, B-29s from North Field dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners and participated in several show-of-force missions over Japan.  The 29th, 39th and 330th Bomb Groups returned to the United States and deactivated in December 1945. The 19th remained in Guam to become the station's host unit after the 314th Bomb Wing was reassigned to [[Johnson AB]], Japan for occupation duty.\n\n===Postwar years===\n[[File:Aerial view of Andersen AFB.jpg|thumb|alt=Aerial view|Northwest Field at Andersen Air Force Base]]\nAfter the end of [[World War II]], [[Guam]] served as a collection point for surplus war goods that had accumulated in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]].\n\nThe [[19th Bombardment Wing]] (BW) was formed at North AFB in 1948 from the resources of the former North Guam Air Force Base Command (Provisional). The 19th BW operated [[Andersen AFB]] and continued utilizing B-29s. In May 1949, the headquarters of the [[Twentieth Air Force]] moved from Guam to [[Kadena AB]], [[Okinawa]]. Its former staff was assigned to the 19th BW.\n\nAt Andersen, the wing assumed responsibility for supervising two active bases and one semi-active base, an assortment of communication, weather, radar, rescue and other facilities and units, including the [[Marianas Air Material Area]], a wing size unit.<ref>Ravenstein, Charles A. ''Air Force Combat Wings Lineage and Honors Histories 1947\u20131977''. [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], [[Alabama]]: Office of Air Force History 1984. {{ISBN|0-912799-12-9}}.</ref> Many of the units and facilities were deactivated within a few months.\n\nIn October 1949, the 19th Wing was transferred to the 20th Air Force's command. The remaining units in the Marianas and Bonin Islands were shifted to other organizations.  From 17 October 1949 until 28 June 1950, the wing continued B-29 training, operation of Andersen Air Force Base, and rescue and reconnaissance missions.\n\n===1950s===\nThree days after [[North Korea]] invaded [[South Korea]] in 1950, the 19th Bomb Group deployed [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]] to Andersen to begin bombing targets throughout [[South Korea]]. A few days later, the group was detached from the 19th BW and deployed to [[Kadena Air Base]] on [[Okinawa Island]], Japan. The rest of the wing remained at Andersen, provided maintenance for transient aircraft, and operated ammunition dumps until 1953.\n\nIn 1951, the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) selected several overseas bases to support rotational unit deployments of its bombers from stateside bases, starting with [[B-29 Superfortress]] units and later including [[Convair B-36]], [[B-47 Stratojet]], [[B-50 Superfortress]] bombers, and [[Boeing KB-29|KB-29]] refueling tankers.\n\nWith decreased hostility in [[Korea]], the 19th BW headquarters was relocated to [[Kadena Air Base]], Japan in 1953 and was replaced by the 6319th Air Base Wing of the [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Forces (FEAF)]].\n\nHowever, the [[United States Far East Air Force|FEAF Bomber Command]] ([[United States Far East Air Force|FEAF's]] 19th Bomb Wing and [[Strategic Air Command|SAC's]] 98th and 307th Bomb Wings) was deactivated in 1954. Its three B-29 wings returned to the contiguous United States and were replaced with [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47s]].\n\nThe 3rd Air Division was activated on 18 June in its place. Its objective was to control all SAC units in the Far East. The division operated as a tenant unit from June 1954 until April 1955 and received host-base support services from the 6319th until that unit was inactivated on 1 April 1955. The 6319th was replaced with the SAC-aligned 3960th Air Base Wing.\n\nThe [[Strategic Air Command]] continued its 90-day unit rotational training program and began to take control of the base from the [[United States Far East Air Force|FEAF]]. After the 1 April 1955 base transfer and activation of the 3960th Air Base Wing, [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47s]] replaced the [[Convair B-36|B-36s]] in the rotations. The 43rd Bomb Wing from [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]], operated from July to October 1957, which eventually became Andersen's host unit. The 3960th Air Base Wing was redesignated on 1 July 1956 as the 3960th Air Base Group.\n\nThe [[41st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] of the [[United States Pacific Air Forces|Pacific Air Forces]], along with its [[F-86 Sabre|F-86s]], was stationed at Andersen from August 1956 until it was deactivated in March 1960. After that, the air defense mission was provided by deployments of [[Fifth Air Force|Fifth]] and [[Thirteenth Air Force]] units flying the [[F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102]] aircraft.<ref name=\"global\">{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/andersen.htm |title=Andersen AFB |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=25 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708195013/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/andersen.htm |archivedate=8 July 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\nAndersen's rotational duties concluded when the [[B-47 Stratojet|B-47]] was phased out and replaced by the [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. The first [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]], the \"City of El Paso,\" arrived from the 95th Bomb Wing at [[Biggs Army Airfield|Biggs Air Force Base]], Texas in March 1964. It was followed by [[KC-135 Stratotanker]]s.\n\nWith the start of [[Operation Arc Light]] in June 1965, [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52Fs]] and [[KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135As]] began regular bombing missions over [[Vietnam]] and continued until 1973, with a break between August 1970 and early 1972.\n\nIn support of [[Operation Arc Light]], [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] activated the [[List of USAF Strategic Wings assigned to the Strategic Air Command|4133rd Bombardment Wing (Provisional)]] on 1 February 1966.

All of the provisional units remained at Andersen until bombing missions ceased on 15 November 1973.\n\n[[File:Andersen AFB with 150 B-52s 1972.jpg|thumb|About 150 B-52s at Andersen AFB, fall 1972]]\n[[Operation Linebacker II]] continued the mission of [[Operation Arc Light]], and was most notable for its 11-day bombing campaign between 18 and 29 December 1972, in which more than 150 [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers flew 729 [[sortie]]s in 11 days. The [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] at Andersen, combined with other bombers stationed at [[U-Tapao International Airport|U-Tapao Field]] in Thailand, constituted about 50 percent of [[Strategic Air Command|SAC's]] total bomber force and 75 percent of all combat crews. Two bases contained the equivalent of 13 stateside bomber wings.\n\nThe frequent bombings resulted in a cease-fire in [[Vietnam]]. However, the [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] continued to fly missions over [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]] until those were halted on 15 August 1973. With the end of these runs, more than 100 [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]], both D and G Models, were deployed elsewhere in the world by October 1973. The [[Eighth Air Force]] moved to [[Barksdale Air Force Base]], [[Louisiana]], and the 3rd Air Division was reactivated on 1 January 1975.\n\nWhen the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]] forces overran [[South Vietnam]] later in 1975, the base provided emergency relief and shelter for thousands of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] evacuees as a part of ''[[Operation New Life]]''. After the fall of [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], Andersen received almost 40,000 refugees and processed another 109,000 for transportation to the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacaf.af.mil/Info/FactSheets/Display/tabid/420/Article/909895/andersen-air-force-base.aspx|title=Andersen Air Force Base|website=Pacific Air Forces|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>\n\nThe base returned to routine operations by the late 1970s, but continued to serve as one of [[Strategic Air Command|SAC's]] strategic locations. Crews and aircraft were regularly sent to sites between Australia, [[Alaska]], and [[Korea]] and supported sea surveillance operations support for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].\n\nAndersen was also home to the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron \"Typhoon Chasers\" during the 1960s through the 1980s. Air crews flying [[WC-130]]s tracked and penetrated typhoons, providing advanced warnings to military and civilian populations throughout the western Pacific. During the Vietnam War, the 54th also provided cloud-seeding capability along the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and synoptic reconnaissance, deploying from [[Udorn RTAFB]] when not in Guam. The 54th WRS was inactivated in September 1987.\n\n===Post-Vietnam===\nIn 1983, the 43rd completed its transition from the [[B-52 Stratofortress#B-52D|B-52D]] to the [[B-52 Stratofortress#B-52G|B-52G]] and became one of only two [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] bomber wings equipped with the [[Boeing Harpoon|Harpoon anti-ship missile]].\n\nThe base saw a major change in 1989, when control transferred from the [[Strategic Air Command]] to [[Pacific Air Forces]]. The 633rd Air Base Wing activated on 1 October 1989, which led to the deactivations of the 43rd Bomb Wing on 26 March 1990 and the 60th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 30 April 1990.\n\nIn August 1990, Andersen personnel began shipping over 37,000 tons of munitions to forces in the [[Persian Gulf]] in support of [[Gulf War|Operations Desert Shield]] and [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/trump-s-plan-pay-border-wall-air-force-funds-risks-n1054091|title=Trump's plan to pay for border wall with Air Force funds risks national security, report says|last=Kube|first=Courtney|work=NBC News|language=en|url-status=live|date=13 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in June 1991, Andersen was instrumental in caring for American evacuees and their pets as a part of [[Operation Fiery Vigil]]. In December, Andersen became home to the [[Thirteenth Air Force]], which had evacuated from [[Clark Air Base]] in the [[Philippines]] after the eruption.\n\n=== Post Cold War ===\n[[File:B-1B at ground.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A [[B-1B bomber]] at Andersen]]\n[[File:B-2 and F-15 over Andersen Air Force Base.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[B-2 Spirit]] and [[F-15]]s over Andersen AFB, 2005]]\nThe host unit was changed on 1 October 1994, when the 633rd Air Base Wing was deactivated. The 36th Air Base Wing took over host operations and was redesignated as the [[36th Wing]] on 12 April 2006. In October 1994, the U.S. Navy's Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Five (HC-5) relocated to Andersen from the now-closed [[Naval Air Station Agana]], Guam.  HC-5 was later redesignated as Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Twenty-Five ([[HSC-25]]) following its transition from the [[CH-46]] to the [[MH-60S]].\n\nThe base was one of the [[Space Shuttle#Landing sites|few places in the world]] where the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]] was permitted to land, serving as an Augmented Emergency Landing Site for the Shuttle orbiter.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |title=Space Shuttle Emergency Landing Sites |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=20 July 2011|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331115426/http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |archivedate=31 March 2016  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the 50-year-old South Runway's condition had deteriorated to a point at which complete removal and replacement of the runway was necessary to maintain safety.

The allegations included poaching, illegal trapping of coconut crabs and resale of trophy deer, paving beaches, and stripping vegetation used for nesting by endangered hawksbill turtles and green sea turtles. [[Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility|Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER)]] said, \"The Air Force program for protecting Guam's natural resources has utterly broken down.\"<ref>''[[Pacific Daily News]]'', \"Andersen To Review Alleged Environmental Violations\", 7 March 2009.</ref> The Department of Defense Inspector General (DOD IG) determined that the Air Force responses to the PEER allegations adequately addressed the issues raised.

He was one of three brothers called Bektash, Hajredin and Sulo Bey. They formed The Cakrani Foundation which was active in Albania from 1920.\nInitially, The Cakrani Foundation provided humanitarian aid for refugees affected by the Spanish Flu, the Balkan Wars and World War One. Later, it supported poor children through offering scholarships during King Zog\u2019s reign, and saved all Jewish refugees who lived in Berat after the German occupation of Albania in September 1943.\nThe family helped refugees from Kosovo between the year 1932-1935 after King Zog had sent most of them to settle in Fier, around the Seman river. All Albanian-Kosovars who now live in that part of Albania are the descendants of the Kosovar refugees of the year 1932-1935.\nThe Cakrani Foundation tried to aid The Perugia Division, which numbered 8000 in total after the Italian capitulation in September 1943. They rescued 500 of them and hid them in Mallakaster, where with the family\u2019s help they built a camp, which also functioned as a hospital.\nKujtim Cakrani a leading officer of Balli Kombetar, managed to hide all the Jewish families in Lushnja and Mallakaster. To stop people denouncing the Jews, Kadri Cakrani gave a roof to all of the families who they found in Berat.\nThe level of humanitarian aid offered by this one family to people who needed it in Albania from 1914-1944 is extraordinary. All the help offered and given came from their own pockets. This family had to stop their help to the ones who were most in need in early 1945, following the persecution of the family by the communists.\nToday, The Cakrani Foundation has been renewed since 2000. It offers similar help to the original foundation to the ones that need it most. This foundation is run by the lawyer Kujtim Cakrani, who is a descendant of the original Cakrani family.\n\n'''Spanish flu aid relief'''\nHere is a quote taken from the Hajredin Bej\u2019s diary, a book published in Albanian by the historian Kastriot Bimo, stating:\n\u201cWe returned back home and saw refugees on the way which possibly are as a result of the flu and the victims of the Greeks, who have burnt down their villages, and 50-100 souls are dying every day, which is not a inconsiderable loss of life. We have been told that this flu is spread across Europe, and it\u2019s killing people en masse. Refugees, we have been told, have come via Vlora and from both sides of Vjosa river. This is the last we needed at this time for our nation. I can easily call this a tragedy. We didn\u2019t wait for the summer, but got together with all the local notables and appealed to everyone to collect things for the refugees, like clothes, food and money, and we as brothers to get this done, decided to give this responsibility to our ladies. Also, we have instructed our servants to help with this\u201d.\nAccording to Marigo Posio\u2019s chronicle of the times, the contribution of the Cakrani brothers, Hajredin, Sule and Bektash Bey, and their family to the refugees they were able to help was fourteen cows, 120 sheep, 200 Francs in money and clothes.\n\n\n\n\n==References==\nWWI and Spanish flu victims Albania 1918\nAlbanian Jewish refugees\nKosovan refugees in Albania 1932-1935\nKing Zog of Albania\nWWII Jewish Refugee Albania and Perugia Division\n\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Independent Albania |state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cakrani, Hajredin}}\n[[Category:19th-century Albanian people]]\n[[Category:Signatories of the Albanian Declaration of Independence]]\n[[Category:Party of Labour of Albania politicians]]\n[[Category:Year of death missing]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing]]\n[[Category:All-Albanian Congress delegates]]\n[[Category:Congress of Durr\u00ebs delegates]]\n\n{{Albania-bio-stub}}\n", "text_old": "'''Hajredin Cakrani''' was a 19th-century [[Albania]]n politician.
