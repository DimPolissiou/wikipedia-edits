These are similar to Swinburne's argument but take a deductive form rather than an inductive one.\n\n[[William Lane Craig]] put the argument from consciousness as follows<ref>https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/does-god-exist1/</ref>:\n#If God did not exist, intentional states of consciousness would not exist.\n#But intentional states of consciousness do exist.\n#Therefore, God exists.\n\n[[Peter Kreeft]] has put forward a deductive form of the argument from consciousness<ref>http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics-more/20_arguments-gods-existence.htm#10</ref> based upon the intelligibility of the universe despite the limitations of our minds. He phrases it deductively as follows:\n#\"We experience the universe as intelligible. This intelligibility means that the universe is graspable by intelligence.\"\n#\"Either this intelligible universe and the finite minds so well suited to grasp it are the products of intelligence, or both intelligibility and intelligence are the products of blind chance.\"\n#\"Not blind chance.\"\n#\"Therefore this intelligible universe and the finite minds so well suited to grasp it are the products of intelligence.\"\nHe compares his argument to [[C. S. Lewis]]' [[argument from reason]].\n\n===Platonic form===\n\nThe Christian philosopher [[Augustine of Hippo]] formed a formulation of the argument from consciousness, sometimes termed the '''Argument from truth''' which is closely aligned to consciousness, whilst using neither inductive nor deductive methodology. The argument was influenced by [[Platonism]].\n#Our limited minds can discover eternal truths about being.\n#Truth properly resides in a mind.\n#But the human mind is not eternal.\n#Therefore there must exist an eternal mind in which these truths reside.\n\nThe Catholic philosopher [[Peter Kreeft]], whilst he feels that it could be an effective argument, feels that we have too little knowledge of the workings of consciousness for this to be truly convincing as of yet. <ref>http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics-more/20_arguments-gods-existence.htm#11</ref>\n\nAnother Catholic philosopher, [[Edward Feser]] has promoted the Augustinian argument, including it in his book ''Five Proofs of the Existence of God''. <ref>http://www.religioustolerance.org/case-for-god33.htm</ref> He concludes that Augustine's argument is valid, having given many different reasons why Platonism, its primary premise, is true. \n\nHis inclusion of the argument led to an extremely critical review of his book on the existence of God to be published <ref>https://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/13752</ref> by [[Richard Carrier]]. His criticism is that Feser misunderstands the argument and confuses potentiality and actuality. Feser responded to Carrier's criticisms <ref>http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2018/02/carrier-on-five-proofs.html</ref>, saying, \"Pop atheist writer Richard Carrier grandly claims to have \u201cdebunked!\u201d (exclamation point in the original) ''Five Proofs of the Existence of God''.  It\u2019s a bizarrely incompetent performance.  To say that Carrier attacks [[straw men]] would be an insult to [[straw men]], which usually bear at least a crude resemblance to the argument under consideration.\" He deals with Carrier's objections, concluding the article by writing \"It is hard to believe that Carrier actually read Five Proofs through, but I certainly did not bother to read the rest of his critique, judging that if what he has to say about the Aristotelian proof is this awful, it would be a waste of time and energy to proceed any further.  If any reader has bothered to read it and found some gold among the dross, feel free to call our attention to it in the combox below.\" \n\nCarrier himself responded <ref>https://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/13830</ref> to Feser's critique of his critique, by writing, \"I had a good laugh when Feser fans claimed he \u201cdestroyed\u201d my critique this week, and at first thought, \u201cOh gosh, did I get something wrong I need to correct?\u201d And then I read his reply. Face, meet palm. Holy cow. His response is wildly inept. I\u2019ll lay it out for you here.\"  Feser replied by writing, \"Carrier\u2019s self-confidence is so absurdly out of proportion to his actual competence that he does not realize that the only deathblows he delivers are of the self-inflicted kind.  In particular, in no fewer than three places in his response, Carrier has inadvertently revealed himself to be either an extremely reckless liar or guilty of malpractice that would make any actual scholar (as opposed to the online hobbyist Carrier is) a professional laughingstock.\" He pointed out in his article three places in which Carrier contradicts himself, and states that to reply any further to Carrier would be to give him more credit than he deserves. <ref>http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2018/03/carrier-carries-on.html#more</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThe first premise,  assertion that non-physical mental states exist, implies a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist view of mind]]. Therefore, one line of attack is to argue the case for [[physicalism]] about the human mind.<ref>Melnyk, Andrew (2007). [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/andrew_melnyk/physicalism.html \"A Case for Physicalism about the Human Mind\"]</ref> Moreland takes the arguments for the first premise and refers to classic defenses of dualism. However, the first premise is rejected by many philosophers of mind. [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]], known for the [[knowledge argument]] in support of dualism about the mind, comments on the debate between physicalist and dualist conceptions of mind:\n{{quote|\nMuch of the contemporary debate in the philosophy of mind is concerned with the clash between certain strongly held intuitions and what science tells us about the mind and its relation to the world. What science tells us about the mind points strongly towards some version or other of physicalism. The intuitions, in one way or another, suggest that there is something seriously incomplete about any purely physical story about the mind ... Most contemporary philosophers given a choice between going with science and going with intuitions, go with science. Although I once dissented from the majority, I have capitulated and now see the interesting issue as being where the arguments from the intuitions against physicalism\u2014the arguments that seem so compelling\u2014go wrong.<ref>Jackson, Frank Cameron (2003) [http://consciousness.anu.edu.au/jackson/mindillusion.pdf \"Mind and Illusion\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706124725/http://consciousness.anu.edu.au/jackson/mindillusion.pdf |date=July 6, 2008 }}, in ''Minds and Persons'', Cambridge University Press</ref>}}\n\nIf one is willing to accept the first premise that reductive forms of physicalism are false, then the argument takes off. Thus, one could think of Moreland as making an argument that tries to move a person from \"rejecting physicalism\" to \"accepting theism\". The crucial step in this move is the fifth premise, which asserts that naturalism can not account for non-physical mental states. A critique of this premise is offered by Andrew Melnyk:\n{{quote|\nNaturalism can easily explain how the universe came to contain physically irreducible conscious occurrences. It can do so by supposing that, among the fundamental laws governing the universe, there are some according to which, whenever such-and-such complex nonconscious occurrences occur, so-and-so conscious occurrences occur; perhaps such a law says that, whenever a human brain attains a certain kind and degree of complexity, a pain is experienced. Given such laws, the capacity for consciousness that some creatures enjoy, like the capacity for breathing, can be explained as having arisen through natural selection. Through mutation, some creature was born with a brain of the requisite kind and degree of complexity to generate conscious experiences; and then, because these experiences increased the creature's fitness, such creatures were selected for.<ref>Melnyk, Andrew (2007). [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/andrew_melnyk/against-dualism.html#conscious \"Naturalism, Free Choices, and Conscious Experiences\"]</ref>}}\n\nHowever Moreland charges that such attempts to accommodate consciousness within an atheistic worldview are ''ad hoc'' and contrived and fail to take into account many features of conscious experience.<ref>Moreland,J.P. (2007). [http://afterall.net/papers/490852 \"Argument from consciousness\"]</ref>\nMoreland spends much of the book defending this premise against philosophers, such as [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], who accept pluralist naturalism. He also critiques contemporary philosophers of mind such as [[John Searle]], [[Timothy O' Connor]], [[Colin McGinn]], [[David Skriba]], [[Philip Clayton (philosopher)|Philip Clayton]] and [[Jaegwon Kim]], who attempt to account for consciousness.\n\nFinally, one can also question premise seven: why does a personal explanation have to lead to [[monotheistic]] (as opposed to [[deist]]ic or [[polytheist]]ic) accounts of intention?<ref>Steven J. Conifer (2001). [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/steven_conifer/ac.html \"The Argument from Consciousness Refuted\"].</ref> However, Moreland maintains that questioning these minor premises is of little consolation to the naturalist as they essentially constitute intramural theist debates, and that for most westerners theism is the only viable candidate to accommodate personal explanations.

Prologue. \"It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement, hobbits are relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves. [...] But what exactly our relationship is can no longer be discovered.\"</ref> of the [[race (fantasy)|race]] of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]. Elsewhere, Tolkien describes hobbits as a \"variety\"<ref name=\"variety\" group=T>Tolkien, J. R. R. ''Guide to the Names of the Lord of the Rings'', \"The Firstborn\"</ref> or separate \"branch\"<ref name=\"branch\" group=T>Carpenter: ''The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien'', #131</ref> of humans. Hobbits and other races seem aware of the similarities (hence the colloquial terms \"Big People\" and \"Little People\" used in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]). However, hobbits considered themselves a separate people.<ref group=T>Tolkien: ''The Fellowship of the Ring''. Many Meetings. \u201cIf you can\u2019t distinguish between a Man and a Hobbit, your judgement is poorer than I imagined. They\u2019re as different as peas and apples.\u201d</ref> At the time of the events in ''The Lord of the Rings'', hobbits lived in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] and in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]] in the north west of Middle-earth, though by the end, some had moved out to the [[Tower Hills]] and to [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]].\n\n==Origins==\n{{further|Hobbit (word)}}\n \nTolkien claimed that he started ''The Hobbit'' suddenly, without premeditation, in the midst of grading a set of student essay exams, writing on a blank piece of paper: \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit\".<ref>Carpenter: ''J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography'', p. 172</ref> \n\n===Fictional etymology===\n\nTolkien set out a fictional [[etymology]] for the [[Hobbit (word)|word \"hobbit\"]] in an appendix to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', to the effect that it was ultimately derived from ''holbytla'' (plural ''holbytlan''), meaning \"hole-builder\".<ref name=annot group=T>{{cite book |title=The Annotated Hobbit: The Hobbit, or, There and Back Again |url=https://archive.org/details/annotatedhobbith0000tolk |url-access=registration |first=John Ronald Reuel |last=Tolkien |editor=Douglas Anderson |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1988 |isbn=0-395-47690-9}}</ref><ref name=\"EncycArda\"/> This was Tolkien's own new construction from [[Old English]] ''hol'', \"a hole or hollow\", and ''bytlan'', \"to build\".<ref name=\"Clark Hall 2002\">{{cite book |last1=Clark Hall |first1=J.

One is a fact that Tolkien admitted:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Letter_to_Harry_C._Bauer|title=Letter to Harry C. Bauer - Tolkien Gateway |website=tolkiengateway.net |access-date=1 January 2020}}</ref> the title of [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s 1922 novel ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'', about a \"complacent American businessman\" who goes through a journey of some kind of self-discovery, facing \"near-disgrace; the critic [[Tom Shippey]] observes that there are some parallels here with Bilbo's own journey.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}}\n\nAccording to a letter from Tolkien to [[W. H. Auden]], one \"probably .. unconscious\" inspiration was [[Edward Wyke Smith]]'s 1927 children's book ''[[The Marvellous Land of Snergs]]''.<ref name=annot group=T/> Tolkien described the Snergs as \"a race of people only slightly taller than the average table but broad in the shoulders and [who] have the strength of ten men.\"{{sfn|Carpenter|1977|p=165}}\n\n===Earlier uses===\n\nAnother possible origin emerged in 1977 when the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' announced that it had found the source that it supposed Tolkien to have used: J. Hardy wrote in his 1895 ''The Denham Tracts, Volume 2'': \"The whole earth was overrun with ghosts, boggles ... hobbits, hobgoblins.\" The Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] writes that the list was, however, of ghostly creatures without bodies, nothing like Tolkien's solid flesh-and-blood hobbits.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}}\n\n===Rabbit===\n\nAn additional connection is with [[rabbit]], one that Tolkien \"emphatically rejected\",{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}} although the word appears in ''The Hobbit'' in connection with other characters' opinions of Bilbo in several places.<ref name=\"O'Brien 1989\">{{cite journal |last1=O'Brien |first1=Donald |title=On the Origin of the Name \"Hobbit\" |journal=Mythlore |date=15 December 1989 |volume=16 |issue=2 |page=Article 19 |url=https://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol16/iss2/19}}</ref> Bilbo compares himself to a rabbit when he is with the eagle that carries him; the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagle]], too, tells Bilbo not to be \"frightened like a rabbit\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}} The giant bear-man [[Beorn]] teases Bilbo and jokes that \"little bunny is getting nice and fat again\", while the dwarf [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin]] shakes Bilbo \"like a rabbit\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}} \n\nShippey writes that rabbit is not a native English species, but was deliberately introduced in the 13th century, and has become accepted as a local wild animal. Shippey compares this \"situation of [[anachronism]]-cum-familiarity\" with the lifestyle of the hobbit, giving the example of smoking \"pipeweed\". He argues that Tolkien did not want to write \"[[tobacco]]\", as it did not arrive until the 16th century, so Tolkien invented a [[calque]] made of English words.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}} \nDonald O'Brien notes, too, that [[Aragorn]]'s description of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s priceless ''[[mithril]]'' [[Chain mail|mail]]-shirt, \"here's a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elven]]-princeling in\", is a \"curious echo\"<ref name=\"O'Brien 1989\"/> of the English [[nursery rhyme]] \"[[Bye, baby Bunting|To find a pretty rabbit-skin to wrap the baby bunting in]].\"<ref name=\"O'Brien 1989\"/>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ [[Tom Shippey]]'s analysis of the parallels between \"Hobbit\" and \"Rabbit\"{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}}\n|-\n!

They dress in bright colours, favouring yellow and green. Nowadays (according to Tolkien's fiction), they are usually shy, but are nevertheless capable of great courage and amazing feats under the proper circumstances. They are adept at throwing stones. For the most part, they cannot grow beards, but a few of the race of Stoor can. Their feet are covered with curly hair (usually brown, as is the hair on their heads) with leathery soles, so hobbits hardly ever wear shoes. The race's average life expectancy is 100 years. Two hobbits, [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the Old Took, are described as living to the age of 130 or beyond, though Bilbo's long lifespan owes much to his possession of the One Ring. Hobbits are considered to \"come of age\" on their 33rd birthday, so a 50-year-old hobbit would be regarded as entering middle-age.\n\nHobbits are not quite as stocky as the similarly-sized dwarves, but still tend to be stout, with slightly pointed ears. Tolkien does not describe hobbits' ears in ''The Hobbit'' or ''The Lord of the Rings'', but in a 1938 letter to his American publisher, he described them as having \"ears only slightly pointed and 'elvish'\".<ref name=\"Letter 27\" group=T/> Tolkien describes hobbits thus:\n\n{{quote|I picture a fairly human figure, not a kind of 'fairy' rabbit as some of my British reviewers seem to fancy: fattish in the stomach, shortish in the leg. A round, jovial face; ears only slightly pointed and 'elvish'; hair short and curling (brown). The feet from the ankles down, covered with brown hairy fur. Clothing: green velvet breeches; red or yellow waistcoat; brown or green jacket; gold (or brass) buttons; a dark green hood and cloak (belonging to a dwarf).<ref name=\"Letter 27\" group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=letter 27, specifically about Bilbo Baggins}}</ref>}}\n\nHobbits and derivative [[Halfling]]s are often depicted with unusually large feet for their size, perhaps to visually emphasize their unusualness. This is especially prominent in the influential illustrations by the [[Brothers Hildebrandt]] and the large prosthetic feet used in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]]. Tolkien does not specifically mention foot size as a generic hobbit trait, but does make it the distinctive trait of the Proudfoot hobbit family.\n\n{{anchor|Divisions}}\n\n==Types==\n\nOriginally, there were three types of hobbits, with different physical characteristics and temperaments: ''Harfoots'', ''Stoors'', and ''Fallohides''.\n\nThe Harfoots were the most numerous group of hobbits and were the first to enter [[Eriador]]. They were the smallest in stature, and the most typical of the race as described in ''The Hobbit''. They lived in [[Underground living|holes]], or smials, and had closer relations with [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] than did other hobbits. Tolkien coined the term as analogous to \"hairfoot\".<ref name=\"guide\" group=T/> \n\nThe Stoors were the second most numerous group of hobbits and the last to enter Eriador. They were stockier than other hobbits. They had an affinity for water, dwelt mostly beside [[river]]s, and were the only hobbits to use boats and swim. Males were able to grow beards. Tolkien says they were \"less shy of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]\". Many hobbits of [[Buckland (Middle-earth)|Buckland]] and the [[Marish]] in the Shire were Stoors, as were [[D\u00e9agol]] and [[Gollum|Sm\u00e9agol/Gollum]].<ref group=T>{{ME-ref|UT|Part Three, IV. \"The Hunt for the Ring\", p 353, note 9}}. In a letter quoted by Christopher Tolkien, Tolkien calls D\u00e9agol and Sm\u00e9agol Stoors.</ref> Tolkien used the [[Old English]] word ''stor'' or ''stoor'', meaning \"strong\".<ref name=\"guide\" group=T/>{{sfn|Clark Hall|2002|p=322}} \n\nThe Fallohides were the least numerous group and the second group to enter Eriador. They were generally fair-haired and tall (for hobbits). They preferred the forests and had links with the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], and were more adventurous than the other breeds. Wealthy prominent families, like the Tooks and Brandybucks, tended to be of Fallohide descent. Bilbo and three of the four principal hobbit characters in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (Frodo, Pippin, and Merry) had Fallohide blood through their common ancestor, the Old Took. Tolkien created the name from the archaic meanings of English words \"fallow\" and \"hide\", meaning \"pale skin\".<ref name=\"guide\" group=T>{{cite web |url=http://www.tolkien.ro/text/JRR%20Tolkien%20-%20Guide%20to%20the%20Names%20in%20The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings.pdf |title=Guide to the Names in ''The Lord of the Rings'' |last=Tolkien |first=J. R. R. |editor-last=Lobdell |editor-first=Jared |year=1975 |origyear=1967 |work=A Tolkien Compass |pages=155-201}}</ref>\n\n==Lifestyle and culture==\nIn his writings, Tolkien depicted hobbits as fond of an unadventurous, bucolic and [[simple living|simple life]] of farming, eating, and socializing, although capable of defending their homes courageously if the need arises. They would enjoy six meals a day, if they could get them.<ref>''The Fellowship of the Ring'', Prologue. \"And laugh they did, and eat, and drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of six meals a day (when they could get them).\"</ref> They were often described as enjoying simple food, though this seems to be of an [[Oxfordshire]] style, such as cake, bread, meat, potatoes, ale and tea. They claim to have invented the art of smoking [[pipe-weed]], and according to ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Return of The King'' it can be found all over Middle-earth. Like many peoples in Middle-earth, hobbits enjoyed singing, and some played musical instruments, including \"trumpets and horns, pipes and flutes\".\n\nThe hobbits of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] developed the custom of giving away gifts on their birthdays, instead of receiving them, although this custom was not universally followed among other hobbit cultures or communities.<ref>The hobbit Gollum refers to the [[One Ring]] as his \"birthday present\" in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.</ref> They use the term ''mathom'' for old and useless objects, which are invariably given as presents many times over, or are stored in a museum (''mathom-house'').\n\nThe hobbits had a [[Shire Calendar|distinct calendar]]: every year started on a Saturday and ended on a Friday, with each of the twelve months consisting of thirty days. [[Intercalary day|Some special days]] did not belong to any month\u2014[[Yule]] 1 and 2 (New Year's Eve & New Years Day) and three Lithedays in mid-summer. Every fourth year there was an extra Litheday, most likely as an adaptation, similar to a [[leap year]], to ensure that the calendar remained in synch with the seasons.<ref group=T>{{Me-ref|RotK| Appendix D}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hobbit holes reflected in water.jpg|thumb|Hobbit holes or smials as depicted in Peter Jackson's [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'']] film trilogy]]\n\nHobbits traditionally live in \"hobbit-holes\" or '''''smials''''', [[earth house|underground homes]] found in hillsides, downs, and banks. It has been suggested that the soil or ground of the Shire consists of [[loess]] and that this facilitates the construction of hobbit-holes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Smalley |first1=I.

According to ''The Lord of the Rings'', they have lost the genealogical details of how they are related to the [[Man (Middle-earth)|Big People]]. While situated in the valley of the [[Anduin River]], the hobbits lived close by the [[\u00c9oth\u00e9od]], the ancestors of the Rohirrim, and this led to some contact between the two. As a result, many old words and names in \"Hobbitish\" are derivatives of words in [[Rohirric]].\n\nThe [[Harfoot]]s lived on the lowest slopes of the Misty Mountains in hobbit holes dug into the hillsides. The [[Stoor]]s lived on the marshy [[Gladden Fields]] where the Gladden River met the Anduin; and the [[Fallohide]]s preferred to live in the woods under the Misty Mountains.\n\nAbout the year {{ME-date|TA|1050}}, the hobbits undertook the arduous task of crossing the Misty Mountains. Reasons for this trek are unknown, but they possibly had to do with [[Sauron]]'s growing power in nearby Greenwood, which later became known as Mirkwood as a result of the shadow that fell upon it during Sauron's search of the forest for the [[One Ring]]. The hobbits took different routes in their journey westward, but as they began to settle together in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree-land]], [[Dunland]], and the Angle formed by the rivers Mitheithel and [[Bruinen]], the divisions between the hobbit-kinds began to blur. The Tolkien critic [[Tom Shippey]] explains that the name \"Angle\" has a special resonance, as the name \"England\" comes from the Angle (Anglia) between the [[Flensburg Fjord]] and the [[Schlei|River Schlei]], in the north of Germany next to Denmark, the origin of the [[Angles (people)|Angles]] among the [[Anglo-Saxons]] who founded England.{{sfn|Shippey|2001|pp=198-199}}\n\nIn the year 1601 of the Third Age (year 1 in the Shire Reckoning), two Fallohide brothers named Marcho and Blanco gained permission from the King of Arnor at Fornost to cross the [[Baranduin|River Brandywine]] and settle on the other side. Many hobbits followed them, and most of the territory they had settled in the Third Age was abandoned. Only Bree and a few surrounding villages lasted to the end of the Third Age. The new land that they founded on the west bank of the Brandywine was called the Shire.\n\nOriginally the hobbits of the Shire swore nominal allegiance to the last Kings of Arnor, being required only to acknowledge their lordship, speed their messengers, and keep the bridges and roads in repair. During the final fight against [[Angmar]] at the Battle of Fornost, the hobbits maintain that they sent a company of archers to help but this is nowhere else recorded. After the battle, the kingdom of Arnor was destroyed, and in the absence of the king, the hobbits elected a [[Thain (Middle-earth)|Thain]] of the Shire from among their own chieftains.\n\nThe first Thain of the Shire was Bucca of the Marish, who founded the Oldbuck family. However, the Oldbuck family later crossed the Brandywine River to create the separate land of Buckland and the family name changed to the familiar \"Brandybuck\". Their patriarch then became Master of Buckland. With the departure of the Oldbucks/Brandybucks, a new family was selected to have its chieftains be Thain: the Took family (Pippin Took was son of the Thain and would later become Thain himself). The Thain was in charge of Shire Moot and Muster and the Hobbitry-in-Arms, but as the hobbits of the Shire generally led entirely peaceful, uneventful lives the office of Thain came to be seen as something of a formality.\n\n==Moral significance==\n\nThe Tolkien critic [[Paul H. Kocher]] notes that Tolkien's literary techniques require readers to view hobbits as like humans, especially when placed under moral pressure to survive a war that threatens to devastate their land.{{sfn|Kocher|1972|p=118}} [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] becomes in some ways the symbolic representation of the conscience of hobbits, a point made explicitly in the story \"[[Leaf by Niggle]]\" which Tolkien wrote at the same time as the first nine chapters of ''The Lord of the Rings''.{{sfn|Kocher|1972|pp=161\u2013169. \"These chapters brought Frodo and his hobbit friends as far as the inn at Bree.\"}} Niggle is a painter struggling against the summons of death to complete his one great canvas, a picture of a tree with a background of forest and distant mountains. He dies with the work incomplete, undone by his imperfectly generous heart: \"it made him uncomfortable more often than it made him do anything\". After discipline in [[Purgatory]], however, Niggle finds himself in the very landscape depicted by his painting which he is now able to finish with the assistance of a neighbour who obstructed him during life. The picture complete, Niggle is free to journey to the distant mountains which represent the highest stage of his spiritual development.<ref>JRR Tolkien. ''Leaf by Niggle''. Dublin Review. 1945. January. p. 216.</ref> Thus, upon recovery from the wound inflicted by the Witch-King of Angmar on [[Weathertop]], [[Gandalf]] speculates that the hobbit Frodo \"may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can\".{{sfn|Kocher|1972|p=120}} Similarly, as Frodo nears [[Mount Doom]] he casts aside weapons and refuses to fight others with physical force: \"For him struggles for the right must hereafter be waged only on the moral plane.\"{{sfn|Kocher|1972|p=120}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|Halfling|Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)}}\n\nOriginally, ''[[wikt:halfling|halfling]]'' comes from the [[Scots language|Scots]] word ''hauflin'', meaning an awkward rustic teenager, who is neither man nor boy, and so half of both.

R. R. Tolkien]]. About half the height of humans, they are also referred to as [[Halfling]]s. They live barefooted, and live in underground houses which have windows, as they are typically built into the sides of hills.\n\nHobbits first appeared in the 1937 children's novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', whose titular hobbit is the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]], who is thrown into an unexpected adventure involving a [[dragon]]. In its sequel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the hobbits [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Sam Gamgee]], [[Pippin Took]], and [[Merry Brandybuck]] are primary characters. Hobbits are briefly mentioned in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', which are set in the same fictional world, [[Middle-earth]].\n\nAccording to the prologue to ''The Lord of the Rings'', hobbits are \"relatives\"<ref group=T>Tolkien: ''The Fellowship of the Ring''. Prologue. \"It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement, hobbits are relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves. [...] But what exactly our relationship is can no longer be discovered.\"</ref> of the [[race (fantasy)|race]] of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]. Elsewhere, Tolkien describes hobbits as a \"variety\"<ref name=\"variety\" group=T>Tolkien, J. R. R. ''Guide to the Names of the Lord of the Rings'', \"The Firstborn\"</ref> or separate \"branch\"<ref name=\"branch\" group=T>Carpenter: ''The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien'', #131</ref> of humans. Hobbits and other races seem aware of the similarities (hence the colloquial terms \"Big People\" and \"Little People\" used in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]). However, hobbits considered themselves a separate people.<ref group=T>Tolkien: ''The Fellowship of the Ring''. Many Meetings. \u201cIf you can\u2019t distinguish between a Man and a Hobbit, your judgement is poorer than I imagined. They\u2019re as different as peas and apples.\u201d</ref> At the time of the events in ''The Lord of the Rings'', hobbits lived in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] and in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]] in the north west of Middle-earth, though by the end, some had moved out to the [[Tower Hills]] and to [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]].\n\n==Origins==\n{{further|Hobbit (word)}}\n \nTolkien claimed that he started ''The Hobbit'' suddenly, without premeditation, in the midst of grading a set of student essay exams, writing on a blank piece of paper: \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit\".<ref>Carpenter: ''J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography'', p. 172</ref> \n\n===Fictional etymology===\n\nTolkien set out a fictional [[etymology]] for the [[Hobbit (word)|word \"hobbit\"]] in an appendix to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', to the effect that it was ultimately derived from ''holbytla'' (plural ''holbytlan''), meaning \"hole-builder\".<ref name=annot group=T>{{cite book |title=The Annotated Hobbit: The Hobbit, or, There and Back Again |url=https://archive.org/details/annotatedhobbith0000tolk |url-access=registration |first=John Ronald Reuel |last=Tolkien |editor=Douglas Anderson |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1988 |isbn=0-395-47690-9}}</ref><ref name=\"EncycArda\"/> This was Tolkien's own new construction from [[Old English]] ''hol'', \"a hole or hollow\", and ''bytlan'', \"to build\".<ref name=\"Clark Hall 2002\">{{cite book |last1=Clark Hall |first1=J.

One is a fact that Tolkien admitted:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Letter_to_Harry_C._Bauer|title=Letter to Harry C. Bauer - Tolkien Gateway |website=tolkiengateway.net |access-date=1 January 2020}}</ref> the title of [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s 1922 novel ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'', about a \"complacent American businessman\" who goes through a journey of some kind of self-discovery, facing \"near-disgrace; the critic [[Tom Shippey]] observes that there are some parallels here with Bilbo's own journey.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}}\n\nAccording to a letter from Tolkien to [[W. H. Auden]], one \"probably .. unconscious\" inspiration was [[Edward Wyke Smith]]'s 1927 children's book ''[[The Marvellous Land of Snergs]]''.<ref name=annot group=T/> Tolkien described the Snergs as \"a race of people only slightly taller than the average table but broad in the shoulders and [who] have the strength of ten men.\"{{sfn|Carpenter|1977|p=165}}\n\n===Earlier uses===\n\nAnother possible origin emerged in 1977 when the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' announced that it had found the source that it supposed Tolkien to have used: J. Hardy wrote in his 1895 ''The Denham Tracts, Volume 2'': \"The whole earth was overrun with ghosts, boggles ... hobbits, hobgoblins.\" The Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] writes that the list was, however, of ghostly creatures without bodies, nothing like Tolkien's solid flesh-and-blood hobbits.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}}\n\n===Rabbit===\n\nAn additional connection is with [[rabbit]], one that Tolkien \"emphatically rejected\",{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}} although the word appears in ''The Hobbit'' in connection with other characters' opinions of Bilbo in several places.<ref name=\"O'Brien 1989\">{{cite journal |last1=O'Brien |first1=Donald |title=On the Origin of the Name \"Hobbit\" |journal=Mythlore |date=15 December 1989 |volume=16 |issue=2 |page=Article 19 |url=https://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol16/iss2/19}}</ref> Bilbo compares himself to a rabbit when he is with the eagle that carries him; the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagle]], too, tells Bilbo not to be \"frightened like a rabbit\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}} The giant bear-man [[Beorn]] teases Bilbo and jokes that \"little bunny is getting nice and fat again\", while the dwarf [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin]] shakes Bilbo \"like a rabbit\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}} \n\nShippey writes that rabbit is not a native English species, but was deliberately introduced in the 13th century, and has become accepted as a local wild animal. Shippey compares this \"situation of [[anachronism]]-cum-familiarity\" with the lifestyle of the hobbit, giving the example of smoking \"pipeweed\". He argues that Tolkien did not want to write \"[[tobacco]]\", as it did not arrive until the 16th century, so Tolkien invented a [[calque]] made of English words.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}} \nDonald O'Brien notes, too, that [[Aragorn]]'s description of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s priceless ''[[mithril]]'' [[Chain mail|mail]]-shirt, \"here's a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elven]]-princeling in\", is a \"curious echo\"<ref name=\"O'Brien 1989\"/> of the English [[nursery rhyme]] \"[[Bye, baby Bunting|To find a pretty rabbit-skin to wrap the baby bunting in]].\"<ref name=\"O'Brien 1989\"/>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ [[Tom Shippey]]'s analysis of the parallels between \"Hobbit\" and \"Rabbit\"{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=76-78}}\n|-\n!

They dress in bright colours, favouring yellow and green. Nowadays (according to Tolkien's fiction), they are usually shy, but are nevertheless capable of great courage and amazing feats under the proper circumstances. They are adept at throwing stones. For the most part, they cannot grow beards, but a few of the race of Stoor can. Their feet are covered with curly hair (usually brown, as is the hair on their heads) with leathery soles, so hobbits hardly ever wear shoes. The race's average life expectancy is 100 years. Two hobbits, [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the Old Took, are described as living to the age of 130 or beyond, though Bilbo's long lifespan owes much to his possession of the One Ring. Hobbits are considered to \"come of age\" on their 33rd birthday, so a 50-year-old hobbit would be regarded as entering middle-age.\n\nHobbits are not quite as stocky as the similarly-sized dwarves, but still tend to be stout, with slightly pointed ears. Tolkien does not describe hobbits' ears in ''The Hobbit'' or ''The Lord of the Rings'', but in a 1938 letter to his American publisher, he described them as having \"ears only slightly pointed and 'elvish'\".<ref name=\"Letter 27\" group=T/> Tolkien describes hobbits thus:\n\n{{quote|I picture a fairly human figure, not a kind of 'fairy' rabbit as some of my British reviewers seem to fancy: fattish in the stomach, shortish in the leg. A round, jovial face; ears only slightly pointed and 'elvish'; hair short and curling (brown). The feet from the ankles down, covered with brown hairy fur. Clothing: green velvet breeches; red or yellow waistcoat; brown or green jacket; gold (or brass) buttons; a dark green hood and cloak (belonging to a dwarf).<ref name=\"Letter 27\" group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|loc=letter 27, specifically about Bilbo Baggins}}</ref>}}\n\nHobbits and derivative [[Halfling]]s are often depicted with unusually large feet for their size, perhaps to visually emphasize their unusualness. This is especially prominent in the influential illustrations by the [[Brothers Hildebrandt]] and the large prosthetic feet used in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]]. Tolkien does not specifically mention foot size as a generic hobbit trait, but does make it the distinctive trait of the Proudfoot hobbit family.\n\n{{anchor|Divisions}}\n\n==Types==\n\nOriginally, there were three types of hobbits, with different physical characteristics and temperaments: ''Harfoots'', ''Stoors'', and ''Fallohides''.\n\nThe Harfoots were the most numerous group of hobbits and were the first to enter [[Eriador]]. They were the smallest in stature, and the most typical of the race as described in ''The Hobbit''. They lived in [[Underground living|holes]], or smials, and had closer relations with [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] than did other hobbits. Tolkien coined the term as analogous to \"hairfoot\".<ref name=\"guide\" group=T/> \n\nThe Stoors were the second most numerous group of hobbits and the last to enter Eriador. They were stockier than other hobbits. They had an affinity for water, dwelt mostly beside [[river]]s, and were the only hobbits to use boats and swim. Males were able to grow beards. Tolkien says they were \"less shy of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]\". Many hobbits of [[Buckland (Middle-earth)|Buckland]] and the [[Marish]] in the Shire were Stoors, as were [[D\u00e9agol]] and [[Gollum|Sm\u00e9agol/Gollum]].<ref group=T>{{ME-ref|UT|Part Three, IV. \"The Hunt for the Ring\", p 353, note 9}}. In a letter quoted by Christopher Tolkien, Tolkien calls D\u00e9agol and Sm\u00e9agol Stoors.</ref> Tolkien used the [[Old English]] word ''stor'' or ''stoor'', meaning \"strong\".<ref name=\"guide\" group=T/>{{sfn|Clark Hall|2002|p=322}} \n\nThe Fallohides were the least numerous group and the second group to enter Eriador. They were generally fair-haired and tall (for hobbits). They preferred the forests and had links with the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], and were more adventurous than the other breeds. Wealthy prominent families, like the Tooks and Brandybucks, tended to be of Fallohide descent. Bilbo and three of the four principal hobbit characters in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (Frodo, Pippin, and Merry) had Fallohide blood through their common ancestor, the Old Took. Tolkien created the name from the archaic meanings of English words \"fallow\" and \"hide\", meaning \"pale skin\".<ref name=\"guide\" group=T>{{cite web |url=http://www.tolkien.ro/text/JRR%20Tolkien%20-%20Guide%20to%20the%20Names%20in%20The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings.pdf |title=Guide to the Names in ''The Lord of the Rings'' |last=Tolkien |first=J. R. R. |editor-last=Lobdell |editor-first=Jared |year=1975 |origyear=1967 |work=A Tolkien Compass |pages=155-201}}</ref>\n\n==Lifestyle and culture==\nIn his writings, Tolkien depicted hobbits as fond of an unadventurous, bucolic and [[simple living|simple life]] of farming, eating, and socializing, although capable of defending their homes courageously if the need arises. They would enjoy six meals a day, if they could get them.<ref>''The Fellowship of the Ring'', Prologue. \"And laugh they did, and eat, and drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of six meals a day (when they could get them).\"</ref> They were often described as enjoying simple food, though this seems to be of an [[Oxfordshire]] style, such as cake, bread, meat, potatoes, ale and tea. They claim to have invented the art of smoking [[pipe-weed]], and according to ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Return of The King'' it can be found all over Middle-earth. Like many peoples in Middle-earth, hobbits enjoyed singing, and some played musical instruments, including \"trumpets and horns, pipes and flutes\".\n\nThe hobbits of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] developed the custom of giving away gifts on their birthdays, instead of receiving them, although this custom was not universally followed among other hobbit cultures or communities.<ref>The hobbit Gollum refers to the [[One Ring]] as his \"birthday present\" in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.</ref> They use the term ''mathom'' for old and useless objects, which are invariably given as presents many times over, or are stored in a museum (''mathom-house'').\n\nThe hobbits had a [[Shire Calendar|distinct calendar]]: every year started on a Saturday and ended on a Friday, with each of the twelve months consisting of thirty days. [[Intercalary day|Some special days]] did not belong to any month\u2014[[Yule]] 1 and 2 (New Year's Eve & New Years Day) and three Lithedays in mid-summer. Every fourth year there was an extra Litheday, most likely as an adaptation, similar to a [[leap year]], to ensure that the calendar remained in synch with the seasons.<ref group=T>{{Me-ref|RotK| Appendix D}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hobbit holes reflected in water.jpg|thumb|Hobbit holes or smials as depicted in Peter Jackson's [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'']] film trilogy]]\n\nHobbits traditionally live in \"hobbit-holes\" or '''''smials''''', [[earth house|underground homes]] found in hillsides, downs, and banks. It has been suggested that the soil or ground of the Shire consists of [[loess]] and that this facilitates the construction of hobbit-holes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Smalley |first1=I.

According to ''The Lord of the Rings'', they have lost the genealogical details of how they are related to the [[Man (Middle-earth)|Big People]]. While situated in the valley of the [[Anduin River]], the hobbits lived close by the [[\u00c9oth\u00e9od]], the ancestors of the Rohirrim, and this led to some contact between the two. As a result, many old words and names in \"Hobbitish\" are derivatives of words in [[Rohirric]].\n\nThe [[Harfoot]]s lived on the lowest slopes of the Misty Mountains in hobbit holes dug into the hillsides. The [[Stoor]]s lived on the marshy [[Gladden Fields]] where the Gladden River met the Anduin; and the [[Fallohide]]s preferred to live in the woods under the Misty Mountains.\n\nAbout the year {{ME-date|TA|1050}}, the hobbits undertook the arduous task of crossing the Misty Mountains. Reasons for this trek are unknown, but they possibly had to do with [[Sauron]]'s growing power in nearby Greenwood, which later became known as Mirkwood as a result of the shadow that fell upon it during Sauron's search of the forest for the [[One Ring]]. The hobbits took different routes in their journey westward, but as they began to settle together in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree-land]], [[Dunland]], and the Angle formed by the rivers Mitheithel and [[Bruinen]], the divisions between the hobbit-kinds began to blur. The Tolkien critic [[Tom Shippey]] explains that the name \"Angle\" has a special resonance, as the name \"England\" comes from the Angle (Anglia) between the [[Flensburg Fjord]] and the [[Schlei|River Schlei]], in the north of Germany next to Denmark, the origin of the [[Angles (people)|Angles]] among the [[Anglo-Saxons]] who founded England.{{sfn|Shippey|2001|pp=198-199}}\n\nIn the year 1601 of the Third Age (year 1 in the Shire Reckoning), two Fallohide brothers named Marcho and Blanco gained permission from the King of Arnor at Fornost to cross the [[Baranduin|River Brandywine]] and settle on the other side. Many hobbits followed them, and most of the territory they had settled in the Third Age was abandoned. Only Bree and a few surrounding villages lasted to the end of the Third Age. The new land that they founded on the west bank of the Brandywine was called the Shire.\n\nOriginally the hobbits of the Shire swore nominal allegiance to the last Kings of Arnor, being required only to acknowledge their lordship, speed their messengers, and keep the bridges and roads in repair. During the final fight against [[Angmar]] at the Battle of Fornost, the hobbits maintain that they sent a company of archers to help but this is nowhere else recorded. After the battle, the kingdom of Arnor was destroyed, and in the absence of the king, the hobbits elected a [[Thain (Middle-earth)|Thain]] of the Shire from among their own chieftains.\n\nThe first Thain of the Shire was Bucca of the Marish, who founded the Oldbuck family. However, the Oldbuck family later crossed the Brandywine River to create the separate land of Buckland and the family name changed to the familiar \"Brandybuck\". Their patriarch then became Master of Buckland. With the departure of the Oldbucks/Brandybucks, a new family was selected to have its chieftains be Thain: the Took family (Pippin Took was son of the Thain and would later become Thain himself). The Thain was in charge of Shire Moot and Muster and the Hobbitry-in-Arms, but as the hobbits of the Shire generally led entirely peaceful, uneventful lives the office of Thain came to be seen as something of a formality.\n\n==Moral significance==\n\nThe Tolkien critic [[Paul H. Kocher]] notes that Tolkien's literary techniques require readers to view hobbits as like humans, especially when placed under moral pressure to survive a war that threatens to devastate their land.{{sfn|Kocher|1972|p=118}} [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] becomes in some ways the symbolic representation of the conscience of hobbits, a point made explicitly in the story \"[[Leaf by Niggle]]\" which Tolkien wrote at the same time as the first nine chapters of ''The Lord of the Rings''.{{sfn|Kocher|1972|pp=161\u2013169. \"These chapters brought Frodo and his hobbit friends as far as the inn at Bree.\"}} Niggle is a painter struggling against the summons of death to complete his one great canvas, a picture of a tree with a background of forest and distant mountains. He dies with the work incomplete, undone by his imperfectly generous heart: \"it made him uncomfortable more often than it made him do anything\". After discipline in [[Purgatory]], however, Niggle finds himself in the very landscape depicted by his painting which he is now able to finish with the assistance of a neighbour who obstructed him during life. The picture complete, Niggle is free to journey to the distant mountains which represent the highest stage of his spiritual development.<ref>JRR Tolkien. ''Leaf by Niggle''. Dublin Review. 1945. January. p. 216.</ref> Thus, upon recovery from the wound inflicted by the Witch-King of Angmar on [[Weathertop]], [[Gandalf]] speculates that the hobbit Frodo \"may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can\".{{sfn|Kocher|1972|p=120}} Similarly, as Frodo nears [[Mount Doom]] he casts aside weapons and refuses to fight others with physical force: \"For him struggles for the right must hereafter be waged only on the moral plane.\"{{sfn|Kocher|1972|p=120}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|Halfling|Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)}}\n\nOriginally, ''[[wikt:halfling|halfling]]'' comes from the [[Scots language|Scots]] word ''hauflin'', meaning an awkward rustic teenager, who is neither man nor boy, and so half of both. Another word for halfling is ''[[wikt:hobbledehoy|hobbledehoy]]'' or ''[[wikt:hobby#English|hobby]]''.
