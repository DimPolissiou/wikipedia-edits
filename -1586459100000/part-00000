Holly Evans was the [[bailiff]] from 1998 to 2006. Sonia Montejano replaced her for the rest of the run in 2006. Jacque Kessler was the show's news reporter from 1998 to 2010. Former [[Fox Sports]] and current [[MLB Network]] freelance reporter [[Jeanne Zelasko]] succeeded Kessler as the reporter in 2010. [[Ben Patrick Johnson]] was the show's announcer from 1998 to 2005. [[Rolonda Watts]] succeeded him as announcer in 2005. Popular musicians [[Coolio]], [[Ike Turner]], and [[Rick James]] have all been [[wiktionary:litigant|litigants]] on the show.  As of 2014, Sonia Montejano now serves as the bailiff on the new panel court series ''[[Hot Bench]]'', while Rolonda Watts now announces the long running series, ''[[Divorce Court]]''.\n\n==Salary==\nIt was reported in mid-2012 that Brown was the second highest paid daytime television personality, earning $20 million a year, only second to Judge Judy, who earns $45 million a year.<ref name=Findlaw>{{cite news|last=Chow|first=Andrew|title=Judge Judy, Judge Joe Brown Among TV's Top-Paid Stars|url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/celebrity_justice/2012/08/judge-judy-judge-joe-brown-among-tvs-top-paid-stars.html|accessdate=September 12, 2013|newspaper=[[Findlaw]]|date=August 14, 2012}}</ref>  In April 2013, however, following the show's cancellation, Brown disputed these reports claiming that CTD was only paying him $5 million a year.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2013/04/11/judge-judy-contract/|title=Judge Judy: 4 More Years And $180 Million?|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=April 11, 2013|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Cancellation==\nAs reported on February 27, 2013, by ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', CTD had told Brown that the salary amount they were paying him\u2013of $20 million (though Brown disputed this, claiming that CTD had never given him a salary of any more than $5 million<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>)\u2013would be cut in the wake of his declining ratings, license fees, and advertising revenues.\n\nRatings for ''Judge Joe Brown'' were declining during its last several seasons on the air.

In fact, in February 2010, Brown himself was [[sued]] by one of his former television show litigants for [[allegation|alleged]] slander and fraud,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/02/22/judge-joe-brown-sued-nookie-case-lawsuit-tv-television-court-show/ |title=Judge Joe Brown Sued in 'Nookie' Case|publisher=TMZ.com|date=February 22, 2010|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}</ref> but won the case because of the [[waiver|waivers]] the court show had its litigants sign prior to the televised proceedings.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=Eriq|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/30/us-joebrown-idUSTRE66T0OU20100730|title=Judge Joe Brown wins ruling in his own lawsuit|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=July 30, 2010|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}</ref> On the series, Brown had typically responded to most of the aforementioned behaviors by telling the litigants they'd be receiving a ticket or demanding that the litigant be [[arrested]] and thrown in [[prison|jail]] for violating a [[statute]] that requires proper behavior and decorum in arbitration.\n\n==Recurring roles==\nThe program also featured a news reporter and bailiff. Holly Evans was the [[bailiff]] from 1998 to 2006. Sonia Montejano replaced her for the rest of the run in 2006. Jacque Kessler was the show's news reporter from 1998 to 2010. Former [[Fox Sports]] and current [[MLB Network]] freelance reporter [[Jeanne Zelasko]] succeeded Kessler as the reporter in 2010. [[Ben Patrick Johnson]] was the show's announcer from 1998 to 2005. [[Rolonda Watts]] succeeded him as announcer in 2005. Popular musicians [[Coolio]], [[Ike Turner]], and [[Rick James]] have all been [[wiktionary:litigant|litigants]] on the show.  As of 2014, Sonia Montejano now serves as the bailiff on the new panel court series ''[[Hot Bench]]'', while Rolonda Watts now announces the long running series, ''[[Divorce Court]]''.\n\n==Salary==\nIt was reported in mid-2012 that Brown was the second highest paid daytime television personality, earning $20 million a year, only second to Judge Judy, who earns $45 million a year.<ref name=Findlaw>{{cite news|last=Chow|first=Andrew|title=Judge Judy, Judge Joe Brown Among TV's Top-Paid Stars|url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/celebrity_justice/2012/08/judge-judy-judge-joe-brown-among-tvs-top-paid-stars.html|accessdate=September 12, 2013|newspaper=[[Findlaw]]|date=August 14, 2012}}</ref>  In April 2013, however, following the show's cancellation, Brown disputed these reports claiming that CTD was only paying him $5 million a year.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2013/04/11/judge-judy-contract/|title=Judge Judy: 4 More Years And $180 Million?|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=April 11, 2013|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Cancellation==\nAs reported on February 27, 2013, by ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', CTD had told Brown that the salary amount they were paying him\u2013of $20 million (though Brown disputed this, claiming that CTD had never given him a salary of any more than $5 million<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>)\u2013would be cut in the wake of his declining ratings, license fees, and advertising revenues.\n\nRatings for ''Judge Joe Brown'' were declining during its last several seasons on the air. In the 2013 February [[Nielsen ratings#sweeps|sweeps]], the show was down 20% to a 2.4 live plus same day rating from a 3.0 last year according to Nielsen Media Research. Brown refused to do the show under the new terms.

{"title_page": "Heinrich Brandler", "text_new": "'''Heinrich Brandler''' (3 July 1881 \u2013 26 September 1967) was a [[Germany|German]] [[communism|communist]] [[trade union]]ist, politician, revolutionary activist, and writer. Brandler is best remembered as the head of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) during the party's ill-fated \"March Action\" of 1921 and aborted uprising of 1923, for which he was held responsible by the [[Communist International]]. Expelled from the Communist Party in December 1928, Brandler went on to become co-founder of the [[Communist Party Opposition|Communist Party of Germany Opposition]], the first national section of the so-called [[International Right Opposition]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\nHeinrich Brandler was born July 3, 1881 to an ethnic [[Austrians|Austrian]] working-class family in [[Varnsdorf]], [[Bohemia]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]].<ref>This region was known in Germany as [[Sudetenland]].</ref> Heinrich's father, Joseph Brandler, was a [[bricklayer]] by trade, and he taught his son the craft from an early age.<ref name=\"Lane\">Klaus Sch\u00f6enhoven, \"Heinrich Brandler,\" in A. Thomas Lane (ed.), ''Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders: A-L.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995; pp. 130-131.</ref> After completing his elementary education, Heinrich traveled Europe for several years as a [[journeyman]] tiler and bricklayer.\n\nBrandler was active in the German [[trade union]] movement from 1897.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\">Pierre Brou\u00e9, ''The German Revolution, 1917-1923.'' (1971) John Archer, trans. Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2006; pp. 960-961.</ref> Early in his working career, Brandler was injured in a job-related accident which caused him to walk with a limp for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" />\n\n===Rise to political power===\nBrandler joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in 1901, while living in the city of [[Hamburg, Germany|Hamburg]] and taking an active part in the leadership of the construction workers' union there.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> In 1904 he moved to [[Bremen]], where he remained through 1908 as an activist both in union and political affairs. Brandler associated with the left wing of the SPD and was sympathetic to the views of [[Karl Liebknecht]], which often brought him into conflict with more cautious and temperate members of the party and union organizations.<ref name=\"Lazitch\">Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition.'' Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pp. 42-43.</ref>\n\nFrom there, Brandler moved to [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], remaining there from 1908 to 1914.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> While in Switzerland, Brandler worked during the summer building season as a [[stonemason]] and further supplemented his income as a socialist lecturer and teacher.<ref name=\"Lane\" />\n\nBrandler returned to Germany in 1914, just prior to the outbreak of [[World War I]], settling in [[Chemnitz]] as secretary of the building workers' union. Brandler was militant in his opposition to the war, joining the International Group of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]] \u2014 factional activity which ran him afoul of the SPD leadership and ultimately led to his expulsion from the SPD in 1915, along with [[Fritz Heckert]].<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> Brandler was named the delegate of the International Group to the first [[Zimmerwald Conference]] but was stopped by the police at the Swiss border and was unable to attend.<ref name=\"Lazitch\" />\n\nOn January 1, 1916, Brandler was a founding member of the [[Spartacist League]], the formal organization springing from the already-existing International Group.\n\nIn October 1918, Brandler was arrested for illegal political activities and was temporarily deported from Germany, owing to his Austrian citizenship.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> He subsequently obtained German nationality status through [[Gerhard Eisner|Gerhard Eisner's]] government in [[Bavaria]], which allowed his return.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> Brandler was a founding member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) in December of that same year. He was elected to the party's National Committee at the organization's 2nd Congress, held in 1919.<ref name=\"Lazitch\" /> Brandler thus became one of the few members of the [[working class]] itself in the active leadership of the German Communist Party.<ref>E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-1923, Volume 3.'' London: Macmillan, 1953; pg. 170.</ref>\n\nHome in Chemnitz, Brandler established a communist newspaper called ''Der K\u00e4mpfer'' (The Fighter) and helped build a powerful local unit of the KPD.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> He organized workers' councils in Chemnitz immediately after the failure of the ultra-nationalist [[Kapp Putsch]] of 1920.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> On March 15, 1920, Brandler and other Chemnitz communists joined the local social democrats in proclaiming a Soviet government for common defense against the [[nationalism|nationalists]]. This proved to be an ephemeral institution which faded away after a few days when the generals and their government were ousted from [[Berlin]].<ref>Carr, ''The Bolshevik Revolution,'' vol. 3, pg. 173.</ref>\n\nHe was elected to the governing executive body of the KPD in 1920 and reported to the party's Unification Congress on organizational matters later that year.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" />\n\nAided by [[Comintern]] pressure, Brandler's faction took over leadership of the KPD in 1921, with Brandler replacing [[Paul Levi]] as KPD Chairman in February.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> Brandler was leader of the party during the KPD's ill-fated \"[[March Action]]\" of 1921, a role which placed him on a collision course with civil authorities following the failure of the uprising. In June 1921, Brandler was convicted in a [[treason]] trial and sentenced to five years' imprisonment in a fortress. The term was ended abruptly in November of that same year, after which Brandler left for [[Moscow]], where he sat on the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] (ECCI) on behalf of the German party.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> Brandler was elected to the ECCI Presidium at its [[1st Enlarged Plenum of ECCI|First Enlarged Plenum]] in February 1922.<ref name=\"Lazitch\" /> Brandler was also active in the affairs of the [[Red International of Labor Unions]] (Profintern) during this interval.<ref name=\"Lane\" />\n\n===Role in the failed 1923 revolution===\n\nBrandler returned to Germany in the August 1922, assuming once again the role of top leader of the German Communist Party,<ref name=\"Lazitch\" /> a position temporarily held by factional ally [[Ernst Meyer (German politician)|Ernst Meyer]]. Brandler, [[August Thalheimer]], and the KPD \"Right\" were soon at odds with the party's left wing, chiefly over the issues of the [[united front]] and the role of the communists in [[coalition government]]s. With respect to the united front, Brandler sought common cause not only with the rank and file but also with the leadership of other workers' parties, while the Left sought to implement a so-called \"united front from below\" by seeking to work with rank and file members in an attempt to turn them against their leaders. With respect to coalition government, Brandler and the Right deemed it permissible for the Communist Party to enter regional coalition governments with the Social Democrats, while the Left declared that any government not dominated by the Communist Party was unworthy of KPD participation.<ref>E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: The Interregnum, 1923-1924.'' London: Macmillan, 1954; pp. 157-158.</ref>\n\nAt the 8th Congress of the KPD, held in Leipzig on January 28, 1923, Brandler and Thalheimer's faction prevailed over the KPD Left, a group led by [[Ernst Thaelmann]], [[Arkadi Maslow]], and [[Ruth Fischer]]. Brandler's faction was the beneficiary of key support from [[Karl Radek]], a top leader of the Communist International.<ref>Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pg. 157.</ref> Brandler's position as head of the KPD was solidified and his tactical interpretation of the united front and coalition \"workers' government\" was affirmed.\n\nThe left wing of the KPD believed that a revolutionary situation existed in Germany in 1923 and anxiously pushed for the setting of a date for a general uprising on the Russian [[Bolshevik]] model. While giving support to this general idea in the party's councils, in private Brandler seems to have felt that Germany was no yet ripe for a revolution and he sought additional time to win a greater percentage of the German working class to the idea. In September 1923, Brandler returned to Moscow for consultations.<ref name=\"Lazitch\" /> At a secret meeting of the [[Politburo]] of the Russian Communist Party it was decided, at the insistence of [[Leon Trotsky]], to set November 7, 1923 \u2014 the sixth anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution \u2014 as the date for the German uprising.<ref>Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pp. 204-205.</ref> Brandler refused to accept the setting of this artificial future date, however, winning agreement that the final date of the uprising should be left to the German Communists themselves.<ref name=\"Carr4-206\">Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pg. 206.</ref>\n\nBrandler returned to Germany with plans for revolution in the offing. In [[Saxony]] the Social Democrats governed thanks to supporting votes by Communist delegates in the Landtag. It was understood that the Communists could claim a share of the ministerial portfolios if they so desired. Following Brandler's return, the Communist Party decided to exercise this option, doing the same in [[Thuringia]], where a similar situation existed. It was hoped that the Communists' place in the government would prove useful in course the forthcoming armed uprising.<ref name=\"Carr4-206\" /> Negotiations began for entry of the Communists into the government. Brandler remained reluctant to set the final date for the revolution, however, arguing that the time was still not ripe and that the masses remained to be mobilized.<ref>Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pg. 207.</ref>\n\nOn October 1, 1923, a [[telegram]] signed by Comintern President [[Grigory Zinoviev]] on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Comintern was dispatched to the national committee of the German Communist Party declaring that by its estimate \"the decisive moment will come in four, five, six weeks.\" The Communists were directed to \"carry out at once the arming of 50,000 to 60,000 men.\"<ref>Cited in Carr, ''The Intrregnum,'' pp. 207-208.</ref> This proved to be a fanciful estimate, however, as the party possessed no more than 11,000 rifles and the bulk of its armed forces were far away from [[Saxony]], where the proposed uprising was to be centered.<ref>Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pg. 211.</ref>\n\nExacerbating their weak numbers in terms of men and material, the Communists faced a substantial contingent of [[Reichswehr]], with superior training and armaments, as well as illegal right wing militias.<ref>Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pg. 212.</ref> The number of purported sympathizers among the regular officers corps was greatly exaggerated, as was the degree of support for the Communist project among the working class itself.<ref>Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pp. 212-213.</ref>\n\nIn 1923, Brandler was responsible for calling off a planned revolutionary uprising following the defection of left-wing Social Democrats from the revolutionary group. An [[Hamburg uprising|ill-fated uprising]] continued in Hamburg, conducted when workers were not properly informed of the cancellation of the revolt. Brandler and his close associate [[August Thalheimer]] were largely blamed for this debacle by the [[Comintern]] and his career as leader of the German Communist movement was effectively ended. He was recalled to the [[Soviet Union]] by the Comintern in January 1924, and he remained that country for the best part of the next four years.<ref name=\"Lazitch\" /> \n\nThe disgraced Brandler was sent on a party task to [[Kazakhstan]] in [[Soviet Central Asia]], where he remained until being partially restored to the Comintern's good graces sometime in 1926.<ref name=\"Lane\" /> This respite proved to be short-lived. Brandler and his associates were harsh critics of new German Communist Party leader [[Ernst Thaelmann]], an individual stoutly supported by the ever more powerful Russian Communist Party leadership.<ref>Robert J. Alexander, ''The Right Opposition: The Lovestoneites and the International Communist Opposition of the 1930s.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1981; pg. 135.</ref> Brandler again became the object of harsh criticism for factional activity at the [[7th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI]] in the winter of 1926, ending with a specific prohibition of his continuing further work in the German Communist Party.<ref name=\"Lazitch\" />\n\n[[File:Brandler-pub.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cover of ''Gegen den Strom,'' official publication of the \"Brandlerite\" Communist Party of Germany (Opposition).]]\n\n===Expulsion and communist oppositional activities===\n\nIn the fall of 1928 an event ([[Wittorf affair]]) took place in the Communist Party of Germany which ultimately led to the final break of Brandler and Thalheimer and their supporters. The secretary of the Hamburg organization of the KPD was found to have embezzled 2,000 marks from the party treasury for his own use. When accountants from national party headquarters discovered the crime, they had been threatened with expulsion from the party by party leader Thaelmann if they exposed the theft. The Comintern got wind of the scandal which led to a crisis in the German party with the Central Committee acting to remove Thaelmann, with Thaelmann joining in the unanimous vote.<ref name=\"Alexander136\">Alexander, ''The Right Opposition,'' pg. 136.</ref>\n\nThis presented a threat to the faction of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by [[Joseph Stalin]], who saw in Thaelmann a reliable ally during a time of bitter factional warfare. As a result, the Presidium of the Comintern countermanded the German Central Committee's action, restoring Thaelmann as secretary.<ref name=\"Alexander136\" />\n\nIn October 1928 Brandler returned to Germany against the KPD's wishes.

The group also launched a new communist opposition journal, ''Gegen den Strom'' (Against the Current).<ref name=\"Lazitch\" /> \n\nThroughout 1929 the KPD expelled followers of Brandler and Thalheimer, as well as so-called \"conciliators\" who sought a factional truce between the party's feuding Left and Right.

Brandler lived in [[Paris]] until the beginning of [[World War II]], where he continued to be involved in communist politics.

Brandler is best remembered as the head of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) during the party's ill-fated \"March Action\" of 1921 and aborted uprising of 1923, for which he was held responsible by the [[Communist International]]. Expelled from the Communist Party in December 1928, Brandler went on to become co-founder of the [[Communist Party Opposition|Communist Party of Germany Opposition]], the first national section of the so-called [[International Right Opposition]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\nHeinrich Brandler was born July 3, 1881 to an ethnic [[Austrians|Austrian]] working-class family in [[Varnsdorf]], [[Bohemia]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]].<ref>This region was known in Germany as [[Sudetenland]].</ref> Heinrich's father, Joseph Brandler, was a [[bricklayer]] by trade, and he taught his son the craft from an early age.<ref name=\"Lane\">Klaus Sch\u00f6enhoven, \"Heinrich Brandler,\" in A.

Brandler associated with the left wing of the SPD and was sympathetic to the views of [[Karl Liebknecht]], which often brought him into conflict with more cautious and temperate members of the party and union organizations.<ref name=\"Lazitch\">Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition.'' Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pp. 42-43.</ref>\n\nFrom there, Brandler moved to [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], remaining there from 1908 to 1914.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> While in Switzerland, Brandler worked during the summer building season as a [[stonemason]] and further supplemented his income as a socialist lecturer and teacher.<ref name=\"Lane\" />\n\nBrandler returned to Germany in 1914, just prior to the outbreak of [[World War I]], settling in [[Chemnitz]] as secretary of the building workers' union. Brandler was militant in his opposition to the war, joining the International Group of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]] \u2014 factional activity which ran him afoul of the SPD leadership and ultimately led to his expulsion from the SPD in 1915, along with [[Fritz Heckert]].<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> Brandler was named the delegate of the International Group to the first [[Zimmerwald Conference]] but was stopped by the police at the Swiss border and was unable to attend.<ref name=\"Lazitch\" />\n\nOn January 1, 1916, Brandler was a founding member of the [[Spartacist League]], the formal organization springing from the already-existing International Group.\n\nIn October 1918, Brandler was arrested for illegal political activities and was temporarily deported from Germany, owing to his Austrian citizenship.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> He subsequently obtained German nationality status through [[Gerhard Eisner|Gerhard Eisner's]] government in [[Bavaria]], which allowed his return.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> Brandler was a founding member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) in December of that same year. He was elected to the party's National Committee at the organization's 2nd Congress, held in 1919.<ref name=\"Lazitch\" /> Brandler thus became one of the few members of the [[working class]] itself in the active leadership of the German Communist Party.<ref>E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-1923, Volume 3.'' London: Macmillan, 1953; pg. 170.</ref>\n\nHome in Chemnitz, Brandler established a communist newspaper called ''Der K\u00e4mpfer'' (The Fighter) and helped build a powerful local unit of the KPD.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> He organized workers' councils in Chemnitz immediately after the failure of the ultra-nationalist [[Kapp Putsch]] of 1920.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> On March 15, 1920, Brandler and other Chemnitz communists joined the local social democrats in proclaiming a Soviet government for common defense against the [[nationalism|nationalists]]. This proved to be an ephemeral institution which faded away after a few days when the generals and their government were ousted from [[Berlin]].<ref>Carr, ''The Bolshevik Revolution,'' vol. 3, pg. 173.</ref>\n\nHe was elected to the governing executive body of the KPD in 1920 and reported to the party's Unification Congress on organizational matters later that year.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" />\n\nAided by [[Comintern]] pressure, Brandler's faction took over leadership of the KPD in 1921, with Brandler replacing [[Paul Levi]] as KPD Chairman in February.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> Brandler was leader of the party during the KPD's ill-fated \"[[March Action]]\" of 1921, a role which placed him on a collision course with civil authorities following the failure of the uprising. In June 1921, Brandler was convicted in a [[treason]] trial and sentenced to five years' imprisonment in a fortress. The term was ended abruptly in November of that same year, after which Brandler left for [[Moscow]], where he sat on the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] (ECCI) on behalf of the German party.<ref name=\"Brou\u00e9Bio\" /> Brandler was elected to the ECCI Presidium at its [[1st Enlarged Plenum of ECCI|First Enlarged Plenum]] in February 1922.<ref name=\"Lazitch\" /> Brandler was also active in the affairs of the [[Red International of Labor Unions]] (Profintern) during this interval.<ref name=\"Lane\" />\n\n===Role in the failed 1923 revolution===\n\nBrandler returned to Germany in the August 1922, assuming once again the role of top leader of the German Communist Party,<ref name=\"Lazitch\" /> a position temporarily held by factional ally [[Ernst Meyer (German politician)|Ernst Meyer]]. Brandler, [[August Thalheimer]], and the KPD \"Right\" were soon at odds with the party's left wing, chiefly over the issues of the [[united front]] and the role of the communists in [[coalition government]]s. With respect to the united front, Brandler sought common cause not only with the rank and file but also with the leadership of other workers' parties, while the Left sought to implement a so-called \"united front from below\" by seeking to work with rank and file members in an attempt to turn them against their leaders. With respect to coalition government, Brandler and the Right deemed it permissible for the Communist Party to enter regional coalition governments with the Social Democrats, while the Left declared that any government not dominated by the Communist Party was unworthy of KPD participation.<ref>E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: The Interregnum, 1923-1924.'' London: Macmillan, 1954; pp. 157-158.</ref>\n\nAt the 8th Congress of the KPD, held in Leipzig on January 28, 1923, Brandler and Thalheimer's faction prevailed over the KPD Left, a group led by [[Ernst Thaelmann]], [[Arkadi Maslow]], and [[Ruth Fischer]]. Brandler's faction was the beneficiary of key support from [[Karl Radek]], a top leader of the Communist International.<ref>Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pg. 157.</ref> Brandler's position as head of the KPD was solidified and his tactical interpretation of the united front and coalition \"workers' government\" was affirmed.\n\nThe left wing of the KPD believed that a revolutionary situation existed in Germany in 1923 and anxiously pushed for the setting of a date for a general uprising on the Russian [[Bolshevik]] model. While giving support to this general idea in the party's councils, in private Brandler seems to have felt that Germany was no yet ripe for a revolution and he sought additional time to win a greater percentage of the German working class to the idea. In September 1923, Brandler returned to Moscow for consultations.<ref name=\"Lazitch\" /> At a secret meeting of the [[Politburo]] of the Russian Communist Party it was decided, at the insistence of [[Leon Trotsky]], to set November 7, 1923 \u2014 the sixth anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution \u2014 as the date for the German uprising.<ref>Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pp. 204-205.</ref> Brandler refused to accept the setting of this artificial future date, however, winning agreement that the final date of the uprising should be left to the German Communists themselves.<ref name=\"Carr4-206\">Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pg. 206.</ref>\n\nBrandler returned to Germany with plans for revolution in the offing. In [[Saxony]] the Social Democrats governed thanks to supporting votes by Communist delegates in the Landtag. It was understood that the Communists could claim a share of the ministerial portfolios if they so desired. Following Brandler's return, the Communist Party decided to exercise this option, doing the same in [[Thuringia]], where a similar situation existed. It was hoped that the Communists' place in the government would prove useful in course the forthcoming armed uprising.<ref name=\"Carr4-206\" /> Negotiations began for entry of the Communists into the government. Brandler remained reluctant to set the final date for the revolution, however, arguing that the time was still not ripe and that the masses remained to be mobilized.<ref>Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pg. 207.</ref>\n\nOn October 1, 1923, a [[telegram]] signed by Comintern President [[Grigory Zinoviev]] on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Comintern was dispatched to the national committee of the German Communist Party declaring that by its estimate \"the decisive moment will come in four, five, six weeks.\" The Communists were directed to \"carry out at once the arming of 50,000 to 60,000 men.\"<ref>Cited in Carr, ''The Intrregnum,'' pp. 207-208.</ref> This proved to be a fanciful estimate, however, as the party possessed no more than 11,000 rifles and the bulk of its armed forces were far away from [[Saxony]], where the proposed uprising was to be centered.<ref>Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pg. 211.</ref>\n\nExacerbating their weak numbers in terms of men and material, the Communists faced a substantial contingent of [[Reichswehr]], with superior training and armaments, as well as illegal right wing militias.<ref>Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pg. 212.</ref> The number of purported sympathizers among the regular officers corps was greatly exaggerated, as was the degree of support for the Communist project among the working class itself.<ref>Carr, ''The Interregnum,'' pp. 212-213.</ref>\n\nIn 1923, Brandler was responsible for calling off a planned revolutionary uprising following the defection of left-wing Social Democrats from the revolutionary group. An [[Hamburg uprising|ill-fated uprising]] continued in Hamburg, conducted when workers were not properly informed of the cancellation of the revolt. Brandler and his close associate [[August Thalheimer]] were largely blamed for this debacle by the [[Comintern]] and his career as leader of the German Communist movement was effectively ended. He was recalled to the [[Soviet Union]] by the Comintern in January 1924, and he remained that country for the best part of the next four years.<ref name=\"Lazitch\" /> \n\nThe disgraced Brandler was sent on a party task to [[Kazakhstan]] in [[Soviet Central Asia]], where he remained until being partially restored to the Comintern's good graces sometime in 1926.<ref name=\"Lane\" /> This respite proved to be short-lived. Brandler and his associates were harsh critics of new German Communist Party leader [[Ernst Thaelmann]], an individual stoutly supported by the ever more powerful Russian Communist Party leadership.<ref>Robert J. Alexander, ''The Right Opposition: The Lovestoneites and the International Communist Opposition of the 1930s.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1981; pg. 135.</ref> Brandler again became the object of harsh criticism for factional activity at the [[7th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI]] in the winter of 1926, ending with a specific prohibition of his continuing further work in the German Communist Party.<ref name=\"Lazitch\" />\n\n[[File:Brandler-pub.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cover of ''Gegen den Strom,'' official publication of the \"Brandlerite\" Communist Party of Germany (Opposition).]]\n\n===Expulsion and communist oppositional activities===\n\nIn the fall of 1928 an event ([[Wittorf affair]]) took place in the Communist Party of Germany which ultimately led to the final break of Brandler and Thalheimer and their supporters. The secretary of the Hamburg organization of the KPD was found to have embezzled 2,000 marks from the party treasury for his own use. When accountants from national party headquarters discovered the crime, they had been threatened with expulsion from the party by party leader Thaelmann if they exposed the theft. The Comintern got wind of the scandal which led to a crisis in the German party with the Central Committee acting to remove Thaelmann, with Thaelmann joining in the unanimous vote.<ref name=\"Alexander136\">Alexander, ''The Right Opposition,'' pg. 136.</ref>\n\nThis presented a threat to the faction of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by [[Joseph Stalin]], who saw in Thaelmann a reliable ally during a time of bitter factional warfare. As a result, the Presidium of the Comintern countermanded the German Central Committee's action, restoring Thaelmann as secretary.<ref name=\"Alexander136\" />\n\nIn October 1928 Brandler returned to Germany against the KPD's wishes. The corruption of Thaelmann's Hamburg organization and its protection by the Stalin faction in Moscow was used as a pretext for Brandler and Thalheimer to issue a call for a meeting of their followers on November 11, 1928.<ref>The gathering was to be held on December 30, 1928.</ref> \n\nThe Comintern, predictably, reacted with fury. Brandler, Thalheimer, and their associates were bitterly criticized in an open letter from the Comintern on December 19, 1928.

It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to June 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when U.S. Senator from Vermont [[Bernie Sanders]], his last major primary opponent, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nIf Biden and Trump are both on the ballot in November, they will respectively be the oldest and second oldest major party nominees in U.S. history,{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]], whereas on Election Day in 2020 Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74.}} and Biden, if elected and inaugurated in 2021, would immediately upon assuming office be the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021 Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.<ref name=\"JAb2o\" /><ref name=\"t9U5e\" /> On March 12, President Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.<ref name=\"NM4Ve\" /> The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the [[CNN]] studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"iUhTN\" /> Several states have also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,<ref name=\"2rHUH\" /> Kentucky,<ref name=\"BOyPg\" /> Louisiana,<ref name=\"9Jz7W\" /> Ohio,<ref name=\"YrwnH\" /> and Maryland.<ref name=\"slHNd\" /> As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates have halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over coronavirus concerns. Political analysts have stated that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled to the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.<ref name=\"sXzhh\" /><ref name=\"u1jgH\" /><ref name=\"w7xk5\" />\n\nThe [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] included money for states to increase mail-in voting.<ref name=\"NQGai\" />\n\nGovernment response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled to the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act|economic stimulus]] remains a major campaign issue for both parties.<ref name=\"kLGv5\" /><ref name=\"jAPgE\" />\n\n==Nominations==\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{main|2020 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n====Primaries====\nIn election cycles with incumbent presidents running for re-election, the race for their party nomination are usually ''pro-forma'', with token opposition instead of any serious challengers and with their party rules being fixed in their favor.<ref name=\"B1TfP\" /><ref name=\"politico20190506\" /> The 2020 election is no exception; with Donald Trump formally seeking a second term,<ref name=\"DFAz3\" /><ref name=\"VkToz\" /> the official Republican apparatus, both state and national, have coordinated with his campaign to implement changes to make it difficult for any primary opponent to mount a serious challenge.<ref name=\"ct7mA\" /><ref name=\"Rbspl\" /> On January 25, 2019, the [[Republican National Committee]] unofficially endorsed Trump.<ref name=\"u5OTG\" />\n\nSeveral Republican state committees have scrapped their respective primaries or caucuses.<ref name=\"politico20190906\" /> They have cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, is considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization conflict with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media.

This would require a candidate to win a majority of pledged delegates from the assorted primary elections in order to win the party's nomination. The last time this did not occur was the nomination of [[Adlai Stevenson II]] at the [[1952 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name=\"ssKcA\" /> Meanwhile, six states will use [[Ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] in the primaries: Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, and Wyoming for all voters; and Iowa and Nevada for absentee voters.<ref name=\"7VCs8\" />\n\nAfter [[Hillary Clinton]]'s loss in the [[2016 United States presidential election|previous]] election, the Democratic Party was seen largely as leaderless<ref name=\"BGA13\" /> and fractured between the [[centrist]] Clinton wing and the more [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[Bernie Sanders|Sanders]] wing of the party, echoing the rift brought up in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 primary]] election.<ref name=\"YGlMQ\" /><ref name=\"le0En\" />\n\nThis divide between the establishment and progressive wings of the party has been reflected in several elections leading up to the 2020 primaries, most notably in 2017 with the election for [[Democratic National Committee chairmanship election, 2017|DNC chair]] between moderate-backed [[Tom Perez]] and progressive-backed [[Keith Ellison]]:<ref name=\"rrgRf\" /> Perez was elected chairman, and Ellison was appointed the [[Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee|deputy chair]], a largely ceremonial role. In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates. [[Pete Buttigieg]] narrowly defeated [[Bernie Sanders]] in Iowa, then Sanders edged Buttigieg in the February 11 [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Following [[Michael Bennet]], [[Deval Patrick]], and [[Andrew Yang]] dropping out, Sanders won the [[2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses|Nevada caucuses]] on February 22. [[Joe Biden]] then won the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary|South Carolina primary]], causing Buttigieg, [[Amy Klobuchar]], and [[Tom Steyer]] to abandon their campaigns (Buttigieg and Klobuchar then immediately endorsed Biden). After [[Super Tuesday]], March 3, [[Michael Bloomberg]] and [[Elizabeth Warren]] quit the race, leaving three candidates left: Biden and Sanders, the main contenders, and [[Tulsi Gabbard]], who remained in the race despite facing nigh-on insurmountable odds.<ref name=\"cw3Ne\" /> Gabbard then dropped out and endorsed Biden after the March 17 [[2020 Arizona Democratic primary|Arizona]], [[2020 Florida Democratic primary|Florida]], and [[2020 Illinois Democratic primary|Illinois]] races.<ref name=\"2vZj6\" /> On April 8, 2020, Sanders dropped out, leaving Biden as the only major

It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to June 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when U.S. Senator from Vermont [[Bernie Sanders]], his last major primary opponent, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nIf Biden and Trump are both on the ballot in November, they will respectively be the oldest and second oldest major party nominees in U.S. history,{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]], whereas on Election Day in 2020 Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74.}} and Biden, if elected and inaugurated in 2021, would immediately upon assuming office be the oldest serving President.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021 Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.<ref name=\"JAb2o\" /><ref name=\"t9U5e\" /> On March 12, President Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.<ref name=\"NM4Ve\" /> The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the [[CNN]] studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"iUhTN\" /> Several states have also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,<ref name=\"2rHUH\" /> Kentucky,<ref name=\"BOyPg\" /> Louisiana,<ref name=\"9Jz7W\" /> Ohio,<ref name=\"YrwnH\" /> and Maryland.<ref name=\"slHNd\" /> As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates have halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over coronavirus concerns. Political analysts have stated that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled to the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.<ref name=\"sXzhh\" /><ref name=\"u1jgH\" /><ref name=\"w7xk5\" />\n\nThe [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] included money for states to increase mail-in voting.<ref name=\"NQGai\" />\n\nGovernment response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled to the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act|economic stimulus]] remains a major campaign issue for both parties.<ref name=\"kLGv5\" /><ref name=\"jAPgE\" />\n\n==Nominations==\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{main|2020 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n====Primaries====\nIn election cycles with incumbent presidents running for re-election, the race for their party nomination are usually ''pro-forma'', with token opposition instead of any serious challengers and with their party rules being fixed in their favor.<ref name=\"B1TfP\" /><ref name=\"politico20190506\" /> The 2020 election is no exception; with Donald Trump formally seeking a second term,<ref name=\"DFAz3\" /><ref name=\"VkToz\" /> the official Republican apparatus, both state and national, have coordinated with his campaign to implement changes to make it difficult for any primary opponent to mount a serious challenge.<ref name=\"ct7mA\" /><ref name=\"Rbspl\" /> On January 25, 2019, the [[Republican National Committee]] unofficially endorsed Trump.<ref name=\"u5OTG\" />\n\nSeveral Republican state committees have scrapped their respective primaries or caucuses.<ref name=\"politico20190906\" /> They have cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, is considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization conflict with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media.

This would require a candidate to win a majority of pledged delegates from the assorted primary elections in order to win the party's nomination. The last time this did not occur was the nomination of [[Adlai Stevenson II]] at the [[1952 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name=\"ssKcA\" /> Meanwhile, six states will use [[Ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] in the primaries: Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, and Wyoming for all voters; and Iowa and Nevada for absentee voters.<ref name=\"7VCs8\" />\n\nAfter [[Hillary Clinton]]'s loss in the [[2016 United States presidential election|previous]] election, the Democratic Party was seen largely as leaderless<ref name=\"BGA13\" /> and fractured between the [[centrist]] Clinton wing and the more [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[Bernie Sanders|Sanders]] wing of the party, echoing the rift brought up in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 primary]] election.<ref name=\"YGlMQ\" /><ref name=\"le0En\" />\n\nThis divide between the establishment and progressive wings of the party has been reflected in several elections leading up to the 2020 primaries, most notably in 2017 with the election for [[Democratic National Committee chairmanship election, 2017|DNC chair]] between moderate-backed [[Tom Perez]] and progressive-backed [[Keith Ellison]]:<ref name=\"rrgRf\" /> Perez was elected chairman, and Ellison was appointed the [[Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee|deputy chair]], a largely ceremonial role. In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates. [[Pete Buttigieg]] narrowly defeated [[Bernie Sanders]] in Iowa, then Sanders edged Buttigieg in the February 11 [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Following [[Michael Bennet]], [[Deval Patrick]], and [[Andrew Yang]] dropping out, Sanders won the [[2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses|Nevada caucuses]] on February 22. [[Joe Biden]] then won the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary|South Carolina primary]], causing Buttigieg, [[Amy Klobuchar]], and [[Tom Steyer]] to abandon their campaigns (Buttigieg and Klobuchar then immediately endorsed Biden). After [[Super Tuesday]], March 3, [[Michael Bloomberg]] and [[Elizabeth Warren]] quit the race, leaving three candidates left: Biden and Sanders, the main contenders, and [[Tulsi Gabbard]], who remained in the race despite facing nigh-on insurmountable odds.<ref name=\"cw3Ne\" /> Gabbard then dropped out and endorsed Biden after the March 17 [[2020 Arizona Democratic primary|Arizona]], [[2020 Florida Democratic primary|Florida]], and [[2020 Illinois Democratic primary|Illinois]] races.<ref name=\"2vZj6\" /> On April 8, 2020, Sanders dropped out, leaving Biden as the only major

As a child, he received a traditional ''[[cheder]]'' education.\n\nIn the 1930s, Bronshtein lived in [[Bucharest]], where he debuted with poetry and critical essays in the Yiddish-language literary periodicals of Romania. Among other magazines, he published in ''Di Vokh'' (\"The Week\"), edited by prose writer [[Moyshe Altman]], and in ''Shoybn'' (\"Windows\"), edited by the poet and theatrical director [[Jacob Sternberg|Yankev Shternberg]]. Shternberg organized a circle of Yiddish literati, predominantly from Bessarabia, which in addition to Srul Bronshtein included poets [[Tzvi Tzelman]], [[Zishe Bagish]] and prose writers [[Ikhil Shraybman]], [[Arn Ocnitzer]], Azriel Roitman, among others.\n\nIt was in Bucharest that Bronshtein's first collection of Yiddish verse was published in 1938, entitled ''Moldove, mayn heym'' (\"[[Moldavia]], my home\").<ref>[http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/fishstein/search/fullrecord.php?id=170 Search record] in Joe Fishstein Collection of Yiddish Poetry, Division of Rare Books and Special Collections, McLennan Library, [[McGill University]]. Accessed online 4 December 2006.</ref> It was followed by the second collection ''Kh'ob geefnt breyt di toyern'' (\"I've opened wide the gates\") a year later.
