This company changed its name in the following years to '''Mitsukawa Shokai''' and then to '''Mitsubishi Shokai'''.

During this time, Iwasaki became close to [[Sakamoto Ry\u014dma]], a major figure in the [[Meiji Restoration]] that ended the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and restored the primacy of the [[emperor of Japan]] in 1867. Iwasaki was placed in charge of the Tosa clan's trading operation, '''Tsukumo Shokai''', based in [[Osaka]]. This company changed its name in the following years to '''Mitsukawa Shokai''' and then to '''Mitsubishi Shokai'''. Around 1871, the company was renamed '''Mitsubishi Steamship Company''' and began a mail service between Yokohama and Shanghai with government sponsorship.<ref name=\"iwasaki\">{{cite web|title=Timeline of the Life & Times of Yataro Iwasaki|url=http://www.mitsubishicorp.com/jp/en/mclibrary/roots/vol03/|website=Mitsubishi Corporation|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nUnder Iwasaki's leadership in the late 1800s, Mitsubishi diversified its business into insurance ([[Tokio Marine Insurance Company]] and [[Meiji Life Insurance Company]]), mining (Takashima Coal Mine) and shipbuilding.<ref name=\"iwasaki\" /> Following his death in 1885, his successor [[Yanosuke Iwasaki]] merged the shipping operation with a rival enterprise to form the [[Nippon Yusen Kaisha]] (NYK) and refocused Mitsubishi's business on coal and copper mining.

He was drafted in the 10th round, 200th overall in the [[1990 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[New Jersey Devils]]. Schwab won the 2003 [[Stanley Cup]] with the New Jersey Devils and the 1995 [[Calder Cup]] with the [[Albany River Rats]]. THE PROUD FATHER OF THE BRADY SCHWAB A.K.A. BRADY BAE OF PINNACLE HIGH SCHOOL.\n\n==Playing career==\nFollowing a three-year [[Western Hockey League|WHL]] career in [[Seattle]], Schwab saw time with the [[ECHL]]'s [[Cincinnati Cyclones]] and the AHL's [[Utica Devils]] before settling in with the AHL's Albany River Rats for two seasons. During the 1994-95 season, Schwab was joined by fellow 1990 draftee [[Mike Dunham]] between the pipes. While Schwab led the league in goals against average with 2.59, the two combined for the AHL's fewest goals against and were awarded the Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Trophy as well as the [[Jack A. Butterfield Trophy]] as the playoff MVP's helping the River Rats capture their first Calder Cup title.\n\nThe next season, Schwab saw his first action in the NHL when he was called up to New Jersey where he appeared in ten games. At the end of the season, he was traded to the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], where he stayed for three seasons. He then went out West to the [[Vancouver Canucks]] for another brief stay and spent time that year with the AHL's [[Syracuse Crunch]] and IHL's [[Orlando Solar Bears (IHL)|Orlando Solar Bears]] before moving on to play with the IHL's [[Kansas City Blades]] in 2000-01.\n\nSchwab began the 2001-02 season at the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]' training camp without a contract. After an impressive pre-season, he was signed to the team as the backup goaltender for [[Curtis Joseph]]. Schwab started 30 games for the Leafs and had a career high 12 wins before signing as a free agent in the off-season with the team that originally drafted him back in 1990, the New Jersey Devils.\n\nThe return to New Jersey was very timely for Schwab, as the Devils claimed the Stanley Cup in 2003 - the franchise's third title in nine years and Schwab's first as a player.\n\nSchwab's final game was played on January 17, 2004 where he posted a 2\u20131 overtime victory over the [[Washington Capitals]]. Schwab finished his career having played in 147 regular season NHL games amassing 43 wins, 63 losses and 13 ties with a goals against average of 2.89, a save percentage of .896, and 6 shutouts. Schwab appeared in 40 minutes of postseason action over 3 games with the Maple Leafs and Devils stopping all 13 shots he faced.\n\nHe served as goaltending development coach and scout for three seasons (2005\u201308) with the Tampa Bay Lightning. He was the goaltending development coach for the [[San Jose Sharks]] (2008-2015).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.mercurynews.com/sharks/2015/09/12/sharks-name-evgeni-nabakov-goaltender-development-coach-special-assignment-scout/|title = Sharks name Evgeni Nabakov goaltender development coach, special assignment scout - Working the Corners|website = Working the Corners|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-03-09}}</ref> He is currently the goaltending coach for the Arizona Coyotes.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Regular season and playoffs===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:75%\"\n|- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |  \n! align=\"center\" rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |  \n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | [[Regular season]]\n! align=\"center\" rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |  \n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | [[Playoffs]]\n|- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!

Schwab started 30 games for the Leafs and had a career high 12 wins before signing as a free agent in the off-season with the team that originally drafted him back in 1990, the New Jersey Devils.\n\nThe return to New Jersey was very timely for Schwab, as the Devils claimed the Stanley Cup in 2003 - the franchise's third title in nine years and Schwab's first as a player.\n\nSchwab's final game was played on January 17, 2004 where he posted a 2\u20131 overtime victory over the [[Washington Capitals]]. Schwab finished his career having played in 147 regular season NHL games amassing 43 wins, 63 losses and 13 ties with a goals against average of 2.89, a save percentage of .896, and 6 shutouts. Schwab appeared in 40 minutes of postseason action over 3 games with the Maple Leafs and Devils stopping all 13 shots he faced.\n\nHe served as goaltending development coach and scout for three seasons (2005\u201308) with the Tampa Bay Lightning. He was the goaltending development coach for the [[San Jose Sharks]] (2008-2015).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.mercurynews.com/sharks/2015/09/12/sharks-name-evgeni-nabakov-goaltender-development-coach-special-assignment-scout/|title = Sharks name Evgeni Nabakov goaltender development coach, special assignment scout - Working the Corners|website = Working the Corners|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-03-09}}</ref> He is currently the goaltending coach for the Arizona Coyotes.\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Regular season and playoffs===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:75%\"\n|- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |  \n! align=\"center\" rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |  \n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | [[Regular season]]\n! align=\"center\" rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |  \n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | [[Playoffs]]\n|- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!

J., & de Vries, K. (2008). ''D7.14a: Where idem-identity meets ipse-identity: Conceptual explorations''. Brussel: FIDIS.http://www.fidis.net/fileadmin/fidis/deliverables/fidis-WP7-del7.14a-idem_meets_ipse_conceptual_explorations.pdf, accessed 2019-12-09</ref>\n\n# Idem-identity: A third-person (i.e., objectified) attribution of sameness. Such an objectified perspective can not only be taken towards others but also towards oneself.\n# Ipse-identity: The ipse-identity perspective is the first-person perspective on what constitutes oneself as a continuous being (idem) in the course of time, while experiencing multiplicity and difference in the here and now.\n# me-identity: The \u2018me\u2019 (G. H. Mead) is the organised set of attitudes of others which one assumes. It is coconstituted by the \u2018I\u2019, the first person perspective, which incorporates the variety of third person perspectives it encounters and develops. Thus, the \u2018me\u2019 is continuously reconstituted in the face of changing third person perspectives on the self.\n\nIn Bertino's and Takahashi's textbook,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Identity Management : concepts, technologies, and systems|last=Bertino, Elisa.|date=2010|publisher=Artech House|others=Takahashi, Kenji.|isbn=978-1-60807-039-8|location=Boston, MA|oclc=700220032}}</ref> three categories of identity are defined that are to a degree overlapping with the FIDIS identity concepts:\n\n* \u201dMe-Identity\u201d: What I define as identity\n* \u201dOur-Identity\u201d: What others and I define as identity\n* \u201dTheir-Identity\u201d: What others define as my identity\n\n=== Purposes for using identity management systems ===\nIdentity management systems are concerned with the creation, the adminstration and the deployment of:\n\n* Identifiers: Data used to identify a subject.\n* Credentials: Data providing evidence for claims about identities or parts thereof.\n* Attributes: Data describing characteristics of a subject.\n\nThe purposes of identity management systems are:\n\n* Identification: Who is the user \u2013 used on logon or database lookup\n* Authentication: Is this the real user? Systems needs to provide evidence!\n* Authorization and non-repudiation: Authorization of documents or transaction with e-ID and most often with digital signature based on e-ID. Generates non-repudiation and receipts.\n\n=== Commercial solutions ===\nIdentity-management systems, products, applications, and platforms are commercial Identity-management solutions implemented for enterprises and organizations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iverified.org/|title=FREE Verification App for 4.2 Billion Online Users}}</ref>\n \nTechnologies, services, and terms related to identity management include [[Active directory|active directories]], [[service provider]]s, [[identity provider]]s, [[Web service]]s, [[access control]], [[Digital identity|digital identities]], [[password manager]]s, [[single sign-on]], [[security token]]s, [[security token service]]s (STS), [[Workflow application|workflows]], [[OpenID]], [[WS-Security]], [[WS-Trust]], [[SAML 2.0]], [[OAuth]], and [[RBAC]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/aa570351| title=Identity management security}}</ref>\n\n== Electronic identity management ==\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn general, electronic IdM can be said to cover the management of any form of digital identities.  \nThe focus on [[identity management]] goes back to the development of directories, such as [[X.500]], where a [[namespace]] serves to hold [[named objects]] that represent real-life \"identified\" entities, such as countries, organizations, applications, subscribers or devices. The [[X.509]] [[ITU-T]] standard defined certificates carried identity attributes as two directory names: the certificate subject and the certificate issuer. X.509 certificates and [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]] systems operate to prove the online \"identity\" of a subject. Therefore, in IT terms, one can consider identity management as the management of information (as held in a directory) that represents items identified in real life (e.g. users, organizations, devices, services, etc.).

Brussel: FIDIS.http://www.fidis.net/fileadmin/fidis/deliverables/fidis-WP7-del7.14a-idem_meets_ipse_conceptual_explorations.pdf, accessed 2019-12-09</ref>\n\n# Idem-identity: A third-person (i.e., objectified) attribution of sameness. Such an objectified perspective can not only be taken towards others but also towards oneself.\n# Ipse-identity: The ipse-identity perspective is the first-person perspective on what constitutes oneself as a continuous being (idem) in the course of time, while experiencing multiplicity and difference in the here and now.\n# me-identity: The \u2018me\u2019 (G. H. Mead) is the organised set of attitudes of others which one assumes. It is coconstituted by the \u2018I\u2019, the first person perspective, which incorporates the variety of third person perspectives it encounters and develops. Thus, the \u2018me\u2019 is continuously reconstituted in the face of changing third person perspectives on the self.\n\nIn Bertino's and Takahashi's textbook,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Identity Management : concepts, technologies, and systems|last=Bertino, Elisa.|date=2010|publisher=Artech House|others=Takahashi, Kenji.|isbn=978-1-60807-039-8|location=Boston, MA|oclc=700220032}}</ref> three categories of identity are defined that are to a degree overlapping with the FIDIS identity concepts:\n\n* \u201dMe-Identity\u201d: What I define as identity\n* \u201dOur-Identity\u201d: What others and I define as identity\n* \u201dTheir-Identity\u201d: What others define as my identity\n\n=== Purposes for using identity management systems ===\nIdentity management systems are concerned with the creation, the adminstration and the deployment of:\n\n* Identifiers: Data used to identify a subject.\n* Credentials: Data providing evidence for claims about identities or parts thereof.\n* Attributes: Data describing characteristics of a subject.\n\nThe purposes of identity management systems are:\n\n* Identification: Who is the user \u2013 used on logon or database lookup\n* Authentication: Is this the real user? Systems needs to provide evidence!\n* Authorization and non-repudiation: Authorization of documents or transaction with e-ID and most often with digital signature based on e-ID. Generates non-repudiation and receipts.\n\n=== Commercial solutions ===\nIdentity-management systems, products, applications, and platforms are commercial Identity-management solutions implemented for enterprises and organizations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iverified.org/|title=FREE Verification App for 4.2 Billion Online Users}}</ref>\n \nTechnologies, services, and terms related to identity management include [[Active directory|active directories]], [[service provider]]s, [[identity provider]]s, [[Web service]]s, [[access control]], [[Digital identity|digital identities]], [[password manager]]s, [[single sign-on]], [[security token]]s, [[security token service]]s (STS), [[Workflow application|workflows]], [[OpenID]], [[WS-Security]], [[WS-Trust]], [[SAML 2.0]], [[OAuth]], and [[RBAC]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/aa570351| title=Identity management security}}</ref>\n\n== Electronic identity management ==\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn general, electronic IdM can be said to cover the management of any form of digital identities.  \nThe focus on [[identity management]] goes back to the development of directories, such as [[X.500]], where a [[namespace]] serves to hold [[named objects]] that represent real-life \"identified\" entities, such as countries, organizations, applications, subscribers or devices. The [[X.509]] [[ITU-T]] standard defined certificates carried identity attributes as two directory names: the certificate subject and the certificate issuer. X.509 certificates and [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]] systems operate to prove the online \"identity\" of a subject. Therefore, in IT terms, one can consider identity management as the management of information (as held in a directory) that represents items identified in real life (e.g. users, organizations, devices, services, etc.). The design of such systems requires explicit information and identity engineering tasks.\n\nThe evolution of identity management follows the progression of [[Internet]] technology closely. In the environment of static web pages and static portals of the early 1990s, corporations investigated the delivery of informative web content such as the \"white pages\" of employees. Subsequently, as the information changed (due to employee turnover, provisioning and de-provisioning), the ability to perform self-service and help-desk updates more efficiently morphed into what became known as Identity Management {{As of|2008|alt= today}}.\n\nTypical identity management functionality includes the following:\n\n* [[Access control]]\n* [[Cloud computing]]\n* [[Digital identity]] management\n* [[Password manager]]\n* [[Workflow automation]]\n* [[Provisioning]]\n* [[Single sign-on]]\n* [[Security Token Service]]\n* [[Role based access control]]\n* [[Risk management]]\n\nIdentity management also addresses the age-old [['N+1' problem]] \u2014 where every new application may entail the setting up of new data stores of users. The ability to centrally manage the provisioning and de-provisioning of identities, and consolidate the proliferation of identity stores, all form part of the identity-management process.\n\n== Solutions ==\n\n[[solution marketing|Solutions]] which fall under the category of identity management may include:\n\n'''Management of identities'''\n* [[Provisioning]]/De-provisioning of accounts\n* [[Workflow automation]]\n* [[Delegated administration]]\n* [[Password synchronization]]\n* [[Self-service password reset]]\n\n'''Access control'''\n* [[Password manager]]\n* [[Single sign-on]] (SSO)\n* Web single sign-on (Web SSO)\n* [[Role-based access control]] (RBAC)\n* [[Attribute-based access control|Attribute based access control]] (ABAC)\n\n'''Directory services'''\n* [[x.500]] and [[LDAP]]\n* [[Active Directory|Microsoft Active Directory]]\n* [[NetIQ eDirectory]]\n* Identity repository (directory services for the administration of user account attributes)\n* [[Metadata]] replication/Synchronization\n* Directory virtualization ([[Virtual directory]])\n* [[e-Business]] scale directory systems\n* Next-generation systems - [[Composite Adaptive Directory Services]] (CADS) and CADS SDP\n\n'''Other categories'''\n* [[Federated identity|Federation]] of user access rights on web applications across otherwise untrusted networks\n* [[Directory-enabled networking]] and [[802.1x|802.1X EAP]]\n\n== Standards ==\n* [[SAML 2.0]]\n* [[OAuth]]\n* [[OpenID]]\n* [[Liberty Alliance]] &mdash; A consortium promoting federated identity management\n* [[Shibboleth (Internet2)]] &mdash; Identity standards targeted towards educational environments\n* Global Trust Center\n* [[Central Authentication Service]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Light-Weight Identity]] (LID)\n* [[Metadirectory]] and [[Virtual directory]]\n* [[Network Information Service]] (NIS)\n* [[Privacy enhancing technologies]] (PET)\n* [[User profile]]\n* [[Windows CardSpace]]\n* [[XML Enabled Directory]]\n* [[Yadis]]\n* [[Identity verification service]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Identity management]]\n[[Category:Identity management systems| ]]\n", "name_user": "PabloStraub", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eModes of identity management", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity-management_system"}

These ratings by BARB, the official ratings agency, average out BBC Three's viewing figures over a 24-hour period even though the channel only broadcasts in the evening, giving a distorted sense of the channel's viewership. Despite several official complaints from the BBC, BARB continued to publish figures which the BBC argues are unrepresentative.{{when|date=May 2019}}{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nBBC Three's programming consisted of comedy, drama, spin-off series and repeated episodes of series from BBC One and BBC Two, and other programmes that attempted to alert others of their actions through a series of programmes challenging common beliefs.\n\nAn example of BBC Three's comedy output includes the award-winning comedy ''[[Little Britain]]'', which in October 2004 broke its previous viewing record when 1.8 million viewers tuned in for a new series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/225419/BBC-Three-last-laugh-Little-Britains-2m-ratings/?HAYILC=RELATED |title=BBC Three has last laugh with Little Britain's 2m ratings |last=Matthews |first=Sam |date=20 October 2004 |work=Brand Republic |accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref> ''Little Britain'' was later broadcast on the BBC's terrestrial analogue channels BBC One and BBC Two. The channels longest-running comedy programme is ''[[Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps]]''. Some current programmes feature stand-up comedians performing their own take on a subject, usually the news, examples of which include ''[[Russell Howard's Good News]]'' (which later transferred to [[BBC Two]], partly due to its success, and partly to BBC Three's move to online only) and ''[[Lee Nelson's Well Good Show]]''.\n\n===Comedy and drama===\nThe channel aired various comedies and dramas; one of its most popular sitcoms was ''[[Gavin & Stacey]]'', which first aired in May 2007 and was written by and starring [[James Corden]] and [[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]] alongside [[Mathew Horne]], [[Joanna Page]], [[Alison Steadman]] and [[Rob Brydon]]. The sitcom was an instant hit, with subsequent series being moved to other BBC channels and the show being granted a Christmas special. Another example is ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]'', a drama in which a ghost, a [[vampire]] and a [[werewolf]] share a flat, which has become a success and heralded several new series. American programming also features, with ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'' being the notable examples.\n\nNumerous popular series were either repeated on the channel or have spin-offs created from them. In early 2003, viewers could watch episodes of popular BBC soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' on BBC Three before they were broadcast on BBC One. This programming decision coincided with the relaunch of the channel and helped it break the one million viewers milestone for the first time. An episode of ''EastEnders Revealed'', which was commissioned for BBC Three and looking behind the scenes of the programme, attracted 611,000 viewers. In 2005, BBC Three commissioned the documentary series ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'', which was shown immediately after episodes of the new series of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' had been screened on BBC One. This was followed up in July 2005, when it began to screen repeats of both programmes.\n\nIn October 2005, it was announced that BBC Three had commissioned a spin-off drama series from ''Doctor Who'', ''[[Torchwood]]'', designed as a post-[[watershed (television)|watershed]] science fiction drama for a more adult audience. ''Torchwood'' launched with 2.4 million viewers in October 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=Torchwood scores record audience |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6077078.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=23 October 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2008}}</ref> ''Torchwood'' is the first science fiction programme ever to have been commissioned by the channel, and its popularity led to it being broadcast on BBC Two for the second series, and on BBC One for subsequent series. In 2010, BBC Three began airing episodes of the fifth series of BBC drama series ''[[Waterloo Road (TV series)|Waterloo Road]]'' after they had aired on BBC One as part of its 'catch-up' programming. From January 2015, BBC Three aired the remaining episodes of ''Waterloo Road'' before being repeated on BBC One later the same day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s24/waterloo-road/news/a615903/waterloo-road-to-lose-primetime-bbc-one-slot.html |title=Waterloo Road to lose primetime BBC One slot |work=Digital Spy |date=11 December 2014 |accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nAmong its original programming, the channel also gave viewers the [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Pramface]]'', which was written by Chris Reddy and comprised 19 episodes over three series, broadcast between 2012 and 2014.\n\n===Documentaries===\nBBC Three also airs highly acclaimed documentaries reflecting young people's experience of the world, including the [[Bafta]] winning ''Our War'', ''[[Blood, Sweat and T-shirts]]'' (as well as subsequent sequels), ''Life & Death Row'' and their recent{{when?|date=March 2020}} season of films about mental illness. BBC Three also broadcasts specialist factual documentaries, such as ''How Drugs Work'' and ''How Sex Works.''\n\n[[Stacey Dooley]], since her appearance on ''[[Blood, Sweat and T-shirts]]'' in 2008, has been presenting documentaries including: ''Stacey Dooley in the USA (2012-2014), Coming Here Soon (2012), The Natives: This is our America (2017), Beaten by my Boyfriend (2015), Stacey Dooley in Cologne: The Blame Game (2016), Sex in Strange Places (2016)'', ''Stacey Dooley: Hate and Pride in Orlando (2016)'', ''Stacey Dooley on the Frontline: Girls, Guns and Isis (2016)'', ''Brainwashing Stacey'' (2016), ''Stacey Dooley: Face to Face with Isis (2018)'', and countless more titles under the umbrella title ''Stacey Dooley Investigates (2009-present)''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/search?q=stacey+dooley|title=BBC - Search results for stacey dooley|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4099152/|title=Stacey Dooley|website=IMDb|access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nBBC Three has also commissioned a number of notable single one-off documentaries, including ''Growing Up Down's'' (2014), ''[[My Brother the Islamist]]'' (2011), ''Small Teen Big World'' (2010); ''Stormchaser: The Butterfly and the Tornado'' (2012) and ''The Autistic Me'' (2009).

They are presented in a relaxed style in keeping with the rest of the channel. As part of the BBC's discussions with the government regarding the founding of the channel, a longer news programme had been promised to provide a daily section of news and current affairs. ''The News Show'', as it came to be called upon launch, was later rebranded ''[[The 7 O'Clock News]]''. However, the BBC discontinued the bulletin in 2005, following a recommendation made in the 2004 Barwise Report, which found that the channel's target audience sought news from elsewhere.<ref>{{cite news |date=21 October 2005 |title=BBC Three drops nightly news show |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4365628.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe channel also showed some sports programming.

The idea used by both Lambie-Nairn, who had developed the branding for [[CBeebies]] and [[CBBC]], and Aardman, was to create the BBC Three blobs as a relation to the green and yellow blobs of the children's channels. Kieron Elliott, Lola Buckley, Gavin Inskip and Jen Long provided out-of-vision continuity.\n\nOn 22 January 2008 a new channel identity was unveiled. Rebranding was carried out by [[Red Bee Media]], along with agencies MPG and Agency Republic with music and sound design by creative audio company Koink.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koink.uk.com|title=Home \u2013 Creative Production \u2013 Original Music \u2013 Koink|accessdate=11 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Discovery idents were introduced in October 2013 and lasted until January 2016, retaining the logo from 2008.

Their plan was for [[BBC Knowledge]] to be replaced with [[BBC Four]]\u2014which took place in 2002\u2014and for [[BBC Choice]] to be replaced with BBC Three. However, questions were raised over the proposed format of the new BBC Three, as some thought the new format would be too similar to the BBC's commercial rivals, namely [[ITV2]] and [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]], and would be unnecessary competition. The channel was eventually given the go ahead, eleven months after the original launch date, and launched on 9 February 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2738245.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=BBC Three digital channel launches | date=10 February 2003}}</ref> The channel was launched by Stuart Murphy, who previously ran BBC Choice, and before that [[Play UK|UK Play]], the now-discontinued [[UKTV]] music and comedy channel.

These ratings by BARB, the official ratings agency, average out BBC Three's viewing figures over a 24-hour period even though the channel only broadcasts in the evening, giving a distorted sense of the channel's viewership. Despite several official complaints from the BBC, BARB continued to publish figures which the BBC argues are unrepresentative.{{when|date=May 2019}}{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nBBC Three's programming consisted of comedy, drama, spin-off series and repeated episodes of series from BBC One and BBC Two, and other programmes that attempted to alert others of their actions through a series of programmes challenging common beliefs.\n\nAn example of BBC Three's comedy output includes the award-winning comedy ''[[Little Britain]]'', which in October 2004 broke its previous viewing record when 1.8 million viewers tuned in for a new series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/225419/BBC-Three-last-laugh-Little-Britains-2m-ratings/?HAYILC=RELATED |title=BBC Three has last laugh with Little Britain's 2m ratings |last=Matthews |first=Sam |date=20 October 2004 |work=Brand Republic |accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref> ''Little Britain'' was later broadcast on the BBC's terrestrial analogue channels BBC One and BBC Two. The channels longest-running comedy programme is ''[[Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps]]''. Some current programmes feature stand-up comedians performing their own take on a subject, usually the news, examples of which include ''[[Russell Howard's Good News]]'' (which later transferred to [[BBC Two]], partly due to its success, and partly to BBC Three's move to online only) and ''[[Lee Nelson's Well Good Show]]''.\n\n===Comedy and drama===\nThe channel aired various comedies and dramas; one of its most popular sitcoms was ''[[Gavin & Stacey]]'', which first aired in May 2007 and was written by and starring [[James Corden]] and [[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]] alongside [[Mathew Horne]], [[Joanna Page]], [[Alison Steadman]] and [[Rob Brydon]]. The sitcom was an instant hit, with subsequent series being moved to other BBC channels and the show being granted a Christmas special. Another example is ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]'', a drama in which a ghost, a [[vampire]] and a [[werewolf]] share a flat, which has become a success and heralded several new series. American programming also features, with ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'' being the notable examples.\n\nNumerous popular series were either repeated on the channel or have spin-offs created from them. In early 2003, viewers could watch episodes of popular BBC soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' on BBC Three before they were broadcast on BBC One. This programming decision coincided with the relaunch of the channel and helped it break the one million viewers milestone for the first time. An episode of ''EastEnders Revealed'', which was commissioned for BBC Three and looking behind the scenes of the programme, attracted 611,000 viewers. In 2005, BBC Three commissioned the documentary series ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'', which was shown immediately after episodes of the new series of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' had been screened on BBC One. This was followed up in July 2005, when it began to screen repeats of both programmes.\n\nIn October 2005, it was announced that BBC Three had commissioned a spin-off drama series from ''Doctor Who'', ''[[Torchwood]]'', designed as a post-[[watershed (television)|watershed]] science fiction drama for a more adult audience. ''Torchwood'' launched with 2.4 million viewers in October 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=Torchwood scores record audience |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6077078.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=23 October 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2008}}</ref> ''Torchwood'' is the first science fiction programme ever to have been commissioned by the channel, and its popularity led to it being broadcast on BBC Two for the second series, and on BBC One for subsequent series. In 2010, BBC Three began airing episodes of the fifth series of BBC drama series ''[[Waterloo Road (TV series)|Waterloo Road]]'' after they had aired on BBC One as part of its 'catch-up' programming. From January 2015, BBC Three aired the remaining episodes of ''Waterloo Road'' before being repeated on BBC One later the same day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s24/waterloo-road/news/a615903/waterloo-road-to-lose-primetime-bbc-one-slot.html |title=Waterloo Road to lose primetime BBC One slot |work=Digital Spy |date=11 December 2014 |accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nAmong its original programming, the channel also gave viewers the [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Pramface]]'', which was written by Chris Reddy and comprised 19 episodes over three series, broadcast between 2012 and 2014.\n\n===Documentaries===\nBBC Three also airs highly acclaimed documentaries reflecting young people's experience of the world, including the [[Bafta]] winning ''Our War'', ''[[Blood, Sweat and T-shirts]]'' (as well as subsequent sequels), ''Life & Death Row'' and their recent{{when?|date=March 2020}} season of films about mental illness.

They are presented in a relaxed style in keeping with the rest of the channel. As part of the BBC's discussions with the government regarding the founding of the channel, a longer news programme had been promised to provide a daily section of news and current affairs. ''The News Show'', as it came to be called upon launch, was later rebranded ''[[The 7 O'Clock News]]''. However, the BBC discontinued the bulletin in 2005, following a recommendation made in the 2004 Barwise Report, which found that the channel's target audience sought news from elsewhere.<ref>{{cite news |date=21 October 2005 |title=BBC Three drops nightly news show |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4365628.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe channel also showed some sports programming.

The idea used by both Lambie-Nairn, who had developed the branding for [[CBeebies]] and [[CBBC]], and Aardman, was to create the BBC Three blobs as a relation to the green and yellow blobs of the children's channels. Kieron Elliott, Lola Buckley, Gavin Inskip and Jen Long provided out-of-vision continuity.\n\nOn 22 January 2008 a new channel identity was unveiled. Rebranding was carried out by [[Red Bee Media]], along with agencies MPG and Agency Republic with music and sound design by creative audio company Koink.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koink.uk.com|title=Home \u2013 Creative Production \u2013 Original Music \u2013 Koink|accessdate=11 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Discovery idents were introduced in October 2013 and lasted until January 2016, retaining the logo from 2008.
