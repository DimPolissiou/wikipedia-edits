The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and writer-artist [[Jack Kirby]], first appearing in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #52 ([[cover-date]]d July 1966) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. Black Panther's real name is '''T'Challa''', king and protector of the fictional African nation of [[Wakanda]]. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.\n\nBlack Panther is the first superhero of [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|African descent]]<!--People of African descent include Africans. This is a stronger statement than simply saying \"first African superhero\".--> in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early [[Black people|black]] superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] (1969), [[Luke Cage]] (1972) and [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] (1973) or [[DC Comics]]' [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] in the role of [[Green Lantern]] (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by [[White Tiger (Kasper Cole)|Kasper Cole]], a multiracial [[New York City]] [[New York City Police Department|police officer]]. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda is also given to T'Challa's sister [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]] for a short time.\n\nBlack Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films and video games. [[Chadwick Boseman]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019). Boseman will return in the upcoming sequel to ''Black Panther'' (2022).\n\nIn 2011, Black Panther was ranked 51st overall on [[IGN]]'s \"Top 100 Comic Books Heroes\" list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/lists/comic-book-heroes/51 |title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes: #51 Black Panther |website=IGN}}</ref>\n\n==Concept and creation==\n===Name===\nThe Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the [[Black Panther Party]], though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] (LCFO), nor the [[Racial segregation|segregated]] [[World War II]] [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|Black Panthers Tank Battalion]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/11/27/comic-book-legends-revealed-183/|title= Comic Book Legends Revealed #183 |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |last= Cronin|first= Brian |date= December 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Yuen/BPP_logo.html |title= Origin of the Black Panther Party logo |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |work= H.K.

In addition to ruling the country, he is also [[paramount chief]] of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions.

After becoming Black Panther and helping Captain America to take out Crossbones, T'Challa makes off with Captain America's shield claiming that it was stolen property. This leads [[Captain America]] to bring [[Iron Man]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to [[Wakanda]] in order to reclaim it. During the confrontation, Black Panther claims that [[Howard Stark]] stole vibranium in order to make Captain America's shield. To make matters worse, Ulysses Klaue appears where he makes off with Captain America's shield upon using a sound attack on the group. Both sides work to find Klaue as Captain America states to Black Panther that T'Chaka gave the vibranium for Stark to make into Captain America's shield. Tracking him to a hideout in the [[Himalayas]], the Avengers and Black Panther engage Klaue in an armor made out of vibranium. With a special tactic, the Avengers and Black Panther were able to knock Klaue out of the armor as Black Panther plans to make Ulysses Klaue answer for his crimes. With Klaue's vibranium armor in Wakandan custody, Black Panther changes his opinion of the Avengers and is offered reserve membership into the group. In the show's fourth season ''Avengers: Secret Wars'', Black Panther becomes the new leader of the All-New, All-Different Avengers (consisting of himself, [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]], [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]], [[Hope Pym|Wasp]], [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], and [[Kamala Khan|Ms. Marvel]]) after the original team disappears.

The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and writer-artist [[Jack Kirby]], first appearing in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #52 ([[cover-date]]d July 1966) in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. Black Panther's real name is '''T'Challa''', king and protector of the fictional African nation of [[Wakanda]]. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.\n\nBlack Panther is the first superhero of [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|African descent]]<!--People of African descent include Africans. This is a stronger statement than simply saying \"first African superhero\".--> in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early [[Black people|black]] superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] (1969), [[Luke Cage]] (1972) and [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] (1973) or [[DC Comics]]' [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] in the role of [[Green Lantern]] (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by [[White Tiger (Kasper Cole)|Kasper Cole]], a multiracial [[New York City]] [[New York City Police Department|police officer]]. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda is also given to T'Challa's sister [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]] for a short time.\n\nBlack Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films and video games. [[Chadwick Boseman]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019). Boseman will return in the upcoming sequel to ''Black Panther'' (2022).\n\nIn 2011, Black Panther was ranked 51st overall on [[IGN]]'s \"Top 100 Comic Books Heroes\" list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/lists/comic-book-heroes/51 |title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes: #51 Black Panther |website=IGN}}</ref>\n\n==Concept and creation==\n===Name===\nThe Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the [[Black Panther Party]], though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] (LCFO), nor the [[Racial segregation|segregated]] [[World War II]] [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|Black Panthers Tank Battalion]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/11/27/comic-book-legends-revealed-183/|title= Comic Book Legends Revealed #183 |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |last= Cronin|first= Brian |date= December 5, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Yuen/BPP_logo.html |title= Origin of the Black Panther Party logo |accessdate=December 13, 2008 |work= H.K.

In addition to ruling the country, he is also [[paramount chief]] of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but one must still earn it.\n\nIn the distant past, a [[meteorite]] made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral [[vibranium]] crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler, King [[T'Chaka]], like his father and other Panthers before him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife N'Yami died while in labor with '''T'Challa''', and his second wife [[Ramonda (comics)|Ramonda]] was taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius during a visit to her homeland of [[South Africa]], so for most of his childhood T'Challa was raised by his father alone.<ref name=\"MCP13-37\">''Marvel Comics Presents'' #13\u201337 (February\u2013December 1989)</ref> T'Chaka was murdered by the adventurer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaw]] in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound.

While on his Wakandan [[walkabout]] [[rite of passage]], T'Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]], who would grow up to become the X-Men member Storm.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #100 (Dec. 1980), revised in ''Storm'' vol. 2, #1\u20136 (2006)</ref> The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.\n\nT'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes.

Angry that his father has decided to share Wakanda's technology in exchange for America's help in saving T'Challa's life, M'Baku leaves the kingdom.\n\nTo save T'Challa, T'Chaka turns him over to the Weapon X program. Over a year later, a healthy T'Challa, in his full Black Panther garb, has enhanced speed, strength, night vision, and healing ability.

Tracking him to a hideout in the [[Himalayas]], the Avengers and Black Panther engage Klaue in an armor made out of vibranium. With a special tactic, the Avengers and Black Panther were able to knock Klaue out of the armor as Black Panther plans to make Ulysses Klaue answer for his crimes.

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]]. The satellite campus advocated a UC education to prospective college-bound students of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, UC Merced closed its Bakersfield campus in a cost-cutting effort.

During the Fall 2005 semester, while construction of the Classroom and Science/Engineering buildings was still taking place, all academic courses were conducted in the library.  Its official motto is \"Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.\"\n\nThe Library building is named after Leo and Dottie Kolligian. Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books. In addition, the library provides access to 580 databases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.ucmerced.edu/about/library-facts |title=Library Facts |publisher=UC Merced Library |accessdate=2014-06-02}}</ref>\n\nKolligian is a [[Green library]] and has Gold [[LEED certification]].<ref name=\"SignKolligian\">{{cite web|url=http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|title=Leo & Dottie Kolligian Library Sign|accessdate=20 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227010331/http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|UC Merced Golden Bobcats}}\n\nUC Merced's recently established an intercollegiate athletic program presently competes in the [[California Pacific Conference]] of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]].

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]]. The satellite campus advocated a UC education to prospective college-bound students of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, UC Merced closed its Bakersfield campus in a cost-cutting effort.

During the Fall 2005 semester, while construction of the Classroom and Science/Engineering buildings was still taking place, all academic courses were conducted in the library.  Its official motto is \"Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.\"\n\nThe Library building is named after Leo and Dottie Kolligian. Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books. In addition, the library provides access to 580 databases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.ucmerced.edu/about/library-facts |title=Library Facts |publisher=UC Merced Library |accessdate=2014-06-02}}</ref>\n\nKolligian is a [[Green library]] and has Gold [[LEED certification]].<ref name=\"SignKolligian\">{{cite web|url=http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|title=Leo & Dottie Kolligian Library Sign|accessdate=20 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227010331/http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|UC Merced Golden Bobcats}}\n\nUC Merced's recently established an intercollegiate athletic program presently competes in the [[California Pacific Conference]] of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]].

The constitution and by-laws were prepared by them. They were then approved by all the graduate students.\n\nThe undergraduate students of UC Merced have initiated and established their own student government.

Arnesen was the Director of Football at English football clubs [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and was Sporting Director at [[Hamburger SV]], [[Metalist Kharkiv]] and [[PAOK FC]]. Arnesen is set to become the Sporting Director at Dutch football club [[Feyenoord]] in January 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.feyenoord.nl/nieuws/nieuwsoverzicht/frank-arnesen-nieuwe-technisch-directeur-feyenoord---201119|title=Frank Arnesen nieuwe technisch directeur Feyenoord|language=Dutch|work=Feyenoord|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=20 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs a player, he most notably played with Dutch clubs [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[PSV Eindhoven]], winning the 1988 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] with PSV. Arnesen was [[Cap (sport)|capped]] 52 times and scored 14 goals for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]], and participated in the [[1984 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 1984]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] tournaments.\n\n==Playing career==\nArnesen moved from his childhood club [[Fremad Amager]], in the lower leagues of Danish football, to the big Dutch team [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in November/December 1975. At the time he was only 19, and made the move together with Fremad Amager and teammate [[S\u00f8ren Lerby]], who was only 17. Arnesen got his debut with Ajax 3 or 4 months later, on 7 March 1976, in a 1\u20131 draw with [[FC Utrecht]]. It was also in his time at Ajax, that Arnesen debuted for the Danish national team, in a 1977 friendly 1\u20130 loss against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], in [[Malm\u00f6]]. In Arnesen's six seasons at Ajax, he won three Dutch [[Eredivisie]] championship titles in 1977, 1979, and 1980, and won the [[KNVB Cup]] in 1979, beating [[FC Twente]] 3\u20130 in the final. In 1978, 1980 and 1981, Ajax also reached the [[KNVB Cup]] finals, but lost. In 1980, Arnesen and Ajax reached the semi-final of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], before they were eliminated by English team [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (2\u20130 away loss, 1\u20130 home win).\n\nIn the summer of 1981, Arnesen was bought by the Spanish football club [[Valencia CF]], and two years later he went to [[Belgium]] to play for [[RSC Anderlecht]]. In November 1985, Arnesen returned to the Netherlands to play for Ajax' rivals [[PSV Eindhoven]]. Here he saw three extremely successful seasons, winning the Eredivisie three years in a row, in 1986, 1987, and 1988, with fellow Danes [[Jan Heintze]], [[S\u00f8ren Lerby]] and [[Ivan Nielsen]]. Arnesen stopped his international career in 1987, after the Danish team qualified for the [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 1988]]. In 1988, he won the KNVB Cup once more, and he was part of the PSV team that conquered the European Cup, though he did not play in the final match due to an injury.\n\n==Management career==\nAfter his active career, Arnesen was first appointed assistant coach at PSV under [[Bobby Robson]] from 1991 to 1993, and in 1994 he became the club's general manager. Arnesen spent 10 years as director of football at PSV Eindhoven, and was credited with discovering major talents, such as [[Brazil]]ian striker [[Ronaldo Lu\u00eds Naz\u00e1rio de Lima|Ronaldo]] and Dutch players [[Jaap Stam]], [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]], and [[Arjen Robben]]. In May 2004, Arnesen was brought to [[Tottenham Hotspur]], replacing [[David Pleat]]. Arnesen was to function as the manager responsible for player transfers and scouting for new talent, while coach [[Jacques Santini]] handled the daily training sessions and match setups; an arrangement identical to Arnesen's days as PSV manager. Things didn't work out well, and Santini left within months citing \"personal problems\" as his reason for leaving. Arnesen's original hiring for assistant coach, [[Martin Jol]], was put in charge of the club.\n\nArnesen was suspended by Spurs on 4 June 2005 for expressing a desire to move to rival club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], after Chelsea allegedly made an illegal approach to sign him as manager. Arnesen was photographed aboard one of [[Roman Abramovich]]'s three luxury yachts on 22 June 2005 thus reinforcing Tottenham's compensation claim. Arnesen was recommended to Abramovich by [[Piet de Visser (football manager)|Piet de Visser]]. Later on one of the reasons to end [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]]'s contract would have been that Mourinho did not want to engage with Abramovich's football consultants.<ref>[http://m.bbc.com/sport/football/23064770 Ten years as Chelsea's secretive Russian owner], bbc, 2013-07-1, retrieved 2014-01-30.</ref> On 24 June, both clubs announced that they had reached a financial settlement, later disclosed to be \u00a35 million but widely reported to be closer to \u00a38 million, and Arnesen would move to Chelsea, filling in the role of head talent scout, in charge of uncovering footballing talents. Arnesen has since played a key role in bringing [[Salomon Kalou]], [[Florent Malouda]] and [[John Obi Mikel]] to Chelsea. But the club has still pursued expensive purchases of established international players rather than unearthing and developing young talent as hoped. On 27 November 2010 Chelsea announced that Arnesen had resigned as sporting director and would be leaving the club at the end of the 2010\u201311 season. On 20 February he decided to join [[Hamburger SV]] for the foreseeable future as sporting director.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2231696|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140624130240/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2231696|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 June 2014|title=Arnesen resigns|work=Chelsea F.C.|date=27 November 2010|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs a Hamburg SV Sporting Director, Arnesen took Chelsea youngsters to Hamburg like [[Jacopo Sala]], [[Michael Mancienne]], [[G\u00f6khan T\u00f6re]], [[Slobodan Rajkovi\u0107]] (all permanent) and [[Jeffrey Bruma]] (on loan).\nOn 10 October 2011 Arnesen took over the additional task of the head coach of Hamburger SV for just one match before hiring and installing a permanent new coach with [[Thorsten Fink]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hsv.de/en/season/meldungen/bundesliga/october-2011/frank-arnesen-in-temporary-double-function/|title=Frank Arnesen in temporary double-function|work=Hamburger SV|date=10 October 2011|accessdate=10 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802230000/http://www.hsv.de/en/season/meldungen/bundesliga/october-2011/frank-arnesen-in-temporary-double-function/|archivedate=2 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 May 2013 Hamburg SV confirmed that Arnesen had agreed to depart from his role as Sporting Director at the club.

I got acquainted with all staff during this short period and realized that true professionals and very nice people work in the club. Also I would like to apologize to the fans, but the circumstances were stronger than me. The situation in Ukraine forced me to make this choice.

Arnesen was the Director of Football at English football clubs [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and was Sporting Director at [[Hamburger SV]], [[Metalist Kharkiv]] and [[PAOK FC]]. Arnesen is set to become the Sporting Director at Dutch football club [[Feyenoord]] in January 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.feyenoord.nl/nieuws/nieuwsoverzicht/frank-arnesen-nieuwe-technisch-directeur-feyenoord---201119|title=Frank Arnesen nieuwe technisch directeur Feyenoord|language=Dutch|work=Feyenoord|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=20 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs a player, he most notably played with Dutch clubs [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[PSV Eindhoven]], winning the 1988 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] with PSV. Arnesen was [[Cap (sport)|capped]] 52 times and scored 14 goals for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]], and participated in the [[1984 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 1984]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] tournaments.\n\n==Playing career==\nArnesen moved from his childhood club [[Fremad Amager]], in the lower leagues of Danish football, to the big Dutch team [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in November/December 1975. At the time he was only 19, and made the move together with Fremad Amager and teammate [[S\u00f8ren Lerby]], who was only 17. Arnesen got his debut with Ajax 3 or 4 months later, on 7 March 1976, in a 1\u20131 draw with [[FC Utrecht]]. It was also in his time at Ajax, that Arnesen debuted for the Danish national team, in a 1977 friendly 1\u20130 loss against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], in [[Malm\u00f6]]. In Arnesen's six seasons at Ajax, he won three Dutch [[Eredivisie]] championship titles in 1977, 1979, and 1980, and won the [[KNVB Cup]] in 1979, beating [[FC Twente]] 3\u20130 in the final. In 1980, Arnesen and Ajax reached the semi-final of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], before they were eliminated by English team [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (2\u20130 away loss, 1\u20130 home win).\n\nIn the summer of 1981, Arnesen was bought by the Spanish football club [[Valencia CF]], and two years later he went to [[Belgium]] to play for [[RSC Anderlecht]]. In November 1985, Arnesen returned to the Netherlands to play for Ajax' rivals [[PSV Eindhoven]]. Here he saw three extremely successful seasons, winning the Eredivisie three years in a row, in 1986, 1987, and 1988, with fellow Danes [[Jan Heintze]], [[S\u00f8ren Lerby]] and [[Ivan Nielsen]]. Arnesen stopped his international career in 1987, after the Danish team qualified for the [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 1988]]. In 1988, he won the KNVB Cup once more, and he was part of the PSV team that conquered the European Cup, though he did not play in the final match due to an injury.\n\n==Management career==\nAfter his active career, Arnesen was first appointed assistant coach at PSV under [[Bobby Robson]] from 1991 to 1993, and in 1994 he became the club's general manager. Arnesen spent 10 years as director of football at PSV Eindhoven, and was credited with discovering major talents, such as [[Brazil]]ian striker [[Ronaldo Lu\u00eds Naz\u00e1rio de Lima|Ronaldo]] and Dutch players [[Jaap Stam]], [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]], and [[Arjen Robben]]. In May 2004, Arnesen was brought to [[Tottenham Hotspur]], replacing [[David Pleat]]. Arnesen was to function as the manager responsible for player transfers and scouting for new talent, while coach [[Jacques Santini]] handled the daily training sessions and match setups; an arrangement identical to Arnesen's days as PSV manager. Things didn't work out well, and Santini left within months citing \"personal problems\" as his reason for leaving. Arnesen's original hiring for assistant coach, [[Martin Jol]], was put in charge of the club.\n\nArnesen was suspended by Spurs on 4 June 2005 for expressing a desire to move to rival club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], after Chelsea allegedly made an illegal approach to sign him as manager. Arnesen was photographed aboard one of [[Roman Abramovich]]'s three luxury yachts on 22 June 2005 thus reinforcing Tottenham's compensation claim. Arnesen was recommended to Abramovich by [[Piet de Visser (football manager)|Piet de Visser]]. Later on one of the reasons to end [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]]'s contract would have been that Mourinho did not want to engage with Abramovich's football consultants.<ref>[http://m.bbc.com/sport/football/23064770 Ten years as Chelsea's secretive Russian owner], bbc, 2013-07-1, retrieved 2014-01-30.</ref> On 24 June, both clubs announced that they had reached a financial settlement, later disclosed to be \u00a35 million but widely reported to be closer to \u00a38 million, and Arnesen would move to Chelsea, filling in the role of head talent scout, in charge of uncovering footballing talents. Arnesen has since played a key role in bringing [[Salomon Kalou]], [[Florent Malouda]] and [[John Obi Mikel]] to Chelsea. But the club has still pursued expensive purchases of established international players rather than unearthing and developing young talent as hoped. On 27 November 2010 Chelsea announced that Arnesen had resigned as sporting director and would be leaving the club at the end of the 2010\u201311 season. On 20 February he decided to join [[Hamburger SV]] for the foreseeable future as sporting director.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2231696|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140624130240/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2231696|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 June 2014|title=Arnesen resigns|work=Chelsea F.C.|date=27 November 2010|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs a Hamburg SV Sporting Director, Arnesen took Chelsea youngsters to Hamburg like [[Jacopo Sala]], [[Michael Mancienne]], [[G\u00f6khan T\u00f6re]], [[Slobodan Rajkovi\u0107]] (all permanent) and [[Jeffrey Bruma]] (on loan).\nOn 10 October 2011 Arnesen took over the additional task of the head coach of Hamburger SV for just one match before hiring and installing a permanent new coach with [[Thorsten Fink]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hsv.de/en/season/meldungen/bundesliga/october-2011/frank-arnesen-in-temporary-double-function/|title=Frank Arnesen in temporary double-function|work=Hamburger SV|date=10 October 2011|accessdate=10 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802230000/http://www.hsv.de/en/season/meldungen/bundesliga/october-2011/frank-arnesen-in-temporary-double-function/|archivedate=2 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 May 2013 Hamburg SV confirmed that Arnesen had agreed to depart from his role as Sporting Director at the club.

This position was only held for a month as Arnesen and FC metalist agreed that Arnesen could leave the club due to the ongoing violent political situation in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking on the official FC Metalist Kharkiv website Arnesen said:\n\n\"I want to thank everyone in \"Metalist\". I got acquainted with all staff during this short period and realized that true professionals and very nice people work in the club. Also I would like to apologize to the fans, but the circumstances were stronger than me. The situation in Ukraine forced me to make this choice.

Originally based at [[Exhibition Stadium]], the team began playing its home games at [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] upon its opening in 1989. Since 2000, the Blue Jays have been owned by [[Rogers Communications]] and in 2004, SkyDome was purchased by that company, which renamed it [[Rogers Centre]]. They are the second MLB franchise to be based outside the United States, and currently the only team based outside the U.S. after the first Canadian franchise, the [[Montreal Expos]], became the [[Washington Nationals]] in 2005.<!-- American does not always refer to the United States in this case. -->\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Blue Jays went through struggles typical of an expansion team, frequently finishing in last place in its division. In 1983, the team had its [[1983 Toronto Blue Jays season|first winning season]] and two years later, they became [[1985 Toronto Blue Jays season|division champions]]. From 1985 to 1993, they were an AL East powerhouse, winning five division championships in nine seasons, including three consecutive from [[1991 Toronto Blue Jays season|1991]] to [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|1993]]. During that run, the team also became back-to-back [[World Series]] champions in [[1992 World Series|1992]] and [[1993 World Series|1993]], led by a core group of [[List of Major League Baseball awards|award]]-winning [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] players, including [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Roberto Alomar]], [[Joe Carter]], [[John Olerud]], and [[Devon White (baseball)|Devon White]]. The Blue Jays became the first (and, to date, only) team outside the US to appear in and win a World Series, and the fastest AL expansion team to do so, winning in its 16th year. As of [[2019 Major League Baseball season|2019]], they are one of only two MLB franchises that are undefeated through multiple World Series appearances, along with the [[National League]]'s [[Miami Marlins]]. After 1993, the Blue Jays failed to qualify for the playoffs for 21 consecutive seasons, until clinching a playoff berth and division championship in [[2015 Toronto Blue Jays season|2015]]. The team clinched a second consecutive playoff berth in [[2016 Toronto Blue Jays season|2016]], after securing an [[List of American League Wild Card winners|AL wild card]] position. In both years, the Jays won the [[American League Division Series|AL Division Series]] but lost the [[American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]].\n\nThe Blue Jays and the [[Atlanta Braves]] are the only two MLB teams under corporate ownership; the Blue Jays are also the only American League team to be under such ownership.\n{{toc limit|3}}\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Toronto Blue Jays}}\n\n===Expansion team===\nThe Blue Jays were approved as part of the [[1977 Major League Baseball expansion]] discussions, after Toronto's original plan of getting a Major League Baseball team by luring the Giants from San Francisco fell through; they would be added alongside the Seattle Mariners.

The game is now perhaps best remembered for the minor snowstorm which began just before the game started. Toronto won the snowy affair 9\u20135, led by [[Doug Ault]]'s two [[home run]]s. That win would be one of only 54 of the 1977 season, as the [[1977 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] finished last in the AL East, with a record of 54\u2013107. After the season, assistant general manager [[Pat Gillick]] succeeded [[Peter Bavasi]] as general manager of the team, a position he would hold until 1994.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 1978, [[1978 Toronto Blue Jays season|the team]] improved their record by five games, but remained last, with a record of 59\u2013102. In 1979, after a 53\u2013109 [[1979 Toronto Blue Jays season|last place finish]], shortstop [[Alfredo Griffin]] was named American League co-[[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]]. In addition, the Blue Jays' first mascot, [[BJ Birdy]], made its debut in 1979.\n\nIn 1980, [[Bobby Mattick]] became manager, succeeding [[Roy Hartsfield]], the Blue Jays' original manager. In Mattick's first season as manager, although they remained at the bottom, [[1980 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto]] almost reached the 70-win mark, finishing with a record of 67\u201395, a 14-win improvement on 1979. [[Jim Clancy (baseball)|Jim Clancy]] led with 13 wins and [[John Mayberry]] became the first Jay to hit 30 home runs in a season.\n\nIn the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike]]-divided season of 1981, the [[1981 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] finished in last place in the AL East in both halves of the season. They were a dismal 16\u201342 in the first half, but improved dramatically, finishing the 48-game second half at 21\u201327, for a combined record of 37\u201369.\n\n====1982\u20131984====\nUnder new manager [[Bobby Cox]], Toronto's first solid season came in 1982<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwIrDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT100|page=100|title=From Hockey to Baseball: I kept them in stitches|author=Ken Carson and Larry Millson|publisher=FriesenPress|date=2016|isbn=9781460280126}}</ref> as they finished 78\u201384.

The Blue Jays featured strong pitching and a balanced offence. Tony Fern\u00e1ndez excelled in his first full season, and veteran pitcher [[Doyle Alexander]] led the team with 17 wins, including a division-clinching complete game win. Their mid-season call up of relief pitcher [[Tom Henke]] also proved to be important. They finished 99\u201362 (the franchise record for most wins), two games in front of the [[1985 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]]. The Blue Jays faced the [[1985 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] in the [[1985 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] (ALCS), and took a three games to one lead. However, Kansas City won three consecutive games to win the series 4\u20133, on the way to their first [[1985 World Series|World Series]] championship. The Blue Jays' successful season was dubbed the \"Drive of '85\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Drive of '85: A Salute to the Blue Jays by the Toronto Star|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZoYAAAACAAJ|first1=Wayne|last1=Braun|first2=Jack  |last2=Brehl|publisher=Doubleday Canada|year=1985 |isbn=978-0-385-25037-5}}</ref>\n\nAfter the playoffs, Cox, the [[Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award|AL Manager of the Year]], suddenly left the Blue Jays to become general manager of the [[1986 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], the team he previously managed.\n\n====1986\u20131988====\nWith [[Jimy Williams]]<!-- Jimy's name is spelled with one \"m\" --> taking over for Cox as manager, the [[1986 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] could not duplicate their success in 1986, sliding to a fourth-place tie at 86\u201376. [[Jesse Barfield]] and [[George Bell (outfielder)|George Bell]] led the way with 40 and 31 home runs, respectively, while [[Jim Clancy (baseball)|Jim Clancy]], [[Mark Eichhorn]], and [[Jimmy Key]] tied for the team wins lead with 14 each.\n\nIn 1987, the [[1987 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] held a 3\u00bd-game lead with a week to go in the season, then lost their last seven in a row to finish two games back of the [[1987 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], getting swept on the last weekend by the Tigers. The Blue Jays finished with a 96\u201366 record, second best in the major leagues, but to no avail. However, George Bell (.308 [[batting average (baseball)|AVG]], 47 HR, 134 RBI) was named the AL's [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP), the first Blue Jay to earn that honour.\n\nIn 1988, however, [[1988 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto]] could not duplicate the successes of the previous season. They tied the [[1988 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] for third in the division at 87\u201375, only two games behind the division champion [[1988 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. Still, the season had numerous highlights. First baseman [[Fred McGriff]] hit 34 home runs, and Dave Stieb had back-to-back starts in which he lost a [[no-hitter]] with two out and two strikes in the ninth inning.\n\n====1989\u20131991: Cito Gaston takes charge, two more AL East titles====\n[[File:Cito.jpg|thumb|[[Cito Gaston]] was named as the Blue Jays' manager during the [[1989 Major League Baseball season|1989]] season.]]\nIn 1989, the [[1989 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays']] new [[retractable roof]]ed home, [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]], opened mid-season. It also marked the beginning of an extremely successful five-year period for the team. In May, management fired manager Jimy<!-- This is the correct spelling --> Williams and replaced him with [[Cito Gaston]], the team's hitting instructor. The club had a dismal 12\u201324 record at the time of the firing, but went 77\u201349 under Gaston to win the AL East title by two games, with an 89\u201373 record. On May 28, George Bell's [[walk-off home run]], off of [[1989 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] closer [[Bobby Thigpen]], marked the end of the Exhibition Stadium era. The first game at the new stadium took place on June 5 against the [[1989 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]; the Jays lost 5\u20133. In the [[1989 American League Championship Series|1989 ALCS]], [[Rickey Henderson]] led the [[1989 World Series|World Series]] champion [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] to a 4\u20131 series win.\n\nIn 1990, the [[1990 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] again had a strong season, but finished in second place, two games behind the [[1990 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. Dave Stieb pitched his only no-hitter, beating the [[1990 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] 3\u20130 in front of a less than capacity crowd at [[Cleveland Stadium|Cleveland Municipal Stadium]]. As of 2018, it remains the only no-hitter ever pitched by a Blue Jay. During the offseason, the Blue Jays made one of the two biggest trades in franchise history, sending All-Star shortstop [[Tony Fern\u00e1ndez]] and first baseman [[Fred McGriff]] to the [[San Diego Padres]] in exchange for outfielder [[Joe Carter]] and second baseman [[Roberto Alomar]]. The Jays also obtained centre<!-- Baseball terminology supersedes Canadian English in preference for this article --> fielder [[Devon White (baseball)|Devon White]] from the [[Los Angeles Angels|California Angels]]. These deals, particularly the trade with San Diego, were instrumental in the team's future success.\n\nCarter, Alomar and White would prove to be extremely effective additions, as the [[1991 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] again won the division in 1991, as Carter drove in Alomar for the division-winning run. Once again, however, they fell short in the postseason, losing to the [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]], who were on the way to their second [[1991 World Series|World Series]] victory in five seasons, in the [[1991 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. In 1991, the Blue Jays became the first Major League club ever to draw over [[Major League Baseball attendance records|four million fans]] in one season.\n\n* Team record 1989: 89 wins\u201373 losses, W%- 0.549\n* Team record 1990: 86 wins\u201376 losses, W%- 0.531, 2 games behind division leader\n* Team record 1991: 91 wins\u201371 losses, W%- 0.562\n\n====1992\u20131993: World Series champions====\n=====1992: Canada's first World Series title=====\n{{main|1992 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\nAfter the 1991 season had ended, the Blue Jays acquired pitcher [[Jack Morris]], who had led the Minnesota Twins to victory in the World Series by pitching a 10-inning complete game shutout in Game 7 and had been named the [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series MVP]]. To add veteran leadership to their explosive offence, Toronto signed [[Dave Winfield]] to be the team's designated hitter.\n\nThe 1992 regular season went well, as the Jays clinched their second straight AL East crown with a final record of 96\u201366, four games ahead of the [[1992 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]. They also went the entire season without being swept in any series, becoming the first team in 49 years to accomplish the feat.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/1943-schedule-scores.shtml 1943 St. Louis Cardinals] Baseball-Reference.com. Accessed on June 13, 2014.</ref> The Blue Jays met the [[1992 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] (who had the same record as the Jays and won the [[American League West|AL West]] by six games over the defending champion [[1992 Minnesota Twins season|Twins]]) in the [[1992 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], winning four games to two. The pivotal game of the series was Game 4, considered by many to be one of the most important games in Blue Jays history: the Blue Jays rallied back from a 6\u20131 deficit after seven innings, capped off by [[Roberto Alomar]]'s huge game-tying two-run homer off A's closer [[Dennis Eckersley]] in the top of the ninth. This paved the way for a 7\u20136 victory in 11 innings, a 3-games-to-1 lead in the series and an eventual 4\u20132 ALCS series win.\n\nThe Blue Jays then faced the [[1992 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1992 World Series|World Series]]. The Braves returned after being beaten by the Twins the previous year. The pivotal game in this series turned out to be Game 2, in which reserve player [[Ed Sprague Jr.|Ed Sprague]] hit a 9th-inning two-run home run off Braves closer [[Jeff Reardon]] to give the Blue Jays a 5\u20134 lead, which would hold up. After winning Game 3 thanks to Candy Maldonado's ninth inning RBI hit and Game 4 due to Jimmy Key's superb 7\u2153 inning pitching effort in which he retired 15 straight batters (five innings), the Jays could not win the Series on home turf as the Braves struck back with a 7\u20132 win in Game 5. Game 6 in Atlanta, with the Blue Jays leading 3 games to 2, was a very close game. Toronto was one strike away from winning in the bottom of the 9th inning, 2\u20131,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ATL/ATL199210240.shtml |title=October 24, 1992 World Series Game 6 at Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium Play by Play and Box Score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=October 24, 1992 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref> but [[Otis Nixon]] singled in the tying run off the Blue Jays' closer [[Tom Henke]]. It was the first run the Toronto bullpen had given up in the series. The game was decided in the 11th inning, when [[Dave Winfield]] doubled down the left-field line, driving in two runs. The Braves would again come within one run in the bottom of the 11th, but Jays reliever [[Mike Timlin]] fielded [[Otis Nixon]]'s bunt, throwing to Joe Carter at first base for the final out. The Blue Jays became the first team based outside of the United States to win the World Series. [[Pat Borders]], the Jays' catcher, was the unlikely player who was named MVP after hitting .450 with one home run in the World Series. Oddly, Morris was acquired in large part for his reputation as a clutch postseason pitcher, but he went 0\u20133 in the playoffs. Morris, however, pitched well in the regular season, becoming the Blue Jays' first 20-game winner, with a record of 21\u20136 and an [[earned run average|ERA]] of 4.04.\n\n* Team record 1992: 96 wins\u201366 losses, W%- 0.593\n\n=====1993: Back-to-back champs=====\n{{main|1993 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\n[[File:Blue Jays Win the 1993 World Series.jpg|thumb|Fireworks at the [[Rogers Centre|Skydome]] following the Blue Jays' victory in the [[1993 World Series]].]]\nAfter the 1992 season, the Blue Jays let World Series hero Dave Winfield and longtime closer Tom Henke go, but signed two key free agents: designated hitter [[Paul Molitor]] from the Milwaukee Brewers and perennial playoff success [[Dave Stewart (baseball)|Dave Stewart]] from the Oakland Athletics.\n\nIn 1993, the Blue Jays had seven All-Stars: outfielders Devon White and Joe Carter, infielders [[John Olerud]] and Roberto Alomar, designated hitter Molitor, plus starting pitcher [[Pat Hentgen]], and closer [[Duane Ward]]. In August, the Jays acquired former nemesis [[Rickey Henderson]] from the Athletics. The Blue Jays cruised to a 95\u201367 record, seven games ahead of the [[1993 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], winning their third straight division title. The Jays beat the [[1993 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] four games to two in the [[1993 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], and then the [[1993 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]], four games to two, for their second straight [[1993 World Series|World Series]] victory. The World Series featured several exciting games, including Game 4, played under a slight rain, in which the Blue Jays came back from a 14\u20139 deficit to win 15\u201314 and take a 3 games to 1 lead in the series. It remains the highest scoring game in World Series history. Game 6 in Toronto saw the Blue Jays lead 5\u20131, but give up 5 runs in the 7th inning to trail 6\u20135. In the bottom of the 9th inning, Joe Carter hit a one-out, three-run walk-off home run to clinch the series off of Phillies closer [[Mitch Williams]]. Only the second World Series\u2013winning walk-off home run in the history of Major League Baseball (following [[Bill Mazeroski]]'s in Game 7 in [[1960 World Series|1960]]), Carter's hit differed from the first in that Toronto, while not facing elimination, was trailing in the bottom of the 9th. The home run is also memorable for late Blue Jays broadcaster [[Tom Cheek]]'s call:\n\n{{Quote box\n|width=98%\n|align=center\n|quote=A swing, and a belt! Left field! Way back! Blue Jays win it!

It was their first losing season since 1982. [[Joe Carter]], [[Paul Molitor]] and [[John Olerud]] enjoyed good years at the plate, but the pitching fell off. [[Juan Guzm\u00e1n (baseball)|Juan Guzm\u00e1n]] slumped considerably from his first three years (40\u201311, 3.28 ERA), finishing 1994 at 12\u201311 with a 5.68 ERA. Three young players, [[Alex Gonzalez (shortstop, born 1973)|Alex Gonzalez]], [[Carlos Delgado]] and [[Shawn Green]], did show much promise for the future. At the time of the strike, their fellow Canadian cousins, the [[1994 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]], had the best record in the majors, leading some to consider the possibility of a Canadian three-peat in 1994.\n\nOn October 31, 1994, Gillick, the longtime Blue Jays general manager, resigned and handed the reins of the team to assistant general manager and Toronto native [[Gord Ash]],<ref name=\"history\"/> who would lead the team in its most tumultuous era yet.\n\n* Team record 1994: 55 wins\u201360 losses, W%- 0.478, 16 games behind division leader\n\n===1995\u20132001: The Gord Ash era===\n\n====1995\u20132000====\nIn the 1995 season, the [[1995 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] proved that they had lost their contending swagger of the past 12 years. Although they had most of the same cast of the World Series teams, the Blue Jays freefell to a dismal 56\u201388 record, last place in the AL East, 30 games behind the [[1995 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. That year, team owner Labatt Breweries was bought by [[Belgium|Belgian]]-based brewer [[Interbrew]], making the Blue Jays the second major league team owned by interests outside of North America, after their expansion cousins, the [[Seattle Mariners]] (who were then owned by [[Nintendo]]).\n\n1996 was another mediocre year for the [[1996 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]], despite [[Pat Hentgen]]'s [[Cy Young Award]] (20\u201310, 3.22 ERA). [[Ed Sprague Jr.|Ed Sprague]] had a career year, hitting 36 home runs and driving in 101 runs. However, the team's 74 wins did put them in 4th place, improving over a last place finish in 1995.\n\nThe [[1997 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] started 1997 with high hopes. Not only did the Jays drastically change their uniforms, they signed former [[Boston Red Sox]] ace [[Roger Clemens]] to a $24.75 million contract. Clemens had one of the best pitching seasons ever as he won the pitcher's [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]], leading the American League with a record of 21\u20137, a 2.05 ERA, and 292 strikeouts. This was not enough to lead the Blue Jays to the postseason, however, as they finished in last place for the second time in three years with a record of 76\u201386. [[Cito Gaston]], the longtime manager who led the team to four division titles and two World Series crowns, was fired five games before the end of the season. The season did provide a unique experience for its fans with the advent of [[Interleague play]], when the Blue Jays faced their Canadian rival, the [[1997 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]], for the first official games between the two teams.\nBefore the start of the 1998 season, the [[1998 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] acquired closer [[Randy Myers]] and slugger [[Jose Canseco]]. Gaston was replaced with former Blue Jay [[Tim Johnson (baseball)|Tim Johnson]], a relative unknown as a manager. Despite mediocre hitting, strong pitching led by Clemens' second straight pitching Triple Crown (20\u20136, 2.65 ERA, 271 strikeouts) sparked the Blue Jays to an 88\u201374 record\u2014their first winning season since 1993. However, this was only good enough to finish a distant third, 26 games behind the [[1998 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], who posted one of the greatest records in all of baseball history at 114\u201348. They were, however, in contention for the wildcard spot until the final week.\n\nBefore the 1999 season, the Blue Jays traded Clemens to the Yankees for starting pitcher [[David Wells]], second baseman [[Homer Bush]] and relief pitcher [[Graeme Lloyd]]. They also fired manager Tim Johnson during spring training after he lied about several things (including killing people in the [[Vietnam War]]) to motivate his players. The Blue Jays had initially been willing to stand by Johnson. A blizzard of questions about his credibility during spring training, however, led Ash to fire him less than a month before opening day. Johnson was replaced with [[Jim Fregosi]], who managed the Phillies when they lost to the Blue Jays in the [[1993 World Series]]. The offence picked up somewhat in 1999, but the pitching suffered without Clemens, as the [[1999 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] finished at 84\u201378, in third place. After the 1999 season, the Blue Jays' original mascot for 20 years, BJ Birdy, was replaced by a duo named [[Toronto Blue Jays mascots|Ace and Diamond]].\n\nOn November 8, 1999, Toronto traded star outfielder [[Shawn Green]] to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for left-handed relief pitcher [[Pedro Borb\u00f3n Jr.|Pedro Borb\u00f3n]] and right-fielder [[Ra\u00fal Mondes\u00ed]]. Green had told the Jays that he would not be re-signing when his contract was up at the end of the year (he wished to play closer to his home in Southern California).\n\n2000 proved to be a similar season, as the [[2000 Toronto Blue Jays season|Jays]] had an 83\u201379 record, well out of the wild card race but only a slim 4\u00bd games back of the three-time defending World Series champion [[2000 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in the AL East, the first time since 1993 they had contended for the division. [[Carlos Delgado]] had a stellar year, hitting .344 with 41 home runs, 57 doubles, 137 RBI, 123 walks and 115 runs. In addition, six other players hit 20 or more home runs, an outstanding feat.\n\n====2000\u20132001====\n[[File:BobFile FenwayPark 2001 3.jpg|thumb|[[Bob File]] pitching for the Blue Jays at [[Fenway Park]] during the [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]] season.]]\nOn September 1, 2000, [[Rogers Communications]] Inc. purchased 80% of the baseball club for $160 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ted-rogers-buys-the-blue-jays-1.253587|title=Ted Rogers buys The Blue Jays\n|date=September 1, 2000|accessdate=December 28, 2013|work=[[CBC News]]}}</ref> with Interbrew (later [[InBev]]) maintaining 20% interest and the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] relinquishing its 10% share. Rogers eventually acquired the 20% owned by Interbrew and now has full ownership of the team.\n\nThe 2001 season marked the 25th anniversary of the franchise's inception. [[Buck Martinez]], a former catcher and broadcast announcer for the Blue Jays, took over as manager before the season began. The [[2001 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] had a disappointing season, as the team fell back under .500, finishing at 80\u201382, with mediocre pitching and hitting. Delgado led the team again with 39 home runs and 102 RBI. After the 2001 season ended, the Blue Jays fired Gord Ash, ending a seven-year tenure as general manager.\n\n[[J. P. Ricciardi]], then director of player development under [[Oakland Athletics]] general manager [[Billy Beane]], was named the Blue Jays' General Manager and was expected to slash the payroll immediately, to stem the tide of red ink. During the off-season, the team traded or let go several popular players, including [[Alex Gonzalez (shortstop, born 1973)|Alex Gonzalez]], [[Paul Quantrill]], [[Brad Fullmer]] and [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Billy Koch]] to let talented youngsters such as [[Eric Hinske]] and [[Felipe L\u00f3pez (baseball)|Felipe L\u00f3pez]] get a chance to develop into major leaguers.\n\n===2002\u20132009: The J. P. Ricciardi and Roy Halladay era===\n====2002 season====\n{{Main|2002 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\nThe Blue Jays started the 2002 season with slow progress in performance. [[Buck Martinez]] was fired about a third of the way through the season, with a 20\u201333 record. He was replaced by third base coach [[Carlos Tosca]], an experienced minor league manager. They went 58\u201351 under Tosca to finish the season 78\u201384. [[Roy Halladay]] was relied on as the team's ace and rose to the challenge of being the team's top pitcher, finishing the season with a 19\u20137 record and 2.93 ERA. The hitters were led once again by [[Carlos Delgado]]. Promising young players were assigned to key roles; starting third baseman [[Eric Hinske]] won the Rookie of the Year Award at the season's conclusion, and 23-year-old centre fielder [[Vernon Wells]] had his first 100 RBI season.\n\n* Team record 2002: 78 wins\u201384 losses, W%- 0.481, 25.5 games behind division leader, third in division\n\n====2003 season====\n{{Main|2003 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\nThe 2003 season was a surprise to both team management and baseball analysts. After a poor April, the team had its most successful month ever in May. Carlos Delgado led the majors in RBI, followed closely by Wells. Despite their hitting successes, poor pitching continued to plague the team. Halladay was an exception, winning his first [[Cy Young Award]], going 22\u20137, with a 3.25 ERA. In July, [[Shannon Stewart (baseball)|Shannon Stewart]] was traded to the [[Minnesota Twins]] for [[Bobby Kielty]], another outfielder with a much lower batting average than Stewart's. Although the Jays finished in third place in their division, Delgado was second in the voting for the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP Award]]. In the off-season, Kielty was traded to the [[Oakland Athletics]] for starter [[Ted Lilly]].\n\n* Team record 2003: 86 wins\u201376 losses, W%- 0.531, 15 games behind division leader, third in division\n\n====2004 season====\n{{Main|2004 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\nThe 2004 season was a disappointing year for the Blue Jays right from the beginning. They started the season 0\u20138 at SkyDome and never started a lengthy winning streak. Much of that was due to injuries to All-Stars Carlos Delgado, Vernon Wells and Roy Halladay among others. Although the additions of starting pitchers Ted Lilly and [[Miguel Batista]] and reliever [[Justin Speier]] were relatively successful, veteran [[Pat Hentgen]] faltered throughout the season and retired on July 24. Rookies and minor league callups [[Dave Bush|David Bush]], [[Jason Frasor]], [[Josh Towers]] and others filled the void in the rotation and the bullpen; however, inconsistent performances were evident. With the team struggling in last place and mired in a five-game losing streak, manager [[Carlos Tosca]] was fired on August 8, 2004, and was replaced by first base coach [[John Gibbons]]. Long-time first baseman Carlos Delgado became a free agent in the off-season. Nevertheless, prospects [[Russ Adams]], [[Gabe Gross]], and [[Alex R\u00edos]] provided excitement for the fans. Rookie pitchers David Bush, [[Gustavo Chac\u00edn]] and Jason Frasor also showed promise for the club's future. The Blue Jays' lone MLB All-Star Game representative was Lilly.\n\n* Team record 2004: 67 wins\u201394 losses, W%- 0.416, 33.5 games behind division leader, fifth in division\n\n====2005 season====\n[[Image:Toronto, Skydome, N.Y. Yankees vs. BlueJays.JPG|thumb|After the 2004 season, [[FieldTurf]] replaced [[AstroTurf]] as the Rogers Centre's playing surface.]]\n\n{{Main|2005 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\nSkyDome was renamed Rogers Centre and was extensively renovated. The Blue Jays had a good start to the 2005 season. They led the AL East from early to mid-April and held their record around .500 until late August. The Jays were hit with the injury bug when third baseman [[Corey Koskie]] broke his finger, taking him out of the line-up, but the club was pleasantly surprised with the performance of rookie call-up [[Aaron Hill (baseball)|Aaron Hill]] in his stead. On July 8, just prior to the All-Star break, Blue Jays ace Roy Halladay was struck on the shin by a line drive, resulting in a fractured leg. Though Halladay's injury was hoped to be minor, the recovery process was met with constant delays, and eventually, he was out for the rest of the season. Prior to his injury, the Blue Jays were in serious wild card contention, but soon fell out of the playoff race. The team received glimpses of the future from September call-ups [[Guillermo Quir\u00f3z]], [[John-Ford Griffin]], and [[Shaun Marcum]]. Marcum made himself noteworthy by posting an ERA of 0.00 over five relief appearances and eight innings in September. Josh Towers also stepped up, showing largely unseen potential by going 7\u20135 with a 2.91 ERA in the second half of the season.\n\n* Team record 2005: 80 wins\u201382 losses, W%- 0.494, 15 games behind division leader, third in division\n\n====2006 season====\n{{Main|2006 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\n\nIn 2006, the team experienced its most successful season in years.

The team played well in the critical month of September, going 18\u201310. This, combined with the slumping of the [[2006 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], enabled the Blue Jays to take sole possession of second place in the American League East by the end of the season. This marked the first time that the Jays had finished above third place in their division since their World Championship season of 1993, and with the most wins since the 1998 season. On December 18, the Blue Jays announced that they had re-signed centre fielder Wells to a seven-year contract worth $126 million, which came into effect after the 2007 season.\n\n* Team record 2006: 87 wins\u201375 losses, W%- 0.537, 10 games behind division leader, second in division\n\n====2007 season====\n[[File:Dustin McGowan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dustin McGowan]] pitching for the Blue Jays in the [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007]] season.]]\n{{Main|2007 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\nThe 2007 season was blighted by persistent injuries, with 12 Blue Jays landing on the disabled list. The most serious injury was that of B. J. Ryan, who was out for the entire season having had [[Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction|Tommy John surgery]]. Prior to the season, the team signed starting pitchers [[John Thomson (baseball)|John Thomson]], [[Tomo Ohka]], and [[V\u00edctor Zambrano]]; each of them was released before the end of the season. However, young starters [[Shaun Marcum]] and [[Dustin McGowan]] had break-out years, with 12 wins each. On June 24, McGowan pitched a complete game one-hitter. On June 28, [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]] became the 21st major league player to hit [[500 home run club|500 career home runs]].

For much of the season, however, the team struggled to hit home runs and drive in runs. On May 24, starter [[Jesse Litsch]] set a team record, with 38 consecutive innings without giving up a walk. On June 20, following a five-game losing streak and with the Jays in last place in the AL East, management fired [[John Gibbons]] and several members of his coaching staff, and re-hired [[Cito Gaston]]. Meanwhile, Alex R\u00edos had 32 stolen bases, making him the first Blue Jay with 30 since 2001. On September 5, Roy Halladay earned his 129th career win, moving him into second spot on Toronto's all-time wins list. Halladay also came second in the voting for the Cy Young Award, after posting a 20\u201311 record and 2.78 ERA.\n\n* Team record 2008: 86 wins\u201376 losses, W%- 0.531, 11 games behind division leader, fourth in division\n\n====2009 season====\n[[File:Roy Halladay 2009 (1).jpg|thumb|Blue Jays pitcher [[Roy Halladay]] during the [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009]] season.]]\n{{Main|2009 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\nThe 2009 season saw the addition of two new patches on the Blue Jays' uniforms: on the right arm, a bright red [[maple leaf]] (part of the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]]), and on the left arm, a small black band with \"TED\" written on it, in reference to the late team owner [[Edward S.

The patch was adorned with the letters 'TC', Cheek's initials, as well as a stylized [[microphone]]. Cheek is also honoured with a place in the Blue Jays' \"Level of Excellence\" in the upper level of the Rogers Centre; the number 4,306 is depicted beside his name. In 2008, Cheek received the third most votes by fans to be nominated for the [[Ford C. Frick Award]] for broadcasting excellence.

Originally based at [[Exhibition Stadium]], the team began playing its home games at [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] upon its opening in 1989. Since 2000, the Blue Jays have been owned by [[Rogers Communications]] and in 2004, SkyDome was purchased by that company, which renamed it [[Rogers Centre]]. They are the second MLB franchise to be based outside the United States, and currently the only team based outside the U.S. after the first Canadian franchise, the [[Montreal Expos]], became the [[Washington Nationals]] in 2005.<!-- American does not always refer to the United States in this case. -->\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Blue Jays went through struggles typical of an expansion team, frequently finishing in last place in its division. In 1983, the team had its [[1983 Toronto Blue Jays season|first winning season]] and two years later, they became [[1985 Toronto Blue Jays season|division champions]]. From 1985 to 1993, they were an AL East powerhouse, winning five division championships in nine seasons, including three consecutive from [[1991 Toronto Blue Jays season|1991]] to [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|1993]]. During that run, the team also became back-to-back [[World Series]] champions in [[1992 World Series|1992]] and [[1993 World Series|1993]], led by a core group of [[List of Major League Baseball awards|award]]-winning [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] players, including [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Roberto Alomar]], [[Joe Carter]], [[John Olerud]], and [[Devon White (baseball)|Devon White]]. The Blue Jays became the first (and, to date, only) team outside the US to appear in and win a World Series, and the fastest AL expansion team to do so, winning in its 16th year. As of [[2019 Major League Baseball season|2019]], they are one of only two MLB franchises that are undefeated through multiple World Series appearances, along with the [[National League]]'s [[Miami Marlins]]. After 1993, the Blue Jays failed to qualify for the playoffs for 21 consecutive seasons, until clinching a playoff berth and division championship in [[2015 Toronto Blue Jays season|2015]]. The team clinched a second consecutive playoff berth in [[2016 Toronto Blue Jays season|2016]], after securing an [[List of American League Wild Card winners|AL wild card]] position. In both years, the Jays won the [[American League Division Series|AL Division Series]] but lost the [[American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]].\n\nThe Blue Jays and the [[Atlanta Braves]] are the only two MLB teams under corporate ownership; the Blue Jays are also the only American League team to be under such ownership.\n{{toc limit|3}}\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Toronto Blue Jays}}\n\n===Expansion team===\nThe Blue Jays were approved as part of the [[1977 Major League Baseball expansion]] discussions, after Toronto's original plan of getting a Major League Baseball team by luring the Giants from San Francisco fell through; they would be added alongside the Seattle Mariners.

The game is now perhaps best remembered for the minor snowstorm which began just before the game started. Toronto won the snowy affair 9\u20135, led by [[Doug Ault]]'s two [[home run]]s. That win would be one of only 54 of the 1977 season, as the [[1977 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] finished last in the AL East, with a record of 54\u2013107.

In addition, the Blue Jays' first mascot, [[BJ Birdy]], made its debut in 1979.\n\nIn 1980, [[Bobby Mattick]] became manager, succeeding [[Roy Hartsfield]], the Blue Jays' original manager. In Mattick's first season as manager, although they remained at the bottom, [[1980 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto]] almost reached the 70-win mark, finishing with a record of 67\u201395, a 14-win improvement on 1979.

The Blue Jays featured strong pitching and a balanced offence. Tony Fern\u00e1ndez excelled in his first full season, and veteran pitcher [[Doyle Alexander]] led the team with 17 wins, including a division-clinching complete game win. Their mid-season call up of relief pitcher [[Tom Henke]] also proved to be important. They finished 99\u201362 (the franchise record for most wins), two games in front of the [[1985 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]]. The Blue Jays faced the [[1985 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] in the [[1985 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] (ALCS), and took a three games to one lead. However, Kansas City won three consecutive games to win the series 4\u20133, on the way to their first [[1985 World Series|World Series]] championship.

[[Jesse Barfield]] and [[George Bell (outfielder)|George Bell]] led the way with 40 and 31 home runs, respectively, while [[Jim Clancy (baseball)|Jim Clancy]], [[Mark Eichhorn]], and [[Jimmy Key]] tied for the team wins lead with 14 each.\n\nIn 1987, the [[1987 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] held a 3\u00bd-game lead with a week to go in the season, then lost their last seven in a row to finish two games back of the [[1987 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], getting swept on the last weekend by the Tigers. The Blue Jays finished with a 96\u201366 record, second best in the major leagues, but to no avail. However, George Bell (.308 [[batting average (baseball)|AVG]], 47 HR, 134 RBI) was named the AL's [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP), the first Blue Jay to earn that honour.\n\nIn 1988, however, [[1988 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto]] could not duplicate the successes of the previous season. They tied the [[1988 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] for third in the division at 87\u201375, only two games behind the division champion [[1988 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. Still, the season had numerous highlights. First baseman [[Fred McGriff]] hit 34 home runs, and Dave Stieb had back-to-back starts in which he lost a [[no-hitter]] with two out and two strikes in the ninth inning.\n\n====1989\u20131991: Cito Gaston takes charge, two more AL East titles====\n[[File:Cito.jpg|thumb|[[Cito Gaston]] was named as the Blue Jays' manager during the [[1989 Major League Baseball season|1989]] season.]]\nIn 1989, the [[1989 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays']] new [[retractable roof]]ed home, [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]], opened mid-season. It also marked the beginning of an extremely successful five-year period for the team. In May, management fired manager Jimy<!-- This is the correct spelling --> Williams and replaced him with [[Cito Gaston]], the team's hitting instructor. The club had a dismal 12\u201324 record at the time of the firing, but went 77\u201349 under Gaston to win the AL East title by two games, with an 89\u201373 record. On May 28, George Bell's [[walk-off home run]], off of [[1989 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] closer [[Bobby Thigpen]], marked the end of the Exhibition Stadium era. The first game at the new stadium took place on June 5 against the [[1989 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]; the Jays lost 5\u20133. In the [[1989 American League Championship Series|1989 ALCS]], [[Rickey Henderson]] led the [[1989 World Series|World Series]] champion [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] to a 4\u20131 series win.\n\nIn 1990, the [[1990 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] again had a strong season, but finished in second place, two games behind the [[1990 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. Dave Stieb pitched his only no-hitter, beating the [[1990 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] 3\u20130 in front of a less than capacity crowd at [[Cleveland Stadium|Cleveland Municipal Stadium]]. As of 2018, it remains the only no-hitter ever pitched by a Blue Jay. During the offseason, the Blue Jays made one of the two biggest trades in franchise history, sending All-Star shortstop [[Tony Fern\u00e1ndez]] and first baseman [[Fred McGriff]] to the [[San Diego Padres]] in exchange for outfielder [[Joe Carter]] and second baseman [[Roberto Alomar]]. The Jays also obtained centre<!-- Baseball terminology supersedes Canadian English in preference for this article --> fielder [[Devon White (baseball)|Devon White]] from the [[Los Angeles Angels|California Angels]]. These deals, particularly the trade with San Diego, were instrumental in the team's future success.\n\nCarter, Alomar and White would prove to be extremely effective additions, as the [[1991 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] again won the division in 1991, as Carter drove in Alomar for the division-winning run. Once again, however, they fell short in the postseason, losing to the [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]], who were on the way to their second [[1991 World Series|World Series]] victory in five seasons, in the [[1991 American League Championship Series|ALCS]].

To add veteran leadership to their explosive offence, Toronto signed [[Dave Winfield]] to be the team's designated hitter.\n\nThe 1992 regular season went well, as the Jays clinched their second straight AL East crown with a final record of 96\u201366, four games ahead of the [[1992 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]. They also went the entire season without being swept in any series, becoming the first team in 49 years to accomplish the feat.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/1943-schedule-scores.shtml 1943 St. Louis Cardinals] Baseball-Reference.com.

The pivotal game of the series was Game 4, considered by many to be one of the most important games in Blue Jays history: the Blue Jays rallied back from a 6\u20131 deficit after seven innings, capped off by [[Roberto Alomar]]'s huge game-tying two-run homer off A's closer [[Dennis Eckersley]] in the top of the ninth. This paved the way for a 7\u20136 victory in 11 innings, a 3-games-to-1 lead in the series and an eventual 4\u20132 ALCS series win.\n\nThe Blue Jays then faced the [[1992 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1992 World Series|World Series]]. The Braves returned after being beaten by the Twins the previous year. The pivotal game in this series turned out to be Game 2, in which reserve player [[Ed Sprague Jr.|Ed Sprague]] hit a 9th-inning two-run home run off Braves closer [[Jeff Reardon]] to give the Blue Jays a 5\u20134 lead, which would hold up. After winning Game 3 thanks to Candy Maldonado's ninth inning RBI hit and Game 4 due to Jimmy Key's superb 7\u2153 inning pitching effort in which he retired 15 straight batters (five innings), the Jays could not win the Series on home turf as the Braves struck back with a 7\u20132 win in Game 5. Game 6 in Atlanta, with the Blue Jays leading 3 games to 2, was a very close game. Toronto was one strike away from winning in the bottom of the 9th inning, 2\u20131,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ATL/ATL199210240.shtml |title=October 24, 1992 World Series Game 6 at Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium Play by Play and Box Score |website=Baseball-Reference.com |date=October 24, 1992 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref> but [[Otis Nixon]] singled in the tying run off the Blue Jays' closer [[Tom Henke]]. It was the first run the Toronto bullpen had given up in the series. The game was decided in the 11th inning, when [[Dave Winfield]] doubled down the left-field line, driving in two runs. The Braves would again come within one run in the bottom of the 11th, but Jays reliever [[Mike Timlin]] fielded [[Otis Nixon]]'s bunt, throwing to Joe Carter at first base for the final out. The Blue Jays became the first team based outside of the United States to win the World Series. [[Pat Borders]], the Jays' catcher, was the unlikely player who was named MVP after hitting .450 with one home run in the World Series. Oddly, Morris was acquired in large part for his reputation as a clutch postseason pitcher, but he went 0\u20133 in the playoffs. Morris, however, pitched well in the regular season, becoming the Blue Jays' first 20-game winner, with a record of 21\u20136 and an [[earned run average|ERA]] of 4.04.\n\n* Team record 1992: 96 wins\u201366 losses, W%- 0.593\n\n=====1993: Back-to-back champs=====\n{{main|1993 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\n[[File:Blue Jays Win the 1993 World Series.jpg|thumb|Fireworks at the [[Rogers Centre|Skydome]] following the Blue Jays' victory in the [[1993 World Series]].]]\nAfter the 1992 season, the Blue Jays let World Series hero Dave Winfield and longtime closer Tom Henke go, but signed two key free agents: designated hitter [[Paul Molitor]] from the Milwaukee Brewers and perennial playoff success [[Dave Stewart (baseball)|Dave Stewart]] from the Oakland Athletics.\n\nIn 1993, the Blue Jays had seven All-Stars: outfielders Devon White and Joe Carter, infielders [[John Olerud]] and Roberto Alomar, designated hitter Molitor, plus starting pitcher [[Pat Hentgen]], and closer [[Duane Ward]]. In August, the Jays acquired former nemesis [[Rickey Henderson]] from the Athletics. The Blue Jays cruised to a 95\u201367 record, seven games ahead of the [[1993 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], winning their third straight division title. The Jays beat the [[1993 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] four games to two in the [[1993 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], and then the [[1993 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]], four games to two, for their second straight [[1993 World Series|World Series]] victory. The World Series featured several exciting games, including Game 4, played under a slight rain, in which the Blue Jays came back from a 14\u20139 deficit to win 15\u201314 and take a 3 games to 1 lead in the series. It remains the highest scoring game in World Series history. Game 6 in Toronto saw the Blue Jays lead 5\u20131, but give up 5 runs in the 7th inning to trail 6\u20135. In the bottom of the 9th inning, Joe Carter hit a one-out, three-run walk-off home run to clinch the series off of Phillies closer [[Mitch Williams]]. Only the second World Series\u2013winning walk-off home run in the history of Major League Baseball (following [[Bill Mazeroski]]'s in Game 7 in [[1960 World Series|1960]]), Carter's hit differed from the first in that Toronto, while not facing elimination, was trailing in the bottom of the 9th. The home run is also memorable for late Blue Jays broadcaster [[Tom Cheek]]'s call:\n\n{{Quote box\n|width=98%\n|align=center\n|quote=A swing, and a belt! Left field! Way back! Blue Jays win it!

It was their first losing season since 1982. [[Joe Carter]], [[Paul Molitor]] and [[John Olerud]] enjoyed good years at the plate, but the pitching fell off. [[Juan Guzm\u00e1n (baseball)|Juan Guzm\u00e1n]] slumped considerably from his first three years (40\u201311, 3.28 ERA), finishing 1994 at 12\u201311 with a 5.68 ERA. Three young players, [[Alex Gonzalez (shortstop, born 1973)|Alex Gonzalez]], [[Carlos Delgado]] and [[Shawn Green]], did show much promise for the future. At the time of the strike, their fellow Canadian cousins, the [[1994 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]], had the best record in the majors, leading some to consider the possibility of a Canadian three-peat in 1994.\n\nOn October 31, 1994, Gillick, the longtime Blue Jays general manager, resigned and handed the reins of the team to assistant general manager and Toronto native [[Gord Ash]],<ref name=\"history\"/> who would lead the team in its most tumultuous era yet.\n\n* Team record 1994: 55 wins\u201360 losses, W%- 0.478, 16 games behind division leader\n\n===1995\u20132001: The Gord Ash era===\n\n====1995\u20132000====\nIn the 1995 season, the [[1995 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] proved that they had lost their contending swagger of the past 12 years. Although they had most of the same cast of the World Series teams, the Blue Jays freefell to a dismal 56\u201388 record, last place in the AL East, 30 games behind the [[1995 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. That year, team owner Labatt Breweries was bought by [[Belgium|Belgian]]-based brewer [[Interbrew]], making the Blue Jays the second major league team owned by interests outside of North America, after their expansion cousins, the [[Seattle Mariners]] (who were then owned by [[Nintendo]]).\n\n1996 was another mediocre year for the [[1996 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]], despite [[Pat Hentgen]]'s [[Cy Young Award]] (20\u201310, 3.22 ERA). [[Ed Sprague Jr.|Ed Sprague]] had a career year, hitting 36 home runs and driving in 101 runs. However, the team's 74 wins did put them in 4th place, improving over a last place finish in 1995.\n\nThe [[1997 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] started 1997 with high hopes. Not only did the Jays drastically change their uniforms, they signed former [[Boston Red Sox]] ace [[Roger Clemens]] to a $24.75 million contract. Clemens had one of the best pitching seasons ever as he won the pitcher's [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]], leading the American League with a record of 21\u20137, a 2.05 ERA, and 292 strikeouts. This was not enough to lead the Blue Jays to the postseason, however, as they finished in last place for the second time in three years with a record of 76\u201386. [[Cito Gaston]], the longtime manager who led the team to four division titles and two World Series crowns, was fired five games before the end of the season. The season did provide a unique experience for its fans with the advent of [[Interleague play]], when the Blue Jays faced their Canadian rival, the [[1997 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]], for the first official games between the two teams.\nBefore the start of the 1998 season, the [[1998 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] acquired closer [[Randy Myers]] and slugger [[Jose Canseco]]. Gaston was replaced with former Blue Jay [[Tim Johnson (baseball)|Tim Johnson]], a relative unknown as a manager. Despite mediocre hitting, strong pitching led by Clemens' second straight pitching Triple Crown (20\u20136, 2.65 ERA, 271 strikeouts) sparked the Blue Jays to an 88\u201374 record\u2014their first winning season since 1993. However, this was only good enough to finish a distant third, 26 games behind the [[1998 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], who posted one of the greatest records in all of baseball history at 114\u201348. They were, however, in contention for the wildcard spot until the final week.\n\nBefore the 1999 season, the Blue Jays traded Clemens to the Yankees for starting pitcher [[David Wells]], second baseman [[Homer Bush]] and relief pitcher [[Graeme Lloyd]]. They also fired manager Tim Johnson during spring training after he lied about several things (including killing people in the [[Vietnam War]]) to motivate his players. The Blue Jays had initially been willing to stand by Johnson. A blizzard of questions about his credibility during spring training, however, led Ash to fire him less than a month before opening day. Johnson was replaced with [[Jim Fregosi]], who managed the Phillies when they lost to the Blue Jays in the [[1993 World Series]]. The offence picked up somewhat in 1999, but the pitching suffered without Clemens, as the [[1999 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] finished at 84\u201378, in third place. After the 1999 season, the Blue Jays' original mascot for 20 years, BJ Birdy, was replaced by a duo named [[Toronto Blue Jays mascots|Ace and Diamond]].\n\nOn November 8, 1999, Toronto traded star outfielder [[Shawn Green]] to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for left-handed relief pitcher [[Pedro Borb\u00f3n Jr.|Pedro Borb\u00f3n]] and right-fielder [[Ra\u00fal Mondes\u00ed]]. Green had told the Jays that he would not be re-signing when his contract was up at the end of the year (he wished to play closer to his home in Southern California).\n\n2000 proved to be a similar season, as the [[2000 Toronto Blue Jays season|Jays]] had an 83\u201379 record, well out of the wild card race but only a slim 4\u00bd games back of the three-time defending World Series champion [[2000 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in the AL East, the first time since 1993 they had contended for the division. [[Carlos Delgado]] had a stellar year, hitting .344 with 41 home runs, 57 doubles, 137 RBI, 123 walks and 115 runs. In addition, six other players hit 20 or more home runs, an outstanding feat.\n\n====2000\u20132001====\n[[File:BobFile FenwayPark 2001 3.jpg|thumb|[[Bob File]] pitching for the Blue Jays at [[Fenway Park]] during the [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001]] season.]]\nOn September 1, 2000, [[Rogers Communications]] Inc. purchased 80% of the baseball club for $160 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ted-rogers-buys-the-blue-jays-1.253587|title=Ted Rogers buys The Blue Jays\n|date=September 1, 2000|accessdate=December 28, 2013|work=[[CBC News]]}}</ref> with Interbrew (later [[InBev]]) maintaining 20% interest and the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] relinquishing its 10% share.

[[Buck Martinez]], a former catcher and broadcast announcer for the Blue Jays, took over as manager before the season began. The [[2001 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] had a disappointing season, as the team fell back under .500, finishing at 80\u201382, with mediocre pitching and hitting. Delgado led the team again with 39 home runs and 102 RBI. After the 2001 season ended, the Blue Jays fired Gord Ash, ending a seven-year tenure as general manager.\n\n[[J. P. Ricciardi]], then director of player development under [[Oakland Athletics]] general manager [[Billy Beane]], was named the Blue Jays' General Manager and was expected to slash the payroll immediately, to stem the tide of red ink. During the off-season, the team traded or let go several popular players, including [[Alex Gonzalez (shortstop, born 1973)|Alex Gonzalez]], [[Paul Quantrill]], [[Brad Fullmer]] and [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Billy Koch]] to let talented youngsters such as [[Eric Hinske]] and [[Felipe L\u00f3pez (baseball)|Felipe L\u00f3pez]] get a chance to develop into major leaguers.\n\n===2002\u20132009: The J.

[[Buck Martinez]] was fired about a third of the way through the season, with a 20\u201333 record. He was replaced by third base coach [[Carlos Tosca]], an experienced minor league manager. They went 58\u201351 under Tosca to finish the season 78\u201384. [[Roy Halladay]] was relied on as the team's ace and rose to the challenge of being the team's top pitcher, finishing the season with a 19\u20137 record and 2.93 ERA. The hitters were led once again by [[Carlos Delgado]]. Promising young players were assigned to key roles; starting third baseman [[Eric Hinske]] won the Rookie of the Year Award at the season's conclusion, and 23-year-old centre fielder [[Vernon Wells]] had his first 100 RBI season.\n\n* Team record 2002: 78 wins\u201384 losses, W%- 0.481, 25.5 games behind division leader, third in division\n\n====2003 season====\n{{Main|2003 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\nThe 2003 season was a surprise to both team management and baseball analysts. After a poor April, the team had its most successful month ever in May. Carlos Delgado led the majors in RBI, followed closely by Wells. Despite their hitting successes, poor pitching continued to plague the team. Halladay was an exception, winning his first [[Cy Young Award]], going 22\u20137, with a 3.25 ERA. In July, [[Shannon Stewart (baseball)|Shannon Stewart]] was traded to the [[Minnesota Twins]] for [[Bobby Kielty]], another outfielder with a much lower batting average than Stewart's. Although the Jays finished in third place in their division, Delgado was second in the voting for the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP Award]]. In the off-season, Kielty was traded to the [[Oakland Athletics]] for starter [[Ted Lilly]].\n\n* Team record 2003: 86 wins\u201376 losses, W%- 0.531, 15 games behind division leader, third in division\n\n====2004 season====\n{{Main|2004 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\nThe 2004 season was a disappointing year for the Blue Jays right from the beginning. They started the season 0\u20138 at SkyDome and never started a lengthy winning streak. Much of that was due to injuries to All-Stars Carlos Delgado, Vernon Wells and Roy Halladay among others. Although the additions of starting pitchers Ted Lilly and [[Miguel Batista]] and reliever [[Justin Speier]] were relatively successful, veteran [[Pat Hentgen]] faltered throughout the season and retired on July 24. Rookies and minor league callups [[Dave Bush|David Bush]], [[Jason Frasor]], [[Josh Towers]] and others filled the void in the rotation and the bullpen; however, inconsistent performances were evident. With the team struggling in last place and mired in a five-game losing streak, manager [[Carlos Tosca]] was fired on August 8, 2004, and was replaced by first base coach [[John Gibbons]]. Long-time first baseman Carlos Delgado became a free agent in the off-season. Nevertheless, prospects [[Russ Adams]], [[Gabe Gross]], and [[Alex R\u00edos]] provided excitement for the fans. Rookie pitchers David Bush, [[Gustavo Chac\u00edn]] and Jason Frasor also showed promise for the club's future.

The Blue Jays had a good start to the 2005 season. They led the AL East from early to mid-April and held their record around .500 until late August. The Jays were hit with the injury bug when third baseman [[Corey Koskie]] broke his finger, taking him out of the line-up, but the club was pleasantly surprised with the performance of rookie call-up [[Aaron Hill (baseball)|Aaron Hill]] in his stead. On July 8, just prior to the All-Star break, Blue Jays ace Roy Halladay was struck on the shin by a line drive, resulting in a fractured leg. Though Halladay's injury was hoped to be minor, the recovery process was met with constant delays, and eventually, he was out for the rest of the season. Prior to his injury, the Blue Jays were in serious wild card contention, but soon fell out of the playoff race. The team received glimpses of the future from September call-ups [[Guillermo Quir\u00f3z]], [[John-Ford Griffin]], and [[Shaun Marcum]]. Marcum made himself noteworthy by posting an ERA of 0.00 over five relief appearances and eight innings in September. Josh Towers also stepped up, showing largely unseen potential by going 7\u20135 with a 2.91 ERA in the second half of the season.\n\n* Team record 2005: 80 wins\u201382 losses, W%- 0.494, 15 games behind division leader, third in division\n\n====2006 season====\n{{Main|2006 Toronto Blue Jays season}}\n\nIn 2006, the team experienced its most successful season in years.

This marked the first time that the Jays had finished above third place in their division since their World Championship season of 1993, and with the most wins since the 1998 season.

On June 20, following a five-game losing streak and with the Jays in last place in the AL East, management fired [[John Gibbons]] and several members of his coaching staff, and re-hired [[Cito Gaston]].

Prior to 2018, [[Jerry Howarth]], Cheek's longtime broadcasting partner, was the lead play-by-play announcer, with [[Mike Wilner]] as the secondary play-by-play announcer. During the 2007 to 2012 seasons, former Blue Jays catcher [[Alan Ashby]] was the colour commentator. Former Blue Jays pitcher [[Jack Morris]] served as the [[Color commentator|colour commentator]] during the 2013 season, after which he was replaced by former Montreal Expos catcher [[Joe Siddall]] since the 2014 season.\n\nFormer Blue Jays pitcher [[Dirk Hayhurst]] filled in for Morris for some games during the 2013 season.\n\nAnother former catcher for the Blue Jays, [[Gregg Zaun]], has served as the occasional colour commentator from the [[2011 Toronto Blue Jays season|2011 season]] until the end of the [[2017 Toronto Blue Jays season|2017 season]] when he was terminated amid accusations of improper conduct from several female employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/sportsnet-terminates-zaun-allegations-inappropriate-behaviour/|title=Sportsnet terminates Gregg Zaun after allegations of inappropriate behaviour|work=[[Sportsnet]]|date=November 30, 2017|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Howarth's retirement in the 2017 season, [[Ben Wagner]] was hired as the primary radio play-by-play announcer, splitting said duties with [[Dan Shulman]] and Mike Wilner.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays have the largest geographical home market in all of baseball, encompassing all of Canada.  Despite this, the number of radio stations that broadcast games is actually quite small.

[[Toronto Raptors]] play-by-play announcer [[Matt Devlin (sportscaster)|Matt Devlin]] has also filled in for Martinez in a select number of games. In previous years, the colour analyst role rotated between [[Pat Tabler]], [[Rance Mulliniks]], [[Darrin Fletcher]], and since the 2011 season, Gregg Zaun. Sportsnet became the team's primary carrier soon after it launched in the late 1990s, and became the team's exclusive broadcaster in 2010.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100518073220/http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20100513&content_id=10022884&vkey=pr_tor&fext=.jsp&c_id=tor Blue Jays Now Exclusively on Sportsnet], Blue Jays press release, May 13, 2010</ref> As of August 2010, [[Sportsnet One]] also broadcasts Blue Jays games (often in case of scheduling conflicts with the main Sportsnet channels).

Created by [[cartoonist]]s [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[#Golden Age|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover date]]d March 1941) from [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a [[American patriotism|patriotic]] [[supersoldier]] who often fought the [[Axis powers]] of [[World War II]] and was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the ''Captain America'' comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.\n\nThe character wears a costume bearing an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]], and he utilizes a [[Captain America's shield|nearly indestructible shield]] that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the [[alter ego]] of '''Steve Rogers''', a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the [[United States]] government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in [[Cryopreservation|suspended animation]] until he was revived in modern times. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly respected figure in his community, which includes becoming the long-time leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n\nCaptain America was the first Marvel Comics character to appear in media outside comics with the release of the 1944 [[Serial (film)|movie serial]], ''[[Captain America (serial)|Captain America]]''. Since then, the character has been featured in [[Captain America in other media|other films and television series]]. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), the [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|character]] is portrayed by [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]].\n\nCaptain America was ranked sixth on [[IGN]]'s \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time\" in 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/6|title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes|date= 2011|website=IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150630173526/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/6|archivedate= June 30, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate= July 9, 2015}}</ref> second in their list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\" in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/2|date= April 30, 2012 |title= The Top 50 Avengers|website=IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151129171205/http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/2|archivedate= November 29, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> and second in their \"Top 25 best Marvel superheroes\" list in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.uk.ign.com/articles/2014/09/10/top-25-best-marvel-superheroes|title=Top 25 Best Marvel Superheroes|first1= Joshua|last1= Yehl|first2= Jeff|last2= Lake|date= September 10, 2014|website= IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141031191046/http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/09/10/top-25-best-marvel-superheroes|archivedate= October 31, 2014|url-status=live|accessdate= October 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Publication history==\n{{further|List of Captain America titles}}\n\n===Creation===\nIn 1940, writer Joe Simon conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume.<ref>1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program, cover</ref> \"I wrote the name 'Super American' at the bottom of the page,\" Simon said in his autobiography, and then decided:\n\n{{quote|No, it didn't work.

Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character's stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist [[Jack Kirby]], could handle the workload alone:\n\n{{quote|I didn't have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue&nbsp; ... There were two young artists from [[Connecticut]] that had made a strong impression on me. [[Al Avison]] and [[Al Gabriele]] often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other. Actually, their work was not too far from [that of] Kirby's. If they worked on it, and if one inker tied the three styles together, I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform. The two Als were eager to join in on the new ''Captain America'' book, but Jack Kirby was visibly upset. \"You're still number one, Jack,\" I assured him. \"It's just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue.\"\n\n\"I'll make the deadline,\" Jack promised. \"I'll pencil it [all] myself and make the deadline.\" I hadn't expected this kind of reaction&nbsp; ... but I acceded to Kirby's wishes and, it turned out, was lucky that I did. There might have been two Als, but there was only one Jack Kirby ... I wrote the first ''Captain America'' book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards, with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds. Kirby did his thing, building the muscular anatomy, adding ideas and popping up the action as only he could. Then he tightened up the penciled drawings, adding detailed backgrounds, faces and figures.\"<ref name=joesimonp50 />}}\n[[File:1974ComicArtCon book.jpg|thumb|left|1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program featuring Simon's original sketch of Captain America]]\nAl Lieberman would ink that first issue, which was lettered by Simon and Kirby's regular letterer, Howard Ferguson.<ref>Simon, p. 51.</ref>\n\nSimon said Captain America was a consciously political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of [[Nazi Germany]] in the years leading up to the United States' involvement in [[World War II]] and felt war was inevitable: \"The opponents to the war were all quite well organized.

His skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or even cause a [[boomerang]]-like return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind.

To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.\n\nCaptain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle, modified by the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weapons laboratory, as well as a custom-built battle van, constructed by the [[Wakanda]] Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes (red, white and blue), and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it.\n\n==Antagonists==\n{{Main|List of Captain America enemies}}\nCaptain America has faced numerous foes in over 70 years of published adventures. Many of his recurring foes embody ideologies contrary to the American values that Captain America is shown to strive for and believes in. Some examples of these opposing values are Nazism ([[Red Skull]], [[Baron Zemo]]), [[neo-Nazism]] ([[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]), technocratic fascism ([[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], [[Arnim Zola]]), Communism ([[Aleksander Lukin]]), amoral capitalism ([[Roxxon Energy Corporation]]), anti-patriotism ([[Flag Smasher]]) and international and domestic terrorism ([[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]]).\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Main|Alternative versions of Captain America}}\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America in other media}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{cite web | last=Gladstone | first=Brooke | url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/129271-death-to-america/#transcript | title= Death to America | publisher=Transcript and streaming audio; [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Joe Simon]] interviewed|work=[[On the Media]]|date=March 9, 2007 | accessdate=July 27, 2007}}\n*{{cite web | last=Powell | first=Matt | url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003800596.cfm | work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | date=March 7, 2007 | title=Captain America Remembered | accessdate=July 27, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309130111/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003800596.cfm|archivedate=March 9, 2007}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140502000500/http://captainamericalibrary.com/ Captain America Library] (fan site).

Created by [[cartoonist]]s [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[#Golden Age|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover date]]d March 1941) from [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a [[American patriotism|patriotic]] [[supersoldier]] who often fought the [[Axis powers]] of [[World War II]] and was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the ''Captain America'' comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.\n\nThe character wears a costume bearing an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]], and he utilizes a [[Captain America's shield|nearly indestructible shield]] that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the [[alter ego]] of '''Steve Rogers''', a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the [[United States]] government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in [[Cryopreservation|suspended animation]] until he was revived in modern times.

[[Al Avison]] and [[Al Gabriele]] often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other. Actually, their work was not too far from [that of] Kirby's. If they worked on it, and if one inker tied the three styles together, I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform. The two Als were eager to join in on the new ''Captain America'' book, but Jack Kirby was visibly upset. \"You're still number one, Jack,\" I assured him. \"It's just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue.\"\n\n\"I'll make the deadline,\" Jack promised. \"I'll pencil it [all] myself and make the deadline.\" I hadn't expected this kind of reaction&nbsp; ... but I acceded to Kirby's wishes and, it turned out, was lucky that I did. There might have been two Als, but there was only one Jack Kirby ... I wrote the first ''Captain America'' book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards, with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds. Kirby did his thing, building the muscular anatomy, adding ideas and popping up the action as only he could.

As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.\n\nCaptain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle, modified by the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weapons laboratory, as well as a custom-built battle van, constructed by the [[Wakanda]] Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes (red, white and blue), and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it.\n\n==Antagonists==\n{{Main|List of Captain America enemies}}\nCaptain America has faced numerous foes in over 70 years of published adventures.

As the grandson of [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough|7th Duke of Marlborough]], he bore the [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] coat of arms of the [[Spencer family|Spencer]] and Churchill families. Paul Courtenay observes that \"It would be normal in these circumstances for the paternal arms (Spencer) to take precedence over the maternal (Churchill), but because the Marlborough dukedom was senior to the Sunderland earldom, the procedure was reversed in this case.\"  In 1817 an [[augmentation of honour]] was granted commemorating the [[Battle of Blenheim|victory of Blenheim]] by the 1st Duke.<ref name=\"Courtenay \">Paul Courtenay, The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill [http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/reference/armorial-bearings-of-wsc The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718222952/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/reference/armorial-bearings-of-wsc |date=18 July 2013 }} (accessed 20 July 2013).</ref>\n\nAs Churchill's father, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], was the surviving second son of the 7th Duke of Marlborough, his arms should have been differenced, by strict heraldic rules, with a [[Cadency|mark of cadency]].  Traditionally, this would have been a heraldic crescent.  Those differenced arms would have been inherited by Winston Churchill.  This never seems to have been used by Lord Randolph or Winston.  As arms are used to differentiate two bearers, there doesn't seem to have been any confusion between Churchill's arms as a gentleman with many decorations and later Knight of the Garter, those of his brother as a plain gentleman, and his cousin, the Duke of Marlborough, which were adorned with the insignia of a duke.  As a Knight of the Garter, Churchill was also entitled to supporters in his achievement.  But, he never seems to have got around to applying for them.<ref>Paul Courtenay, The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill [https://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/reference/the-armorial-bearings-of-sir-winston-churchill/ The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718222952/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/reference/armorial-bearings-of-wsc |date=18 July 2013 }} (accessed 02 February 2018).</ref>\n\nThe resulting heraldic achievement is: ''quarterly 1st and 4th, Sable a lion rampant Argent on a canton of the second a cross Gules ([[Duke of Marlborough (title)#Coats of arms|Churchill]]); 2nd and 3rd, quarterly Argent and Gules, in the second and third quarters a fret Or, over all on a bend Sable three escallops of the first ([[Spencer family#Coat of arms|Spencer]]); in chief, on an escutcheon Argent a cross Gules surmounted by an inescutcheon Azure charged with three [[fleurs-de-lys]] Or''.<ref name=\"Courtenay\"/>\n\nWhen he became a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] in 1953, his arms were encircled by the garter of the order, and at the same time the [[Helmet (heraldry)|helms]] were made open, which is the mark of a knight.

By custom, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom#Retirement honours|prime ministers retiring]] from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]] were usually offered [[earldom]]s, so a dukedom was a sign of special honour. One title that was considered was ''Duke of London'', a city whose name had never been used in a peerage title. Churchill had represented divisions of three different counties in Parliament, and his home, [[Chartwell]], was in a fourth, so the city in which he had spent most of his time during fifty years in politics was seen as a suitable choice.Churchill considered accepting the offer of a dukedom but eventually declined it; the lifestyle of a duke would have been expensive, and accepting any peerage might have cut short a renewed career in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Commons]] for his son [[Randolph Churchill|Randolph]] and in due course might also prevent one for his grandson [[Winston Churchill (1940\u20132010)|Winston]].<ref name=\"ramsden2002\">{{cite book | title=Man of the Century: Winston Churchill and His Legend Since 1945 | publisher=Columbia University Press | author=Ramsden, John | year=2002 | url=https://archive.org/details/manofcenturywins00rams | url-access=registration | pages=[https://archive.org/details/manofcenturywins00rams/page/113 113], 597 | isbn=9780231131063}}</ref> (At the time there was no procedure for disclaiming a title; the procedure was first established by the [[Peerage Act 1963]].

As the grandson of [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough|7th Duke of Marlborough]], he bore the [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] coat of arms of the [[Spencer family|Spencer]] and Churchill families. Paul Courtenay observes that \"It would be normal in these circumstances for the paternal arms (Spencer) to take precedence over the maternal (Churchill), but because the Marlborough dukedom was senior to the Sunderland earldom, the procedure was reversed in this case.\"  In 1817 an [[augmentation of honour]] was granted commemorating the [[Battle of Blenheim|victory of Blenheim]] by the 1st Duke.<ref name=\"Courtenay \">Paul Courtenay, The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill [http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/reference/armorial-bearings-of-wsc The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718222952/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/reference/armorial-bearings-of-wsc |date=18 July 2013 }} (accessed 20 July 2013).</ref>\n\nAs Churchill's father, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], was the surviving second son of the 7th Duke of Marlborough, his arms should have been differenced, by strict heraldic rules, with a [[Cadency|mark of cadency]].

As arms are used to differentiate two bearers, there doesn't seem to have been any confusion between Churchill's arms as a gentleman with many decorations and later Knight of the Garter, those of his brother as a plain gentleman, and his cousin, the Duke of Marlborough, which were adorned with the insignia of a duke.  As a Knight of the Garter, Churchill was also entitled to supporters in his achievement.
