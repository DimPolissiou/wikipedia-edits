He uses case examples that fit the [[archetype]] of four basic human desires, demonstrating how each of these [[botany|botanical]] species are selectively grown, bred, and [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]]. The apple reflects the desire for sweetness, the tulip for beauty, marijuana for intoxication, and the potato for control. \n\nThroughout the book, Pollan explores the narrative of his own experience with each of the plants, which he then intertwines with a well-researched exploration into their social history. Each section presents a unique element of human domestication, or the \"human bumblebee\" as Pollan calls it. These range from the true story of [[Johnny Appleseed]] to Pollan's first-hand research with sophisticated marijuana [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] in [[Amsterdam]], to the alarming and [[paradigm]]-shifting possibilities of genetically engineered potatoes.\n\n===''The Omnivore's Dilemma''===\nIn ''[[The Omnivore's Dilemma]]'', Pollan describes four basic ways that human societies have obtained food: the current industrial system, the big organic operation, the local self-sufficient farm, and the [[hunter-gatherer]]. Pollan follows each of these processes\u2014from a group of plants [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] calories through a series of intermediate stages, ultimately into a meal. Along the way, he suggests that there is a fundamental tension between the logic of nature and the logic of human industry, that the way we eat represents our most profound engagement with the natural world, and that industrial eating obscures crucially important ecological relationships and connections. On December 10, 2006, ''[[The New York Times]]'' named ''The Omnivore's Dilemma'' one of the five best nonfiction books of the year. On May 8, 2007, the [[James Beard Foundation]] named ''The Omnivore's Dilemma'' its 2007 winner for the best food writing. It was the book of focus for the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s Reading Project in 2007, and the book of choice for [[Washington State University]]'s Common Reading Program in 2009\u201310.\n\n[[File:Michael Pollan.jpg|thumb|left|Michael Pollan speaks to the [[Marin Academy]] community.]]\n\nPollan's discussion of the industrial food chain is in large part a critique of modern [[agribusiness]]. According to the book, agribusiness has lost touch with the natural cycles of farming, wherein livestock and crops intertwine in mutually beneficial circles. Pollan's critique of modern agribusiness focuses on what he describes as the overuse of corn for purposes ranging from fattening [[cattle]] to massive production of [[corn oil]], [[high-fructose corn syrup]], and other corn derivatives. He describes what he sees as the inefficiencies and other drawbacks of [[factory farming]] and gives his assessment of [[organic food]] production and what it's like to hunt and gather food. He blames those who set the rules (e.g., politicians in Washington, D.C., bureaucrats at the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], [[Wall Street]] capitalists, and agricultural [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] like [[Archer Daniels Midland]]) of what he calls a destructive and precarious agricultural system that has wrought havoc upon the diet, nutrition, and well-being of Americans. Pollan finds hope in [[Joel Salatin]]'s [[Polyface Farm]] in Virginia, which he sees as a model of [[sustainability]] in commercial farming. Pollan appears in the [[documentary film]] ''[[King Corn (film)|King Corn]]'' (2007).\n{{clear}}\n\n===''In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto''===\n[[File:Michael Pollan at TED.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pollan speaking at [[TED (conference)|TED]] in 2007]]\nPollan's book ''[[In Defense of Food]]: An Eater's Manifesto'', released on January 1, 2008, explores the relationship with what he terms ''[[nutritionism]]'' and the Western diet, with a focus on late 20th century food advice given by the science community. Pollan holds that consumption of fat and dietary cholesterol does not lead to a higher rate of coronary disease, and that the reductive analysis of food into nutrient components is a mistake. \n\nThroughout the book, Pollan questions the view that the point of eating is to promote health, pointing out that this attitude is not universal and that cultures that perceive food as having purposes of pleasure, identity, and sociality may end up with better health. He explains this seeming paradox by vetting, and then validating, the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western framework through which we intellectualize the value of food is more a religious and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research. \n\nPollan spends the rest of his book explicating his first three phrases: \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have recognized as food.\n===''Food Rules: An Eater's Manual''===\nIn 2009, ''[[Food Rules: An Eater's Manual]]'' was published. This short work is a condensed version of his previous efforts, intended to provide a simple framework for a healthy and [[sustainable diet]]. It is divided into three sections, further explicating Pollan's principles of \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" It includes his rules (''i.e.,'' \"let others sample your food\" and \"the whiter the bread, the sooner you'll be dead\").\n\n===''Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation''===\nIn ''[[Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation]]'', published in 2013, Pollan explores the methods by which cooks mediate \"between nature and culture.\" The book is organized into four sections corresponding to the [[classical element]]s of Fire (cooking with heat), Water (braising and boiling with pots), Air (breadmaking), and Earth (fermenting). The book also features [[Samin Nosrat]], who later became known for the bestselling cookbook ''Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat'', and as \"the chef who taught Michael Pollan how to cook.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2017/04/samin-nosrat-salt-fat-acid-heat-soup-chez-panisse/|title=This simple advice completely changed the way I eat|work=Mother Jones|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===''How to Change Your Mind''===\nIn 2018, Pollan wrote ''[[How to Change Your Mind]],'' a book about the history and future of psychedelic drugs. He argues that [[psilocybin]] and [[LSD]] are not drugs that make people crazy, which he calls the biggest misconception people have about psychedelics,<ref name=time>{{cite news |last= OAKLANDER |first=Mandy |date=May 16, 2018 |title=This Will Change Your Mind About Psychedelic Drugs |url=http://time.com/5278036/michael-pollan-psychedelic-drugs/ |work=Time |access-date=May 16, 2018 }}</ref> but rather drugs that can help a person become \"more sane\" by, for example, eliminating a fear of death. While promoting his book on TV, he explained that along with LSD and psilocybin, his research included ingesting [[ayahuasca]] and [[5-MeO-DMT]], and that he experienced a [[Ego death#Psychedelics|dissolution of ego]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBOcWgMD49o Michael Pollan On The Healing Power Of Psychedelics] (Time, posted to YouTube on May 18, 2018)</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzgtJleG3r8&t=2m22s Michael Pollan Tried A Series Of Psychedelic Drugs...

His first book, ''[[Second Nature (book)|Second Nature: A Gardener's Education]]'', was published in 1991. \n\nPollan has contributed to ''Greater Good'', a social psychology magazine published by the [[Greater Good Science Center]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. His article \"Edible Ethics\" discusses the intersection of ethical eating and [[social psychology]].\n\nIn his 1998 book ''[[A Place of My Own]]: The Education of an Amateur Builder'', Pollan methodically traced the design and construction of the out-building where he writes. The 2008 re-release of this book was re-titled ''A Place of My Own: The Architecture of Daydreams.''\n\nPollan wrote and narrated an audiobook, Caffeine: How Caffeine Created the Modern World, for ''[[Audible.com]]''\n\nIn 2014, Pollan wrote the foreword in the healthy eating cookbook ''The Pollan Family Table''. The book is co-authored by his mother, Corky Pollan, and sisters, Lori Pollan, Dana Pollan, and [[Tracy Pollan]].\n\nPollan also co-starred in the documentary, ''[[Food, Inc.]]'' (2008), for which he was also a consultant. In 2010 Pollan was interviewed for the film ''[[Queen of the Sun|Queen of the Sun: What are the bees telling us?]]'', a feature-length documentary about [[honey bees]] and [[colony collapse disorder]].<ref>[http://www.queenofthesun.com/2010/11/michael-pollan-author-omnivores-dilemma/ Michael Pollan].

Engber likened Pollan's \"anti-scientific method\" to the rhetoric used by health gurus who peddle diet scams.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Engber |title=Survival of the Yummiest: Should we buy Michael Pollan's nutritional Darwinism? |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2158736|work=Slate}}</ref>\n\nPollan's work has also been discussed and criticized by [[Jonathan Safran Foer]] in his non-fiction book ''[[Eating Animals]]''.\nFoer criticizes Pollan's argument regarding table-fellowship. According to Foer, Pollan claims that a vegetarian dinner guest causes socially reprimandable inconvenience for the host. Foer responds that in the year 2010 it is easier for hosts to accommodate vegetarians than locavores as hosts will need to do extensive research to find (expensive) non factory-farmed meat.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jonathan Safran Foer Takes on Michael Pollan |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH-ZtLfoqaY |accessdate=May 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nPollan has been accused by [[Jon Entine]], who supports GMOs (genetically modified organisms), of using his influence to promote \"anti-GMO junk science\". A number of scientists and journalists have similarly characterized Pollan's work as biased against GMOs. For example, after Pollan posted a tweet that was critical of a ''[[New York Times]]'' article on GMOs, U.C. Berkeley biologist Michael Eisen posted a tweet calling Pollan's comment \"a new low even in Pollan's 'anti-GMO crusade'\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pointed talk: Michael Pollan and Amy Harmon dissect a GM controversy|url = http://grist.org/food/pointed-talk-michael-pollan-and-amy-harmon-dissect-a-gm-controversy/|website = Grist|access-date = 2016-02-09|language = en-US}}</ref><ref name=je>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2013/10/24/michael-pollan-promotes-denialist-anti-gmo-junk-science-brags-he-manipulates-new-york-times-editors/2/ Michael Pollan Promotes 'Denialist' Anti-GMO Junk Science, Says He Manipulates New York Times' Editors], Jon Entine.

He uses case examples that fit the [[archetype]] of four basic human desires, demonstrating how each of these [[botany|botanical]] species are selectively grown, bred, and [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]]. The apple reflects the desire for sweetness, the tulip for beauty, marijuana for intoxication, and the potato for control. \n\nThroughout the book, Pollan explores the narrative of his own experience with each of the plants, which he then intertwines with a well-researched exploration into their social history. Each section presents a unique element of human domestication, or the \"human bumblebee\" as Pollan calls it. These range from the true story of [[Johnny Appleseed]] to Pollan's first-hand research with sophisticated marijuana [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] in [[Amsterdam]], to the alarming and [[paradigm]]-shifting possibilities of genetically engineered potatoes.\n\n===''The Omnivore's Dilemma''===\nIn ''[[The Omnivore's Dilemma]]'', Pollan describes four basic ways that human societies have obtained food: the current industrial system, the big organic operation, the local self-sufficient farm, and the [[hunter-gatherer]]. Pollan follows each of these processes\u2014from a group of plants [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] calories through a series of intermediate stages, ultimately into a meal. Along the way, he suggests that there is a fundamental tension between the logic of nature and the logic of human industry, that the way we eat represents our most profound engagement with the natural world, and that industrial eating obscures crucially important ecological relationships and connections. On December 10, 2006, ''[[The New York Times]]'' named ''The Omnivore's Dilemma'' one of the five best nonfiction books of the year. On May 8, 2007, the [[James Beard Foundation]] named ''The Omnivore's Dilemma'' its 2007 winner for the best food writing. It was the book of focus for the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s Reading Project in 2007, and the book of choice for [[Washington State University]]'s Common Reading Program in 2009\u201310.\n\n[[File:Michael Pollan.jpg|thumb|left|Michael Pollan speaks to the [[Marin Academy]] community.]]\n\nPollan's discussion of the industrial food chain is in large part a critique of modern [[agribusiness]]. According to the book, agribusiness has lost touch with the natural cycles of farming, wherein livestock and crops intertwine in mutually beneficial circles. Pollan's critique of modern agribusiness focuses on what he describes as the overuse of corn for purposes ranging from fattening [[cattle]] to massive production of [[corn oil]], [[high-fructose corn syrup]], and other corn derivatives. He describes what he sees as the inefficiencies and other drawbacks of [[factory farming]] and gives his assessment of [[organic food]] production and what it's like to hunt and gather food. He blames those who set the rules (e.g., politicians in Washington, D.C., bureaucrats at the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], [[Wall Street]] capitalists, and agricultural [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] like [[Archer Daniels Midland]]) of what he calls a destructive and precarious agricultural system that has wrought havoc upon the diet, nutrition, and well-being of Americans. Pollan finds hope in [[Joel Salatin]]'s [[Polyface Farm]] in Virginia, which he sees as a model of [[sustainability]] in commercial farming. Pollan appears in the [[documentary film]] ''[[King Corn (film)|King Corn]]'' (2007).\n{{clear}}\n\n===''In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto''===\n[[File:Michael Pollan at TED.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pollan speaking at [[TED (conference)|TED]] in 2007]]\nPollan's book ''[[In Defense of Food]]: An Eater's Manifesto'', released on January 1, 2008, explores the relationship with what he terms ''[[nutritionism]]'' and the Western diet, with a focus on late 20th century food advice given by the science community. Pollan holds that consumption of fat and dietary cholesterol does not lead to a higher rate of coronary disease, and that the reductive analysis of food into nutrient components is a mistake. \n\nThroughout the book, Pollan questions the view that the point of eating is to promote health, pointing out that this attitude is not universal and that cultures that perceive food as having purposes of pleasure, identity, and sociality may end up with better health. He explains this seeming paradox by vetting, and then validating, the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western framework through which we intellectualize the value of food is more a religious and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research. \n\nPollan spends the rest of his book explicating his first three phrases: \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have recognized as food.\n===''Food Rules: An Eater's Manual''===\nIn 2009, ''[[Food Rules: An Eater's Manual]]'' was published. This short work is a condensed version of his previous efforts, intended to provide a simple framework for a healthy and [[sustainable diet]]. It is divided into three sections, further explicating Pollan's principles of \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" It includes his rules (''i.e.,'' \"let others sample your food\" and \"the whiter the bread, the sooner you'll be dead\").\n\n===''Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation''===\nIn ''[[Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation]]'', published in 2013, Pollan explores the methods by which cooks mediate \"between nature and culture.\" The book is organized into four sections corresponding to the [[classical element]]s of Fire (cooking with heat), Water (braising and boiling with pots), Air (breadmaking), and Earth (fermenting). The book also features [[Samin Nosrat]], who later became known for the bestselling cookbook ''Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat'', and as \"the chef who taught Michael Pollan how to cook.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2017/04/samin-nosrat-salt-fat-acid-heat-soup-chez-panisse/|title=This simple advice completely changed the way I eat|work=Mother Jones|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===''How to Change Your Mind''===\nIn 2018, Pollan wrote ''[[How to Change Your Mind]],'' a book about the history and future of psychedelic drugs.

His article \"Edible Ethics\" discusses the intersection of ethical eating and [[social psychology]].\n\nIn his 1998 book ''[[A Place of My Own]]: The Education of an Amateur Builder'', Pollan methodically traced the design and construction of the out-building where he writes. The 2008 re-release of this book was re-titled ''A Place of My Own: The Architecture of Daydreams.''\n\nPollan wrote and narrated an audiobook, Caffeine: How Caffeine Created the Modern World, for ''[[Audible.com]]''\n\nIn 2014, Pollan wrote the foreword in the healthy eating cookbook ''The Pollan Family Table''. The book is co-authored by his mother, Corky Pollan, and sisters, Lori Pollan, Dana Pollan, and [[Tracy Pollan]].\n\nPollan also co-starred in the documentary, ''[[Food, Inc.]]'' (2008), for which he was also a consultant.

According to Foer, Pollan claims that a vegetarian dinner guest causes socially reprimandable inconvenience for the host. Foer responds that in the year 2010 it is easier for hosts to accommodate vegetarians than locavores as hosts will need to do extensive research to find (expensive) non factory-farmed meat.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jonathan Safran Foer Takes on Michael Pollan |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH-ZtLfoqaY |accessdate=May 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nPollan has been accused by [[Jon Entine]], who supports GMOs (genetically modified organisms), of using his influence to promote \"anti-GMO junk science\". A number of scientists and journalists have similarly characterized Pollan's work as biased against GMOs. For example, after Pollan posted a tweet that was critical of a ''[[New York Times]]'' article on GMOs, U.C. Berkeley biologist Michael Eisen posted a tweet calling Pollan's comment \"a new low even in Pollan's 'anti-GMO crusade'\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pointed talk: Michael Pollan and Amy Harmon dissect a GM controversy|url = http://grist.org/food/pointed-talk-michael-pollan-and-amy-harmon-dissect-a-gm-controversy/|website = Grist|access-date = 2016-02-09|language = en-US}}</ref><ref name=je>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2013/10/24/michael-pollan-promotes-denialist-anti-gmo-junk-science-brags-he-manipulates-new-york-times-editors/2/ Michael Pollan Promotes 'Denialist' Anti-GMO Junk Science, Says He Manipulates New York Times' Editors], Jon Entine.

The station is owned and operated by [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]] and is licensed to [[Callahan, Florida]].  The station's studios are located on Central Parkway in Jacksonville's Southside section, and the transmitter is in the Arlington section.\n\n==History of the 93.3 frequency==\nIn 1995 WAIA switched from [[Adult album alternative|Triple-A]] to [[modern rock]], becoming \"Planet Radio 93.3\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Vox Jox|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 29, 1995|volume=107|issue=30|page=114}}</ref>\n\n==Station history==\nWJBT has been in its current format since 1992 (when it was at 92.7), playing [[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]] and [[R&B]] music.  It is home to the nationally syndicated [[Doug Banks|Doug Banks Morning Show]] (but has been replaced with [[Steve Harvey]] after its move to 93.3).  Its only other competitor is its own sister station, [[Urban AC]] [[WSOL-FM]]. WJBT was the second Urban radio station to adopt \"The Beat\" branding after [[Los Angeles]]' [[KKLQ (FM)|KKBT]].\n\nWhen it was at 92.7, it served the Jacksonville area, but it did not have enough power to serve the northernmost and westernmost portions of the metro because its frequency was licensed to [[Green Cove Springs, Florida]].  However, it had no effect on the [[Arbitron]] ratings as it is still among the Top 5 (sometimes 10) most listened to stations in the city.\n\nOn November 2, 2007, Clear Channel spun off the 92.7 frequency to a private company (which moved the signal to the Palm Coast area as [[WBHQ]])<ref>[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/110207/bus_214248206.shtml From The Florida Times-Union (November 2, 2007)]</ref> and on the evening of December 25 of that same year, moved the station and its format to the more powerful 93.3 signal (formerly the home of Country outlet WROO).<ref>[http://radioinsight.com/netgnomes/whats-coming-to-933-jacksonville/ From Radioinsight (December 6, 2007)]</ref> The reason for this was to comply with FCC ownership rules, since WJBT was in a waiver status in which Clear Channel was allowed to own six FMs and one AM in the market.

It is home to the nationally syndicated [[Doug Banks|Doug Banks Morning Show]] (but has been replaced with [[Steve Harvey]] after its move to 93.3).  It's only other competitor is its own sister station, [[Urban AC]] [[WSOL-FM]]. WJBT was the second Urban radio station to adopt \"The Beat\" branding after [[Los Angeles]]' [[KKLQ (FM)|KKBT]].\n\nWhen it was at 92.7, it served the Jacksonville area, but it did not have enough power to serve the northernmost and westernmost portions of the metro because its frequency was licensed to [[Green Cove Springs, Florida]].

The album released on September 15, 2010 in [[Norwegia]] by ''HWT Records'' and it released in [[United Kingdom]] and worldwide on March 22, 2011 by ''[[Kscope]]''.<ref name=\"KS\">[http://www.kscopemusic.com/gazpacho/missaatropos/album-info.php Kscope Music - Missa Atropos info page]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn the early days of 2010 a replacement for recently departed drummer Robert R Johansen was found in Lars Erik Asp, just in time for him to get to know the music before the second part of the \"Tick Tock\" tour kicks in. It was planned to again visit 6 countries in the March/April period but due to a plane tragedy in Poland giving rise to a week of mourning the Polish promoter decided to postpone the concerts planned for Poland on 16\u201318 April. The dates were rescheduled for September 2010. On 1 May 2010 the first concert in the U.S.A. took place as part of a prog festival at the Majestic Theater in Gettysburg Pennsylvania. For the later German/Italian festivals and the Polish gigs in September they hired a stand-in guitarist by the name of Micheal Krumins to cover for Jon-Arne following the arrival of his first child and his decision to give priority to his family. Meanwhile, in July 2010 the band announced that they should still go on without Robert Johanson and recording of the new album is almost over and it will be out by the end of the year. they also revealed the name of the album a month after that during a gig.\n<br />During the Tick Tock Tour on September gigs, pre printed copies of the new album Missa Atropos were available to the present audience. And even before the official release of the new album (November 26) it was already number 1 charted at a Dutch prog site in October and November. The new album is intended to be another album in the series of films without pictures that they started back in 2007 with \"Night\". In other words, a concept album intended to give the listener a chance to take some time off from the world.\nIn December 2010, Gazpacho brought the news that they have licensed \"Missa Atropos\" to ''Kscope''<ref name=\"KS\"/> in the UK. They will have the rights to the album worldwide. The new album was accompanied by a 12 gig tour in 5 different countries in January / February 2011.\n\n==Story==\n[[File:Fates tapestry -460755563.jpg|thumb|right|Atropos Alongside of her sisters while their ending a life.]]\nThe story of the album is about [[Atropos]] goddess of [[Moirai|fate]] and [[destiny]] in [[Greek mythology]], one of the [[Moirai]]. The Story goes on when Atropos decided to choose the mechanism of death instead of mortality and ended their life cutting their thread with her special scissor which they call it \"Abhorred Shears\". She wasn't all alone in this, her other two sister; [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]] and [[Clotho]] helped her. Clotho was the youngest of all sisters and Lachesis was the kindest one. But as Atropos was so inevitable and hard she used her power to convince them to help her to destroy mortality.\n<br />They say Atropos was jealous of her sisters because they were deciding for humans' lives. Clotho was responsible for spinning the thread of human life and Lachesis was the apportioner, deciding how much time for life was to be allowed for each person or being.<ref>Hamilton, Edith (1942). ''Mythology'', p. 49. Little, Brown and Company, Boston. {{ISBN|978-0-316-34114-1}}</ref>  She measured the thread of life with her rod. She is also said to choose a person's destiny after a thread was measured. In Greek mythology, it is said that she appears with her sisters within three days of a baby's birth to decide its fate. In between all these Atropos was the only one who should have sat somewhere and watches her youngest sisters doing their jobs, so that's when her jealousy overcame her feelings and made her to choose the mechanism of death, then she would have been a part of this circle to end humans' lives on certain time which Lachesis decides.\n<br /> The album characterizes a person who becomes trapped in a lighthouse after leaving the earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazpachoworld.com/media/discography/ |title=gazpachoworld.com |publisher=gazpachoworld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}</ref> He tries to fight against his destiny, which Atropos and her other two sisters decided for him but he finds out he can't overcome his destiny so he starts writing his \"Will to Live\". And in the end when he's dying, he's saying his last words in \"An Audience\" that he feels Atropos is standing next to him and she's ready to cut his thread of life and finish him. But we find out that this person was in love with Atropos and he was waiting for his time to come, which Atropos comes along then he can see her face and say goodbye to this world. That's when he starts describing beauty of Atropos to his only audience that was watching him dying, which is a \"Snail\" and asking that snail to describe Atropos' beauty to anyone he see.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = Prog Archives\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}\n| rev2 = [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock Prog]]\n| rev2Score = Very Positive\n| rev3 = Dangerdog Music Reviews\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}\n\n}}\nThe album mostly received positive reviews.

The album released on September 15, 2010 in [[Norwegia]] by ''HWT Records'' and it released in [[United Kingdom]] and worldwide on March 22, 2011 by ''[[Kscope]]''.<ref name=\"KS\">[http://www.kscopemusic.com/gazpacho/missaatropos/album-info.php Kscope Music - Missa Atropos info page]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn the early days of 2010 a replacement for recently departed drummer Robert R Johansen was found in Lars Erik Asp, just in time for him to get to know the music before the second part of the \"Tick Tock\" tour kicks in. It was planned to again visit 6 countries in the March/April period but due to a plane tragedy in Poland giving rise to a week of mourning the Polish promoter decided to postpone the concerts planned for Poland on 16\u201318 April. The dates were rescheduled for September 2010. On 1 May 2010 the first concert in the U.S.A. took place as part of a prog festival at the Majestic Theater in Gettysburg Pennsylvania. For the later German/Italian festivals and the Polish gigs in September they hired a stand-in guitarist by the name of Micheal Krumins to cover for Jon-Arne following the arrival of his first child and his decision to give priority to his family. Meanwhile, in July 2010 the band announced that they should still go on without Robert Johanson and recording of the new album is almost over and it will be out by the end of the year. they also revealed the name of the album a month after that during a gig.\n<br />During the Tick Tock Tour on September gigs, pre printed copies of the new album Missa Atropos were available to the present audience. And even before the official release of the new album (November 26) it was already number 1 charted at a Dutch prog site in October and November. The new album is intended to be another album in the series of films without pictures that they started back in 2007 with \"Night\". In other words, a concept album intended to give the listener a chance to take some time off from the world.\nIn December 2010, Gazpacho brought the news that they have licensed \"Missa Atropos\" to ''Kscope''<ref name=\"KS\"/> in the UK. They will have the rights to the album worldwide. The new album was accompanied by a 12 gig tour in 5 different countries in January / February 2011.\n\n==Story==\n[[File:Fates tapestry -460755563.jpg|thumb|right|Atropos Alongside of her sisters while their ending a life.]]\nThe story of the album is about [[Atropos]] goddess of [[Moirai|fate]] and [[destiny]] in [[Greek mythology]], one of the [[Moirai]]. The Story goes on when Atropos decided to choose the mechanism of death instead of mortality and ended their life cutting their thread with her special scissor which they call it \"Abhorred Shears\". She wasn't all alone in this, her other two sister; [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]] and [[Clotho]] helped her. Clotho was the youngest of all sisters and Lachesis was the kindest one. But as Atropos was so inevitable and hard she used her power to convince them to help her to destroy mortality.\n<br />They say Atropos was jealous of her sisters because they were deciding for humans' lives. Clotho was responsible for spinning the thread of human life and Lachesis was the apportioner, deciding how much time for life was to be allowed for each person or being.<ref>Hamilton, Edith (1942). ''Mythology'', p. 49. Little, Brown and Company, Boston. {{ISBN|978-0-316-34114-1}}</ref>  She measured the thread of life with her rod. She is also said to choose a person's destiny after a thread was measured. In Greek mythology, it is said that she appears with her sisters within three days of a baby's birth to decide its fate. In between all these Atropos was the only one who should have sat somewhere and watches her youngest sisters doing their jobs, so that's when her jealousy overcame her feelings and made her to choose the mechanism of death, then she would have been a part of this circle to end humans' lives on certain time which Lachesis decides.\n<br /> The album characterizes a person who becomes trapped in a lighthouse after leaving the earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazpachoworld.com/media/discography/ |title=gazpachoworld.com |publisher=gazpachoworld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-02}}</ref> He tries to fight against his destiny, which Atropos and her other two sisters decided for him but he finds out he can't overcome his destiny so he starts writing his \"Will to Live\". And in the end when he's dying, he's saying his last words in \"An Audience\" that he feels Atropos is standing next to him and she's ready to cut his thread of life and finish him. But we find out that this person was in love with Atropos and he was waiting for his time to come, which Atropos comes along then he can see her face and say goodbye to this world. That's when he starts describing beauty of Atropos to his only audience that was watching him dying, which is a \"Snail\" and asking that snail to describe Atropos' beauty to anyone he see.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = Prog Archives\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}\n| rev2 = [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock Prog]]\n| rev2Score = Very Positive\n| rev3 = Dangerdog Music Reviews\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}\n\n}}\nThe album mostly received positive reviews.

From her commissioning until 1941, ''Onondaga'' was stationed at [[Astoria, Oregon]], where she performed important law enforcement duties and rendered much assistance to ships in distress.  Each year she patrolled the annual [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] seal migration to the [[Pribilof Islands]], and she attempted to prevent out of season [[halibut]] fishing.\n\nExecutive Order 8929 of 1 November 1941 transferred the Coast Guard to the [[United States Navy|Navy]].  ''Onondaga'' continued on general [[patrol]] duty, with her base of operations alternating between [[Seattle, Washington]] and [[Ketchikan, Alaska]].  When the [[United States|American]] [[cargo ship|merchantman]] ''Mauna Ala'' went aground on 10 December 1941 on [[Clatsop Beach, Oregon]], during a blackout test, ''Onondaga'' rushed to the scene and rescued thirty-six crewmen.\n\nThen assigned to [[Escort destroyer|escort]] duty in the area of [[Womens Bay, Alaska|Women's Bay]] and [[Kodiak, Alaska]], she was later ordered to escort duty between [[Cape Spencer (Alaska)|Cape Spencer]] and [[Dutch Harbor, Alaska]], as well as [[anti-aircraft]] and escort patrol off Dutch Harbor.\n\nWhen the Navy learned that the [[Japan]]ese planned a thrust into [[Alaska]]n waters as part of their [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] operation, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Chester W. Nimitz|Nimitz]] allocated five [[cruiser]]s, fourteen [[destroyer]]s, six [[submarine]]s, and suitable auxiliaries to counter the opposing forces in the North.  Five years before the outbreak of war the area had been virtually undefended.  But by September 1941, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], Kodiak, and Dutch Harbor had been commissioned as [[Naval Air Station]]s, and both Kodiak and Sitka were able to service submarines.  In mid-1940, the [[United States Army|Army]] had established the [[Alaska Defense Command]], with [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.|Simon Bolivar Buckner]] in command; and the Navy created an [[Alaskan Sector]] under the [[13th Naval District]], appointing [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[Ralph C. Parker]] to the command.\n\nParker's \"Alaskan Navy\" consisted of the gunboat, [[USS Charleston (PG-51)|''Charleston'']], as headquarters and flagship, along with the ''Onondaga'' and three former [[fishing boat]]s (''[[USS YP-72|YP-72]]'', ''[[USS YP-73|YP-73]]'', ''[[USS YP-74|YP-74]]''), converted to patrol craft.\"  [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Charles E.

''Charleston'' alone possessed sonar, or guns larger than three inch.  She, together with the destroyers and cutters, saw constant use as escorts for the [[cargo ship|freighter]]s that brought workers and material to the new bases and airfields, none of which were complete at this time.\n\nToward the end of May, when the Japanese sent one task force towards Midway and another towards the [[Aleutians]], tension quickened throughout the Pacific.  [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Robert A. Theobald]], USN, Commander [[North Pacific Force]], who had been headquartered at Kodiak through the early part of May, put to sea on 1 June in [[USS Nashville (CL-43)|''Nashville'' (CL-43)]] and rendezvoused with his augmented cruiser task force to thwart the Japanese Alaska venture.  However, \"Efforts to meet the enemy,\" writes Willoughby \"were unavailing, and there was no fleet action in Alaskan waters.\"\n\nCutter ''Onondaga'', with [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] S. P. Mehlman, USCG, in command, joined with the other patrol craft (''Charleston'', ''Haida'', ''Cyane'', ''Aurora'', ''Bonham'', and 14 YP patrol vessels) and an old ocean tugboat ([[USS Oriole (AT-136)|''Oriole'']]) formed the Surface Search Group of this Northern Pacific Force.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&context=historical-monographs|first=Milan |last=Vego|authorlink=|title=HM 22 2nd Ed.: Major Fleet-versus-Fleet Operations in the Pacific War, 1941\u20131945|pages=126 |publisher=[[Naval War College]]|date=January 1, 2016|ISBN=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/NHC/NewPDFs/USAAF/United%20States%20Strategic%20Bombing%20Survey/USSBS%20Campaigns%20of%20Pacific%20War.pdf|first=|last=|authorlink=|title=THE CAMPAIGNS of the PACIFIC WAR|pages= 101|publisher=[[United States Navy]] United States Strategic Bombing Survey (PACIFIC) Naval Analysis Division|date=1946|ISBN=|quote=Surface Search Group, Commander Alaskan Sector, (Capt.

Together these forces were to act as [[Picket (military)|pickets]] to signal any Japanese approach.\n\nIn fact, the Japanese sought to capture nothing east of Adak, which is nearly five hundred miles from Dutch Harbor.  No Japanese plan for invading the Alaskan mainland, [[Canada]], or the United States existed.  The Aleutian section of the Midway operation was essentially defensive, although also diversionary.  Its object was to prevent a U.S. invasion of Japan.\n\nAmerican search flights commenced about 28 May, and the 5 cutters, 1 gunboat, and 14 converted fishing craft deployed as pickets on both the Pacific and [[Bering Sea]] approaches to Dutch Harbor.  In view of his expectation of an attack on Dutch Harbor, Admiral Theobald's operating area south of Kodiak was well chosen.  But because he guessed incorrectly, the main body of his cruiser task force was removed from the scene of action.\n\nJapanese [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] planes launched [[Battle of Dutch Harbor|two attacks against Dutch Harbor]] on 3 June, inflicting considerable damage and killing about twenty-five American soldiers and sailors.  Cutter ''Onondaga'' and destroyers [[USS King (DD-242)|''King'']] and [[USS Talbot (APD-7)|''Talbot'']], seaplane tender [[USS Gillis (AVD-12)|''Gillis'']], army transports ''President Fillmore'' and ''Morlen'', and submarine [[USS S-27 (SS-132)|''S-27'']] went to general quarters and made haste to get underway and stand out to sea, but none cleared the [[harbor]] until the attack was over.  One Japanese plane was shot down.\n\nThe next day, another Japanese carrier-based attack was launched against Dutch Harbor.  About eighteen more Americans died in this attack, but at least five Japanese aircraft were shot down.  The Aleutian part of the Midway operation ended in mid-June.  The Japanese occupied [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]], two islands of little except nuisance value.  A phase began on 11 June which witnessed Japanese attempts to hold what they had, while the American forces prepared to blast them out.\n\nEssentially, the Aleutian battle was a contest of air power, as was Midway.  Weather consistently aided the offensive by shrouding ships in protective mist, while sweeping land targets clear.  In May 1943, Attu was in American hands, and on 15 August U.S. Forces found that the Japanese had completely abandoned Kiska.\n\nCutter ''Onondaga'' and the other ships assigned to the Northern Pacific Force remained on patrol in northern waters through the end of the war.  She returned to the [[United States Treasury Department]] on 1 January 1946, and resumed patrol duties out of Astoria.\n\nThe ''Onondaga'' also gained fame for having rescued the survivors of the liner S S Yukon wrecked near Seward, Alaska in February 4, 1946.<ref>{{Cite news|first= |last= |authorlink=   |title= Alaskan Ship Breaks Up, Rescue Work Continues |newspaper=[[Saskatoon Star-Phoenix]]|date=February 5, 1946 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=urtjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=O3oNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2302,2823519&dq=cutter+onondaga&hl=en  |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n''Onondaga'' was decommissioned on 24 July 1947, she was sold on 7 December 1954 to [[Foss Launch and Tug Company]] of Seattle, Washington.\n\n==Update==\n\nApril, 2011, Environmental Protection Agency divers surveyed the Onondaga's hull, which had been shorn of its superstructure, sunk at a pier in the Lake Washington Ship Canal near Seattle.

From her commissioning until 1941, ''Onondaga'' was stationed at [[Astoria, Oregon]], where she performed important law enforcement duties and rendered much assistance to ships in distress.  Each year she patrolled the annual [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] seal migration to the [[Pribilof Islands]], and she attempted to prevent out of season [[halibut]] fishing.\n\nExecutive Order 8929 of 1 November 1941 transferred the Coast Guard to the [[United States Navy|Navy]].  ''Onondaga'' continued on general [[patrol]] duty, with her base of operations alternating between [[Seattle, Washington]] and [[Ketchikan, Alaska]].  When the [[United States|American]] [[cargo ship|merchantman]] ''Mauna Ala'' went aground on 10 December 1941 on [[Clatsop Beach, Oregon]], during a blackout test, ''Onondaga'' rushed to the scene and rescued thirty-six crewmen.\n\nThen assigned to [[Escort destroyer|escort]] duty in the area of [[Womens Bay, Alaska|Women's Bay]] and [[Kodiak, Alaska]], she was later ordered to escort duty between [[Cape Spencer (Alaska)|Cape Spencer]] and [[Dutch Harbor, Alaska]], as well as [[anti-aircraft]] and escort patrol off Dutch Harbor.\n\nWhen the Navy learned that the [[Japan]]ese planned a thrust into [[Alaska]]n waters as part of their [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] operation, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Chester W. Nimitz|Nimitz]] allocated five [[cruiser]]s, fourteen [[destroyer]]s, six [[submarine]]s, and suitable auxiliaries to counter the opposing forces in the North.  Five years before the outbreak of war the area had been virtually undefended.  But by September 1941, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], Kodiak, and Dutch Harbor had been commissioned as [[Naval Air Station]]s, and both Kodiak and Sitka were able to service submarines.  In mid-1940, the [[United States Army|Army]] had established the [[Alaska Defense Command]], with [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.|Simon Bolivar Buckner]] in command; and the Navy created an [[Alaskan Sector]] under the [[13th Naval District]], appointing [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[Ralph C. Parker]] to the command.\n\nParker's \"Alaskan Navy\" consisted of the gunboat, [[USS Charleston (PG-51)|''Charleston'']], as headquarters and flagship, along with the ''Onondaga'' and three former [[fishing boat]]s (''[[USS YP-72|YP-72]]'', ''[[USS YP-73|YP-73]]'', ''[[USS YP-74|YP-74]]''), converted to patrol craft.\"  [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Charles E.

''Charleston'' alone possessed sonar, or guns larger than three inch.  She, together with the destroyers and cutters, saw constant use as escorts for the [[cargo ship|freighter]]s that brought workers and material to the new bases and airfields, none of which were complete at this time.\n\nToward the end of May, when the Japanese sent one task force towards Midway and another towards the [[Aleutians]], tension quickened throughout the Pacific.  [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Robert A. Theobald]], USN, Commander [[North Pacific Force]], who had been headquartered at Kodiak through the early part of May, put to sea on 1 June in [[USS Nashville (CL-43)|''Nashville'' (CL-43)]] and rendezvoused with his augmented cruiser task force to thwart the Japanese Alaska venture.  However, \"Efforts to meet the enemy,\" writes Willoughby \"were unavailing, and there was no fleet action in Alaskan waters.\"\n\nCutter ''Onondaga'', with [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] S.

No Japanese plan for invading the Alaskan mainland, [[Canada]], or the United States existed.  The Aleutian section of the Midway operation was essentially defensive, although also diversionary.
