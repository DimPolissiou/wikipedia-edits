From 1991 it was known as '''Tilbury Douglas''' following a merger with RM Douglas, but in 2001 rebranded as '''Interserve plc'''. The name change partly reflected a shift in focus during the 1990s towards [[Property maintenance|maintenance]] and [[facilities management]] services sectors, and this continued in the 2000s, buoyed by further acquisitions.\n\nHowever, financial issues including problem contracts in Interserve's [[energy-from-waste]] business led to profit warnings in 2017. The company was forced to restructure and refinance in March 2018. Its financial situation worsened in late 2018, and debt holders started discussing a further financial restructuring of the business. The debt-for-equity plan was rejected at an [[annual general meeting]] on 15 March 2019, and the parent company went into [[administration (law)|administration]] owing creditors over \u00a3100m.

There was a further synergy between lightering and dredging; lightering was necessary where ports were shallow and the draft of a vessel needed to be reduced to facilitate their entry into [[port]], whereas dredging increased the depth of river channels to enable vessels with a larger draft to [[Berth (moorings)|berth]] into port. The company's move into dredging therefore protected its commercial interest against the perceived threat to lightering. This can be seen vindicated by the decline in lighterage for dry [[bulk cargo]] after the middle of the 20th century, although the eventual decline in lighterage was caused by the adoption of [[road haulage]] as the main distribution method when London's docks moved downstream (away from what is now known as [[London Docklands|Docklands]]) and [[shipping]] adopted [[containerisation]] methods.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1967/dec/18/thames-lighterage-industry UK Parliamentary Debate 18 December 1967] Hansard 18 December 1967 Retrieved 18 March 2013</ref> However, for the time being lightering still thrived and the [[New Zealand]]-based ''[[Ashburton Guardian]]'' reported in 1890 that the company was an early pioneer in the transshipment of frozen meat.

From 1991 it was known as '''Tilbury Douglas''' following a merger with RM Douglas, but in 2001 rebranded as '''Interserve plc'''. The name change partly reflected a shift in focus during the 1990s towards [[Property maintenance|maintenance]] and [[facilities management]] services sectors, and this continued in the 2000s, buoyed by further acquisitions.\n\nHowever, financial issues including problem contracts in Interserve's [[energy-from-waste]] business led to profit warnings in 2017. The company was forced to restructure and refinance in March 2018. Its financial situation worsened in late 2018, and debt holders started discussing a further financial restructuring of the business. The debt-for-equity plan was rejected at an [[annual general meeting]] on 15 March 2019, and the parent company went into [[administration (law)|administration]] owing creditors over \u00a3100m.

There was a further synergy between lightering and dredging; lightering was necessary where ports were shallow and the draft of a vessel needed to be reduced to facilitate their entry into [[port]], whereas dredging increased the depth of river channels to enable vessels with a larger draft to [[Berth (moorings)|berth]] into port. The company's move into dredging therefore protected its commercial interest against the perceived threat to lightering. This can be seen vindicated by the decline in lighterage for dry [[bulk cargo]] after the middle of the 20th century, although the eventual decline in lighterage was caused by the adoption of [[road haulage]] as the main distribution method when London's docks moved downstream (away from what is now known as [[London Docklands|Docklands]]) and [[shipping]] adopted [[containerisation]] methods.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1967/dec/18/thames-lighterage-industry UK Parliamentary Debate 18 December 1967] Hansard 18 December 1967 Retrieved 18 March 2013</ref> However, for the time being lightering still thrived and the [[New Zealand]]-based ''[[Ashburton Guardian]]'' reported in 1890 that the company was an early pioneer in the transshipment of frozen meat.

An amateur sumo competitor while studying at [[Kinki University]], he made his professional debut in January 2009. He reached the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division in July 2013. His highest rank to date has been ''[[maegashira]]'' 2.  He has won championships in the ''[[makuuchi]]'', ''[[j\u016bry\u014d]]'',  ''[[jonokuchi]]'' and ''[[sandanme]]'' divisions. He was runner-up in the January 2015 tournament. He wrestles for [[Kise stable (2003)|Kise stable]]. After spending most of 2018 and 2019 in the second tier he returned to the top division in January 2020 and recorded 14 wins to take an upset championship victory at the age of 33.\n\n==Early life and sumo background==\nMakoto Aoki first tried out sumo at a ''[[dojo]]'' outside his school when he was a fourth grader in elementary school. He continued into junior high school at another ''dojo'' then transferred to Meitoku Gijuku High School, which was well known for its sumo program.<ref name=\"ajw0127\">{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ202001270055.html|title=SUMO/ Tokushoryu has last laugh in overcoming mentor\u2019s death|date=27 January 2020|work=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref> In his second year there he took an inter-high school championship and in his third year he was in the top 8 group of high school wrestlers. He entered a management program at [[Kindai University]] and also continued amateur sumo.<ref name=\"ajw0127\"/> He was not able to attain university ''[[yokozuna]]'' status, but did manage to win some regional championships. \n\nAs he was involved in sumo much of his school life, many current and former wrestlers were his teammates during his amateur sumo years at school. At his high school, [[Tochi\u014dzan]] was from his year, and {{Interlanguage link multi|Chiyozakura Ukyo|ja|3=\u5343\u4ee3\u685c\u53f3\u4eac|lt=Chiyozakura}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Dewa\u014dtori Taichi|ja|3=\u51fa\u7fbd\u9cf3\u592a\u4e00|lt=Dewa\u014dtori}} were his upper classmen. In university [[Homarefuji]] was an upperclassman, and [[Takarafuji]], in his year, was in the same management course as he was.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Tokushoryu 2011 Sep.JPG|thumb|left|Tokush\u014dry\u016b at the Aki basho in September 2011, when he was ranked in the ''[[makushita]]'' division]]\n\n===Early career===\nIn his fourth year in university he made the decision to join [[Kise stable (2003)|Kise stable]] and first stepped into the ring for the January 2009 tournament, along with other contemporaries such as Takarafuji, [[Kimikaze]] and [[Takanoiwa]]. Despite his successes in amateur sumo, he never achieved student ''yokozuna'' status so was not allowed to enter professional sumo at an elevated rank (see ''[[makushita tsukedashi]]'') and had to start at the bottom of the ranks. \n\nHis skill and experience allowed him a string of winning tournaments from his entry into sumo, and he also took the bottom division ''[[jonokuchi]]'' championship in his debut tournament, with a 6-1 score without a playoff, which is very rare in Sumo, followed by a perfect 7\u20130 ''[[sandanme]]'' championship in September of that same year. He was promoted to the ''[[makushita]]'' division in the November tournament following his championship. He spent all of 2010 in ''makushita'' and had only two losing tournaments until reaching ''makushita'' 2 in November of that year. Though on the cusp of being promoted to the salaried ranks of ''j\u016bry\u014d'', he only managed a 1\u20136 record.  He changed his [[shikona|ring name]] from his surname to his current one in January 2011. He spent most of 2011 working his way through ''makushita'' much as he had in 2010. On reaching ''makushita'' 1 in the September tournament he put in an impressive 5\u20132 record and achieve promotion to ''j\u016bry\u014d'' on his second chance. \n\nIn his first ''j\u016bry\u014d'' tournament in November 2011 he garnered a lot of attention by winning his first seven bouts, however he lost four in a row after that ending with a 10\u20135. This was followed by a disastrous 2\u201313 record for the January 2012 tournament, largely due to a knee injury, which dropped him back to ''makushita''. He fought back with a 4\u20133 record in the following March tournament and earned re-promotion to ''j\u016bry\u014d''. From this point on he managed to work his way through ''j\u016bry\u014d'' posting mostly winning records. This continued up until the May 2013 tournament where he achieved a strong 12\u20133 record and almost took the ''j\u016bry\u014d'' championship, only losing it to [[Kotoy\u016bki]] on the last day of the tournament. This was still enough to earn him promotion to the top-tier ''[[makuuchi]]'' division for the July 2013 tournament. \n\n===Makuuchi career===\nIn his first top-tier tournament he managed a 9\u20136 record, making him the first ''makuuchi'' debut wrestler in 2013 to achieve a winning record. In the following two tournaments however, he would get two consecutive losing records, just barely managing to avoid demotion. He dropped to the second division in 2014 but was immediately promoted back to ''makuuchi'' after posting a 12\u20133 record. Fighting from the low rank of ''maegashira'' 16 in the January 2015 tournament he scored 11\u20134 and was runner-up to [[Hakuh\u014d Sh\u014d|Hakuh\u014d]] who won a record-breaking 33rd ''[[y\u016bsh\u014d]]''. He remained in the top division for the next two years, reaching a career high rank of ''maegashira'' 4 in May 2015. He then dropped down the ''banzuke'' and was relegated again after the September 2016 tournament. He returned to makuuchi in March 2017, but a record of only 4\u201311 in consecutive tournaments in July and September saw him demoted to ''j\u016bry\u014d'' once again. In September 2018 he won his first ''j\u016bry\u014d'' division championship after a playoff win over [[Daiamami]]. He returned to the top division in May 2019 but only for one tournament as he recorded four wins against eleven losses, a failure he later attributed to a \"lack of appetite for victory\" because he was content simply to be in ''makuuchi'' again.<ref name=\"jt0127\">{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2020/01/27/sumo/tokushoryu-revels-improbable-basho-triumph/#.Xi8RbOSWymQ|title=Tokushoryu revels in improbable basho triumph|date=27 January 2020|work=Japan Times|accessdate=27 January 2020}}</ref> \n\nAfter recording eight wins in November 2019 he earned his sixth promotion to the top division and started the January tournament at west ''maegashira'' 17, making him the lowest-ranked of the 42 entrants. He defeated [[Chiyosh\u014dma Fujio|Chiyosh\u014dma]] in his first bout before losing to [[Kaisei Ichir\u014d|Kaisei]] on the second day but then recorded eleven straight wins to enter the penultimate day in a tie for the lead with [[Sh\u014ddai Naoya|Sh\u014ddai]]. He was then matched against Sh\u014ddai and won by ''[[Kimarite#Tsukiotoshi \u7a81\u304d\u843d\u3068\u3057|tsukiotoshi]]'' to take the sole lead. The final match on the last day of the tournament saw Tokush\u014dry\u016b pitted against the ''ozeki'' [[Takakeish\u014d Mitsunobu|Takakeish\u014d]] needing to win to take the title: if he lost he would have had to face Sh\u014ddai again in a play-off. Tokush\u014dry\u016b secured a right hand outside grip on Takakeish\u014d's belt and forced his opponent out of the ring to win by ''yorikiri''. He became the first wrestler from Nara Prefecture to win a top division championship in 98 years and the first to do so from the bottom rank in the division since [[Takat\u014driki]] in March 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/01/7010ad302c4a-sumo-tokushoryu-defies-odds-to-claim-maiden-title-at-new-year-meet.html|title=Sumo: Tokushoryu defies odds to claim maiden title at New Year meet|date=26 January 2020|work=Kyodo News|accessdate=26 January 2020}}</ref> In addition to the ''y\u016bsh\u014d'', Tokush\u014dry\u016b also received his first ever ''[[sansh\u014d (Sumo)|sansh\u014d]]'' or special prizes, for Outstanding Performance and Fighting Spirit.<ref name=\"jt0127\"/> When asked if his good results in the early part of the ''basho'' had led him to focus on the championship he said \"I didn\u2019t think about it...

While he was a member of [[Kitanoumi stable]], head coach [[Kitanoumi]] encouraged him to go for a left hand inside grip on the belt, ''hidari-yotsu'', recognizing his power, and this is the technique

[[rikishi|wrestler]] from [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], Japan. An amateur sumo competitor while studying at [[Kinki University]], he made his professional debut in January 2009. He reached the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division in July 2013. His highest rank to date has been ''[[maegashira]]'' 2.  He has won championships in the ''[[makuuchi]]'', ''[[j\u016bry\u014d]]'',  ''[[jonokuchi]]'' and ''[[sandanme]]'' divisions. He was runner-up in the January 2015 tournament. He wrestles for [[Kise stable (2003)|Kise stable]]. After spending most of 2018 and 2019 in the second tier he returned to the top division in January 2020 and recorded 14 wins to take an upset championship victory at the age of 33.\n\n==Early life and sumo background==\nMakoto Aoki first tried out sumo at a ''[[dojo]]'' outside his school when he was a fourth grader in elementary school. He continued into junior high school at another ''dojo'' then transferred to Meitoku Gijuku High School, which was well known for its sumo program.<ref name=\"ajw0127\">{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ202001270055.html|title=SUMO/ Tokushoryu has last laugh in overcoming mentor\u2019s death|date=27 January 2020|work=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref> In his second year there he took an inter-high school championship and in his third year he was in the top 8 group of high school wrestlers. He entered a management program at [[Kindai University]] and also continued amateur sumo.<ref name=\"ajw0127\"/> He was not able to attain university ''[[yokozuna]]'' status, but did manage to win some regional championships. \n\nAs he was involved in sumo much of his school life, many current and former wrestlers were his teammates during his amateur sumo years at school. At his high school, [[Tochi\u014dzan]] was from his year, and {{Interlanguage link multi|Chiyozakura Ukyo|ja|3=\u5343\u4ee3\u685c\u53f3\u4eac|lt=Chiyozakura}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Dewa\u014dtori Taichi|ja|3=\u51fa\u7fbd\u9cf3\u592a\u4e00|lt=Dewa\u014dtori}} were his upper classmen. In university [[Homarefuji]] was an upperclassman, and [[Takarafuji]], in his year, was in the same management course as he was.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Tokushoryu 2011 Sep.JPG|thumb|left|Tokush\u014dry\u016b at the Aki basho in September 2011, when he was ranked in the ''[[makushita]]'' division]]\n\n===Early career===\nIn his fourth year in university he made the decision to join [[Kise stable (2003)|Kise stable]] and first stepped into the ring for the January 2009 tournament, along with other contemporaries such as Takarafuji, [[Kimikaze]] and [[Takanoiwa]]. Despite his successes in amateur sumo, he never achieved student ''yokozuna'' status so was not allowed to enter professional sumo at an elevated rank (see ''[[makushita tsukedashi]]'') and had to start at the bottom of the ranks. \n\nHis skill and experience allowed him a string of winning tournaments from his entry into sumo, and he also took the bottom division ''[[jonokuchi]]'' championship in his debut tournament, with a 6-1 score without a playoff, which is very rare in Sumo, followed by a perfect 7\u20130 ''[[sandanme]]'' championship in September of that same year. He was promoted to the ''[[makushita]]'' division in the November tournament following his championship. He spent all of 2010 in ''makushita'' and had only two losing tournaments until reaching ''makushita'' 2 in November of that year. Though on the cusp of being promoted to the salaried ranks of ''j\u016bry\u014d'', he only managed a 1\u20136 record.  He changed his [[shikona|ring name]] from his surname to his current one in January 2011. He spent most of 2011 working his way through ''makushita'' much as he had in 2010. On reaching ''makushita'' 1 in the September tournament he put in an impressive 5\u20132 record and achieve promotion to ''j\u016bry\u014d'' on his second chance. \n\nIn his first ''j\u016bry\u014d'' tournament in November 2011 he garnered a lot of attention by winning his first seven bouts, however he lost four in a row after that ending with a 10\u20135. This was followed by a disastrous 2\u201313 record for the January 2012 tournament, largely due to a knee injury, which dropped him back to ''makushita''. He fought back with a 4\u20133 record in the following March tournament and earned re-promotion to ''j\u016bry\u014d''. From this point on he managed to work his way through ''j\u016bry\u014d'' posting mostly winning records. This continued up until the May 2013 tournament where he achieved a strong 12\u20133 record and almost took the ''j\u016bry\u014d'' championship, only losing it to [[Kotoy\u016bki]] on the last day of the tournament. This was still enough to earn him promotion to the top-tier ''[[makuuchi]]'' division for the July 2013 tournament. \n\n===Makuuchi career===\nIn his first top-tier tournament he managed a 9\u20136 record, making him the first ''makuuchi'' debut wrestler in 2013 to achieve a winning record. In the following two tournaments however, he would get two consecutive losing records, just barely managing to avoid demotion. He dropped to the second division in 2014 but was immediately promoted back to ''makuuchi'' after posting a 12\u20133 record. Fighting from the low rank of ''maegashira'' 16 in the January 2015 tournament he scored 11\u20134 and was runner-up to [[Hakuh\u014d Sh\u014d|Hakuh\u014d]] who won a record-breaking 33rd ''[[y\u016bsh\u014d]]''. He remained in the top division for the next two years, reaching a career high rank of ''maegashira'' 4 in May 2015. He then dropped down the ''banzuke'' and was relegated again after the September 2016 tournament. He returned to makuuchi in March 2017, but a record of only 4\u201311 in consecutive tournaments in July and September saw him demoted to ''j\u016bry\u014d'' once again. In September 2018 he won his first ''j\u016bry\u014d'' division championship after a playoff win over [[Daiamami]]. He returned to the top division in May 2019 but only for one tournament as he recorded four wins against eleven losses, a failure he later attributed to a \"lack of appetite for victory\" because he was content simply to be in ''makuuchi'' again.<ref name=\"jt0127\">{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2020/01/27/sumo/tokushoryu-revels-improbable-basho-triumph/#.Xi8RbOSWymQ|title=Tokushoryu revels in improbable basho triumph|date=27 January 2020|work=Japan Times|accessdate=27 January 2020}}</ref> \n\nAfter recording eight wins in November 2019 he earned his sixth promotion to the top division and started the January tournament at west ''maegashira'' 17, making him the lowest-ranked of the 42 entrants. He defeated [[Chiyosh\u014dma Fujio|Chiyosh\u014dma]] in his first bout before losing to [[Kaisei Ichir\u014d|Kaisei]] on the second day but then recorded eleven straight wins to enter the penultimate day in a tie for the lead with [[Sh\u014ddai Naoya|Sh\u014ddai]]. He was then matched against Sh\u014ddai and won by ''[[Kimarite#Tsukiotoshi \u7a81\u304d\u843d\u3068\u3057|tsukiotoshi]]'' to take the sole lead. The final match on the last day of the tournament saw Tokush\u014dry\u016b pitted against the ''ozeki'' [[Takakeish\u014d Mitsunobu|Takakeish\u014d]] needing to win to take the title: if he lost he would have had to face Sh\u014ddai again in a play-off. Tokush\u014dry\u016b secured a right hand outside grip on Takakeish\u014d's belt and forced his opponent out of the ring to win by ''yorikiri''. He became the first wrestler from Nara Prefecture to win a top division championship in 98 years and the first to do so from the bottom rank in the division since [[Takat\u014driki]] in March 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/01/7010ad302c4a-sumo-tokushoryu-defies-odds-to-claim-maiden-title-at-new-year-meet.html|title=Sumo: Tokushoryu defies odds to claim maiden title at New Year meet|date=26 January 2020|work=Kyodo News|accessdate=26 January 2020}}</ref> In addition to the ''y\u016bsh\u014d'', Tokush\u014dry\u016b also received his first ever ''[[sansh\u014d (Sumo)|sansh\u014d]]'' or special prizes, for Outstanding Performance and Fighting Spirit.<ref name=\"jt0127\"/> When asked if his good results in the early part of the ''basho'' had led him to focus on the championship he said \"I didn\u2019t think about it...

Between 1969 and 1974, Vustin worked as a music editor at USSR Radio. From 1974 he worked as an editor at the [[Kompozitor]] publishing house.\n\n==Music==\nVustin has composed since 1963: however, he regards only those works written since 1972 as valid. His musical language is distinctive by the remarkable organization of its musical texture. Vustin uses the [[twelve-tone technique]], but in his own original way.\n\nHis first notable compositions were written in the midst of the 70s: the eight-minute-long ''The Word'' (scored for ensemble of woodwinds, brass and percussion (1975)) was dedicated to Grigori Frid; and the three-minute long ''In Memory of [[Boris Klyuzner]]'', for baritone and string quartet (1977) was set to the autobiographical text by [[Yuri Olesha]].  Another striking piece, ''Blessed are the Poor in Spirit'' for boy-soprano (or counter-tenor) accompanied by a chamber ensemble was composed in 1988 to the text from Matthew 5:3\u20138.\n\nHis opera ''[[The Devil in Love (opera)|The Devil in Love]]'', to the Russian libretto by [[Vladimir Khachaturov]] after the novel ''[[The Devil in Love (novel)|The Devil in Love]]'' by [[Jacques Cazotte]], the result of 15 years of labour, (1975\u20131989) is probably one of the most important of his works. Its musical material nourished the dozens of compositions written in around the same period. The world premiere of the opera took place on 15 February 2019 at the [[Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre]] under [[Vladimir Jurowski]], conductor.\n\nThe works of Alexander Vustin are often included in the programmes of major festivals, such as the \"Kremerata Musica\", Tage f\u00fcr Neue Musik (Z\u00fcrich), Holland Festival, the 14th Musik Biennale Berlin, Pres\u00e8nce 93 (Paris), Melos-Ethos (Bratislava), Maraton Soudobe Hudby (Prague), Donaueschinger Musiktage and Deutsche Kammerphilarmonie (Germany), Kammermusikfest Lockenhaus (Austria), Moscow Forum, and Moscow Autumn (Russia). Among performers of his music are the conductors [[Vladimir Jurowski]], [[Reinbert de Leeuw]], [[Lev Markiz]], [[Eri Klas]], [[Igor Dronov]], [[Alexander Lazarev]], [[Vitaly Kataev]], [[Gidon Kremer]], [[Martyn Brabbins]], and [[Cristoph Hagel]]. Ensembles include [[Kremerata Baltica]], Amsterdam Wind Orchestra, Sch\u00f6nberg Ensemble, Radio Philharmonic Orchestra and Nieuw Sinfonietta Amsterdam (Netherlands), the Mark Pekasky Percussion Ensemble, Studio New Music, Ensemble of Soloists of the Bolshoi Theatre, the Moscow Contemporary Music Ensemble, and the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]].\n\nHe died on 19 April 2020 from pneumonia.<ref>[https://rg.ru/2020/04/19/ot-pnevmonii-umer-kompozitor-aleksandr-vustin.html \u041e\u0442 \u043f\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0412\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d], rg.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[Image:Wustin.jpg|thumb|Alexander Vustin (2008)]]\nVustin's works were published by [[Hans Sikorski]].<ref name=\"Sikorski\" />\n* ''Three Poems of Moses Teif'' for bass and piano, in Russian, translated by [[Yunna Moritz]], (1965)\n* String Quartet (1966)\n* Symphony (1969)\n* ''Three Toropets songs'' for piano (1972)\n* Nocturnes for chamber ensemble and high voice in three movements (1972\u20131982)\n* ''Sonata for six'' for piccolo, flute, clarinet, viola, cello, and 5 string double bass (1973\n* ''Lamento'' for piano (1974)\n* ''Toropets Songs'' for ensemble (1975\n* ''The Word'' for winds and percussions, dedicated. text by Fried (1975)\n* Capriccio (tunes from the collection of M.

Between 1969 and 1974, Vustin worked as a music editor at USSR Radio. From 1974 he worked as an editor at the [[Kompozitor]] publishing house.\n\n==Music==\nVustin has composed since 1963: however, he regards only those works written since 1972 as valid. His musical language is distinctive by the remarkable organization of its musical texture. Vustin uses the [[twelve-tone technique]], but in his own original way.\n\nHis first notable compositions were written in the midst of the 70s: the eight-minute-long ''The Word'' (scored for ensemble of woodwinds, brass and percussion (1975)) was dedicated to Grigori Frid; and the three-minute long ''In Memory of [[Boris Klyuzner]]'', for baritone and string quartet (1977) was set to the autobiographical text by [[Yuri Olesha]].  Another striking piece, ''Blessed are the Poor in Spirit'' for boy-soprano (or counter-tenor) accompanied by a chamber ensemble was composed in 1988 to the text from Matthew 5:3\u20138.\n\nHis opera ''[[The Devil in Love (opera)|The Devil in Love]]'', to the Russian libretto by [[Vladimir Khachaturov]] after the novel ''[[The Devil in Love (novel)|The Devil in Love]]'' by [[Jacques Cazotte]], the result of 15 years of labour, (1975\u20131989) is probably one of the most important of his works. Its musical material nourished the dozens of compositions written in around the same period. The world premiere of the opera took place on 15 February 2019 at the [[Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre]] under [[Vladimir Jurowski]], conductor.\n\nThe works of Alexander Vustin are often included in the programmes of major festivals, such as the \"Kremerata Musica\", Tage f\u00fcr Neue Musik (Z\u00fcrich), Holland Festival, the 14th Musik Biennale Berlin, Pres\u00e8nce 93 (Paris), Melos-Ethos (Bratislava), Maraton Soudobe Hudby (Prague), Donaueschinger Musiktage and Deutsche Kammerphilarmonie (Germany), Kammermusikfest Lockenhaus (Austria), Moscow Forum, and Moscow Autumn (Russia). Among performers of his music are the conductors [[Vladimir Jurowski]], [[Reinbert de Leeuw]], [[Lev Markiz]], [[Eri Klas]], [[Igor Dronov]], [[Alexander Lazarev]], [[Vitaly Kataev]], [[Gidon Kremer]], [[Martyn Brabbins]], and [[Cristoph Hagel]]. Ensembles include [[Kremerata Baltica]], Amsterdam Wind Orchestra, Sch\u00f6nberg Ensemble, Radio Philharmonic Orchestra and Nieuw Sinfonietta Amsterdam (Netherlands), the Mark Pekasky Percussion Ensemble, Studio New Music, Ensemble of Soloists of the Bolshoi Theatre, the Moscow Contemporary Music Ensemble, and the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]].\n\nHe died on 19 April 2020 from pneumonia.<ref>[https://rg.ru/2020/04/19/ot-pnevmonii-umer-kompozitor-aleksandr-vustin.html \u041e\u0442 \u043f\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0412\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d], rg.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[Image:Wustin.jpg|thumb|Alexander Vustin (2008)]]\nVustin's works were published by [[Hans Sikorski]].<ref name=\"Sikorski\" />\n* ''Three Poems of Moses Teif'' for bass and piano, in Russian, translated by [[Yunna Moritz]], (1965)\n* String Quartet (1966)\n* Symphony (1969)\n* ''Three Toropets songs'' for piano (1972)\n* Nocturnes for chamber ensemble and high voice in three movements (1972\u20131982)\n* ''Sonata for six'' for piccolo, flute, clarinet, viola, cello, and 5 string double bass (1973\n* ''Lamento'' for piano (1974)\n* ''Toropets Songs'' for ensemble (1975\n* ''The Word'' for winds and percussions, dedicated. text by Fried (1975)\n* Capriccio (tunes from the collection of M.

His personal sacrifice and untiring efforts to keep the Jamia afloat in very adverse circumstances won him appreciation of even his arch political rivals like [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]].\n\nSoon after India attained independence, Husain agreed to be the Vice chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University which was facing trying times in post partition India because of active involvement of a section of its teachers and students in the movement for creation of [[Pakistan]].

{"title_page": "Stone tool", "text_new": "[[File:Stone Tools from Skorba.jpg|thumb|Stone Tools from [[Skorba]]]]\n{{short description|Any tool, partially or entirely, made out of stone}}{{Stone Age|235}}\n{{Distinguish|Tool stone}}\n\nA '''stone tool''' is, in the most general sense, any [[tool]] made either partially or entirely out of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]. Although stone tool-dependent societies and cultures still exist today, most stone tools are associated with [[prehistory|prehistoric]] (particularly [[Stone Age]]) cultures that have become extinct. [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] often study such prehistoric societies, and refer to the study of stone tools as [[lithic analysis]]. [[Ethnoarchaeology]] has been a valuable research field in order to further the understanding and cultural implications of stone tool use and manufacture.<ref>Sillitoe, P. and K. Hardy 2003 Living lithics: ethnoarchaeology in highland Papua New Guinea. Antiquity 77:555-566</ref>\n\nStone has been used to make a wide variety of different tools throughout history, including [[arrow heads]], spearpoints and [[querns]]. Stone tools may be made of either [[ground stone]] or [[chipped stone]], and a person who creates tools out of the latter is known as a [[flintknapper]].\n \nChipped stone tools are made from [[cryptocrystal]]line materials such as [[chert]] or [[flint]], [[radiolarite]], [[chalcedony]], [[obsidian]], [[basalt]], and  [[quartzite]] via a process known as [[lithic reduction]]. One simple form of reduction is to strike stone [[lithic flake|flake]]s from a nucleus (core) of material using a [[hammerstone]] or similar hard hammer fabricator. If the goal of the reduction strategy is to produce flakes, the remnant [[lithic core]] may be discarded once it has become too small to use. In some strategies, however, a [[flintknapper]] reduces the core to a rough [[uniface|unifacial]] or [[biface|bifacial]] [[Lithic reduction#Preform|preform]], which is further reduced using [[soft hammer]] flaking techniques or by [[pressure flaking]] the edges.\n\nMore complex forms of reduction include the production of highly standardized blades, which can then be fashioned into a variety of tools such as [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s, [[knife|knives]], [[sickle]]s and [[microliths]]. In general terms, chipped stone tools are nearly ubiquitous in all pre-metal-using societies because they are easily manufactured, the [[tool stone]] is usually plentiful, and they are easy to transport and sharpen.\n\n==Evolution==\n[[File:National park stone tools.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A selection of [[prehistoric]] stone tools]]\n\nArchaeologists classify stone tools into [[Industry (archaeology)|industries]] (also known as complexes or technocomplexes<ref name=\"Clarke 1978\">{{Cite book|title=Analytical Archaeology|last=Clarke|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1978|isbn=0231046308|edition=2nd|location=New York, NY|pages=372\u2013373}}</ref>) that share distinctive technological or morphological characteristics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dynamics of Learning in Neanderthals and Modern Humans Volume 1: Cultural Perspectives|last=Kadowaki|first=Seiji|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9784431545118|editor-last=Akazawa|editor-first=Takeru|location=Tokyo|pages=62\u201363|chapter=Issues of Chronological and Geographical Distributions of Middle and Upper Palaeolithic Cultural Variability in the Levant and Implications for the Learning Behaviour of Neanderthals and ''Homo sapiens''|editor-last2=Nishiaki|editor-first2=Yoshihiro|editor-last3=Aoki|editor-first3=Kenichi}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969 in the 2nd edition of ''World Prehistory'', [[Grahame Clark]] proposed an evolutionary progression of [[flint-knapping]] in which the \"dominant lithic technologies\" occurred in a fixed sequence from Mode 1 through Mode 5.<ref>{{cite book | first=Grahame |last=Clarke |title=World Prehistory: a New Outline | year=1969 |edition=2 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge |page=31}}</ref> He assigned to them relative dates: Modes 1 and 2 to the Lower [[Palaeolithic]], 3 to the [[Middle Palaeolithic]], 4 to the [[Upper Paleolithic|Advanced]] and 5 to the [[Mesolithic]]. They were not to be conceived, however, as either universal\u2014that is, they did not account for all [[lithic technology]]; or as synchronous\u2014they were not in effect in different regions simultaneously. Mode 1, for example, was in use in [[Europe]] long after it had been replaced by Mode 2 in [[Africa]].\n\nClark's scheme was adopted enthusiastically by the archaeological community. One of its advantages was the simplicity of terminology; for example, the Mode 1 / Mode 2 Transition. The transitions are currently of greatest interest. Consequently, in the literature the stone tools used in the period of the [[Palaeolithic]] are divided into four \"modes\", each of which designate a different form of complexity, and which in most cases followed a rough [[chronological]] order.\n\n===Pre-Mode I===\n;Kenya\nStone tools found from 2011 to 2014 at [[Lake Turkana]] in [[Kenya]], are dated to be 3.3 million years old, and predate the genus ''Homo'' by half million years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harmand|first=Sonia|last2=Lewis|first2=Jason E.|last3=Feibel|first3=Craig S.|last4=Lepre|first4=Christopher J.|last5=Prat|first5=Sandrine|last6=Lenoble|first6=Arnaud|last7=Bo\u00ebs|first7=Xavier|last8=Quinn|first8=Rhonda L.|last9=Brenet|first9=Michel|date=2015-05-20|title=3.3-million-year-old stone tools from Lomekwi 3, West Turkana, Kenya|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=521|issue=7552|pages=310\u2013315|doi=10.1038/nature14464|pmid=25993961|issn=0028-0836}}</ref> The oldest known ''Homo'' fossil is 2.8 million years old compared to the 3.3 million year old stone tools.<ref name='Morelle'>{{cite news |last=Morelle |first=Rebecca |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-32804177 |title=Oldest stone tools pre-date earliest humans |work=BBC News |date=20 May 2015 |accessdate=2016-01-03 }}</ref>  The stone tools may have been made by ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' or [[Kenyanthropus|''Kenyanthropus platyops'']]\u2014 (a 3.2 to 3.5-million-year-old [[Pliocene]] hominin fossil discovered in 1999) the species whose best fossil example is [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], which inhabited East Africa at the same time as the date of the oldest stone tools.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Wrong Turn Leads to Discovery of Oldest Stone Tools| url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150520-oldest-stone-tools-discovery-harmand-archaeology| website = National Geographic News| accessdate = 2015-05-21|first = Nadia| last = Drake| first2 = for National Geographic PUBLISHED May| last2 = 20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| title = 3.3-million-year-old stone tools from Lomekwi 3, West Turkana, Kenya| journal = Nature| date = May 21, 2015| issn = 0028-0836| pages = 310\u2013315| volume = 521| issue = 7552| doi = 10.1038/nature14464| first = Sonia| last = Harmand| first2 = Jason E.| last2 = Lewis| first3 = Craig S.| last3 = Feibel| first4 = Christopher J.|last4 = Lepre|first5 = Sandrine|last5 = Prat|first6 = Arnaud|last6 = Lenoble|first7 = Xavier|last7 = Bo\u00ebs|first8 = Rhonda L.|last8 = Quinn|first9 = Michel|last9 = Brenet| pmid=25993961}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title = The Oldest Stone Tools Yet Discovered Are Unearthed in Kenya| url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/oldest-known-stone-tools-unearthed-kenya-180955341/| accessdate = 2015-05-21| first = Helen| last = Thompson}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title = Stone Tools From Kenya Are Oldest Yet Discovered| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/science/stone-tools-from-kenya-are-oldest-yet-discovered.html| newspaper = The New York Times| date = 2015-05-20| access-date = 2015-05-30| issn = 0362-4331| first = John Noble| last = Wilford}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Oldest Known Stone Tools Discovered: 3.3 Million Years Old| url = http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/news/150520-stone-tools-discovery-vin| website = video.nationalgeographic.com| accessdate = 2015-06-15}}</ref> Dating of the tools was by dating volcanic ash layers in which the tools were found and dating the magnetic signature (pointing north or south due to reversal of the magnetic poles)  of the rock at the site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/how-a-disparate-team-found-the-worlds-oldest-tools|title=Nature Index|website=www.natureindex.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref>\n\n;Ethiopia\nGrooved, cut and fractured animal bone fossils, made by using stone tools, were found in [[Dikika]], [[Ethiopia]] near (200 yards) the remains of [[Selam (Australopithecus)|Selam]], a young ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' girl who lived about 3.3 million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Shannon P.

These cores were river pebbles, or rocks similar to them, that had been struck by a spherical [[hammerstone]] to cause [[conchoidal fracture]]s removing flakes from one surface, creating an edge and often a sharp tip. The blunt end is the proximal surface; the sharp, the distal. Oldowan is a percussion technology. Grasping the proximal surface, the hominid brought the distal surface down hard on an object he wished to detach or shatter, such as a bone or tuber.\n\nThe earliest known Oldowan tools yet found date from 2.6&nbsp;million years ago, during the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] period, and have been uncovered at Gona in [[Ethiopia]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Semaw, S. |author2=M.

The Industry flourished in southern and eastern Africa between 2.6 and 1.7&nbsp;million years ago, but was also spread out of Africa and into [[Eurasia]] by travelling bands of ''H. erectus'', who took it as far east as [[Java]] by 1.8&nbsp;million years ago and [[North China (continent)|Northern China]] by 1.6&nbsp;million years ago.\n\n===Mode II: The Acheulean Industry===\n[[File:Biface (trihedral) Amar Merdeg, Mehran, Ilam, Lower Paleolithic, National Museum of Iran.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Biface (trihedral) from Amar Merdeg, Zagros foothills, Lower Paleolithic, National Museum of Iran]]\n[[Image:Hand axe spanish.gif|thumb|upright=1.25|A typical Acheulean handaxe; this example is from the Douro valley, [[Zamora (province)|Zamora]], Spain. The small chips on the edge are from reworking.]]\n{{Commons category|Acheulean}}\n{{Main|Acheulean Industry}}\n\nEventually, more complex, Mode 2 tools began to be developed through the [[Acheulean Industry]], named after the site of [[Saint-Acheul (Amiens)|Saint-Acheul]] in France. The Acheulean was characterised not by the core, but by the [[biface]], the most notable form of which was the [[hand axe]].<ref>Clarke's \"bifacially flaked hand axes.\"</ref> The Acheulean first appears in the archaeological record as early as 1.7&nbsp;million years ago in the [[Turkana District|West Turkana]] area of [[Kenya]] and contemporaneously in southern Africa.\n\nThe Leakeys, excavators at Olduvai, defined a \"Developed Oldowan\" Period in which they believed they saw evidence of an overlap in Oldowan and Acheulean. In their species-specific view of the two industries, Oldowan equated to ''H. habilis'' and Acheulean to ''H. erectus''. Developed Oldowan was assigned to ''habilis'' and Acheulean to ''erectus''. Subsequent dates on ''H. erectus'' pushed the fossils back to well before Acheulean tools; that is, ''H. erectus'' must have initially used Mode 1. There was no reason to think, therefore, that Developed Oldowan had to be ''habilis''; it could have been ''erectus''. Opponents of the view divide Developed Oldowan between Oldowan and Acheulean. There is no question, however, that ''habilis'' and ''erectus'' coexisted, as ''habilis'' fossils are found as late as 1.4 million years ago. Meanwhile, African ''H. erectus'' developed Mode 2. In any case a wave of Mode 2 then spread across Eurasia, resulting in use of both there. ''H. erectus'' may not have been the only hominin to leave Africa; European fossils are sometimes associated with ''[[Homo ergaster]]'', a contemporary of ''H. erectus'' in Africa.\n\nIn contrast to an Oldowan tool, which is the result of a fortuitous and probably [[ex tempore]] operation to obtain one sharp edge on a stone, an Acheulean tool is a planned result of a manufacturing process. The manufacturer begins with a blank, either a larger stone or a slab knocked off a larger rock. From this blank he or she removes large flakes, to be used as cores. Standing a core on edge on an anvil stone, he or she hits the exposed edge with centripetal blows of a hard hammer to roughly shape the implement. Then the piece must be worked over again, or retouched, with a soft hammer of wood or bone to produce a tool finely chipped all over consisting of two convex surfaces intersecting in a sharp edge. Such a tool is used for slicing; concussion would destroy the edge and cut the hand.\n\nSome Mode 2 tools are disk-shaped, others ovoid, others leaf-shaped and pointed, and others elongated and pointed at the distal end, with a blunt surface at the proximal end, obviously used for drilling. Mode 2 tools are used for butchering; not being composite (having no haft) they are not very appropriate killing instruments. The killing must have been done some other way. Mode 2 tools are larger than Oldowan. The blank was ported to serve as an ongoing source of flakes until it was finally retouched as a finished tool itself. Edges were often sharpened by further retouching.\n\n===Mode III: The Mousterian Industry===\n[[File:Nucl\u00e9us Levallois La-Parrilla.png|thumb|upright=1.25|A tool made by the [[Levallois technique]]. This example is from La Parrilla (Valladolid, Spain).]]\n{{Commons category|Mousterian}}\n\n{{Main|Mousterian}}\n\nEventually, the Acheulean in Europe was replaced by a lithic technology known as the [[Mousterian Industry]], which was named after the site of [[Le Moustier]] in France, where examples were first uncovered in the 1860s. Evolving from the Acheulean, it adopted the [[Levallois technique]] to produce smaller and sharper knife-like tools as well as scrapers. Also known as the \"prepared core technique,\" flakes are struck from worked cores and then subsequently retouched. <ref>Clarke's \"flake tools from prepared cores.\"</ref> The Mousterian Industry was developed and used primarily by the [[Neanderthals]], a native European and Middle Eastern hominin species, but a broadly similar industry is contemporaneously widespread in Africa. <ref>{{Citation | last=Pettitt |first=Paul | year=2009 | contribution=The Rise of Modern Humans | title=The Human Past: World Prehistory and the Development of Human Societies | edition=2nd | editor-first=Chris | editor-last=Scarre | location=London | publisher=Thames and Hudson | pages=149\u2013151}}</ref>\n\n===Mode IV: The Aurignacian Industry===\nThe widespread use of long [[lithic blade|blade]]s (rather than flakes) of the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] Mode 4 industries appeared during the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago, although blades were still produced in small quantities much earlier by Neanderthals.<ref>{{cite book | last=Lewin | first=R. |last2=Foley |first2=R.

Mounting sharp flint edges in a wood or bone handle is the key innovation in microliths, essentially because the handle gives the user protection against the flint and also improves leverage of the device.\n\n===Neolithic industries===<!-- Template:Neolithic Europe links to this section -->\n[[Image:N\u00e9olithique 0001.jpg|thumb|left|An array of [[Neolithic]] artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools.]]\n[[File:Hache 222.1 Global fond.jpg|thumb|left|Polished Neolithic [[jadeitite]] axe from the [[:fr:Mus\u00e9um de Toulouse|Museum of Toulouse]]]]\n[[File:HMB Steinaxtmanufaktur Vinelz Jungsteinzeit 2700 BC.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Axe heads found at a 2700 BC Neolithic manufacture site in [[Switzerland]], arranged in the various stages of production from left to right.<br>Click to see individual images.]]\n\nIn prehistoric [[Japan]], ground stone tools appear during the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period, that lasted from around 40,000 BC to 14,000 BC.<ref>\"Prehistoric Japan, New perspectives on insular East Asia\", Keiji Imamura, University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, {{ISBN|0-8248-1853-9}}</ref>  Elsewhere, ground stone tools became important during the [[Neolithic]] period beginning about 10,000 BC. These ground or polished implements are manufactured from larger-grained materials such as [[basalt]], [[jade]] and [[jadeite]], [[Greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] and some forms of [[rhyolite]] which are not suitable for flaking. The greenstone industry was important in the [[English Lake District]], and is known as the [[Langdale axe industry]]. Ground stone implements included [[adze]]s, [[celt (tool)|celt]]s, and [[axe]]s, which were manufactured using a labour-intensive, time-consuming method of repeated grinding against an abrasive stone, often using water as a lubricant. Because of their coarse surfaces, some ground stone tools were used for grinding plant foods and were polished not just by intentional shaping, but also by use. [[Mano (stone)|Manos]] are hand stones used in conjunction with [[metate]]s for grinding corn or grain. Polishing increased the intrinsic [[mechanical strength]] of the axe. Polished stone axes were important for the widespread clearance of woods and forest during the Neolithic period, when crop and livestock farming developed on a large scale. They are distributed very widely and were traded over great distances since the best rock types were often very local. They also became venerated objects, and were frequently buried in [[long barrow]]s or [[round barrow]]s with their former owners.\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic]] period, large axes were made from flint [[nodule (geology)|nodule]]s by chipping a rough shape, a so-called \"rough-out\". Such products were traded across a wide area. The rough-outs were then polished to give the surface a fine finish to create the axe head. Polishing not only increased the final strength of the product but also meant that the head could penetrate wood more easily.\n[[File:Mar Dalan-Rawansar-Kermanshah.jpg|thumb|left|Small lunates from Epipaleolithic site of Mar Dalan, [[Rawansar]] , Kermanshah, Zagros]]\nThere were many sources of supply, including [[Grimes Graves]] in [[Suffolk]], [[Cissbury]] in [[Sussex]] and [[Spiennes]] near [[Mons]] in [[Belgium]] to mention but a few. In [[Great Britain|Britain]], there were numerous small quarries in [[downland]] areas where flint was removed for local use, for example.\n\nMany other rocks were used to make axes from stones, including the [[Langdale axe industry]] as well as numerous other sites such as [[Penmaenmawr]] and [[Tievebulliagh]] in [[Co Antrim]], [[Ulster]]. In Langdale, there many [[outcrop]]s of the [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] were exploited, and knapped where the stone was extracted. The sites exhibit piles of waste flakes, as well as rejected rough-outs. Polishing improved the [[mechanical strength]] of the tools, so increasing their life and effectiveness. Many other tools were developed using the same techniques. Such products were traded across the country and abroad.\n\n==Modern uses==\nThe invention of the [[flintlock]] gun mechanism in the sixteenth century produced a demand for specially shaped [[Flint#To ignite fire or gunpowder|gunflints]].<ref>Flayderman, 1998</ref>  The [[Flint#To ignite fire or gunpowder|gunflint]] industry survived until the middle of the twentieth century in some places, including in the English town of [[Brandon, Suffolk|Brandon]].<ref>Clarke, R (1935), The Flint-knapping Industry at Brandon, ''Antiquity'', vol.

Although stone tool-dependent societies and cultures still exist today, most stone tools are associated with [[prehistory|prehistoric]] (particularly [[Stone Age]]) cultures that have become extinct. [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] often study such prehistoric societies, and refer to the study of stone tools as [[lithic analysis]]. [[Ethnoarchaeology]] has been a valuable research field in order to further the understanding and cultural implications of stone tool use and manufacture.<ref>Sillitoe, P. and K. Hardy 2003 Living lithics: ethnoarchaeology in highland Papua New Guinea. Antiquity 77:555-566</ref>\n\nStone has been used to make a wide variety of different tools throughout history, including [[arrow heads]], spearpoints and [[querns]]. Stone tools may be made of either [[ground stone]] or [[chipped stone]], and a person who creates tools out of the latter is known as a [[flintknapper]].\n \nChipped stone tools are made from [[cryptocrystal]]line materials such as [[chert]] or [[flint]], [[radiolarite]], [[chalcedony]], [[obsidian]], [[basalt]], and  [[quartzite]] via a process known as [[lithic reduction]]. One simple form of reduction is to strike stone [[lithic flake|flake]]s from a nucleus (core) of material using a [[hammerstone]] or similar hard hammer fabricator. If the goal of the reduction strategy is to produce flakes, the remnant [[lithic core]] may be discarded once it has become too small to use. In some strategies, however, a [[flintknapper]] reduces the core to a rough [[uniface|unifacial]] or [[biface|bifacial]] [[Lithic reduction#Preform|preform]], which is further reduced using [[soft hammer]] flaking techniques or by [[pressure flaking]] the edges.\n\nMore complex forms of reduction include the production of highly standardized blades, which can then be fashioned into a variety of tools such as [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s, [[knife|knives]], [[sickle]]s and [[microliths]]. In general terms, chipped stone tools are nearly ubiquitous in all pre-metal-using societies because they are easily manufactured, the [[tool stone]] is usually plentiful, and they are easy to transport and sharpen.\n\n==Evolution==\n[[File:National park stone tools.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A selection of [[prehistoric]] stone tools]]\n\nArchaeologists classify stone tools into [[Industry (archaeology)|industries]] (also known as complexes or technocomplexes<ref name=\"Clarke 1978\">{{Cite book|title=Analytical Archaeology|last=Clarke|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1978|isbn=0231046308|edition=2nd|location=New York, NY|pages=372\u2013373}}</ref>) that share distinctive technological or morphological characteristics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dynamics of Learning in Neanderthals and Modern Humans Volume 1: Cultural Perspectives|last=Kadowaki|first=Seiji|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9784431545118|editor-last=Akazawa|editor-first=Takeru|location=Tokyo|pages=62\u201363|chapter=Issues of Chronological and Geographical Distributions of Middle and Upper Palaeolithic Cultural Variability in the Levant and Implications for the Learning Behaviour of Neanderthals and ''Homo sapiens''|editor-last2=Nishiaki|editor-first2=Yoshihiro|editor-last3=Aoki|editor-first3=Kenichi}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969 in the 2nd edition of ''World Prehistory'', [[Grahame Clark]] proposed an evolutionary progression of [[flint-knapping]] in which the \"dominant lithic technologies\" occurred in a fixed sequence from Mode 1 through Mode 5.<ref>{{cite book | first=Grahame |last=Clarke |title=World Prehistory: a New Outline | year=1969 |edition=2 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge |page=31}}</ref> He assigned to them relative dates: Modes 1 and 2 to the Lower [[Palaeolithic]], 3 to the [[Middle Palaeolithic]], 4 to the [[Upper Paleolithic|Advanced]] and 5 to the [[Mesolithic]]. They were not to be conceived, however, as either universal\u2014that is, they did not account for all [[lithic technology]]; or as synchronous\u2014they were not in effect in different regions simultaneously. Mode 1, for example, was in use in [[Europe]] long after it had been replaced by Mode 2 in [[Africa]].\n\nClark's scheme was adopted enthusiastically by the archaeological community. One of its advantages was the simplicity of terminology; for example, the Mode 1 / Mode 2 Transition. The transitions are currently of greatest interest. Consequently, in the literature the stone tools used in the period of the [[Palaeolithic]] are divided into four \"modes\", each of which designate a different form of complexity, and which in most cases followed a rough [[chronological]] order.\n\n===Pre-Mode I===\n;Kenya\nStone tools found from 2011 to 2014 at [[Lake Turkana]] in [[Kenya]], are dated to be 3.3 million years old, and predate the genus ''Homo'' by half million years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harmand|first=Sonia|last2=Lewis|first2=Jason E.|last3=Feibel|first3=Craig S.|last4=Lepre|first4=Christopher J.|last5=Prat|first5=Sandrine|last6=Lenoble|first6=Arnaud|last7=Bo\u00ebs|first7=Xavier|last8=Quinn|first8=Rhonda L.|last9=Brenet|first9=Michel|date=2015-05-20|title=3.3-million-year-old stone tools from Lomekwi 3, West Turkana, Kenya|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=521|issue=7552|pages=310\u2013315|doi=10.1038/nature14464|pmid=25993961|issn=0028-0836}}</ref> The oldest known ''Homo'' fossil is 2.8 million years old compared to the 3.3 million year old stone tools.<ref name='Morelle'>{{cite news |last=Morelle |first=Rebecca |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-32804177 |title=Oldest stone tools pre-date earliest humans |work=BBC News |date=20 May 2015 |accessdate=2016-01-03 }}</ref>  The stone tools may have been made by ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' or [[Kenyanthropus|''Kenyanthropus platyops'']]\u2014 (a 3.2 to 3.5-million-year-old [[Pliocene]] hominin fossil discovered in 1999) the species whose best fossil example is [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], which inhabited East Africa at the same time as the date of the oldest stone tools.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Wrong Turn Leads to Discovery of Oldest Stone Tools| url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150520-oldest-stone-tools-discovery-harmand-archaeology| website = National Geographic News| accessdate = 2015-05-21|first = Nadia| last = Drake| first2 = for National Geographic PUBLISHED May| last2 = 20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| title = 3.3-million-year-old stone tools from Lomekwi 3, West Turkana, Kenya| journal = Nature| date = May 21, 2015| issn = 0028-0836| pages = 310\u2013315| volume = 521| issue = 7552| doi = 10.1038/nature14464| first = Sonia| last = Harmand| first2 = Jason E.| last2 = Lewis| first3 = Craig S.| last3 = Feibel| first4 = Christopher J.|last4 = Lepre|first5 = Sandrine|last5 = Prat|first6 = Arnaud|last6 = Lenoble|first7 = Xavier|last7 = Bo\u00ebs|first8 = Rhonda L.|last8 = Quinn|first9 = Michel|last9 = Brenet| pmid=25993961}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title = The Oldest Stone Tools Yet Discovered Are Unearthed in Kenya| url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/oldest-known-stone-tools-unearthed-kenya-180955341/| accessdate = 2015-05-21| first = Helen| last = Thompson}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title = Stone Tools From Kenya Are Oldest Yet Discovered| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/science/stone-tools-from-kenya-are-oldest-yet-discovered.html| newspaper = The New York Times| date = 2015-05-20| access-date = 2015-05-30| issn = 0362-4331| first = John Noble| last = Wilford}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Oldest Known Stone Tools Discovered: 3.3 Million Years Old| url = http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/news/150520-stone-tools-discovery-vin| website = video.nationalgeographic.com| accessdate = 2015-06-15}}</ref> Dating of the tools was by dating volcanic ash layers in which the tools were found and dating the magnetic signature (pointing north or south due to reversal of the magnetic poles)  of the rock at the site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/how-a-disparate-team-found-the-worlds-oldest-tools|title=Nature Index|website=www.natureindex.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref>\n\n;Ethiopia\nGrooved, cut and fractured animal bone fossils, made by using stone tools, were found in [[Dikika]], [[Ethiopia]] near (200 yards) the remains of [[Selam (Australopithecus)|Selam]], a young ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' girl who lived about 3.3 million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Shannon P.

Grasping the proximal surface, the hominid brought the distal surface down hard on an object he wished to detach or shatter, such as a bone or tuber.\n\nThe earliest known Oldowan tools yet found date from 2.6&nbsp;million years ago, during the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] period, and have been uncovered at Gona in [[Ethiopia]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Semaw, S. |author2=M.

The Industry flourished in southern and eastern Africa between 2.6 and 1.7&nbsp;million years ago, but was also spread out of Africa and into [[Eurasia]] by travelling bands of ''H. erectus'', who took it as far east as [[Java]] by 1.8&nbsp;million years ago and [[North China (continent)|Northern China]] by 1.6&nbsp;million years ago.\n\n===Mode II: The Acheulean Industry===\n[[File:Biface (trihedral) Amar Merdeg, Mehran, Ilam, Lower Paleolithic, National Museum of Iran.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Biface (trihedral) from Amar Merdeg, Zagros foothills, Lower Paleolithic, National Museum of Iran]]\n[[Image:Hand axe spanish.gif|thumb|upright=1.25|A typical Acheulean handaxe; this example is from the Douro valley, [[Zamora (province)|Zamora]], Spain. The small chips on the edge are from reworking.]]\n{{Commons category|Acheulean}}\n{{Main|Acheulean Industry}}\n\nEventually, more complex, Mode 2 tools began to be developed through the [[Acheulean Industry]], named after the site of [[Saint-Acheul (Amiens)|Saint-Acheul]] in France. The Acheulean was characterised not by the core, but by the [[biface]], the most notable form of which was the [[hand axe]].<ref>Clarke's \"bifacially flaked hand axes.\"</ref> The Acheulean first appears in the archaeological record as early as 1.7&nbsp;million years ago in the [[Turkana District|West Turkana]] area of [[Kenya]] and contemporaneously in southern Africa.\n\nThe Leakeys, excavators at Olduvai, defined a \"Developed Oldowan\" Period in which they believed they saw evidence of an overlap in Oldowan and Acheulean. In their species-specific view of the two industries, Oldowan equated to ''H. habilis'' and Acheulean to ''H. erectus''. Developed Oldowan was assigned to ''habilis'' and Acheulean to ''erectus''. Subsequent dates on ''H. erectus'' pushed the fossils back to well before Acheulean tools; that is, ''H. erectus'' must have initially used Mode 1. There was no reason to think, therefore, that Developed Oldowan had to be ''habilis''; it could have been ''erectus''. Opponents of the view divide Developed Oldowan between Oldowan and Acheulean. There is no question, however, that ''habilis'' and ''erectus'' coexisted, as ''habilis'' fossils are found as late as 1.4 million years ago. Meanwhile, African ''H. erectus'' developed Mode 2. In any case a wave of Mode 2 then spread across Eurasia, resulting in use of both there. ''H. erectus'' may not have been the only hominin to leave Africa; European fossils are sometimes associated with ''[[Homo ergaster]]'', a contemporary of ''H. erectus'' in Africa.\n\nIn contrast to an Oldowan tool, which is the result of a fortuitous and probably [[ex tempore]] operation to obtain one sharp edge on a stone, an Acheulean tool is a planned result of a manufacturing process. The manufacturer begins with a blank, either a larger stone or a slab knocked off a larger rock. From this blank he or she removes large flakes, to be used as cores. Standing a core on edge on an anvil stone, he or she hits the exposed edge with centripetal blows of a hard hammer to roughly shape the implement. Then the piece must be worked over again, or retouched, with a soft hammer of wood or bone to produce a tool finely chipped all over consisting of two convex surfaces intersecting in a sharp edge. Such a tool is used for slicing; concussion would destroy the edge and cut the hand.\n\nSome Mode 2 tools are disk-shaped, others ovoid, others leaf-shaped and pointed, and others elongated and pointed at the distal end, with a blunt surface at the proximal end, obviously used for drilling. Mode 2 tools are used for butchering; not being composite (having no haft) they are not very appropriate killing instruments. The killing must have been done some other way. Mode 2 tools are larger than Oldowan. The blank was ported to serve as an ongoing source of flakes until it was finally retouched as a finished tool itself. Edges were often sharpened by further retouching.\n\n===Mode III: The Mousterian Industry===\n[[File:Nucl\u00e9us Levallois La-Parrilla.png|thumb|upright=1.25|A tool made by the [[Levallois technique]].

Evolving from the Acheulean, it adopted the [[Levallois technique]] to produce smaller and sharper knife-like tools as well as scrapers. Also known as the \"prepared core technique,\" flakes are struck from worked cores and then subsequently retouched. <ref>Clarke's \"flake tools from prepared cores.\"</ref> The Mousterian Industry was developed and used primarily by the [[Neanderthals]], a native European and Middle Eastern hominin species, but a broadly similar industry is contemporaneously widespread in Africa. <ref>{{Citation | last=Pettitt |first=Paul | year=2009 | contribution=The Rise of Modern Humans | title=The Human Past: World Prehistory and the Development of Human Societies | edition=2nd | editor-first=Chris | editor-last=Scarre | location=London | publisher=Thames and Hudson | pages=149\u2013151}}</ref>\n\n===Mode IV: The Aurignacian Industry===\nThe widespread use of long [[lithic blade|blade]]s (rather than flakes) of the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] Mode 4 industries appeared during the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago, although blades were still produced in small quantities much earlier by Neanderthals.<ref>{{cite book | last=Lewin | first=R. |last2=Foley |first2=R.

Such a technology makes much more efficient use of available materials like flint, although required greater skill in manufacturing the small flakes. Mounting sharp flint edges in a wood or bone handle is the key innovation in microliths, essentially because the handle gives the user protection against the flint and also improves leverage of the device.\n\n===Neolithic industries===<!-- Template:Neolithic Europe links to this section -->\n[[Image:N\u00e9olithique 0001.jpg|thumb|left|An array of [[Neolithic]] artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools.]]\n[[File:Hache 222.1 Global fond.jpg|thumb|left|Polished Neolithic [[jadeitite]] axe from the [[:fr:Mus\u00e9um de Toulouse|Museum of Toulouse]]]]\n[[File:HMB Steinaxtmanufaktur Vinelz Jungsteinzeit 2700 BC.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Axe heads found at a 2700 BC Neolithic manufacture site in [[Switzerland]], arranged in the various stages of production from left to right.<br>Click to see individual images.]]\n\nIn prehistoric [[Japan]], ground stone tools appear during the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period, that lasted from around 40,000 BC to 14,000 BC.<ref>\"Prehistoric Japan, New perspectives on insular East Asia\", Keiji Imamura, University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, {{ISBN|0-8248-1853-9}}</ref>  Elsewhere, ground stone tools became important during the [[Neolithic]] period beginning about 10,000 BC. These ground or polished implements are manufactured from larger-grained materials such as [[basalt]], [[jade]] and [[jadeite]], [[Greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] and some forms of [[rhyolite]] which are not suitable for flaking. The greenstone industry was important in the [[English Lake District]], and is known as the [[Langdale axe industry]]. Ground stone implements included [[adze]]s, [[celt (tool)|celt]]s, and [[axe]]s, which were manufactured using a labour-intensive, time-consuming method of repeated grinding against an abrasive stone, often using water as a lubricant. Because of their coarse surfaces, some ground stone tools were used for grinding plant foods and were polished not just by intentional shaping, but also by use. [[Mano (stone)|Manos]] are hand stones used in conjunction with [[metate]]s for grinding corn or grain. Polishing increased the intrinsic [[mechanical strength]] of the axe. Polished stone axes were important for the widespread clearance of woods and forest during the Neolithic period, when crop and livestock farming developed on a large scale. They are distributed very widely and were traded over great distances since the best rock types were often very local. They also became venerated objects, and were frequently buried in [[long barrow]]s or [[round barrow]]s with their former owners.\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic]] period, large axes were made from flint [[nodule (geology)|nodule]]s by chipping a rough shape, a so-called \"rough-out\". Such products were traded across a wide area. The rough-outs were then polished to give the surface a fine finish to create the axe head. Polishing not only increased the final strength of the product but also meant that the head could penetrate wood more easily.\n[[File:Mar Dalan-Rawansar-Kermanshah.jpg|thumb|left|Small lunates from Epipaleolithic site of Mar Dalan, [[Rawansar]] , Kermanshah, Zagros]]\nThere were many sources of supply, including [[Grimes Graves]] in [[Suffolk]], [[Cissbury]] in [[Sussex]] and [[Spiennes]] near [[Mons]] in [[Belgium]] to mention but a few. In [[Great Britain|Britain]], there were numerous small quarries in [[downland]] areas where flint was removed for local use, for example.\n\nMany other rocks were used to make axes from stones, including the [[Langdale axe industry]] as well as numerous other sites such as [[Penmaenmawr]] and [[Tievebulliagh]] in [[Co Antrim]], [[Ulster]]. In Langdale, there many [[outcrop]]s of the [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] were exploited, and knapped where the stone was extracted. The sites exhibit piles of waste flakes, as well as rejected rough-outs. Polishing improved the [[mechanical strength]] of the tools, so increasing their life and effectiveness. Many other tools were developed using the same techniques. Such products were traded across the country and abroad.\n\n==Modern uses==\nThe invention of the [[flintlock]] gun mechanism in the sixteenth century produced a demand for specially shaped [[Flint#To ignite fire or gunpowder|gunflints]].<ref>Flayderman, 1998</ref>  The [[Flint#To ignite fire or gunpowder|gunflint]] industry survived until the middle of the twentieth century in some places, including in the English town of [[Brandon, Suffolk|Brandon]].<ref>Clarke, R (1935), The Flint-knapping Industry at Brandon, ''Antiquity'', vol. IX</ref>\n\nFor specialist purposes [[Glass knife|glass knives]] are still made and used today, particularly for cutting [[thin section]]s for [[electron microscopy]] in a technique known as [[microtomy]]. Freshly cut blades are always used since the sharpness of the edge is very great. These knives are made from high-quality manufactured [[glass]], however, not from natural raw materials such as chert or obsidian. Surgical knives made from [[obsidian]] are still used in some delicate surgeries.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/lab/howto/protocols/glassknife.stm Glass Knife Making] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310060530/http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/lab/howto/protocols/glassknife.stm |date=2014-03-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Tool stone ==\n\nIn archaeology, a [[tool stone]] is a type of stone that is used to manufacture stone tools.
