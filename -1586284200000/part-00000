These highways are each designated Maryland Route X, where X is a number between 2 and 999. The highways are typically abbreviated MD X, although MD Route X and Route X are used less frequently. Because Maryland does not have a secondary route system or signed county route systems, all state highways are part of the main numerical system. That means the same set of numbers is used for both major highways and minor service roads, and almost every number has been used at one time or another.\n\nThe [[Maryland State Highway Administration]] constructs and maintains the vast majority of state highways in the 23 counties of Maryland. The [[Baltimore City Department of Transportation]] maintains all state highways within the city of Baltimore. Several towns and cities also maintain all or parts of the state highways within their boundaries. There are a few instances where a county department of transportation maintains sections of a state highway. Two unique situations are that [[Maryland Route 200|MD 200]] is maintained by the [[Maryland Transportation Authority]], which controls all of the publicly owned, tolled highways and bridges in the state, and part of [[Maryland Route 295|MD 295]], also known as the [[Baltimore&ndash;Washington Parkway]], is maintained by the [[National Park Service]] as a [[National Parkway]].\n\nMaryland applies letter suffixes to route numbers as a way of organizing groups of related highways, such as a group of old alignments of a major highway, a group of service roads related to the construction of a major highway, or a combination of both.  However, these letter suffixes are only used for inventory purposes and are never signed, with the exception of [[Maryland Route 835A|MD 835A]].  Since most routes with suffixes are very short highways of low importance, these highways are rarely signed with route markers.  However, there are several numbered highways with several disjoint segments whose segments are denoted internally with letter suffixes but the segments are signed with the same numerical route marker; examples of these highways include [[Maryland Route 7|MD 7]], [[Maryland Route 18|MD 18]], [[Maryland Route 144|MD 144]], [[Maryland Route 648|MD 648]], [[Maryland Route 675|MD 675]], and [[Maryland Route 765|MD 765]].\n\nThere is no duplication allowed between U.S. and Maryland state highways unless the two highways are related.  The only signed example of duplicate numbers is [[Maryland Route 222|MD 222]], which is the old alignment of [[U.S. Route 222|US 222]] before the latter was rolled back from [[Perryville, Maryland|Perryville]] to [[Conowingo, Maryland|Conowingo]].  Duplication of number is allowed between Interstate and Maryland state highways. [[Maryland State Route 795|MD 795]] is an unsigned short continuation of [[Interstate 795 in Maryland|I-795]]. Also, [[Maryland State Route 68|MD 68]] intersects [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] in close proximity to [[Interstate 68|I-68]] that signs are posted on I-70 advising drivers of the difference between the roads.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interstate 70 West - Washington County|url=http://www.aaroads.com/guide.php?page=i0070wcmd|website=AARoads|accessdate=August 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThis '''list of

Truck)}}\n|links=MD\n}}\n\nMaryland has an extensive system of state highways, exclusive of the national [[Interstate Highway|Interstate]] and [[U.S. Highway|U.S.]] highway systems, that serves all [[List of counties in Maryland|23 counties]] and the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[Baltimore]], almost every [[List of incorporated places in Maryland|incorporated city, town, and village]], and most [[List of census-designated places in Maryland|unincorporated place]]s in the state. These highways are each designated Maryland Route X, where X is a number between 2 and 999. The highways are typically abbreviated MD X, although MD Route X and Route X are used less frequently. Because Maryland does not have a secondary route system or signed county route systems, all state highways are part of the main numerical system. That means the same set of numbers is used for both major highways and minor service roads, and almost every number has been used at one time or another.\n\nThe [[Maryland State Highway Administration]] constructs and maintains the vast majority of state highways in the 23 counties of Maryland. The [[Baltimore City Department of Transportation]] maintains all state highways within the city of Baltimore. Several towns and cities also maintain all or parts of the state highways within their boundaries. There are a few instances where a county department of transportation maintains sections of a state highway. Two unique situations are that [[Maryland Route 200|MD 200]] is maintained by the [[Maryland Transportation Authority]], which controls all of the publicly owned, tolled highways and bridges in the state, and part of [[Maryland Route 295|MD 295]], also known as the [[Baltimore&ndash;Washington Parkway]], is maintained by the [[National Park Service]] as a [[National Parkway]].\n\nMaryland applies letter suffixes to route numbers as a way of organizing groups of related highways, such as a group of old alignments of a major highway, a group of service roads related to the construction of a major highway, or a combination of both.  However, these letter suffixes are only used for inventory purposes and are never signed, with the exception of [[Maryland Route 835A|MD 835A]].  Since most routes with suffixes are very short highways of low importance, these highways are rarely signed with route markers.  However, there are several numbered highways with several disjoint segments whose segments are denoted internally with letter suffixes but the segments are signed with the same numerical route marker; examples of these highways include [[Maryland Route 7|MD 7]], [[Maryland Route 18|MD 18]], [[Maryland Route 144|MD 144]], [[Maryland Route 648|MD 648]], [[Maryland Route 675|MD 675]], and [[Maryland Route 765|MD 765]].\n\nThere is no duplication allowed between U.S. and Maryland state highways unless the two highways are related.  The only signed example of duplicate numbers is [[Maryland Route 222|MD 222]], which is the old alignment of [[U.S. Route 222|US 222]] before the latter was rolled back from [[Perryville, Maryland|Perryville]] to [[Conowingo, Maryland|Conowingo]].  Duplication of number is allowed between Interstate and Maryland state highways. [[Maryland State Route 795|MD 795]] is an unsigned short continuation of [[Interstate 795 in Maryland|I-795]]. Also, [[Maryland State Route 68|MD 68]] intersects [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] in close proximity to [[Interstate 68|I-68]] that signs are posted on I-70 advising drivers of the difference between the roads.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interstate 70 West - Washington County|url=http://www.aaroads.com/guide.php?page=i0070wcmd|website=AARoads|accessdate=August 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThis '''list of

The city was named after lawyer [[Elbert Henry Gary]], who was the founding chairman of the United States Steel Corporation.\n\nGary was the site of civil unrest in the [[steel strike of 1919]]. On October 4, 1919, a riot broke out on Broadway, the main north\u2013south street through downtown Gary, between striking steel workers and strike breakers brought in from outside. Three days later, Indiana governor [[James P. Goodrich]] declared martial law. Shortly thereafter, over 4,000 federal troops under the command of Major General [[Leonard Wood]] arrived to restore order.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Hara|first=S.

[u.a.]|isbn=9780253222886}}</ref>\n\nThe jobs offered by the steel industry provided Gary with very rapid growth and a diverse population within the first 26 years of its founding. According to the [[1920 United States Census]], 29.7% of Gary's population at the time was classified as foreign-born, mostly from eastern European countries, with another 30.8% classified as native-born with at least one foreign-born parent. By the [[1930 United States Census]], the first census in which Gary's population exceeded 100,000, the city was the fifth largest in Indiana and comparable in size to [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], and [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]]. At that time, 78.7% of the population was classified as white, with 19.3% of the population was classified as foreign-born, and another 25.9% as native-born with at least one foreign-born parent. In addition to white internal migrants, Gary had attracted numerous African-American migrants from the South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], and 17.8% of the population was classified as black. 3.5% was classified as Mexican (now likely to be identified as Hispanic, as some were likely American citizens in addition to immigrants).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Steel city : urban and ethnic patterns in Gary, Indiana, 1906\u20131950|last=Mohl, Raymond A.|date=1986|publisher=Holmes & Meier|oclc=562497857}}</ref>\n\n===Post-World War II===\n[[File:U.S. STEEL PLANT - NARA - 547097 (retouched).jpg|thumb|left|[[U.S. Steel]]'s [[Gary Works]] in 1973]]\nGary's fortunes have risen and fallen with those of the steel industry. The growth of the steel industry brought prosperity to the community. Broadway was known as a commercial center for the region. Department stores and architecturally significant movie houses were built in the downtown area and the Glen Park neighborhood.\n\nIn the 1960s, like many other American urban centers reliant on one particular industry, Gary entered a spiral of decline. Gary's decline was brought on by the growing overseas competitiveness in the steel industry, which had caused U.S. Steel to lay off many workers from the Gary area. The U.S. Steel Gary Works employed over 30,000 in 1970, declined to just 6,000 by 1990, and further declined to 5,100 in August 2015. Attempts to shore up the city's economy with major construction projects, such as a [[Holiday Inn]] hotel and the [[Genesis Convention Center]], failed to reverse the decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sometimes-interesting.com/2013/06/08/the-abandoned-sheraton-hotel-of-gary-indiana/|title=The Sheraton Hotel of Gary, Indiana|date=2013-06-08|publisher=Sometimes Interesting}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/02/how-gary-indiana-got-serious-about-tackling-blight/386159/|title=How Gary, Indiana, Got Serious About Tackling Blight|author=Chris Bentley|date=2015-02-26|publisher=City Lab}}</ref>\n\nRapid racial change occurred in Gary during the late 20th century. These population changes resulted in political change which reflected the racial demographics of Gary: the non-white share of the city's population increased from 21% in 1930, 39% in 1960, to 53% in 1970. Non-whites were primarily restricted to live in the Midtown section just south of downtown (per the 1950 Census, 97% of the black population of Gary was living in this neighborhood). Gary had one of the nation's first African-American mayors, [[Richard G. Hatcher]], and hosted the ground-breaking 1972 National Black Political Convention.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Puente|first1=Michael|title=Gary's National Black Political Convention, 40 years on|url=https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/garys-national-black-political-convention-40-years-on/449ae089-207e-4547-b87d-844058c116d7|publisher=WBEZ|accessdate=October 7, 2016|date=March 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Gary had the highest percentage of African-Americans of U.S. cities with a population of 100,000 or more, 84% (as of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S. census]]). This no longer applies to Gary since the population of the city has now fallen well below 100,000 residents. As of 2013, the Gary Department of Redevelopment has estimated that one-third of all homes in the city are unoccupied and/or abandoned.<ref>{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date=November 2013 |title=Harper's Index |journal=[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]] |publisher=Harper's Foundation |volume=327 |issue=1,962 |page=17 |url=http://harpers.org/archive/2013/11/harpers-index-355/ |accessdate=December 30, 2013 }}{{subscription}}</ref>\n\nU.S. Steel continues to be a major steel producer, but with only a fraction of its former level of employment. While Gary has failed to reestablish a manufacturing base since its population peak, two casinos opened along the Gary lakeshore in the 1990s, although this has been aggravated by the state closing of [[Indiana State Road 912|Cline Avenue]], an important access to the area. Today, Gary faces the difficulties of a [[Rust Belt]] city, including unemployment, decaying infrastructure, and low literacy and educational attainment levels.\n\n===Recent history===\nGary has closed several of its schools within the last ten years.

This area contained mostly wood-frame houses, some of the earliest in the city, and became known in the 20th century for its ethnic populations from Europe and large families. The single-family houses had repeating house designs that alternated from one street to another, with some streets looking very similar. Among the East Side's most notable buildings were Memorial Auditorium (a large red-brick and stone civic auditorium and the site of numerous events, concerts and graduations), The Palace Theater, Emerson School, St. Luke's Church, H.C. Gordon & Sons, and Goldblatt's Department stores, in addition to the Fair Department Store. All fronted Broadway as the main street that divided Gary.\n\nThe West Side of Gary, or West of Broadway, the principal commercial street, had streets named after the presidents of the United States in order of their election. Lytton's, Hudson's ladies store, J.C. Penney, and Radigan Bros Furniture Store developed on the west side of Broadway. Developed later, this side of town was known for its masonry or brick residences, its taller and larger commercial buildings, including the Gary National Bank Building, Hotel Gary (now Genesis Towers), The Knights of Columbus Hotel & Building (now a seniors building fronting 5th Avenue), the Tivoli Theater (demolished), the U.S. Post Office, Main Library, Mercy and Methodist Hospitals and Holy Angels Cathedral and School. The West Side also had a secondary principal street, Fifth Avenue, which was lined with many commercial businesses, restaurants, theaters, tall buildings, and elegant apartment buildings. The West Side was viewed as having wealthier residents. The houses dated from about 1908 to the 1930s. Much of the West Side's housing were for executives of U.S. Steel and other prominent businessmen. Notable mansions were 413 Tyler Street and 636 Lincoln Street. Many of the houses were on larger lots. By contrast, a working-class area was made up of row houses made of poured concrete were arranged together and known as \"Mill Houses\"; they were built to house steel mill workers.\n\nThe areas known as Emerson and Downtown West combine to form Downtown Gary. It was developed in the 1920s and houses several pieces of impressive architecture, including the Moe House <!-- what is disputed about it? -->, designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and another, the [[Wilbur Wynant House|Wynant House]] (1917), which was destroyed by fire. A significant number of older structures have been demolished in recent years because of the cost of restoration. Restructuring of the steel and other heavy industry in the late 20th century resulted in a loss of jobs, adversely affecting the city.\n\nAbandoned buildings in the downtown area include historic structures such as [[Union Station (Gary, Indiana)|Union Station]], the [[Palace Theater (Gary, Indiana)|Palace Theater]], and [[City Methodist Church (Gary, Indiana)|City Methodist Church]]. A large area of the downtown neighborhood (including City Methodist) was devastated by a major fire on October 12, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.preserveindiana.com/mainpages/editorials.html#anchor461882 |title=Indiana Historic Architecture Editorials |publisher=Preserveindiana.com |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Blaze Hits Downtown Gary|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-10-13/news/9710140270_1_fire-buildings-senior-citizens|accessdate=April 24, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=October 13, 1997}}</ref> Interstate 90 was constructed between downtown Gary and the United States Steel plant.\n\n===West===\n[[Ambridge Mann]] is a neighborhood located on Gary's near west side along 5th Avenue. Ambridge was developed for workers at the nearby steel plant in the 1910s and 1920s. It is named after the American Bridge Works, which was a subsidiary of U.S. Steel. The neighborhood is home to a huge stock of prairie-style and art deco homes. The Gary Masonic Temple is located in the neighborhood, along with the Ambassador apartment building. Located just south of [[Interstate 90]], the neighborhood can be seen while passing Buchanan Street.\n\n[[File:Gary Centennial Landmark.jpg|thumb|Gary Centennial Landmark]]\n[[Brunswick (Gary)|Brunswick]] is located on Gary's far west side. The neighborhood is located just south of Interstate 90 and can also be seen from the expressway. The Brunswick area includes the Tri-City Plaza shopping center on West 5th Avenue (U.S. 20). The area is south of the [[Gary Chicago International Airport]].\n\n[[Downtown West (Gary)|Downtown West]] is located in north-central Gary on the west side of Broadway just south of [[Interstate 90]]. The [[Genesis Convention Center]], the [[Gary Police Department]], the Lake Superior Court House, and the Main Branch of the Gary Public Library are located along 5th Avenue. A new 123-unit mixed-income apartment development was built using a [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] Hope VI grant in 2006. The [[Adam Benjamin Metro Center]] is located just north of 4th Avenue. It is operated by the [[Gary Public Transportation Corporation]] and serves as a multi-modal hub. It serves both as the Downtown Gary South Shore train station and an intercity bus stop.\n\n[[Tolleston]] is one of Gary's oldest neighborhoods, predating much of the rest of the city. It was platted by George Tolle in 1857, when the railroads were constructed to this area. This area is west of Midtown and south of Ambridge Mann. Tarrytown is a subdivision located in Tolleston between Whitcomb Street and Clark Road.\n\n===South===\n[[Black Oak (Gary)|Black Oak]] is located on the far southwest side of Gary, in the vicinity of the Burr Street exit to the [[Borman Expressway]]. It was annexed in the 1970s. Prior to that, Black Oak was an unincorporated area informally associated with [[Hammond, Indiana|Hammond]], and the area has Hammond telephone numbers. After three referendums, the community voters approved annexation, having been persuaded by Mayor Hatcher that they would benefit more from services provided by the city than from those provided by the county. In the 20th-century, it is the only majority-white neighborhood in Gary.\n\n[[Glen Park (Gary)|Glen Park]] is located on Gary's far south side and is made up mostly of mid-twentieth-century houses. Glen Park is divided from the remainder of the city by the Borman Expressway. The northern portion of Glen Park is home to Gary's Gleason Park Golf Course and the campus of [[Indiana University Northwest]]. The far western portion of Glen Park is home to the Village Shopping Center. Glen Park includes the 37th Avenue corridor at Broadway.\n\n[[Midtown (Gary)|Midtown]] is located south of Downtown Gary, along Broadway. In the pre-1960s days of ''de facto'' segregation, this developed historically as a \"black\" neighborhood as African Americans came to Gary from the rural South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to seek jobs in the industrial economy.\n\n===North and East===\n[[File:Gary Indiana P9190219 Miller School (Dist 8).JPG|thumb|Old Miller School, District #8]]\n[[File:Wells Street Beach Miller Beach.JPG|thumb|Wells Street Beach in Miller]]\n[[Aetna (Gary)|Aetna]] is located on Gary's far east side along the [[Dunes Highway]]. Aetna predates the city of Gary. This [[company town]] was founded in 1881 by the Aetna Powder Works, an explosives company. Their factory closed after the end of World War&nbsp;I.\n\nThe Town of Aetna was annexed by Gary in 1928, around the same time that the city annexed the Town of Miller. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Gary's prosperous industries helped generate residential and other development in Aetna, resulting in an impressive collection of [[art deco]] architecture. The rest of the community was built after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, in a series of phases. On its south and east, Aetna borders the undeveloped floodplain of the [[Little Calumet River]].\n\n[[Emerson (Gary)|Emerson]] is located in north-central Gary on the east side of Broadway. Located just south of [[Interstate 90]], Gary City Hall is located in Emerson, along with the Indiana Department of Social Services building and the Calumet Township Trustee's office. A 6,000-seat minor league baseball stadium for the [[Gary SouthShore RailCats]], [[U.S. Steel Yard]], was constructed in 2002, along with contiguous commercial space and minor residential development.\n\n[[Miller Beach]], also known simply as Miller, is on Gary's far northeast side. Settled in the 1850s and incorporated as an independent town in 1907, Miller was annexed by the city of Gary in 1918. Miller developed around the old stagecoach stop and train station known by the 1850s as Miller's Junction and/or Miller's Station.\n\nMiller Beach is racially and economically diverse. It attracts investor interest due to the many year-round and summer homes within walking distance of [[Marquette Park (Gary)|Marquette Park]] and [[Lake Michigan]]. Prices for lakefront property are affordable compared to those in Illinois suburban communities. Lake Street provides shopping and dining options for Miller Beach visitors and residents. East Edge, a development of 28 upscale condominium, townhome, and single-family homes, began construction in 2007 at the eastern edge of Miller Beach along County Line Road, one block south of Lake Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.net/main.asp?SectionID=31&SubSectionID=146&ArticleID=26330 |title=It's Miller's time in Lake County|publisher=Indiana Economic Digest |date=April 16, 2006 |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe city is located at the southern end of the former lake bed of the prehistoric [[Lake Chicago]], and the current [[Lake Michigan]]. Most of the city's soil, to nearly one foot below the surface, is pure sand. The sand beneath Gary, and on its beaches, is of such volume and quality that for over a century companies have mined it, especially for the manufacture of glass.<ref>Detailed in n.a./n.d.

Weather varies yearly. In summer months Gary is humid. The city's yearly precipitation averages about 40&nbsp;inches. Summer is the rainiest season. Winters vary but are predominantly snowy. Snowfall in Gary averages approximately 25&nbsp;inches per year. Sometimes large blizzards hit because of \"[[lake effect snow]]\", a phenomenon whereby large amounts of water evaporated from the lake deposit onto the shoreline areas as inordinate amounts of snow.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Gary, Indiana\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  70\n|Feb record high F =  70\n|Mar record high F =  81\n|Apr record high F =  92\n|May record high F = 100\n|Jun record high F = 106\n|Jul record high F = 104\n|Aug record high F = 102\n|Sep record high F = 103\n|Oct record high F =  92\n|Nov record high F =  84\n|Dec record high F =  67\n|year record high F =106\n|Jan high F = 31.5\n|Feb high F = 35.2\n|Mar high F = 44.7\n|Apr high F = 58.4\n|May high F = 69.1\n|Jun high F = 79.6\n|Jul high F = 83.8\n|Aug high F = 82.5\n|Sep high F = 75.5\n|Oct high F = 64.6\n|Nov high F = 48.5\n|Dec high F = 35.8\n|year high F =59.1\n|Jan low F = 16.5\n|Feb low F = 19.9\n|Mar low F = 29.0\n|Apr low F = 40.0\n|May low F = 49.7\n|Jun low F = 59.9\n|Jul low F = 64.9\n|Aug low F = 63.9\n|Sep low F = 56.0\n|Oct low F = 45.7\n|Nov low F = 33.2\n|Dec low F = 21.9\n|year low F =41.7\n|Jan record low F = \u221222\n|Feb record low F = \u221210\n|Mar record low F =  \u22126\n|Apr record low F =  17\n|May record low F =  25\n|Jun record low F =  36\n|Jul record low F =  46\n|Aug record low F =  43\n|Sep record low F =  33\n|Oct record low F =  20\n|Nov record low F =  \u22121\n|Dec record low F = \u221217\n|year record low F= \u221222\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 1.8\n|Feb precipitation inch = 1.7\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.3\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.7\n|May precipitation inch = 3.8\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.5\n|Jul precipitation inch = 3.5\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.4\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.9\n|Oct precipitation inch = 2.6\n|Nov precipitation inch = 2.5\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.0\n|year precipitation inch=37.8\n|Jan snow inch = 7.8\n|Feb snow inch = 5.4\n|Mar snow inch = 3.0\n|Apr snow inch = 0.7\n|May snow inch = 0\n|Jun snow inch = 0\n|Jul snow inch = 0\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 0\n|Oct snow inch = 0.2\n|Nov snow inch = 1.7\n|Dec snow inch = 5.9\n|year snow inch =24.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.01 in\n|Jan precipitation days =  9\n|Feb precipitation days =  9\n|Mar precipitation days = 11\n|Apr precipitation days = 12\n|May precipitation days = 12\n|Jun precipitation days = 10\n|Jul precipitation days =  9\n|Aug precipitation days =  8\n|Sep precipitation days =  9\n|Oct precipitation days =  8\n|Nov precipitation days = 10\n|Dec precipitation days =  9\n|year precipitation days=116\n|source 1 = Weatherbase<ref name = weatherbase >\n{{cite web\n  |url = http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=89937&units=us\n  |title = Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Gary, Indiana\n  |publisher = Weatherbase\n  |accessdate = February 18, 2013\n}}</ref>\n|source 2 =<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idcide.com/weather/in/gary.htm |title=Gary Weather &#124; Gary IN &#124; Conditions, Forecast, Average |publisher=Idcide.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-22 |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905230404/http://www.idcide.com/weather/in/gary.htm |archive-date=September 5, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\nThe change in the economy and resulting loss of jobs has caused a drop in population by more than half since its peak in 1960. \n{{US Census population\n|1910= 16802\n|1920= 55378\n|1930= 100666\n|1940= 111719\n|1950= 133911\n|1960= 178320\n|1970= 175415\n|1980= 151968\n|1990= 116646\n|2000= 102746\n|2010= 80294\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=75282\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"U.S. Decennial Census\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 6, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412035529/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 12, 2013|df=mdy}}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\">{{cite web|title=Population Estimates|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the census<ref name=\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 12, 2020|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref> of 2010, there were 80,294 people, 31,380 households, and 19,691 families residing in the city.

The city was named after lawyer [[Elbert Henry Gary]], who was the founding chairman of the United States Steel Corporation.\n\nGary was the site of civil unrest in the [[steel strike of 1919]]. On October 4, 1919, a riot broke out on Broadway, the main north\u2013south street through downtown Gary, between striking steel workers and strike breakers brought in from outside. Three days later, Indiana governor [[James P. Goodrich]] declared martial law. Shortly thereafter, over 4,000 federal troops under the command of Major General [[Leonard Wood]] arrived to restore order.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Hara|first=S.

[u.a.]|isbn=9780253222886}}</ref>\n\nThe jobs offered by the steel industry provided Gary with very rapid growth and a diverse population within the first 26 years of its founding. According to the [[1920 United States Census]], 29.7% of Gary's population at the time was classified as foreign-born, mostly from eastern European countries, with another 30.8% classified as native-born with at least one foreign-born parent. By the [[1930 United States Census]], the first census in which Gary's population exceeded 100,000, the city was the fifth largest in Indiana and comparable in size to [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], and [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]]. At that time, 78.7% of the population was classified as white, with 19.3% of the population was classified as foreign-born, and another 25.9% as native-born with at least one foreign-born parent. In addition to white internal migrants, Gary had attracted numerous African-American migrants from the South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], and 17.8% of the population was classified as black. 3.5% was classified as Mexican (now likely to be identified as Hispanic, as some were likely American citizens in addition to immigrants).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Steel city : urban and ethnic patterns in Gary, Indiana, 1906\u20131950|last=Mohl, Raymond A.|date=1986|publisher=Holmes & Meier|oclc=562497857}}</ref>\n\n===Post-World War II===\n[[File:U.S. STEEL PLANT - NARA - 547097 (retouched).jpg|thumb|left|[[U.S. Steel]]'s [[Gary Works]] in 1973]]\nGary's fortunes have risen and fallen with those of the steel industry. The growth of the steel industry brought prosperity to the community. Broadway was known as a commercial center for the region. Department stores and architecturally significant movie houses were built in the downtown area and the Glen Park neighborhood.\n\nIn the 1960s, like many other American urban centers reliant on one particular industry, Gary entered a spiral of decline. Gary's decline was brought on by the growing overseas competitiveness in the steel industry, which had caused U.S. Steel to lay off many workers from the Gary area. The U.S. Steel Gary Works employed over 30,000 in 1970, declined to just 6,000 by 1990, and further declined to 5,100 in August 2015. Attempts to shore up the city's economy with major construction projects, such as a [[Holiday Inn]] hotel and the [[Genesis Convention Center]], failed to reverse the decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sometimes-interesting.com/2013/06/08/the-abandoned-sheraton-hotel-of-gary-indiana/|title=The Sheraton Hotel of Gary, Indiana|date=2013-06-08|publisher=Sometimes Interesting}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/02/how-gary-indiana-got-serious-about-tackling-blight/386159/|title=How Gary, Indiana, Got Serious About Tackling Blight|author=Chris Bentley|date=2015-02-26|publisher=City Lab}}</ref>\n\nRapid racial change occurred in Gary during the late 20th century. These population changes resulted in political change which reflected the racial demographics of Gary: the non-white share of the city's population increased from 21% in 1930, 39% in 1960, to 53% in 1970. Non-whites were primarily restricted to live in the Midtown section just south of downtown (per the 1950 Census, 97% of the black population of Gary was living in this neighborhood). Gary had one of the nation's first African-American mayors, [[Richard G. Hatcher]], and hosted the ground-breaking 1972 National Black Political Convention.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Puente|first1=Michael|title=Gary's National Black Political Convention, 40 years on|url=https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/garys-national-black-political-convention-40-years-on/449ae089-207e-4547-b87d-844058c116d7|publisher=WBEZ|accessdate=October 7, 2016|date=March 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Gary had the highest percentage of African-Americans of U.S. cities with a population of 100,000 or more, 84% (as of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S. census]]). This no longer applies to Gary since the population of the city has now fallen well below 100,000 residents. As of 2013, the Gary Department of Redevelopment has estimated that one-third of all homes in the city are unoccupied and/or abandoned.<ref>{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date=November 2013 |title=Harper's Index |journal=[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]] |publisher=Harper's Foundation |volume=327 |issue=1,962 |page=17 |url=http://harpers.org/archive/2013/11/harpers-index-355/ |accessdate=December 30, 2013 }}{{subscription}}</ref>\n\nU.S. Steel continues to be a major steel producer, but with only a fraction of its former level of employment. While Gary has failed to reestablish a manufacturing base since its population peak, two casinos opened along the Gary lakeshore in the 1990s, although this has been aggravated by the state closing of [[Indiana State Road 912|Cline Avenue]], an important access to the area. Today, Gary faces the difficulties of a [[Rust Belt]] city, including unemployment, decaying infrastructure, and low literacy and educational attainment levels.\n\n===Recent history===\nGary has closed several of its schools within the last ten years.

Originally, the City of Gary consisted of The East Side, The West Side, The South Side (the area south of the train tracks near 9th Avenue), and Glen Park, located further South along Broadway. The East Side was demarcated by streets named after the States in order of their acceptance into the Union. This area contained mostly wood-frame houses, some of the earliest in the city, and became known in the 20th century for its ethnic populations from Europe and large families. The single-family houses had repeating house designs that alternated from one street to another, with some streets looking very similar. Among the East Side's most notable buildings were Memorial Auditorium (a large red-brick and stone civic auditorium and the site of numerous events, concerts and graduations), The Palace Theater, Emerson School, St. Luke's Church, H.C. Gordon & Sons, and Goldblatt's Department stores, in addition to the Fair Department Store. All fronted Broadway as the main street that divided Gary.\n\nThe West Side of Gary, or West of Broadway, the principal commercial street, had streets named after the presidents of the United States in order of their election. Lytton's, Hudson's ladies store, J.C. Penney, and Radigan Bros Furniture Store developed on the west side of Broadway. Developed later, this side of town was known for its masonry or brick residences, its taller and larger commercial buildings, including the Gary National Bank Building, Hotel Gary (now Genesis Towers), The Knights of Columbus Hotel & Building (now a seniors building fronting 5th Avenue), the Tivoli Theater (demolished), the U.S. Post Office, Main Library, Mercy and Methodist Hospitals and Holy Angels Cathedral and School. The West Side also had a secondary principal street, Fifth Avenue, which was lined with many commercial businesses, restaurants, theaters, tall buildings, and elegant apartment buildings. The West Side was viewed as having wealthier residents. The houses dated from about 1908 to the 1930s. Much of the West Side's housing were for executives of U.S. Steel and other prominent businessmen. Notable mansions were 413 Tyler Street and 636 Lincoln Street. Many of the houses were on larger lots. By contrast, a working-class area was made up of row houses made of poured concrete were arranged together and known as \"Mill Houses\"; they were built to house steel mill workers.\n\nThe areas known as Emerson and Downtown West combine to form Downtown Gary. It was developed in the 1920s and houses several pieces of impressive architecture, including the Moe House <!-- what is disputed about it? -->, designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and another, the [[Wilbur Wynant House|Wynant House]] (1917), which was destroyed by fire. A significant number of older structures have been demolished in recent years because of the cost of restoration. Restructuring of the steel and other heavy industry in the late 20th century resulted in a loss of jobs, adversely affecting the city.\n\nAbandoned buildings in the downtown area include historic structures such as [[Union Station (Gary, Indiana)|Union Station]], the [[Palace Theater (Gary, Indiana)|Palace Theater]], and [[City Methodist Church (Gary, Indiana)|City Methodist Church]]. A large area of the downtown neighborhood (including City Methodist) was devastated by a major fire on October 12, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.preserveindiana.com/mainpages/editorials.html#anchor461882 |title=Indiana Historic Architecture Editorials |publisher=Preserveindiana.com |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Blaze Hits Downtown Gary|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-10-13/news/9710140270_1_fire-buildings-senior-citizens|accessdate=April 24, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=October 13, 1997}}</ref> Interstate 90 was constructed between downtown Gary and the United States Steel plant.\n\n===West===\n[[Ambridge Mann]] is a neighborhood located on Gary's near west side along 5th Avenue. Ambridge was developed for workers at the nearby steel plant in the 1910s and 1920s. It is named after the American Bridge Works, which was a subsidiary of U.S. Steel. The neighborhood is home to a huge stock of prairie-style and art deco homes. The Gary Masonic Temple is located in the neighborhood, along with the Ambassador apartment building. Located just south of [[Interstate 90]], the neighborhood can be seen while passing Buchanan Street.\n\n[[File:Gary Centennial Landmark.jpg|thumb|Gary Centennial Landmark]]\n[[Brunswick (Gary)|Brunswick]] is located on Gary's far west side. The neighborhood is located just south of Interstate 90 and can also be seen from the expressway. The Brunswick area includes the Tri-City Plaza shopping center on West 5th Avenue (U.S. 20). The area is south of the [[Gary Chicago International Airport]].\n\n[[Downtown West (Gary)|Downtown West]] is located in north-central Gary on the west side of Broadway just south of [[Interstate 90]]. The [[Genesis Convention Center]], the [[Gary Police Department]], the Lake Superior Court House, and the Main Branch of the Gary Public Library are located along 5th Avenue. A new 123-unit mixed-income apartment development was built using a [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] Hope VI grant in 2006. The [[Adam Benjamin Metro Center]] is located just north of 4th Avenue. It is operated by the [[Gary Public Transportation Corporation]] and serves as a multi-modal hub. It serves both as the Downtown Gary South Shore train station and an intercity bus stop.\n\n[[Tolleston]] is one of Gary's oldest neighborhoods, predating much of the rest of the city. It was platted by George Tolle in 1857, when the railroads were constructed to this area. This area is west of Midtown and south of Ambridge Mann. Tarrytown is a subdivision located in Tolleston between Whitcomb Street and Clark Road.\n\n===South===\n[[Black Oak (Gary)|Black Oak]] is located on the far southwest side of Gary, in the vicinity of the Burr Street exit to the [[Borman Expressway]]. It was annexed in the 1970s. Prior to that, Black Oak was an unincorporated area informally associated with [[Hammond, Indiana|Hammond]], and the area has Hammond telephone numbers. After three referendums, the community voters approved annexation, having been persuaded by Mayor Hatcher that they would benefit more from services provided by the city than from those provided by the county. In the 20th-century, it is the only majority-white neighborhood in Gary.\n\n[[Glen Park (Gary)|Glen Park]] is located on Gary's far south side and is made up mostly of mid-twentieth-century houses. Glen Park is divided from the remainder of the city by the Borman Expressway. The northern portion of Glen Park is home to Gary's Gleason Park Golf Course and the campus of [[Indiana University Northwest]]. The far western portion of Glen Park is home to the Village Shopping Center. Glen Park includes the 37th Avenue corridor at Broadway.\n\n[[Midtown (Gary)|Midtown]] is located south of Downtown Gary, along Broadway. In the pre-1960s days of ''de facto'' segregation, this developed historically as a \"black\" neighborhood as African Americans came to Gary from the rural South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to seek jobs in the industrial economy.\n\n===North and East===\n[[File:Gary Indiana P9190219 Miller School (Dist 8).JPG|thumb|Old Miller School, District #8]]\n[[File:Wells Street Beach Miller Beach.JPG|thumb|Wells Street Beach in Miller]]\n[[Aetna (Gary)|Aetna]] is located on Gary's far east side along the [[Dunes Highway]]. Aetna predates the city of Gary. This [[company town]] was founded in 1881 by the Aetna Powder Works, an explosives company. Their factory closed after the end of World War&nbsp;I.\n\nThe Town of Aetna was annexed by Gary in 1928, around the same time that the city annexed the Town of Miller. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Gary's prosperous industries helped generate residential and other development in Aetna, resulting in an impressive collection of [[art deco]] architecture. The rest of the community was built after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, in a series of phases. On its south and east, Aetna borders the undeveloped floodplain of the [[Little Calumet River]].\n\n[[Emerson (Gary)|Emerson]] is located in north-central Gary on the east side of Broadway. Located just south of [[Interstate 90]], Gary City Hall is located in Emerson, along with the Indiana Department of Social Services building and the Calumet Township Trustee's office. A 6,000-seat minor league baseball stadium for the [[Gary SouthShore RailCats]], [[U.S. Steel Yard]], was constructed in 2002, along with contiguous commercial space and minor residential development.\n\n[[Miller Beach]], also known simply as Miller, is on Gary's far northeast side. Settled in the 1850s and incorporated as an independent town in 1907, Miller was annexed by the city of Gary in 1918. Miller developed around the old stagecoach stop and train station known by the 1850s as Miller's Junction and/or Miller's Station.\n\nMiller Beach is racially and economically diverse. It attracts investor interest due to the many year-round and summer homes within walking distance of [[Marquette Park (Gary)|Marquette Park]] and [[Lake Michigan]]. Prices for lakefront property are affordable compared to those in Illinois suburban communities. Lake Street provides shopping and dining options for Miller Beach visitors and residents. East Edge, a development of 28 upscale condominium, townhome, and single-family homes, began construction in 2007 at the eastern edge of Miller Beach along County Line Road, one block south of Lake Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.net/main.asp?SectionID=31&SubSectionID=146&ArticleID=26330 |title=It's Miller's time in Lake County|publisher=Indiana Economic Digest |date=April 16, 2006 |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe city is located at the southern end of the former lake bed of the prehistoric [[Lake Chicago]], and the current [[Lake Michigan]]. Most of the city's soil, to nearly one foot below the surface, is pure sand. The sand beneath Gary, and on its beaches, is of such volume and quality that for over a century companies have mined it, especially for the manufacture of glass.<ref>Detailed in n.a./n.d.

At the northwesternmost section, Gary borders [[Hammond, Indiana|Hammond]] and [[East Chicago]]. [[Miller Beach]], its easternmost neighborhood, borders [[Lake Station, Indiana|Lake Station]] and [[Portage, Indiana|Portage]]. Gary's southernmost section borders [[Griffith, Indiana|Griffith]], [[Hobart, Indiana|Hobart]], [[Merrillville, Indiana|Merrillville]], and unincorporated [[Ross, Indiana|Ross]].

In July and August, the warmest months, high temperatures average 84&nbsp;\u00b0F (29&nbsp;\u00b0C) and peak just above 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C), and low temperatures average 63&nbsp;\u00b0F (17&nbsp;\u00b0C). In January and February, the coldest months, high temperatures average around 29&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22122&nbsp;\u00b0C) and low temperatures average 13&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221211&nbsp;\u00b0C), with at least a few days of temperatures dipping below 0&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nThe weather of Gary is greatly regulated by its proximity to [[Lake Michigan]]. Weather varies yearly. In summer months Gary is humid. The city's yearly precipitation averages about 40&nbsp;inches. Summer is the rainiest season. Winters vary but are predominantly snowy. Snowfall in Gary averages approximately 25&nbsp;inches per year. Sometimes large blizzards hit because of \"[[lake effect snow]]\", a phenomenon whereby large amounts of water evaporated from the lake deposit onto the shoreline areas as inordinate amounts of snow.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Gary, Indiana\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  70\n|Feb record high F =  70\n|Mar record high F =  81\n|Apr record high F =  92\n|May record high F = 100\n|Jun record high F = 106\n|Jul record high F = 104\n|Aug record high F = 102\n|Sep record high F = 103\n|Oct record high F =  92\n|Nov record high F =  84\n|Dec record high F =  67\n|year record high F =106\n|Jan high F = 31.5\n|Feb high F = 35.2\n|Mar high F = 44.7\n|Apr high F = 58.4\n|May high F = 69.1\n|Jun high F = 79.6\n|Jul high F = 83.8\n|Aug high F = 82.5\n|Sep high F = 75.5\n|Oct high F = 64.6\n|Nov high F = 48.5\n|Dec high F = 35.8\n|year high F =59.1\n|Jan low F = 16.5\n|Feb low F = 19.9\n|Mar low F = 29.0\n|Apr low F = 40.0\n|May low F = 49.7\n|Jun low F = 59.9\n|Jul low F = 64.9\n|Aug low F = 63.9\n|Sep low F = 56.0\n|Oct low F = 45.7\n|Nov low F = 33.2\n|Dec low F = 21.9\n|year low F =41.7\n|Jan record low F = \u221222\n|Feb record low F = \u221210\n|Mar record low F =  \u22126\n|Apr record low F =  17\n|May record low F =  25\n|Jun record low F =  36\n|Jul record low F =  46\n|Aug record low F =  43\n|Sep record low F =  33\n|Oct record low F =  20\n|Nov record low F =  \u22121\n|Dec record low F = \u221217\n|year record low F= \u221222\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 1.8\n|Feb precipitation inch = 1.7\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.3\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.7\n|May precipitation inch = 3.8\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.5\n|Jul precipitation inch = 3.5\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.4\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.9\n|Oct precipitation inch = 2.6\n|Nov precipitation inch = 2.5\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.0\n|year precipitation inch=37.8\n|Jan snow inch = 7.8\n|Feb snow inch = 5.4\n|Mar snow inch = 3.0\n|Apr snow inch = 0.7\n|May snow inch = 0\n|Jun snow inch = 0\n|Jul snow inch = 0\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 0\n|Oct snow inch = 0.2\n|Nov snow inch = 1.7\n|Dec snow inch = 5.9\n|year snow inch =24.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.01 in\n|Jan precipitation days =  9\n|Feb precipitation days =  9\n|Mar precipitation days = 11\n|Apr precipitation days = 12\n|May precipitation days = 12\n|Jun precipitation days = 10\n|Jul precipitation days =  9\n|Aug precipitation days =  8\n|Sep precipitation days =  9\n|Oct precipitation days =  8\n|Nov precipitation days = 10\n|Dec precipitation days =  9\n|year precipitation days=116\n|source 1 = Weatherbase<ref name = weatherbase >\n{{cite web\n  |url = http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=89937&units=us\n  |title = Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Gary, Indiana\n  |publisher = Weatherbase\n  |accessdate = February 18, 2013\n}}</ref>\n|source 2 =<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idcide.com/weather/in/gary.htm |title=Gary Weather &#124; Gary IN &#124; Conditions, Forecast, Average |publisher=Idcide.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-22 |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905230404/http://www.idcide.com/weather/in/gary.htm |archive-date=September 5, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\nThe change in the economy and resulting loss of jobs has caused a drop in population by more than half since its peak in 1960. \n{{US Census population\n|1910= 16802\n|1920= 55378\n|1930= 100666\n|1940= 111719\n|1950= 133911\n|1960= 178320\n|1970= 175415\n|1980= 151968\n|1990= 116646\n|2000= 102746\n|2010= 80294\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=75282\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"U.S. Decennial Census\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 6, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412035529/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 12, 2013|df=mdy}}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\">{{cite web|title=Population Estimates|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the census<ref name=\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 12, 2020|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref> of 2010, there were 80,294 people, 31,380 households, and 19,691 families residing in the city.
