Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations into her teens. Following high school graduation, she worked in a local bank and completed night classes at a college-level banking institute. After several years, Seely and several friends drove cross-country and moved to southern California. It was on the west coast that she rediscovered country music. Originally hired as a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs at the same label. Many of these songs would be recorded later by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a career. In Nashville, Seely recorded \"Don't Touch Me\" for [[Monument Records]] and had major success. She followed it with several more hits hits during the 1960s, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nStarting in the late 1960s, Seely collaborated on [[duet]] recordings with [[Jack Greene]]. The pair toured and had hits through the 1970s, including their biggest single \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\" (1970). Seely had further solo success during this time with the hits \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after a sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely started taking a more diverse career approach as she entered the 1980s. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays, and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'' which featured duets with several recording artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that incorporated [[bluegrass music]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of weekly broadcast of a [[Sirius XM]] country music radio program. \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A photograph of [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]].

Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years.

Seely had begun built a friendship with Dottie West. It was West who encouraged her to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to further her career.

Seely was also looking for a record label during this time, having been initially turned down by every record label in town; however Monument Records ultimately offered her a recording contract in early 1966. She was recording in the studio by March of that year. One of the first songs recorded was her husband's composition, \"[[Don't Touch Me]]\". Seely's recording became her first major chart success, peaking at the No. 2 position on the ''Billboard'' country singles charts, and stayed there for three weeks; on all the other major country charts (Cashbox, Record World), the song reached No. 1, and remained on the charts for over five months. The song climbed into the lower regions of the pop singles charts, peaking at No. 85. Because of the success of \"Don't Touch Me\", Seely was invited to perform on the ''Grand Ole Opry'' that June. She also won Billboard's, Cashbox's, and Record World's \"Most Promising Female Artist Award\". In March 1967, Seely won the Grammy award for ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"Don't Touch Me\", becoming only the third female country singer to win the award. That year, an album was released, titled ''[[The Seely Style]]'', which featured \"Don't Touch Me\". In September 1967, Seely joined the Grand Ole Opry, a lifelong dream of hers, where she became only the third woman to celebrate her fiftieth anniversary as a member on September 16, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|title=Members of the Grand Ole Opry: Jeannie Seely at Opry.com|website=Opry.com|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922052504/http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|archivedate=December 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"In 1966, Seely's '[[Don't Touch Me]]' took country women's sexuality from the [[honky-tonk]] into the bedroom even though it didn't end up there, and the on-again off-again ache in her voice retained its savor afterwards.

The song made the top 15 on the country charts at No. 15. The next year, Seely had two other top 40 country hits from her next album, ''Thanks! Hank'', one of which hit the Top 20, called \"A Wanderin' Man\". For the rest of the decade, Seely enjoyed only one other top 10 song, titled \"I'll Love You More (Than You'll Ever Need)\" in 1968. Another album released in 1968, titled ''Little Things'', produced a top-30 hit, \"Welcome Home to Nothing\". Seely stayed under Monument until late 1968, before switching to Decca records in 1969.\n\nFor several years she was married to [[Hank Cochran]], the writer of such songs as \"[[Make the World Go Away]]\", \"[[She's Got You]]\", \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\", \"The Chair\", and \"Ocean Front Property\". The marriage \u2013 the first for Seely but the fourth for Cochran \u2013 ended in a divorce.<ref name=webbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeannieseely.com/biography.cfm|title=Jeannie Seely Official Internet Home Page|website=Jeannieseely.com|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Success with Jack Greene in the 1970s and revitalizing her solo career===\nWhile moving over to Decca in 1969, Seely teamed up with fellow country star [[Jack Greene]]. Together they recorded a single (\"I Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\") and an album (''Jack Greene/Jeannie Seely''). Their single hit No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1970 and No. 1 on all the other major country charts, making the duo one of the most successful duet pairings of the early 1970s. Their road shows were also successful, and the duo performed at venues from New York's Madison Square Garden to London's Wembley Arena. In 1972, they released a new album, entitled ''Two for the Show''. Two singles from the album hit the top 20 on the country charts, starting with \"Much Oblige\", followed by \"What in the World Has Gone Wrong With Our Love\". The duo has been nominated for the [[CMA Awards]]' ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' as well as various Grammy award nominations. Together they toured for ten years performing everywhere from New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] to London's [[Wembley Arena]], most often in country music \"package shows\".\n\nA long list of artists \u2013 including [[Dottie West]], Norma Jean, [[Tex Williams]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], Jack Greene, [[Connie Smith]], and [[Doyle Lawson]] \u2013 have recorded compositions written by Seely. In 1972, [[Faron Young]] took \"Leavin\u2019 And Sayin\u2019 Goodbye\" to the No. 1 position in \"Record World\" on October 23, 1971, earning Seely a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Songwriter's Award.<ref name=webbio/>\n\nAfter being successfully paired with Greene, Seely saw the time to take note to revitalizing her career as a solo artist. In 1973, Decca became MCA records. Under MCA, she recorded a new album, titled ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'', the name of two singles to be released by Seely between 1973 and 1974. The first single was released in 1973, which was \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\". The song was well liked by Country radio, and peaked in the top 10 at No. 6, just missing the Top 5 spot. \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" was originally derived from an old hobo lament titled, [[\"May I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?\"]]. The follow-up to the top 10 came with \"Lucky Ladies\" in 1974, which came close to hitting the top 10, peaking in the top 15. \"Lucky Ladies\" was also derived from another song. Seely transformed an old Appalachian ballad titled \"[[Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies]]\" to \"Lucky Ladies\". While under MCA, Seely's material got more sexual and riskier like 1975's \"First Time\" and 1976's \"Since I Met You Boy\". In early 1977, Seely switched labels again, this time to Columbia records.\n\nAfter just getting started under a new record company, Seely was involved in a serious near-fatal automobile accident in 1977, which almost caused her career to come abruptly to an end. Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by [[Cathy Worthington]] in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. Her last record to hit the national charts came later that year, with the song \"Take Me to Bed\".\n\n===Later careers and life today===\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''[[Changing Hearts (film)|Changing Hearts]]'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]]. Fellow country singers and friends [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Jan Howard]] also appeared in the movie. In the fall of 2003 Seely released a new album, marketed towards [[bluegrass music]] and titled ''[[Life's Highway]]'', which received high critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today, Jeannie Seely still remains a member of the Grand Ole Opry and lives close by the Opry in a house by the Cumberland River that was renovated and decorated by Seely herself.\n\nOn May 3, 2010, Seely posted on her official Facebook page that she had lost her home along Nashville's Cumberland River, including car, clothes and personal possessions, as a result of the 2010 Nashville flood. Seely and her dog, Cheyenne, sought refuge at a friend's.\n\nCurrently, she is a DJ on Willie Nelson's XM Radio station Ch 59.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Seely married attorney Gene Ward.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nOn January 13, 2017, Jeannie Seely released a new album, her first in 6 years, titled ''\"[[Written in Song]]''\".

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations into her teens. Following high school graduation, she worked in a local bank and completed night classes at a college-level banking institute. After several years, Seely and several friends drove cross-country and moved to southern California. It was on the west coast that she rediscovered country music. Originally hired as a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs at the same label. Many of these songs would be recorded later by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a career. In Nashville, Seely recorded \"Don't Touch Me\" for [[Monument Records]] and had major success. She followed it with several more hits hits during the 1960s, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nStarting in the late 1960s, Seely collaborated on [[duet]] recordings with [[Jack Greene]]. The pair toured and had hits through the 1970s, including their biggest single \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\" (1970). Seely had further solo success during this time with the hits \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after a sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely started taking a more diverse career approach as she entered the 1980s. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays, and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'' which featured duets with several recording artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that incorporated [[bluegrass music]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of weekly broadcast of a [[Sirius XM]] country music radio program. \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A photograph of [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]].

Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years.

During the same period she began writing songs for [[Four Star Records|Four Star Music]].{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} As a songwriter, her songs were recorded by several country artists. One of the first vocalists to recorded a composition was [[Dottie West]] who cut the song \"It Just Take Practice\" for her 1965 album ''[[Dottie West Sings]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dottie West -- ''Dottie West Sings'' (1965, Vinyl) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Dottie-West-Sings/release/2211162 |website=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> The same year, [[Connie Smith]] recorded \"Senses\" which was co-written with [[Glen Campbell]].

Seely had built a friendship with Dottie West. It was West who encouraged her to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to further her career. At first, Seely was hesitant about leaving southern California.

Seely was also looking for a record label during this time, having been initially turned down by every record label in town; however Monument Records ultimately offered her a recording contract in early 1966. She was recording in the studio by March of that year. One of the first songs recorded was her husband's composition, \"[[Don't Touch Me]]\". Seely's recording became her first major chart success, peaking at the No. 2 position on the ''Billboard'' country singles charts, and stayed there for three weeks; on all the other major country charts (Cashbox, Record World), the song reached No. 1, and remained on the charts for over five months. The song climbed into the lower regions of the pop singles charts, peaking at No. 85. Because of the success of \"Don't Touch Me\", Seely was invited to perform on the ''Grand Ole Opry'' that June. She also won Billboard's, Cashbox's, and Record World's \"Most Promising Female Artist Award\". In March 1967, Seely won the Grammy award for ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"Don't Touch Me\", becoming only the third female country singer to win the award. That year, an album was released, titled ''[[The Seely Style]]'', which featured \"Don't Touch Me\". In September 1967, Seely joined the Grand Ole Opry, a lifelong dream of hers, where she became only the third woman to celebrate her fiftieth anniversary as a member on September 16, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|title=Members of the Grand Ole Opry: Jeannie Seely at Opry.com|website=Opry.com|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922052504/http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|archivedate=December 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"In 1966, Seely's '[[Don't Touch Me]]' took country women's sexuality from the [[honky-tonk]] into the bedroom even though it didn't end up there, and the on-again off-again ache in her voice retained its savor afterwards.

The song made the top 15 on the country charts at No. 15. The next year, Seely had two other top 40 country hits from her next album, ''Thanks! Hank'', one of which hit the Top 20, called \"A Wanderin' Man\". For the rest of the decade, Seely enjoyed only one other top 10 song, titled \"I'll Love You More (Than You'll Ever Need)\" in 1968. Another album released in 1968, titled ''Little Things'', produced a top-30 hit, \"Welcome Home to Nothing\". Seely stayed under Monument until late 1968, before switching to Decca records in 1969.\n\nFor several years she was married to [[Hank Cochran]], the writer of such songs as \"[[Make the World Go Away]]\", \"[[She's Got You]]\", \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\", \"The Chair\", and \"Ocean Front Property\". The marriage \u2013 the first for Seely but the fourth for Cochran \u2013 ended in a divorce.<ref name=webbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeannieseely.com/biography.cfm|title=Jeannie Seely Official Internet Home Page|website=Jeannieseely.com|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Success with Jack Greene in the 1970s and revitalizing her solo career===\nWhile moving over to Decca in 1969, Seely teamed up with fellow country star [[Jack Greene]]. Together they recorded a single (\"I Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\") and an album (''Jack Greene/Jeannie Seely''). Their single hit No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1970 and No. 1 on all the other major country charts, making the duo one of the most successful duet pairings of the early 1970s. Their road shows were also successful, and the duo performed at venues from New York's Madison Square Garden to London's Wembley Arena. In 1972, they released a new album, entitled ''Two for the Show''. Two singles from the album hit the top 20 on the country charts, starting with \"Much Oblige\", followed by \"What in the World Has Gone Wrong With Our Love\". The duo has been nominated for the [[CMA Awards]]' ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' as well as various Grammy award nominations. Together they toured for ten years performing everywhere from New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] to London's [[Wembley Arena]], most often in country music \"package shows\".\n\nA long list of artists \u2013 including [[Dottie West]], Norma Jean, [[Tex Williams]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], Jack Greene, [[Connie Smith]], and [[Doyle Lawson]] \u2013 have recorded compositions written by Seely. In 1972, [[Faron Young]] took \"Leavin\u2019 And Sayin\u2019 Goodbye\" to the No. 1 position in \"Record World\" on October 23, 1971, earning Seely a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Songwriter's Award.<ref name=webbio/>\n\nAfter being successfully paired with Greene, Seely saw the time to take note to revitalizing her career as a solo artist. In 1973, Decca became MCA records. Under MCA, she recorded a new album, titled ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'', the name of two singles to be released by Seely between 1973 and 1974. The first single was released in 1973, which was \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\". The song was well liked by Country radio, and peaked in the top 10 at No. 6, just missing the Top 5 spot. \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" was originally derived from an old hobo lament titled, [[\"May I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?\"]]. The follow-up to the top 10 came with \"Lucky Ladies\" in 1974, which came close to hitting the top 10, peaking in the top 15. \"Lucky Ladies\" was also derived from another song. Seely transformed an old Appalachian ballad titled \"[[Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies]]\" to \"Lucky Ladies\". While under MCA, Seely's material got more sexual and riskier like 1975's \"First Time\" and 1976's \"Since I Met You Boy\". In early 1977, Seely switched labels again, this time to Columbia records.\n\nAfter just getting started under a new record company, Seely was involved in a serious near-fatal automobile accident in 1977, which almost caused her career to come abruptly to an end. Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by [[Cathy Worthington]] in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. Her last record to hit the national charts came later that year, with the song \"Take Me to Bed\".\n\n===Later careers and life today===\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''[[Changing Hearts (film)|Changing Hearts]]'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]]. Fellow country singers and friends [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Jan Howard]] also appeared in the movie. In the fall of 2003 Seely released a new album, marketed towards [[bluegrass music]] and titled ''[[Life's Highway]]'', which received high critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today, Jeannie Seely still remains a member of the Grand Ole Opry and lives close by the Opry in a house by the Cumberland River that was renovated and decorated by Seely herself.\n\nOn May 3, 2010, Seely posted on her official Facebook page that she had lost her home along Nashville's Cumberland River, including car, clothes and personal possessions, as a result of the 2010 Nashville flood. Seely and her dog, Cheyenne, sought refuge at a friend's.\n\nCurrently, she is a DJ on Willie Nelson's XM Radio station Ch 59.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Seely married attorney Gene Ward.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nOn January 13, 2017, Jeannie Seely released a new album, her first in 6 years, titled ''\"[[Written in Song]]''\".

Fairplay fell to the floor, face first, unable to halt his fall with his hands due to the microphone he was holding.

There, he was pressured to swear an oath to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Alexius I Comnenus]], promising to give back any conquered land to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Although the other leaders did not intend to keep their oaths, Tancred refused to swear the oath altogether. He participated in the [[siege of Nicaea]] in 1097, but the city was taken by Alexius' army after secret negotiations with the [[Seljuk Turks]].

One year later, during the assault on [[Jerusalem]], Tancred, along with [[Gaston IV of B\u00e9arn]], claimed to have been the first [[Crusade]]r to enter the city on July 15. However, the first crusader to enter Jerusalem was Ludolf of Tournai, and he was followed by his brother Englebert. When the city fell, Tancred gave his banner to a group of the citizens who had fled to the roof of the [[Temple of Solomon]]. This should have assured their safety, but they were massacred, along with many others, during the sack of the city. The author of the ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' (Deeds of the Franks) records that, when Tancred realised this, he was \"greatly angered\".

He expanded the territory of the Latin principality by capturing land from the Byzantines, although, over the next decade, Alexius attempted, unsuccessfully, to bring him under Byzantine control.  In 1104, he also took control of the [[County of Edessa]] when [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] was taken captive after the [[Battle of Harran]]. After Baldwin's release in late 1108, he had to fight Tancred (probably early 1109) to regain control of the county; Tancred was eventually defeated and returned to Antioch. After Harran, Bohemond returned to Europe to recruit more Crusaders, again leaving his nephew as regent in [[Antioch]]. Tancred's victory over [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan|Radwan of Aleppo]] at the [[Battle of Artah]] in 1105 allowed the Latin principality to recover some its territories east of the [[Orontes River]].<ref>Smail, p. 28</ref>\n\nIn 1108, Tancred refused to honour the [[Treaty of Devol]], in which Bohemond swore an oath of fealty to Alexius, and for decades afterwards Antioch remained independent of the Byzantine Empire.  In 1110, he brought [[Krak des Chevaliers]] under his control, which would later become an important castle in the [[County of Tripoli]]. Tancred remained regent in Antioch in the name of [[Bohemond II of Antioch|Bohemond II]] until his death in 1112 during a [[typhoid]] epidemic. He had married [[Cecile of France]], but died childless.\n\nThe ''[[Gesta Tancredi]]'' is a biography of Tancred written in [[Latin language|Latin]] by [[Ralph of Caen]], a Norman who joined the First Crusade and served under Tancred and Bohemond. An English translation was co-published in 2005 by Bernard S. Bachrach and David S. Bachrach.\n\n[[Image:Tancred and Erminia.JPG|thumb|350px|right|[[Nicolas Poussin]]'s ''Tancred and Erminia'' ([[Hermitage Museum]])]]\n\n==In fiction==\nTancred appears as a character in [[Torquato Tasso]]'s 16th-century poem ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', in which he is portrayed as an epic hero and given a fictional love interest, the pagan warrior-maiden Clorinda. He is also loved by the Princess [[Erminia]] of Antioch. Portions of Tasso's verses were set by [[Claudio Monteverdi]] in his 1624 dramatic work ''[[Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda]]''. He also appears in one of the scenes in [[Imre Mad\u00e1ch]]'s ''[[Az ember trag\u00e9di\u00e1ja|The Tragedy of Man]]''. In [[Edwin Thomas (novelist)|Tom Harper]]'s ''Siege of Heaven'' he is depicted as a violent psychopath. His portrayal is similar although slightly more humorous in [[Alfred Duggan]]'s novel ''Count Bohemond''.\n\nTancred also appears as one of the Crusade leaders in Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[Count Robert of Paris]]'' who returned to [[Constantinople]] from [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Scutari]] to ensure a fair contest between Count Robert and his challenger. The novel ''[[Tancred (novel)|Tancred, or the New Crusade]]'' by [[Benjamin Disraeli]] centres around the adventures of an imagined modern descendant and namesake of the Prince of Galilee.

Rossini's opera ''[[Tancredi]]'' is based on Tasso, via [[Voltaire]]'s play ''Tancr\u00e8de'' of 1759.\n\n==References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Edwards, Robert W., ''The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Dumbarton Oaks Studies XXIII'', Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University (1987). {{ISBN|0-88402-163-7}}\n*Robert Lawrence Nicholson, ''Tancred: A Study of His Career and Work''.
