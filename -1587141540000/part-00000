[[History of the Philippines (900\u20131521)|Pre-colonial]] Filipinos often cooked or prepared their food with [[vinegar]] and salt to keep them fresh longer in the [[tropical]] climate of the Philippines. Vinegar, in particular, is one of the most important ingredients in Filipino cuisine, with four main traditional types: [[coconut vinegar]], [[cane vinegar]], [[nipa palm vinegar]], and [[kaong palm vinegar]], all of which are linked to traditional [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] [[fermentation]].<ref name=\"hosking\"/><ref name=\"Ponseca\"/>\n[[File:Chicken Adobo over rice.jpg|thumb|left|Chicken ''adobo'' on white [[rice]]]]\nThere are four main traditional cooking methods using vinegar that are still widely prevalent in the Philippines today: ''[[kinilaw]]'' (raw seafood in vinegar and spices), ''[[paksiw]]'' (a broth of meat with vinegar and spices), ''[[sangkutsa]]'' (pre-cooking meat by [[braising]] them in vinegar and spices), and finally ''adobo'' (a stew of vinegar, garlic, salt/soy sauce, and other spices).<ref name=\"asianjournal.wordpress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://asianjournal.wordpress.com/2008/07/14/adobo-a-history-of-the-countrys-national-dish/|title=ADOBO: A History of the Country's National Dish|date=14 July 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"rodell\"/><ref name=\"estrella\"/><ref name=\"hosking\"/> It is believed that ''paksiw'', ''sangkutsa'', and ''adobo'' were all derivations of ''kinilaw''.

Its function required to process data that was wirelessly transmitted to its sensors and make a decision based on the data received using its onboard computer about its output defined as its angular position and the timing of its firing mechanism. In  this model we can see all the elements of later concepts such as [[data processing]], [[automation]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cybernetics]], [[robotics]] etc.\n\n===Working on Director Studies===\nBode, in addition, applied  his extensive skills with feedback amplifiers to design the target data smoothing and position  predictor networks of an improved model of Director T-10, called the ''Director T-15''. The work on Director T-15 was undertaken under a new project at Bell Labs called ''Fundamental Director Studies'' in cooperation with the NDRC under the directorship of Walter McNair.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\nNDRC, the funding agency of this project, was operating under the aegis of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] ([[OSRD]]).<ref name=\"osrd\">{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/OSRD.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-22 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520212523/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/OSRD.html |archivedate=May 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nHis NDRC-funded research at Bell Labs under the section D-2 (Control Systems section) contract eventually led to other important developments in related fields and laid the cornerstone for many present-day inventions.  In the field of [[control theory]], for example, it  aided in the further development of servomechanism design and control, a crucial component of modern [[robotics]]. The development of Wireless Data Communications theory by Bode led to later inventions such as mobile phones and [[wireless networking]].\n\nThe reason for the new project was that Director T-10 encountered difficulties in calculating the target velocity by differentiating the target position. Due to [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]], variations and noise in the radar signal, the position [[derivative]]s sometimes fluctuated wildly and this caused erratic motion in the servomechanisms of the gun because their control signal was based on the value of the derivatives.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> This could be mitigated by smoothing or averaging out the data but this caused delays in the feedback loop that enabled the target to escape.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> As well, the algorithms of Director T-10 required a number of transformations from [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] (rectangular) to [[polar coordinates]] and back to Cartesian, a process that introduced additional tracking [[Approximation error|errors]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\nBode designed the [[velocity]] computing networks of Director T-15 by applying a [[finite difference method]] instead of [[Derivative|differentiation]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> Under this scheme the target positional [[coordinates]] were stored in a mechanical memory, usually a [[potentiometer]] or a [[cam]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> The velocity was then calculated by taking the difference between the coordinates of the current position and the coordinates of the previous reading that were stored in memory and dividing by the difference of their respective times.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> This method was more robust than the differentiation method and it also smoothed out signal disturbances since the finite time-step size was less sensitive to [[random]] [[Impulse response|signal impulses]] ([[Voltage spike|spikes]]).<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> It also introduced for the first time an algorithm better suited to modern [[Discrete signal|digital]] [[Digital signal processing|signal processing]] theory rather than to the classical [[Calculus]]-based [[analog signal processing]] approach that was followed then. Not coincidentally it is an integral part of modern digital control theory and digital signal processing and it is known as the backward difference algorithm.<ref name=\"backward difference\">[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BackwardDifference.html Eric W. Weisstein. \"Backward Difference.\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]</ref> In addition the Director T-15 operated only in rectangular coordinates thus eliminating [[Coordinate system#coordinate transformation|coordinate transformation]]-based errors. These design innovations paid performance dividends and the Director T-15 was twice as accurate as its predecessor and it converged on a target twice as fast.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\nThe fire control [[algorithm]] implementation of his artillery design research and his extensive work with feedback amplifiers advanced the state of the art in computational methods and led to the eventual development of the [[analog computer|electronic analog computer]],<ref name=\"analog comp.\">[http://dcoward.best.vwh.net/analog/ Analog Computer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208232216/http://dcoward.best.vwh.net/analog/ |date=February 8, 2006 }}</ref> the [[operational amplifier]] based alternative of today's [[digital computers]].\n\nInventions such as these, despite their military research origins, have had a profound and lasting impact in the civilian domain.\n\n===Military uses===\n\n====Anzio and Normandy====\nThe automated anti-aircraft guns that Bode helped develop were successfully used in numerous instances during the war. In February 1944 the automated fire control system, based on the earlier version of the Director T-15, called the Director T-10 by Bell Labs or Director M-9 by the military, saw action for the first time in [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]], Italy where it helped down over one hundred enemy aircraft. On [[D-day]] thirty nine units were deployed in [[operation Overlord|Normandy]] to protect the [[Allies of World War II|allied]] invading force against [[Hitler|Hitler's]] [[Luftwaffe]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\n====Use against the V-1 flying bomb====\nPerhaps the menace best suited for the design specifications of such an automated artillery system appeared in June 1944. Not surprisingly it was another robot. The German Aeronautical Engineers aided by [[Wernher von Braun]] produced a robot of their own; the [[V-1 flying bomb]], an automatically guided bomb and widely considered a precursor of the [[cruise missile]].<ref name=\"The Telegraph.\">[http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/yspace/articles/vonbraun.htm Germans at last learn truth about von Braun's 'space research' base.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228045555/http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/yspace/articles/vonbraun.htm |date=February 28, 2007 }} Article on [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] by Tony Paterson in Peenemunde, June 10, 2001 Quote: \"...missile research centre run by Wernher von Braun, who later worked on the American space programme...\" .

Retrieved January 14, 2009.</ref> Its flight specifications almost perfectly suited the target design criteria of Director T-10, that of an aircraft flying straight and level at constant velocity,<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> in other words a target nicely fitting the computing capabilities of a linear predictor model such as the Director T-10. Although the Germans did have a trick up their engineering sleeve by making the bomb fly fast and low to evade radar, a technique widely adopted even today. During the [[London Blitz]] one hundred Director T-10 assisted 90&nbsp;mm automated gun units were set up in a perimeter south of London, at the special request of [[Winston Churchill]]. The [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA]] units included the SCR-584 radar unit produced by the [[Radiation Lab]] at [[MIT]] and the proximity [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] mechanism, developed by [[Merle Tuve]] and his special ''Division T'' at NDRC,<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> that detonated near the target using a [[microwave]] controlled fuse called the VT or variable time fuse, enabling a larger detonation reach envelope and increasing the chances of a successful outcome. Between June 18 and July 17, 1944, 343 V-1 bombs were shot down or 10% of the total V-1 number sent by the Germans and about 20% of the total V-1 bombs shot down. From July 17 to August 31 the automated gun kills rose to 1286 V-1 rockets or 34%  of the total V-1 number dispatched from Germany and 50% of the V-1 actually shot down over London.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> From these statistics it can be seen that the automated systems that Bode helped design had a considerable impact on crucial battles of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Nelson2010\"/> It can also be seen that London at the time of the [[Blitzkrieg|Blitz]] became, among other things, the original robot [[battle]]field.\n\n===Synergy with Shannon===\nIn 1945, as the war was winding down, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as the prelude to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on Fire Control a special essay titled ''Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems'', coauthored by [[Ralph Beebe Blackman]], Hendrik Bode, and [[Claude Shannon]], formally introduced the problem of fire control as a special case of ''transmission, manipulation and utilization of intelligence'',<ref name=\"Mindell\"/><ref name=\"cybernetics in sov. union\"/> in other words it modeled the problem in terms of [[Data processing|data]] and [[signal processing]] and thus heralded the coming of the [[information age]]. Shannon, considered to be the father of [[information theory]], was greatly influenced by this work.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> It is clear that the [[technological convergence]]\nof the information age was preceded by the [[synergy]] between these scientific minds and their collaborators.\n\n===Further wartime achievements===\nIn 1944, Bode was placed in charge of the Mathematical Research Group at Bell Laboratories.<ref name=\"math group history\">[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/center/history.html Mathematical Research Group History] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130118060203/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/center/history.html |date=January 18, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nHis work on electronic communications, especially on filter and equalizer design,<ref name=\"filter design\">[http://www.rane.com/note122.html Equalizers]</ref>\ncontinued during this time.

Its function required to process data that was wirelessly transmitted to its sensors and make a decision based on the data received using its onboard computer about its output defined as its angular position and the timing of its firing mechanism. In  this model we can see all the elements of later concepts such as [[data processing]], [[automation]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cybernetics]], [[robotics]] etc.\n\n===Working on Director Studies===\nBode, in addition, applied  his extensive skills with feedback amplifiers to design the target data smoothing and position  predictor networks of an improved model of Director T-10, called the ''Director T-15''. The work on Director T-15 was undertaken under a new project at Bell Labs called ''Fundamental Director Studies'' in cooperation with the NDRC under the directorship of Walter McNair.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\nNDRC, the funding agency of this project, was operating under the aegis of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] ([[OSRD]]).<ref name=\"osrd\">{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/OSRD.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-22 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520212523/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/OSRD.html |archivedate=May 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nHis NDRC-funded research at Bell Labs under the section D-2 (Control Systems section) contract eventually led to other important developments in related fields and laid the cornerstone for many present-day inventions.  In the field of [[control theory]], for example, it  aided in the further development of servomechanism design and control, a crucial component of modern [[robotics]]. The development of Wireless Data Communications theory by Bode led to later inventions such as mobile phones and [[wireless networking]].\n\nThe reason for the new project was that Director T-10 encountered difficulties in calculating the target velocity by differentiating the target position. Due to [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]], variations and noise in the radar signal, the position [[derivative]]s sometimes fluctuated wildly and this caused erratic motion in the servomechanisms of the gun because their control signal was based on the value of the derivatives.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> This could be mitigated by smoothing or averaging out the data but this caused delays in the feedback loop that enabled the target to escape.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> As well, the algorithms of Director T-10 required a number of transformations from [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] (rectangular) to [[polar coordinates]] and back to Cartesian, a process that introduced additional tracking [[Approximation error|errors]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\nBode designed the [[velocity]] computing networks of Director T-15 by applying a [[finite difference method]] instead of [[Derivative|differentiation]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> Under this scheme the target positional [[coordinates]] were stored in a mechanical memory, usually a [[potentiometer]] or a [[cam]].<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> The velocity was then calculated by taking the difference between the coordinates of the current position and the coordinates of the previous reading that were stored in memory and dividing by the difference of their respective times.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> This method was more robust than the differentiation method and it also smoothed out signal disturbances since the finite time-step size was less sensitive to [[random]] [[Impulse response|signal impulses]] ([[Voltage spike|spikes]]).<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> It also introduced for the first time an algorithm better suited to modern [[Discrete signal|digital]] [[Digital signal processing|signal processing]] theory rather than to the classical [[Calculus]]-based [[analog signal processing]] approach that was followed then. Not coincidentally it is an integral part of modern digital control theory and digital signal processing and it is known as the backward difference algorithm.<ref name=\"backward difference\">[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BackwardDifference.html Eric W. Weisstein. \"Backward Difference.\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]</ref> In addition the Director T-15 operated only in rectangular coordinates thus eliminating [[Coordinate system#coordinate transformation|coordinate transformation]]-based errors. These design innovations paid performance dividends and the Director T-15 was twice as accurate as its predecessor and it converged on a target twice as fast.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/>\n\nThe fire control [[algorithm]] implementation of his artillery design research and his extensive work with feedback amplifiers advanced the state of the art in computational methods and led to the eventual development of the [[analog computer|electronic analog computer]],<ref name=\"analog comp.\">[http://dcoward.best.vwh.net/analog/ Analog Computer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208232216/http://dcoward.best.vwh.net/analog/ |date=February 8, 2006 }}</ref> the [[operational amplifier]] based alternative of today's [[digital computers]].\n\nInventions such as these, despite their military research origins, have had a profound and lasting impact in the civilian domain.\n\n===Military uses===\n\n====Anzio and Normandy====\nThe automated anti-aircraft guns that Bode helped develop were successfully used in numerous instances during the war. In February 1944 the automated fire control system, based on the earlier version of the Director T-15, called the Director T-10 by Bell Labs or Director M-9 by the military, saw action for the first time in [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]], Italy where it helped down over one hundred enemy aircraft.

Not surprisingly it was another robot. The German Aeronautical Engineers aided by [[Wernher von Braun]] produced a robot of their own; the [[V-1 flying bomb]], an automatically guided bomb and widely considered a precursor of the [[cruise missile]].<ref name=\"The Telegraph.\">[http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/yspace/articles/vonbraun.htm Germans at last learn truth about von Braun's 'space research' base.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228045555/http://cndyorks.gn.apc.org/yspace/articles/vonbraun.htm |date=February 28, 2007 }} Article on [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] by Tony Paterson in Peenemunde, June 10, 2001 Quote: \"...missile research centre run by Wernher von Braun, who later worked on the American space programme...\" .

Retrieved January 14, 2009.</ref> Its flight specifications almost perfectly suited the target design criteria of Director T-10, that of an aircraft flying straight and level at constant velocity,<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> in other words a target nicely fitting the computing capabilities of a linear predictor model such as the Director T-10. Although the Germans did have a trick up their engineering sleeve by making the bomb fly fast and low to evade radar, a technique widely adopted even today. During the [[London Blitz]] one hundred Director T-10 assisted 90&nbsp;mm automated gun units were set up in a perimeter south of London, at the special request of [[Winston Churchill]]. The [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA]] units included the SCR-584 radar unit produced by the [[Radiation Lab]] at [[MIT]] and the proximity [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] mechanism, developed by [[Merle Tuve]] and his special ''Division T'' at NDRC,<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> that detonated near the target using a [[microwave]] controlled fuse called the VT or variable time fuse, enabling a larger detonation reach envelope and increasing the chances of a successful outcome. Between June 18 and July 17, 1944, 343 V-1 bombs were shot down or 10% of the total V-1 number sent by the Germans and about 20% of the total V-1 bombs shot down. From July 17 to August 31 the automated gun kills rose to 1286 V-1 rockets or 34%  of the total V-1 number dispatched from Germany and 50% of the V-1 actually shot down over London.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> From these statistics it can be seen that the automated systems that Bode helped design had a considerable impact on crucial battles of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Nelson2010\"/> It can also be seen that London at the time of the [[Blitzkrieg|Blitz]] became, among other things, the original robot [[battle]]field.\n\n===Synergy with Shannon===\nIn 1945, as the war was winding down, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as the prelude to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on Fire Control a special essay titled ''Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems'', coauthored by [[Ralph Beebe Blackman]], Hendrik Bode, and [[Claude Shannon]], formally introduced the problem of fire control as a special case of ''transmission, manipulation and utilization of intelligence'',<ref name=\"Mindell\"/><ref name=\"cybernetics in sov. union\"/> in other words it modeled the problem in terms of [[Data processing|data]] and [[signal processing]] and thus heralded the coming of the [[information age]]. Shannon, considered to be the father of [[information theory]], was greatly influenced by this work.<ref name=\"Mindell\"/> It is clear that the [[technological convergence]]\nof the information age was preceded by the [[synergy]] between these scientific minds and their collaborators.\n\n===Further wartime achievements===\nIn 1944, Bode was placed in charge of the Mathematical Research Group at Bell Laboratories.<ref name=\"math group history\">[http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/center/history.html Mathematical Research Group History] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130118060203/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/center/history.html |date=January 18, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nHis work on electronic communications, especially on filter and equalizer design,<ref name=\"filter design\">[http://www.rane.com/note122.html Equalizers]</ref>\ncontinued during this time.

On the military side he continued pursuing ballistic missile research, including research on antiballistic missile defence and associated [[computing]] [[algorithms]], and in the civilian domain he concentrated on modern communication theory. On the post-war military research front he worked on the [[Project Nike|Nike Zeus]] missile project as part of a team with [[Douglas Aircraft]],<ref name=\"DayMcNeil2003\"/> and later on the design of [[anti-ballistic missile]]s.<ref name=Shearer>{{cite book|last=Shearer|first=Benjamin F.|title=Home front heroes: a biographical dictionary of Americans during wartime|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33420-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UJhx8H8XLnQC&pg=PA98&dq=Hendrik+Wade+Bode|pages=98\u201399}}</ref>\n\n===Retirement from Bell Labs===\nIn 1952, he was promoted to the level of Director of Mathematical Research at [[Bell Labs]].

The reorganisation is to be carried out in stages in 2016\u20132024. The concept of the plan is to make the most of the existing track network and to assume only minimal construction of new track. According to the plan, the 2/3 and 7A/7B loops will be changed to linear routes and a new, short, peak-time line number 5 from Katajanokka ferry terminal to the Central Railway Station will serve ferry passengers. J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari will be served by lines 7, 8 and 9, and line 6 will be routed to the new district of Hernesaari. The tramway to the new district of Kruunuvuorenranta over a new, kilometre-long bridge was left to be planned separately, as the design of that line is dependent on a number of other decisions, including whether to close down the Hanasaari coal-fired power plant. The ten lines in 2024 according to the plan are as follows<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hsl.fi/sites/default/files/uploads/linjasto_2024.pdf|title=Raitioliikenteen linjastosuunnitelma, kokonaiskartta, tilanne 2024|publisher=HSL|accessdate=2015-05-06}}</ref> (see reference for a map):\n\n#[[Eira]] \u2013 [[K\u00e4pyl\u00e4]]\n#[[Olympia Terminal]] \u2013 [[L\u00e4nsi-Pasila]]\n#[[Olympia Terminal]] \u2013 [[Meilahti]]\n#[[Katajanokka]] \u2013 [[Munkkiniemi]]\n#[[Katajanokka Ferry Terminal]] \u2013 [[Helsinki Central Station|Central Railway Station]]\n# (6T: [[West Harbour, Helsinki|West Ferry Terminal]]) - [[Hietalahti, Helsinki|Hietalahti]] \u2013 [[Arabianranta|Arabia]]\n#[[West Harbour, Helsinki|West Ferry Terminal]] \u2013 [[L\u00e4nsi-Pasila]]\n#[[J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari]] \u2013 [[Arabianranta|Arabia]]\n#[[J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari]] \u2013 [[Pasila]]\n#[[Kirurgi Hospital|Kirurgi]] \u2013 [[Pikku Huopalahti]]\n\n==Improvements to the connectivity and capacity of the network==\n\nA number of short segments of new track in areas already covered by the network are being planned in order to improve the connectivity and capacity of the network.\n\n===Topeliuksenkatu===\n\nThe planned tracks would run along Topeliuksenkatu from Runeberginkatu to Mannerheimintie, in parallel to the tramway on Mannerheimintie. This would provide additional capacity and a faster route in the direction of Mannerheimintie. The Topeliuksenkatu tramway is widely considered to be a requirement for further extensions of lines 4 and 10, which include the Munkkivuori extension. This tramway was one of the proposals in a 2006 study named \"{{lang|fr|Ratikka 2015}}\" (\"Tram 2015\").\n<ref name=\"misc12\" /><ref name=\"FTS45\">[[#noteFTS45|Finnish Tramway Society]]</ref><ref name=\"misc13\">[[#notemisc13|Kaupunkisuunnittelulautakunta]]</ref>\n\n===Fredrikinkatu===\n\nIn Kamppi the tracks on the north and south ends of Fredrikinkatu are separated by a {{convert|530|m|mile|sigfig=1|adj=on}} gap.  New tracks are planned along Fredrikinkatu between the junctions at Bulevardi (south end) and Malminrinne/Urho Kekkosen katu (north end) to connect this gap and provide a parallel north\u2013south connection to the congested main tramway along Mannerheimintie.\n\n==Extensions to new areas==\n\nThe opening of the [[Vuosaari Harbour]] in 2008 freed up harbour areas in J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari and Kalasatama near the city centre, as well as the oil terminal in Kruunuvuorenranta on the Laajasalo island, for development. A large rail yard in Pasila, which was used for handling freight rail traffic to J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari and Kalasatama, was also freed up. Helsinki is developing all four areas as new mixed-use urban districts, and in each case, the city decided to base the public transport in these areas on extensions to the tram network. (Pasila has a railway station that is served by all of the commuter trains, and Kalasatama has a metro station.)\n\n===J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari and Hernesaari===\n\nThe building of tramways in J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari has proceeded along with the construction of the buildings of the new district. The use of bi-directional trams was considered for the tramway extensions,<ref name=\"misc18\">[[#notemisc18|Antero Alku]]</ref> but in the end, HKL decided to build the tracks with conventional return loops and to dismantle temporary loops as necessary.\n\nAs of December 2017, only the final phase of the J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari tramways remains to be built, connecting the new ferry terminal in the southwestern corner of the island to the current return loop at Saukonpaasi (currently the terminus for lines 8 and 9). The completion of this stretch has been projected for 2025. In the previous phases, tracks were extended from Ruoholahti to Saukonpaasi (opened 1 January 2012), from Kamppi to the old ferry terminal (opened 13 August 2012), from the old to the new ferry terminal (opened February 2017) <ref>https://www.hel.fi/uutiset/fi/helsinki/lansisatama-uusi-terminaali</ref> and from J\u00e4tk\u00e4saarenlaituri along V\u00e4limerenkatu street to the return loop at Saukonpaasi (opened August 2017).\n\nVarious versions of the lines and routes to J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari have been proposed since the beginning of the planning.<ref name=\"misc12\">[[#notemisc12|Helsingin kaupungin liikennelaitos]]</ref><ref name=\"misc11\">[[#notemisc11|Helsingin kaupungin liikennelaitos]]</ref><ref name=\"JLK 2008-12-11\" /><ref name=\"Kslk 2007-1011\">[[#Kslk 2007-1011|Kaupunkisuunnittelulautakunta]]</ref><ref name=\"Haltia-Holmberg 2008-08-21\">[[#Haltia-Holmberg 2008-08-21|Mirva Haltia-Holmberg]]</ref> As of December 2017, lines 7, 8 and 9 are routed on J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari according to the plan approved in 2015 (see [[#reorganisation|Reorganisation]]).

By 2025, line 6 will be rerouted from its current termini at Hietalahti and the J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari ferry terminal to Hernesaari via Eiranranta.<ref name=\"JLK 2008-12-11\">[[#JLK 2008-12-11|Joukkoliikennelautakunta]]</ref><ref name=\"Haltia-Holmberg 2008-12-11\">[[#Haltia-Holmberg 2008-12-11|Mirva Haltia-Holmberg]]</ref> The stretch to Eiranranta is projected to be completed in 2018 and the extension to Hernesaari in 2024.\n\n===Kalasatama===\n\nThe construction of new housing in the former harbour area of Kalasatama began in 2011. Kalasatama is served by a metro station, and the city has not built tramways in advance of the housing in Kalasatama in the way it has done in J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari. At least two tram lines are planned to be extended into the Kalasatama area, one from the city centre in the south over new bridges (alignment to be decided), and one from the west from H\u00e4meentie.<ref name=\"FTS45\" /><ref name=\"KSVLaajasalo\">[[#KSVLaajasalo|Helsingin kaupunki: Kaupunkisuunnitteluvirasto]]</ref><ref name=\"misc9\">[[#notemisc9|Antero Alku]]</ref> As of May 2015, these are to be completed in 2021 and 2023 (see [[#funding|Funding plan]]).\n\n===Laajasalo===\n{{Main|Crown Bridges}}\n\nThe city council of Helsinki decided on 31 August 2016 to build a tramway to the island of [[Laajasalo]],<ref name=\"HSKruunu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kaupunki/a1472610018970|title=Helsingin kaupunginvaltuusto p\u00e4\u00e4tti: Kruunuvuorenrantaan rakennetaan Suomen pisin siltayhteys|publisher=Helsingin Sanomat|language=Finnish|accessdate=2016-08-31}}</ref> located to the east of Helsinki city centre.

However, in the first phase of construction, the northern part of the route was truncated into It\u00e4-Pasila in order to cut costs, while the southern terminus was placed in Kolmikulma due to opposition to tram tracks by people living along the planned new line.<ref name=\"misc18\"/> The connection to Ilmala in the north was planned in 2008 to be completed in 2013,<ref name=\"Haltia-Holmberg 2008-08-21\"/> but as of 2012, current projections have postponed the completion to 2017.\n\nAlthough shortly before the opening of line 9 HKL stated the continuation to Merikatu had been abandoned permanently,<ref name=\"misc19\">[[#notemisc19|Helsingin kaupungin liikennelaitos]]</ref> within weeks of the opening of the line, extending the route to Merikatu was again proposed, due to complaints from inhabitants of Ullanlinna following the termination of bus line 17.

The extension has been debated since the district was built in the 1950s. The bus lines that serve the area carry about 5 million passengers per year as of 2012, which is a sufficient ridership for a tram line. The bus lines have been criticised for being slow and having unpredictable running times. HSL collected comments from the public on several different alignment options in March and April 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsl.fi/FI/suunnittelu/raitioliikenne/Sivut/Munkkivuori.aspx|title=Munkkivuoren raitiotiet\u00e4 suunnitellaan kev\u00e4\u00e4ll\u00e4 2012|publisher=HRT|accessdate=2012-04-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405163101/http://www.hsl.fi/FI/suunnittelu/raitioliikenne/Sivut/Munkkivuori.aspx|archivedate=2012-04-05}}</ref> However, there is no decision on the funding or construction of the extension.\n\n==Trunk line 550 (\"Jokeri\")==\n\n{{Main|Jokeri light rail}}\n\nThe trunk bus line 550, formerly branded ''Jokeri'' (\"The Joker\", after '''Jo'''ukkoliikenteen '''ke'''h\u00e4m\u00e4inen '''r'''aide'''i'''nvestointi \u2013 \"A circular rail investment for public transportation\"), will be converted to light rail.

The [[Helsinki City Rail Loop]] is an underground loop of the commuter railway network that would distribute passengers to three new underground stations in central Helsinki. The proposal for after the city rail loop construction for surface traffic includes a new bus terminal at K\u00e4pyl\u00e4. Bus lines that currently continue to the city centre would terminate at the K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 station, where the passengers could make a connection to commuter trains or an extended tram line 1.\n\nIn addition to the above, expansion of the tram network from Arabia to [[Viikki]], K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 to [[Koskela]] and Pikku Huopalahti to [[Haaga]] have been mentioned as potential long-term projects.<ref name=\"FTS45\" />\n\nA construction of a light rail or tram system has also been proposed as a possible solution of arranging public transport in the [[\u00d6stersundom]] area [[Annexation|annexed]] by Helsinki from [[Vantaa]] and [[Sipoo]] on 1 January 2009. An extension of the [[Helsinki Metro]] was originally planned as the main form of public transport for this area, but on 20 February 2009 a newspaper reported that a light rail system is being studied as an alternative to supplement or replace the Metro connection to this area due to the lower costs of a light rail link.<ref name=\"Karjalainen\">[[#Karjalainen 2009-02-20|Marketta Karjalainen]]</ref><ref name=\"YLE 2009-06-25\">[[#YLE 2009-06-25|YLE]]</ref> If built, the light rail link could be extended as far east as [[Porvoo]].<ref name=\"YLE 2009-06-25\" /> \u00d6stersundom is located in eastern Helsinki, and as such the proposed new system would be completely unconnected with the currently existing tram system.

Existing tracks in dark green and grey.]]\nThe city of Helsinki has plans for a radical expansion of the tram network within the 2021\u20132035 time horizon, as laid out in the Helsinki City Plan, approved by the City Council in October 2016.<ref>http://www.yleiskaava.fi/en/city-plan/</ref> Below is a list of confirmed and proposed future expansions of the network. The largest confirmed projects are the {{convert|25|km|mi|adj=on}} trunk line 550 (\"Jokeri\") and the {{convert|10|km|mi|adj=on}} connection to the island of Laajasalo, which will include the longest bridge in Finland. Together, these two will effectively double the track length of the network.\n\n=={{anchor|reorganization}}Reorganisation of the tram lines==\n\nThe board of [[Helsingin seudun liikenne|HSL]] approved a plan for the reorganisation of the tram lines on 10 February 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hsl.fi/linjastosuunnitelmat/raitioliikenteen-linjastosuunnitelma|title=Raitioliikenteen linjastosuunnitelma|publisher=HSL|accessdate=2015-05-06}}</ref> The plan is meant to respond to the changing transportation needs as the new districts of the city in former brownfield sites (J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari, Hernesaari, Kalasatama, Keski-Pasila, Kruunuvuorenranta) are built. The reorganisation is to be carried out in stages in 2016\u20132024. The concept of the plan is to make the most of the existing track network and to assume only minimal construction of new track. According to the plan, the 2/3 and 7A/7B loops will be changed to linear routes and a new, short, peak-time line number 5 from Katajanokka ferry terminal to the Central Railway Station will serve ferry passengers. J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari will be served by lines 7, 8 and 9, and line 6 will be routed to the new district of Hernesaari. The tramway to the new district of Kruunuvuorenranta over a new, kilometre-long bridge was left to be planned separately, as the design of that line is dependent on a number of other decisions, including whether to close down the Hanasaari coal-fired power plant. The ten lines in 2024 according to the plan are as follows<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hsl.fi/sites/default/files/uploads/linjasto_2024.pdf|title=Raitioliikenteen linjastosuunnitelma, kokonaiskartta, tilanne 2024|publisher=HSL|accessdate=2015-05-06}}</ref> (see reference for a map):\n\n#[[Eira]] \u2013 [[K\u00e4pyl\u00e4]]\n#[[Olympia Terminal]] \u2013 [[L\u00e4nsi-Pasila]]\n#[[Olympia Terminal]] \u2013 [[Meilahti]]\n#[[Katajanokka]] \u2013 [[Munkkiniemi]]\n#[[Katajanokka Ferry Terminal]] \u2013 [[Helsinki Central Station|Central Railway Station]]\n# (6T: [[West Harbour, Helsinki|West Ferry Terminal]]) - [[Hietalahti, Helsinki|Hietalahti]] \u2013 [[Arabianranta|Arabia]]\n#[[West Harbour, Helsinki|West Ferry Terminal]] \u2013 [[L\u00e4nsi-Pasila]]\n#[[J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari]] \u2013 [[Arabianranta|Arabia]]\n#[[J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari]] \u2013 [[Pasila]]\n#[[Kirurgi Hospital|Kirurgi]] \u2013 [[Pikku Huopalahti]]\n\n==Improvements to the connectivity and capacity of the network==\n\nA number of short segments of new track in areas already covered by the network are being planned in order to improve the connectivity and capacity of the network.\n\n===Topeliuksenkatu===\n\nThe planned tracks would run along Topeliuksenkatu from Runeberginkatu to Mannerheimintie, in parallel to the tramway on Mannerheimintie. This would provide additional capacity and a faster route in the direction of Mannerheimintie. The Topeliuksenkatu tramway is widely considered to be a requirement for further extensions of lines 4 and 10, which include the Munkkivuori extension. This tramway was one of the proposals in a 2006 study named \"{{lang|fr|Ratikka 2015}}\" (\"Tram 2015\").\n<ref name=\"misc12\" /><ref name=\"FTS45\">[[#noteFTS45|Finnish Tramway Society]]</ref><ref name=\"misc13\">[[#notemisc13|Kaupunkisuunnittelulautakunta]]</ref>\n\n===Fredrikinkatu===\n\nIn Kamppi the tracks on the north and south ends of Fredrikinkatu are separated by a {{convert|530|m|mile|sigfig=1|adj=on}} gap.  New tracks are planned along Fredrikinkatu between the junctions at Bulevardi (south end) and Malminrinne/Urho Kekkosen katu (north end) to connect this gap and provide a parallel north-south connection to the congested main tramway along Mannerheimintie.\n\n==Extensions to new areas==\n\nThe opening of the [[Vuosaari Harbour]] in 2008 freed up harbour areas in J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari and Kalasatama near the city centre, as well as the oil terminal in Kruunuvuorenranta on the Laajasalo island, for development. A large rail yard in Pasila, which was used for handling freight rail traffic to J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari and Kalasatama, was also freed up. Helsinki is developing all four areas as new mixed-use urban districts, and in each case, the city decided to base the public transport in these areas on extensions to the tram network. (Pasila has a railway station that is served by all of the commuter trains, and Kalasatama has a metro station.)\n\n===J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari and Hernesaari===\n\nThe building of tramways in J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari has proceeded along with the construction of the buildings of the new district. The use of bi-directional trams was considered for the tramway extensions,<ref name=\"misc18\">[[#notemisc18|Antero Alku]]</ref> but in the end, HKL decided to build the tracks with conventional return loops and to dismantle temporary loops as necessary.\n\nAs of December 2017, only the final phase of the J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari tramways remains to be built, connecting the new ferry terminal in the southwestern corner of the island to the current return loop at Saukonpaasi (currently the terminus for lines 8 and 9). The completion of this stretch has been projected for 2025. In the previous phases, tracks were extended from Ruoholahti to Saukonpaasi (opened 1 January 2012), from Kamppi to the old ferry terminal (opened 13 August 2012), from the old to the new ferry terminal (opened February 2017) <ref>https://www.hel.fi/uutiset/fi/helsinki/lansisatama-uusi-terminaali</ref> and from J\u00e4tk\u00e4saarenlaituri along V\u00e4limerenkatu street to the return loop at Saukonpaasi (opened August 2017).\n\nVarious versions of the lines and routes to J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari have been proposed since the beginning of the planning.<ref name=\"misc12\">[[#notemisc12|Helsingin kaupungin liikennelaitos]]</ref><ref name=\"misc11\">[[#notemisc11|Helsingin kaupungin liikennelaitos]]</ref><ref name=\"JLK 2008-12-11\" /><ref name=\"Kslk 2007-1011\">[[#Kslk 2007-1011|Kaupunkisuunnittelulautakunta]]</ref><ref name=\"Haltia-Holmberg 2008-08-21\">[[#Haltia-Holmberg 2008-08-21|Mirva Haltia-Holmberg]]</ref> As of December 2017, lines 7, 8 and 9 are routed on J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari according to the plan approved in 2015 (see [[#reorganisation|Reorganisation]]).

By 2025, line 6 will be rerouted from its current termini at Hietalahti and the J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari ferry terminal to Hernesaari via Eiranranta.<ref name=\"JLK 2008-12-11\">[[#JLK 2008-12-11|Joukkoliikennelautakunta]]</ref><ref name=\"Haltia-Holmberg 2008-12-11\">[[#Haltia-Holmberg 2008-12-11|Mirva Haltia-Holmberg]]</ref> The stretch to Eiranranta is projected to be completed in 2018 and the extension to Hernesaari in 2024.\n\n===Kalasatama===\n\nThe construction of new housing in the former harbour area of Kalasatama began in 2011. Kalasatama is served by a metro station, and the city has not built tramways in advance of the housing in Kalasatama in the way it has done in J\u00e4tk\u00e4saari. At least two tram lines are planned to be extended into the Kalasatama area, one from the city centre in the south over new bridges (alignment to be decided), and one from the west from H\u00e4meentie.<ref name=\"FTS45\" /><ref name=\"KSVLaajasalo\">[[#KSVLaajasalo|Helsingin kaupunki: Kaupunkisuunnitteluvirasto]]</ref><ref name=\"misc9\">[[#notemisc9|Antero Alku]]</ref> As of May 2015, these are to be completed in 2021 and 2023 (see [[#funding|Funding plan]]).\n\n===Laajasalo===\n{{Main|Crown Bridges}}\n\nThe city council of Helsinki decided on 31 August 2016 to build a tramway to the island of [[Laajasalo]],<ref name=\"HSKruunu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kaupunki/a1472610018970|title=Helsingin kaupunginvaltuusto p\u00e4\u00e4tti: Kruunuvuorenrantaan rakennetaan Suomen pisin siltayhteys|publisher=Helsingin Sanomat|language=Finnish|accessdate=2016-08-31}}</ref> located to the east of Helsinki city centre.

However, in the first phase of construction, the northern part of the route was truncated into It\u00e4-Pasila in order to cut costs, while the southern terminus was placed in Kolmikulma due to opposition to tram tracks by people living along the planned new line.<ref name=\"misc18\"/> The connection to Ilmala in the north was planned in 2008 to be completed in 2013,<ref name=\"Haltia-Holmberg 2008-08-21\"/> but as of 2012, current projections have postponed the completion to 2017.\n\nAlthough shortly before the opening of line 9 HKL stated the continuation to Merikatu had been abandoned permanently,<ref name=\"misc19\">[[#notemisc19|Helsingin kaupungin liikennelaitos]]</ref> within weeks of the opening of the line, extending the route to Merikatu was again proposed, due to complaints from inhabitants of Ullanlinna following the termination of bus line 17.

The extension has been debated since the district was built in the 1950s. The bus lines that serve the area carry about 5 million passengers per year as of 2012, which is a sufficient ridership for a tram line. The bus lines have been criticised for being slow and having unpredictable running times. HSL collected comments from the public on several different alignment options in March and April 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsl.fi/FI/suunnittelu/raitioliikenne/Sivut/Munkkivuori.aspx|title=Munkkivuoren raitiotiet\u00e4 suunnitellaan kev\u00e4\u00e4ll\u00e4 2012|publisher=HRT|accessdate=2012-04-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405163101/http://www.hsl.fi/FI/suunnittelu/raitioliikenne/Sivut/Munkkivuori.aspx|archivedate=2012-04-05}}</ref> However, there is no decision on the funding or construction of the extension.\n\n==Trunk line 550 (\"Jokeri\")==\n\n{{Main|Jokeri light rail}}\n\nThe trunk bus line 550, formerly branded ''Jokeri'' (\"The Joker\", after '''Jo'''ukkoliikenteen '''ke'''h\u00e4m\u00e4inen '''r'''aide'''i'''nvestointi \u2013 \"A circular rail investment for public transportation\"), will be converted to light rail.

The [[Helsinki City Rail Loop]] is an underground loop of the commuter railway network that would distribute passengers to three new underground stations in central Helsinki. The proposal for after the city rail loop construction for surface traffic includes a new bus terminal at K\u00e4pyl\u00e4. Bus lines that currently continue to the city centre would terminate at the K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 station, where the passengers could make a connection to commuter trains or an extended tram line 1.\n\nIn addition to the above, expansion of the tram network from Arabia to [[Viikki]], K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 to [[Koskela]] and Pikku Huopalahti to [[Haaga]] have been mentioned as potential long-term projects.<ref name=\"FTS45\" />\n\nA construction of a light rail or tram system has also been proposed as a possible solution of arranging public transport in the [[\u00d6stersundom]] area [[Annexation|annexed]] by Helsinki from [[Vantaa]] and [[Sipoo]] on 1 January 2009. An extension of the [[Helsinki Metro]] was originally planned as the main form of public transport for this area, but on 20 February 2009 a newspaper reported that a light rail system is being studied as an alternative to supplement or replace the Metro connection to this area due to the lower costs of a light rail link.<ref name=\"Karjalainen\">[[#Karjalainen 2009-02-20|Marketta Karjalainen]]</ref><ref name=\"YLE 2009-06-25\">[[#YLE 2009-06-25|YLE]]</ref> If built, the light rail link could be extended as far east as [[Porvoo]].<ref name=\"YLE 2009-06-25\" /> \u00d6stersundom is located in eastern Helsinki, and as such the proposed new system would be completely unconnected with the currently existing tram system.

The team took to the court as the Hunters for the first time in October 2004, finishing second among seven teams in the Oligo Million tournament with a 4\u20133 record. During 2005 the team made it into post-season play with a record of 18 V12, but after a strong start the team faltered and finished in third place with one win and two losses. Although the Hunters missed the championship game, they won the respect and admiration of players and fans throughout Taiwan. During the summer break in 2005 Chou Hai-rong took the reins as head coach of the team, with Chung Chih-mong serving as technical advisor. The coaching adjustment is another step toward the goal of coming out on top in the second season of full play for the re-vamped SBL league.\n\n==Technical information==\nVideoland Channel are now available in satellite Singtel ST 1 at 88.0\u00b0E. presently all channels are free to air at this time both C-band and  three channels in Ku-band.
