{"title_page": "Gda\u0144sk crisis (1932)", "text_new": "The '''Gda\u0144sk crisis''' of 1932 was an incident between the [[Free City of Danzig]] (modern [[Gda\u0144sk]], Poland) and Poland concerning what the Polish government had the right to station warships in Danzig harbour together with Poland's claim to represent Danzig with foreign powers. The incident was sparked on 14 June 1932 when a squadron of British destroyers visited Danzig and was greeted by the Polish destroyer ''Wicher\u00a0'' which had entered Danzig harbour without the permission of the Senate of the Free City. The incident to the Danzig authorities reluctantly ceding the right of Poland to station its warships in Danzig, the renewal of the agreement governing Polish rights in the Free City and within Poland a shift towards navalism.\n\n==Background==\nThe American president [[Woodrow Wilson]] had issued a set of war aims known as the [[14 Points]] in January 1918. Point 13 called for the Polish independence to be restored after the war and for Poland to have \"secure access to the sea\", a statement that implied the German deep-water port of Danzig located at a strategical location where a branch of the river Vistula flowed into the Baltic Sea should become part of Poland. At the Paris peace conference in 1919, of the \"Big Three\" leaders, Wilson and the French premier [[Georges Cl\u00e9menceau]] supported the Polish claim to Danzig, but the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] was opposed under the grounds the population of Danzig was about 90% German. In a compromise, it was agreed that Danzig would become a Free City that would belong to neither Germany nor Poland, but the latter was to have  special rights in the city. Agreements such as the Paris convention of 1920 gave Poland certain rights with regards to the foreign relations of the Free City.{{sfn|Graczyk|2007|p=78-79}}\n\nOn the part of the Baltic coast that did become part of Poland, there were only two small fishing ports, [[Puck, Poland|Puck]] and [[Hel, Poland|Hel]], neither of which were suitable as naval bases. The most suitable port was Danzig, which was largely demilitarised under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The League of Nations, which possessed ultimate legal authority over Danzig suggested Poland use Danzig as a ''port d'attache'', where Poland would have the right to station warships, but not build any naval base to support the warships. On 8 October 1921, an agreement was signed giving Poland \u00a0''port d'attache'' rights in Danzig to be renewed every three years. Polish warships wintered in Danzig when the Baltic froze over and employed the shipwrights of the Free City to do repairs and maintenance work.{{sfn|Kondracki|2013|p=14-15}} The Polish Navy was very small in the 1920s, consisting mostly of former German torpedo boats.{{sfn|Zawadzki|1998|p=11}}\n\nIn March 1931, the Senate of the Free City unilaterally terminated Poland's ''port d'attache'' rights.{{sfn|Kondracki|2013|p=14-15}} The dispute was referred to the Council of the League of Nations, which in a ruling on 19 September 1931 decreed that both parties should take their dispute to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. On December 11, 1931 the Permanent Court of International Justice ruled that the existing contracts did not constitute grounds for stationing Polish warships in Danzig. The court suggested that the two sides settle the dispute themselves. On 1 May 1932, the Senate ruled that Polish Navy's warships could not enter Danzig if permission was first obtained from the Senate.{{sfn|Wandycz|1988|p=236}} The Free City had invited a group of Royal Navy destroyers to visit Danzig in June 1932, bringing tensions to the boil.{{sfn|Piaskowski|1984|p=7-10}} On 31 1932, the German chancellor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] was dismissed by President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and replaced with [[Franz von Papen]], a man most Germans had never heard of before.

The incident was sparked on 14 June 1932 when a squadron of British destroyers visited Danzig and was greeted by the Polish destroyer ''Wicher\u00a0'' which had entered Danzig harbour without the permission of the Senate of the Free City. The incident to the Danzig authorities reluctantly ceding the right of Poland to station its warships in Danzig, the renewal of the agreement governing Polish rights in the Free City and within Poland a shift towards navalism. \n==Background==\nThe American president [[Woodrow Wilson]] had issued a set of war aims known as the [[14 Points]] in January 1918. Point 13 called for the Polish independence to be restored after the war and for Poland to have \"secure access to the sea\", a statement that implied the German deep-water port of Danzig located at a strategical location where a branch of the river Vistula flowed into the Baltic Sea should become part of Poland. At the Paris peace conference in 1919, of the \"Big Three\" leaders, Wilson and the French premier [[Georges Cl\u00e9menceau]] supported the Polish claim to Danzig, but the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] was opposed under the grounds the population of Danzig was about 90% German. In a compromise, it was agreed that Danzig would become a Free City that would belong to neither Germany nor Poland, but the latter was to have  special rights in the city. Agreements such as the Paris convention of 1920 gave Poland certain rights with regards to the foreign relations of the Free City.{{sfn|Graczyk|2007|p=78-79}} \n\nOn the part of the Baltic coast that did become part of Poland, there were only two small fishing ports, [[Puck, Poland|Puck]] and [[Hel, Poland|Hel]], neither of which were suitable as naval bases. The most suitable port was Danzig, which was largely demilitarised under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The League of Nations, which possessed ultimate legal authority over Danzig suggested Poland use Danzig as a ''port d'attache'', where Poland would have the right to station warships, but not build any naval base to support the warships. On 8 October 1921, an agreement was signed giving Poland \u00a0''port d'attache'' rights in Danzig to be renewed every three years. Polish warships wintered in Danzig when the Baltic froze over and employed the shipwrights of the Free City to do repairs and maintenance work.{{sfn|Kondracki|2013|p=14-15}} The Polish Navy was very small in the 1920s, consisting mostly of former German torpedo boats.{{sfn|Zawadzki|1998|p=11}} \n\nIn March 1931, the Senate of the Free City unilaterally terminated Poland's ''port d'attache'' rights.{{sfn|Kondracki|2013|p=14-15}} The dispute was referred to the Council of the League of Nations, which in a ruling on 19 September 1931 decreed that both parties should take their dispute to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. On December 11, 1931 the Permanent Court of International Justice ruled that the existing contracts did not constitute grounds for stationing Polish warships in Danzig. The court suggested that the two sides settle the dispute themselves. On 1 May 1932, the Senate ruled that Polish Navy's warships could not enter Danzig if permission was first obtained from the Senate.{{sfn|Wandycz|1988|p=236}} The Free City had invited a group of Royal Navy destroyers to visit Danzig in June 1932, bringing tensions to the boil.{{sfn|Piaskowski|1984|p=7-10}} On 31 1932, the German chancellor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] was dismissed by President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and replaced with [[Franz von Papen]], a man most Germans had never heard of before.

Yoseloff|oclc=646869244}}</ref>\n\n== Detailed History ==\nThis regiment was composed principally of the hardy lumbermen of the Penobscot Valley and the eastern portion of the state, who were quick to respond to the first call to arms.  Before its organization it was made up of two battalions of five companies each, rendezvousing respectively at the state arsenal, [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], and [[Fort Sullivan (Maine)|Fort Sullivan]], [[Eastport, Maine|Eastport]].  Under a general order from Adjt.-Gen. Hodsdon, June 28, 1861, both battalions were removed to [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] and organized into a regiment for active service.  On July 12-15, 1861, it was mustered into the service of the United States and on the 17th left for [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].  En route through [[New York City]], the regiment was presented with a handsome standard by the sons of Maine in that city.  It arrived in Washington on the 19th and was stationed at [[Chain Bridge (Potomac River)|Chain Bridge]] on the [[Potomac River|Potomac]], where it remained until Sept. 3.  Through the fall and winter of 1861-62 it occupied Fort Griffin, and in March, 1862, was put into [[Winfield Scott Hancock|Hancock's]] brigade, [[William Farrar Smith|Smith's]] division, and joined in the advance on Manassas.  A little later it was attached to the [[IV Corps (Union Army)|4th Corps]] under Gen. [[Erasmus D. Keyes|E. D. Keyes]], and advanced with the rest of the army on Yorktown on April 4, 1862.  For the remainder of its three years the regiment saw the most arduous and active service.  It participated in ten general engagements and in a great many skirmishes.  On April 5-7, 1862, it was engaged in skirmishing and reconnaissances at the siege of Yorktown, and subsequently took part in the engagements at Lee's Mills, Williamsburg, Garnett's Farm, White Oak bridge, Antietam and Fredericksburg.  From Feb. 2 to May 11, 1863, it was with the \"Light Division\", and during this period took an honorable part in the Battle of Chancellorsville, where it lost 128 officers and men killed and wounded.  Other important battles in which the 6th was engaged were Rappahannock Station, where it lost 16 officers and 123 men; Wilderness, Spottsylvania Court House, where it lost a few men, and two days later in an attack on the enemy's works on the right, it lost 125 in killed, wounded and missing.  On June 12, 1864, the regiment only numbered 70 men, and was under fire for eight hours, supporting Gen. Hancock's corps, losing 16 officers and men.  The original members of the regiment were mustered out on Aug. 15, 1864, and the veterans and recruits to the number of 238 men, were transferred to the [[7th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|7th Me]]. afterwards organized as the [[1st Maine Veteran Volunteer Infantry Regiment|1st Regiment Veteran Volunteers]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/unionarmyhistory01madi|title=The Union army; a history of military affairs in the loyal states, 1861-65 -- records of the regiments in the Union army -- cyclopedia of battles -- memoirs of commanders and soldiers.

Yoseloff|oclc=646869244}}</ref>\n\n== Detailed History ==\nThis regiment was composed principally of the hardy lumbermen of the Penobscot Valley and the eastern portion of the state, who were quick to respond to the first call to arms.  Before its organization it was made up of two battalions of five companies each, rendezvousing respectively at the state arsenal, [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], and [[Fort Sullivan (Maine)|Fort Sullivan]], [[Eastport, Maine|Eastport]].  Under a general order from Adjt.-Gen. Hodsdon, June 28, 1861, both battalions were removed to [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] and organized into a regiment for active service.  On July 12-15, 1861, it was mustered into the service of the United States and on the 17th left for [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].  En route through [[New York City]], the regiment was presented with a handsome standard by the sons of Maine in that city.  It arrived in Washington on the 19th and was stationed at [[Chain Bridge (Potomac River)|Chain Bridge]] on the [[Potomac River|Potomac]], where it remained until Sept. 3.  Through the fall and winter of 1861-62 it occupied Fort Griffin, and in March, 1862, was put into [[Winfield Scott Hancock|Hancock's]] brigade, [[William Farrar Smith|Smith's]] division, and joined in the advance on Manassas.  A little later it was attached to the [[IV Corps (Union Army)|4th Corps]] under Gen. [[Erasmus D. Keyes|E. D. Keyes]], and advanced with the rest of the army on Yorktown on April 4, 1862.  For the remainder of its three years the regiment saw the most arduous and active service.  It participated in ten general engagements and in a great many skirmishes.  On April 5-7, 1862, it was engaged in skirmishing and reconnaissances at the siege of Yorktown, and subsequently took part in the engagements at Lee's Mills, Williamsburg, Garnett's Farm, White Oak bridge, Antietam and Fredericksburg.  From Feb. 2 to May 11, 1863, it was with the \"Light Division\", and during this period took an honorable part in the Battle of Chancellorsville, where it lost 128 officers and men killed and wounded.  Other important battles in which the 6th was engaged were Rappahannock Station, where it lost 16 officers and 123 men; Wilderness, Spottsylvania Court House, where it lost a few men, and two days later in an attack on the enemy's works on the right, it lost 125 in killed, wounded and missing.  On June 12, 1864, the regiment only numbered 70 men, and was under fire for eight hours, supporting Gen. Hancock's corps, losing 16 officers and men.  The original members of the regiment were mustered out on Aug. 15, 1864, and the veterans and recruits to the number of 238 men, were transferred to the [[7th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|7th Me]]. afterwards organized as the [[1st Maine Veteran Volunteer Infantry Regiment|1st Regiment Veteran Volunteers]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/unionarmyhistory01madi|title=The Union army; a history of military affairs in the loyal states, 1861-65 -- records of the regiments in the Union army -- cyclopedia of battles -- memoirs of commanders and soldiers.
