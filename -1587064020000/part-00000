It was later found out that his mother was adulterous, and Klaus' biological father was a werewolf, which makes Klaus the only original vampire-werewolf hybrid in existence. However, his werewolf powers were bound to the moonstone by a band of witches, which includes his mother. To release his werewolf powers a ritual, in which a werewolf, a vampire and a Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger have to be sacrificed, has to take place. The first Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger Klaus found was Katerina Petrova, but she escaped Klaus with the moonstone and hung herself in order to become a vampire so that she would be useless for the ritual. Klaus then wanted revenge on Katerina, causing her to spend centuries running from him.\n\nHundreds of years later, Klaus finds Katerina and Elena Gilbert, the next Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger, through Isobel Flemming. He kidnaps Katerina and makes her torture herself. After collecting the moonstone, a werewolf, Jules, the Petrova doppleg\u00e4nger, Elena, and turning Jenna Sommers into a vampire, he begins the ritual and his werewolf side is released. He later blackmails Stefan into helping him create more non-original werewolf-vampire hybrids, which he wants to create because he feels lonely, and turns him into a killer again. It is later revealed that he brought Stefan with him because they were once friends. After he finds out that he needs Elena's blood to create more non-original werewolf-vampire hybrids, he compels Stefan to stay in Mystic Falls to protect her, but also turns off his humanity. He also turns Tyler Lockwood into his first non-original werewolf-vampire hybrid. It is later found out that Klaus killed his own mother because she cast the spell on him that locked away his werewolf side and that therefore his step-father, Mikael, has been hunting him for centuries. After Damon un-daggers Elijah, who un-daggers Klaus' other half-siblings, and Bonnie Bennett and her mother are able to open up the tomb that holds Klaus' mother, Klaus is reunited with his entire family again. After saving Caroline Forbes' life by giving her his blood to heal her from Tyler's bite, he becomes interested in Caroline and invites her to the Original Vampires' ball, where they share a dance together. Bonnie later performs a desiccation spell to neutralize him, but he is later staked to death by Alaric. However, it is revealed that Bonnie cast a spell allowing him to inhabit Tyler's body. Thus forcing Tyler to leave his body. Then in the next season, Klaus forces Bonnie to put him back into his own body.\n\nAfter numerous near-death experiences, Klaus Mikaelson falls in love with the vampire Caroline Forbes and begins to court her. After many seasons it is revealed in 5x11 that Caroline feels much the same and they share an afternoon together consummating their feelings.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nKlaus must deal with a series of betrayals, personal growth, and the meaning of family in The Originals.\n\nKlaus is drawn back to the French Quarter of [[New Orleans]], a city he founded, and one he considered one of his best and greatest achievements before he was forced to flee from his step father's arrival. The group of witches who recalled him to the city inform Klaus that Hayley Marshall is carrying his unborn child, and make a deal with him: overthrow Marcel, the vampire king of New Orleans, in exchange for his unborn child's safety. Klaus, Marcel's sire and former adoptive family, had believed Marcel had been murdered and mourned him for years, while Marcel chose to use Klaus's absence to take the city for his own, instead of seeking the Originals out and rejoining their family. Klaus is devastated by this betrayal and theft, and vows to remove Marcel and retake the city.\n\nKlaus began life as a sensitive and artistic child who was singled out from all of his siblings by his father for the most horrific abuse. Even before the revelation of his mother's affair and Klaus's bastard status, Klaus was treated to extreme violence at the hands of the one he called father. As such, Klaus has very mixed feelings about his own child, and his future role as father, but eventually vows to protect Hayley and their baby no matter what and break the cycle of fatherly violence. Hayley and Klaus have no intention of rekindling what had been a one-night stand, but remain on amiable, if sometimes tense, terms, and Klaus has a tendency to be mildly possessive of Hayley and jealous of her affections for his brother, Elijah.\n\nKlaus becomes friends with Camille, a human bartender and grad student studying psychology. Camille has an understanding of Klaus's complexity, and is unafraid to call Klaus out on his rash behavior. Klaus treats her as a sort of confidant, and begins to see and unravel some of his destructive patterns.\n\nKlaus is extremely manipulative, and quick to use the most complex and devious of means to strong arm and force people to give him his way, believing they will always follow their most base, and selfish urges. This, combined with his paranoia, ease with violence, and tendency to be extremely controlling of those he actually likes, ensure that few of Klaus's good intentions ever turn out well or are perceived as good.\n\nRebekah, Klaus's younger sister and favorite, most-trusted sibling, betrays Klaus in a way he is not sure he can forgive, and deal with his elder brother, Elijah, trying to control and fetter him 'for his own good'. Klaus must also handle the betrayal of Marcel, whom he long thought of as a son, choosing to believe Klaus is a monster in need of vanquishing, and whom Klaus can never bring himself to kill.\n\nKlaus realizes that his scheming earns him numerous enemies, and he must pay the price once his daughter is born and those enemies wish to harm her. Klaus adores his child and swears to level all of his enemies who wish to harm her so that she can safely live with him.\n\nKlaus also discovers the werewolf half of his family line still exists, and must decide how to approach a relationship with them, and balance their needs with those of his vampire family, since werewolves and vampires are natural enemies and helping one is perceived as a threat to the other.\n\nIn the final episodes, Klaus transfers the Hollow into himself in order to save his daughter Hope with the plan to commit suicide using a white oak stake he has secretly kept for decades to destroy the Hollow and ensure the safety of his loved ones. After saying goodbye to those he cares about most, including Caroline, Klaus and Elijah, who decides to die with his brother, stake each other.\n\n====Powers and Abilities====\nAs the Original Hybrid, Klaus is the strongest of the Original vampires due to his Werewolf heritage giving him additional powers and advantages his half-siblings do not possess, making him the most physically powerful immortal being in the world, second only to Marcel Gerard. Klaus will grow stronger and faster when he is using his lycanthrope enhancements. His strength and speed will also increase during a full moon. His powers, including his strength and speed will be at their peak in his Werewolf form due to his werewolf heritage.\n\nIn Klaus's confrontations against the-then Enhanced Original Vampire Alaric Saltzman, his step-father Mikael, and the Upgraded Original Vampires Lucien Castle and Marcel Gerard respectively, the latters are apparently proven to be physically stronger than Klaus, however, in each of these confrontations, the Original Hybrid never truly used his full strength, as his physical attributes (such as strength and speed) are at their peaks when he is fully transformed into his werewolf form. It's possible that if Klaus were to transform into his Werewolf form, he might of been able to match Lucien, when he was still the Beast, in terms of speed.\n\nAlthough stronger than his Original Vampire maternal half-siblings due to his Werewolf heritage, some of his siblings like Elijah and Kol have displayed the ability to fight Klaus on almost equal terms, though not enough to defeat him as the latter always turns the tables with the use of his superior powers or skills. Both Elijah and Kol have been able to fight Klaus to a stalemate though unlike Kol, Elijah has been able to defeat Klaus once, whilst Rebekah has been easily subdued, though unlike Elija and Kol, Rebekah very rarely fights back. \n\nKlaus has shown to be an expert fighter such as when Marcel's army took him on, despite being overwhelmed to begin with, he was able to fight them and overpowered most of them, through his fighting skills and original hybrid powers. In that fight, he killed roughly twenty four non-original vampires single-handedly, showing his skills as a combatant.\n\nHis supernatural and physical attributes aside, Klaus' greatest asset is his sharp intellect. His penchant for strategies and forming contingencies way ahead of time and surpasses Elijah's penchant for strategies and forming contingencies; as he has outsmarted Elijah on several occasions and rarely is outsmarted by the latter. According to Dahlia, Klaus is the most intelligent of his maternal half-siblings.\n\n===Elijah Mikaelson===\n{{see also|Original Vampires (The Vampire Diaries)#Elijah Mikaelson}}\n* Played by [[Daniel Gillies]]\n* TVD recurring seasons: 2\u20134\n* TVD special guest starring season: 5\n* TO starring seasons: 1\u20135\n* Also played by Perry Cox (young Elijah) in seasons 1\u20132\n[[File:Daniel_Gillies_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg|thumb|100px|Daniel Gillies]]\nElijah Mikaelson is the second-oldest of the Original vampire siblings (and third-born child of Mikael and Esther).\n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nElijah first appears in episode eight of season two, entitled \"Rose\". Elijah is brought into the circle by two vampires named Rose and Trevor. They make a deal to be allowed immunity from Elijah and the Originals, if they hand over Elena Gilbert, the new Petrova doppleg\u00e4nger. It is later revealed that Rose and Trevor were the vampires who failed to keep Katerina Petrova (Katherine Pierce) alive for Klaus to sacrifice in the ritual required to release his werewolf abilities. They were subsequently hunted by Klaus and Elijah for centuries. Elijah had feelings for Katerina in 1492 (perhaps due to her resemblance to Tatia, The original Petrova, and the woman that nature-based the doppelg\u00e4nger curse off of when she was used to binding the Hybrid Curse back in the 10th Century) and tried to save her from Klaus; however, she did not trust Elijah and chose to flee. Later, he would punish her for her betrayal by compelling her to stay in a tomb until he said otherwise. Elena is rescued by the Salvatore brothers not long after Elijah kills Trevor, who had betrayed Elijah in the past by helping Katerina escape. The Salvatores attack Elijah and succeed in staking him; however, he comes back to life at the end of the episode because he is an Original vampire who can not be killed by any wooden stake. Elijah then works with a witch to locate Elena. The witch is able to locate her, so he goes to Mystic Falls to confront her, where he ends up saving her from a group of vampires who also wanted to take Elena. It is revealed that those vampires wanted to hand her over to Klaus. When Elijah discovers this, he makes peace with Elena and her friends, because he wants to use Elena as bait to draw out Klaus and kill him. He thus makes a deal with Elena that if she helps him kill Klaus, he will leave her friends alone. However, he also intends for Elena to be sacrificed as once Klaus breaks the curse and starts transforming, he will be left vulnerable enough to be killed. During a series of events, Elijah is temporarily \"killed\" when Elena stabs him with the dagger that can kill an original. When Klaus comes to town, Elena un-daggers Elijah because she needs his help, and he then reveals to her his family's history and the fact that Klaus killed the rest of his siblings. Elijah thus at first tries to help Elena and her friends kill Klaus, but ends up saving him instead in the season two finale episode, because Klaus promises to take Elijah to their family (which Elijah had assumed Klaus had hidden their \"dead\" bodies deep in the ocean) if Elijah spares him. In season three, however, it is revealed that Klaus double-crossed Elijah once again, and daggered him to keep him close to him, like the rest of his daggered siblings. Damon undaggers Elijah later to help him find a way to kill Klaus. When Elijah awakens, he undaggers the rest of his siblings who were located in coffins like his in the same room. They begin to plot their revenge against Klaus, however, before they can make their move, their thought to be dead mother Esther reappears and convinces the siblings to be a family again, which later turns out to be a front for her true motives. After Elijah foils his mother's plans to kill him and his siblings, he leaves Mystic Falls a tortured soul, ashamed of his own barbaric actions and those of his family's. He is shown to be one of the most sophisticated and peaceful of the Original siblings, alongside Finn. He is the most compromising regarding Elena and her friends. Elijah and Elena develop a sort of understanding during the series, and Elena comes to be fond of Elijah's company. She thus feels especially betrayed when earlier Elijah threatened to allow Rebekah to kill Elena if the Salvatore brothers are not able to stop Esther Mikaelson from killing the Original Family. However, in the 18th episode of season three, Elena professes that she hopes that her vampire friends are descended from Elijah's bloodline, so that he can be spared. Elijah returns to town in the season three finale episode, \"The Departed\", in order to make a deal with Elena and her friends. Elijah proposes that he be allowed to take Klaus's desiccated (by witch Bonnie and help from the Salvatores and Tyler) body with him and his siblings and leave town, and in exchange, he would make sure that Klaus would not be resurrected within Elena's lifetime or even that of her children, stating: \"perhaps that will teach him some manners.\" However, Klaus is staked, and Elijah and Rebekah believe him to be dead, even though Klaus actually possessed Tyler Lockwood's body and lives on.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nElijah follows his brother, Klaus, to New Orleans and is determined to keep his vow that they are family for forever and always, a sentiment Klaus occasionally resents, but has come to rely on.\n\nElijah meets Hayley, a werewolf carrying Klaus's unborn child, and feels an instant elation of hope that this child will be the salvation of Klaus and a means to draw their broken family back together again, and gives his word that Hayley and the child are family and under his protection. Elijah seeks to reestablish the family's home in New Orleans, as this was the time of their greatest happiness and concord.\n\nUnfortunately, Elijah is also immediately drawn to Hayley herself. Hayley returns his interest, but Elijah tries to subdue his attraction out of respect for Klaus.\n\nElijah spends most of his efforts attempting to control Klaus and keep all of his bickering family members in line. Klaus and Elijah have something of a symbiotic relationship: Elijah offers the unconditional love Klaus craves, while Klaus represents the possibility that, if Klaus can be saved, so can Elijah, while offering a fertile ground for Elijah's caretaker tendencies.\n\nElijah is often criticized for always siding with Klaus, and frequently suffers consequences for doing so. Despite his oath to stand fast with Klaus, Elijah often assumes the worst of his brother, and is quick to cause Klaus to suffer, especially physically, if it means sparing others (usually their sister, Rebekah, or Hayley).\n\nWhile he is considered the \"honorable\" one, who always keeps his word and behaves with impeccable decorum in the formal suits he only wears, Elijah is just as brutal as his brother. He also tends to be domineering, controlling, and smothering to those he considers under his care, and sometimes becomes frustrated and annoyed with Klaus keeping Elijah from what Elijah wants. Elijah must learn to loosen his rigid control, trust his family more, and be selfish every once in a while in order to find a healthier happiness.\n\nElijah eventually finds himself as the de facto king of the city, since Klaus does not like to trouble himself with the minutia of everyday rule, and must attempt to broker peace between all of the warring factions or, pending failure, destroy them all in order to make the city safe for his family and new niece.\n\nIn season four, Elijah is killed by an ancient evil known as the Hollow as part of its resurrection plan, ending his bloodline. Elijah's family manages to resurrect him, but those descended from Elijah remain dead.\n\nIn the series finale, Klaus reveals that, after taking in the Hollow, he intends to commit suicide using a white oak stake he has kept in secret for decades to end the Hollow's threat and ensure the safety of his loved ones. Elijah convinces his brother to say a proper goodbye and then reveals that he intends to die with Klaus whom he feels has been fully redeemed so that they can go on to whatever comes next together. Klaus and Elijah stake each other and die together, taking with them the Hollow.\n\n===Rebekah Mikaelson===\n{{see also|Original Vampires (The Vampire Diaries)#Rebekah Mikaelson}}\n* Played by [[Claire Holt]]\n* TVD recurring seasons: 3\u20135\n* TO starring season: 1\n* TO special guest starring seasons: 2\u20135\n* Also played by Callie McClincy (young Rebekah) in seasons 1\u20132\n[[File:Claire_Holt_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg|thumb|100px|Claire Holt]]\nRebekah Mikaelson is Klaus and Elijah's younger sister and also an original vampire. Rebekah shares a deep bond with her brother Klaus, and was the only family member that remained loyal to him despite his vicious behaviour. Klaus thus kept her by his side, while he kept the rest of his family staked and stored away in boxes for hundreds of years.\n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nRebekah had a romantic interest in Stefan Salvatore during their encounters in the early 1920s. However, when Klaus and Rebekah were once again forced to go on the run after the arrival of their vengeful father Mikael, Rebekah professed an interest to stop going on the run and live a stable life with Stefan by her side. Klaus subsequently forced her to choose between him and Stefan, and she chooses the latter. Klaus then daggers Rebekah.\n\nHe brings her back to life during the period in which the show takes place, in order to obtain her necklace (which was originally Esther's). The same necklace had been given to Elena by Stefan in season one. Rebekah and Klaus thus head to Mystic Falls. Rebekah develops a deep hatred and envy of Elena, and continually tries to hurt, kill, and emotionally distress her, until her brother makes her stop. Later on, Rebekah is once again daggered by Elena, to simplify the Salvatores' plans of killing Klaus. Elena makes a deal with Klaus for her to reveal Rebekah's location, while Klaus promises not to harm Jeremy. He takes her body with him. She is eventually un-daggered by Elijah. During her time in Mystic Falls, Rebekah enrols at the local high school, much to the disgust of Elena and her friends. There, she at first makes romantic advances towards Tyler Lockwood, Caroline Forbes's boyfriend. She later develops a fondness for Matt Donovan, and invites him to her family's ball. Rebekah is shown to be lonely and insecure, though she hides this by being cruel and violent. This is demonstrated quite well through her sexual rendezvouses with Damon Salvatore, an enemy of her family, and the subsequent torture she makes him endure upon being betrayed by him. Rebekah's body is temporarily taken over by her witch mother, Esther, through a spell performed by Esther. She invades Rebekah's body in order to be able to go unnoticed while scheming to kill all of her Original children. Esther later leaves Rebekah's body and stakes her. However, Klaus restores Rebekah to full vitality by removing the stake. In the season three finale, while Matt is driving Elena back to Mystic Falls, after trying to escape with her, Rebekah is seen standing in the middle of Wickery Bridge. Matt sees her, loses control, and drives the car into the lake, which ultimately results in Elena's death and subsequent transformation into a vampire.\n\nIn the season four premiere, Rebekah is captured alongside every other vampire in Mystic Falls. While en route to their detainment, Caroline is rescued by Klaus, inhabiting Tyler's body, but leaves his sister there. While locked up, Rebekah realises that Elena is in transition but hasn't fed on human blood, which she is delighted about because \"I get to watch you die all over again.\" However, as she sits in her cell, she listens to Elena and Stefan's heartfelt confessions of regret and love to each other with a conflicted look on her face. Rebekah then helps Stefan kill one of their guards, allowing Elena to feed on his blood and complete the transition into a vampire. After being released, Rebekah storms home and confronts Klaus, now back in his original body. Rebekah, in tears and furious, tells him how she always loved him despite everything he has done but he doesn't love or care for her as a sister. Rebekah then destroys the last few bags of Elena's blood, preventing him from creating more hybrids. In retaliation, Klaus disowns Rebekah, telling her he does not love her and she is not his sister anymore and breaks her neck. Rebekah leaves Klaus' mansion and moves into her own house. She befriends April Young, an orphan who moves back to Mystic Falls after her father is killed in an explosion. She is then asked by Stefan to tell him and Klaus the story of the Five and the cure for vampirism. After Klaus and Stefan find out what they need from her, Klaus daggers Rebekah and has Stefan hide her.\n\nLater, April learns from Caroline where Rebekah is and un-daggers her. With April's help, Rebekah takes Elena, Stefan and Caroline prisoner so that she can learn what progress they have made in finding the cure. After toying with them and finding out what she wants, she releases them. Stefan later approaches her where she states she still wishes to find the cure so she can use it on Klaus. Stefan then proposes the two work together to get the cure since they are the only two without an edge since Klaus has the sword, Damon is with Jeremy, and Bonnie is working with Professor Shane. In the episode \"A View to Kill\" Rebekah and Stefan work together to find the headstone of the first immortal creature. She then convinces him to stop caring about Elena and the two have sex.\n\nThroughout season four, Rebekah is shown to be interested in Matt Donovan but he is not interested in her. Near the end of the season, the four spend more time together and appear to be friends. Whilst Rebekah is on a test to see if she could be human Matt tells her that she would not be a good human because she is not a good person. Later on, Rebekah saves April's life, changing Matt's view of her. In the season four finale, Rebekah and Matt kiss while Matt is being held hostage and Rebekah saves his life, taking his place and allowing him to leave in order to attend graduation. Matt then develops some feelings for Rebekah and agrees to spend the summer travelling the world with her, saying that whatever happens on the road stays on the road. About three months after she returns from touring the world with Matt she returns to Mystic Falls in order to help Matt when he is buried alive by Nadia.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nDuring the first season of ''The Originals'', Rebekah returns to New Orleans in order to find and assist her brother, Elijah, who had come after their troubled brother, Klaus.\n\nRebekah is reluctantly roped into staying and playing happy families by Elijah, who wants the siblings to repair their relationships and welcome their newest member: Klaus's child. Rebekah eventually grows fond of Hayley, the child's mother, but Rebekah's increasingly contentious and sniping relationship with Klaus begins to crescendo.\n\nRebekah's main source of contention with her brother Klaus is his overbearing and controlling tendencies getting in the way of Rebekah's fondest desires: namely to start a family of her own with someone who loves her absolutely and be 'free'. Unfortunately, Klaus has a very low opinion of Rebekah's taste in men and has consistently killed every man Rebekah has ever fallen in love with, and daggered Rebekah into a forced sleep for decades as punishment for trying to leave Klaus. Rebekah has, therefore, come to fear, hate, and resent Klaus, even as she tries to honor Elijah's wish that they become a complete family once again.\n\nKlaus's opinion of Rebekah's ability to choose a partner worthy of her turns out to be generally accurate, and she is drawn to Marcel, Klaus's ward. As a test, Klaus daggers Rebekah into sleep and offers Marcel a deal. Marcel does not choose Rebekah, and she is left asleep for half a century. Despite this, the two rekindle their relationship in secret several times, with Rebekah harboring the hope that the two of them will flee her brothers' control and live happily elsewhere, since she has little hope of Klaus giving his approval.\n\nRebekah is therefore very conflicted to find that Marcel, whom she believed to be dead for nearly a century, has been alive and thriving as King of New Orleans, and has new women in his life whom he loves. Rebekah is hurt Marcel never bothered trying to find her and chose power over her love.\n\nTrapped in the cycle of an on-again-off-again relationship with Marcel, Rebekah grows increasingly bitter about the control the men in her life (Marcel and her two brothers) have over her. She attempts to gain some freedom and revenge by fomenting plots of her own with a skill that rivals her brothers', but tends to fail when her desire to be loved undermines her desire to escape her family, and the men in her life show their willingness to go to worse depths than she.\n\nUltimately, Rebekah falls from her place as the perfect and innocent sister when her past betrayal of Klaus at the prompting of her resentment and Marcel's encouragement is revealed. When Klaus proves her fears and expectations wrong; Marcel chooses something else over her yet again; Elijah lets her go; and Rebekah is accepted as a flawed individual, Rebekah realizes she can leave and be as free as she likes, which she does with happiness.\n\nAt the end of season one, Rebekah returns to New Orleans. Klaus, with no other options, gives Rebekah his new daughter, baby Hope. He tells her the only person he trusts to keep her safe is her. She leaves town with baby Hope.\n\nRebekah appears in the opening scene of season two, where we see here telling Hope a story while taking care of her.\n\nLater in season two, Rebekah is back with Hope, afraid her mother has found them. She talks to Elijah and notices something is wrong him and proceeds to find out he killed a diner full of people for no good reason (as a result of their mother forcing memories and nightmares upon him in an attempt to get him to agree to becoming mortal) so she snaps his neck in order to protect Hope from him, she then takes both Hope and Elijah to a new location where she reunites with Hayley and Klaus and the five of them take part in their Bonfire tradition. To protect Hope, she volunteers to lure their mother by faking to accept her deal. She comes to see Esther, talks to her and shares wine as they agree on the spell. As the ceremony begins, she notices the white oak stake that shouldn't be there and wants to call the spell off as their mother lied to them. She still suffers the spell and doesn't wake up in her body, but before the spell she managed to drop some of her blood into her mother's wine glass making her mother a vampire when Klaus killed her. She is now trapped in a witch's body, locked in a mansion because of Kol's revenge on her (when she betrayed him back in 1914).\n\nIn the series finale, Rebekah becomes engaged to Marcel and plans to take the cure so she can become human and die naturally, living the life she always wanted.\n\n===Hayley Marshall===\n* Played by [[Phoebe Tonkin]]\n* TVD recurring season: 4\n* TO starring seasons: 1\u20135\n[[File:Phoebe_Tonkin_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg|thumb|100px|Phoebe Tonkin]]\nHayley Marshall (born Andr\u00e9a Labonair) is a cresent werewolf. \n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nHayley sets off to find Tyler when she hears from one of Klaus's hybrids, who was from a pack she used to run with, talking about protecting him. She surprises Tyler when she shows up to his house unannounced, something Tyler is clearly happy about. While they talk, Hayley mentions helping Tyler break his sire bond. She chastises him for lying about his real identity; apparently, he had told her he lived in a trailer park in Florida. Hayley seems annoyed by this but quickly forgives him. When Caroline shows up and Tyler leaves the room to talk to her, Hayley meets Klaus who appears to talk to her. Klaus overhears Tyler and Caroline's conversation and Tyler makes an excuse about staying home, not mentioning Hayley. Klaus assumes that Tyler and Hayley had a fling, which Hayley does not deny. When Tyler comes back, he finds Hayley has gone and Klaus tells him she left. Klaus then speculates that Tyler and Hayley may have hooked up, although that hasn't been confirmed. Tyler only let Klaus believe something happened between them to distract him from Tyler's plan to break the sire bonds of the other hybrids. Hayley eavesdrops on a conversation between Tyler and Dean when Caroline shows up and meets Hayley. Hayley tells Caroline she's been staying with Tyler since she needs a place to stay, and that they're good friends. Caroline is clearly irritated that a strange girl is staying at her boyfriend's house when she knew nothing about it, but Hayley doesn't seem bothered by Caroline's irritation. Hayley excuses herself to join Tyler and Dean's argument about whether Dean should obey Klaus's order to deal with Connor or not. After Dean's death, Tyler comforts Hayley, which again irritates Caroline. Tyler later explains that he and Hayley plan to help all of Klaus's hybrids break the sire bond. Tyler finds Hayley, Chris and some other hybrids drinking in honour of Dean. Hayley keeps up the ruse that there is something romantic going on between her and Tyler by sensually wiping alcohol from Tyler's lip, knowing Klaus is witnessing it. Soon after, Caroline arrives and stages a breakup with Tyler in front of Klaus, after which he leaves with the hybrids. Once Klaus is gone, Hayley, Tyler and Caroline smile at one another, and Caroline thanks Hayley for telling her that Klaus was there. Hayley watches Tyler and Caroline kiss, smiling slightly.\n\nLater, Tyler tells Stefan about Hayley and that she helped him and Chris break their sire bonds, also revealing that they plan on unsiring all the hybrids from Klaus. That night, when Chris is about to leave Tyler's house, Klaus appears and berates Chris for failing to keep Elena secured. Tyler tries to cover for him, but Hayley intervenes to claim that she let Elena out and stands up to Klaus, daring him to kill her instead. Klaus apparently lets Chris go, but when Jeremy and Stefan arrive Klaus allows Jeremy to chop off Chris's head while Hayley and Tyler watch in horror. After Chris's death, Hayley is passed out the next morning next to Tyler on a sofa; they had clearly spent the entire night drinking in honour of Chris. After Caroline and Tyler argue she is abruptly awakened when Tyler throws a glass bottle and it explodes against the wall. Hayley is in an abandoned barn helping Kimberley break her sire bond when Tyler arrives, saying Caroline got them another day by agreeing to go with Klaus to the Miss Mystic Falls Pageant. Hayley suggests that they go to keep up the ruse that she is the reason Caroline and Tyler broke up, and Tyler reluctantly agrees. Caroline and Klaus see Hayley and Tyler arrive, which seems to upset Caroline. Hayley mocks the pageant by donning the tiara intended for the winner. Later, Damon and Tyler see Hayley talking to Shane and Damon wonders aloud how he knows her. Tyler assures him she doesn't, but Damon's suspicion seems to plant doubt in Tyler's mind. Later, when Tyler is sitting with Hayley, she asks if he got the wolf gene from his mother, claiming his mother knows how to party as she is seen drinking a lot and doesn't appear too drunk. He tells her he got the gene from his dad and asks her about her parents. She tells him she never knew her real parents and that she triggered the gene by accidentally killing someone in a boating accident while she was drunk. Tyler subtly asks if she knows Shane, but she claims she doesn't.\n\nLater that night, after Tyler calls Hayley to tell her that Kimberley broke the sire bond, Hayley is in Shane's office and tells him they freed another one. She emphasises that she doesn't want Tyler to have anything to do with whatever they are planning. When Hayley is helping Adrian break the sire bond, Kimberley interferes and frees him before they finish. Later, she breaks into Shane's office, and when he arrives she reveals that her deal with Shane was to get him twelve hybrids, unsired from Klaus, in exchange for information about her parents. Shane threatens to include Tyler in the twelve if she doesn't manage to break Adrian's sire bond so Hayley encourages Tyler to take the role of alpha and give Adrian orders to go through with it. He follows her advice, but Kimberley retaliates by kidnapping and torturing Caroline. Later, after Tyler has forced the hybrids to submit to him and Adrian has finally broken his sire bond, Hayley reports to Shane that they have their twelve hybrids. In return, Shane gives her a flash drive with information about her parents, informing her that they are dead but reassuring her that she can see them again. He cryptically tells her that it's far from over and that they are just the beginning. During the Winter Wonderland charity event, Tyler tells Caroline that Hayley has found a powerful witch who can use a spell to transport Klaus into someone else's body. When he reveals that he has volunteered to house Klaus's essence and be buried in concrete, Caroline, after much tension with Tyler and the hybrids, eventually has the idea that they should use Rebekah's body instead. Worried about changing the plan, Hayley texts Shane about having problems, but he merely tells her to fix it. Hayley then snaps Caroline's neck and tells Klaus about Tyler's plan. While Klaus is killing Tyler's pack, Hayley explains to Tyler that she made a deal with someone who can help her find her real family and that her end of the bargain was to provide twelve unsired hybrids for the sacrifice. She warns Tyler that he should leave town to escape Klaus's wrath. She then flees herself. Hayley's whereabouts were unknown until Vaughn \u2013 a hunter \u2013 reveals to Damon and Rebekah that Katherine got her information about Silas from Hayley when they crossed paths in New Orleans.\n\nIn \"Bring It On\", Hayley is attacked by a vampire named Will who was sent by Katherine to kill her. Klaus appears and saves her, in the process biting and poisoning the vampire with his werewolf venom. Klaus then takes Hayley to his mansion, where he plays the hospitable host in order to glean information about Katherine. He politely interrogates Hayley, though she claims she does not know where Katherine is. She tells Klaus that Katherine found her in New Orleans when she was trying to find her real parents and Katherine told Hayley she could help her. Klaus claims that he is the only one who can protect Hayley from Katherine's minions, and says that he will as long as she cooperates with him. Hayley goes into the next room and looks at Klaus's paintings, expressing distaste for all but one, which she describes as twisted. She asks Klaus why he paints and in response he describes painting as a metaphor for control. Hayley calls him out on his attempts to soften her up before mentioning Klaus's plans to kill Tyler. Klaus assures her that the better punishment is sentencing Tyler to a lifetime of paranoia and fear. Hayley then reveals to Klaus that the reason he has been unable to find Katherine all these centuries has been her ability to build and maintain a network of allies willing to do anything for her. Klaus asks Hayley if she knows any of Katherine's allies, and she responds teasingly that she might know a couple and she might even tell him about them. Later, after Damon has killed Will, Klaus offers to let Hayley stay anyway. She suggests a deal: her intel in exchange for Tyler's freedom, but Klaus cannot bring himself to make any promises when it comes to Tyler. Hayley draws him back in by returning to what he said about his paintings and control and tacitly offers him control with her. He takes the bait and they have sex. Afterwards, while Hayley is dressing, Klaus notices a mark on Hayley's back that, according to him, is only found on those of a certain bloodline of werewolves originating in Louisiana.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nHayley returns in \"The Originals\" where in Mystic Falls, Katherine tells Stefan and Damon that Hayley was what they needed to rid Klaus from their lives for good. In New Orleans, Hayley is told by a witch named Jane-Anne that in the bayou the wolves were named \"Roux-Ga-Roux\". Jane-Anne shows her an area on a map saying it'll give her what she is looking for. Hayley heads towards the area while Jane-Anne and Sophie prepare to do a spell on her. While Jane-Anne does the spell, Hayley's car breaks down and when seeing other people come to her she passes out with Sophie and the other witches of the Quarter circling her. Later it is revealed by Elijah and Sophie, that she is pregnant with Klaus's child.\n\nDuring the first season of ''The Originals'', Hayley had troubles coping with her pregnancy and initially tried to abort this baby but eventually came around to it. She also has feelings for Elijah, who also has the same feelings. Her story arc mainly involves her helping some Werewolves at a Bayou after Marcel got a witch to put a curse on them that would keep them in their wolf form unless it was a full moon, but this curse later got broken after Celeste used a spell to break it. Hayley is also trying to track down the real identities of her birth parents, who are revealed to have been the alphas (royal family) of the Bayou werewolves, known as the Crescent Packs, before their deaths making little Hayley the Princess of the Crescent Packs and next-in-line to lead the pack. Hayley also meets Jackson Kenner, another alpha werewolf whom her parents had betrothed her to when she was a baby hoping them to be the future King and Queen of the Crescent Packs. Throughout the first season, Hayley develops strong friendships with Rebekah Mikaelson and even Klaus somewhat and starts developing romantic feelings for Elijah Mikaelson, which he reciprocates.\n\nShe is killed by Monique Deveraux in the finale \"From a Cradle to a Grave\" after giving birth to her daughter, Hope; she later awakens in transition to a hybrid because the blood of her hybrid daughter remained within her system. She went to the graveyard to help Klaus and Elijah find Genevieve and her baby. She later stabs and kills Genevieve as revenge for trying to kill her daughter. Afterwards, she, Klaus, and Elijah agree that the best way to protect Hope is to send her away while they \"clean up the mess that [they've] made\". Hayley uses her grief over giving her daughter to Rebekah as a ruse to convince everyone in New Orleans that her daughter was killed.\n\nIn the second season, Hayley is struggling to adapt to her new hybrid status, feeling grieved over not having her daughter, enraged at the witches who tried to kill her baby and disgusted at having to live like a vampire and drink blood. Hayley and Elijah have also grown distant, as she believes he sees her the way she sees herself, as a monster, and becomes closer to Klaus when he helps her reconnect with her werewolf side. Hayley later learns that, if she marries Jackson in a mystical werewolf ritual, the entire Crescent pack will gain her hybrid ability to transform at will, thus ending their allegiance to the witches and giving protection to Hope, which would allow her to come back home to her parents. Hayley ultimately decides to go through with the wedding, even if it means ending any chance of a romantic future with Elijah. At this point, Hayley and Jackson call on the alpha werewolves of several neighboring packs to sign away their alpha statuses to Hayley and Jackson and accept them as their new alphas. This would mean the respective werewolves of each ex-alpha's pack would become part of the Crescent pack under Hayley and Jackson's leadership and all these werewolves would be able enjoy Hayley's gifts following the marriage ritual. Hayley begins developing feelings for Jackson, creating a sort of family with him, Hope, and the pack, which is now bigger and more powerful than ever. However, when the Mikaelsons' aunt Dahlia threatens to take Hope away from them as part of a pact she made with her sister Esther (Klaus and Elijah's mother), Hayley decides to flee with Jackson and Hope, earning Klaus's enmity. He curses her to be a wolf for every night except that of the full moon for six months, as punishment for attempting to take their daughter away from him.\n\nIn season three, Hayley's curse is broken by Davina so that she can kill a witch who was angered by Davina's status as regent. After a violent fight with Klaus, Hayley was eventually reunited with Hope, and is able to stay in an apartment across the street with her and Jackson. Her constant desire to help the Mikaelsons, and Elijah in particular, causes a rift between her and Jackson, who feels that Hayley is choosing them over him. They manage to reconcile at Christmas, when Jackson accepts that the Mikaelsons are her family as much as he and Hope are. Unfortunately, Tristan de Martel and his Strix vampires attack and abduct Jackson and Hayley in the Bayou the next day, as leverage against the Mikaelsons. Tristan, in revenge for Hayley helping Elijah torture him earlier in the season, rips Jackson's heart out in front of Hayley, seconds after he had proclaimed his unending love for her. This loss deeply grieves Hayley, who spends the next few weeks in a deep depression as she copes with her husband's death. Eventually, Hayley is able to regain some semblance of her former self, proving instrumental in saving Klaus and Elijah from the Strix and the de Martel siblings (though not before Klaus's sireline was broken). Hayley additionally begins taking her grief over Jackson's death out on the members of the Strix who played a hand in his death, starting with Aya. Eventually, the killings garner the attention of the remaining Strix, and Elijah is forced to intervene, killing the rest of Hayley's potential victims in order to throw others off her trail. Hayley then confesses to him that she has always loved him, yet due to guilt over Jackson's death, she decides to leave New Orleans with Klaus and Hope, in an attempt to get over her feelings for Elijah. Eventually, she returns and helps defeat Lucien and Aurora as they attempt to kill the Mikaelsons, though her friends Camille and Davina also perish. Hayley eventually begins a relationship with Elijah towards the end of the season, which is later disrupted by Marcel's quest for revenge over Davina's death. Hayley is the only member of the family left standing, with Elijah, Kol, Freya, and Rebekah under a sleeping spell with Klaus held hostage by Marcel as the anchor. She and Hope both leave New Orleans in an attempt to grow up away from the drama and find a cure for the family, only to return five years later. \n\nIt is important to note that, due to the way in which Hayley became a hybrid, she is not linked to any of the Originals. As such, if the Originals were to be destroyed, hence wiping out all vampires, Hayley would be the only vampire left on Earth. It is unknown what would happen to any vampires she sires if she is destroyed, though given the nature of her transformation, it is possible that they would survive. It is also unknown if Hayley is linked to her daughter, Hope, in the same way that vampires were linked to the Original that founded the line.\n\nIn season 5, Hayley begins with just her and Her daughter Hope as the end on season 5 the family had to split up due to, if they were to all be in the same room as Hope, Hope would get the holos magic again and it will kill her. Klaus gets led back to New Orleans as Hayley has gone missing; later it has been confirmed that Hope is the cause for the disappearance but she did it so she could see her father. \n\nHayley\u2019s body is not where Hope had placed her and her friends and family set out to find her, although she is not found until episode 6. It was shown that she had been tortured for being a hybrid, a witch performs magic which makes Hayley no longer a hybrid but only a vampire. Hayley\u2019s death was painful, she had ripped Greta\u2019s finger off (which had the daylight ring on) and grabbed her before running into the sun and both burning to death. \n\nHayley is seen again when Hope goes unconscious later on and it is seen that Hayley is at peace with her parents, other family members and Jackson. In the series finale, Hayley can be seen watching over her daughter as Klaus sacrifices himself to destroy the Hollow for good.\n\n===Marcel Gerard===\n* Played by [[Charles Michael Davis]]\n* TVD guest starring season: 4\n* TO starring seasons: 1\u20135\n* Also played by McCarrie McCausland (young Marcel) in seasons 1\u20132\n[[File:Charles_Michael_Davis_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg|thumb|100px|Charles Michael Davis]]\nMarcellus \"Marcel\" Gerard is Klaus' former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a vampire that he turned in the early 1800s.\n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nMarcel appears in the backdoor pilot of ''The Originals''.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nMarcel was born a slave and the bastard son of a plantation owner during the 1800s. Klaus rescued Marcel as a boy, saving him from whipping and essentially raising Marcel as a welcome and loved part of the Mikaelson family. Marcel's feelings towards the Originals are complex. As a child, Marcel was grateful for their intercession, had a slight hero worship for Klaus, and swore he would grow up to marry Rebekah. As an adult, Marcel resents being made to feel like a secondary member of the family, and that their abilities will always be greater as Originals. Growing up in such an unusual environment was also traumatizing for young Marcel, who witnessed many acts of arbitrary violence.\n\nKlaus refused to turn Marcel, believing it would ruin Marcel's innocence and turn him into a monster, and further objects to a romantic relationship between Rebekah and Marcel, offering Marcel the following deal: live with Rebekah for the remainder of Marcel's mortal life with Klaus's blessing, or be turned and give Rebekah up. Marcel chose being turned over Rebekah and allowed her to remain in stasis for half a century without rescue. Still, Klaus refused to turn Marcel until Marcel forced Klaus's hand while dying.\n\nPower, revenge for the injustices of his early childhood, and an obsession with outstripping and one-upping the Mikaelson's, especially Klaus, for never feeling like a true member of the family are Marcel's primary motivating factors. Marcel has a complete ban on harming children, and will often step in if he sees them mistreated or used as he was. Marcel has perhaps an even greater capability for violence, deception, and cruelty than Klaus. But, unlike Klaus, Marcel is charismatic, likable, and diplomatic, making others more willing to listen to and like Marcel as a leader, despite his swift willingness to turn on those closest and most loyal to him if it would be to his own benefit. Marcel's charm and the Mikaelson sibling's affection for him (and therefore reluctance to kill him), are Marcel's greatest assets.\n\nAfter the Originals were forced to flee New Orleans in 1919, Marcel chooses to take over the city and declare himself as king in the power void, rather than informing his adoptive family that he is still alive. Marcel is a popular king, who keeps the vampires happy with parties, rewards systems, and the promise of earning a Daylight Ring once they reach his inner circle. Marcel successfully subdued and drove out the werewolves using a curse, placates the humans with promises of a low death count and limiting attacks to tourists, and recently came into possession of a super weapon that allows him total control of the witches, banning them from using magic. All supernatural factions must follow the set of rules and edicts issued by Marcel. Marcel takes extreme pride in his ability to run the French Quarter under exclusive vampire rule, and enjoys that he is better-liked than Klaus.\n\nConflict arises when the Originals return to the city and feel betrayed by Marcel's deception and what Klaus views as the theft of one of his proudest achievements: the city of New Orleans. All three siblings begin to work against Marcel. Klaus is envious of Marcel's success and the apparent love and loyalty of Marcel's followers, and swears to take what he considers rightfully his and punish Marcel for allowing Klaus to mourn for him. Rebekah is angry that Marcel betrayed their relationship and moved on with no regrets. And Elijah will always be most loyal to his original siblings, and seeks to support their desires and recreate the time when they were happiest: during their rule of New Orleans.\n\nThe deciding lynch pin for who will ultimately take the city is a young, 16 year old witch, named Davina. Believing Davina was intended as a human sacrifice, Marcel, who again dislikes any mistreatment of children, slaughtered the witch community and rescued a grateful Davina. Davina has immense power, enough to subdue an Original, and aids Marcel in quest of controlling the city. Marcel comes to love Davina and feels extremely protective and proprietary towards her, putting her into his care and under his protection.\n\nOnce Davina is removed from the equation, Klaus openly declares his intention to retake his city and Marcel is forced to resentfully relinquish his rule in the face of Klaus's demonstration that everything Marcel has built is worthless in the face of Klaus's abilities as the Original Hybrid . Klaus, lonely and wishing for companionship, requests Marcel remain as his co-ruler, which Marcel happily accepts while plotting with Rebekah to take power back, and rubbing it in Klaus's face that Klaus will never be loved as a king.\n\nEventually, Marcel betrays both Rebekah, who wished Marcel would finally choose her, and Klaus, revealing that Marcel was the source of betrayal that led them to flee the city in the first place. Elijah banishes Marcel from the city as a consequence and takes de facto control.\n\nMarcel becomes obsessed with taking back rulership and begins using guerrilla warfare tactics to incite a civil war among the city's supernatural factions and undermine Elijah's peace treaties. Marcel is especially opposed to Elijah's proposals since they grant power to the witches and werewolves, whom Marcel had formerly subjugated in favor of the vampires. The conflicts result in the death of Marcel's friend, Thierry, which incites Marcel to higher heights of violence. The Originals are still fond enough of Marcel to be reluctant to kill him, but their reservations for restraint become strained, eventually running out during a battle when Marcel rallies all of the vampires in New Orleans to attack the Mikaelson compound and stop the creation of Moonlight Rings, which would allow the werewolves power. Elijah proves he is more than capable of handling the entire population of vampires by himself, while Klaus easily subdues and bites Marcel. Already weakened by Elijah, all of Marcel's vampires are quickly finished off by the werewolves, and Marcel must find a way to lure Klaus back to the compound and bleed him in order to cure his friends.\n\nMarcel saves the life of Klaus's baby and uses her to bring Klaus back to the compound, only to find that he is too late. Marcel apologizes for his previous betrayal, and grateful for Marcel's interference and newly united against their common enemies, the witches and the werewolves, Klaus extends friendship and the two return to being allies. Marcel subdues his ultimate goals, to transcend Klaus and take back New Orleans, in order to gain the Original's help destroying the werewolves.\n\nMarcel once again finds himself at war with the Original clan when Davina dies for another time and Marcel is desperate to resurrect her. The plan fails due to interference and Marcel blames all of the Mikaelson's, vowing revenge. Marcel maintains that Klaus is a true monster, and not Marcel. In \"Give 'Em Hell Kid\", Marcel becomes an Enhanced Original Vampire after Elijah kills Marcel out of fear of a prophecy without knowing Marcel had taken the serum.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Give Em Hell Kid|episodelink=|series=The Originals|serieslink=The Originals (TV series)|airdate=May 13, 2016|season=3|number=21}}</ref>\n\nWith this new power, Marcel is finally stronger than the Originals and believes he would make a more benign and just ruler, having come to believe that the Mikaelson's are corrupt, egotistical monsters, unlike himself. Despite now having the ability to not only kill the Originals, but kill them all at once, Marcel Gerard \"allows\" the Mikaelson family to live in exchange for the city, and Klaus's eternal punishment of being pinned with a dagger that causes continuous pain and walled into the compound.\n\nAfter Freya saves the Mikaelson's five years later they manage to rescue Klaus and Marcel agrees to let them live in exchange for the family leaving the city. However, the threat of the Hollow forces Marcel to reluctantly ally himself with the Originals once again against the greater threat. After the defeat of the Hollow, Klaus makes amends with Marcel, apologizing for failing Marcel as a father.\n\nIn the series finale, Marcel resumes his relationship with Rebekah as Klaus prepares to sacrifice himself to destroy the Hollow once and for all. Having put aside their differences, Marcel is devastated by Klaus' coming demise and joins the family in celebrating his life, promising to be there for Hope if she ever needs him. Marcel decides to leave New Orleans for good and take the remaining vampires with him, leaving the city to the humans. Rebekah proposes to Marcel, revealing that she intends to travel to Mystic Falls and take the cure so she can finally live out a human life as she has always wanted. Despite the fact that he will one day lose her to old age, Marcel accepts her proposal and they set out together to live a new life.\n\n===Sophie Deveraux===\n* Played by [[Daniella Pineda]]\n* TVD guest starring season: 4\n* TO starring season: 1\nSophie Deveraux is a witch, antagonist, and a main character in Season 1 of ''The Originals''.\n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nSophie appears in the backdoor pilot of ''The Originals''.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nIn the past, she was a light-hearted girl who enjoyed partying and didn't care much for witchcraft. However, 8 months before the start of the series, she watched her niece, Monique Deveraux, die in The Harvest, a sacrificial ritual that allows the witches in New Orleans to draw power from their ancestors. After that, she became more serious, obsessed with the goal of killing Davina so she can complete the ritual and bring her niece back from the dead. Sophie has made it clear that she will do whatever it takes to reach her goal, which makes her dangerous to have as an enemy. She was later killed by Monique.\n\nShe was linked to Hayley for a short period of time while Hayley was pregnant. This was to allow her to bargain with the Original Vampires. This meant that all that happened to Sophie also happened to Hayley. This caused a near miscarriage for Hayley. Just before Hayley miscarried Davina unlinked Sophie and Hayley, allowing Hayley's pregnancy to continue.\n\n===Camille O'Connell===\n* Played by [[Leah Pipes]]\n* TVD guest starring season: 4\n* TO starring seasons: 1\u20133\n* TO guest starring season: 4\u20135\n[[File:Leah_Pipes_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg|thumb|100px|Leah Pipes]]\nCamille \"Cami\" O'Connell is a bartender who is fascinated by the question of whether people can be born bad.\n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nCamille appears in the backdoor pilot of ''The Originals''.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nAfter an unimaginably tragic event in her family, Camille became a psychology student in order to study human behaviour, in the hopes of proving that people can't just be \"evil\". Her fixation on the subject might just help her bond with Klaus, though Camille is unaware that her corner of New Orleans is crawling with supernatural beings who walk the line between good and evil. She is also fascinated and shares a love-hate relationship with Klaus, who has feelings for her. She also had a brief romance with Marcel, but that was only short lived. Her uncle Kieran falls under a hex, when he goes mad from the hex, Camille has Klaus turn Kieran into a vampire in hopes of curing the hex. When it doesn't work, Kieran, going crazy and in transition, tries to kill Camille. Klaus saves her and kills Kieran. After her uncles' death, she gets a key, to an apartment her uncle owned. She discovers a secret room filled with supernatural weapons and books.\n\nIn season two, Camille tries to focus on her studies and meets with her new counsellor, who is none other than Finn Mikaelson in Vincent's body. Later, she discovers the truth about him and allies with the vampires and the werewolves to help them take him down because she feels that he's got a crush on her. She's part of their plan to capture Finn and on a date with him, she lures him into an isolated alley where she gets attacked by a werewolf, which was Hayley. Later in the church, Cami is recovering with Hayley's blood and when Finn is down thanks to Jackson's arrows, she handcuffs him. On the same night, she is seen drinking in her bar when Esther comes and put a spell on her. On the next days, she doesn't recall Esther's spell and finds out when Hayley shows her. She seeks help from Davina, Kol, Marcel and Klaus only to find out from Finn that Esther has been preparing her to welcome Rebekah in her body. As Finn doesn't want to help her, she waits for Esther's spell but is successfully protected by Davina and is still controlling her body.\n\nIn season three, Cami is turned into a vampire by Aurora de Martel (Klaus's ex-girlfriends) out of jealousy; because Aurora is jealous of Klaus's affection towards Camille, Camille was later bitten by Lucien Castle, after he became an Upgraded Original Vampire, also known as the Beast, Klaus, Elijah and Freya try to find a cure for Lucien's venom, they even try to use his blood to cure Camille, only to find out that the Beast's blood cannot cure his own venom. Camille later dies peacefully in Klaus's arms, much to the latter's grief. Her death is avenged by Klaus.\n\n===Davina Claire===\n* Played by [[Danielle Campbell]]\n* TO starring seasons: 1\u20133\n* TO recurring season: 4\n* TO guest starring season: 5\n[[File:Danielle_Campbell_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg|thumb|100px|Danielle Campbell]]\nDavina Claire is a nineteen-year-old witch with a dark side (16 at the beginning of series). Born late 1994-early 1995 in New Orleans. She's still learning the full extent of her powers and has Marcel as her protector. Davina is in hiding from the witches of the Quarter as they would want to kill her to complete The Harvest. In the meantime, her powers are too much for her to handle and can result in a disaster if they were to get out of control. Finally, she was sacrificed for the sake of New Orleans. Unfortunately, when she died her powers didn't go back to the Earth since they were stolen by Celeste. Following the death of Celeste, Davina was revived. In the final episode of season one, Davina brings Mikael Mikaelson (father of Originals) back from the dead and tethers him to a bracelet that she controls.\n\nIn season two, Davina tries to find a way to unlink Marcel's and Josh's destiny to Klaus' so that Mikael can kill him. In a disc shop, she meets Kaleb and begins to bind with him, unaware he's Kol Mikaelson. She still has Mikael under her control and when on a date with Kaleb they get attacked by the werewolves searching for the white oak stake, she summons him to help them and Elijah against the wolves. Because Elijah (and so Klaus) found out about Mikael being back, Davina runs off to hide in a cabin. She asks Mikael to teach her how to defend herself and be stronger but gets hurt and calls Kaleb to help her heal. Klaus finds her and attacks them, and she gets hit on the head. When she wakes up, Mikael is gone because Kaleb has unlinked her to him. She tries to finish her spell to unlink Marcel's and Josh's life to Klaus' and as she wants to channel Kaleb powers to get stronger, she discovers the truth about him being Kol and unlinking her to Mikael. So she wants to destroy the white oak stake and unable to do it, she allies with Kol to disable it for a moment. Davina manages to get the stake back and then runs off with Kaleb, still searching how to get her revenge on Klaus. They agree on stabbing him with some dark knife Kol has kept over the years, and then putting on a coffin so that Marcel and Josh won't die. She wakes up one morning and finds out that Kol and the white oak stake are missing so she goes to Marcel and Josh to tell them. She apologizes for believing Kol was faithful to her but Marcel tells her he kidnapped Kol with the stake to get them to Klaus. Davina manages to avoid Josh's surveillance and goes to Kol's secret lair. After using a spell, she confronts Klaus with the hopes to make him angry so that he would bite her and become poisoned. Later she has to revive him when she learns that Cami is in danger and Kol is on Marcel's and Klaus' side to take Esther down. She helps Cami by successfully protecting her from Esther's spell and on the side, she continues plotting with Kol to create the dagger to take Klaus down.\n\nIn season 3, she joined the Strix's coven known as the Sisters in order to bring back her lover Kol Mikaelson. After successfully resurrecting Kol, she is killed by him when the Ancestors took control of him. However, at the end of season 4, a powerful witch called 'The Hollow' revives Davina to manipulate Kol to help her. With the help of Hope, Kol is able to successfully save Davina from 'The Hollow'. After saying goodbye to Josh, Davina and Kol decide to leave New Orleans to see the world. In the last episode of season 4, Kol has a diamond engagement ring made, intending to propose to Davina.\n\nIt is mentioned in the first episode of season 5 that Kol and Davina did indeed get married and are living together in Belize.\n\n===Vincent Griffith===\n* Played by [[Yusuf Gatewood]]\n* TO recurring seasons: 1\u20132\n* TO starring seasons: 2\u20135\nVincent Griffith is a very powerful witch, who is the former Regent of the Nine Covens and a current member of the Trem\u00e9 Coven. He was formerly married to Eva Sinclair.\n\n===Freya Mikaelson===\n{{see also|Original Vampires (The Vampire Diaries)#Freya Mikaelson}}\n* Played by [[Riley Voelkel]]\n* TO recurring season: 2\n* TO starring seasons: 3\u20135\n* LG special guest season: 2\n* Also played by Elle Graham (young Freya) in TO season 2\nFreya Mikaelson is the firstborn child of Mikael and Esther, the eldest sister of Finn, Elijah, Kol, Rebekah, and Henrik, the maternal older half-sister of Niklaus, and the paternal aunt of Klaus' daughter with Hayley Marshall, Hope. She is a main character on ''The Originals''. Freya was born in the late years of the 10th century to a Viking warrior named Mikael and his wife Esther. Her parents had met after her mother was captured during a Viking raid, and fell in love before marrying. Freya was their first born child. Her birth was a result of a deal her mother made with her aunt, Dahlia, who used magic to make the barren Esther able to have children of her own. She was, according to Esther, the apple of Mikael's eye. However, when she was five, Freya was taken by her aunt as part of Esther's deal when Esther was pregnant with Elijah and her life following that is a mystery. Esther claimed that she was the victim of a plague in order to cover up what she and Dahlia had done, which is what caused Mikael and Esther to move from Norway to a village in a \"mystical land\" far away in the New World, which was later called Mystic Falls.\n\nThey moved there under the advisement of Esther's dear friend and mentor, a witch named Ayana, who told them that the inhabitants were extremely healthy and had increased strength and speed. These villagers were later revealed to be werewolves. In the modern day, Freya was mentioned by Elijah, when he explained to Elena that his mother and father had seven children, and again by Rebekah, when she told Elena the story about how her family ended up in Mystic Falls. Rebekah explained that their parents had lost a child in Europe to the plague and that later, Esther, Mikael, and Ayana moved to Mystic Falls, where Mikael and Esther eventually had the rest of their children, excluding Finn and Elijah, who were born in the Old World. It was also said that Freya's death is what made Mikael become so cruel and abusive, as she was his favourite child.\n\nIn Wheel Inside the Wheel, it was revealed that Freya had not been killed by the plague, but was instead given to Dahlia as payment for reversing Esther's infertility and allowing her to have her children. The payment was stated that Esther was to give Dahlia Freya, the first born child of each of her children, and every subsequent first born child for as long as Esther's line will last. Dahlia used a spell to increase her power, while also binding Freya's power to Dahlia's. Freya lived under Dahlia for many years, ostensibly as a member of her coven, but in reality, Freya was more of a slave. Dahlia poisoned Freya's mind, telling her that her mother did not want her and that Dahlia was all she had. When Dahlia learned that Esther had turned her children into the first vampires, and thus ended her bloodline, the weight of carrying on Dahlia's plans fell onto Freya, who swore that she would never fall in love or have a child, in order to spare any child the fate of being Dahlia's. When Dahlia attempted to cast her pseudo-immortality spell on both of them, Freya at first resisted, only to have Dahlia force it on them. For centuries they existed, slumbering for a century while their ageing arrested and their power magnified, to then live for a single year.\n\nFreya met and fell in love with a man named Mathias, and a child was conceived between them. They attempted to escape from Dahlia, however, she easily tracked them down and placed a death hex on Freya's lover. Depressed and in pain, Freya drank from a deadly poison in an attempt to kill both herself and her unborn son, so that they could both be free from Dahlia. However, much to her horror, she discovered that part of the immortality ritual was a powerful protection spell that prevented them from being killed, however, as the spell was not cast upon Freya's child, he was truly lost, leaving Freya a sobbing mess in Dahlia's arms.\n\nIn 1914, she befriended Kol and was his \"date\" during a Christmas party at the Abattoir to get a glimpse of her family. Rebekah, recognising Freya as the witch that Kol had brought to the party to accompany him, approached her and insisted that she could do better than Kol. Freya told her that it wasn't really a date before Rebekah made to join the rest of the Mikaelsons and Marcel on the staircase for Klaus' speech. This marked the first time that the two Mikaelson sisters had met in their lives, and Rebekah remained unaware that she had met her older sister until a century later when they both escaped from the witch asylum together. During Klaus' speech, Kol and Freya toasted each other from across the room, but the cheerful and festive night quickly took a dramatic turn when Klaus publicly condemned Kol's treachery and she witnessed Kol getting daggered by Klaus. She later went into the Dowager Fauline Cottage, seeing it as the safest place to be during her century of sleep and because she knew her aunt wouldn't come there.\n\nEntering a deep sleep that lasted a century, she awoke 100 years later where she discovered that her sister, Rebekah, had been imprisoned in the Asylum in the body of a young witch. Posing as an inmate, she witnessed Rebekah's confrontations with the Kindred and Cassie's betrayal. Using her magic, Freya saved Rebekah from the Kindred and broke the spell on the Asylum, freeing herself and Rebekah.\nWhen Freya reunites with her brother Finn, he informs her of Hope's life, which inspires Freya (who wishes take revenge against Dahlia for the deaths of her lover and son) so she can kill her as Dahlia would come for her niece, so she affiliates herself with her siblings. In the end of hard long magical struggle (resulting in the death of both her parents), Freya and her younger siblings finally managed to defeat Dahlia, with Freya's finally winning her younger brothers trusts (especially Niklaus), and moving into their house as Hope's caretaker and an official Mikaelson sibling.\n\nAfter a few months of peace in the supernatural community in NOLA, troubles started again with the arrival of Lucien Castle, Klaus's first progeny, and his warnings of war between the sire-lines, and so, Freya's enormous magical powers were needed again to protect her family from harm.\n\nFreya once again showcased her great skill and power in the season three series finale. Freya, looking for a way to save her family quickly and uniquely, adapts two ancient spells to save her siblings. In order for her spell to work, she utilised Esther's linking spell, binding each sibling, including herself, to Klaus, while she replicated her aunt Dahlia's immortality slumber spell, (replicated for the first time in over 10 centuries). She also took a page from Finn's spell book and drew everyone, save Klaus, into a Chambre de chasse, so that they could be a family while slumbering, in order to escape death (while Klaus lived and suffered). That was the only way to save herself and the others until Hayley found a cure to their ailments. As of this moment, Freya is now once again immortal since she is now linked to Klaus, who became the anchor to her spell. The slumber spell acts as a protection against all forms of harm; therefore, Elijah and Kol will not die from Marcel's bite and Freya will not succumb to the fatal toxin. Rebekah is currently no longer suffering from the insanity hex since she was pulled into the Chambre de chasse.\n\nShe is later married to Keelin, a werewolf.\n\n===Josh Rosza===\n* Played by [[Steven Krueger]]\n* TO recurring seasons: 1\u20134\n* TO starring season: 5\nJoshua \"Josh\" Rosza is a vampire. He is one of Marcel's top right-hand men as well as out-and-proud homosexual. As a human, he was best friends with a girl named Tina. Josh went to New Orleans with Tina and was invited to a party that was hosted by Marcel. Josh and Tina were subsequently attacked by vampires and were severely injured. Klaus discovered vampire blood in their systems and ultimately snapped their necks. The next day, Marcel flipped a coin; the winner would remain as a vampire and the other would be killed. Tina ended up grabbing the coin, but the exercise was revealed to be a test of loyalty; she failed. Tina was killed, and Josh was allowed to live on as a vampire.\n\nIt was later revealed that right after Josh turned up in New Orleans and had vampire blood in his system, Klaus Mikaelson broke his and his friend's neck to create spies for himself against Marcel and his empire. Once Josh completed his transition into a vampire, Klaus compelled him to be his spy, his eyes and ears. Josh seemed to be an effective spy for him by helping him drain a vampire off vervain and framing Marcel's best friend Thierry. But after his compulsion was removed by Davina, he betrayed Klaus and sent him to an ambush. After that, he has laid low and stayed hidden from Klaus.\n\nJosh met Davina after Marcel discovers Klaus' compulsion upon him, he requests Davina to free him in order to work as his spy. Josh is initially fearful of her although warms up to her after they bond over music, whilst Davina works her painful spell. After Josh's compulsion is lifted, they laugh over their differing views of \"normal\" and they are both noticeably sad when Marcel wants Josh to forget her. They \"pinky promise\" that Josh would keep her secret in exchange to keep his memories, as he says it's nice to talk to somebody again. Whilst Josh is stuck in the shadows without a daylight ring, he is expressively fearful of Klaus and Davina promises to protect him.\n\nIn season two, Josh meets Aiden in the episode 'Live and Let Die', when Josh is living at Marcel's loft with the rest of the new vampires, checking his cell phone. Marcel asks him about any prospects and Josh informs him that there is this one guy he's been messaging with and that he really likes him. When Marcel asks what the problem is, Josh then expresses doubt about having any kind of normal relationship on account of his need of blood to survive. Before the conversation can go any further, someone is thrown through the window. The loft is suddenly swarmed by werewolves wearing Moonlight Rings. Aiden is revealed to be a werewolf and the leader of this attack group of wolves. Aiden tells Marcel that the deal of the vampires staying out of the Quarter is over and that the vampires must leave New Orleans entirely. To prove his point, Aiden has one of the other werewolves bite a vampire. When another goes for Josh, Aiden calls them off and warns Marcel that they need to be gone when they come back, because he won't call them off next time.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Josh is at Bywater Tavern, glancing at his phone and looking a little nervous, when Aiden comes in and it's revealed that he is the guy Josh has been messaging on the dating app. After a brief conversation, the two decide to pretend they're not at war for the night and just be themselves.\n\nIn the episode ''Chasing the Devil's Tail'', Josh is at Marcel's loft with Aiden, Hayley and Marcel as they all outline a plan to take out Vincent. Cami soon shows up with a box full of dark objects that are able to take down a witch. Josh makes a joke of it, \"Sweet it's a big box of dusty old junk. We're saved\", which Aiden laughs at. At this point, Josh and Aiden begin seeing each other romantically and in secret, worried about their respective groups finding out about their vampire-werewolf, same-sex romance that might threaten both of their lives.\n\nIn the episode ''Gonna Set Your Flag on Fire'' when the rest of the vampires and werewolves are trapped at Marcel's compound by a witch's spell, Josh and Aiden fully acknowledge their love for each other. A short while later, Josh confides in Marcel about his romance with Aiden who reacts supportive to it. At the same time, Jackson tells Aiden about him being aware of Aiden's involvement with Josh, a vampire, and cautions him about proceeding with it.\n\nIn the episode ''I Love You, Goodbye'' Josh finally decides to go public with his romance with Aiden when they both attend Hayley and Jackson's wedding at Marcel's compound when he and Aiden sit side by side. In episode 'City Beneath the Sea', Aiden is brutally murdered by Dahlia who sets it up to make it look like Klaus murdered him by tearing out his heart in an attempt to further divide the werewolves and vampires against each other. Josh and Davina find his body later, which devastates him. In the next episode, Josh attends Aiden's funeral in the bayou alongside the other werewolves despite the tensions still lingering between the two supernatural groups.\n\nIn Season 4, it is revealed that he is dating a human named Eddie (played by [[Keahu Kahuanui]]).\n\nIn the missing years between seasons 4 and 5, Josh remains in New Orleans, trying to maintain the peace between the vampires, wolves and the witches, along with the help of Freya and Vincent. When a group of purist vampires start killing halfbreeds, including Hayley Marshall, Marcel returns to the city, and Josh and Vincent work with him to keep the city safe. When Marcel is lured into a trap by the purists who want to extract the venom from his fangs, Josh successfully rescues him, but is injected with Marcel's venom during a fight. He dies moments later in Marcel's arms. He is later seen reunited with Aiden in the afterlife, after having spent 15 years apart.\n\n===Hope Mikaelson===\n{{see also|Original Vampires (The Vampire Diaries)#Hope Mikaelson}}\n* Played by uncredited infant actors (seasons 1\u20133), Summer Fontana (season 4), and [[Danielle Rose Russell]] (season 5, ''Legacies'' season 1)\n* TO guest season: 1\n* TO recurring seasons: 2\u20134\n* TO starring season: 5\n* LG starring season: 1\u2013present\nHope Andrea Mikaelson, sometimes referred to as Hope Marshall, is Klaus Mikaelson and Hayley Marshall's extremely powerful daughter who, apart from being a vampire-werewolf hybrid, is also a witch of the Mikaelson bloodline, one of the most powerful witch lineages in the fictional universe of the series. Moreover, her vampire side is that of an Original vampire, making her almost invincible and more powerful than average vampires and her werewolf side is that of an alpha werewolf, through Hayley, making her royalty among the werewolves, the Princess of the Crescent pack.\n\nOriginally at her school, the Salvatore Boarding School, she is referred to as Hope Marshall to keep her identity as Klaus' daughter secret to reduce her chances of becoming the target of one or more of his many enemies. However, by the time ''Legacies'' premiered this was retconned and everyone at the school knows her real name and her lineage. An integral part of the launch of ''Legacies'', Hope finally showed that she is more than her darkened lineage, until that is she threw herself into Malivore to save Landon and the world, erasing herself from existence.\n\n==Recurring characters==\nThe following is a list of characters that are, or at one time were, a recurring guest on the series.

episode, \"Heart of Darkness\", Kol appears in Denver, Colorado, where Elena and Damon had sent Jeremy, to get him away from Mystic Falls and protect his life. He threatens to hurt Jeremy, in order to prevent Elena and Damon from trying to find out the history of Damon's blood line, (if they managed to do so, they might find out that Elena's friends are not descended from Kol, which would allow them to kill him). Damon drives a baseball bat through Kol's body in order to debilitate him so that he, Elena, and Jeremy can escape. Kol later appears at the house of Mary Porter, the vampire who sired Rose. Kol kills Mary, so that she is not able to tell Elena and Damon about the history of her bloodline, which could lead them to find out which Original vampire Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Tyler, and Abby Bennett are descended from, (Mary sired Rose, Katherine Pierce forced Rose to sire her, and Katherine later sired Damon and Stefan; Damon sired Caroline, Abby, and Elena).\n\nIn season four, Kol returns to aid Rebekah in finding the rumored \"cure\" for vampirism. He tortures Professor Shane, who supposedly knows how to get the cure. When Kol realizes that Shane plans to release Silas, the first and most dangerous immortal being of all time, Kol stabs Shane through the torso with a wooden object, killing him. However, Bonnie is able to save Shane's life through an \"expression\", or dark magic spell.\nKol compels Damon to kill Jeremy so that they cannot find Silas, but Stefan locks Damon away so that he cannot.\n\nElena and Jeremy decide to try and kill Kol because he is trying to stop them from getting the cure. Since Jeremy needs to kill vampires to complete the map to the cure, they conclude that if they kill Kol, which also kills his whole line of vampires, the map will be complete.\nElena lures Kol into the house and waits for Jeremy to bring Bonnie, but he does not make it in time. Elena and Jeremy are talking later when Kol appears, storms into the house and tries to cut off Jeremy's hunting arm. Elena rescues Jeremy and corners Kol in the kitchen. During the altercation, Jeremy showers Kol in water mixed with vervain. While Kol is stunned, Jeremy stabs him with the white oak stake and he dies. Meanwhile, Klaus is watching in the doorway, furious, unable to help his brother because he has not been invited in. He vows to avenge his brother's death, swearing to kill Jeremy, Elena and anyone else involved.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nIn season one, Kol's corpse appears, stabbed, on the ship that brought the Mikaelsons to New Orleans.\n\nIn season two, Kol returns in the body of a young Witch named [[#Kaleb Westphall|Kaleb Westphall]], along with his brother Finn and their mother who returned at the end of season one. Kol wants revenge on his brothers Klaus and Elijah and helps his mother with her plans. He starts by getting close to the witch Davina, earning her trust and showing her his powers. But he becomes attached to her and hides information from his mother (the return of Mikael). Klaus discovers Kaleb's true identity in Red Door. Kol/Kaleb spends most of his time with Davina to get the white oak stake for his mother. Kol tells Davina about his past, about all the magical objects he's collected over the years and the plan he's been thinking of; to dagger Klaus and to lock him in a coffin.\n\nWhen Davina falls asleep, he is captured along with the white oak stake by Marcel and brought back to Klaus and Elijah. Marcel and Klaus, convince him to participate in the plan to take Esther down. But Kol has still something on his mind since 1914 when he tried to steal a \"Fauline diamond\" to create the dagger. During that era, Kol was involved with a witch named Mary-Alice Claire and taught her magic, most notably being the technique known as Kemiya. When he stole the diamond, he asked Rebekah to be part of his plan but after she agreed, he found out she betrayed him by telling Klaus. Klaus daggered him with the help of Elijah. Klaus also trapped his girlfriend and her friend in a mansion.\n\nIn present day, as their mother performs her spell, Kol gets his revenge by transferring Rebekah into a witch's body trapped in the mansion. He now has everything he needs: he got the diamond back as part of the deal to ally against Esther, Klaus will be occupied looking for Rebekah and Davina will be helping him for the dagger. \nDavina convinces Kol to help her rescue a captured Josh. Unfortunately, that leads to Kol being cursed by Finn during the rescue mission. Finn curses Kol to die in a few days. During his last days, Kol reconciles with his family and helps Davina finish the dagger so that she can protect herself. He dies surrounded by his family members and the girl he loved.\nDavina resurrects Kol after using help from the Strix. She then discovers he is possessed by the Ancestors. They eventually take full control over him and cause him to kill Davina.\n\nBy the end of the series, Davina is back, and she and Kol become engaged.\n\n===Sabine Laurent===\n* Played by [[Shannon Kane]]\n* Season: 1\n[[File:Shannon Kane 66\u00e8me Festival de Venise.jpg|thumb|100px|Shannon Kane]]\nSabine Laurent is a witch who is possessed by Celeste DuBois. Celeste and Elijah were in love in the 1800s until 1820 when Klaus sent rumor that the bodies were a result of the witches seeking blood sacrifice for their rituals. She has been holding a grudge and plotting her revenge for 2 centuries. She was the reason why the harvest girls didn't resurrect when they were supposed to. Sabine had the ability to jump into different bodies whenever she died and that's why she has been alive all this time.\n\n===Diego===\n* Played by [[Eka Darville]]\n* TVD guest starring season: 4\n* TO recurring season: 1\n[[File:Eka Darville at the premiere of Mr Pip, Toronto Film Festival 2012.jpg|thumb|100px|Eka Darville]]\nDiego was once a human, who was then turned into a vampire, likely sired by Marcel Gerard. He is one of Marcel's guards, and is a member of Marcel's inner circle, who gain daylight rings upon entry. He's loyal to Marcel and his friends; one of his close friends is Thierry Vanchure. Just like Thierry, Diego does not like, nor trust the Originals.\n\nIn ''The Originals'', Diego seemed to be one of Marcel's closer advocates as Marcel came to his rescue when Klaus had lashed out. He stated that he only answers to Marcel, and his loyalty to Marcel is so strong that he dared to talk back to Klaus of all people, when he came to him seeking Marcel's whereabouts. Diego was choked by Klaus as a result of such disrespect toward him. Marcel stepped in to break up the fight, but Diego responded in a tone that shows his full loyalty to Klaus' former protege.\n\nAt the end of season one, Diego and the other Vampires are attacked by a group of werewolves using mystic stones to access they full power and while fleeing, he is ambushed and bitten. While Diego and the others lay dying in the courtyard, Mikael comes and drains the vampires of all their blood, allowing the werewolf venom to finish them off quicker.\n\n===Thierry Vanchure===\n* Played by Callard Harris\n* TVD guest starring season: 4\n* TO recurring season: 1\nThierry Vanchure was once a human living in the 1940s.

When Marcel told Klaus that he was now king of New Orleans and that Klaus was nothing anymore, Klaus responded by biting Thierry and infecting him with a hybrid bite, as a show of power. Later, in line with Sophie's plan to overthrow Marcel, Klaus healed Thierry to try to gain Marcel's trust. He is later killed by Elijah via his heart being ripped out as a warning to Marcel.\n\n===Mikael===\n{{see also|Original Vampires (The Vampire Diaries)#Mikael}}\n* Played by [[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]]\n* TVD recurring season: 3\n* TO recurring seasons: 1\u20132\n* TO guest starring season: 4\n* Also played by Isaiah Stratton (young Mikael) in season 2\n[[File:Sebastian Roch\u00e9.jpg|thumb|100px|Sebastian Roch\u00e9]]\nMikael is the vampire who hunts vampires in season three of ''The Vampire Diaries''.

Mikael finally gets the chance to kill Klaus with the help of Damon but Stefan interferes and saves Klaus, allowing the latter to kill Mikael with his own weapon, a white-oak stake.

He saves her, Elijah and Kaleb/Kol from the werewolves and almost kills Elijah when Davina's bracelet gets off her wrist. But she gets it back in time and ties it with a spell. When they hide in the cabin, Mikael begins to teach how to be stronger the way he taught his sons and hurts her. When Klaus finds them, he forces Kol to unleash him from Davina and fight with Klaus only to get stabbed with Papa Tunde's knife. He manages to get it out from him and takes Cami hostage to lure Klaus. Even if he promised not to do so, he feeds on Cami to get his strength back after being stabbed. They meet each other with Klaus in a warehouse and Mikael finally manages to stab him with the white oak stake. Seeing Klaus doesn't burn, he understands Davina is putting a spell on it and he goes after her and stops the spell only after Cami gets the stake out of Klaus' chest.

It was later found out that his mother was adulterous, and Klaus' biological father was a werewolf, which makes Klaus the only original vampire-werewolf hybrid in existence. However, his werewolf powers were bound to the moonstone by a band of witches, which includes his mother. To release his werewolf powers a ritual, in which a werewolf, a vampire and a Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger have to be sacrificed, has to take place. The first Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger Klaus found was Katerina Petrova, but she escaped Klaus with the moonstone and hung herself in order to become a vampire so that she would be useless for the ritual. Klaus then wanted revenge on Katerina, causing her to spend centuries running from him.\n\nHundreds of years later, Klaus finds Katerina and Elena Gilbert, the next Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger, through Isobel Flemming. He kidnaps Katerina and makes her torture herself. After collecting the moonstone, a werewolf, Jules, the Petrova doppleg\u00e4nger, Elena, and turning Jenna Sommers into a vampire, he begins the ritual and his werewolf side is released. He later blackmails Stefan into helping him create more non-original werewolf-vampire hybrids, which he wants to create because he feels lonely, and turns him into a killer again. It is later revealed that he brought Stefan with him because they were once friends. After he finds out that he needs Elena's blood to create more non-original werewolf-vampire hybrids, he compels Stefan to stay in Mystic Falls to protect her, but also turns off his humanity. He also turns Tyler Lockwood into his first non-original werewolf-vampire hybrid. It is later found out that Klaus killed his own mother because she cast the spell on him that locked away his werewolf side and that therefore his step-father, Mikael, has been hunting him for centuries. After Damon un-daggers Elijah, who un-daggers Klaus' other half-siblings, and Bonnie Bennett and her mother are able to open up the tomb that holds Klaus' mother, Klaus is reunited with his entire family again. After saving Caroline Forbes' life by giving her his blood to heal her from Tyler's bite, he becomes interested in Caroline and invites her to the Original Vampires' ball, where they share a dance together. Bonnie later performs a desiccation spell to neutralize him, but he is later staked to death by Alaric. However, it is revealed that Bonnie cast a spell allowing him to inhabit Tyler's body. Thus forcing Tyler to leave his body. Then in the next season, Klaus forces Bonnie to put him back into his own body.\n\nAfter numerous near-death experiences, Klaus Mikaelson falls in love with the vampire Caroline Forbes and begins to court her. After many seasons it is revealed in 5x11 that Caroline feels much the same and they share an afternoon together consummating their feelings.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nKlaus must deal with a series of betrayals, personal growth, and the meaning of family in The Originals.\n\nKlaus is drawn back to the French Quarter of [[New Orleans]], a city he founded, and one he considered one of his best and greatest achievements before he was forced to flee from his step father's arrival. The group of witches who recalled him to the city inform Klaus that Hayley Marshall is carrying his unborn child, and make a deal with him: overthrow Marcel, the vampire king of New Orleans, in exchange for his unborn child's safety. Klaus, Marcel's sire and former adoptive family, had believed Marcel had been murdered and mourned him for years, while Marcel chose to use Klaus's absence to take the city for his own, instead of seeking the Originals out and rejoining their family. Klaus is devastated by this betrayal and theft, and vows to remove Marcel and retake the city.\n\nKlaus began life as a sensitive and artistic child who was singled out from all of his siblings by his father for the most horrific abuse. Even before the revelation of his mother's affair and Klaus's bastard status, Klaus was treated to extreme violence at the hands of the one he called father. As such, Klaus has very mixed feelings about his own child, and his future role as father, but eventually vows to protect Hayley and their baby no matter what and break the cycle of fatherly violence. Hayley and Klaus have no intention of rekindling what had been a one-night stand, but remain on amiable, if sometimes tense, terms, and Klaus has a tendency to be mildly possessive of Hayley and jealous of her affections for his brother, Elijah.\n\nKlaus becomes friends with Camille, a human bartender and grad student studying psychology. Camille has an understanding of Klaus's complexity, and is unafraid to call Klaus out on his rash behavior. Klaus treats her as a sort of confidant, and begins to see and unravel some of his destructive patterns.\n\nKlaus is extremely manipulative, and quick to use the most complex and devious of means to strong arm and force people to give him his way, believing they will always follow their most base, and selfish urges. This, combined with his paranoia, ease with violence, and tendency to be extremely controlling of those he actually likes, ensure that few of Klaus's good intentions ever turn out well or are perceived as good.\n\nRebekah, Klaus's younger sister and favorite, most-trusted sibling, betrays Klaus in a way he is not sure he can forgive, and deal with his elder brother, Elijah, trying to control and fetter him 'for his own good'. Klaus must also handle the betrayal of Marcel, whom he long thought of as a son, choosing to believe Klaus is a monster in need of vanquishing, and whom Klaus can never bring himself to kill.\n\nKlaus realizes that his scheming earns him numerous enemies, and he must pay the price once his daughter is born and those enemies wish to harm her. Klaus adores his child and swears to level all of his enemies who wish to harm her so that she can safely live with him.\n\nKlaus also discovers the werewolf half of his family line still exists, and must decide how to approach a relationship with them, and balance their needs with those of his vampire family, since werewolves and vampires are natural enemies and helping one is perceived as a threat to the other.\n\nIn the final episodes, Klaus transfers the Hollow into himself in order to save his daughter Hope with the plan to commit suicide using a white oak stake he has secretly kept for decades to destroy the Hollow and ensure the safety of his loved ones. After saying goodbye to those he cares about most, including Caroline, Klaus and Elijah, who decides to die with his brother, stake each other.\n\n====Powers and Abilities====\nAs the Original Hybrid, Klaus is the strongest of the Original vampires due to his Werewolf heritage giving him additional powers and advantages his half-siblings do not possess, making him the most physically powerful immortal being in the world, second only to Marcel Gerard. Klaus will grow stronger and faster when he is using his lycanthrope enhancements. His strength and speed will also increase during a full moon. His powers, including his strength and speed will be at their peak in his Werewolf form due to his werewolf heritage.\n\nIn Klaus's confrontations against the-then Enhanced Original Vampire Alaric Saltzman, his step-father Mikael, and the Upgraded Original Vampires Lucien Castle and Marcel Gerard respectively, the latters are apparently proven to be physically stronger than Klaus, however, in each of these confrontations, the Original Hybrid never truly used his full strength, as his physical attributes (such as strength and speed) are at their peaks when he is fully transformed into his werewolf form. It's possible that if Klaus were to transform into his Werewolf form, he might of been able to match Lucien, when he was still the Beast, in terms of speed.\n\nAlthough stronger than his Original Vampire maternal half-siblings due to his Werewolf heritage, some of his siblings like Elijah and Kol have displayed the ability to fight Klaus on almost equal terms, though not enough to defeat him as the latter always turns the tables with the use of his superior powers or skills. Both Elijah and Kol have been able to fight Klaus to a stalemate though unlike Kol, Elijah has been able to defeat Klaus once, whilst Rebekah has been easily subdued, though unlike Elija and Kol, Rebekah very rarely fights back. \n\nKlaus has shown to be an expert fighter such as when Marcel's army took him on, despite being overwhelmed to begin with, he was able to fight them and overpowered most of them, through his fighting skills and original hybrid powers. In that fight, he killed roughly twenty four non-original vampires single-handedly, showing his skills as a combatant.\n\nHis supernatural and physical attributes aside, Klaus' greatest asset is his sharp intellect. His penchant for strategies and forming contingencies way ahead of time and surpasses Elijah's penchant for strategies and forming contingencies; as he has outsmarted Elijah on several occasions and rarely is outsmarted by the latter. According to Dahlia, Klaus is the most intelligent of his maternal half-siblings.\n\n===Elijah Mikaelson===\n{{see also|Original Vampires (The Vampire Diaries)#Elijah Mikaelson}}\n* Played by [[Daniel Gillies]]\n* TVD recurring seasons: 2\u20134\n* TVD special guest starring season: 5\n* TO starring seasons: 1\u20135\n* Also played by Perry Cox (young Elijah) in seasons 1\u20132\n[[File:Daniel_Gillies_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg|thumb|100px|Daniel Gillies]]\nElijah Mikaelson is the second-oldest of the Original vampire siblings (and third-born child of Mikael and Esther).\n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nElijah first appears in episode eight of season two, entitled \"Rose\". Elijah is brought into the circle by two vampires named Rose and Trevor. They make a deal to be allowed immunity from Elijah and the Originals, if they hand over Elena Gilbert, the new Petrova doppleg\u00e4nger. It is later revealed that Rose and Trevor were the vampires who failed to keep Katerina Petrova (Katherine Pierce) alive for Klaus to sacrifice in the ritual required to release his werewolf abilities. They were subsequently hunted by Klaus and Elijah for centuries. Elijah had feelings for Katerina in 1492 (perhaps due to her resemblance to Tatia, The original Petrova, and the woman that nature-based the doppelg\u00e4nger curse off of when she was used to binding the Hybrid Curse back in the 10th Century) and tried to save her from Klaus; however, she did not trust Elijah and chose to flee. Later, he would punish her for her betrayal by compelling her to stay in a tomb until he said otherwise. Elena is rescued by the Salvatore brothers not long after Elijah kills Trevor, who had betrayed Elijah in the past by helping Katerina escape. The Salvatores attack Elijah and succeed in staking him; however, he comes back to life at the end of the episode because he is an Original vampire who can not be killed by any wooden stake. Elijah then works with a witch to locate Elena. The witch is able to locate her, so he goes to Mystic Falls to confront her, where he ends up saving her from a group of vampires who also wanted to take Elena. It is revealed that those vampires wanted to hand her over to Klaus. When Elijah discovers this, he makes peace with Elena and her friends, because he wants to use Elena as bait to draw out Klaus and kill him. He thus makes a deal with Elena that if she helps him kill Klaus, he will leave her friends alone. However, he also intends for Elena to be sacrificed as once Klaus breaks the curse and starts transforming, he will be left vulnerable enough to be killed. During a series of events, Elijah is temporarily \"killed\" when Elena stabs him with the dagger that can kill an original. When Klaus comes to town, Elena un-daggers Elijah because she needs his help, and he then reveals to her his family's history and the fact that Klaus killed the rest of his siblings. Elijah thus at first tries to help Elena and her friends kill Klaus, but ends up saving him instead in the season two finale episode, because Klaus promises to take Elijah to their family (which Elijah had assumed Klaus had hidden their \"dead\" bodies deep in the ocean) if Elijah spares him. In season three, however, it is revealed that Klaus double-crossed Elijah once again, and daggered him to keep him close to him, like the rest of his daggered siblings. Damon undaggers Elijah later to help him find a way to kill Klaus. When Elijah awakens, he undaggers the rest of his siblings who were located in coffins like his in the same room. They begin to plot their revenge against Klaus, however, before they can make their move, their thought to be dead mother Esther reappears and convinces the siblings to be a family again, which later turns out to be a front for her true motives. After Elijah foils his mother's plans to kill him and his siblings, he leaves Mystic Falls a tortured soul, ashamed of his own barbaric actions and those of his family's. He is shown to be one of the most sophisticated and peaceful of the Original siblings, alongside Finn. He is the most compromising regarding Elena and her friends. Elijah and Elena develop a sort of understanding during the series, and Elena comes to be fond of Elijah's company. She thus feels especially betrayed when earlier Elijah threatened to allow Rebekah to kill Elena if the Salvatore brothers are not able to stop Esther Mikaelson from killing the Original Family. However, in the 18th episode of season three, Elena professes that she hopes that her vampire friends are descended from Elijah's bloodline, so that he can be spared. Elijah returns to town in the season three finale episode, \"The Departed\", in order to make a deal with Elena and her friends. Elijah proposes that he be allowed to take Klaus's desiccated (by witch Bonnie and help from the Salvatores and Tyler) body with him and his siblings and leave town, and in exchange, he would make sure that Klaus would not be resurrected within Elena's lifetime or even that of her children, stating: \"perhaps that will teach him some manners.\" However, Klaus is staked, and Elijah and Rebekah believe him to be dead, even though Klaus actually possessed Tyler Lockwood's body and lives on.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nElijah follows his brother, Klaus, to New Orleans and is determined to keep his vow that they are family for forever and always, a sentiment Klaus occasionally resents, but has come to rely on.\n\nElijah meets Hayley, a werewolf carrying Klaus's unborn child, and feels an instant elation of hope that this child will be the salvation of Klaus and a means to draw their broken family back together again, and gives his word that Hayley and the child are family and under his protection. Elijah seeks to reestablish the family's home in New Orleans, as this was the time of their greatest happiness and concord.\n\nUnfortunately, Elijah is also immediately drawn to Hayley herself. Hayley returns his interest, but Elijah tries to subdue his attraction out of respect for Klaus.\n\nElijah spends most of his efforts attempting to control Klaus and keep all of his bickering family members in line. Klaus and Elijah have something of a symbiotic relationship: Elijah offers the unconditional love Klaus craves, while Klaus represents the possibility that, if Klaus can be saved, so can Elijah, while offering a fertile ground for Elijah's caretaker tendencies.\n\nElijah is often criticized for always siding with Klaus, and frequently suffers consequences for doing so. Despite his oath to stand fast with Klaus, Elijah often assumes the worst of his brother, and is quick to cause Klaus to suffer, especially physically, if it means sparing others (usually their sister, Rebekah, or Hayley).\n\nWhile he is considered the \"honorable\" one, who always keeps his word and behaves with impeccable decorum in the formal suits he only wears, Elijah is just as brutal as his brother. He also tends to be domineering, controlling, and smothering to those he considers under his care, and sometimes becomes frustrated and annoyed with Klaus keeping Elijah from what Elijah wants. Elijah must learn to loosen his rigid control, trust his family more, and be selfish every once in a while in order to find a healthier happiness.\n\nElijah eventually finds himself as the de facto king of the city, since Klaus does not like to trouble himself with the minutia of everyday rule, and must attempt to broker peace between all of the warring factions or, pending failure, destroy them all in order to make the city safe for his family and new niece.\n\nIn season four, Elijah is killed by an ancient evil known as the Hollow as part of its resurrection plan, ending his bloodline. Elijah's family manages to resurrect him, but those descended from Elijah remain dead.\n\nIn the series finale, Klaus reveals that, after taking in the Hollow, he intends to commit suicide using a white oak stake he has kept in secret for decades to end the Hollow's threat and ensure the safety of his loved ones. Elijah convinces his brother to say a proper goodbye and then reveals that he intends to die with Klaus whom he feels has been fully redeemed so that they can go on to whatever comes next together. Klaus and Elijah stake each other and die together, taking with them the Hollow.\n\n===Rebekah Mikaelson===\n{{see also|Original Vampires (The Vampire Diaries)#Rebekah Mikaelson}}\n* Played by [[Claire Holt]]\n* TVD recurring seasons: 3\u20135\n* TO starring season: 1\n* TO special guest starring seasons: 2\u20135\n* Also played by Callie McClincy (young Rebekah) in seasons 1\u20132\n[[File:Claire_Holt_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg|thumb|100px|Claire Holt]]\nRebekah Mikaelson is Klaus and Elijah's younger sister and also an original vampire. Rebekah shares a deep bond with her brother Klaus, and was the only family member that remained loyal to him despite his vicious behaviour. Klaus thus kept her by his side, while he kept the rest of his family staked and stored away in boxes for hundreds of years.\n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nRebekah had a romantic interest in Stefan Salvatore during their encounters in the early 1920s. However, when Klaus and Rebekah were once again forced to go on the run after the arrival of their vengeful father Mikael, Rebekah professed an interest to stop going on the run and live a stable life with Stefan by her side. Klaus subsequently forced her to choose between him and Stefan, and she chooses the latter. Klaus then daggers Rebekah.\n\nHe brings her back to life during the period in which the show takes place, in order to obtain her necklace (which was originally Esther's). The same necklace had been given to Elena by Stefan in season one. Rebekah and Klaus thus head to Mystic Falls. Rebekah develops a deep hatred and envy of Elena, and continually tries to hurt, kill, and emotionally distress her, until her brother makes her stop. Later on, Rebekah is once again daggered by Elena, to simplify the Salvatores' plans of killing Klaus. Elena makes a deal with Klaus for her to reveal Rebekah's location, while Klaus promises not to harm Jeremy. He takes her body with him. She is eventually un-daggered by Elijah. During her time in Mystic Falls, Rebekah enrols at the local high school, much to the disgust of Elena and her friends. There, she at first makes romantic advances towards Tyler Lockwood, Caroline Forbes's boyfriend. She later develops a fondness for Matt Donovan, and invites him to her family's ball. Rebekah is shown to be lonely and insecure, though she hides this by being cruel and violent. This is demonstrated quite well through her sexual rendezvouses with Damon Salvatore, an enemy of her family, and the subsequent torture she makes him endure upon being betrayed by him. Rebekah's body is temporarily taken over by her witch mother, Esther, through a spell performed by Esther. She invades Rebekah's body in order to be able to go unnoticed while scheming to kill all of her Original children. Esther later leaves Rebekah's body and stakes her. However, Klaus restores Rebekah to full vitality by removing the stake. In the season three finale, while Matt is driving Elena back to Mystic Falls, after trying to escape with her, Rebekah is seen standing in the middle of Wickery Bridge. Matt sees her, loses control, and drives the car into the lake, which ultimately results in Elena's death and subsequent transformation into a vampire.\n\nIn the season four premiere, Rebekah is captured alongside every other vampire in Mystic Falls. While en route to their detainment, Caroline is rescued by Klaus, inhabiting Tyler's body, but leaves his sister there. While locked up, Rebekah realises that Elena is in transition but hasn't fed on human blood, which she is delighted about because \"I get to watch you die all over again.\" However, as she sits in her cell, she listens to Elena and Stefan's heartfelt confessions of regret and love to each other with a conflicted look on her face. Rebekah then helps Stefan kill one of their guards, allowing Elena to feed on his blood and complete the transition into a vampire. After being released, Rebekah storms home and confronts Klaus, now back in his original body. Rebekah, in tears and furious, tells him how she always loved him despite everything he has done but he doesn't love or care for her as a sister. Rebekah then destroys the last few bags of Elena's blood, preventing him from creating more hybrids. In retaliation, Klaus disowns Rebekah, telling her he does not love her and she is not his sister anymore and breaks her neck. Rebekah leaves Klaus' mansion and moves into her own house. She befriends April Young, an orphan who moves back to Mystic Falls after her father is killed in an explosion. She is then asked by Stefan to tell him and Klaus the story of the Five and the cure for vampirism. After Klaus and Stefan find out what they need from her, Klaus daggers Rebekah and has Stefan hide her.\n\nLater, April learns from Caroline where Rebekah is and un-daggers her. With April's help, Rebekah takes Elena, Stefan and Caroline prisoner so that she can learn what progress they have made in finding the cure. After toying with them and finding out what she wants, she releases them. Stefan later approaches her where she states she still wishes to find the cure so she can use it on Klaus. Stefan then proposes the two work together to get the cure since they are the only two without an edge since Klaus has the sword, Damon is with Jeremy, and Bonnie is working with Professor Shane. In the episode \"A View to Kill\" Rebekah and Stefan work together to find the headstone of the first immortal creature. She then convinces him to stop caring about Elena and the two have sex.\n\nThroughout season four, Rebekah is shown to be interested in Matt Donovan but he is not interested in her. Near the end of the season, the four spend more time together and appear to be friends. Whilst Rebekah is on a test to see if she could be human Matt tells her that she would not be a good human because she is not a good person. Later on, Rebekah saves April's life, changing Matt's view of her. In the season four finale, Rebekah and Matt kiss while Matt is being held hostage and Rebekah saves his life, taking his place and allowing him to leave in order to attend graduation. Matt then develops some feelings for Rebekah and agrees to spend the summer travelling the world with her, saying that whatever happens on the road stays on the road. About three months after she returns from touring the world with Matt she returns to Mystic Falls in order to help Matt when he is buried alive by Nadia.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nDuring the first season of ''The Originals'', Rebekah returns to New Orleans in order to find and assist her brother, Elijah, who had come after their troubled brother, Klaus.\n\nRebekah is reluctantly roped into staying and playing happy families by Elijah, who wants the siblings to repair their relationships and welcome their newest member: Klaus's child. Rebekah eventually grows fond of Hayley, the child's mother, but Rebekah's increasingly contentious and sniping relationship with Klaus begins to crescendo.\n\nRebekah's main source of contention with her brother Klaus is his overbearing and controlling tendencies getting in the way of Rebekah's fondest desires: namely to start a family of her own with someone who loves her absolutely and be 'free'. Unfortunately, Klaus has a very low opinion of Rebekah's taste in men and has consistently killed every man Rebekah has ever fallen in love with, and daggered Rebekah into a forced sleep for decades as punishment for trying to leave Klaus. Rebekah has, therefore, come to fear, hate, and resent Klaus, even as she tries to honor Elijah's wish that they become a complete family once again.\n\nKlaus's opinion of Rebekah's ability to choose a partner worthy of her turns out to be generally accurate, and she is drawn to Marcel, Klaus's ward. As a test, Klaus daggers Rebekah into sleep and offers Marcel a deal. Marcel does not choose Rebekah, and she is left asleep for half a century. Despite this, the two rekindle their relationship in secret several times, with Rebekah harboring the hope that the two of them will flee her brothers' control and live happily elsewhere, since she has little hope of Klaus giving his approval.\n\nRebekah is therefore very conflicted to find that Marcel, whom she believed to be dead for nearly a century, has been alive and thriving as King of New Orleans, and has new women in his life whom he loves. Rebekah is hurt Marcel never bothered trying to find her and chose power over her love.\n\nTrapped in the cycle of an on-again-off-again relationship with Marcel, Rebekah grows increasingly bitter about the control the men in her life (Marcel and her two brothers) have over her. She attempts to gain some freedom and revenge by fomenting plots of her own with a skill that rivals her brothers', but tends to fail when her desire to be loved undermines her desire to escape her family, and the men in her life show their willingness to go to worse depths than she.\n\nUltimately, Rebekah falls from her place as the perfect and innocent sister when her past betrayal of Klaus at the prompting of her resentment and Marcel's encouragement is revealed. When Klaus proves her fears and expectations wrong; Marcel chooses something else over her yet again; Elijah lets her go; and Rebekah is accepted as a flawed individual, Rebekah realizes she can leave and be as free as she likes, which she does with happiness.\n\nAt the end of season one, Rebekah returns to New Orleans. Klaus, with no other options, gives Rebekah his new daughter, baby Hope. He tells her the only person he trusts to keep her safe is her. She leaves town with baby Hope.\n\nRebekah appears in the opening scene of season two, where we see here telling Hope a story while taking care of her.\n\nLater in season two, Rebekah is back with Hope, afraid her mother has found them. She talks to Elijah and notices something is wrong him and proceeds to find out he killed a diner full of people for no good reason (as a result of their mother forcing memories and nightmares upon him in an attempt to get him to agree to becoming mortal) so she snaps his neck in order to protect Hope from him, she then takes both Hope and Elijah to a new location where she reunites with Hayley and Klaus and the five of them take part in their Bonfire tradition. To protect Hope, she volunteers to lure their mother by faking to accept her deal. She comes to see Esther, talks to her and shares wine as they agree on the spell. As the ceremony begins, she notices the white oak stake that shouldn't be there and wants to call the spell off as their mother lied to them. She still suffers the spell and doesn't wake up in her body, but before the spell she managed to drop some of her blood into her mother's wine glass making her mother a vampire when Klaus killed her. She is now trapped in a witch's body, locked in a mansion because of Kol's revenge on her (when she betrayed him back in 1914).\n\nIn the series finale, Rebekah becomes engaged to Marcel and plans to take the cure so she can become human and die naturally, living the life she always wanted.\n\n===Hayley Marshall===\n* Played by [[Phoebe Tonkin]]\n* TVD recurring season: 4\n* TO starring seasons: 1\u20135\n[[File:Phoebe_Tonkin_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg|thumb|100px|Phoebe Tonkin]]\nHayley Marshall (born Andr\u00e9a Labonair) is a cresent werewolf. \n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nHayley sets off to find Tyler when she hears from one of Klaus's hybrids, who was from a pack she used to run with, talking about protecting him. She surprises Tyler when she shows up to his house unannounced, something Tyler is clearly happy about. While they talk, Hayley mentions helping Tyler break his sire bond. She chastises him for lying about his real identity; apparently, he had told her he lived in a trailer park in Florida. Hayley seems annoyed by this but quickly forgives him. When Caroline shows up and Tyler leaves the room to talk to her, Hayley meets Klaus who appears to talk to her. Klaus overhears Tyler and Caroline's conversation and Tyler makes an excuse about staying home, not mentioning Hayley. Klaus assumes that Tyler and Hayley had a fling, which Hayley does not deny. When Tyler comes back, he finds Hayley has gone and Klaus tells him she left. Klaus then speculates that Tyler and Hayley may have hooked up, although that hasn't been confirmed. Tyler only let Klaus believe something happened between them to distract him from Tyler's plan to break the sire bonds of the other hybrids. Hayley eavesdrops on a conversation between Tyler and Dean when Caroline shows up and meets Hayley. Hayley tells Caroline she's been staying with Tyler since she needs a place to stay, and that they're good friends. Caroline is clearly irritated that a strange girl is staying at her boyfriend's house when she knew nothing about it, but Hayley doesn't seem bothered by Caroline's irritation. Hayley excuses herself to join Tyler and Dean's argument about whether Dean should obey Klaus's order to deal with Connor or not. After Dean's death, Tyler comforts Hayley, which again irritates Caroline. Tyler later explains that he and Hayley plan to help all of Klaus's hybrids break the sire bond. Tyler finds Hayley, Chris and some other hybrids drinking in honour of Dean. Hayley keeps up the ruse that there is something romantic going on between her and Tyler by sensually wiping alcohol from Tyler's lip, knowing Klaus is witnessing it. Soon after, Caroline arrives and stages a breakup with Tyler in front of Klaus, after which he leaves with the hybrids. Once Klaus is gone, Hayley, Tyler and Caroline smile at one another, and Caroline thanks Hayley for telling her that Klaus was there. Hayley watches Tyler and Caroline kiss, smiling slightly.\n\nLater, Tyler tells Stefan about Hayley and that she helped him and Chris break their sire bonds, also revealing that they plan on unsiring all the hybrids from Klaus. That night, when Chris is about to leave Tyler's house, Klaus appears and berates Chris for failing to keep Elena secured. Tyler tries to cover for him, but Hayley intervenes to claim that she let Elena out and stands up to Klaus, daring him to kill her instead. Klaus apparently lets Chris go, but when Jeremy and Stefan arrive Klaus allows Jeremy to chop off Chris's head while Hayley and Tyler watch in horror. After Chris's death, Hayley is passed out the next morning next to Tyler on a sofa; they had clearly spent the entire night drinking in honour of Chris. After Caroline and Tyler argue she is abruptly awakened when Tyler throws a glass bottle and it explodes against the wall. Hayley is in an abandoned barn helping Kimberley break her sire bond when Tyler arrives, saying Caroline got them another day by agreeing to go with Klaus to the Miss Mystic Falls Pageant. Hayley suggests that they go to keep up the ruse that she is the reason Caroline and Tyler broke up, and Tyler reluctantly agrees. Caroline and Klaus see Hayley and Tyler arrive, which seems to upset Caroline. Hayley mocks the pageant by donning the tiara intended for the winner. Later, Damon and Tyler see Hayley talking to Shane and Damon wonders aloud how he knows her. Tyler assures him she doesn't, but Damon's suspicion seems to plant doubt in Tyler's mind. Later, when Tyler is sitting with Hayley, she asks if he got the wolf gene from his mother, claiming his mother knows how to party as she is seen drinking a lot and doesn't appear too drunk. He tells her he got the gene from his dad and asks her about her parents. She tells him she never knew her real parents and that she triggered the gene by accidentally killing someone in a boating accident while she was drunk. Tyler subtly asks if she knows Shane, but she claims she doesn't.\n\nLater that night, after Tyler calls Hayley to tell her that Kimberley broke the sire bond, Hayley is in Shane's office and tells him they freed another one. She emphasises that she doesn't want Tyler to have anything to do with whatever they are planning. When Hayley is helping Adrian break the sire bond, Kimberley interferes and frees him before they finish. Later, she breaks into Shane's office, and when he arrives she reveals that her deal with Shane was to get him twelve hybrids, unsired from Klaus, in exchange for information about her parents. Shane threatens to include Tyler in the twelve if she doesn't manage to break Adrian's sire bond so Hayley encourages Tyler to take the role of alpha and give Adrian orders to go through with it. He follows her advice, but Kimberley retaliates by kidnapping and torturing Caroline. Later, after Tyler has forced the hybrids to submit to him and Adrian has finally broken his sire bond, Hayley reports to Shane that they have their twelve hybrids. In return, Shane gives her a flash drive with information about her parents, informing her that they are dead but reassuring her that she can see them again. He cryptically tells her that it's far from over and that they are just the beginning. During the Winter Wonderland charity event, Tyler tells Caroline that Hayley has found a powerful witch who can use a spell to transport Klaus into someone else's body. When he reveals that he has volunteered to house Klaus's essence and be buried in concrete, Caroline, after much tension with Tyler and the hybrids, eventually has the idea that they should use Rebekah's body instead. Worried about changing the plan, Hayley texts Shane about having problems, but he merely tells her to fix it. Hayley then snaps Caroline's neck and tells Klaus about Tyler's plan. While Klaus is killing Tyler's pack, Hayley explains to Tyler that she made a deal with someone who can help her find her real family and that her end of the bargain was to provide twelve unsired hybrids for the sacrifice. She warns Tyler that he should leave town to escape Klaus's wrath. She then flees herself. Hayley's whereabouts were unknown until Vaughn \u2013 a hunter \u2013 reveals to Damon and Rebekah that Katherine got her information about Silas from Hayley when they crossed paths in New Orleans.\n\nIn \"Bring It On\", Hayley is attacked by a vampire named Will who was sent by Katherine to kill her. Klaus appears and saves her, in the process biting and poisoning the vampire with his werewolf venom. Klaus then takes Hayley to his mansion, where he plays the hospitable host in order to glean information about Katherine. He politely interrogates Hayley, though she claims she does not know where Katherine is. She tells Klaus that Katherine found her in New Orleans when she was trying to find her real parents and Katherine told Hayley she could help her. Klaus claims that he is the only one who can protect Hayley from Katherine's minions, and says that he will as long as she cooperates with him. Hayley goes into the next room and looks at Klaus's paintings, expressing distaste for all but one, which she describes as twisted. She asks Klaus why he paints and in response he describes painting as a metaphor for control. Hayley calls him out on his attempts to soften her up before mentioning Klaus's plans to kill Tyler. Klaus assures her that the better punishment is sentencing Tyler to a lifetime of paranoia and fear. Hayley then reveals to Klaus that the reason he has been unable to find Katherine all these centuries has been her ability to build and maintain a network of allies willing to do anything for her. Klaus asks Hayley if she knows any of Katherine's allies, and she responds teasingly that she might know a couple and she might even tell him about them. Later, after Damon has killed Will, Klaus offers to let Hayley stay anyway. She suggests a deal: her intel in exchange for Tyler's freedom, but Klaus cannot bring himself to make any promises when it comes to Tyler. Hayley draws him back in by returning to what he said about his paintings and control and tacitly offers him control with her. He takes the bait and they have sex. Afterwards, while Hayley is dressing, Klaus notices a mark on Hayley's back that, according to him, is only found on those of a certain bloodline of werewolves originating in Louisiana.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nHayley returns in \"The Originals\" where in Mystic Falls, Katherine tells Stefan and Damon that Hayley was what they needed to rid Klaus from their lives for good. In New Orleans, Hayley is told by a witch named Jane-Anne that in the bayou the wolves were named \"Roux-Ga-Roux\". Jane-Anne shows her an area on a map saying it'll give her what she is looking for. Hayley heads towards the area while Jane-Anne and Sophie prepare to do a spell on her. While Jane-Anne does the spell, Hayley's car breaks down and when seeing other people come to her she passes out with Sophie and the other witches of the Quarter circling her. Later it is revealed by Elijah and Sophie, that she is pregnant with Klaus's child.\n\nDuring the first season of ''The Originals'', Hayley had troubles coping with her pregnancy and initially tried to abort this baby but eventually came around to it. She also has feelings for Elijah, who also has the same feelings. Her story arc mainly involves her helping some Werewolves at a Bayou after Marcel got a witch to put a curse on them that would keep them in their wolf form unless it was a full moon, but this curse later got broken after Celeste used a spell to break it. Hayley is also trying to track down the real identities of her birth parents, who are revealed to have been the alphas (royal family) of the Bayou werewolves, known as the Crescent Packs, before their deaths making little Hayley the Princess of the Crescent Packs and next-in-line to lead the pack. Hayley also meets Jackson Kenner, another alpha werewolf whom her parents had betrothed her to when she was a baby hoping them to be the future King and Queen of the Crescent Packs. Throughout the first season, Hayley develops strong friendships with Rebekah Mikaelson and even Klaus somewhat and starts developing romantic feelings for Elijah Mikaelson, which he reciprocates.\n\nShe is killed by Monique Deveraux in the finale \"From a Cradle to a Grave\" after giving birth to her daughter, Hope; she later awakens in transition to a hybrid because the blood of her hybrid daughter remained within her system. She went to the graveyard to help Klaus and Elijah find Genevieve and her baby. She later stabs and kills Genevieve as revenge for trying to kill her daughter. Afterwards, she, Klaus, and Elijah agree that the best way to protect Hope is to send her away while they \"clean up the mess that [they've] made\". Hayley uses her grief over giving her daughter to Rebekah as a ruse to convince everyone in New Orleans that her daughter was killed.\n\nIn the second season, Hayley is struggling to adapt to her new hybrid status, feeling grieved over not having her daughter, enraged at the witches who tried to kill her baby and disgusted at having to live like a vampire and drink blood. Hayley and Elijah have also grown distant, as she believes he sees her the way she sees herself, as a monster, and becomes closer to Klaus when he helps her reconnect with her werewolf side. Hayley later learns that, if she marries Jackson in a mystical werewolf ritual, the entire Crescent pack will gain her hybrid ability to transform at will, thus ending their allegiance to the witches and giving protection to Hope, which would allow her to come back home to her parents. Hayley ultimately decides to go through with the wedding, even if it means ending any chance of a romantic future with Elijah. At this point, Hayley and Jackson call on the alpha werewolves of several neighboring packs to sign away their alpha statuses to Hayley and Jackson and accept them as their new alphas. This would mean the respective werewolves of each ex-alpha's pack would become part of the Crescent pack under Hayley and Jackson's leadership and all these werewolves would be able enjoy Hayley's gifts following the marriage ritual. Hayley begins developing feelings for Jackson, creating a sort of family with him, Hope, and the pack, which is now bigger and more powerful than ever. However, when the Mikaelsons' aunt Dahlia threatens to take Hope away from them as part of a pact she made with her sister Esther (Klaus and Elijah's mother), Hayley decides to flee with Jackson and Hope, earning Klaus's enmity. He curses her to be a wolf for every night except that of the full moon for six months, as punishment for attempting to take their daughter away from him.\n\nIn season three, Hayley's curse is broken by Davina so that she can kill a witch who was angered by Davina's status as regent. After a violent fight with Klaus, Hayley was eventually reunited with Hope, and is able to stay in an apartment across the street with her and Jackson. Her constant desire to help the Mikaelsons, and Elijah in particular, causes a rift between her and Jackson, who feels that Hayley is choosing them over him. They manage to reconcile at Christmas, when Jackson accepts that the Mikaelsons are her family as much as he and Hope are. Unfortunately, Tristan de Martel and his Strix vampires attack and abduct Jackson and Hayley in the Bayou the next day, as leverage against the Mikaelsons. Tristan, in revenge for Hayley helping Elijah torture him earlier in the season, rips Jackson's heart out in front of Hayley, seconds after he had proclaimed his unending love for her. This loss deeply grieves Hayley, who spends the next few weeks in a deep depression as she copes with her husband's death. Eventually, Hayley is able to regain some semblance of her former self, proving instrumental in saving Klaus and Elijah from the Strix and the de Martel siblings (though not before Klaus's sireline was broken). Hayley additionally begins taking her grief over Jackson's death out on the members of the Strix who played a hand in his death, starting with Aya. Eventually, the killings garner the attention of the remaining Strix, and Elijah is forced to intervene, killing the rest of Hayley's potential victims in order to throw others off her trail. Hayley then confesses to him that she has always loved him, yet due to guilt over Jackson's death, she decides to leave New Orleans with Klaus and Hope, in an attempt to get over her feelings for Elijah. Eventually, she returns and helps defeat Lucien and Aurora as they attempt to kill the Mikaelsons, though her friends Camille and Davina also perish. Hayley eventually begins a relationship with Elijah towards the end of the season, which is later disrupted by Marcel's quest for revenge over Davina's death. Hayley is the only member of the family left standing, with Elijah, Kol, Freya, and Rebekah under a sleeping spell with Klaus held hostage by Marcel as the anchor. She and Hope both leave New Orleans in an attempt to grow up away from the drama and find a cure for the family, only to return five years later. \n\nIt is important to note that, due to the way in which Hayley became a hybrid, she is not linked to any of the Originals. As such, if the Originals were to be destroyed, hence wiping out all vampires, Hayley would be the only vampire left on Earth. It is unknown what would happen to any vampires she sires if she is destroyed, though given the nature of her transformation, it is possible that they would survive. It is also unknown if Hayley is linked to her daughter, Hope, in the same way that vampires were linked to the Original that founded the line.\n\nIn season 5, Hayley begins with just her and Her daughter Hope as the end on season 5 the family had to split up due to, if they were to all be in the same room as Hope, Hope would get the holos magic again and it will kill her. Klaus gets led back to New Orleans as Hayley has gone missing; later it has been confirmed that Hope is the cause for the disappearance but she did it so she could see her father. \n\nHayley\u2019s body is not where Hope had placed her and her friends and family set out to find her, although she is not found until episode 6. It was shown that she had been tortured for being a hybrid, a witch performs magic which makes Hayley no longer a hybrid but only a vampire. Hayley\u2019s death was painful, she had ripped Greta\u2019s finger off (which had the daylight ring on) and grabbed her before running into the sun and both burning to death. \n\nHayley is seen again when Hope goes unconscious later on and it is seen that Hayley is at peace with her parents, other family members and Jackson. In the series finale, Hayley can be seen watching over her daughter as Klaus sacrifices himself to destroy the Hollow for good.\n\n===Marcel Gerard===\n* Played by [[Charles Michael Davis]]\n* TVD guest starring season: 4\n* TO starring seasons: 1\u20135\n* Also played by McCarrie McCausland (young Marcel) in seasons 1\u20132\n[[File:Charles_Michael_Davis_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg|thumb|100px|Charles Michael Davis]]\nMarcellus \"Marcel\" Gerard is Klaus' former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a vampire that he turned in the early 1800s.\n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nMarcel appears in the backdoor pilot of ''The Originals''.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nMarcel was born a slave and the bastard son of a plantation owner during the 1800s. Klaus rescued Marcel as a boy, saving him from whipping and essentially raising Marcel as a welcome and loved part of the Mikaelson family. Marcel's feelings towards the Originals are complex. As a child, Marcel was grateful for their intercession, had a slight hero worship for Klaus, and swore he would grow up to marry Rebekah. As an adult, Marcel resents being made to feel like a secondary member of the family, and that their abilities will always be greater as Originals. Growing up in such an unusual environment was also traumatizing for young Marcel, who witnessed many acts of arbitrary violence.\n\nKlaus refused to turn Marcel, believing it would ruin Marcel's innocence and turn him into a monster, and further objects to a romantic relationship between Rebekah and Marcel, offering Marcel the following deal: live with Rebekah for the remainder of Marcel's mortal life with Klaus's blessing, or be turned and give Rebekah up. Marcel chose being turned over Rebekah and allowed her to remain in stasis for half a century without rescue. Still, Klaus refused to turn Marcel until Marcel forced Klaus's hand while dying.\n\nPower, revenge for the injustices of his early childhood, and an obsession with outstripping and one-upping the Mikaelson's, especially Klaus, for never feeling like a true member of the family are Marcel's primary motivating factors. Marcel has a complete ban on harming children, and will often step in if he sees them mistreated or used as he was. Marcel has perhaps an even greater capability for violence, deception, and cruelty than Klaus. But, unlike Klaus, Marcel is charismatic, likable, and diplomatic, making others more willing to listen to and like Marcel as a leader, despite his swift willingness to turn on those closest and most loyal to him if it would be to his own benefit. Marcel's charm and the Mikaelson sibling's affection for him (and therefore reluctance to kill him), are Marcel's greatest assets.\n\nAfter the Originals were forced to flee New Orleans in 1919, Marcel chooses to take over the city and declare himself as king in the power void, rather than informing his adoptive family that he is still alive. Marcel is a popular king, who keeps the vampires happy with parties, rewards systems, and the promise of earning a Daylight Ring once they reach his inner circle. Marcel successfully subdued and drove out the werewolves using a curse, placates the humans with promises of a low death count and limiting attacks to tourists, and recently came into possession of a super weapon that allows him total control of the witches, banning them from using magic. All supernatural factions must follow the set of rules and edicts issued by Marcel. Marcel takes extreme pride in his ability to run the French Quarter under exclusive vampire rule, and enjoys that he is better-liked than Klaus.\n\nConflict arises when the Originals return to the city and feel betrayed by Marcel's deception and what Klaus views as the theft of one of his proudest achievements: the city of New Orleans. All three siblings begin to work against Marcel. Klaus is envious of Marcel's success and the apparent love and loyalty of Marcel's followers, and swears to take what he considers rightfully his and punish Marcel for allowing Klaus to mourn for him. Rebekah is angry that Marcel betrayed their relationship and moved on with no regrets. And Elijah will always be most loyal to his original siblings, and seeks to support their desires and recreate the time when they were happiest: during their rule of New Orleans.\n\nThe deciding lynch pin for who will ultimately take the city is a young, 16 year old witch, named Davina. Believing Davina was intended as a human sacrifice, Marcel, who again dislikes any mistreatment of children, slaughtered the witch community and rescued a grateful Davina. Davina has immense power, enough to subdue an Original, and aids Marcel in quest of controlling the city. Marcel comes to love Davina and feels extremely protective and proprietary towards her, putting her into his care and under his protection.\n\nOnce Davina is removed from the equation, Klaus openly declares his intention to retake his city and Marcel is forced to resentfully relinquish his rule in the face of Klaus's demonstration that everything Marcel has built is worthless in the face of Klaus's abilities as the Original Hybrid . Klaus, lonely and wishing for companionship, requests Marcel remain as his co-ruler, which Marcel happily accepts while plotting with Rebekah to take power back, and rubbing it in Klaus's face that Klaus will never be loved as a king.\n\nEventually, Marcel betrays both Rebekah, who wished Marcel would finally choose her, and Klaus, revealing that Marcel was the source of betrayal that led them to flee the city in the first place. Elijah banishes Marcel from the city as a consequence and takes de facto control.\n\nMarcel becomes obsessed with taking back rulership and begins using guerrilla warfare tactics to incite a civil war among the city's supernatural factions and undermine Elijah's peace treaties. Marcel is especially opposed to Elijah's proposals since they grant power to the witches and werewolves, whom Marcel had formerly subjugated in favor of the vampires. The conflicts result in the death of Marcel's friend, Thierry, which incites Marcel to higher heights of violence. The Originals are still fond enough of Marcel to be reluctant to kill him, but their reservations for restraint become strained, eventually running out during a battle when Marcel rallies all of the vampires in New Orleans to attack the Mikaelson compound and stop the creation of Moonlight Rings, which would allow the werewolves power. Elijah proves he is more than capable of handling the entire population of vampires by himself, while Klaus easily subdues and bites Marcel. Already weakened by Elijah, all of Marcel's vampires are quickly finished off by the werewolves, and Marcel must find a way to lure Klaus back to the compound and bleed him in order to cure his friends.\n\nMarcel saves the life of Klaus's baby and uses her to bring Klaus back to the compound, only to find that he is too late. Marcel apologizes for his previous betrayal, and grateful for Marcel's interference and newly united against their common enemies, the witches and the werewolves, Klaus extends friendship and the two return to being allies. Marcel subdues his ultimate goals, to transcend Klaus and take back New Orleans, in order to gain the Original's help destroying the werewolves.\n\nMarcel once again finds himself at war with the Original clan when Davina dies for another time and Marcel is desperate to resurrect her. The plan fails due to interference and Marcel blames all of the Mikaelson's, vowing revenge. Marcel maintains that Klaus is a true monster, and not Marcel. In \"Give 'Em Hell Kid\", Marcel becomes an Enhanced Original Vampire after Elijah kills Marcel out of fear of a prophecy without knowing Marcel had taken the serum.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Give Em Hell Kid|episodelink=|series=The Originals|serieslink=The Originals (TV series)|airdate=May 13, 2016|season=3|number=21}}</ref>\n\nWith this new power, Marcel is finally stronger than the Originals and believes he would make a more benign and just ruler, having come to believe that the Mikaelson's are corrupt, egotistical monsters, unlike himself. Despite now having the ability to not only kill the Originals, but kill them all at once, Marcel Gerard \"allows\" the Mikaelson family to live in exchange for the city, and Klaus's eternal punishment of being pinned with a dagger that causes continuous pain and walled into the compound.\n\nAfter Freya saves the Mikaelson's five years later they manage to rescue Klaus and Marcel agrees to let them live in exchange for the family leaving the city. However, the threat of the Hollow forces Marcel to reluctantly ally himself with the Originals once again against the greater threat. After the defeat of the Hollow, Klaus makes amends with Marcel, apologizing for failing Marcel as a father.\n\nIn the series finale, Marcel resumes his relationship with Rebekah as Klaus prepares to sacrifice himself to destroy the Hollow once and for all. Having put aside their differences, Marcel is devastated by Klaus' coming demise and joins the family in celebrating his life, promising to be there for Hope if she ever needs him. Marcel decides to leave New Orleans for good and take the remaining vampires with him, leaving the city to the humans. Rebekah proposes to Marcel, revealing that she intends to travel to Mystic Falls and take the cure so she can finally live out a human life as she has always wanted. Despite the fact that he will one day lose her to old age, Marcel accepts her proposal and they set out together to live a new life.\n\n===Sophie Deveraux===\n* Played by [[Daniella Pineda]]\n* TVD guest starring season: 4\n* TO starring season: 1\nSophie Deveraux is a witch, antagonist, and a main character in Season 1 of ''The Originals''.\n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nSophie appears in the backdoor pilot of ''The Originals''.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nIn the past, she was a light-hearted girl who enjoyed partying and didn't care much for witchcraft. However, 8 months before the start of the series, she watched her niece, Monique Deveraux, die in The Harvest, a sacrificial ritual that allows the witches in New Orleans to draw power from their ancestors. After that, she became more serious, obsessed with the goal of killing Davina so she can complete the ritual and bring her niece back from the dead. Sophie has made it clear that she will do whatever it takes to reach her goal, which makes her dangerous to have as an enemy. She was later killed by Monique.\n\nShe was linked to Hayley for a short period of time while Hayley was pregnant. This was to allow her to bargain with the Original Vampires. This meant that all that happened to Sophie also happened to Hayley. This caused a near miscarriage for Hayley. Just before Hayley miscarried Davina unlinked Sophie and Hayley, allowing Hayley's pregnancy to continue.\n\n===Camille O'Connell===\n* Played by [[Leah Pipes]]\n* TVD guest starring season: 4\n* TO starring seasons: 1\u20133\n* TO guest starring season: 4\u20135\n[[File:Leah_Pipes_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg|thumb|100px|Leah Pipes]]\nCamille \"Cami\" O'Connell is a bartender who is fascinated by the question of whether people can be born bad.\n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nCamille appears in the backdoor pilot of ''The Originals''.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nAfter an unimaginably tragic event in her family, Camille became a psychology student in order to study human behaviour, in the hopes of proving that people can't just be \"evil\". Her fixation on the subject might just help her bond with Klaus, though Camille is unaware that her corner of New Orleans is crawling with supernatural beings who walk the line between good and evil. She is also fascinated and shares a love-hate relationship with Klaus, who has feelings for her. She also had a brief romance with Marcel, but that was only short lived. Her uncle Kieran falls under a hex, when he goes mad from the hex, Camille has Klaus turn Kieran into a vampire in hopes of curing the hex. When it doesn't work, Kieran, going crazy and in transition, tries to kill Camille. Klaus saves her and kills Kieran. After her uncles' death, she gets a key, to an apartment her uncle owned. She discovers a secret room filled with supernatural weapons and books.\n\nIn season two, Camille tries to focus on her studies and meets with her new counsellor, who is none other than Finn Mikaelson in Vincent's body. Later, she discovers the truth about him and allies with the vampires and the werewolves to help them take him down because she feels that he's got a crush on her. She's part of their plan to capture Finn and on a date with him, she lures him into an isolated alley where she gets attacked by a werewolf, which was Hayley. Later in the church, Cami is recovering with Hayley's blood and when Finn is down thanks to Jackson's arrows, she handcuffs him. On the same night, she is seen drinking in her bar when Esther comes and put a spell on her. On the next days, she doesn't recall Esther's spell and finds out when Hayley shows her. She seeks help from Davina, Kol, Marcel and Klaus only to find out from Finn that Esther has been preparing her to welcome Rebekah in her body. As Finn doesn't want to help her, she waits for Esther's spell but is successfully protected by Davina and is still controlling her body.\n\nIn season three, Cami is turned into a vampire by Aurora de Martel (Klaus's ex-girlfriends) out of jealousy; because Aurora is jealous of Klaus's affection towards Camille, Camille was later bitten by Lucien Castle, after he became an Upgraded Original Vampire, also known as the Beast, Klaus, Elijah and Freya try to find a cure for Lucien's venom, they even try to use his blood to cure Camille, only to find out that the Beast's blood cannot cure his own venom. Camille later dies peacefully in Klaus's arms, much to the latter's grief. Her death is avenged by Klaus.\n\n===Davina Claire===\n* Played by [[Danielle Campbell]]\n* TO starring seasons: 1\u20133\n* TO recurring season: 4\n* TO guest starring season: 5\n[[File:Danielle_Campbell_at_PaleyFest_2014.jpg|thumb|100px|Danielle Campbell]]\nDavina Claire is a nineteen-year-old witch with a dark side (16 at the beginning of series). Born late 1994-early 1995 in New Orleans. She's still learning the full extent of her powers and has Marcel as her protector. Davina is in hiding from the witches of the Quarter as they would want to kill her to complete The Harvest. In the meantime, her powers are too much for her to handle and can result in a disaster if they were to get out of control. Finally, she was sacrificed for the sake of New Orleans. Unfortunately, when she died her powers didn't go back to the Earth since they were stolen by Celeste. Following the death of Celeste, Davina was revived. In the final episode of season one, Davina brings Mikael Mikaelson (father of Originals) back from the dead and tethers him to a bracelet that she controls.\n\nIn season two, Davina tries to find a way to unlink Marcel's and Josh's destiny to Klaus' so that Mikael can kill him. In a disc shop, she meets Kaleb and begins to bind with him, unaware he's Kol Mikaelson. She still has Mikael under her control and when on a date with Kaleb they get attacked by the werewolves searching for the white oak stake, she summons him to help them and Elijah against the wolves. Because Elijah (and so Klaus) found out about Mikael being back, Davina runs off to hide in a cabin. She asks Mikael to teach her how to defend herself and be stronger but gets hurt and calls Kaleb to help her heal. Klaus finds her and attacks them, and she gets hit on the head. When she wakes up, Mikael is gone because Kaleb has unlinked her to him. She tries to finish her spell to unlink Marcel's and Josh's life to Klaus' and as she wants to channel Kaleb powers to get stronger, she discovers the truth about him being Kol and unlinking her to Mikael. So she wants to destroy the white oak stake and unable to do it, she allies with Kol to disable it for a moment. Davina manages to get the stake back and then runs off with Kaleb, still searching how to get her revenge on Klaus. They agree on stabbing him with some dark knife Kol has kept over the years, and then putting on a coffin so that Marcel and Josh won't die. She wakes up one morning and finds out that Kol and the white oak stake are missing so she goes to Marcel and Josh to tell them. She apologizes for believing Kol was faithful to her but Marcel tells her he kidnapped Kol with the stake to get them to Klaus. Davina manages to avoid Josh's surveillance and goes to Kol's secret lair. After using a spell, she confronts Klaus with the hopes to make him angry so that he would bite her and become poisoned. Later she has to revive him when she learns that Cami is in danger and Kol is on Marcel's and Klaus' side to take Esther down. She helps Cami by successfully protecting her from Esther's spell and on the side, she continues plotting with Kol to create the dagger to take Klaus down.\n\nIn season 3, she joined the Strix's coven known as the Sisters in order to bring back her lover Kol Mikaelson. After successfully resurrecting Kol, she is killed by him when the Ancestors took control of him. However, at the end of season 4, a powerful witch called 'The Hollow' revives Davina to manipulate Kol to help her. With the help of Hope, Kol is able to successfully save Davina from 'The Hollow'. After saying goodbye to Josh, Davina and Kol decide to leave New Orleans to see the world. In the last episode of season 4, Kol has a diamond engagement ring made, intending to propose to Davina.\n\nIt is mentioned in the first episode of season 5 that Kol and Davina did indeed get married and are living together in Belize.\n\n===Vincent Griffith===\n* Played by [[Yusuf Gatewood]]\n* TO recurring seasons: 1\u20132\n* TO starring seasons: 2\u20135\nVincent Griffith is a very powerful witch, who is the former Regent of the Nine Covens and a current member of the Trem\u00e9 Coven. He was formerly married to Eva Sinclair.\n\n===Freya Mikaelson===\n{{see also|Original Vampires (The Vampire Diaries)#Freya Mikaelson}}\n* Played by [[Riley Voelkel]]\n* TO recurring season: 2\n* TO starring seasons: 3\u20135\n* LG special guest season: 2\n* Also played by Elle Graham (young Freya) in TO season 2\nFreya Mikaelson is the firstborn child of Mikael and Esther, the eldest sister of Finn, Elijah, Kol, Rebekah, and Henrik, the maternal older half-sister of Niklaus, and the paternal aunt of Klaus' daughter with Hayley Marshall, Hope. She is a main character on ''The Originals''. Freya was born in the late years of the 10th century to a Viking warrior named Mikael and his wife Esther. Her parents had met after her mother was captured during a Viking raid, and fell in love before marrying. Freya was their first born child. Her birth was a result of a deal her mother made with her aunt, Dahlia, who used magic to make the barren Esther able to have children of her own. She was, according to Esther, the apple of Mikael's eye. However, when she was five, Freya was taken by her aunt as part of Esther's deal when Esther was pregnant with Elijah and her life following that is a mystery. Esther claimed that she was the victim of a plague in order to cover up what she and Dahlia had done, which is what caused Mikael and Esther to move from Norway to a village in a \"mystical land\" far away in the New World, which was later called Mystic Falls.\n\nThey moved there under the advisement of Esther's dear friend and mentor, a witch named Ayana, who told them that the inhabitants were extremely healthy and had increased strength and speed. These villagers were later revealed to be werewolves. In the modern day, Freya was mentioned by Elijah, when he explained to Elena that his mother and father had seven children, and again by Rebekah, when she told Elena the story about how her family ended up in Mystic Falls. Rebekah explained that their parents had lost a child in Europe to the plague and that later, Esther, Mikael, and Ayana moved to Mystic Falls, where Mikael and Esther eventually had the rest of their children, excluding Finn and Elijah, who were born in the Old World. It was also said that Freya's death is what made Mikael become so cruel and abusive, as she was his favourite child.\n\nIn Wheel Inside the Wheel, it was revealed that Freya had not been killed by the plague, but was instead given to Dahlia as payment for reversing Esther's infertility and allowing her to have her children. The payment was stated that Esther was to give Dahlia Freya, the first born child of each of her children, and every subsequent first born child for as long as Esther's line will last. Dahlia used a spell to increase her power, while also binding Freya's power to Dahlia's. Freya lived under Dahlia for many years, ostensibly as a member of her coven, but in reality, Freya was more of a slave. Dahlia poisoned Freya's mind, telling her that her mother did not want her and that Dahlia was all she had. When Dahlia learned that Esther had turned her children into the first vampires, and thus ended her bloodline, the weight of carrying on Dahlia's plans fell onto Freya, who swore that she would never fall in love or have a child, in order to spare any child the fate of being Dahlia's. When Dahlia attempted to cast her pseudo-immortality spell on both of them, Freya at first resisted, only to have Dahlia force it on them. For centuries they existed, slumbering for a century while their ageing arrested and their power magnified, to then live for a single year.\n\nFreya met and fell in love with a man named Mathias, and a child was conceived between them. They attempted to escape from Dahlia, however, she easily tracked them down and placed a death hex on Freya's lover. Depressed and in pain, Freya drank from a deadly poison in an attempt to kill both herself and her unborn son, so that they could both be free from Dahlia. However, much to her horror, she discovered that part of the immortality ritual was a powerful protection spell that prevented them from being killed, however, as the spell was not cast upon Freya's child, he was truly lost, leaving Freya a sobbing mess in Dahlia's arms.\n\nIn 1914, she befriended Kol and was his \"date\" during a Christmas party at the Abattoir to get a glimpse of her family. Rebekah, recognising Freya as the witch that Kol had brought to the party to accompany him, approached her and insisted that she could do better than Kol. Freya told her that it wasn't really a date before Rebekah made to join the rest of the Mikaelsons and Marcel on the staircase for Klaus' speech. This marked the first time that the two Mikaelson sisters had met in their lives, and Rebekah remained unaware that she had met her older sister until a century later when they both escaped from the witch asylum together. During Klaus' speech, Kol and Freya toasted each other from across the room, but the cheerful and festive night quickly took a dramatic turn when Klaus publicly condemned Kol's treachery and she witnessed Kol getting daggered by Klaus. She later went into the Dowager Fauline Cottage, seeing it as the safest place to be during her century of sleep and because she knew her aunt wouldn't come there.\n\nEntering a deep sleep that lasted a century, she awoke 100 years later where she discovered that her sister, Rebekah, had been imprisoned in the Asylum in the body of a young witch. Posing as an inmate, she witnessed Rebekah's confrontations with the Kindred and Cassie's betrayal. Using her magic, Freya saved Rebekah from the Kindred and broke the spell on the Asylum, freeing herself and Rebekah.\nWhen Freya reunites with her brother Finn, he informs her of Hope's life, which inspires Freya (who wishes take revenge against Dahlia for the deaths of her lover and son) so she can kill her as Dahlia would come for her niece, so she affiliates herself with her siblings. In the end of hard long magical struggle (resulting in the death of both her parents), Freya and her younger siblings finally managed to defeat Dahlia, with Freya's finally winning her younger brothers trusts (especially Niklaus), and moving into their house as Hope's caretaker and an official Mikaelson sibling.\n\nAfter a few months of peace in the supernatural community in NOLA, troubles started again with the arrival of Lucien Castle, Klaus's first progeny, and his warnings of war between the sire-lines, and so, Freya's enormous magical powers were needed again to protect her family from harm.\n\nFreya once again showcased her great skill and power in the season three series finale. Freya, looking for a way to save her family quickly and uniquely, adapts two ancient spells to save her siblings. In order for her spell to work, she utilised Esther's linking spell, binding each sibling, including herself, to Klaus, while she replicated her aunt Dahlia's immortality slumber spell, (replicated for the first time in over 10 centuries). She also took a page from Finn's spell book and drew everyone, save Klaus, into a Chambre de chasse, so that they could be a family while slumbering, in order to escape death (while Klaus lived and suffered). That was the only way to save herself and the others until Hayley found a cure to their ailments. As of this moment, Freya is now once again immortal since she is now linked to Klaus, who became the anchor to her spell. The slumber spell acts as a protection against all forms of harm; therefore, Elijah and Kol will not die from Marcel's bite and Freya will not succumb to the fatal toxin. Rebekah is currently no longer suffering from the insanity hex since she was pulled into the Chambre de chasse.\n\nShe is later married to Keelin, a werewolf.\n\n===Josh Rosza===\n* Played by [[Steven Krueger]]\n* TO recurring seasons: 1\u20134\n* TO starring season: 5\nJoshua \"Josh\" Rosza is a vampire. He is one of Marcel's top right-hand men as well as out-and-proud homosexual. As a human, he was best friends with a girl named Tina. Josh went to New Orleans with Tina and was invited to a party that was hosted by Marcel. Josh and Tina were subsequently attacked by vampires and were severely injured. Klaus discovered vampire blood in their systems and ultimately snapped their necks. The next day, Marcel flipped a coin; the winner would remain as a vampire and the other would be killed. Tina ended up grabbing the coin, but the exercise was revealed to be a test of loyalty; she failed. Tina was killed, and Josh was allowed to live on as a vampire.\n\nIt was later revealed that right after Josh turned up in New Orleans and had vampire blood in his system, Klaus Mikaelson broke his and his friend's neck to create spies for himself against Marcel and his empire. Once Josh completed his transition into a vampire, Klaus compelled him to be his spy, his eyes and ears. Josh seemed to be an effective spy for him by helping him drain a vampire off vervain and framing Marcel's best friend Thierry. But after his compulsion was removed by Davina, he betrayed Klaus and sent him to an ambush. After that, he has laid low and stayed hidden from Klaus.\n\nJosh met Davina after Marcel discovers Klaus' compulsion upon him, he requests Davina to free him in order to work as his spy. Josh is initially fearful of her although warms up to her after they bond over music, whilst Davina works her painful spell. After Josh's compulsion is lifted, they laugh over their differing views of \"normal\" and they are both noticeably sad when Marcel wants Josh to forget her. They \"pinky promise\" that Josh would keep her secret in exchange to keep his memories, as he says it's nice to talk to somebody again. Whilst Josh is stuck in the shadows without a daylight ring, he is expressively fearful of Klaus and Davina promises to protect him.\n\nIn season two, Josh meets Aiden in the episode 'Live and Let Die', when Josh is living at Marcel's loft with the rest of the new vampires, checking his cell phone. Marcel asks him about any prospects and Josh informs him that there is this one guy he's been messaging with and that he really likes him. When Marcel asks what the problem is, Josh then expresses doubt about having any kind of normal relationship on account of his need of blood to survive. Before the conversation can go any further, someone is thrown through the window. The loft is suddenly swarmed by werewolves wearing Moonlight Rings. Aiden is revealed to be a werewolf and the leader of this attack group of wolves. Aiden tells Marcel that the deal of the vampires staying out of the Quarter is over and that the vampires must leave New Orleans entirely. To prove his point, Aiden has one of the other werewolves bite a vampire. When another goes for Josh, Aiden calls them off and warns Marcel that they need to be gone when they come back, because he won't call them off next time.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Josh is at Bywater Tavern, glancing at his phone and looking a little nervous, when Aiden comes in and it's revealed that he is the guy Josh has been messaging on the dating app. After a brief conversation, the two decide to pretend they're not at war for the night and just be themselves.\n\nIn the episode ''Chasing the Devil's Tail'', Josh is at Marcel's loft with Aiden, Hayley and Marcel as they all outline a plan to take out Vincent. Cami soon shows up with a box full of dark objects that are able to take down a witch. Josh makes a joke of it, \"Sweet it's a big box of dusty old junk. We're saved\", which Aiden laughs at. At this point, Josh and Aiden begin seeing each other romantically and in secret, worried about their respective groups finding out about their vampire-werewolf, same-sex romance that might threaten both of their lives.\n\nIn the episode ''Gonna Set Your Flag on Fire'' when the rest of the vampires and werewolves are trapped at Marcel's compound by a witch's spell, Josh and Aiden fully acknowledge their love for each other. A short while later, Josh confides in Marcel about his romance with Aiden who reacts supportive to it. At the same time, Jackson tells Aiden about him being aware of Aiden's involvement with Josh, a vampire, and cautions him about proceeding with it.\n\nIn the episode ''I Love You, Goodbye'' Josh finally decides to go public with his romance with Aiden when they both attend Hayley and Jackson's wedding at Marcel's compound when he and Aiden sit side by side. In episode 'City Beneath the Sea', Aiden is brutally murdered by Dahlia who sets it up to make it look like Klaus murdered him by tearing out his heart in an attempt to further divide the werewolves and vampires against each other. Josh and Davina find his body later, which devastates him. In the next episode, Josh attends Aiden's funeral in the bayou alongside the other werewolves despite the tensions still lingering between the two supernatural groups.\n\nIn Season 4, it is revealed that he is dating a human named Eddie (played by [[Keahu Kahuanui]]).\n\nIn the missing years between seasons 4 and 5, Josh remains in New Orleans, trying to maintain the peace between the vampires, wolves and the witches, along with the help of Freya and Vincent. When a group of purist vampires start killing halfbreeds, including Hayley Marshall, Marcel returns to the city, and Josh and Vincent work with him to keep the city safe. When Marcel is lured into a trap by the purists who want to extract the venom from his fangs, Josh successfully rescues him, but is injected with Marcel's venom during a fight. He dies moments later in Marcel's arms. He is later seen reunited with Aiden in the afterlife, after having spent 15 years apart.\n\n===Hope Mikaelson===\n{{see also|Original Vampires (The Vampire Diaries)#Hope Mikaelson}}\n* Played by uncredited infant actors (seasons 1\u20133), Summer Fontana (season 4), and [[Danielle Rose Russell]] (season 5, ''Legacies'' season 1)\n* TO guest season: 1\n* TO recurring seasons: 2\u20134\n* TO starring season: 5\n* LG starring season: 1\u2013present\nHope Andrea Mikaelson, sometimes referred to as Hope Marshall, is Klaus Mikaelson and Hayley Marshall's extremely powerful daughter who, apart from being a vampire-werewolf hybrid, is also a witch of the Mikaelson bloodline, one of the most powerful witch lineages in the fictional universe of the series. Moreover, her vampire side is that of an Original vampire, making her almost invincible and more powerful than average vampires and her werewolf side is that of an alpha werewolf, through Hayley, making her royalty among the werewolves, the Princess of the Crescent pack.\n\nOriginally at her school, the Salvatore Boarding School, she is referred to as Hope Marshall to keep her identity as Klaus' daughter secret to reduce her chances of becoming the target of one or more of his many enemies. However, by the time ''Legacies'' premiered this was retconned and everyone at the school knows her real name and her lineage. An integral part of the launch of ''Legacies'', Hope finally showed that she is more than her darkened lineage, until that is she threw herself into Malivore to save Landon and the world, erasing herself from existence.\n\n==Recurring characters==\nThe following is a list of characters that are, or at one time were, a recurring guest on the series.

3\u20134\n* TO guest starring season: 1\n* TVD guest starring season: 5\n* TO recurring seasons: 2\u20134\n* Also played by Roman Spink (young Kol) in season 2\n[[File:Nate Buzolic.jpg|thumb|100px|Nathaniel Buzolic]]\nKol Mikaelson is the youngest son of the Original Family, since the death of his younger brother Henrik and the second youngest child still living, being older than Rebekah.\n\n====In ''The Vampire Diaries''====\nHe tries to kill Matt Donovan for entertainment during the Originals' family ball but is stopped by Damon Salvatore.\n\nIn the season three episode, \"Heart of Darkness\", Kol appears in Denver, Colorado, where Elena and Damon had sent Jeremy, to get him away from Mystic Falls and protect his life. He threatens to hurt Jeremy, in order to prevent Elena and Damon from trying to find out the history of Damon's blood line, (if they managed to do so, they might find out that Elena's friends are not descended from Kol, which would allow them to kill him). Damon drives a baseball bat through Kol's body in order to debilitate him so that he, Elena, and Jeremy can escape. Kol later appears at the house of Mary Porter, the vampire who sired Rose. Kol kills Mary, so that she is not able to tell Elena and Damon about the history of her bloodline, which could lead them to find out which Original vampire Damon, Stefan, Caroline, Tyler, and Abby Bennett are descended from, (Mary sired Rose, Katherine Pierce forced Rose to sire her, and Katherine later sired Damon and Stefan; Damon sired Caroline, Abby, and Elena).\n\nIn season four, Kol returns to aid Rebekah in finding the rumored \"cure\" for vampirism. He tortures Professor Shane, who supposedly knows how to get the cure. When Kol realizes that Shane plans to release Silas, the first and most dangerous immortal being of all time, Kol stabs Shane through the torso with a wooden object, killing him. However, Bonnie is able to save Shane's life through an \"expression\", or dark magic spell.\nKol compels Damon to kill Jeremy so that they cannot find Silas, but Stefan locks Damon away so that he cannot.\n\nElena and Jeremy decide to try and kill Kol because he is trying to stop them from getting the cure. Since Jeremy needs to kill vampires to complete the map to the cure, they conclude that if they kill Kol, which also kills his whole line of vampires, the map will be complete.\nElena lures Kol into the house and waits for Jeremy to bring Bonnie, but he does not make it in time. Elena and Jeremy are talking later when Kol appears, storms into the house and tries to cut off Jeremy's hunting arm. Elena rescues Jeremy and corners Kol in the kitchen. During the altercation, Jeremy showers Kol in water mixed with vervain. While Kol is stunned, Jeremy stabs him with the white oak stake and he dies. Meanwhile, Klaus is watching in the doorway, furious, unable to help his brother because he has not been invited in. He vows to avenge his brother's death, swearing to kill Jeremy, Elena and anyone else involved.\n\n====In ''The Originals''====\nIn season one, Kol's corpse appears, stabbed, on the ship that brought the Mikaelsons to New Orleans.\n\nIn season two, Kol returns in the body of a young Witch named [[#Kaleb Westphall|Kaleb Westphall]], along with his brother Finn and their mother who returned at the end of season one. Kol wants revenge on his brothers Klaus and Elijah and helps his mother with her plans. He starts by getting close to the witch Davina, earning her trust and showing her his powers. But he becomes attached to her and hides information from his mother (the return of Mikael). Klaus discovers Kaleb's true identity in Red Door. Kol/Kaleb spends most of his time with Davina to get the white oak stake for his mother. Kol tells Davina about his past, about all the magical objects he's collected over the years and the plan he's been thinking of; to dagger Klaus and to lock him in a coffin.\n\nWhen Davina falls asleep, he is captured along with the white oak stake by Marcel and brought back to Klaus and Elijah. Marcel and Klaus, convince him to participate in the plan to take Esther down. But Kol has still something on his mind since 1914 when he tried to steal a \"Fauline diamond\" to create the dagger. During that era, Kol was involved with a witch named Mary-Alice Claire and taught her magic, most notably being the technique known as Kemiya. When he stole the diamond, he asked Rebekah to be part of his plan but after she agreed, he found out she betrayed him by telling Klaus. Klaus daggered him with the help of Elijah. Klaus also trapped his girlfriend and her friend in a mansion.\n\nIn present day, as their mother performs her spell, Kol gets his revenge by transferring Rebekah into a witch's body trapped in the mansion. He now has everything he needs: he got the diamond back as part of the deal to ally against Esther, Klaus will be occupied looking for Rebekah and Davina will be helping him for the dagger. \nDavina convinces Kol to help her rescue a captured Josh. Unfortunately, that leads to Kol being cursed by Finn during the rescue mission. Finn curses Kol to die in a few days.

There were as many as five different Athabascan languages spoken in the area in 1868 when the French-Canadian Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Mercier established the first fur trading-post in the area. Noukelakayet Station, later known as Fort Adams, was located on the north bank of the Yukon, about 15 miles downstream from the mouth of the Tanana River.<ref>Mer\u00e7ier, Fran\u00e7ois Xavier.

In 1898 the U.S. Army, under the leadership of Capt. P.H. Ray, founded Ft. Gibbon at the present location of Tanana.  Ft. Gibbon's purpose was to oversee shipping and trading, maintain civil order, and install and take care of telegraph lines connecting to Nome and to Tanana Crossing, on the way to Valdez.  All other Euro-American activities in the area near the Tanana-Yukon confluence moved upriver to accommodate Ft. Gibbon and the increased steamboat traffic caused by gold seekers.  St. James Church moved to the present site of Tanana to serve the Euro-American population, and the Mission of Our Savior was constructed at the bottom of a hill opposite the confluence. The mission site became a center of activity for indigenous people in the area.  Ft. Gibbon closed in 1923, but the town and mission remained.\n\nIn the 1930s a regional hospital was built in Tanana, and the Native Village of Tanana was officially chartered by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1939. The hospital served people throughout most of the rural northern regions of Alaska until 1982. During World War II  Tanana's airfield was one of the stops for aircraft en route to Russia as part of the Lend-Lease program. Postwar, a [[White Alice Communications System|White Alice]] communications site was built on a hill nine miles behind Tanana, as a part of the Cold War Era's Distant Early Warning system (DEW-Line). Also during the 1950s the mission closed and the indigenous families still living at the mission site moved down to the main town.<ref>Alaska Department of Commerce.

In 1900, the community first reported as Tanana. It would formally incorporate in 1961.\n\nAdjacent to Tanana on the west side was the military installation of [[Fort Gibbon]], which reported 181 residents in 1920. It would be deactivated in 1923 and later annexed into Tanana. To the east side of Tanana was the Saint James Mission in 1900, later called Mission of Our Savior in 1910 (also known as the Tanana Native Village). It reported separately from Tanana on the 1900-1940 censuses (1900: 161 residents; 1910: 114; 1920: 99; 1930: 96; 1940: 75).

Calhoun Memorial Airport]] located at the Western edge of the city, 1 mile from the city center. The only airline that regularly flies to Tanana is [[Wright Air Service]] based in [[Fairbanks]]. Boat transport on the river is possible in summer. Tanana is served by a one-lane dirt road, which connects Tanana to the [[Elliott Highway]] in [[Manley Hot Springs]]. The road ends about 6 miles upstream from the town, but an ice road is constructed when the river freezes.

There were as many as five different Athabascan languages spoken in the area in 1868 when the French-Canadian Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Mercier established the first fur trading-post in the area. Noukelakayet Station, later known as Fort Adams, was located on the north bank of the Yukon, about 15 miles downstream from the mouth of the Tanana River.<ref>Mer\u00e7ier, Fran\u00e7ois Xavier.

In 1898 the U.S. Army, under the leadership of Capt. P.H. Ray, founded Ft. Gibbon at the present location of Tanana.  Ft. Gibbon's purpose was to oversee shipping and trading, maintain civil order, and install and take care of telegraph lines connecting to Nome and to Tanana Crossing, on the way to Valdez.  All other Euro-American activities in the area near the Tanana-Yukon confluence moved upriver to accommodate Ft. Gibbon and the increased steamboat traffic caused by gold seekers.  St. James Church moved to the present site of Tanana to serve the Euro-American population, and the Mission of Our Savior was constructed at the bottom of a hill opposite the confluence. The mission site became a center of activity for indigenous people in the area.  Ft. Gibbon closed in 1923, but the town and mission remained.\n\nIn the 1930s a regional hospital was built in Tanana, and the Native Village of Tanana was officially chartered by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1939. The hospital served people throughout most of the rural northern regions of Alaska until 1982. During World War II  Tanana's airfield was one of the stops for aircraft en route to Russia as part of the Lend-Lease program. Postwar, a [[White Alice Communications System|White Alice]] communications site was built on a hill nine miles behind Tanana, as a part of the Cold War Era's Distant Early Warning system (DEW-Line). Also during the 1950s the mission closed and the indigenous families still living at the mission site moved down to the main town.<ref>Alaska Department of Commerce.

In 1900, the community first reported as Tanana. It would formally incorporate in 1961.\n\nAdjacent to Tanana on the west side was the military installation of [[Fort Gibbon]], which reported 181 residents in 1920. It would be deactivated in 1923 and later annexed into Tanana. To the east side of Tanana was the Saint James Mission in 1900, later called Mission of Our Savior in 1910 (also known as the Tanana Native Village). It reported separately from Tanana on the 1900-1940 censuses (1900: 161 residents; 1910: 114; 1920: 99; 1930: 96; 1940: 75).

The [[population density]] was 26.6 people per square mile (10.3/km\u00b2).  There were 166 housing units at an average density of 14.4 per square&nbsp;mile (5.5/km\u00b2).

The average household size was 2.55 and the average family size was 3.43.\n\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 34.7% under the age of 18, 6.5% from 18 to 24, 28.2% from 25 to 44, 22.1% from 45 to 64, and 8.4% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 131.6 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 128.4 males.\n\nThe [[median income]] for a household in the city was $29,750, and the median income for a family was $34,028. Males had a median income of $30,781 versus $23,500 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $12,077.  About 16.4% of families and 23.0% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 15.0% of those under the age of 18 and none of those 65 or over.\n\n==Education==\nThe [[Tanana City School District]] serves area residents.\n\n==Transportation==\nTanana is served by the [[Ralph M. Calhoun Memorial Airport]] located at the Western edge of the city, 1 mile from the city center. The only airline that regularly flies to Tanana is [[Wright Air Service]] based in [[Fairbanks]]. Boat transport on the river is possible in summer. Tanana is served by a one-lane dirt road, which connects Tanana to the [[Elliott Highway]] in [[Manley Hot Springs]]. The road ends about 6 miles upstream from the town, but an ice road is constructed when the river freezes.
