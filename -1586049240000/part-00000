He carried out missionary activity among the [[Bulgarians]], and was so successful that they requested him for their bishop.  Nicholas refused his permission, because an appointment in Bulgaria would require Formosus to leave his see in Porto, and the fifteenth canon of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] forbade a bishop to leave his own [[Episcopal see|see]] to administer another.\n\nIn 875, shortly after [[Charles the Bald]]'s imperial coronation, Formosus fled Rome in fear of then-pope [[Pope John VIII|John VIII]].  A few months later in 876, at a synod in Santa Maria Rotunda, John VIII issued a series of accusations against Formosus and some of his associates.  He asserted that Formosus had corrupted the mind of the Bulgarians \"so that, so long as [Formosus] was alive, [they] would not accept any other bishop from the apostolic see,\"<ref>John VIII, JE 3041, ed. E.L.E.

He also legislated more generally against those who \"plunder\" ecclesiastical goods.<ref>The council ''acta'' do not survive, but the proceedings are described by Hincmar,''Annales'', entry for 878, ed. in Monumenta Germaniae Historica ''Scriptores'' vol.

He resumed his bishopric at Porto, where he remained until elected pope on 6 October 891.<ref>D\u00fcmmler, Auxilius und Vulgarius, p. 6 nn. 5 and 6</ref>  Yet this earlier quarrel with John VIII formed the basis of the accusations made at the Cadaver Synod.  According to the tenth-century historian [[Liutprand of Cremona]], Stephen VI asked Formosus' corpse why he \"usurped the universal Roman See in such a spirit of ambition\" after the death of John VIII, echoing John VIII's own assertion that Formosus had tried to seize the papal throne while he was alive.<ref>Liutprand, ''Antapodosis'', I.30, ed. in [[Corpus Christianorum]]: Continuatio Medievalis, vol 156, p. 23, lines 639-43</ref> Two further accusations were also made against Formosus at the Cadaver Synod: that he had committed perjury and that he had attempted to exercise the office of bishop as a layman.<ref>Council of Ravenna in 898, ''acta'' edited by J.D. Mansi,''Sacrorum conciliorum, nova, et amplissima collectio'', vol. 18, col. 221</ref> These are related to the oath Formosus is said to have sworn before the council at Troyes in 878.\n\n==Immediate context==\nThe Cadaver Synod is generally presumed to have been politically motivated. Formosus crowned [[Lambert of Spoleto]] co-ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 892; Lambert's father, [[Guy III of Spoleto]], had earlier been crowned by John VIII.<ref name=\"williams\">Williams, George L. 2004. ''Papal Genealogy: The Families and Descendants of the Popes''. McFarland & Company. {{ISBN|0-7864-2071-5}}. p. 10.</ref>  In 893 Formosus, apparently nervous about Guy's aggression, invited the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] to invade Italy and receive the imperial crown.  Arnulf's invasion failed, and Guy III died shortly afterwards.  Yet Formosus renewed his invitation to Arnulf in 895, and early the next year Arnulf crossed the Alps and entered Rome, where Formosus crowned him as [[Holy Roman Emperor]].  Afterwards the Frankish army departed, and Arnulf and Formosus died within months of each other in 896. Formosus was succeeded by [[Pope Boniface VI]], who himself died two weeks later.  Lambert and his mother, the empress [[Angiltrude]], entered Rome around the time that [[Pope Stephen VI|Stephen VI]] became pope, and the Cadaver Synod was conducted directly afterwards, at the beginning of 897.\n\nThe dominant interpretation of these events until the early twentieth century was straightforward: Formosus had always been a pro-Carolingian, and his crowning of Lambert in 892 was coerced. After the death of Arnulf and the collapse of Carolingian authority in Rome, Lambert entered the city and forced Stephen to convene the Cadaver Synod, both to re-assert his claim to the imperial crown and perhaps also to exact posthumous revenge upon Formosus.<ref>Cf., for example, Duchesne, ''Les premiers temps de l\u2019\u00e9tat pontifical'' (Paris, 1904), p. 301; and the detailed account in the old ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06139b.htm Pope Formosus]</ref>\n\nThis view is now considered obsolete, following the arguments put forth by [[Joseph Duhr]] in 1932.  Duhr pointed out that Lambert was in attendance at the [[Ravenna Council of 898]], convened under [[Pope John IX]].  It was at this proceeding that the decrees of the Cadaver Synod were revoked.  According to the written ''acta'' of the council, Lambert actively approved of the nullification.  If Lambert and Angiltrude had been the architects of Formosus\u2019s degradation, Duhr asked, \u201chow [...] was John IX able to submit to the canons which condemned the odious synod for approbation of the emperor [i.e., Lambert] and his bishops?  How could John IX have dared to broach the matter [...] before the guilty parties, without even making the least allusion to the emperor\u2019s participation?\u201d<ref>Joseph Duhr, \u201cLa concile de Ravenne in 898: la r\u00e9habilitation du pape Formose,\u201d ''Recherches de science religieuse'' 22 (1932), p. 546</ref>  This position has been accepted by another scholar: Girolamo Arnaldi argued that Formosus did not pursue an exclusively pro-Carolingian policy, and that he even had friendly relations with Lambert as late as 895.  Their relations only soured when Lambert's cousin, [[Guy IV of Spoleto]], marched on [[Benevento]] and expelled the Byzantines there.  Formosus panicked at the aggression and sent emissaries into Bavaria seeking Arnulf's help.<ref>Girolamo Arnaldi, \u201cPapa Formoso e gli imperatori della casa di Spoleto,\u201d ''Annali della facolt\u00e0 di lettere e filosofia di Napoli'' 1 (1951), p. 85ff. Portions of this view had been argued earlier by G. Fasoli, ''I re d\u2019Italia'' (Florence, 1949), 32ff</ref>  Arnaldi argues that it was Guy IV, who had entered Rome along with Lambert and his mother [[Angiltrude]] in January 897, who provided the impetus for the synod.<ref>Arnaldi, \"Papa Formoso,\" p. 103</ref>\n\n==The synod==\n[[File:Tafel paepste.jpg|thumb|The list of popes buried in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] includes the recovered body of [[Pope Formosus]]]]\n\nProbably around January 897, Stephen VI ordered that the corpse of his predecessor Formosus be removed from its tomb and brought to the papal court for judgment. With the corpse propped up on a throne, a [[deacon]] was appointed to answer for the deceased pontiff.\n\nFormosus was accused of transmigrating sees in violation of canon law, of perjury, and of serving as a bishop while actually a layman. Eventually, the corpse was found guilty.  Liutprand and other sources say that, after having the corpse stripped of its papal vestments, Stephen then cut off the three fingers of the right hand that it had used in life for blessings, next formally invalidating all of Formosus' acts and ordinations (including his ordination of Stephen VI as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Anagni-Alatri|bishop of Anagni]]). The body was finally interred in a graveyard for foreigners, only to be dug up once again, tied to weights, and cast into the [[Tiber|Tiber River]].\n\nAccording to Liutprand\u2019s version of the story, Stephen VI said: \"When you were bishop of [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Porto-Santa Rufina|Porto]], why did you usurp the universal Roman See in such a spirit of ambition?\u201d<ref>\u201cQuo constituto...formosum e sepulcro extrahere atque in sedem Romani...collocare praecepit. Cui et ait: \u2018Cum Portuensis esses episcopus, cur ambitionis spiritu Romanam universalem usurpasti sedem?\u201d Liutprand, Antapodosis, I.30 (CCCM 156, p. 23, ll. 639-43). Liutprand of Cremona\u2019s is perhaps the most convenient account of synod, though many additional details are furnished by the pro-Formosan Auxilius. Cf. D\u00fcmmler\u2019s edition, Auxilius und Vulgarius (Leipzig, 1866), chs. IV (p. 63ff) and X (p. 70ff) especially.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2008}}\n\nThe macabre spectacle turned public opinion in Rome against Stephen. Rumors circulated that Formosus' body, after washing up on the banks of the [[Tiber River|Tiber]], had begun to perform [[miracle]]s. A public uprising led to Stephen being deposed and imprisoned. While in prison, in July or August 897, he was strangled.\n\nIn December 897, [[Pope Theodore II]] (897) convened a synod that annulled the Cadaver Synod, rehabilitated Formosus, and ordered that his body, which had been recovered from the Tiber, be reburied in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[pontifical vestments]]. In 898, [[Pope John IX|John IX]] (898\u2013900) also nullified the Cadaver Synod, convening two synods (one in Rome, one in [[Ravenna]]) which confirmed the findings of Theodore II's synod, ordered the ''acta'' of the Cadaver Synod to be destroyed, [[List of excommunicated cardinals|excommunicated seven cardinals]] who were involved in the Cadaver Synod, and prohibited any future trial of a dead person.\n\nHowever, [[Pope Sergius III]] (904\u2013911), who as bishop had taken part in the Cadaver Synod as a co-judge, overturned the rulings of Theodore II and John IX, reaffirming Formosus's conviction,<ref>Williams, 2004, p. 11.</ref> and had a laudatory epitaph inscribed on the tomb of Stephen VI.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Damnatio memoriae]]''\n* [[Devil's advocate]]\n* [[List of excommunicable offences in the Catholic Church]]\n* [[List of people excommunicated by the Catholic Church]]\n* [[Posthumous execution]]\n*[[Criticism of the Catholic Church#Excommunication, the interdict, and other penalties|Criticism of the Catholic Church \u00a7 Excommunication, the interdict, and other penalties]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Cummins, Joseph. 2006.

He resumed his bishopric at Porto, where he remained until elected pope on 6 October 891.<ref>D\u00fcmmler, Auxilius und Vulgarius, p. 6 nn. 5 and 6</ref>  Yet this earlier quarrel with John VIII formed the basis of the accusations made at the Cadaver Synod.  According to the tenth-century historian [[Liutprand of Cremona]], Stephen VI asked Formosus' corpse why he \"usurped the universal Roman See in such a spirit of ambition\" after the death of John VIII, echoing John VIII's own assertion that Formosus had tried to seize the papal throne while he was alive.<ref>Liutprand, ''Antapodosis'', I.30, ed. in [[Corpus Christianorum]]: Continuatio Medievalis, vol 156, p. 23, lines 639-43</ref> Two further accusations were also made against Formosus at the Cadaver Synod: that he had committed perjury and that he had attempted to exercise the office of bishop as a layman.<ref>Council of Ravenna in 898, ''acta'' edited by J.D. Mansi,''Sacrorum conciliorum, nova, et amplissima collectio'', vol. 18, col. 221</ref> These are related to the oath Formosus is said to have sworn before the council at Troyes in 878.\n\n==Immediate context==\nThe Cadaver Synod is generally presumed to have been politically motivated. Formosus crowned [[Lambert of Spoleto]] co-ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 892; Lambert's father, [[Guy III of Spoleto]], had earlier been crowned by John VIII.<ref name=\"williams\">Williams, George L. 2004. ''Papal Genealogy: The Families and Descendants of the Popes''. McFarland & Company. {{ISBN|0-7864-2071-5}}. p. 10.</ref>  In 893 Formosus, apparently nervous about Guy's aggression, invited the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] to invade Italy and receive the imperial crown.  Arnulf's invasion failed, and Guy III died shortly afterwards.  Yet Formosus renewed his invitation to Arnulf in 895, and early the next year Arnulf crossed the Alps and entered Rome, where Formosus crowned him as [[Holy Roman Emperor]].  Afterwards the Frankish army departed, and Arnulf and Formosus died within months of each other in 896. Formosus was succeeded by [[Pope Boniface VI]], who himself died two weeks later.  Lambert and his mother, the empress [[Angiltrude]], entered Rome around the time that [[Pope Stephen VI|Stephen VI]] became pope, and the Cadaver Synod was conducted directly afterwards, at the beginning of 897.\n\nThe dominant interpretation of these events until the early twentieth century was straightforward: Formosus had always been a pro-Carolingian, and his crowning of Lambert in 892 was coerced. After the death of Arnulf and the collapse of Carolingian authority in Rome, Lambert entered the city and forced Stephen to convene the Cadaver Synod, both to re-assert his claim to the imperial crown and perhaps also to exact posthumous revenge upon Formosus.<ref>Cf., for example, Duchesne, ''Les premiers temps de l\u2019\u00e9tat pontifical'' (Paris, 1904), p. 301; and the detailed account in the old ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06139b.htm Pope Formosus]</ref>\n\nThis view is now considered obsolete, following the arguments put forth by [[Joseph Duhr]] in 1932.  Duhr pointed out that Lambert was in attendance at the [[Ravenna Council of 898]], convened under [[Pope John IX]].  It was at this proceeding that the decrees of the Cadaver Synod were revoked.  According to the written ''acta'' of the council, Lambert actively approved of the nullification.  If Lambert and Angiltrude had been the architects of Formosus\u2019s degradation, Duhr asked, \u201chow [...] was John IX able to submit to the canons which condemned the odious synod for approbation of the emperor [i.e., Lambert] and his bishops?  How could John IX have dared to broach the matter [...] before the guilty parties, without even making the least allusion to the emperor\u2019s participation?\u201d<ref>Joseph Duhr, \u201cLa concile de Ravenne in 898: la r\u00e9habilitation du pape Formose,\u201d ''Recherches de science religieuse'' 22 (1932), p. 546</ref>  This position has been accepted by another scholar: Girolamo Arnaldi argued that Formosus did not pursue an exclusively pro-Carolingian policy, and that he even had friendly relations with Lambert as late as 895.  Their relations only soured when Lambert's cousin, [[Guy IV of Spoleto]], marched on [[Benevento]] and expelled the Byzantines there.  Formosus panicked at the aggression and sent emissaries into Bavaria seeking Arnulf's help.<ref>Girolamo Arnaldi, \u201cPapa Formoso e gli imperatori della casa di Spoleto,\u201d ''Annali della facolt\u00e0 di lettere e filosofia di Napoli'' 1 (1951), p. 85ff. Portions of this view had been argued earlier by G. Fasoli, ''I re d\u2019Italia'' (Florence, 1949), 32ff</ref>  Arnaldi argues that it was Guy IV, who had entered Rome along with Lambert and his mother [[Angiltrude]] in January 897, who provided the impetus for the synod.<ref>Arnaldi, \"Papa Formoso,\" p. 103</ref>\n\n==The synod==\n[[File:Tafel paepste.jpg|thumb|The list of popes buried in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] includes the recovered body of [[Pope Formosus]]]]\n\nProbably around January 897, Stephen VI ordered that the corpse of his predecessor Formosus be removed from its tomb and brought to the papal court for judgment. With the corpse propped up on a throne, a [[deacon]] was appointed to answer for the deceased pontiff.\n\nFormosus was accused of transmigrating sees in violation of canon law, of perjury, and of serving as a bishop while actually a layman. Eventually, the corpse was found guilty.  Liutprand and other sources say that, after having the corpse stripped of its papal vestments, Stephen then cut off the three fingers of the right hand that it had used in life for blessings, next formally invalidating all of Formosus' acts and ordinations (including his ordination of Stephen VI as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Anagni-Alatri|bishop of Anagni]]). The body was finally interred in a graveyard for foreigners, only to be dug up once again, tied to weights, and cast into the [[Tiber|Tiber River]].\n\nAccording to Liutprand\u2019s version of the story, Stephen VI said: \"When you were bishop of [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Porto-Santa Rufina|Porto]], why did you usurp the universal Roman See in such a spirit of ambition?\u201d<ref>\u201cQuo constituto...formosum e sepulcro extrahere atque in sedem Romani...collocare praecepit. Cui et ait: \u2018Cum Portuensis esses episcopus, cur ambitionis spiritu Romanam universalem usurpasti sedem?\u201d Liutprand, Antapodosis, I.30 (CCCM 156, p. 23, ll. 639-43). Liutprand of Cremona\u2019s is perhaps the most convenient account of synod, though many additional details are furnished by the pro-Formosan Auxilius. Cf. D\u00fcmmler\u2019s edition, Auxilius und Vulgarius (Leipzig, 1866), chs. IV (p. 63ff) and X (p. 70ff) especially.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2008}}\n\nThe macabre spectacle turned public opinion in Rome against Stephen. Rumors circulated that Formosus' body, after washing up on the banks of the [[Tiber River|Tiber]], had begun to perform [[miracle]]s. A public uprising led to Stephen being deposed and imprisoned. While in prison, in July or August 897, he was strangled.\n\nIn December 897, [[Pope Theodore II]] (897) convened a synod that annulled the Cadaver Synod, rehabilitated Formosus, and ordered that his body, which had been recovered from the Tiber, be reburied in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[pontifical vestments]]. In 898, [[Pope John IX|John IX]] (898\u2013900) also nullified the Cadaver Synod, convening two synods (one in Rome, one in [[Ravenna]]) which confirmed the findings of Theodore II's synod, ordered the ''acta'' of the Cadaver Synod to be destroyed, [[List of excommunicated cardinals|excommunicated seven cardinals]] who were involved in the Cadaver Synod, and prohibited any future trial of a dead person.\n\nHowever, [[Pope Sergius III]] (904\u2013911), who as bishop had taken part in the Cadaver Synod as a co-judge, overturned the rulings of Theodore II and John IX, reaffirming Formosus's conviction,<ref>Williams, 2004, p. 11.</ref> and had a laudatory epitaph inscribed on the tomb of Stephen VI.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Damnatio memoriae]]''\n* [[Devil's advocate]]\n* [[List of excommunicable offences in the Catholic Church]]\n* [[List of people excommunicated by the Catholic Church]]\n* [[Posthumous execution]]\n*[[Criticism of the Catholic Church#Excommunication, the interdict, and other penalties|Criticism of the Catholic Church \u00a7 Excommunication, the interdict, and other penalties]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Cummins, Joseph. 2006.

Sagan  proposes two reasons for the persistence of the idea of a [[geocentric]], or Earth-centered universe: human pride in our existence, and the threat of torturing those who dissented from it, particularly during the time of the [[Roman Inquisition]]. However, he also admits that the scientific tools to prove the [[Earth]] orbited the [[Sun]] were (until the last few hundred years) not accurate enough to measure effects such as [[parallax]], making it difficult for astronomers to prove that the geocentric theory was false.\n[[File:PIA23645-Earth-PaleBlueDot-6Bkm-Voyager1-orig19900214-upd20200212.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Pale Blue Dot'' as republished by NASA in 2020 for the images' 30th anniversary.

He begins with an account of the [[Voyager program]], in which Sagan was a participating scientist. He describes the difficulty of working with the low light levels at distant planets, and the mechanical and computer problems which beset the twin spacecraft as they aged, and which could not always be diagnosed and fixed remotely. Sagan then examines each one of the major planets, as well as some of the moons\u2014including [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], and [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]]\u2014focusing on whether life is possible at the frontiers of the Solar System.\n\nSagan argues that studying other [[planet]]s provides context for understanding the Earth\u2014and protecting humanity's only home planet from environmental catastrophe. He believes that [[NASA]]'s decision to cut back exploration of the [[Moon]] after the [[Apollo program]] was a short-sighted decision, despite its expense and declining popularity among the American public. Sagan says future exploration of space should focus on ways to protect Earth and to extend human habitation beyond it. The book was published the same year [[comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] crashed into [[Jupiter]], an event Sagan uses to highlight the danger Earth faces from the occasional [[asteroid]] or [[comet]] large enough to cause substantial damage if it were to hit Earth. He says we need the political will to track large extraterrestrial objects, or we risk losing everything. Sagan argues that in order to save the human race, [[space colonization]] and [[terraforming]] should be utilized.\n\nLater in the book, Sagan's wife, [[Ann Druyan]], challenges readers to pick one of the other planetary dots photographed and featured in the book, and imagine that there are inhabitants on that world who believe that the universe was created solely for themselves. She shared Sagan's belief that humans are not as important [[anthropocentrism|as they think they are]].\n\nThe first edition of the book includes an extensive list of illustrations and photographs, much of it taken from public archives of information released by [[NASA]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|1990s|Astronomy|Books|Spaceflight}}\n* ''[[The Blue Marble]]'', 1972 [[Apollo 17]] photograph\n* [[Wanderers (2014 film)|''Wanderers'' (2014 film)]]\n*[[File:PIA23645-Earth-PaleBlueDot-6Bkm-Voyager1-orig19900214-upd20200212.jpg|thumb]]<br />\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Sagan\n | first = Carl\n | authorlink = Carl Sagan\n | title = Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space\n | url = https://archive.org/details/palebluedotv00saga\n | url-access = registration\n | edition = 1st\n | year = 1994\n | publisher = [[Random House]]\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 0-679-43841-6\n}}\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.thespacereview.com/article/261/1 Sagan's rationale for human spaceflight] Article about Carl Sagan and ''Pale Blue Dot''\n* [https://www.loc.gov/item/cosmos000110/ Short audio recording of Carl Sagan describing the primary concept of his book ''The Pale Blue Dot'' at the United States Library of Congress Seth MacFarlane Collection of the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Archive]\n* [http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap061016.html A new picture of Earth taken through the rings of Saturn] by the ''Cassini'' spacecraft on September 15, 2006.

He also details a human vision for the future.<ref name=\"Biblo\">{{cite web | title = ''Pale Blue Dot'' Media Reviews and Publisher's Notes on biblio.com| url = http://www.biblio.com/isbnsearch.php?isbn=0345376595}}</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\nThe first part of the book examines the claims made throughout history that Earth and the [[human]] species are unique. Sagan  proposes two reasons for the persistence of the idea of a [[geocentric]], or Earth-centered universe: human pride in our existence, and the threat of torturing those who dissented from it, particularly during the time of the [[Roman Inquisition]]. However, he also admits that the scientific tools to prove the [[Earth]] orbited the [[Sun]] were (until the last few hundred years) not accurate enough to measure effects such as [[parallax]], making it difficult for astronomers to prove that the geocentric theory was false.\n[[File:PIA23645-Earth-PaleBlueDot-6Bkm-Voyager1-orig19900214-upd20200212.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Pale Blue Dot'' as republished by NASA in 2020 for the images' 30th anniversary.

He begins with an account of the [[Voyager program]], in which Sagan was a participating scientist. He describes the difficulty of working with the low light levels at distant planets, and the mechanical and computer problems which beset the twin spacecraft as they aged, and which could not always be diagnosed and fixed remotely. Sagan then examines each one of the major planets, as well as some of the moons\u2014including [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], and [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]]\u2014focusing on whether life is possible at the frontiers of the Solar System.\n\nSagan argues that studying other [[planet]]s provides context for understanding the Earth\u2014and protecting humanity's only home planet from environmental catastrophe. He believes that [[NASA]]'s decision to cut back exploration of the [[Moon]] after the [[Apollo program]] was a short-sighted decision, despite its expense and declining popularity among the American public. Sagan says future exploration of space should focus on ways to protect Earth and to extend human habitation beyond it. The book was published the same year [[comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] crashed into [[Jupiter]], an event Sagan uses to highlight the danger Earth faces from the occasional [[asteroid]] or [[comet]] large enough to cause substantial damage if it were to hit Earth. He says we need the political will to track large extraterrestrial objects, or we risk losing everything. Sagan argues that in order to save the human race, [[space colonization]] and [[terraforming]] should be utilized.\n\nLater in the book, Sagan's wife, [[Ann Druyan]], challenges readers to pick one of the other planetary dots photographed and featured in the book, and imagine that there are inhabitants on that world who believe that the universe was created solely for themselves. She shared Sagan's belief that humans are not as important [[anthropocentrism|as they think they are]].\n\nThe first edition of the book includes an extensive list of illustrations and photographs, much of it taken from public archives of information released by [[NASA]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|1990s|Astronomy|Books|Spaceflight}}\n* ''[[The Blue Marble]]'', 1972 [[Apollo 17]] photograph\n* [[Wanderers (2014 film)|''Wanderers'' (2014 film)]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Sagan\n | first = Carl\n | authorlink = Carl Sagan\n | title = Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space\n | url = https://archive.org/details/palebluedotv00saga\n | url-access = registration\n | edition = 1st\n | year = 1994\n | publisher = [[Random House]]\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 0-679-43841-6\n}}\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.thespacereview.com/article/261/1 Sagan's rationale for human spaceflight] Article about Carl Sagan and ''Pale Blue Dot''\n* [https://www.loc.gov/item/cosmos000110/ Short audio recording of Carl Sagan describing the primary concept of his book ''The Pale Blue Dot'' at the United States Library of Congress Seth MacFarlane Collection of the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Archive]\n* [http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap061016.html A new picture of Earth taken through the rings of Saturn] by the ''Cassini'' spacecraft on September 15, 2006.

This is traditionally dated between 1050 BCE and 930 BCE. On the succession of Solomon's son, [[Rehoboam]], around 930 BCE, the biblical account reports that the country split into two kingdoms: the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] (including the cities of [[Shechem]] and [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]]) in the north and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (containing Jerusalem) in the south.\n\nIn contemporary scholarship the united monarchy is generally held to be a literary construction and not a historical reality, pointing to the lack of archaeological evidence. It is generally accepted that a \"[[Davidic line|House of David]]\" existed, but many believe that David could have only been the monarch or [[chieftain]] of Judah, which was likely small, and that the northern kingdom was a separate development.

In identifying these two sources, two separate accounts can be reconstructed. The anti-monarchical source describes [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] as having thoroughly routed the [[Philistines]], yet begrudgingly accepting the people's demand for a ruler, subsequently appointing Saul by [[cleromancy]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe pro-monarchical source describes the divinely appointed birth of [[Saul]] (a single word being changed by a later editor so that it referred to Samuel instead), and his leading of an army to victory over the [[Ammon (nation)|Ammonites]], resulted in the clamouring of the people for him to lead them against the Philistines, whereupon he is appointed king.<ref name=\"jones2001\">{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Gwilym H.|chapter=1 and 2 Samuel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCRYl9Ikk6EC&pg=PA196|editor-last1=Barton|editor-first1=John|editor-link1=John Barton (theologian)|editor-last2=Muddiman|editor-first2=John|editor-link2=John Muddiman|title=The Oxford Bible Commentary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|pages= 197\u2013199|isbn=978-0-19875-500-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Textual critic]]s also point to disparities in the account of David's rise to power as indicative of separate threads being merged later to create a [[Golden Age]] of a united monarchy. David is thought by scholars to have been a ruler in Judah, while Israel, comparatively immense and highly developed, continued unfettered. [[Modern archaeology]] also supports this view.<ref name=Finkelstein2001/>\n\nMost scholars believe the Books of Samuel exhibit too many [[anachronism]]s to have been a contemporary account. For example, there is mention of later [[armor]] (1 Samuel 17:4\u20137, 38\u201339; 25:13), use of [[camel]]s (1 Samuel 30:17), [[cavalry]] (as distinct from [[chariotry]]) (1 Samuel 13:5, 2 Samuel 1:6), and iron picks and axes (as though they were common) (2 Samuel 12:31). The historicity of the conquest described in the Book of Samuel is not attested, and many scholars regard this conquest as legendary in origin, particularly given the lack of evidence for the battles described involving the destruction of the Canaanite peoples. Most scholars believe that Samuel was compiled in the 8th century BCE (rather than the 10th century when most of the events described take place) based on both historical and legendary sources, primarily serving to fill the gap in Israelite history after the events described in [[Deuteronomy]]. This gap in the historical record is characteristic of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]];<ref name=\"AruzSeymour2016\">{{cite book|editor-first1=Joan|editor-last1=Aruz|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last2=Seymour|first=Ann E.|last=Killebrew|title=Assyria to Iberia: Art and Culture in the Iron Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBrfDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA38|date=30 December 2016|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-606-8|pages=30\u201338}}</ref> cultural memories of times before the disaster often became embellished as stories of a \"lost golden age\", as in the Trojan [[Epic Cycle]].<ref name=\"Kalimi2018\">Cf. {{cite book|first=Isaac|last=Kalimi|title=Writing and Rewriting the Story of Solomon in Ancient Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L9Z7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA47|date=29 November 2018|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-58837-9|pages=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\n==Archaeological record==\n\nAccording to [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman|Neil Silberman]], authors of ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]'', ideas of a united monarchy are not accurate history but rather \"creative expressions of a powerful religious reform movement,\" possibly \"based on certain historical kernels.\"<ref name=Finkelstein2001/> Finkelstein and Silberman do accept that David and Solomon were real kings of Judah about the 10th century BCE, but they cite the fact that the earliest independent reference to the Kingdom of Israel dates to about 890 BCE, while that for the kingdom of Judah dates to about 750 BCE.<ref name=\"finkelsteinsilberman2007\">{{cite book |last1=Finkelstein |first1=Israel |last2=Silberman |first2=Neil Asher |title=David and Solomon: In Search of the Bible's Sacred Kings and the Roots of the Western Tradition |date=2007 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-1-416-55688-6 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/David_and_Solomon.html?id=uH7Kg9yEc7AC}}</ref> This is supported by Jonathan Tubb, who argues that the story of the united monarchy was fabricated as a Golden Age tale during the [[Babylonian captivity|Exile]].

This is traditionally dated between 1050 BCE and 930 BCE. On the succession of Solomon's son, [[Rehoboam]], around 930 BCE, the biblical account reports that the country split into two kingdoms: the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] (including the cities of [[Shechem]] and [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]]) in the north and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (containing Jerusalem) in the south.\n\nIn contemporary scholarship the united monarchy is generally held to be a literary construction and not a historical reality, pointing to the lack of archaeological evidence. It is generally accepted that a \"[[Davidic line|House of David]]\" existed, but many believe that David could have only been the monarch or [[chieftain]] of Judah, which was likely small, and that the northern kingdom was a separate development.

For example, there is mention of later [[armor]] (1 Samuel 17:4\u20137, 38\u201339; 25:13), use of [[camel]]s (1 Samuel 30:17), [[cavalry]] (as distinct from [[chariotry]]) (1 Samuel 13:5, 2 Samuel 1:6), and iron picks and axes (as though they were common) (2 Samuel 12:31). The historicity of the conquest described in the Book of Samuel is not attested, and many scholars regard this conquest as legendary in origin, particularly given the lack of evidence for the battles described involving the destruction of the Canaanite peoples. Most scholars believe that Samuel was compiled in the 8th century BCE (rather than the 10th century when most of the events described take place) based on both historical and legendary sources, primarily serving to fill the gap in Israelite history after the events described in [[Deuteronomy]].

Apocalyptica's first two albums consisted mostly of [[cover versions]]; ''Cult'' was their first album to feature mainly original composition, along with using distortion effects much more boldly and frequently, which gave the album a more orchestral sound, and also the album experimented with vocals and other [[instrumentation]]. There are some versions of the first release with \"Path Vol. 2\" as the first track and \"Path\" as the fourteenth. This is the last Apocalyptica album to feature Max Lilja on cello. The song \"Hope Vol.2\" has a music video which features scenes from the film ''[[Vidocq (2001 film)|Vidocq]]''.

Apocalyptica's first two albums consisted mostly of [[cover versions]]; ''Cult'' was their first album to feature mainly original composition, along with using distortion effects much more boldly and frequently, which gave the album a more orchestral sound, and also the album experimented with vocals and other [[instrumentation]]. There are some versions of the first release with \"Path Vol. 2\" as the first track and \"Path\" as the fourteenth. This is the last Apocalyptica album to feature Max Lilja on cello. The song \"Hope Vol.2\" has a music video which features scenes from the film ''[[Vidocq (2001 film)|Vidocq]]''. ''Cult'' along with ''[[Inquisition Symphony (album)|Inquisition Symphony]]'' and ''[[Live (Apocalyptica album)|Live]]'' were all released together in the '''Limited Edition Collectors Box Set'''.<ref>https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Apocalyptica/Collectors_Box_Set/184816</ref> \n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = \n| total_length    = 52:48\n\n| title1          = [[Path Vol. 1 & 2|Path]]\n| note1           = \n| writer1         = \n| length1         = 3:08\n| title2          = Struggle\n| note2           = \n| writer2         = \n| length2         = 3:26\n| title3          = Romance\n| note3           = \n| writer3         = \n| length3         = 3:28\n| title4          = Pray!\n| note4           = \n| writer4         = \n| length4         = 4:22\n| title5          = In Memoriam\n| note5           = \n| writer5         = \n| length5         = 4:41\n| title6          = Hyperventilation\n| note6           = \n| writer6         = \n| length6         = 4:28\n| title7          = Beyond Time\n| note7           = \n| writer7         = \n| length7         = 3:57\n| title8          = Hope\n| note8           = \n| writer8         = \n| length8         = 3:24\n| title9          = Kaamos\n| note9           = \n| writer9         = \n| length9         = 4:42\n| title10         = Coma\n| note10          = [[Live]] at Hollola Church\n| writer10        = \n| length10        = 6:59\n| title11         = [[In the Hall of the Mountain King|Hall of the Mountain King]]\n| note11          = [[Edvard Grieg]] [[Cover version|cover]], from ''[[Peer Gynt (Grieg)|Peer Gynt, Op. 23, Act II, Pt. 5]]''\n| length11        = 3:29\n| title12         = [[Until It Sleeps]]\n| note12          = [[Metallica]] cover, from ''[[Load (album)|Load]]''\n| length12        = 3:15\n| title13         = Fight Fire with Fire\n| note13          = [[Metallica]] cover, from ''[[Ride the Lightning]]''\n| length13        = 3:25\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Special Edition (Disc 2)\n| extra_column    = Note\n| total_length    = 22:42\n| title1          = [[Path Vol. 1 & 2|Path Vol. 2]] \n| extra1          = \n| writer1         = \n| length1         = 3:23\n| title2          = Hope Vol. 2\n| note2           =\n| writer2         = \n| length2         = 4:02\n| title3          = Harmageddon <small>(Live at Muffatwerk, [[M\u00fcnchen]] on October 24, 2000, from ''[[Inquisition Symphony (album)|Inquisition Symphony]]'')</small>\n| note3           = \n| writer3         = \n| length3         = 4:57\n| title4          = [[Nothing Else Matters]] <small>([[Metallica]] cover, from ''[[Metallica (album)|Untitled Metallica album]]'')</small>\n| extra4           = {{ref|nothing else matters|Note 1}}\n| length4         = 5:15\n| title5          = Inquisition Symphony <small>([[Sepultura]] cover, from ''[[Schizophrenia (Sepultura album)|Schizophrenia]]'')</small>\n| extra5           = {{ref|nothing else matters|Note 1}}\n| length5         = 5:05\n}}\n\n===Note===\n#{{note|nothing else matters|Note 1}} Also Live at Muffatwerk, [[M\u00fcnchen]] on October 24, 2000 and are also from ''[[Inquisition Symphony (album)|Inquisition Symphony]]''\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r527803|pure_url=yes}}|title=Cult|publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=January 10, 2012}}</ref>\n| rev2 = [[PiercingMetal]]\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|7|10}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.piercingmetal.com/cd_apocalyptica_cult.htm |title=Reviews \u2013 CD |publisher=PiercingMetal.com |date=November 6, 2001 |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214165435/http://www.piercingmetal.com/cd_apocalyptica_cult.htm |archivedate=February 14, 2012 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n| [[OLiS|Polish Albums Chart]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=7&lang=en |title=Oficjalna lista sprzeda\u017cy :: OLiS \u2013 Official Retail Sales Chart |publisher=OLiS |date=December 18, 2000 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|31\n|}\n\n==Credits==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n\n===Apocalyptica===\n*[[Eicca Toppinen]] \u2013 [[cello]];
