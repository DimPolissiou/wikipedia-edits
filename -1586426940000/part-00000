While ordinary kimono would usually be created by women at home, luxurious silk kimono were designed and created by specialist artists who were usually men.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=24}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection includes some white satin examples patterned with flowers, geometric patterns or emblems such as clouds or waves. These would have been worn as formal dress by samurai women.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}} The military connection is more explicit on a bright red kimono illustrated with {{lang|ja-Latn|gunbai}} [[Japanese war fan|war fans]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}}  Another kind of kimono specific to the military elite is the {{lang|ja-Latn|goshodoki}} or \"palace court style\", which would be worn in the residence of a military leader (a {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Sh\u014dgun|Shogun]]}} or {{lang|ja-Latn|[[daimy\u014d]]}}). These would have landscape scenes, among which there are other motifs usually referencing classic literature. The collection has several examples of this type, often with symbolism referring to stories made popular by [[Noh|Noh plays]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=35\u201344}} Samurai men would dress with a more understated design, exemplified by items in the collection with geometrical designs concentrated around the waist.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=76\u201378}} The {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}}, or sleeping kimono, is a thickly wadded form of wearable bedding. The Khalili Collection has some examples from samurai families: whereas {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}} would normally have simple designs, these are especially elaborate and are made of silk rather than the usual [[cotton]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=93\u201395}}\n\nOther items have rich decoration from the waist down only, and family emblems on the neck and shoulders: a style called {{lang|ja-Latn|tsuma moy\u014d}}. These would be worn by women of the merchant class.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=46\u201351}} The kimono of merchant-class women were more subdued than those of the samurai, but still with bold colours and designs representing nature.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=54}} Red was a popular colour for wealthy women, partly because of its cultural association with youth and passion, and partly because the dye{{snd}}derived from [[safflower]]<ref name=\":3\" />{{snd}}was very expensive, so a bright red garment was an ostentatious display of wealth.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=63}} Indian fabrics, brought to Japan by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] importers, were received with enthusiasm and found many uses. The collection includes a flamboyant under-kimono for a man made by combining these finely patterned fabrics with plain-weave silk and cotton.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=80}} Other items show that Japanese designers started printing designs that were influenced by the Indian patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=80\u201384}} Another example in the collection uses fabric imported from Britain or France: ownership of this exotic textile signified wealth and taste, but it was worn as an undergarment where the design would not be seen.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=87}}\n\nWorn by less wealthy merchants, lower down the social scale, are kimono made of cotton or [[ramie]] and dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]], with less dense designs but still a variety of dyes, patterns and techniques.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=96\u2013102}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX142.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) with a design inspired by the ''[[Eight Views of \u014cmi]]'', 1780\u20131820|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX230.jpg|Underkimono for a man ({{lang|ja-Latn|juban}}) using Indian fabrics, 1800\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX154.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}); landscape scene with bridge, pavilions and thatched huts, 1840\u20131870|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX149.jpg|Summer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|katabira}}) depicting a landscape with fishing nets, 1820\u20131850|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Meiji era (1868\u20131912) ==\nThe Meiji era was a period of modernisation and industrialisation, during which Japan opened itself to the world.{{sfn|Guth|2015|pp=106\u2013107}} It saw a rapid introduction of Western culture to Japan, and also of Japanese culture into Europe and America, where kimono became an object of fascination.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=9}} The production of kimono started to use Western technologies such as [[Dye|synthetic dye]], and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=11}} The textile industry modernised rapidly and silk from Tokyo's factories became Japan's principal export.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}} Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} [[Emperor Meiji|The Emperor]] issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=112}} [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] journeyed to Europe and the United States and the books he wrote about Western clothing and customs were influential.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=113}} So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.{{sfn|Guth|2015|p=110}} In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles. A new type called the {{lang|ja-Latn|[[h\u014dmongi]]}} bridged the gap between formal dress and everyday dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection has items that illustrate the trends of the Meiji era. Several have a plain, bold colour with elaborate design around the hem.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} The technology of the time allowed for subtle [[Color gradient|colour gradients]] rather than abrupt changes of colour. Another trend was for outer and inner garments of the same design.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} One trend in the Meiji era was for women's under-kimono made by combining pieces of different fabric, sometimes of radically different colours and designs. The collection has examples of these.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=137}} For men, the trend was for highly decorative under-kimono that would be covered by outer kimono that were plain or very simply designed. Among the Khalili examples, an undergarment depicts performers and dancers among [[haiku]] poems. Another combines postcard-like scenes of Japan's progress with a textual diary of the Meiji era.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=138\u2013141}}\n\nEven the clothing of infants and young children used bold colours, intricate designs, and materials common to adult fashions. The collection has many examples, including a boy's kimono and under-kimono set, decorated with cranes and pine trees, and a girl's set that combines a deep blue outer garment with a bright red undergarment.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=142\u2013144}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX161.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks in pine trees, 1870-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX158.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) showing flowers on rafts, 1870-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX195.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks, 1880-1900|alt=refer to caption\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono K100.jpg|Outer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) with hanging scroll motifs, 1880\u20131890|alt=refer to caption\n</gallery>\n\n== Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods (1912\u20131950) ==\n\nThe early twentieth century brought a new mix on cultural influences, including greater [[Japanese nationalism|nationalism]] and greater Western influence; especially [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=163\u2013164}} The imagery on kimono{{snd}}particularly boys' kimono{{snd}}reflected this, with depictions of skyscrapers, cars or planes to celebrate the modern world.<ref name=\":3\" /> Kimono of these periods are distinguished by vibrant colours and an enormous variety of designs.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=160}} Mass-produced garments used [[Textile printing|printing]] to cheaply imitate traditional dyeing processes.<ref name=\"Atkins\" /> A type of inexpensive, durable, printed silk kimono known as {{lang|ja-Latn|meisen}} became very popular.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} Urban culture of the Taish\u014d period was marked by {{lang|ja-Latn|modanizumu}} (modernism) which celebrated Western art movements and fashion.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} In many aspects of Japanese culture, there was a tension between traditional, orthodox, Japanese influences and modern, Western, subversive influences. The bold new kimono designs were a middle ground that combined aspects from both.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=162}} With the rise of [[Japanese militarism]] in the 1930s, male kimono designs adopted explicitly militaristic imagery, including soldiers, [[bomber]]s and tanks.<ref name=\"Atkins\">{{cite journal|last1=Atkins|first1=Jacqueline M.|title=Omoshirogara Textile Design and Children's Clothing in Japan 1910\u20131930|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings.

These inhabit a spectrum from geometric block patterns to floral patterns, with some having floral motifs repeating within a striped or other pattern. These repeating patterns were achieved with stencil printing or by selective dyeing.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=180\u2013201}} As well as stripes and checks, the geometrical patterns used include [[arabesque]]s and [[swastika]]s. One fashion trend of the 1930s, represented in the collection, was for black kimono with abstract patterns in red, yellow, cream and white.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=251\u2013252}}\n\nThe semi-formal, colourfully-decorated {{lang|ja-Latn|h\u014dmongi}} style is represented in the collection,{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=170\u2013171}} as is a formal, black style with decoration limited to below the waist.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=173}} The collection also has examples of modernist kimono whose decoration celebrates modern forms of transport including [[ocean liners]].

While ordinary kimono would usually be created by women at home, luxurious silk kimono were designed and created by specialist artists who were usually men.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=24}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection includes some white satin examples patterned with flowers, geometric patterns or emblems such as clouds or waves. These would have been worn as formal dress by samurai women.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}} The military connection is more explicit on a bright red kimono illustrated with {{lang|ja-Latn|gunbai}} [[Japanese war fan|war fans]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=29\u201330}}  Another kind of kimono specific to the military elite is the {{lang|ja-Latn|goshodoki}} or \"palace court style\", which would be worn in the residence of a military leader (a {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Sh\u014dgun|Shogun]]}} or {{lang|ja-Latn|[[daimy\u014d]]}}). These would have landscape scenes, among which there are other motifs usually referencing classic literature. The collection has several examples of this type, often with symbolism referring to stories made popular by [[Noh|Noh plays]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=35\u201344}} Samurai men would dress with a more understated design, exemplified by items in the collection with geometrical designs concentrated around the waist.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=76\u201378}} The {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}}, or sleeping kimono, is a thickly wadded form of wearable bedding. The Khalili Collection has some examples from samurai families: whereas {{lang|ja-Latn|yogi}} would normally have simple designs, these are especially elaborate and are made of silk rather than the usual [[cotton]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=93\u201395}}\n\nOther items have rich decoration from the waist down only, and family emblems on the neck and shoulders: a style called {{lang|ja-Latn|tsuma moy\u014d}}. These would be worn by women of the merchant class.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=46\u201351}} The kimono of merchant-class women were more subdued than those of the samurai, but still with bold colours and designs representing nature.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=54}} Red was a popular colour for wealthy women, partly because of its cultural association with youth and passion, and partly because the dye{{snd}}derived from [[safflower]]<ref name=\":3\" />{{snd}}was very expensive, so a bright red garment was an ostentatious display of wealth.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=63}} Indian fabrics, brought to Japan by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] importers, were received with enthusiasm and found many uses. The collection includes a flamboyant under-kimono for a man made by combining these finely patterned fabrics with plain-weave silk and cotton.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=80}} Other items show that Japanese designers started printing designs that were influenced by the Indian patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=80\u201384}} Another example in the collection uses fabric imported from Britain or France: ownership of this exotic textile signified wealth and taste, but it was worn as an undergarment where the design would not be seen.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|p=87}}\n\nWorn by less wealthy merchants, lower down the social scale, are kimono made of cotton or [[ramie]] and dyed with [[indigo dye|indigo]], with less dense designs but still a variety of dyes, patterns and techniques.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Edo period\"|2015|pp=96\u2013102}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX142.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) with a design inspired by the ''[[Eight Views of \u014cmi]]'', 1780\u20131820\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX230.jpg|Underkimono for a man ({{lang|ja-Latn|juban}}) using Indian fabrics, 1800\u20131850\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX154.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}); landscape scene with bridge, pavilions and thatched huts, 1840\u20131870\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX149.jpg|Summer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|katabira}}) depicting a landscape with fishing nets, 1820\u20131850\n</gallery>\n\n== Meiji era (1868\u20131912) ==\nThe Meiji era was a period of modernisation and industrialisation, during which Japan opened itself to the world.{{sfn|Guth|2015|pp=106\u2013107}} It saw a rapid introduction of Western culture to Japan, and also of Japanese culture into Europe and America, where kimono became an object of fascination.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=9}} The production of kimono started to use Western technologies such as [[Dye|synthetic dye]], and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=11}} The textile industry modernised rapidly and silk from Tokyo's factories became Japan's principal export.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}} Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=118}} [[Emperor Meiji|The Emperor]] issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=112}} [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]] journeyed to Europe and the United States and the books he wrote about Western clothing and customs were influential.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=113}} So Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women.{{sfn|Guth|2015|p=110}} In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles. A new type called the {{lang|ja-Latn|[[h\u014dmongi]]}} bridged the gap between formal dress and everyday dress.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=117}}\n\nThe Khalili Collection has items that illustrate the trends of the Meiji era. Several have a plain, bold colour with elaborate design around the hem.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} The technology of the time allowed for subtle [[Color gradient|colour gradients]] rather than abrupt changes of colour. Another trend was for outer and inner garments of the same design.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=126\u2013134}} One trend in the Meiji era was for women's under-kimono made by combining pieces of different fabric, sometimes of radically different colours and designs. The collection has examples of these.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|p=137}} For men, the trend was for highly decorative under-kimono that would be covered by outer kimono that were plain or very simply designed. Among the Khalili examples, an undergarment depicts performers and dancers among [[haiku]] poems. Another combines postcard-like scenes of Japan's progress with a textual diary of the Meiji era.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=138\u2013141}}\n\nEven the clothing of infants and young children used bold colours, intricate designs, and materials common to adult fashions. The collection has many examples, including a boy's kimono and under-kimono set, decorated with cranes and pine trees, and a girl's set that combines a deep blue outer garment with a bright red undergarment.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Meiji period\"|2015|pp=142\u2013144}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX161.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks in pine trees, 1870-1900\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX158.jpg|Kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|kosode}}) showing flowers on rafts, 1870-1900\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono KX195.jpg|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) depicting hawks, 1880-1900\nFile:Khalili Collection of Kimono K100.jpg|Outer kimono for a woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|uchikake}}) with hanging scroll motifs, 1880\u20131890\n</gallery>\n\n== Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods (1912\u20131950) ==\n\nThe early twentieth century brought a new mix on cultural influences, including greater [[Japanese nationalism|nationalism]] and greater Western influence; especially [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=163\u2013164}} The imagery on kimono{{snd}}particularly boys' kimono{{snd}}reflected this, with depictions of skyscrapers, cars or planes to celebrate the modern world.<ref name=\":3\" /> Kimono of these periods are distinguished by vibrant colours and an enormous variety of designs.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=160}} Mass-produced garments used [[Textile printing|printing]] to cheaply imitate traditional dyeing processes.<ref name=\"Atkins\" /> A type of inexpensive, durable, printed silk kimono known as {{lang|ja-Latn|meisen}} became very popular.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} Urban culture of the Taish\u014d period was marked by {{lang|ja-Latn|modanizumu}} (modernism) which celebrated Western art movements and fashion.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=161}} In many aspects of Japanese culture, there was a tension between traditional, orthodox, Japanese influences and modern, Western, subversive influences. The bold new kimono designs were a middle ground that combined aspects from both.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=162}} With the rise of [[Japanese militarism]] in the 1930s, male kimono designs adopted explicitly militaristic imagery, including soldiers, [[bomber]]s and tanks.<ref name=\"Atkins\">{{cite journal|last1=Atkins|first1=Jacqueline M.|title=Omoshirogara Textile Design and Children's Clothing in Japan 1910\u20131930|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings.

These inhabit a spectrum from geometric block patterns to floral patterns, with some having floral motifs repeating within a striped or other pattern. These repeating patterns were achieved with stencil printing or by selective dyeing.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=180\u2013201}} As well as stripes and checks, the geometrical patterns used include [[arabesque]]s and [[swastika]]s. One fashion trend of the 1930s, represented in the collection, was for black kimono with abstract patterns in red, yellow, cream and white.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=251\u2013252}}\n\nThe semi-formal, colourfully-decorated {{lang|ja-Latn|h\u014dmongi}} style is represented in the collection,{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|pp=170\u2013171}} as is a formal, black style with decoration limited to below the waist.{{sfn|Jackson, \"Dress in the Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods\"|2015|p=173}} The collection also has examples of modernist kimono whose decoration celebrates modern forms of transport including [[ocean liners]].

In the second half, United scored four times in the first twenty minutes; Cole scored his third and fourth, while Hughes also scored two. [[Paul Ince]] scored United's eighth with a [[Free kick (association football)|free kick]] into an empty net while Ipswich's goalkeeper [[Craig Forrest]] was arguing with the referee, before Cole scored a Premier League-record fifth goal, United's ninth, in the 89th minute.

Since its inception in 2012, FSR has embarked upon various endeavours to benefit the masses through many events, known for their creative names. Due to the efforts of a group of hardworking and inspired students, FSR has managed to go beyond the college boundaries to various orphanages, schools, and cities. The flagship initiatives of FSR are:\n\n=== Gold Dustbin ===\n[[File:Fsr at synthika trust.JPG|right|thumb|The FSR team at Synthika Trust]] The Gold Dustbin event, usually held at the end of the academic year, is the first event in the FSR calendar. Student volunteers collect items from hostels on campus, and after thorough segregation, these items are sold. The money acquired by selling these items is used to organize the \u2018Gift a Birthday\u2019 event at the Synthika Trust in [[Lalgudi]], [[Trichy]]. In 2015, the money generated from this event was used to set up a library in the REC Middle School in an event called 'Pages'.\n\n=== Pages === \nPages was social responsibility outreach conducted by Festember in Chettinad Vidyashram School on 2 September 2016 in association with the NGO [[Teach for India]] and popular children's magazine [[Tinkle]]. Pages is primarily a book collection drive where school students, teachers contribute books which would go as proceeds to [[Teach for India]] to educate children in rural India. The event was launched with sub-editor of Tinkle, Sean D'Mello, as the chief guest who later conducted a small workshop with the school students focusing on story writing.\n\n=== Young Astronomer Talent Search (YATS) ===\nA small step towards this was the Young Astronomers Talent Search organized by Festember Social Responsibility at St Johns Vestry Anglo Indian High School in association with [[Tata Steel]] and Space Kids.  A diversity of events such as model exhibits, essay writing, word games, role play and debate were conducted. Students set up astronomy models, centered on the work done by [[ISRO]] for the exhibits.

Festember also joined the No Shave November moment where volunteers were asked to give up shaving for a month and donate the amount typically spent for that purpose. The amount collected was a big sum of Rs 20,000 and it was collected from over 1000 participants. The money collected was donated to the Indian Prostate Cancer Foundation, an organisation dedicated to raising awareness of Prostate cancer in men. The money was then used to conduct a screening session for Armed Force veterans.\n\n=== Paperback ===\nThe paperback initiative of FSR which aims at reducing paper wastage. This event involved students actively volunteering to give their unused exam answer sheets which would otherwise go waste. The collected sheets were reused in various Festember events. Also, the team didn\u2019t restrict themselves to the fest and took a step forward to serve the society. Booklets were made from the remaining sheets and distributed to Illuminate, a government certified charitable trust that aims at developing the lives of the children of the marginalized communities. This Paperback initiative is unique and a true realization of FSR\u2019s goal to create ripples of change throughout the year and for the years to come.\n\n=== Peace Rally ===\n\"Walk For Peace\" event conceived with the idea of taking the message \"Individual peace contributes to world peace\" was organized by Heartfulness Meditation Organization (USA).

In true ''therukoothu'' style, the team brought out the importance of physical activity for children of the current generation, complete with meaningful songs, relatable characters, and humorous wordplay.\n\n=== Metrole ===\n[[File:Fsr team metrole.JPG|right|thumb|The FSR team during the Metrole rally in [[Trichy]]]]In 2013, in an attempt to increase awareness about social issues in the area of a large audience, the FSR team headed to Trichy and commenced Metrole.

The second edition of Aashi invited volunteers to spend a morning with the strong-willed women at the rehabilitation centre for blind women, Mannapuram, Trichy. The drive succeeded in instilling the courage to face challenges in all the participants.\n\n=== CCC ===\nChannelled Clarity towards Charity (CCC) is an inter-school event conducted each year at various schools in different cities by the Festember Social Responsibility Team. In 2017 the event was held at SBOA, Chennai and in 2018 it was hosted by the Akara World School. The competitions range from literary events to poster making and many more.
