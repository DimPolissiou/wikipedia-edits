These schools became cultural and academic centers as many people traveled from all over the globe for knowledge and instruction. Well before contact with external cultures, Africans had developed pools of understanding and educational pools.\n\n=== Overview of Education in Colonial Africa ===\nThe onset of the colonial period in the 19th century marked the beginning of the end for traditional African education.  European forces, [[missionaries]], and colonists all came ready and willing to change existing traditions to meet their own needs and ambitions. Colonial powers such as Spain, Portugal, Belgium and France colonized the continent without putting in a system of education. Because the primary focus of colonization was reaping benefits from commercial colonial economies, cash crop production, extraction of raw materials, other physically laborious tasks were prioritized. These economies did not expand to require jobs of a higher skill set or more labor, therefore intensive labor that required little skill was high in demand. Because of such circumstances there was little demand to educate or train the colonized populations. Furthermore, colonial powers were unwilling to offer education to those they colonized unless it benefited them. Either colonial powers did not view investing in African education as a practical use of their revenue or they refrained from educating Africans in order to avoid any uprisings. Those in positions of authority were in fear of access to widespread access to higher education specifically. Colonial powers often found themselves in a debate whether or not to educate their colonized populations and if so, to what extent. Specifically, the British Education Committee of the Privy Council advocated for vocational education and training rather than one focused on academia. This vocational training however neglected professions such as engineering, technology, or similar subjects. Instead the vocational training had a dominant racial overtone which stressed African training for skills fitting with their assumed social and mental inadequacy. Notably, the Belgians under King Leopold prohibited access to higher education in their colonies whereas other colonial powers put in barriers in infrastructure or access such as limiting language of instruction to the language of the colonizer, limits on teaching curriculums, and ensuring the curriculum did not reflect any Afro-ethnicity. By demanding that communities create physical schools with strict [[curriculum]], the foreign powers were able to dictate what the people learned, adjusting it to further their agenda.  This not only forced new form and content to education, but abandoned the knowledge gained from the largely informal education.  With less community awarenaess, efficiency in learning skills, and especially understanding of the past, African communities began to dwindle in education and prosperity. Aspects of colonialism are still prevalent in African countries that struggled to escape effects of colonization today.\n\nBetween the 1950s and 1990s, African countries finally regained their independence.  With this recovered freedom, they began to rebuild their traditional forms of education.  What had inevitably evolved, however, was a hybrid of the two models. With the collaboration of donor agencies and Western demand, pushes for development of African education and the building of human capital dominated global conversation. Namely, the 1960s were known as the First Development Decade by the UN. Policymakers prioritized secondary and tertiary education before also setting their sights for universal primary education around 1980. This set the precedent for educational planning. Although children and adults may learn from their families and community, a sense of individuality has also developed that today both drives ingenuity and creates separation between groups and cultural tradition.  African education programs have developed that involve both groups; an [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] awareness program, for example, may involve members coming into communities and sharing their knowledge.  Although this is a direct, cognitive approach, they also try to involve all members of the community, allowing for the creation of ownership and cultural acceptance.\n\n=== French Colonial Africa ===\nThe use of education as a tool of colonization was widespread throughout the [[French colonial empire|French Colonial Empire]]. [[Hubert Lyautey]], the first Resident-General of [[French protectorate in Morocco|French Morocco]], advocated for the facilitation of ruling and conquest through cooperation with native elites. To facilitate the relationship with this \"bourgeois\u201d class of francophone Africans, selective educational institutions were established across the French Empire.\n\nThe teaching of the French language in Moroccan institutions of higher education, such as the University of Fez, was intended to \u201cpromote economic development and political compliance without assimilating or deracinating the students or preparing them for political agency\u201d.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Segalla|first=Spencer D.|date=2003-05-09|title=Georges Hardy and Educational Ethnology in French Morocco, 1920-26|journal=French Colonial History|volume=4|issue=1|pages=171\u2013190|doi=10.1353/fch.2003.0026|issn=1543-7787}}</ref> This system allowed colonial authorities to educate a class of native Moroccans that could carry out administrative roles and functions. In his book, ''French Colonial Education and the Making of the Francophone African Bourgeoisie,'' Program Chair of Africana Studies at [[Washington and Lee University]], Mohamed Kamara writes'','' \u201cFor the kind of society the colonialist had in mind, he must create and nurture an elite that will assist for as long as possible in the administration and exploitation of its vast overseas territories\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kamara|first=Mohamed|date=2005|title=French Colonial Education and the Making of the Francophone African Bourgeoisie|journal=Dalhousie French Studies|volume=72|pages=105\u2013114|issn=0711-8813|jstor=40837624}}</ref>\n\nIn classrooms, students were given a predetermined curriculum. The basic goal of this classroom practice was to provide only a limited selection of information for students, leaving very little margin for questioning or critical thinking. Only a limited number of families were permitted to send their children to school, which fit with the underlying goal of creating an exclusive class of native-born Moroccans, who would serve as a sort of liaison between white colonial officials and the masses.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== British Colonial Africa ===\nEducation in [[British Empire#Britain's imperial century (1815\u20131914)|British Colonial Africa]] can be characterized by three primary phases. The first of these is from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], then the [[Interwar period|Interwar Period]], and finally, the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]] until [[African independence movements|independence]].\n\nFrom the late 19th-Century until the First World War, British colonial education in Africa was largely carried out by missionaries at mission schools. Although these schools were founded with religious intent, they played a significant role in the early colonial machine. Much like in French Colonial Africa, British colonists sought out English-speaking natives who could serve as \u2018liaisons\u201d between them and the native population, however, this was done far more out of an economic incentive than a political one.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Windel|first=Aaron|date=2009|title=British Colonial Education in Africa: Policy and Practice in the Era of Trusteeship|journal=History Compass|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1\u201321|doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2008.00560.x|issn=1478-0542}}</ref> As the demand for English-speaking Africans increased, mission schools provided training in the form of teaching of the Bible. As time went on, however, British industrialists began to complain about the lack of skilled labor, and as such, the British Government supplied mission schools with grants for the vocational training of Africans in various trades critical to British industrial efforts.\n\nBritish colonial education in Africa during Interwar Period can be characterized by a push for uniformity, despite colonial authorities demonstrating their acute awareness of the notable differences between the different regions of the Empire. Critical to this, as well, was the universal recognition of nationality as a basic human right under the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]]. Colonies were, as outlined by the League of Nations, to be eventually granted independence, with the European powers entrusted as the stewards of \u201ccivilization\u201d for their respective colonies. Colonies were only to be allowed independence once they could demonstrate their capacity for self-rule.\u00a0In former Governor General of Nigeria (1914-1919), [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Lord Lugard's]], 1922 book, ''The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa'' writes,\n\n\u201c...do not enter the tropics on sufferance, or employ their technical skill, their energy, and their capital as \u2018interlopers\u2019 or as \u2018greedy capitalists\u2019, but in the fulfillment of the Mandate of civilization\u201d.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn accordance with this, in 1923 the British Government established the Advisory Committee on Education in British Tropical Africa (with the word \u2018tropical\u2019 removed to broaden its jurisdiction). With its establishment, for the first time, the colonial authority would be uniformly administering its educational goals across all British African colonies. Programs begun under the new committee were aimed at increasing the \u201cself-sufficiency\u201d of village economies and providing community incentives to counteract flight into big cities. Educational practices under the CEBA came to be known as \u2018adapted\u2019, as it was sought to adjust western education to the contemporary European understanding of the \u2018African Mind\u2019 as inherently different -\u00a0 which is to say, education was often administered through local contexts and practices, all the while teaching western curriculum. In his essay ''British Colonial Education in Africa: Policy and Practice in the Era of Trusteeship'', Aaron Windel of Bowdoin College describes this,\n\n\u201cTypical lessons in a village school operating on adapted principles focused on hygiene, vernacular word building, drill,and basic local geography. Ideally, lessons would be taught on the principle of \u2018teach by doing\u2019 and would include objects\u00a0 from village life. One geography lesson used a bicycle pump, a pail of water, and a small gourd to simulate a ship carrying sugar from India and caught in a monsoon. Adapted pedagogy could also include dramatizations of \u2018African tribal histories\u2019 or special holiday plays with an African focus\".<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost British officials (including Lord Lugard) believed that trusteeship would continue for many generations to come, and the goals of \u2018civilizing\u2019 the native population began to take precedence. Treatment of colonial subjects continued to vary wildly as determined by race, and white settlers were continuously given preferential treatment in the distribution of land, job opportunities, etc.\n\nAs British-administered schools were taking shape during the Interwar Period, a number of independent schools focusing on literacy and offering alternative curricula began to emerge. Such schools were thought of as a threat to the colonial system and colonial governments were worried that these so-called \u2018outlaw\u2019 schools would instill subversiveness and anti-colonial thought in the native populations. One such independent school was formed in [[Kenya]] among the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], and made English as its language of instruction, with the ultimate goal of enabling the Kikuyu to fight for land property rights in colonial legal and administrative bodies. Over time, as anti-colonial sentiment gained momentum, independent schools were increasingly viewed by the colonial government as breeding grounds for freedom fighters and independence advocates, which culminated in their banning in 1952 as part of the [[Mau Mau Emergency]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Education in Postcolonial Africa ==\nIn 2012, the [[United Nations]] adopted the [[Millennium Development Goals]], a set of development goals for the year 2015, more specifically, \u201cto ensure that by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike will be able to complete a full course of [[Primary education|primary schooling]].\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG_FS_2_EN.pdf|title=Millennium Development Goals Goal 2 Fact Sheet|last=|first=|date=September 2010|website=un.org|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref> That same year, the [[World Education Forum]] met in [[Dakar|Dakar, Senegal]], and adopted the Dakar Framework for Action reaffirming the commitment to achieving Education for All by the year 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-all/|title=Education for All {{!}} Education {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, according to [[UNESCO]], only 57% of African children were enrolled in primary schools, the lowest enrollment rate of any region surveyed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001572/157229e.pdf|title=Regional overview: sub-Saharan Africa|last=|first=|date=2008|website=unesco.org|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref> The report also showed marked gender inequalities: in almost all countries enrollment of boys far outpaced that of girls. However, in some countries, education is relatively strong. In Zimbabwe, literacy has reached 92%.<ref>{{cite web |title=SA can learn a thing or two from Zimbabwe's education system |url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/ideas/2017-11-30-sa-can-learn-a-thing-or-two-from-zimbabwes-education-system/}}</ref>\n\nSteps such as the abolition of school fees, investments in teaching infrastructure and resources, and school meals from the [[World Food Programme]] helped drive enrollment up by millions. Yet despite the significant progress of many countries, the world fell short of meeting its goal of [[Universal Primary Education]] (UPE). In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2013, only about 79% of primary school-age children were enrolled in school.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Table-Admin-Data-updated-Oct.-2015-includes-8-tabs_77.xlsx,%20http://data.unicef.org/topic/education/overview/|title=Overview - UNICEF DATA|work=UNICEF DATA|access-date=2017-03-16}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> 59 million children of primary-school age were out of school,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:.

Disparity between genders is partially due to females being excluded from school for being pregnant.<ref>{{cite web |title=Africa: Make Girls' Access to Education a Reality |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/16/africa-make-girls-access-education-reality |website=Human Rights Watch |date=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the expiration of the MDGs in 2015, the UN adopted a set of [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for the year 2030. The fourth goal addressed education, with the stated aim to \u201censure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> The World Education Forum also convened in [[Incheon]], [[South Korea|Korea]] to discuss the implementation of this goal, and adopted the Incheon Declaration for Education 2030. It remains to be seen what effect the late12st measures have on the state of education participation in African countries.\n\nRegarding issues of quality in education and equity, there are underlying causes that deter progress such as high drop-out rates, grade repetition, poor quality of education and educational resources, teacher shortages, poor infrastructure and supplies, access to education for rural and remote areas, and stigmas for marginalized groups.\n\n===Language===\n\nDue to high linguistic diversity, the legacy of colonialism and the need for knowledge of international languages such as English and French in employment and higher education, most schooling in Africa takes places in languages that teachers and pupils do not speak natively, and in some cases simply do not understand. There is considerable evidence that pupils schooled in a second language achieve poorer results than those schooled in their mother tongue, as lack of proficiency in the second language impairs understanding and encourages ineffective rote learning.<ref>Walter, S. L. (2015). Mother Tongue-based Education in Developing Countries: Some emerging insights. Researchgate.net.</ref><ref>Dutcher, N. in collaboration with Tucker, G. R. (1997). The Use of First and Second Languages in Education: A Review of Educational Experience, Washington D.C., World Bank, Country Department III.</ref> Although UNESCO have recommended since the 1950s that children be taught early literacy in their mother tongue, progressing later to other languages, not all African countries implement this effectively. Even where the earliest grades are taught in the mother tongue, pupils are typically forced to switch to languages such as English and French before acquiring proficiency in these languages.<ref>Mehrotra, S. (1998). Education for All: Policy Lessons From High-Achieving Countries. UNICEF Staff Working Papers, New York, Unicef.</ref>\n\n===Lack of proper facilities and educators===\n\nAnother reason for the low education rates in Africa is the lack of proper schooling facilities and unequal opportunity for education across countries.  Many schools across Africa find it hard to employ teachers due to the low pay and lack of suitable people. This is particularly true for schools in remote areas. Most people who manage to receive education would prefer to move to big cities or even overseas where more opportunities and higher pay await. Thus, there will be an overly large class sizes and high average number of students per teacher in a school. Moreover, the teachers are usually those unqualified with few teaching aids and/or textbook provision. Due to this, children attending schools in rural areas usually attain poorer results in standardised tests compared to their urban counterparts. This can be seen in the reports given by the Northern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ).<ref>{{cite web|last=SACMEQ III|title=SACMEQ III Project Results: Pupil achievement levels in reading and mathematics Working Document Number 1|url=http://www.sacmeq.org/downloads/sacmeqIII/WD01_SACMEQ_III_Results_Pupil_Achievement.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727230449/http://www.sacmeq.org/downloads/sacmeqIII/WD01_SACMEQ_III_Results_Pupil_Achievement.pdf|archivedate=27 July 2011}}</ref> Those taking the tests in rural areas score much lower than those in small towns and big cities. This shows a lack of equal education opportunity given to children from different parts of the same country.\n\nWith teachers being less qualified than others in urban areas the teaching to learning environment takes an effect amongst the students. In one instance teachers took the same test as their students and three fourths of them had failed.<ref>\"End It, Don't Mend It - Our Falling Education Standards.\" Africa News Service 15 Dec. 2011. Opposing Viewpoints In Context. Web. 19 July. 2013</ref> In addition, those that do not receive the same education to those in the bigger cities have trouble even after graduation with reading, writing, and doing math.<ref>\"Sub-Saharan Africa Strengthens Advocacy for Quality Education.\" Africa News Service 10 June 2011. Opposing Viewpoints In Context. Web. 19 July. 2013.</ref> Students who do not attain the same equal education to those in urban environments do not achieve the same outcome in establishing success with a career. With education being a major concern towards achieving a career and establishing a future, Africa needs to be aware that equal education needs to be established within all schools throughout the countries.\n\n===Emigration===\n\nNext, [[emigration]] leads to a loss of highly educated people and financial loss. The loss of skilled people can only be replaced with another huge cost which imply the loss of money spent educating people who leave and new people to replace them. Even though an almost 5.5% of [[GDP]] investment in education,<ref>{{cite web|title=South Africa: fast facts|url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/facts.htm#education|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719213531/http://www.southafrica.info/about/facts.htm#education|archivedate=2008-07-19}}</ref> the loss makes it difficult for the government to budget another amount in education as they will need to prioritize other needs such as military budget and debt servicing.<ref>{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Kevin|title=Basic education for all Africans|url=https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/subjindx/134edu.htm|accessdate=11 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Culture ===\nWestern models and standards still continue to dominate African education. Because of colonization African institutions, particularly universities, still instruct using Euro-centric curriculums with almost no connection to life in Africa. This is further perpetuated by the use of European and American imported textbooks. Many view this lack of self sufficiency as an ongoing effect of colonization upheld by the modern, corrupt African elite. This attitude rests on the basis that during colonization the African ruling elite exploited their own people for their own benefit rather than advocate for the interests of their own people.\n\n=== Global water crisis ===\nThe global water crisis has severe effects on education in rural countries in Africa. Limited access to education and health issues can be further compounded by inadequate water systems or disease that may follow. Malaria, cited to be a main cause of death in Africa, is a mosquito-borne disease that can commonly be found in unmanaged pools of still water. The mosquitos breed in such pools and consequently children who drink from these pools can die or fall severely ill. Furthermore, such an intense illness can later affect the cognitive abilities of children who fall ill at a young age. This is not only applicable biologically but also as an effect of falling ill: children who miss a significant amount of school are unable to optimize their education due to missing lessons.\n\n===Military and conflict===\n\nMilitary spending is causing education spending to decrease immensely. According to a March 2011 report by [[UNESCO]], [[armed conflict]] is the biggest threat to education in Africa. While the number of dropouts across the continent has been increasing dramatically, one of the influences of war and conflict on education is the diversion of public funds from education to military spending. An already underfunded system is losing more money. Twenty-one African countries have been identified as the highest spenders of gross domestic product on military globally compared with the amount directed toward education. Military and conflict also leads to the displacement of children. It often forces them to remain in camps or flee to their neighboring countries where education is not available the world is going to explode to them.<ref name=\"War Hurting Learning in Continent\">{{cite web|title=War Hurting Learning in Continent|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/|accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Influential initiatives ==\nInitiatives to improve education in Africa include:\n\n===Intracontinental===\n\n*[[NEPAD]]'s [[NEPAD E-School programme|E-school programme]] is an ambitious plan to provide internet and computer facilities to all schools on the continent.\n*[http://www.sacmeq.org SACMEQ] is a consortium of 15 Ministries of Education in Southern and Eastern Africa which undertakes integrated research and training activities to monitor and evaluate the quality of basic education, and generates information that can be used by decision-makers to plan and improve the quality of education.\n* For 10 years, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110812083525/http://benineducationfund.org/blog/ Benin Education Fund (BEF)] has provided scholarships and education support to students from the Atakora province in northeastern Benin.

This was most often found to be because parents and communities feel as though they lack any kind of power in regard to their child's education. In [[Uganda]] only 50% of parents believe that they have the power to influence decisions regarding the education of their child. In [[Morocco]], just 20% of parents believed they held any sort of power.<ref name=\"image.guardian.co.uk\" />\n\nThe unavailability and incompleteness of records in schools and districts prevents the documentation and prevention of corrupt practices. The African Education Watch conducted surveys all over the continent and identified the three most common practices of corruption:\n\n*'''Illegal collection of fees:''' One part of their research focused on so-called registration fees. Parents from every country surveyed reported paying even though, by law, primary schooling is free. The report found that the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9% in [[Ghana]], to 90% in [[Morocco]]. An average of 44% of parents still report paying skill fees in the study. The average fee cost $4.16, a major expense for families in countries like [[Madagascar]], [[Niger]] and [[Sierra Leone]].<ref name=\"image.guardian.co.uk\" />\n*'''Embezzlement of school funds:''' In the study, [[Transparency International]] found that 64% of the schools surveyed on the continent published no financial information at all.<ref name=\"image.guardian.co.uk\" />\n*'''Power abuse:''' Another major problem is incompetent management. The report found that in many schools the little resources they did have were being wasted or lost. Overall, 85% of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all. In Morocco, just 23% of head teachers received training in financial management, despite being responsible for budgets. The TI report found that there was sexual abuse in schools from teachers. The TI report also found that many schools were plagued by teacher absenteeism and alcoholism.<ref name=\"image.guardian.co.uk\" />\n\nWithout this basic education, the report found it was nearly impossible to go on to high school or college. African children are missing this link that allows them to have a chance in trade or to go beyond their villages.\n<ref name=\"dw-world.de\">{{cite web|title=Corruption Stifles Learning in Africa, Report Finds|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5277312,00.html |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== NGO involvement ==\n\nA report by [[USAID]] and the Bureau for Africa, Office of Sustainable Development, found that NGOs are increasingly participating in contribute to the delivery of education services, education policy decisions and are included by donors and government officials in many parts of the education system. Of course, this varies country to country and region to region.\n\nNGOs working in education in Africa often encountered tension and competition when working. Schools, parents and, most often government officials, feel threatened by third-party involvement and feel that they are \"crashing the party.\" The report continues that for NGOs to be effective, they must understand that they do not have the same perspective as government officials as to who is in control. If they do not recognize the government of the country they are working in, they will compromise their objectives.<ref name=\"pdf.usaid.gov\">{{cite web|title=Evolving Partnerships: The Role of NGOs in Basic Education in Africa|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACQ444.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe report goes into more detail about [[NGO]] relations with governments in education. The relationship is viewed from completely separate points. African governments see NGOs and their work as \"an affair of government\" or, in other words, working as a part and in collaboration with the country's government. NGOs on the other hand view themselves as very separate entities in African education. They see themselves fulfilling [[moral responsibility]]. They believe that they are identifying needs or areas of development in situations under which the government has ultimately been unaccountable and separately mobilizing resources toward those needs or development areas. Government and NGOs are hold contrasting beliefs about each other's abilities. Governments often think NGOs are unqualified to make important policy decision and that they could undermine their legitimacy if seen as superior. In some cases, NGOs have found government incompetent themselves, if not their own fault, as the fault of a lack of resources. In the best cases, NGOs and government officials find each other's mutual strengths in [[education policy]] and find ways to practically collaborate and reach both of their objectives.<ref name=\"pdf.usaid.gov\" />\n\nTo be effective in education in Africa NGOs must effect policy and create policy changes that support their projects. NGOs also found that, to see this policy change that they are striving for, they must create and foster relationships with many different stakeholders. The most important stakeholders are usually donors and government officials. The biggest challenge for NGOs has been linking these networks together. NGO interventions to change policy have revealed that NGO programmes have failed to create a successful way to change the policy process while making sure that the public understands and is a part of education policy. This problem will prove more influential in the future if it is not solved.<ref name=\"pdf.usaid.gov\" />\n\n==Adult education==\n[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - 6 19 - School for adults in Guinea-Bissau - 1974.tiff|thumb|Open air school for adults, Guinea-Bissau, 1974.]]\n'''Adult education in Africa''', having experienced a comeback following the independence and increasing prosperity of many African nations, poses specific requirements on policymakers and planners to take into consideration indigenous cultural traits and characteristics. With a moderate backlash against Western ideals and educational traditions, many [[universities]] and other institutes of higher education take it upon themselves to develop a new approach to higher education and adult education.\n\nMost contemporary analysts regard illiteracy as a development issue because of the link between poverty and illiteracy.<ref>Nassimbeni, Mary and Bev May. \"Adult education in South African public libraries: enabling conditions and inhibiting factors\". University of Cape Town, p.3</ref> Funding is inadequate and inconsistent and is needed for priority areas such as educator training, monitoring, and evaluation.<ref name=\"Aitchison 2009, p.3\">Aitchison, John and Hassana Alidou. \"The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa\". UNESCO, 2009, p.3</ref> There is a clear need for investment in capacity development, having a full, sufficiently paid and well qualified professionalized staff, and increasing the demands for adult education professionals. The majority of adult educators are untrained, especially in basic literacy. Governments often employ schoolteachers and others in adult education posts rather than experienced adult educators.<ref name=\"Aitchison 2009, p.3\" />  Many of the difficulties experienced could be solved by allocation of resources to meet the needs (adequate funds, more staff, appropriate training for staff and suitable material). Underfunding is a huge threat to the sustainability of these programs, and in some cases, to their continued existence.<ref>Nassimbeni, Mary and Bev May. \"Adult education in South African public libraries: enabling conditions and inhibiting factors\". University of Cape Town, p.8</ref> The best-reported data on funding is about adult literacy and non-formal education programs. Funding for continuing education, either academic or vocational is provided and reported on, but little data is given on its financing. Funding may come from public or private sector sources. International and foreign aid is also likely to be important. The costs of much adult education seem to be kept artificially low by the use of state facilities and by the extremely low salaries paid to many adult education specialists.<ref>Aitchison, John and Hassana Alidou. \"The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa\". UNESCO, 2009, p.20</ref>\n\nPublic universities have not been successful in attracting older students onto mainstream degree programs and so the post-apartheid ideal of opening access to public higher education for growing numbers of non-traditional students is not yet a reality.<ref>MacGregor, Karen. \"Boom in Adult Basic Education\". University World News, 16 March 2008</ref> However, certain countries have reported some success rates in Adult Education programs.  Between 1990 and 2007 Uganda enrolled over 2million participants in the functional adult literacy program. The Family Basic Education program was active in 18 schools by 2005, reaching over 3,300 children and 1,400 parents. This is a successful family literacy mediation whose impact at household, school and community level has been evaluated.<ref>Aitchison, John and Hassana Alidou. \"The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa\". UNESCO, 2009, p.27</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, the national reports typically do not provide sufficient information on the content of the adult education programs that run in their countries. In the majority of cases the name of the program is as much detail as is given. Curriculum content does not seem to be a major issue.<ref>Aitchison, John and Hassana Alidou. \"The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa\". UNESCO, 2009, p.32</ref>\n\n===Cultural considerations===\nAfrican communities are very close knit; activities, lifestyles, particularities of individuals are nearly always common knowledge.  Because of this, it is difficult for any one member or group within an area to take a significantly different approach to any facet of life within the community.  For this reason, program planners for adult learners in Africa find higher rates of success when they employ a participatory approach.  Through open and honest dialogue about the fears, motivations, beliefs and ambitions of the community as a whole, there is less social strain concerning individual divergent behavior.\n\nIn addition to strong traditional beliefs, years of slavery through colonization have led to a sense of unity and common struggle in African communities.  Therefore, lesson plans in these areas should reflect this [[cultural sensibility]]; collaboration and cooperation are key components of successful programs.  Teaching techniques that utilize these ideas may include story-telling, experiential simulation, and the practice of indigenous traditions with slight modifications.  Every program and lesson must be tailored to the particular community because they almost always learn, live, and achieve as a group or not at all.\n\nInformal education plays a strong role within indigenous learning in African communities.  This poses a significant challenge to western-style program planners that emphasize formal learning within a designated time-frame and setting.  These requirements must often be abandoned in order to achieve success in communities that have no strong affinity for time and formal education.  Programs must be planned that become ingrained into the daily life of participants, that reflects their values and add positive functionality to their lives.  Successful programs often involve more long-term learning arrangements consisting of regular visits and the free, unforced offer of information.\n\n===Philosophies===\nAfrican philosophy of adult education recognizes the western ideas such as [[liberalism]], [[progressivism]], [[humanism]] and [[behaviorism]], while complementing them with native African perspectives.\n\n*''[[Ethnophilosophy]]'' is the idea that the main purpose of adult education is to enable social harmony at all levels of society, from immediate family to community and country.  It is of primary importance to ensure the retention of knowledge passed down from one generation to another concerning values, cultural understanding and beliefs.  This philosophy promotes active learning \u2013 learning by doing, following, practicing the work of the elders.  Particular lessons may be taught through activities such as role-play, practical demonstrations, exhibitions, discussions or competitions.<ref name=\"Nafukho\">{{cite book |first=Fredrick |last=Nafukho |author2=Amutabi, Maurice|author3= Ruth Otango |title=Foundations of Adult Education in Africa (Uie Studies) |publisher=UNESCO |year=2005 |location=Geneva}}</ref>\n*The ''[[nationalist-ideological]]'' philosophy separates itself from ethnophilosophy in that it less concerned with the methods of learning and more with its use.  As a philosophy born of the revolutionary movements of the 1950s, it is unsurprising that its main focus is to be able to apply knowledge to active participation in politics and civil society.  Although it is important in this philosophy to retain the communal nature of traditional African society, functionalism for social understanding and change takes prime importance in its implementation.\n*''Professional philosophy'' represents the strongest bridge between western and traditional African educational systems.  It promotes a hybrid approach to adult programs, allowing for a wide range of learning techniques, even purely cognitive lecture, so long as community values are accounted for within the lesson.  Finally, [[African philosophy#Ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity|philosophic sagacity]] suggests that the only true African philosophies are those that have developed with no contact with the West whatsoever.  Rather than a specific approach, this idea simply notes the huge range of educational techniques which may exist through the continent by a wide variety of people.  It essentially states that there is no one correct method, and that the subject and activities should always be set by the participants.<ref name=\"Caffarella\">{{cite book |first=Rosemary S. |last=Caffarella |title=Planning Programs for Adult Learners: A Practical Guide for Educators, Trainers, and Staff Developers |edition=2nd |publisher=Jossey-Bass |year=2001 |location=San Francisco}}</ref><ref name=\"Fasokun\">{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Fasokun |author2=Anne Katahoire|author3=Akpovire Oduaran |title=The Psychology of Adult Learning in Africa (Uie Studies) |publisher=UNESCO |year=2005 |location=Geneva}}</ref><ref name=\"Indabawa\">{{cite book |first=Indabawa |last=S. |author2=S.

Many reasons exist for why formal education for females is unavailable to so many, including cultural reasons. For example, some believe that a woman's education will get in the way of her duties as a wife and a mother. In some places in Africa where women marry at age 12 or 13, education is considered a hindrance to a young woman's development.<ref>{{cite web|title=The State of Education in Africa|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/pdf/15_58.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nA positive correlation exists between the enrollment of girls in [[primary school]] and the [[gross national product]] and increase of [[life expectancy]].\n\nWomen's education is sometimes corrupted by sexual violence.

This gender bias decision in sending females to school is also based on gender roles dictated by culture.

This limits their time to study and in many cases, may even have to miss school to complete their duties.<ref>Manuh, Takyiwaa. \"Africa Recovery/UN/Briefing Paper #11 on Women.\" Welcome to the United Nations: It's Your World. 11 Apr. 1998.

The study puts it this way: ''\u201cIn the reference year'' ''(2005), our sample of 33 countries in sub-Saharan Africa had 14.9 million pupils enrolled in the first year of secondary school. If the rate of completion of the primary stage reaches 95% by 2020 with levels of transition from primary to the first year of secondary maintained at their current level in each country, the first year of secondary school would have 37.2 million pupils in 2020, or 2.5 times the current number. If all the pupils finishing primary school could continue with their education, the number of pupils in the first year of secondary school would reach 62.9 million by 2020, a multiplication by 4.2 over the period.\u201d''<ref name=\":13\"/><ref name=\":210\">{{Cite web|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000231867_eng|title=Digital services for education in Africa|last=|first=|date=|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> Behind the regional averages, there are still enormous disparities between the countries, and even between the different zones and regions within countries, which means that it is not possible to \u201c[\u2026] identify conditions that apply uniformly to education across the different countries of sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d<ref name=\":210\"/><ref name=\":13\"/> While some countries have lower demographic growth, others enjoy a more satisfactory level of school enrolment. Only a few countries are falling seriously behind in education at the same time as having to address a steady growth in their school-age population: [[Niger]], [[Eritrea]], [[Burundi]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Uganda]] and to a lesser extent [[Burkina Faso]], [[Chad]], [[Mali]], [[Mozambique]], [[Rwanda]], [[Senegal]] and [[Malawi]] are particularly affected by this dual constraint. The EFA 2012 report highlights great disparities between the sub-Saharan African countries: the percentage of children excluded from primary school is only 7% in [[Gabon]] and 14% in Congo compared to over 55% in Burkina Faso and Niger.<ref>UNICEF. (2014). ''Global Initiative on Out-of-school Children: Regional Report, West and Central Africa.'' https://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/out-of-school-children-west-central-africa-regional-report-education-2014-en.pdf</ref> The gap in terms of the proportion of those excluded from the first year of middle school is even wider, with 6% in Gabon compared to 68% in Burkina Faso and 73% in Niger.<ref name=\":210\"/>\n\nThe majority of out-of-school populations are to be found in countries where there is conflict or very weak governance. At the Dakar Forum, the 181 signatory countries of the [[Dakar Framework for Action]] identified armed conflict as well as internal instability within a country as \u201ca major barrier towards attaining Education for All\u201d (EFA) \u2013 education being one of the sectors to suffer most from the effects of armed conflict and political instability. In the 2011 EFA Global Monitoring Report, UNESCO pointed out that the countries touched by conflict showed a gross rate of secondary school admissions almost 30% lower than countries of equivalent revenue that were at peace.<ref name=\":3\">UNESCO. (2011). The hidden crisis: armed conflict and education. ''EFA Global Monitoring Report.'' http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001907/190743e.pdf</ref> Conflicts also affect the rate of literacy of the population. At the global level, the rate of literacy among adults in countries touched by conflict was 69% in 2010 compared to 85% in peaceful countries. Twenty States in sub-Saharan Africa have been touched by conflict since 1999.<ref name=\":3\" /> Those countries affected by armed conflict, such as [[Somalia]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], are furthest from meeting the EFA goals and contain the majority of the unschooled inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in [[North Kivu]], a region particularly affected by conflicts, for example, the likelihood of young people aged between 17 and 22 having had only two years of schooling was twice the national average.<ref name=\":210\"/>\n\nLess than half the children in sub-Saharan Africa can neither read nor write: a quarter of primary school age children reach the fourth year without having acquired the basics and over a third do not reach the fourth year. [A]ccording to the 2010 EFA Global Monitoring Report, \u201cmillions of children are leaving school without having acquired basic skills. In some countries in sub-Saharan Africa, young adults with five years of education had a 40% probability of being illiterate\u201d.<ref>UNESCO. (2010). Reaching the marginalized. ''EFA Global Monitoring Report.'' http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001866/186606E.pdf</ref> The teacher training systems are generally not able to meet the quantitive and qualitative needs of training. In Chad, for example, only 35.5% of teachers are certified to teach.<ref name=\":210\"/>\n\nIn addition to lack of qualified teachers there is also the problem of extra large classrooms in public schools. In Nigeria there are schools with a teacher to pupil ratio of 80-1. This makes it difficult for personalized instruction.\n\nThere is also a lack of culturally relevant teaching-learning aids for teachers and students.\n\n== Educational technology ==\n{{Main|Educational technology in sub-Saharan Africa}}\n\nEducational technology in sub-Saharan Africa refers to the promotion, development and use of [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT), [[m-learning]], media, and other technological tools to improve aspects of education in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. Since the 1960s, various information and communication technologies have aroused strong interest in sub-Saharan Africa as a way of increasing access to education, and enhancing its quality and fairness.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf|title=Digital Services for Education in Africa|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=56}}</ref>\n\nThe development of individual computer technology has proved a major turning point in the implementation of projects dependent on technology use, and calls for the acquisition of computer skills first by teachers and then by pupils. Between 1990 and 2000, multiple actions were started in order to turn technologies into a lever for improving education in sub-Saharan Africa. Many initiatives focused on equipping schools with computer hardware. A number of NGOs contributed, on varying scales, to bringing computer hardware into Africa, such as groups like [[Computer Aid International]], Digital Links, SchoolNet Africa and [[World Computer Exchange]]. Sometimes with backing from cooperation agencies or development agencies like [[USAID]], the African Bank or the [[French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], these individual initiatives grew without adequate coordination. States found it difficult to define their national strategies with regard to [[ICT In Education|ICT in Education]].<ref name=\":210\"/>\n\nThe American [[One Laptop per Child|One Laptop per Child (OLPC)]] project, launched in several African countries in 2005, aimed to equip schools with laptop computers at low cost. While the average price of an inexpensive personal computer was between US$200 and US$500, OLPC offered its ultraportable [[XO-1 (laptop)|XO-1]] computer at the price of US$100. This technological breakthrough marked an important step in potential access to ICT. OLPC became an institutional system: the programme was \u201cbought\u201d by governments, which then took responsibility for distribution to the schools. The underlying logic of the initiative was one of centralization, thus enabling the largescale distribution of the equipment. Almost 2 million teachers and pupils are now involved in the programme worldwide (http://one.laptop.org/) and more than 2.4 million computers have been delivered.<ref name=\":210\"/> Following on from OLPC, the [[Intel|Intel group]] launched [[Classmate PC]], a similar programme also intended for pupils in developing countries. Though it has a smaller presence in sub-Saharan Africa than the OLPC project, Classmate PC has enabled laptop computers to be delivered to primary schools in the [[Seychelles]] and [[Kenya]], particularly in rural areas. Also in Kenya, the [[Computer for School in Kenya|CFSK (Computer for School in Kenya)]] project was started in 2002 with the aim of distributing computers to almost 9,000 schools.<ref name=\":210\"/>\n\nThe cross-fertilization of teaching models and tools has now broadened the potential of ICT within the educational framework. Certain technologies, perceived as outdated compared to more innovative technology, nonetheless remain very much embedded in local practice. Today they are undergoing a partial revival, thanks to the combination of different media that can be used in any single project. Despite its limited uses in teaching, radio is a medium that still has considerable reach in terms of its audience. Cheaper than a computer, it also has a cost-benefit ratio that makes it attractive to many project planners.<ref>Trucano M. (2005). Knowledge Maps: ICT in Education. Washington: infoDev/World Bank. http://www.infodev.org/infodev-files/resource/InfodevDocuments_8.pdf</ref> Launched in 2008, the [[BBC Janala]] programme, offering English courses in a combination of different media, including lessons of a few minutes via mobile phone, received more than 85,000 calls per day in the weeks following the launch of the service. In 15 months, over 10 million calls (paid, but at a reduced price compared to a normal communication) were made, by over 3 million users.<ref name=\":210\"/> Television, a feature of very many households, is witnessing a revival in its educational uses, by being combined with other media. As part of the Bridge IT programme in Tanzania, short educational videos, also available on mobile phones, are broadcast on the classroom television so that all the pupils can take part collectively. The e-Schools\u2019 Network in South Africa has also, since March 2013, been developing an educational project, the object of which is to exploit unused television frequencies. There are currently ten schools taking part in the project.<ref name=\":210\"/>\n\nAnother digital tool with multiple uses, the [[Interactive whiteboard|interactive whiteboard (IWB)]], is also being used in some schools in sub-Saharan Africa. At the end of the 2000s, the Education for All Network (REPTA), in partnership with the [[Digital solidarity fund|Worldwide Fund for Digital Solidarity (FSN)]] and, in France, the interministerial delegation for digital education in Africa (DIENA) made interactive whiteboards available to schools in Burkina Faso, Niger, Benin, Senegal and Mali, along with open content. The use of the IWB has had a positive effect on motivation, for pupils and teachers alike. However, their impact in terms of learning has been muted. This system marginalizes the direct participation of the pupils in favour of multi-media demonstrations initiated by the teacher.<ref>AFD. (2010). Bilan critique en mati\u00e8re d\u2019utilisation p\u00e9dagogique des NTIC dans le secteur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation.</ref>\n\nThe main initiatives based on the use of ICT and the Internet in education originally focused on [[distance learning]] at university level. Thus, the [[African Virtual University|African Virtual University (AVU)]], set up by the World Bank in 1997, was originally conceived as an alternative to traditional teaching. When it became an intergovernmental agency in 2003, it was training 40,000 people, mostly on short programmes. It shifted its focus to teacher training and to integrating technology into higher education. The AVU has ten e-learning centres. The [[Agence universitaire de la Francophonie|Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF)]] has also, since 1999, set up around forty Frenchspeaking digital campuses, more than half of them in Africa. In these infrastructures, dedicated to technology and set up within the universities, the AUF offers access to over 80 first and master's degrees entirely by distance learning, about 30 of which are awarded by African institutions and created with its support. More recently, the [[MOOCs|MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)]] phenomenon has grown up, first in the United States and then in Europe.<ref name=\":210\"/>\n\n==Recommendations for reform==\n\n* Government review and regulate school and district financial record-keeping.\n* More comprehensive training of head teachers and administrators in economical administration.\n* Regular government inspection of schools.\n* Encourage parents to complain or fight against schools fees and proactively help parents to know their rights.\n* Empower and mobilize local watchdog organizations such as parent-teacher organizations and school-management committees.\n* Improve teacher compensation.<ref name=\"dw-world.de\" />\n*Government investment in child and youth development through appropriate education and health policies and programmes.\n*Increase access to early childhood development programmes.\n*Increase access to schools.\n*Improve transportation infrastructure in rural areas.\n*Diversifying systems of education and broadening skills taught to make education more pertinent to the demands of the economy.\n\nThere is also a push in many African countries to reform colonial education standards to emphasize the importance of indigenous languages and cultures instead of European languages and cultures. Critics of these reforms maintain that European languages should continue to be the focus of education to ensure that African students can be competitive in a European-dominated global economy.\n\n==Recommendations for higher education reform==\n\n*[[Curriculum]] reform geared towards [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] skills and jobs in the [[private sector]].\n* Greater emphasis on locally-relevant [[diploma]] and [[Academic certificate|certificate]] programs, instead of overproducing university graduates.<ref>{{cite news| last =Kigotho| first =Wachira| title =Producing unemployable graduates wastes time and money| newspaper =University World News| date =20 March 2015| url =http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20150319130200274| accessdate =21 March 2015 }}</ref>\n*Adoption of a system of easily identifiable and comparable degrees.\n*Adoption of a system based on undergraduate and graduate degree cycles.\n*Promotion of student and faculty mobility.\n**Training and student opportunities should be accessible to students.\n**All educational faculty such as administrative staff, professors, and researchers should have access to services relevant to their fields of study.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Africa}}\n* [[Adult education in Africa]]\n* [[History of female education in Africa]]\n* [[Computers for African Schools]]\n*[[Education in Mali]]\n* [[Education in Nigeria]]\n* [[Education in Uganda]]\n* [[Education in the Middle East and Northern Africa]]\n* [[Education in South Africa]]\n* [[Education in Kenya]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Digital Services for Education in Africa\n| author = UNESCO\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf\n| license statement URL = http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=231867&set=0058F47E4D_2_3&gp=1&lin=1&ll=1\n| license = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n| Editors = \n}}\n*{{cite book|last=Aitchison|first=John|title=The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa|year=2009|publisher=UNESCO|location=Hamburg|author2=Alidou, Hassana}}\n*{{cite book|last=Nassimbeni|first=Mary|title=Adult education in South African public libraries enabling conditions and inhibiting factors|publisher=University of Cape Town|location=Cape Town|author2=May, Bev}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ajayi, J.

These schools became cultural and academic centers as many people traveled from all over the globe for knowledge and instruction. Well before contact with external cultures, Africans had developed pools of understanding and educational tools.\n\n=== Overview of Education in Colonial Africa ===\nThe onset of the colonial period in the 19th century marked the beginning of the end for traditional African education.  European forces, [[missionaries]], and colonists all came ready and willing to change existing traditions to meet their own needs and ambitions. Colonial powers such as Spain, Portugal, Belgium and France colonized the continent without putting in a system of education. Because the primary focus of colonization was reaping benefits from commercial colonial economies, cash crop production, extraction of raw materials, other physically laborious tasks were prioritized. These economies did not expand to require jobs of a higher skill set or more labor, therefore intensive labor that required little skill was high in demand. Because of such circumstances there was little demand to educate or train the colonized populations. Furthermore, colonial powers were unwilling to offer education to those they colonized unless it benefited them. Either colonial powers did not view investing in African education as a practical use of their revenue or they refrained from educating Africans in order to avoid any uprisings. Those in positions of authority were in fear of access to widespread access to higher education specifically. Colonial powers often found themselves in a debate whether or not to educate their colonized populations and if so, to what extent. Specifically, the British Education Committee of the Privy Council advocated for vocational education and training rather than one focused on academia. This vocational training however neglected professions such as engineering, technology, or similar subjects. Instead the vocational training had a dominant racial overtone which stressed African training for skills fitting with their assumed social and mental inadequacy. Notably, the Belgians under King Leopold prohibited access to higher education in their colonies whereas other colonial powers put in barriers in infrastructure or access such as limiting language of instruction to the language of the colonizer, limits on teaching curriculums, and ensuring the curriculum did not reflect any Afro-ethnicity. By demanding that communities create physical schools with strict [[curriculum]], the foreign powers were able to dictate what the people learned, adjusting it to further their agenda.  This not only forced new form and content to education, but abandoned the knowledge gained from the largely informal education.  With less community awarenaess, efficiency in learning skills, and especially understanding of the past, African communities began to dwindle in education and prosperity. Aspects of colonialism are still prevalent in African countries that struggled to escape effects of colonization today.\n\nBetween the 1950s and 1990s, African countries finally regained their independence.  With this recovered freedom, they began to rebuild their traditional forms of education.  What had inevitably evolved, however, was a hybrid of the two models. With the collaboration of donor agencies and Western demand, pushes for development of African education and the building of human capital dominated global conversation. Namely, the 1960s were known as the First Development Decade by the UN. Policymakers prioritized secondary and tertiary education before also setting their sights for universal primary education around 1980. This set the precedent for educational planning. Although children and adults may learn from their families and community, a sense of individuality has also developed that today both drives ingenuity and creates separation between groups and cultural tradition.  African education programs have developed that involve both groups; an [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] awareness program, for example, may involve members coming into communities and sharing their knowledge.  Although this is a direct, cognitive approach, they also try to involve all members of the community, allowing for the creation of ownership and cultural acceptance.\n\n=== French Colonial Africa ===\nThe use of education as a tool of colonization was widespread throughout the [[French colonial empire|French Colonial Empire]]. [[Hubert Lyautey]], the first Resident-General of [[French protectorate in Morocco|French Morocco]], advocated for the facilitation of ruling and conquest through cooperation with native elites. To facilitate the relationship with this \"bourgeois\u201d class of francophone Africans, selective educational institutions were established across the French Empire.\n\nThe teaching of the French language in Moroccan institutions of higher education, such as the University of Fez, was intended to \u201cpromote economic development and political compliance without assimilating or deracinating the students or preparing them for political agency\u201d.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Segalla|first=Spencer D.|date=2003-05-09|title=Georges Hardy and Educational Ethnology in French Morocco, 1920-26|journal=French Colonial History|volume=4|issue=1|pages=171\u2013190|doi=10.1353/fch.2003.0026|issn=1543-7787}}</ref> This system allowed colonial authorities to educate a class of native Moroccans that could carry out administrative roles and functions. In his book, ''French Colonial Education and the Making of the Francophone African Bourgeoisie,'' Program Chair of Africana Studies at [[Washington and Lee University]], Mohamed Kamara writes'','' \u201cFor the kind of society the colonialist had in mind, he must create and nurture an elite that will assist for as long as possible in the administration and exploitation of its vast overseas territories\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kamara|first=Mohamed|date=2005|title=French Colonial Education and the Making of the Francophone African Bourgeoisie|journal=Dalhousie French Studies|volume=72|pages=105\u2013114|issn=0711-8813|jstor=40837624}}</ref>\n\nIn classrooms, students were given a predetermined curriculum. The basic goal of this classroom practice was to provide only a limited selection of information for students, leaving very little margin for questioning or critical thinking. Only a limited number of families were permitted to send their children to school, which fit with the underlying goal of creating an exclusive class of native-born Moroccans, who would serve as a sort of liaison between white colonial officials and the masses.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== British Colonial Africa ===\nEducation in [[British Empire#Britain's imperial century (1815\u20131914)|British Colonial Africa]] can be characterized by three primary phases. The first of these is from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], then the [[Interwar period|Interwar Period]], and finally, the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]] until [[African independence movements|independence]].\n\nFrom the late 19th-Century until the First World War, British colonial education in Africa was largely carried out by missionaries at mission schools. Although these schools were founded with religious intent, they played a significant role in the early colonial machine. Much like in French Colonial Africa, British colonists sought out English-speaking natives who could serve as \u2018liaisons\u201d between them and the native population, however, this was done far more out of an economic incentive than a political one.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Windel|first=Aaron|date=2009|title=British Colonial Education in Africa: Policy and Practice in the Era of Trusteeship|journal=History Compass|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1\u201321|doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2008.00560.x|issn=1478-0542}}</ref> As the demand for English-speaking Africans increased, mission schools provided training in the form of teaching of the Bible. As time went on, however, British industrialists began to complain about the lack of skilled labor, and as such, the British Government supplied mission schools with grants for the vocational training of Africans in various trades critical to British industrial efforts.\n\nBritish colonial education in Africa during Interwar Period can be characterized by a push for uniformity, despite colonial authorities demonstrating their acute awareness of the notable differences between the different regions of the Empire. Critical to this, as well, was the universal recognition of nationality as a basic human right under the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]]. Colonies were, as outlined by the League of Nations, to be eventually granted independence, with the European powers entrusted as the stewards of \u201ccivilization\u201d for their respective colonies. Colonies were only to be allowed independence once they could demonstrate their capacity for self-rule.\u00a0In former Governor General of Nigeria (1914-1919), [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Lord Lugard's]], 1922 book, ''The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa'' writes,\n\n\u201c...do not enter the tropics on sufferance, or employ their technical skill, their energy, and their capital as \u2018interlopers\u2019 or as \u2018greedy capitalists\u2019, but in the fulfillment of the Mandate of civilization\u201d.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn accordance with this, in 1923 the British Government established the Advisory Committee on Education in British Tropical Africa (with the word \u2018tropical\u2019 removed to broaden its jurisdiction). With its establishment, for the first time, the colonial authority would be uniformly administering its educational goals across all British African colonies. Programs begun under the new committee were aimed at increasing the \u201cself-sufficiency\u201d of village economies and providing community incentives to counteract flight into big cities. Educational practices under the CEBA came to be known as \u2018adapted\u2019, as it was sought to adjust western education to the contemporary European understanding of the \u2018African Mind\u2019 as inherently different -\u00a0 which is to say, education was often administered through local contexts and practices, all the while teaching western curriculum. In his essay ''British Colonial Education in Africa: Policy and Practice in the Era of Trusteeship'', Aaron Windel of Bowdoin College describes this,\n\n\u201cTypical lessons in a village school operating on adapted principles focused on hygiene, vernacular word building, drill,and basic local geography. Ideally, lessons would be taught on the principle of \u2018teach by doing\u2019 and would include objects\u00a0 from village life. One geography lesson used a bicycle pump, a pail of water, and a small gourd to simulate a ship carrying sugar from India and caught in a monsoon. Adapted pedagogy could also include dramatizations of \u2018African tribal histories\u2019 or special holiday plays with an African focus\".<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost British officials (including Lord Lugard) believed that trusteeship would continue for many generations to come, and the goals of \u2018civilizing\u2019 the native population began to take precedence. Treatment of colonial subjects continued to vary wildly as determined by race, and white settlers were continuously given preferential treatment in the distribution of land, job opportunities, etc.\n\nAs British-administered schools were taking shape during the Interwar Period, a number of independent schools focusing on literacy and offering alternative curricula began to emerge. Such schools were thought of as a threat to the colonial system and colonial governments were worried that these so-called \u2018outlaw\u2019 schools would instill subversiveness and anti-colonial thought in the native populations. One such independent school was formed in [[Kenya]] among the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], and made English as its language of instruction, with the ultimate goal of enabling the Kikuyu to fight for land property rights in colonial legal and administrative bodies. Over time, as anti-colonial sentiment gained momentum, independent schools were increasingly viewed by the colonial government as breeding grounds for freedom fighters and independence advocates, which culminated in their banning in 1952 as part of the [[Mau Mau Emergency]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Education in Postcolonial Africa ==\nIn 2012, the [[United Nations]] adopted the [[Millennium Development Goals]], a set of development goals for the year 2015, more specifically, \u201cto ensure that by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike will be able to complete a full course of [[Primary education|primary schooling]].\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG_FS_2_EN.pdf|title=Millennium Development Goals Goal 2 Fact Sheet|last=|first=|date=September 2010|website=un.org|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref> That same year, the [[World Education Forum]] met in [[Dakar|Dakar, Senegal]], and adopted the Dakar Framework for Action reaffirming the commitment to achieving Education for All by the year 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-all/|title=Education for All {{!}} Education {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, according to [[UNESCO]], only 57% of African children were enrolled in primary schools, the lowest enrollment rate of any region surveyed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0015/001572/157229e.pdf|title=Regional overview: sub-Saharan Africa|last=|first=|date=2008|website=unesco.org|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref> The report also showed marked gender inequalities: in almost all countries enrollment of boys far outpaced that of girls. However, in some countries, education is relatively strong. In Zimbabwe, literacy has reached 92%.<ref>{{cite web |title=SA can learn a thing or two from Zimbabwe's education system |url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/ideas/2017-11-30-sa-can-learn-a-thing-or-two-from-zimbabwes-education-system/}}</ref>\n\nSteps such as the abolition of school fees, investments in teaching infrastructure and resources, and school meals from the [[World Food Programme]] helped drive enrollment up by millions. Yet despite the significant progress of many countries, the world fell short of meeting its goal of [[Universal Primary Education]] (UPE). In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2013, only about 79% of primary school-age children were enrolled in school.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Table-Admin-Data-updated-Oct.-2015-includes-8-tabs_77.xlsx,%20http://data.unicef.org/topic/education/overview/|title=Overview - UNICEF DATA|work=UNICEF DATA|access-date=2017-03-16}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> 59 million children of primary-school age were out of school,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:.

The fourth goal addressed education, with the stated aim to \u201censure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> The World Education Forum also convened in [[Incheon]], [[South Korea|Korea]] to discuss the implementation of this goal, and adopted the Incheon Declaration for Education 2030. It remains to be seen what effect the late12st measures have on the state of education participation in African countries.\n\nRegarding issues of quality in education and equity, there are underlying causes that deter progress such as high drop-out rates, grade repetition, poor quality of education and educational resources, teacher shortages, poor infrastructure and supplies, access to education for rural and remote areas, and stigmas for marginalized groups.\n\n===Language===\n\nDue to high linguistic diversity, the legacy of colonialism and the need for knowledge of international languages such as English and French in employment and higher education, most schooling in Africa takes places in languages that teachers and pupils do not speak natively, and in some cases simply do not understand. There is considerable evidence that pupils schooled in a second language achieve poorer results than those schooled in their mother tongue, as lack of proficiency in the second language impairs understanding and encourages ineffective rote learning.<ref>Walter, S. L. (2015). Mother Tongue-based Education in Developing Countries: Some emerging insights. Researchgate.net.</ref><ref>Dutcher, N. in collaboration with Tucker, G. R. (1997). The Use of First and Second Languages in Education: A Review of Educational Experience, Washington D.C., World Bank, Country Department III.</ref> Although UNESCO have recommended since the 1950s that children be taught early literacy in their mother tongue, progressing later to other languages, not all African countries implement this effectively. Even where the earliest grades are taught in the mother tongue, pupils are typically forced to switch to languages such as English and French before acquiring proficiency in these languages.<ref>Mehrotra, S. (1998). Education for All: Policy Lessons From High-Achieving Countries. UNICEF Staff Working Papers, New York, Unicef.</ref>\n\n===Lack of proper facilities and educators===\n\nAnother reason for the low education rates in Africa is the lack of proper schooling facilities and unequal opportunity for education across countries.  Many schools across Africa find it hard to employ teachers due to the low pay and lack of suitable people. This is particularly true for schools in remote areas. Most people who manage to receive education would prefer to move to big cities or even overseas where more opportunities and higher pay await. Thus, there will be an overly large class sizes and high average number of students per teacher in a school. Moreover, the teachers are usually those unqualified with few teaching aids and/or textbook provision. Due to this, children attending schools in rural areas usually attain poorer results in standardised tests compared to their urban counterparts. This can be seen in the reports given by the Northern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ).<ref>{{cite web|last=SACMEQ III|title=SACMEQ III Project Results: Pupil achievement levels in reading and mathematics Working Document Number 1|url=http://www.sacmeq.org/downloads/sacmeqIII/WD01_SACMEQ_III_Results_Pupil_Achievement.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727230449/http://www.sacmeq.org/downloads/sacmeqIII/WD01_SACMEQ_III_Results_Pupil_Achievement.pdf|archivedate=27 July 2011}}</ref> Those taking the tests in rural areas score much lower than those in small towns and big cities. This shows a lack of equal education opportunity given to children from different parts of the same country.\n\nWith teachers being less qualified than others in urban areas the teaching to learning environment takes an effect amongst the students. In one instance teachers took the same test as their students and three fourths of them had failed.<ref>\"End It, Don't Mend It - Our Falling Education Standards.\" Africa News Service 15 Dec. 2011. Opposing Viewpoints In Context. Web. 19 July. 2013</ref> In addition, those that do not receive the same education to those in the bigger cities have trouble even after graduation with reading, writing, and doing math.<ref>\"Sub-Saharan Africa Strengthens Advocacy for Quality Education.\" Africa News Service 10 June 2011. Opposing Viewpoints In Context. Web. 19 July. 2013.</ref> Students who do not attain the same equal education to those in urban environments do not achieve the same outcome in establishing success with a career. With education being a major concern towards achieving a career and establishing a future, Africa needs to be aware that equal education needs to be established within all schools throughout the countries.\n\n===Emigration===\n\nNext, [[emigration]] leads to a loss of highly educated people and financial loss. The loss of skilled people can only be replaced with another huge cost which imply the loss of money spent educating people who leave and new people to replace them. Even though an almost 5.5% of [[GDP]] investment in education,<ref>{{cite web|title=South Africa: fast facts|url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/facts.htm#education|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719213531/http://www.southafrica.info/about/facts.htm#education|archivedate=2008-07-19}}</ref> the loss makes it difficult for the government to budget another amount in education as they will need to prioritize other needs such as military budget and debt servicing.<ref>{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Kevin|title=Basic education for all Africans|url=https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/subjindx/134edu.htm|accessdate=11 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Culture ===\nWestern models and standards still continue to dominate African education. Because of colonization African institutions, particularly universities, still instruct using Euro-centric curriculums with almost no connection to life in Africa. This is further perpetuated by the use of European and American imported textbooks. Many view this lack of self sufficiency as an ongoing effect of colonization upheld by the modern, corrupt African elite. This attitude rests on the basis that during colonization the African ruling elite exploited their own people for their own benefit rather than advocate for the interests of their own people.\n\n=== Global water crisis ===\nThe global water crisis has severe effects on education in rural countries in Africa. Limited access to education and health issues can be further compounded by inadequate water systems or disease that may follow. Malaria, cited to be a main cause of death in Africa, is a mosquito-borne disease that can commonly be found in unmanaged pools of still water. The mosquitos breed in such pools and consequently children who drink from these pools can die or fall severely ill. Furthermore, such an intense illness can later affect the cognitive abilities of children who fall ill at a young age. This is not only applicable biologically but also as an effect of falling ill: children who miss a significant amount of school are unable to optimize their education due to missing lessons.\n\n===Military and conflict===\n\nMilitary spending is causing education spending to decrease immensely. According to a March 2011 report by [[UNESCO]], [[armed conflict]] is the biggest threat to education in Africa. While the number of dropouts across the continent has been increasing dramatically, one of the influences of war and conflict on education is the diversion of public funds from education to military spending. An already underfunded system is losing more money. Twenty-one African countries have been identified as the highest spenders of gross domestic product on military globally compared with the amount directed toward education. Military and conflict also leads to the displacement of children. It often forces them to remain in camps or flee to their neighboring countries where education is not available the world is going to explode to them.<ref name=\"War Hurting Learning in Continent\">{{cite web|title=War Hurting Learning in Continent|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/|accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Influential initiatives ==\nInitiatives to improve education in Africa include:\n\n===Intracontinental===\n\n*[[NEPAD]]'s [[NEPAD E-School programme|E-school programme]] is an ambitious plan to provide internet and computer facilities to all schools on the continent.\n*[http://www.sacmeq.org SACMEQ] is a consortium of 15 Ministries of Education in Southern and Eastern Africa which undertakes integrated research and training activities to monitor and evaluate the quality of basic education, and generates information that can be used by decision-makers to plan and improve the quality of education.\n* For 10 years, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110812083525/http://benineducationfund.org/blog/ Benin Education Fund (BEF)] has provided scholarships and education support to students from the Atakora province in northeastern Benin.

This was most often found to be because parents and communities feel as though they lack any kind of power in regard to their child's education. In [[Uganda]] only 50% of parents believe that they have the power to influence decisions regarding the education of their child. In [[Morocco]], just 20% of parents believed they held any sort of power.<ref name=\"image.guardian.co.uk\" />\n\nThe unavailability and incompleteness of records in schools and districts prevents the documentation and prevention of corrupt practices. The African Education Watch conducted surveys all over the continent and identified the three most common practices of corruption:\n\n*'''Illegal collection of fees:''' One part of their research focused on so-called registration fees. Parents from every country surveyed reported paying even though, by law, primary schooling is free. The report found that the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9% in [[Ghana]], to 90% in [[Morocco]]. An average of 44% of parents still report paying skill fees in the study. The average fee cost $4.16, a major expense for families in countries like [[Madagascar]], [[Niger]] and [[Sierra Leone]].<ref name=\"image.guardian.co.uk\" />\n*'''Embezzlement of school funds:''' In the study, [[Transparency International]] found that 64% of the schools surveyed on the continent published no financial information at all.<ref name=\"image.guardian.co.uk\" />\n*'''Power abuse:''' Another major problem is incompetent management. The report found that in many schools the little resources they did have were being wasted or lost. Overall, 85% of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all. In Morocco, just 23% of head teachers received training in financial management, despite being responsible for budgets. The TI report found that there was sexual abuse in schools from teachers. The TI report also found that many schools were plagued by teacher absenteeism and alcoholism.<ref name=\"image.guardian.co.uk\" />\n\nWithout this basic education, the report found it was nearly impossible to go on to high school or college. African children are missing this link that allows them to have a chance in trade or to go beyond their villages.\n<ref name=\"dw-world.de\">{{cite web|title=Corruption Stifles Learning in Africa, Report Finds|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5277312,00.html |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== NGO involvement ==\n\nA report by [[USAID]] and the Bureau for Africa, Office of Sustainable Development, found that NGOs are increasingly participating in contribute to the delivery of education services, education policy decisions and are included by donors and government officials in many parts of the education system. Of course, this varies country to country and region to region.\n\nNGOs working in education in Africa often encountered tension and competition when working. Schools, parents and, most often government officials, feel threatened by third-party involvement and feel that they are \"crashing the party.\" The report continues that for NGOs to be effective, they must understand that they do not have the same perspective as government officials as to who is in control. If they do not recognize the government of the country they are working in, they will compromise their objectives.<ref name=\"pdf.usaid.gov\">{{cite web|title=Evolving Partnerships: The Role of NGOs in Basic Education in Africa|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACQ444.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe report goes into more detail about [[NGO]] relations with governments in education. The relationship is viewed from completely separate points. African governments see NGOs and their work as \"an affair of government\" or, in other words, working as a part and in collaboration with the country's government. NGOs on the other hand view themselves as very separate entities in African education. They see themselves fulfilling [[moral responsibility]]. They believe that they are identifying needs or areas of development in situations under which the government has ultimately been unaccountable and separately mobilizing resources toward those needs or development areas. Government and NGOs are hold contrasting beliefs about each other's abilities. Governments often think NGOs are unqualified to make important policy decision and that they could undermine their legitimacy if seen as superior. In some cases, NGOs have found government incompetent themselves, if not their own fault, as the fault of a lack of resources. In the best cases, NGOs and government officials find each other's mutual strengths in [[education policy]] and find ways to practically collaborate and reach both of their objectives.<ref name=\"pdf.usaid.gov\" />\n\nTo be effective in education in Africa NGOs must effect policy and create policy changes that support their projects. NGOs also found that, to see this policy change that they are striving for, they must create and foster relationships with many different stakeholders. The most important stakeholders are usually donors and government officials. The biggest challenge for NGOs has been linking these networks together. NGO interventions to change policy have revealed that NGO programmes have failed to create a successful way to change the policy process while making sure that the public understands and is a part of education policy. This problem will prove more influential in the future if it is not solved.<ref name=\"pdf.usaid.gov\" />\n\n==Adult education==\n[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - 6 19 - School for adults in Guinea-Bissau - 1974.tiff|thumb|Open air school for adults, Guinea-Bissau, 1974.]]\n'''Adult education in Africa''', having experienced a comeback following the independence and increasing prosperity of many African nations, poses specific requirements on policymakers and planners to take into consideration indigenous cultural traits and characteristics.

Funding for continuing education, either academic or vocational is provided and reported on, but little data is given on its financing. Funding may come from public or private sector sources. International and foreign aid is also likely to be important. The costs of much adult education seem to be kept artificially low by the use of state facilities and by the extremely low salaries paid to many adult education specialists.<ref>Aitchison, John and Hassana Alidou. \"The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa\".

This is a successful family literacy mediation whose impact at household, school and community level has been evaluated.<ref>Aitchison, John and Hassana Alidou. \"The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa\". UNESCO, 2009, p.27</ref>\n\nUnfortunately, the national reports typically do not provide sufficient information on the content of the adult education programs that run in their countries. In the majority of cases the name of the program is as much detail as is given. Curriculum content does not seem to be a major issue.<ref>Aitchison, John and Hassana Alidou. \"The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa\". UNESCO, 2009, p.32</ref>\n\n===Cultural considerations===\nAfrican communities are very close knit; activities, lifestyles, particularities of individuals are nearly always common knowledge.  Because of this, it is difficult for any one member or group within an area to take a significantly different approach to any facet of life within the community.  For this reason, program planners for adult learners in Africa find higher rates of success when they employ a participatory approach.  Through open and honest dialogue about the fears, motivations, beliefs and ambitions of the community as a whole, there is less social strain concerning individual divergent behavior.\n\nIn addition to strong traditional beliefs, years of slavery through colonization have led to a sense of unity and common struggle in African communities.  Therefore, lesson plans in these areas should reflect this [[cultural sensibility]]; collaboration and cooperation are key components of successful programs.  Teaching techniques that utilize these ideas may include story-telling, experiential simulation, and the practice of indigenous traditions with slight modifications.  Every program and lesson must be tailored to the particular community because they almost always learn, live, and achieve as a group or not at all.\n\nInformal education plays a strong role within indigenous learning in African communities.  This poses a significant challenge to western-style program planners that emphasize formal learning within a designated time-frame and setting.  These requirements must often be abandoned in order to achieve success in communities that have no strong affinity for time and formal education.  Programs must be planned that become ingrained into the daily life of participants, that reflects their values and add positive functionality to their lives.  Successful programs often involve more long-term learning arrangements consisting of regular visits and the free, unforced offer of information.\n\n===Philosophies===\nAfrican philosophy of adult education recognizes the western ideas such as [[liberalism]], [[progressivism]], [[humanism]] and [[behaviorism]], while complementing them with native African perspectives.\n\n*''[[Ethnophilosophy]]'' is the idea that the main purpose of adult education is to enable social harmony at all levels of society, from immediate family to community and country.  It is of primary importance to ensure the retention of knowledge passed down from one generation to another concerning values, cultural understanding and beliefs.  This philosophy promotes active learning \u2013 learning by doing, following, practicing the work of the elders.  Particular lessons may be taught through activities such as role-play, practical demonstrations, exhibitions, discussions or competitions.<ref name=\"Nafukho\">{{cite book |first=Fredrick |last=Nafukho |author2=Amutabi, Maurice|author3= Ruth Otango |title=Foundations of Adult Education in Africa (Uie Studies) |publisher=UNESCO |year=2005 |location=Geneva}}</ref>\n*The ''[[nationalist-ideological]]'' philosophy separates itself from ethnophilosophy in that it less concerned with the methods of learning and more with its use.  As a philosophy born of the revolutionary movements of the 1950s, it is unsurprising that its main focus is to be able to apply knowledge to active participation in politics and civil society.  Although it is important in this philosophy to retain the communal nature of traditional African society, functionalism for social understanding and change takes prime importance in its implementation.\n*''Professional philosophy'' represents the strongest bridge between western and traditional African educational systems.  It promotes a hybrid approach to adult programs, allowing for a wide range of learning techniques, even purely cognitive lecture, so long as community values are accounted for within the lesson.  Finally, [[African philosophy#Ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity|philosophic sagacity]] suggests that the only true African philosophies are those that have developed with no contact with the West whatsoever.  Rather than a specific approach, this idea simply notes the huge range of educational techniques which may exist through the continent by a wide variety of people.  It essentially states that there is no one correct method, and that the subject and activities should always be set by the participants.<ref name=\"Caffarella\">{{cite book |first=Rosemary S. |last=Caffarella |title=Planning Programs for Adult Learners: A Practical Guide for Educators, Trainers, and Staff Developers |edition=2nd |publisher=Jossey-Bass |year=2001 |location=San Francisco}}</ref><ref name=\"Fasokun\">{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Fasokun |author2=Anne Katahoire|author3=Akpovire Oduaran |title=The Psychology of Adult Learning in Africa (Uie Studies) |publisher=UNESCO |year=2005 |location=Geneva}}</ref><ref name=\"Indabawa\">{{cite book |first=Indabawa |last=S. |author2=S.

Many reasons exist for why formal education for females is unavailable to so many, including cultural reasons. For example, some believe that a woman's education will get in the way of her duties as a wife and a mother. In some places in Africa where women marry at age 12 or 13, education is considered a hindrance to a young woman's development.<ref>{{cite web|title=The State of Education in Africa|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/pdf/15_58.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nA positive correlation exists between the enrollment of girls in [[primary school]] and the [[gross national product]] and increase of [[life expectancy]].\n\nWomen's education is sometimes corrupted by sexual violence.

This gender bias decision in sending females to school is also based on gender roles dictated by culture.

The EFA 2012 report highlights great disparities between the sub-Saharan African countries: the percentage of children excluded from primary school is only 7% in [[Gabon]] and 14% in Congo compared to over 55% in Burkina Faso and Niger.<ref>UNICEF.

At the Dakar Forum, the 181 signatory countries of the [[Dakar Framework for Action]] identified armed conflict as well as internal instability within a country as \u201ca major barrier towards attaining Education for All\u201d (EFA) \u2013 education being one of the sectors to suffer most from the effects of armed conflict and political instability. In the 2011 EFA Global Monitoring Report, UNESCO pointed out that the countries touched by conflict showed a gross rate of secondary school admissions almost 30% lower than countries of equivalent revenue that were at peace.<ref name=\":3\">UNESCO. (2011). The hidden crisis: armed conflict and education. ''EFA Global Monitoring Report.'' http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001907/190743e.pdf</ref> Conflicts also affect the rate of literacy of the population. At the global level, the rate of literacy among adults in countries touched by conflict was 69% in 2010 compared to 85% in peaceful countries. Twenty States in sub-Saharan Africa have been touched by conflict since 1999.<ref name=\":3\" /> Those countries affected by armed conflict, such as [[Somalia]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], are furthest from meeting the EFA goals and contain the majority of the unschooled inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa.

Since the 1960s, various information and communication technologies have aroused strong interest in sub-Saharan Africa as a way of increasing access to education, and enhancing its quality and fairness.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf|title=Digital Services for Education in Africa|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=56}}</ref>\n\nThe development of individual computer technology has proved a major turning point in the implementation of projects dependent on technology use, and calls for the acquisition of computer skills first by teachers and then by pupils. Between 1990 and 2000, multiple actions were started in order to turn technologies into a lever for improving education in sub-Saharan Africa. Many initiatives focused on equipping schools with computer hardware. A number of NGOs contributed, on varying scales, to bringing computer hardware into Africa, such as groups like [[Computer Aid International]], Digital Links, SchoolNet Africa and [[World Computer Exchange]]. Sometimes with backing from cooperation agencies or development agencies like [[USAID]], the African Bank or the [[French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], these individual initiatives grew without adequate coordination. States found it difficult to define their national strategies with regard to [[ICT In Education|ICT in Education]].<ref name=\":210\"/>\n\nThe American [[One Laptop per Child|One Laptop per Child (OLPC)]] project, launched in several African countries in 2005, aimed to equip schools with laptop computers at low cost. While the average price of an inexpensive personal computer was between US$200 and US$500, OLPC offered its ultraportable [[XO-1 (laptop)|XO-1]] computer at the price of US$100. This technological breakthrough marked an important step in potential access to ICT. OLPC became an institutional system: the programme was \u201cbought\u201d by governments, which then took responsibility for distribution to the schools. The underlying logic of the initiative was one of centralization, thus enabling the largescale distribution of the equipment. Almost 2 million teachers and pupils are now involved in the programme worldwide (http://one.laptop.org/) and more than 2.4 million computers have been delivered.<ref name=\":210\"/> Following on from OLPC, the [[Intel|Intel group]] launched [[Classmate PC]], a similar programme also intended for pupils in developing countries. Though it has a smaller presence in sub-Saharan Africa than the OLPC project, Classmate PC has enabled laptop computers to be delivered to primary schools in the [[Seychelles]] and [[Kenya]], particularly in rural areas. Also in Kenya, the [[Computer for School in Kenya|CFSK (Computer for School in Kenya)]] project was started in 2002 with the aim of distributing computers to almost 9,000 schools.<ref name=\":210\"/>\n\nThe cross-fertilization of teaching models and tools has now broadened the potential of ICT within the educational framework. Certain technologies, perceived as outdated compared to more innovative technology, nonetheless remain very much embedded in local practice. Today they are undergoing a partial revival, thanks to the combination of different media that can be used in any single project. Despite its limited uses in teaching, radio is a medium that still has considerable reach in terms of its audience. Cheaper than a computer, it also has a cost-benefit ratio that makes it attractive to many project planners.<ref>Trucano M. (2005). Knowledge Maps: ICT in Education. Washington: infoDev/World Bank. http://www.infodev.org/infodev-files/resource/InfodevDocuments_8.pdf</ref> Launched in 2008, the [[BBC Janala]] programme, offering English courses in a combination of different media, including lessons of a few minutes via mobile phone, received more than 85,000 calls per day in the weeks following the launch of the service. In 15 months, over 10 million calls (paid, but at a reduced price compared to a normal communication) were made, by over 3 million users.<ref name=\":210\"/> Television, a feature of very many households, is witnessing a revival in its educational uses, by being combined with other media. As part of the Bridge IT programme in Tanzania, short educational videos, also available on mobile phones, are broadcast on the classroom television so that all the pupils can take part collectively. The e-Schools\u2019 Network in South Africa has also, since March 2013, been developing an educational project, the object of which is to exploit unused television frequencies. There are currently ten schools taking part in the project.<ref name=\":210\"/>\n\nAnother digital tool with multiple uses, the [[Interactive whiteboard|interactive whiteboard (IWB)]], is also being used in some schools in sub-Saharan Africa. At the end of the 2000s, the Education for All Network (REPTA), in partnership with the [[Digital solidarity fund|Worldwide Fund for Digital Solidarity (FSN)]] and, in France, the interministerial delegation for digital education in Africa (DIENA) made interactive whiteboards available to schools in Burkina Faso, Niger, Benin, Senegal and Mali, along with open content. The use of the IWB has had a positive effect on motivation, for pupils and teachers alike. However, their impact in terms of learning has been muted. This system marginalizes the direct participation of the pupils in favour of multi-media demonstrations initiated by the teacher.<ref>AFD. (2010).

Thus, the [[African Virtual University|African Virtual University (AVU)]], set up by the World Bank in 1997, was originally conceived as an alternative to traditional teaching. When it became an intergovernmental agency in 2003, it was training 40,000 people, mostly on short programmes. It shifted its focus to teacher training and to integrating technology into higher education. The AVU has ten e-learning centres. The [[Agence universitaire de la Francophonie|Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF)]] has also, since 1999, set up around forty Frenchspeaking digital campuses, more than half of them in Africa. In these infrastructures, dedicated to technology and set up within the universities, the AUF offers access to over 80 first and master's degrees entirely by distance learning, about 30 of which are awarded by African institutions and created with its support. More recently, the [[MOOCs|MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)]] phenomenon has grown up, first in the United States and then in Europe.<ref name=\":210\"/>\n\n==Recommendations for reform==\n\n* Government review and regulate school and district financial record-keeping.\n* More comprehensive training of head teachers and administrators in economical administration.\n* Regular government inspection of schools.\n* Encourage parents to complain or fight against schools fees and proactively help parents to know their rights.\n* Empower and mobilize local watchdog organizations such as parent-teacher organizations and school-management committees.\n* Improve teacher compensation.<ref name=\"dw-world.de\" />\n*Government investment in child and youth development through appropriate education and health policies and programmes.\n*Increase access to early childhood development programmes.\n*Increase access to schools.\n*Improve transportation infrastructure in rural areas.\n*Diversifying systems of education and broadening skills taught to make education more pertinent to the demands of the economy.\n\nThere is also a push in many African countries to reform colonial education standards to emphasize the importance of indigenous languages and cultures instead of European languages and cultures. Critics of these reforms maintain that European languages should continue to be the focus of education to ensure that African students can be competitive in a European-dominated global economy.\n\n==Recommendations for higher education reform==\n\n*[[Curriculum]] reform geared towards [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] skills and jobs in the [[private sector]].\n* Greater emphasis on locally-relevant [[diploma]] and [[Academic certificate|certificate]] programs, instead of overproducing university graduates.<ref>{{cite news| last =Kigotho| first =Wachira| title =Producing unemployable graduates wastes time and money| newspaper =University World News| date =20 March 2015| url =http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20150319130200274| accessdate =21 March 2015 }}</ref>\n*Adoption of a system of easily identifiable and comparable degrees.\n*Adoption of a system based on undergraduate and graduate degree cycles.\n*Promotion of student and faculty mobility.\n**Training and student opportunities should be accessible to students.\n**All educational faculty such as administrative staff, professors, and researchers should have access to services relevant to their fields of study.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Africa}}\n* [[Adult education in Africa]]\n* [[History of female education in Africa]]\n* [[Computers for African Schools]]\n*[[Education in Mali]]\n* [[Education in Nigeria]]\n* [[Education in Uganda]]\n* [[Education in the Middle East and Northern Africa]]\n* [[Education in South Africa]]\n* [[Education in Kenya]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Digital Services for Education in Africa\n| author = UNESCO\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf\n| license statement URL = http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=231867&set=0058F47E4D_2_3&gp=1&lin=1&ll=1\n| license = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n| Editors = \n}}\n*{{cite book|last=Aitchison|first=John|title=The state and development of adult learning and education in Subsaharan Africa|year=2009|publisher=UNESCO|location=Hamburg|author2=Alidou, Hassana}}\n*{{cite book|last=Nassimbeni|first=Mary|title=Adult education in South African public libraries enabling conditions and inhibiting factors|publisher=University of Cape Town|location=Cape Town|author2=May, Bev}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ajayi, J.

{"title_page": "Retro style", "text_new": "{{redirect|Retro}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}\n\n'''Retro style'''  is a style that is imitative or consciously derivative of lifestyles, trends, or art forms from the historical past, including in music, modes, fashions, or attitudes. It may also be known as '''\"vintage inspired\"'''.{{cn|date=December 2018}} In [[popular culture]], the \"[[nostalgia]] cycle\" is typically for the two decades that are 20\u201330 years before the current one.\n\n==Definition==\nThe term ''retro'' has been in use since 1972 to describe<ref>Woodham 2004</ref> on the one hand, new artifacts that self-consciously refer to particular modes, motifs, techniques, and materials of the past.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 7</ref> But on the other hand, many people use the term to categorize styles that have been created in the past.<ref>Baker 2012, p. 622</ref> Retro style refers to new things that display characteristics of the past. Unlike the [[Historicism (art)|historicism]] of the [[Romanticism|Romantic generations]], it is mostly the recent past that retro seeks to recapitulate, focusing on the products, fashions and artistic styles produced since the Industrial Revolution, the successive styles of [[Modernity]].<ref>Guffey 2006, p. 25</ref> The English word ''retro'' derives from the [[Latin]] prefix ''retro'', meaning backwards, or in past times.\n\nIn France, the word ''r\u00e9tro'', an abbreviation for ''r\u00e9trospectif'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/r%C3%A9tro |title=French definition of ''r\u00e9tro'' |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date=1978-09-11 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref> gained cultural currency with reevaluations of [[Charles de Gaulle]] and France's role in [[World War II]].  The French ''mode r\u00e9tro'' of the 1970s reappraised in film and novels the conduct of French civilians during the Nazi occupation. The term ''r\u00e9tro'' was soon applied to nostalgic French fashions that recalled the same period.<ref>Walker, John. (1992) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/retro-style-retrochic-1992 \"Retro\"]. ''Glossary of Art, Architecture & Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed.</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter ''retro'' was introduced into English by the fashion and culture press, where it suggests a rather cynical revival of older but relatively recent fashions.<ref>Elizabeth E. Guffey, ''Retro: The Culture of Revival'', pp.&nbsp;9\u201322</ref> In ''Simulacra and Simulation'', French theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] describes ''retro'' as a demythologization of the past, distancing the present from the big ideas that drove the modern age.<ref>Baudrillard. p. 43</ref>\n\nMost commonly ''retro'' is used to describe [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and attitudes from the recent past that no longer seem modern. It suggests a fundamental shift in the way we relate to the past. Different from more traditional forms of revivalism, \"retro\" suggests a half ironic, half longing consideration of the recent past; it has been called an \"unsentimental nostalgia\",<ref>E. Guffey 2006</ref> recalling modern forms that are no longer current. The concept of [[nostalgia]] is linked to retro, but the bittersweet desire for things, persons, and situations of the past has an ironic stance in retro style. Retro shows nostalgia with a dose of cynicism and detachment.<ref>Guffey 2006, p. 20</ref> The desire to capture something from the past and evoke nostalgia is fuelled by dissatisfaction with the present.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 15</ref>\n\nRetro can be applied to several things and [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]], for example, forms of technological obsolescence (such as manual typewriters, cash registers, and bulky hand-held cellphones) and also the resurrection of old computer games and the equipment on which they are played.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n== Specific types of retro ==\n\nSince the 1980s the implications of the word \u2018retro\u2019 have been expanding<ref>Guffey 2006, p. 16</ref> in the application to different media. Several fields have adopted the term retro from the design world. Thus next to design artifacts like objects, graphic design, fashion and interior design, \u2018retro\u2019 can be used for: music, film, art, video games, architecture, television and food. \nSometimes, it can also suggest an entire outlook on life (describing especially forms of social conservatism like homeschooling or the embrace of traditional gender roles).\n\n=== Objects ===\nUp until the 1960s, interiors were often decorated with [[antique]]s. During the 1960s in London, shops started selling pieces of second-hand furniture. These shops were different from the previous antique shops because they sold daily life objects from the recent past. These objects used to be seen as junk: Victorian enamel signs, stuffed bears, old furniture painted with union jacks, bowler hats etc. A new way of producing and consuming the past emerged and a broader range of objects from the recent past was used for new designs.<ref>Baker 2012, p. 624</ref>\n\nBefore the word \u2018retro\u2019 came into use in the 1970s, the practice of adopting old styles for new designs was already common. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, designers borrowed from the past, for example, classicistic style.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 7</ref> The difference is that since the 1960s people started to refer to the recent past.\n\nIn the 1980s, design history emerged as a discipline and several histories of design were published. The access to these overviews and the ability to experiment with computer design programs has caused an increase of retro designed objects in the last decades.<ref>Dermody and Breathnach 2009, p. 11</ref>\n\n=== Interior design ===\n[[File:Poland. Gmina Raszyn. Janki 004.JPG|thumb|Retro lamp by [[IKEA]], referring to the 1970s]]\n[[Interior design]] magazines often show retro style as an interior decoration of mixed styles and objects from the past, second hand and new. For example, 1970s patterned wallpapers, combined with second-hand furniture also from the 1970s, the 1960s or 1950s. The value of old artifact has increased because the object used to be considered old-fashioned and every day.<ref>Baker 2012, p. 622</ref> In this case \u2018retro\u2019 indicates a value and that is also partly why today\u2019s retailers produce new objects in an old style.\n\n=== Graphic design, typography, and packaging ===\nIn [[graphic design]] too, long before the use of the word \u2018retro\u2019, referencing to earlier graphic characteristics was done. [[William Morris]] can be seen as an example, for i.a. book design he adopted Medieval production and stylistic models in 1891.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, pp. 7\u20138</ref> Furthermore, in the beginning of the twentieth century, Gothic, Baroque and Rococo motifs were used for new products.<ref>Heller and Lasky, 1993</ref> In [[typography]] [[classicism]] has always been an influence and throughout the 20th century, early woodcut printing too. The introduction of the technique of photocomposition to typesetting in the 1960s allowed typographers greater flexibility in the selection and arrangement of type styles and sizes. For example, psychedelic typefaces were developed gaining inspiration from Art Nouveau and other cultures.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, pp. 8-10</ref> Historicist styles are also used is in the promotion and [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]] of food and household products, referring to childhood memories and domestic nostalgic ideals.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 16</ref>\n\n=== Fashion design ===\n[[File:Karlie Kloss at Anna Sui 2011.jpg|thumb|left|A 1940s retro-style dress with turban, designed in a modern electric blue, modeled by [[Karlie Kloss]] at a 2011 [[Anna Sui]] show]] \nThe terms \"retro fashion\" and \"vintage fashion\" are sometimes used interchangeably and therefore can cause confusion as to what is really meant.  The term \"retro fashion\" (also known as \"vintage inspired\") refers to new clothing, shoes, and accessories that are designed to resemble clothing, shoes, and accessories that are at least 13 years old or older. \"Vintage fashion\" (or \"vintage clothing\") refers to the original (old) clothing the new designs are based on.  So in simple terms, new clothes that look old are called \"retro\" and clothes that look old because they ''are'' old are called \"vintage\".\n\nAn example of retro fashion is 1970s and 1980s sportswear; soccer jackets, jerseys, and T-shirts with former logos of the soccer associations are very popular; their designs commonly remember the old days by using lines in the sides and combinations of colors characteristic of those times. A specific case is the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] held in Mexico. Its logo and font type are used in a variety of retro sports garments. Brands such as [[Adidas]], [[Puma AG|Puma]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] have their own divisions specialized in retro products. Some soccer, baseball and basketball clubs also have re-edited their former garments to raise their sales. See also [[Throwback uniform]].\n\nIn the early 2010s, there was a revival of pastel and neon colors, stereotypically associated with 1980s and early 1990s fashion (with the 1980s pastel revival itself actually being a rebirth of a 1950s trend). Also in the early 2010s, late 1980s style high waisted [[mom jeans]] made a comeback with female [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]].  Nowadays, 1990s fashion has made a comeback, many of the fabrics and patterns ubiquitous to the decade (such as crushed velvet and floral) are popular now in the 2010s. [[Dr. Martens]], a shoe brand popular in the 1990s has also made a strong comeback in the early 2010s. 2011\u201312 was the British company's best selling season of all time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lauren Cochrane |url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/jul/19/dr-martens-comeback-best-selling |title=Dr Martens enjoy comeback with best-selling season ever &#124; Fashion |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref>\n\nWhen an older style of [[athletic shoe]] is manufactured again by a shoe company years or decades later it is referred to as a \"reissue\".\n\n=== Retro art ===\n[[File:CAP On the Air Force Team poster.jpg|thumb|right|A 1950s-era poster in pop-art style, the style on which retro art is based]]\n\nThe style now called \"'''retro art'''\" is a genre of [[pop art]] which was developed in the 1940s and 1950s, in response to a need for bold, eye-catching graphics that were easy to reproduce on simple [[Printing press|presses]] available at the time in major centres.  '''Retro advertising art''' has experienced a resurgence in popularity since its style is distinctive from modern computer-generated styling. Contemporary artist [[Anne Taintor]] uses retro advertising art as the centerpiece for her ongoing commentary on the modern woman. Specific styling features include analog machine design, vintage [[television program]] etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/book_review/bookulating_Suggest-O-Mometer/index.html|title=''Bookulating Suggest-O-Mometer''|accessdate=2011-10-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201093233/http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/book_review/bookulating_Suggest-O-Mometer/index.html|archivedate=2008-12-01}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of a retro pop-art character is the more generalized form of the [[Ward Cleaver]]-styled [[J. R. \"Bob\" Dobbs]]-esque icon which has been widely played off, copied, and parodied.\n\n=== Media and culture ===\n\n==== Film, music, fashion, and television ====\nThe 1970s and 1980s brought about a 1950s\u2013early '60s revival with films and television shows such as ''[[American Graffiti]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[The Outsiders]]'', ''[[Stand By Me]]'', and ''[[Back to the Future]]'' being set in this time period. There was also the [[rockabilly]] revival, the revival of [[sock hop]] school dances, [[Sha Na Na]] parodying the [[doo-wop]] of the 1950s, the [[Beach Boys]] becoming a nostalgia act after the success of their ''[[Endless Summer (Beach Boys album)|Endless Summer]]'' compilation, the 1950s [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] look greatly influencing the [[punk subculture]], and [[Billy Joel]] paying homage to 1950s doo-wop on his album ''[[An Innocent Man]]''.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s witnessed a 1960s revival with ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'', ''[[Grease 2]]'', ''[[Mermaids (1990 film)|Mermaids]]'', ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'', ''[[That Thing You Do!]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (in which the first part of this film took place in the '60s), ''[[Shag (film)|Shag]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', ''[[Austin Powers]]'', a revival of the cartoon series ''[[The Jetsons]]'' with new episodes and a [[Jetsons: The Movie|movie]], the [[power pop]] of the decade being influenced by 1960s pop rock, the [[garage rock revival]] (with bands like [[The Cynics]]), [[The Monkees]] making a resurgence in 1986, and 1960s hits covered by various artists. Examples of such covers are \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" by [[Kim Wilde]], \"[[Where Did Our Love Go?]]\" and \"[[Tainted Love]]\" by [[Soft Cell]], \"[[Spirit in the Sky]]\" by [[Doctor and the Medics]], \"[[Harlem Shuffle]]\" by [[The Rolling Stones]], \"[[Dancing in the Street]]\" by [[David Bowie]] and [[Mick Jagger]], \"[[The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)]]\" by [[Cher]], and \"[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]\" by [[Tight Fit]]. The [[British Invasion]], [[Swinging London]], and [[mod (subculture)|mod]] subcultures of the mid-1960s influenced the [[new wave]] and [[post-punk]] of the 1980s, as well as the [[Britpop]] movement of the 1990s. The [[Woodstock]] festival of 1969 was also celebrated with [[Woodstock '89|Woodstocks '89]], [[Woodstock '94|'94]], and [[Woodstock '99|'99]].\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s brought a 1970s revival. The films ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'', ''[[Detroit Rock City (film)|Detroit Rock City]]'', ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', ''[[The Stoned Age]]'', ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'' and its [[A Very Brady Sequel|sequel]] (both of which were remakes of the popular early '70s TV show ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''), ''Forrest Gump'' (in which the second part of this film took place in the '70s), and ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (in which the first part of this film took place in the late '70s) were released, along with a revival of 1970s [[disco]] and [[Pop music|pop]] led by artists such as the [[A*Teens]], the [[Spice Girls]], and [[Jamiroquai]]; [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s \"[[It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over]]\" being inspired by [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] and [[Philly soul]]; a revival of [[sideburns]], [[bell bottoms]], and [[afro]] (worn by Kravitz); the debut of the television series ''[[That '70s Show]]''; and 1970s hits covered by various artists. Examples of such covers are \"[[I Can See Clearly Now]]\" by [[Jimmy Cliff]], \"[[Baby I Love Your Way]]\" by [[Big Mountain (band)|Big Mountain]], \"[[Turn the Beat Around]]\" by [[Gloria Estefan]], \"[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]\" by [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]], \"[[O-o-h Child]]\" by [[Dino (singer)|Dino]], \"[[Wild Night]]\" by [[John Mellencamp]] and [[Meshell Ndegeocello]], \"[[Oh Girl]]\" by [[Paul Young]], \"[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]\" by [[Faith No More]], \"[[Have You Seen Her]]\" by [[MC Hammer]], \"[[Emotion (Samantha Sang song)|Emotion]]\" by the [[Bee Gees]], \"[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]\" by [[Fugees]], \"[[Love Rollercoaster]]\" by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and \"[[It Only Takes a Minute]]\" by [[Take That]]. Samples of 1970s songs were also used in hip-hop songs in the 1990s (and 2000s), most notably in the 1990s hip-hop genre [[G-funk]] and in songs such as \"[[Gangsta's Paradise]]\" by [[Coolio]]. There was also the [[garage rock]] revival in the early 2000s with bands such as [[The Strokes]], [[Jet (band)|Jet]], and [[The White Stripes]].\n\nThe late 1990s began the 1980s revival, which grew into the 2000s and 2010s. The 1980s-themed films ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'', ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'', ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (the second part of this film took place in the early '80s), and ''[[Romy and Michele's High School Reunion]]'' were released in the late 1990s. 1980s-themed films such as ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'' were released in the 2000s. This craze also brought about revivals of ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Speed Racer]]'', and ''[[Voltron  (1984 TV series)|Voltron]]''. The [[post-punk revival]] coincided with this, as the genre was originally popular (albeit underground) in the 1980s. There also was ''[[That '80s Show]]'' and ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', but both shows were short-lived (despite the latter's critical acclaim). ''[[I Love the '80s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '80s]]'', a part of a series of decade retrospectives, became the most popular of the series and spawned two sequel series. The 1980s-oriented television shows ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', ''[[The Carrie Diaries (TV series)|The Carrie Diaries]]'', ''[[GLOW (TV series)|GLOW]]'', and ''[[Stranger Things]]'' were released in 2010s, as well as the films ''[[Everybody Wants Some]]'', ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', ''[[Kung Fury]]'', and ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]''. A trend for 1980s second-wave synthpop grew at this time along with 1990s-style future house and nu-disco songs by such artists as [[Katy Perry]], [[Justin Timberlake]], and [[Bruno Mars]]. Numerous 1980s television shows and movies were revived, such as ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters (1984 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Adventures in Babysitting]]'', and ''[[Dirty Dancing (1987 film)|Dirty Dancing]]''. 1980s-influenced songs include \"[[Shut Up and Dance (Walk the Moon song)|Shut Up and Dance]] by [[Walk the Moon]], \"[[24K Magic (song)|24K Magic]]\" by Bruno Mars, \"[[Uptown Funk]]\" by [[Mark Ronson]] featuring Bruno Mars. In the 2010s, musical genres/subcultures such as [[vaporwave]], [[synthwave]], [[outrun]], [[retrowave]], and [[lo-fi music]] emerged that mimicked the aesthetics of the 1980s and 1990s; for example, palm trees on a neon galaxy grid background, or [[VHS]] scanlines. The [[Internet]] has aided in the celebration of nostalgia through the creation of these subcultures that mimic the past, oftentimes from people who were born after these decades had ended.\n\nThe 2010s and 2020s have seen a revival of the 1990s\u2013early 2000s. In 2011, TV channel [[Nickelodeon]] established the [[NickSplat]] (formerly The '90s Are All That) block on its [[TeeNick]] station featuring reruns of 1990s Nickelodeon programs, accompanied by much fanfare on [[social media]]. There have been revivals of '90s\u2013early 2000s television series such as ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[Carmen Sandiego]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Fuller House]]'', ''[[Girl Meets World]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[The Proud Family]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'', ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[Invader Zim]]'', ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'', ''[[Raven's Home]]'', ''[[Prison Break]]'', and ''[[Samurai Jack]]''. There have also been sequels/reboots to '90s\u2013early 2000s films such as ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'', ''[[Space Jam 2]]'', ''[[Jurassic World]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (2019 film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan (2020 film)|Mulan]]'', ''[[Finding Dory]]'', and ''[[The Incredibles 2]]'', as well as adaptations of '90s\u2013early 2000s franchises such as ''[[Goosebumps (film)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Artemis Fowl (film)|Artemis Fowl]]'', ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events (TV series)|A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Television series and movies set in the 1990s or early 2000s such as ''[[Everything Sucks!]]'', ''[[Fresh Off the Boat]]'', ''[[Hindsight (TV series)|Hindsight]]'', ''[[Mid90s]]'', ''[[Lady Bird]]'', and ''[[Pen15]]'' have been released. [[New jack swing]] briefly came back in style in 2018 with \"[[Finesse (song)|Finesse]]\" by Bruno Mars featuring [[Cardi B]], with a [[music video]] inspired by ''[[In Living Color]]''. The 2018 song \"[[1999 (Charli XCX and Troye Sivan song)|1999]]\" by [[Charli XCX]] and [[Troye Sivan]] paid tribute to the pop culture of the late 1990s and the \"Y2K aesthetic\". There was also an ''[[I Love the '90s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '90s]]'' series that was released in the mid-2000s.\n\n==== Retrogaming ====\n{{Main|Retrogaming}}\nRetrogaming is a pastime which is becoming increasingly popular where individuals play [[video game]]s on vintage computers or vintage game [[video game console|consoles]]. What constitutes a vintage or retro machine is sometimes open to debate, but typically, most retro gamers are interested in [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga 500]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], and classic [[Game Boy]] games and consoles.  [[Console emulation|Emulation]] often plays a part in retrogaming if the original hardware is unavailable.\n\n==== Retro erotica (photography) ====\nRetro [[erotica]] is usually [[photography]] in the style of [[Pin-up girl|pinups]] or [[pornography]] typically dating from the 1970s or earlier. It ranges from hardcore to non-nude pinup style photography, often featuring [[lingerie]] such as [[girdle]]s, bullet [[Brassiere|bras]] and [[garter belts]] and [[hosiery]] with hairstyles, makeup, and props fashioned after those periods. Some aficionados distinguish retro (modern photography in an older style) from vintage (actual period photos or film) while others conflate the two as either retro or vintage. There are a number of websites dedicated to both types.\n\n=== Aircraft ===\n[[Image:Qantas Boeing 737-800 (VH-XZP) retrojet.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Qantas]] [[Boeing 737-800]] (VH-XZP) retrojet seen at [[Sydney Airport]] ]]\nA handful of [[airline]]s have chosen to paint a historical [[aircraft livery|livery]] on a single selected [[aircraft]] in their modern fleet, typically as a marketing device or to commemorate an anniversary.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Flynn|first1=David|title=Qantas reveals 'flying kangaroo' livery on Boeing 737|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/qantas-to-unveil-retro-livery-on-boeing-737|accessdate=31 May 2015|date=17 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mutzabaugh|first1=Ben|title=Happy 85th: LOT adds 'RetroJET' livery to Embraer E175|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2014/04/18/happy-85th-lot-adds-retrojet-livery-to-embraer-e175/7865801/|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=USA Today|date=18 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Flat design]]\n* [[Kitsch]]\n* [[Irony]]\n* [[Minimalism]]\n* [[Nostalgia]]\n* [[Old school (disambiguation)|Old school]]\n* [[Ostalgie]]\n* [[Period piece]]\n* [[Retrofuturism]]\n* [[Retrotronics]]\n* [[Retro-style automobile]]\n* [[Rockabilly]]\n* [[Self-parody]]\n* [[Steampunk]]\n* [[Throwback uniform]]\n* [[Tiki culture]]\n* [[Vintage clothing]]\n* [[Vintage (design)]]\n* [[List of retro style video game consoles]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last= Baudrillard |first= Jean |authorlink= Jean Baudrillard |year= 1995 |title= Simulacra and Simulation |location= Ann Arbor |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn= 978-0-472-06521-9 |url= https://archive.org/details/simulacrasimula000baud }}\n* {{cite book |last= Collins |first= James C |authorlink= James C.

It may also be known as '''\"vintage inspired\"'''.{{cn|date=December 2018}} In [[popular culture]], the \"[[nostalgia]] cycle\" is typically for the two decades that are 20\u201330 years before the current one.\n\n==Definition==\nThe term ''retro'' has been in use since 1972 to describe<ref>Woodham 2004</ref> on the one hand, new artifacts that self-consciously refer to particular modes, motifs, techniques, and materials of the past.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 7</ref> But on the other hand, many people use the term to categorize styles that have been created in the past.<ref>Baker 2012, p. 622</ref> Retro style refers to new things that display characteristics of the past. Unlike the [[Historicism (art)|historicism]] of the [[Romanticism|Romantic generations]], it is mostly the recent past that retro seeks to recapitulate, focusing on the products, fashions and artistic styles produced since the Industrial Revolution, the successive styles of [[Modernity]].<ref>Guffey 2006, p. 25</ref> The English word ''retro'' derives from the [[Latin]] prefix ''retro'', meaning backwards, or in past times.\n\nIn France, the word ''r\u00e9tro'', an abbreviation for ''r\u00e9trospectif'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/r%C3%A9tro |title=French definition of ''r\u00e9tro'' |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date=1978-09-11 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref> gained cultural currency with reevaluations of [[Charles de Gaulle]] and France's role in [[World War II]].  The French ''mode r\u00e9tro'' of the 1970s reappraised in film and novels the conduct of French civilians during the Nazi occupation. The term ''r\u00e9tro'' was soon applied to nostalgic French fashions that recalled the same period.<ref>Walker, John. (1992) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/retro-style-retrochic-1992 \"Retro\"]. ''Glossary of Art, Architecture & Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed.</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter ''retro'' was introduced into English by the fashion and culture press, where it suggests a rather cynical revival of older but relatively recent fashions.<ref>Elizabeth E. Guffey, ''Retro: The Culture of Revival'', pp.&nbsp;9\u201322</ref> In ''Simulacra and Simulation'', French theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] describes ''retro'' as a demythologization of the past, distancing the present from the big ideas that drove the modern age.<ref>Baudrillard. p. 43</ref>\n\nMost commonly ''retro'' is used to describe [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and attitudes from the recent past that no longer seem modern. It suggests a fundamental shift in the way we relate to the past. Different from more traditional forms of revivalism, \"retro\" suggests a half ironic, half longing consideration of the recent past; it has been called an \"unsentimental nostalgia\",<ref>E. Guffey 2006</ref> recalling modern forms that are no longer current. The concept of [[nostalgia]] is linked to retro, but the bittersweet desire for things, persons, and situations of the past has an ironic stance in retro style. Retro shows nostalgia with a dose of cynicism and detachment.<ref>Guffey 2006, p. 20</ref> The desire to capture something from the past and evoke nostalgia is fuelled by dissatisfaction with the present.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 15</ref>\n\nRetro can be applied to several things and [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]], for example, forms of technological obsolescence (such as manual typewriters, cash registers, and bulky hand-held cellphones) and also the resurrection of old computer games and the equipment on which they are played.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n== Specific types of retro ==\n\nSince the 1980s the implications of the word \u2018retro\u2019 have been expanding<ref>Guffey 2006, p. 16</ref> in the application to different media. Several fields have adopted the term retro from the design world. Thus next to design artifacts like objects, graphic design, fashion and interior design, \u2018retro\u2019 can be used for: music, film, art, video games, architecture, television and food. \nSometimes, it can also suggest an entire outlook on life (describing especially forms of social conservatism like homeschooling or the embrace of traditional gender roles).\n\n=== Objects ===\nUp until the 1960s, interiors were often decorated with [[antique]]s. During the 1960s in London, shops started selling pieces of second-hand furniture. These shops were different from the previous antique shops because they sold daily life objects from the recent past. These objects used to be seen as junk: Victorian enamel signs, stuffed bears, old furniture painted with union jacks, bowler hats etc. A new way of producing and consuming the past emerged and a broader range of objects from the recent past was used for new designs.<ref>Baker 2012, p. 624</ref>\n\nBefore the word \u2018retro\u2019 came into use in the 1970s, the practice of adopting old styles for new designs was already common. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, designers borrowed from the past, for example, classicistic style.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 7</ref> The difference is that since the 1960s people started to refer to the recent past.\n\nIn the 1980s, design history emerged as a discipline and several histories of design were published. The access to these overviews and the ability to experiment with computer design programs has caused an increase of retro designed objects in the last decades.<ref>Dermody and Breathnach 2009, p. 11</ref>\n\n=== Interior design ===\n[[File:Poland. Gmina Raszyn. Janki 004.JPG|thumb|Retro lamp by [[IKEA]], referring to the 1970s]]\n[[Interior design]] magazines often show retro style as an interior decoration of mixed styles and objects from the past, second hand and new. For example, 1970s patterned wallpapers, combined with second-hand furniture also from the 1970s, the 1960s or 1950s. The value of old artifact has increased because the object used to be considered old-fashioned and every day.<ref>Baker 2012, p. 622</ref> In this case \u2018retro\u2019 indicates a value and that is also partly why today\u2019s retailers produce new objects in an old style.\n\n=== Graphic design, typography, and packaging ===\nIn [[graphic design]] too, long before the use of the word \u2018retro\u2019, referencing to earlier graphic characteristics was done. [[William Morris]] can be seen as an example, for i.a. book design he adopted Medieval production and stylistic models in 1891.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, pp. 7\u20138</ref> Furthermore, in the beginning of the twentieth century, Gothic, Baroque and Rococo motifs were used for new products.<ref>Heller and Lasky, 1993</ref> In [[typography]] [[classicism]] has always been an influence and throughout the 20th century, early woodcut printing too. The introduction of the technique of photocomposition to typesetting in the 1960s allowed typographers greater flexibility in the selection and arrangement of type styles and sizes. For example, psychedelic typefaces were developed gaining inspiration from Art Nouveau and other cultures.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, pp. 8-10</ref> Historicist styles are also used is in the promotion and [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]] of food and household products, referring to childhood memories and domestic nostalgic ideals.<ref>Dermody, Breathnach 2009, p. 16</ref>\n\n=== Fashion design ===\n[[File:Karlie Kloss at Anna Sui 2011.jpg|thumb|left|A 1940s retro-style dress with turban, designed in a modern electric blue, modeled by [[Karlie Kloss]] at a 2011 [[Anna Sui]] show]] \nThe terms \"retro fashion\" and \"vintage fashion\" are sometimes used interchangeably and therefore can cause confusion as to what is really meant.  The term \"retro fashion\" (also known as \"vintage inspired\") refers to new clothing, shoes, and accessories that are designed to resemble clothing, shoes, and accessories that are at least 13 years old or older. \"Vintage fashion\" (or \"vintage clothing\") refers to the original (old) clothing the new designs are based on.  So in simple terms, new clothes that look old are called \"retro\" and clothes that look old because they ''are'' old are called \"vintage\".\n\nAn example of retro fashion is 1970s and 1980s sportswear; soccer jackets, jerseys, and T-shirts with former logos of the soccer associations are very popular; their designs commonly remember the old days by using lines in the sides and combinations of colors characteristic of those times. A specific case is the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] held in Mexico. Its logo and font type are used in a variety of retro sports garments. Brands such as [[Adidas]], [[Puma AG|Puma]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] have their own divisions specialized in retro products. Some soccer, baseball and basketball clubs also have re-edited their former garments to raise their sales. See also [[Throwback uniform]].\n\nIn the early 2010s, there was a revival of pastel and neon colors, stereotypically associated with 1980s and early 1990s fashion (with the 1980s pastel revival itself actually being a rebirth of a 1950s trend). Also in the early 2010s, late 1980s style high waisted [[mom jeans]] made a comeback with female [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]].  Nowadays, 1990s fashion has made a comeback, many of the fabrics and patterns ubiquitous to the decade (such as crushed velvet and floral) are popular now in the 2010s. [[Dr. Martens]], a shoe brand popular in the 1990s has also made a strong comeback in the early 2010s. 2011\u201312 was the British company's best selling season of all time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lauren Cochrane |url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/jul/19/dr-martens-comeback-best-selling |title=Dr Martens enjoy comeback with best-selling season ever &#124; Fashion |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref>\n\nWhen an older style of [[athletic shoe]] is manufactured again by a shoe company years or decades later it is referred to as a \"reissue\".\n\n=== Retro art ===\n[[File:CAP On the Air Force Team poster.jpg|thumb|right|A 1950s-era poster in pop-art style, the style on which retro art is based]]\n\nThe style now called \"'''retro art'''\" is a genre of [[pop art]] which was developed in the 1940s and 1950s, in response to a need for bold, eye-catching graphics that were easy to reproduce on simple [[Printing press|presses]] available at the time in major centres.  '''Retro advertising art''' has experienced a resurgence in popularity since its style is distinctive from modern computer-generated styling. Contemporary artist [[Anne Taintor]] uses retro advertising art as the centerpiece for her ongoing commentary on the modern woman. Specific styling features include analog machine design, vintage [[television program]] etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/book_review/bookulating_Suggest-O-Mometer/index.html|title=''Bookulating Suggest-O-Mometer''|accessdate=2011-10-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201093233/http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/book_review/bookulating_Suggest-O-Mometer/index.html|archivedate=2008-12-01}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of a retro pop-art character is the more generalized form of the [[Ward Cleaver]]-styled [[J. R. \"Bob\" Dobbs]]-esque icon which has been widely played off, copied, and parodied.\n\n=== Media and culture ===\n\n==== Film, music, fashion, and television ====\nThe 1970s and 1980s brought about a 1950s\u2013early '60s revival with films and television shows such as ''[[American Graffiti]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[The Outsiders]]'', ''[[Stand By Me]]'', and ''[[Back to the Future]]'' being set in this time period. There was also the [[rockabilly]] revival, the revival of [[sock hop]] school dances, [[Sha Na Na]] parodying the [[doo-wop]] of the 1950s, the [[Beach Boys]] becoming a nostalgia act after the success of their ''[[Endless Summer (Beach Boys album)|Endless Summer]]'' compilation, the 1950s [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] look greatly influencing the [[punk subculture]], and [[Billy Joel]] paying homage to 1950s doo-wop on his album ''[[An Innocent Man]]''.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s witnessed a 1960s revival with ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'', ''[[Grease 2]]'', ''[[Mermaids (1990 film)|Mermaids]]'', ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'', ''[[That Thing You Do!]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (in which the first part of this film took place in the '60s), ''[[Shag (film)|Shag]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', ''[[Austin Powers]]'', a revival of the cartoon series ''[[The Jetsons]]'' with new episodes and a [[Jetsons: The Movie|movie]], the [[power pop]] of the decade being influenced by 1960s pop rock, the [[garage rock revival]] (with bands like [[The Cynics]]), [[The Monkees]] making a resurgence in 1986, and 1960s hits covered by various artists. Examples of such covers are \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" by [[Kim Wilde]], \"[[Where Did Our Love Go?]]\" and \"[[Tainted Love]]\" by [[Soft Cell]], \"[[Spirit in the Sky]]\" by [[Doctor and the Medics]], \"[[Harlem Shuffle]]\" by [[The Rolling Stones]], \"[[Dancing in the Street]]\" by [[David Bowie]] and [[Mick Jagger]], \"[[The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)]]\" by [[Cher]], and \"[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]\" by [[Tight Fit]]. The [[British Invasion]], [[Swinging London]], and [[mod (subculture)|mod]] subcultures of the mid-1960s influenced the [[new wave]] and [[post-punk]] of the 1980s, as well as the [[Britpop]] movement of the 1990s. The [[Woodstock]] festival of 1969 was also celebrated with [[Woodstock '89|Woodstocks '89]], [[Woodstock '94|'94]], and [[Woodstock '99|'99]].\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s brought a 1970s revival. The films ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'', ''[[Detroit Rock City (film)|Detroit Rock City]]'', ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', ''[[The Stoned Age]]'', ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'' and its [[A Very Brady Sequel|sequel]] (both of which were remakes of the popular early '70s TV show ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''), ''Forrest Gump'' (in which the second part of this film took place in the '70s), and ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (in which the first part of this film took place in the late '70s) were released, along with a revival of 1970s [[disco]] and [[Pop music|pop]] led by artists such as the [[A*Teens]], the [[Spice Girls]], and [[Jamiroquai]]; [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s \"[[It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over]]\" being inspired by [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] and [[Philly soul]]; a revival of [[sideburns]], [[bell bottoms]], and [[afro]] (worn by Kravitz); the debut of the television series ''[[That '70s Show]]''; and 1970s hits covered by various artists. Examples of such covers are \"[[I Can See Clearly Now]]\" by [[Jimmy Cliff]], \"[[Baby I Love Your Way]]\" by [[Big Mountain (band)|Big Mountain]], \"[[Turn the Beat Around]]\" by [[Gloria Estefan]], \"[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]\" by [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]], \"[[O-o-h Child]]\" by [[Dino (singer)|Dino]], \"[[Wild Night]]\" by [[John Mellencamp]] and [[Meshell Ndegeocello]], \"[[Oh Girl]]\" by [[Paul Young]], \"[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]\" by [[Faith No More]], \"[[Have You Seen Her]]\" by [[MC Hammer]], \"[[Emotion (Samantha Sang song)|Emotion]]\" by the [[Bee Gees]], \"[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]\" by [[Fugees]], \"[[Love Rollercoaster]]\" by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and \"[[It Only Takes a Minute]]\" by [[Take That]]. Samples of 1970s songs were also used in hip-hop songs in the 1990s (and 2000s), most notably in the 1990s hip-hop genre [[G-funk]] and in songs such as \"[[Gangsta's Paradise]]\" by [[Coolio]]. There was also the [[garage rock]] revival in the early 2000s with bands such as [[The Strokes]], [[Jet (band)|Jet]], and [[The White Stripes]].\n\nThe late 1990s began the 1980s revival, which grew into the 2000s and 2010s. The 1980s-themed films ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'', ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'', ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (the second part of this film took place in the early '80s), and ''[[Romy and Michele's High School Reunion]]'' were released in the late 1990s. 1980s-themed films such as ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'' were released in the 2000s. This craze also brought about revivals of ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Speed Racer]]'', and ''[[Voltron  (1984 TV series)|Voltron]]''. The [[post-punk revival]] coincided with this, as the genre was originally popular (albeit underground) in the 1980s. There also was ''[[That '80s Show]]'' and ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', but both shows were short-lived (despite the latter's critical acclaim). ''[[I Love the '80s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '80s]]'', a part of a series of decade retrospectives, became the most popular of the series and spawned two sequel series. The 1980s-oriented television shows ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', ''[[The Carrie Diaries (TV series)|The Carrie Diaries]]'', ''[[GLOW (TV series)|GLOW]]'', and ''[[Stranger Things]]'' were released in 2010s, as well as the films ''[[Everybody Wants Some]]'', ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', ''[[Kung Fury]]'', and ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]''. A trend for 1980s second-wave synthpop grew at this time along with 1990s-style future house and nu-disco songs by such artists as [[Katy Perry]], [[Justin Timberlake]], and [[Bruno Mars]]. Numerous 1980s television shows and movies were revived, such as ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters (1984 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Adventures in Babysitting]]'', and ''[[Dirty Dancing (1987 film)|Dirty Dancing]]''. 1980s-influenced songs include \"[[Shut Up and Dance (Walk the Moon song)|Shut Up and Dance]] by [[Walk the Moon]], \"[[24K Magic (song)|24K Magic]]\" by Bruno Mars, \"[[Uptown Funk]]\" by [[Mark Ronson]] featuring Bruno Mars. In the 2010s, musical genres/subcultures such as [[vaporwave]], [[synthwave]], [[outrun]], [[retrowave]], and [[lo-fi music]] emerged that mimicked the aesthetics of the 1980s and 1990s; for example, palm trees on a neon galaxy grid background, or [[VHS]] scanlines. The [[Internet]] has aided in the celebration of nostalgia through the creation of these subcultures that mimic the past, oftentimes from people who were born after these decades had ended.\n\nThe 2010s and 2020s have seen a revival of the 1990s\u2013early 2000s. In 2011, TV channel [[Nickelodeon]] established the [[NickSplat]] (formerly The '90s Are All That) block on its [[TEENick]] station featuring reruns of 1990s Nickelodeon programs, accompanied by much fanfare on [[social media]]. There have been revivals of '90s\u2013early 2000s television series such as ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[Carmen Sandiego]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Fuller House]]'', ''[[Girl Meets World]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[The Proud Family]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'', ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[Invader Zim]]'', ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'', ''[[Raven's Home]]'', ''[[Prison Break]]'', and ''[[Samurai Jack]]''. There have also been sequels/reboots to '90s\u2013early 2000s films such as ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'', ''[[Space Jam 2]]'', ''[[Jurassic World]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (2019 film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan (2020 film)|Mulan]]'', ''[[Finding Dory]]'', and ''[[The Incredibles 2]]'', as well as adaptations of '90s\u2013early 2000s franchises such as ''[[Goosebumps (film)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Artemis Fowl (film)|Artemis Fowl]]'', ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events (TV series)|A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Television series and movies set in the 1990s or early 2000s such as ''[[Everything Sucks!]]'', ''[[Fresh Off the Boat]]'', ''[[Hindsight (TV series)|Hindsight]]'', ''[[Mid90s]]'', ''[[Lady Bird]]'', and ''[[Pen15]]'' have been released. [[New jack swing]] briefly came back in style in 2018 with \"[[Finesse (song)|Finesse]]\" by Bruno Mars featuring [[Cardi B]], with a [[music video]] inspired by ''[[In Living Color]]''. The 2018 song \"[[1999 (Charli XCX and Troye Sivan song)|1999]]\" by [[Charli XCX]] and [[Troye Sivan]] paid tribute to the pop culture of the late 1990s and the \"Y2K aesthetic\". There was also an ''[[I Love the '90s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '90s]]'' series that was released in the mid-2000s.\n\n==== Retrogaming ====\n{{Main|Retrogaming}}\nRetrogaming is a pastime which is becoming increasingly popular where individuals play [[video game]]s on vintage computers or vintage game [[video game console|consoles]]. What constitutes a vintage or retro machine is sometimes open to debate, but typically, most retro gamers are interested in [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga 500]], [[Atari 2600]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], and classic [[Game Boy]] games and consoles.  [[Console emulation|Emulation]] often plays a part in retrogaming if the original hardware is unavailable.\n\n==== Retro erotica (photography) ====\nRetro [[erotica]] is usually [[photography]] in the style of [[Pin-up girl|pinups]] or [[pornography]] typically dating from the 1970s or earlier. It ranges from hardcore to non-nude pinup style photography, often featuring [[lingerie]] such as [[girdle]]s, bullet [[Brassiere|bras]] and [[garter belts]] and [[hosiery]] with hairstyles, makeup, and props fashioned after those periods. Some aficionados distinguish retro (modern photography in an older style) from vintage (actual period photos or film) while others conflate the two as either retro or vintage. There are a number of websites dedicated to both types.\n\n=== Aircraft ===\n[[Image:Qantas Boeing 737-800 (VH-XZP) retrojet.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Qantas]] [[Boeing 737-800]] (VH-XZP) retrojet seen at [[Sydney Airport]] ]]\nA handful of [[airline]]s have chosen to paint a historical [[aircraft livery|livery]] on a single selected [[aircraft]] in their modern fleet, typically as a marketing device or to commemorate an anniversary.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Flynn|first1=David|title=Qantas reveals 'flying kangaroo' livery on Boeing 737|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/qantas-to-unveil-retro-livery-on-boeing-737|accessdate=31 May 2015|date=17 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mutzabaugh|first1=Ben|title=Happy 85th: LOT adds 'RetroJET' livery to Embraer E175|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2014/04/18/happy-85th-lot-adds-retrojet-livery-to-embraer-e175/7865801/|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=USA Today|date=18 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Flat design]]\n* [[Kitsch]]\n* [[Irony]]\n* [[Minimalism]]\n* [[Nostalgia]]\n* [[Old school (disambiguation)|Old school]]\n* [[Ostalgie]]\n* [[Period piece]]\n* [[Retrofuturism]]\n* [[Retrotronics]]\n* [[Retro-style automobile]]\n* [[Rockabilly]]\n* [[Self-parody]]\n* [[Steampunk]]\n* [[Throwback uniform]]\n* [[Tiki culture]]\n* [[Vintage clothing]]\n* [[Vintage (design)]]\n* [[List of retro style video game consoles]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last= Baudrillard |first= Jean |authorlink= Jean Baudrillard |year= 1995 |title= Simulacra and Simulation |location= Ann Arbor |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn= 978-0-472-06521-9 |url= https://archive.org/details/simulacrasimula000baud }}\n* {{cite book |last= Collins |first= James C |authorlink= James C.

They are various [[ester]]s of [[cyanoacrylic acid]]. The [[acryl group]]s in the [[resin]] rapidly [[polymer]]ize in the presence of water to form long, strong chains. They have some minor toxicity.\n \nSpecific cyanoacrylates include [[methyl cyanoacrylate|methyl 2-cyanoacrylate]] (MCA), [[ethyl cyanoacrylate|ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate]] (ECA, commonly sold under trade names such as \"Super Glue\" and \"Krazy Glue\", or Toagosei), [[butyl cyanoacrylate|''n''-butyl cyanoacrylate]] (n-BCA), [[octyl cyanoacrylate]] and [[2-octyl cyanoacrylate]] (used in medical, veterinary and first aid applications). Octyl cyanoacrylate was developed to address toxicity concerns and to reduce skin irritation and allergic response. Cyanoacrylate adhesives are sometimes known generically as '''instant glues''', '''power glues''' or '''superglues'''. The abbreviation \"CA\" is commonly used for industrial grade cyanoacrylate.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Harry Wesley Coover Jr.png|thumb|Harry Wesley Coover Jr. shortly before being awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2010]]\nThe original patent for cyanoacrylate was filed in 1942 by the B.F. Goodrich Company<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ardis|first1=Alan|title=Patent for synthesis of cyanoacrylate|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2467927|website=Google patents|accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> as an outgrowth of a search for materials suitable for clear plastic [[Sight (device)|gun sights]] for [[World War II|the war]] effort. In 1942, a team of scientists headed by [[Harry Coover]] Jr. stumbled upon a formulation that stuck to everything with which it came in contact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/coover.html |title=Inventor of the Week Archive |date=September 2004 |publisher=Lemelson-MIT Program |accessdate=13 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503111504/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/coover.html |archivedate=3 May 2009 }}</ref> The team quickly rejected the substance for the wartime application, but in 1951, while working as researchers for [[Eastman Kodak]], Coover and a colleague, Fred Joyner, rediscovered cyanoacrylates. The two realized the true commercial potential, and a form of the adhesive was first sold in 1958 under the title \"Eastman #910\" (later \"Eastman 910\").\n\nDuring the 1960s, Eastman Kodak sold cyanoacrylate to [[Loctite]], which in turn repackaged and distributed it under a different brand name \"Loctite Quick Set 404\". In 1971, Loctite developed its own manufacturing technology and introduced its own line of cyanoacrylate, called \"Super Bonder\". Loctite quickly gained market share, and by the late 1970s it was believed to have exceeded Eastman Kodak's share in the North American industrial cyanoacrylate market. National Starch and Chemical Company purchased Eastman Kodak's cyanoacrylate business and combined it with several acquisitions made throughout the 1970s forming Permabond. Other manufacturers of cyanoacrylate include LePage (a Canadian company acquired by [[Henkel]] in 1996), the Permabond Division of National Starch and Chemical, which was a subsidiary of [[Unilever]]. Together, Loctite, Eastman and Permabond accounted for approximately 75% of the industrial cyanoacrylate market.<ref>HBS, \"Loctite Corporation: Industrial Product Group,\" 15 July 1991, p.3</ref> {{As of|2019}} Permabond continued to manufacture the original 910 formula.<ref>https://www.permabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/910_TDS.pdf |date=August 2019</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nIn its liquid form, cyanoacrylate consists of [[monomer]]s of cyanoacrylate ester molecules. Methyl 2-cyanoacrylate (CH<sub>2</sub>=C(C\u2261N)COOCH<sub>3</sub>) has a [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] of 111.1&nbsp;g/mol, a [[Flash point|flashpoint]] of {{Cvt|79|C|F K}}, and a density of 1.1&nbsp;g/mL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics1272.htm|title=ICSC 1272 - METHYL 2-CYANOACRYLATE}}</ref> Ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate ((CH<sub>2</sub>=C(C\u2261N)COOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>)) has a molecular weight of 125&nbsp;g/mol and a flashpoint of more than {{Cvt|75|C|F K}}. To facilitate easy handling, a cyanoacrylate adhesive is frequently formulated with an ingredient such as [[fumed silica]] to make it more [[viscous]] or gel-like. More recently, formulations are available with additives to increase [[shear strength]], creating a more impact resistant bond. Such additives may include [[Natural rubber|rubber]], as in Loctite's \"Ultra Gel\", or others which are not specified.\n\nIn general, the acryl groups rapidly undergo [[chain-growth polymerisation]] in the presence of water (specifically [[hydroxide ion]]s), forming long, strong chains, joining the bonded surfaces together. Because the presence of moisture causes the glue to set, exposure to normal levels of [[humidity]] in the air causes a thin skin to start to form within seconds, which very greatly slows the reaction; hence, cyanoacrylates are applied as thin coats to ensure that the reaction proceeds rapidly for bonding.\n\nCyanoacrylate adhesives have a short [[shelf life]]\u2014about one year from manufacture if unopened, and one month once opened. The reaction with moisture can cause a container of glue which has been opened and resealed to become unusable more quickly than if never opened. To minimise this reduction in shelf life, cyanoacrylate, once opened, should be stored in an airtight container with a package of [[silica gel]] [[desiccant]]. Another technique is to insert a [[hypodermic needle]] into the opening of a tube. After using the glue, residual glue soon clogs the needle, keeping moisture out. The clog is removed by heating the needle (e.g. with a lighter) before use.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The polymerisation is also temperature-dependent: storage below freezing point of water, {{Cvt|0|C|F K}}, stops the reaction, so keeping it in the freezer is also effective.\n[[Image:Cyanacrylat polymerisation.svg|thumb|center|585px|Polymerization of methyl 2-cyanoacrylate]]\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Super glue.jpg|thumb|A tube of \"Super Glue\", a cyanoacrylate glue]]\n\n===Behaviours===\nCyanoacrylates are mainly used as adhesives. They require some care and knowledge for effective use: they do not bond some materials; they do not fill spaces, unlike [[epoxy|epoxies]], and a very thin layer bonds more effectively than a thicker one that does not cure properly; they bond many substances, including human skin and tissues. They have an [[exothermic]] reaction to natural fibres: cotton, wool, leather, see [[Cyanoacrylate#cotton|reaction with cotton]] below.\n\nCyanoacrylate glue has a low [[Shearing (physics)|shearing]] strength, which has led to its use as a temporary adhesive in cases where the piece needs to be sheared off later. Common examples include mounting a workpiece to a sacrificial glue block on a [[lathe]], and tightening pins and bolts. It is also used in conjunction with another, slower, but more resilient adhesive as a way of rapidly forming a joint, which then holds the pieces in the appropriate configuration until the second adhesive has set.\n\nCyanoacrylate-based glue has a weak bond with smooth surfaces and as such easily gives to friction; a good example of this is the fact that cyanoacrylates may be removed from human skin by means of abrasives (e.g. sugar or sandpaper).\n\n===Electronics===\nCyanoacrylates are used to assemble prototype [[electronics]] (used in [[wire wrap]]), flying [[model aircraft]], and as retention dressings for [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[screw#bolt|bolt]]s. Their effectiveness in bonding metal and general versatility have made them popular among [[scale model|modeling]] and [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]] hobbyists.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Aquaria===\nCyanoacrylate glue's ability to resist water has made it popular with [[marine aquarium]] hobbyists for [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmenting]] corals. The cut branches of [[Scleractinia|hard corals]], such as [[Acropora]], can be glued to a piece of [[live rock]] (harvested reef coral) or [[Milliput]] (epoxy putty) to allow the new fragment to grow out. It is safe to use directly in the tank, unlike [[silicone]] which must be cured to be safe. However, as a class of adhesives, traditional cyanoacrylates are classified as having \"weak\" resistance to both moisture and heat<ref>{{Cite book |last = Petrie |first = Edward M. |title = Handbook of adhesives and sealants |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2000 |location = New York |page = 354 |isbn = 978-0-07-049888-4}}</ref> although the inclusion of [[phthalic anhydride]] reportedly counteracts both of these characteristics.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Petrie |first = Edward M. |title = Handbook of adhesives and sealants |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2000 |location = New York |page = 389 |isbn = 978-0-07-049888-4}}</ref> Cyanoacrylate glue is also used frequently in [[aquascaping]] both freshwater and marine aquariums for the purpose of securing the rhizomes of live plants to pieces of wood or stone.\n\n===Smooth surfaces===\nMost standard cyanoacrylate adhesives do not bond well with smooth [[glass]], although they can be used as a quick, temporary bond prior to application of an epoxy or cyanoacrylate specifically formulated for use on glass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/conservationmanual/File5.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203232512/http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/conservationmanual/File5.htm |archivedate=3 December 2014 }}</ref> A [[Adhesion#Mechanical|mechanical adhesive]] bond may be formed around [[glass fibre]] mat or tissue to reinforce joints or to fabricate small parts.\n\n===Filler===\nWhen added to baking soda ([[sodium bicarbonate]]), cyanoacrylate glue forms a hard, lightweight adhesive filler.

They are various [[ester]]s of [[cyanoacrylic acid]]. The [[acryl group]]s in the [[resin]] rapidly [[polymer]]ize in the presence of water to form long, strong chains. They have some minor toxicity.\n \nSpecific cyanoacrylates include [[methyl cyanoacrylate|methyl 2-cyanoacrylate]] (MCA), [[ethyl cyanoacrylate|ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate]] (ECA, commonly sold under trade names such as \"Super Glue\" and \"Krazy Glue\", or Toagosei), [[butyl cyanoacrylate|''n''-butyl cyanoacrylate]] (n-BCA), [[octyl cyanoacrylate]] and [[2-octyl cyanoacrylate]] (used in medical, veterinary and first aid applications). Octyl cyanoacrylate was developed to address toxicity concerns and to reduce skin irritation and allergic response. Cyanoacrylate adhesives are sometimes known generically as '''instant glues''', '''power glues''' or '''superglues'''. The abbreviation \"CA\" is commonly used for industrial grade cyanoacrylate.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Harry Wesley Coover Jr.png|thumb|Harry Wesley Coover Jr. shortly before being awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2010]]\nThe original patent for cyanoacrylate was filed in 1942 by the B.F.

The two realized the true commercial potential, and a form of the adhesive was first sold in 1958 under the title \"Eastman #910\" (later \"Eastman 910\").\n\nDuring the 1960s, Eastman Kodak sold cyanoacrylate to [[Loctite]], which in turn repackaged and distributed it under a different brand name \"Loctite Quick Set 404\". In 1971, Loctite developed its own manufacturing technology and introduced its own line of cyanoacrylate, called \"Super Bonder\". Loctite quickly gained market share, and by the late 1970s it was believed to have exceeded Eastman Kodak's share in the North American industrial cyanoacrylate market. National Starch and Chemical Company purchased Eastman Kodak\u2019s cyanoacrylate business and combined it with several acquisitions made throughout the 1970s forming Permabond. Other manufacturers of cyanoacrylate include LePage (a Canadian company acquired by [[Henkel]] in 1996), the Permabond Division of National Starch and Chemical, which was a subsidiary of [[Unilever]]. Together, Loctite, Eastman and Permabond accounted for approximately 75% of the industrial cyanoacrylate market.<ref>HBS, \"Loctite Corporation: Industrial Product Group,\" 15 July 1991, p.3</ref> {{As of|2019}} Permabond continued to manufacture the original 910 formula.<ref>https://www.permabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/910_TDS.pdf |date=August 2019</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nIn its liquid form, cyanoacrylate consists of [[monomer]]s of cyanoacrylate ester molecules. Methyl 2-cyanoacrylate (CH<sub>2</sub>=C(C\u2261N)COOCH<sub>3</sub>) has a [[Molecular mass|molecular weight]] of 111.1&nbsp;g/mol, a [[Flash point|flashpoint]] of {{Cvt|79|C|F K}}, and a density of 1.1&nbsp;g/mL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics1272.htm|title=ICSC 1272 - METHYL 2-CYANOACRYLATE}}</ref> Ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate ((CH<sub>2</sub>=C(C\u2261N)COOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>)) has a molecular weight of 125&nbsp;g/mol and a flashpoint of more than {{Cvt|75|C|F K}}. To facilitate easy handling, a cyanoacrylate adhesive is frequently formulated with an ingredient such as [[fumed silica]] to make it more [[viscous]] or gel-like. More recently, formulations are available with additives to increase [[shear strength]], creating a more impact resistant bond. Such additives may include [[Natural rubber|rubber]], as in Loctite's \"Ultra Gel\", or others which are not specified.\n\nIn general, the acryl groups rapidly undergo [[chain-growth polymerisation]] in the presence of water (specifically [[hydroxide ion]]s), forming long, strong chains, joining the bonded surfaces together. Because the presence of moisture causes the glue to set, exposure to normal levels of [[humidity]] in the air causes a thin skin to start to form within seconds, which very greatly slows the reaction; hence, cyanoacrylates are applied as thin coats to ensure that the reaction proceeds rapidly for bonding.\n\nCyanoacrylate adhesives have a short [[shelf life]]\u2014about one year from manufacture if unopened, and one month once opened. The reaction with moisture can cause a container of glue which has been opened and resealed to become unusable more quickly than if never opened. To minimise this reduction in shelf life, cyanoacrylate, once opened, should be stored in an airtight container with a package of [[silica gel]] [[desiccant]]. Another technique is to insert a [[hypodermic needle]] into the opening of a tube. After using the glue, residual glue soon clogs the needle, keeping moisture out. The clog is removed by heating the needle (e.g. with a lighter) before use.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The polymerisation is also temperature-dependent: storage below freezing point of water, {{Cvt|0|C|F K}}, stops the reaction, so keeping it in the freezer is also effective.\n[[Image:Cyanacrylat polymerisation.svg|thumb|center|585px|Polymerization of methyl 2-cyanoacrylate]]\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Super glue.jpg|thumb|A tube of \"Super Glue\", a cyanoacrylate glue]]\n\n===Behaviours===\nCyanoacrylates are mainly used as adhesives. They require some care and knowledge for effective use: they do not bond some materials; they do not fill spaces, unlike [[epoxy|epoxies]], and a very thin layer bonds more effectively than a thicker one that does not cure properly; they bond many substances, including human skin and tissues. They have an [[exothermic]] reaction to natural fibres: cotton, wool, leather, see [[Cyanoacrylate#cotton|reaction with cotton]] below.\n\nCyanoacrylate glue has a low [[Shearing (physics)|shearing]] strength, which has led to its use as a temporary adhesive in cases where the piece needs to be sheared off later. Common examples include mounting a workpiece to a sacrificial glue block on a [[lathe]], and tightening pins and bolts. It is also used in conjunction with another, slower, but more resilient adhesive as a way of rapidly forming a joint, which then holds the pieces in the appropriate configuration until the second adhesive has set.\n\nCyanoacrylate-based glue has a weak bond with smooth surfaces and as such easily gives to friction; a good example of this is the fact that cyanoacrylates may be removed from human skin by means of abrasives (e.g. sugar or sandpaper).\n\n===Electronics===\nCyanoacrylates are used to assemble prototype [[electronics]] (used in [[wire wrap]]), flying [[model aircraft]], and as retention dressings for [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[screw#bolt|bolt]]s. Their effectiveness in bonding metal and general versatility have made them popular among [[scale model|modeling]] and [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]] hobbyists.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Aquaria===\nCyanoacrylate glue's ability to resist water has made it popular with [[marine aquarium]] hobbyists for [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmenting]] corals. The cut branches of [[Scleractinia|hard corals]], such as [[Acropora]], can be glued to a piece of [[live rock]] (harvested reef coral) or [[Milliput]] (epoxy putty) to allow the new fragment to grow out. It is safe to use directly in the tank, unlike [[silicone]] which must be cured to be safe. However, as a class of adhesives, traditional cyanoacrylates are classified as having \"weak\" resistance to both moisture and heat<ref>{{Cite book |last = Petrie |first = Edward M.  |title = Handbook of adhesives and sealants |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2000 |location = New York |page = 354 |isbn = 978-0-07-049888-4}}</ref> although the inclusion of [[phthalic anhydride]] reportedly counteracts both of these characteristics.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Petrie |first = Edward M.  |title = Handbook of adhesives and sealants |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2000 |location = New York |page = 389 |isbn = 978-0-07-049888-4}}</ref>  Cyanoacrylate glue is also used frequently in [[aquascaping]] both freshwater and marine aquariums for the purpose of securing the rhizomes of live plants to pieces of wood or stone.\n\n===Smooth surfaces===\nMost standard cyanoacrylate adhesives do not bond well with smooth [[glass]], although they can be used as a quick, temporary bond prior to application of an epoxy or cyanoacrylate specifically formulated for use on glass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/conservationmanual/File5.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203232512/http://nautarch.tamu.edu/crl/conservationmanual/File5.htm |archivedate=3 December 2014 }}</ref> A [[Adhesion#Mechanical|mechanical adhesive]] bond may be formed around [[glass fibre]] mat or tissue to reinforce joints or to fabricate small parts.\n\n===Filler===\nWhen added to baking soda ([[sodium bicarbonate]]), cyanoacrylate glue forms a hard, lightweight adhesive filler.

The use of oil, such as [[boiled linseed oil]], may be used to control the rate at which the cyanoacrylate cures.  Cyanoacrylate glue is also used in combination with [[sawdust]] (from a saw or sanding) to fill voids and cracks.  These repair methods are used on piano [[Sound board (music)|soundboards]], wood instruments, and wood furniture. Cyanoacrylate glue is also used in the finishing of pen blanks (wooden blanks for turning pens) that have been turned on a lathe by applying multiple thin layers to build up a hard, clear finish that can then be sanded and polished to a glossy finish.\n\n===Medical and veterinary===\n[[File:Incision wound on child's arm, closed with Dermabond.jpg|alt=The arm of a child with a small cut, with a shiny layer of adhesive covering the cut region|thumb|An incision wound closed with Dermabond, a cyanoacrylate-based medical adhesive]]\nCyanoacrylate glue was in veterinary use for mending bone, hide, and tortoise shell by the early 1970s or before.

In 1770 heiress Margaret Dixon married William Brown. Their daughter later married [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] merchant, Lt. Col. William Clark, [[Deputy Lieutenant]] and [[High Sheriff of Northumberland]]\nwho, in 1818, remodelled the house and added two new wings, with the assistance of architect [[John Dobson (architect)|John Dobson]].\n\nAn extensive park, created in the mid 18th century, retains several original features and has been designated a [[conservation area]]. An 18th-century folly in the park is a [[Grade II listed building]]. During [[World War II]] the Hall was requisitioned by the [[British Army|Army]] and thereafter became neglected and dilapidated. In the 1980s it was acquired by the Northern Heritage Trust, renovated and restored and converted to residential flats.\n\n[[File:Spindlestone Ducket Mill.jpg|thumb|Spindlestone Ducket Mill]]\n\n===Spindlestone Ducket Mill===\nThis is located about 3&nbsp;km east of Belford, and is an 18th-century tapering cylindrical stone tower with a conical roof of Welsh slate.

The moat that surrounded the original building can still clearly be seen. It is now in use as a farmhouse.\n\n==History==\nFor much of the Middle Ages, Belford was at the forefront of the ongoing border conflict between the Scots and the English and it is believed that only Well House escaped damage or destruction at the hands of Scottish raiders. In 1272 it is recorded that [[Walter de Huntercombe, 1st Baron Huntercombe|Walter de Huntercombe]], the Lord of the Manor, was charged with 'assisting pirates'! They had seized, by force, goods belonging to some wealthy Spanish merchants and landed with their booty on Holy Island.<ref>{{cite book|last=Local History Society|first=Belford and District|title=Bygone Belford|year=2010|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, Ayrshire|isbn=9781840335170|pages=3\u20134|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=638}}</ref>\n\nIn 1726, A wealthy city merchant, [[Abraham Dixon]] bought the Belford Estate. He made improvements which enhanced the fortunes of its inhabitants significantly including purchasing a licence in 1742 allowing him to hold a weekly market and two annual fairs at Belford.
