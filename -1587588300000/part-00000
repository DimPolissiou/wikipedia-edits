The higher the orbit, the more test data [Orbcomm] can gather, so they requested that we attempt to restart and raise altitude. NASA agreed to allow that, but only on condition that there be substantial propellant reserves, since the orbit would be close to the space station.  It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative. They accepted that there was a high risk of their satellite remaining at the Dragon insertion orbit.

The higher the orbit, the more test data [Orbcomm] can gather, so they requested that we attempt to restart and raise altitude. NASA agreed to allow that, but only on condition that there be substantial propellant reserves, since the orbit would be close to the space station.  It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative. They accepted that there was a high risk of their satellite remaining at the Dragon insertion orbit. SpaceX would not have agreed to fly their satellite otherwise, since this was not part of the core mission and there was a known, material risk of no altitude raise.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121114anomalies/|title=Dragon Mission Report|last=Clark|first=Stephen|date=November 14, 2012|work=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=November 10, 2017}}</ref> \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center;\" | 5\n| March 1, 2013 <br />15:10\n| [[Falcon 9 v1.0|F9 v1.0]]<ref name=MuskMay2012/><br />B0007<ref name=block_numbers/>\n| [[CCAFS]] <br />[[LC-40]]\n| [[SpaceX CRS-2]]<ref name=sxManifest20120925 /><br>(Dragon C105)\n| {{convert|677|kg|disp=br()|abbr=on}}{{efn|name=DryDragon}}\n| [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]] ([[ISS]])\n| [[NASA]] ([[Commercial Resupply Services|CRS]])\n| {{Success}}\n| style=\"background:#ececec; text-align:center;\" | {{nobr|No attempt}}\n|-\n| colspan=9 | Last launch of the original Falcon 9 v1.0 [[launch vehicle]], first use of the unpressurized trunk section of Dragon.<ref name=\"sxf9_20110321\"/>\n\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center;\" | 6\n| {{nobr|September 29,}} 2013 <br />16:00<ref name=pa20130930/>\n| [[Falcon 9 v1.1|F9 v1.1]]<ref name=MuskMay2012/><br />B1003<ref name=block_numbers/>\n| [[VAFB]] <br />[[SLC-4E]]\n| [[CASSIOPE]]<ref name=sxManifest20120925 /><ref name=\"CASSIOPE_MDA\">\n {{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/003/120518musk/|title=Dragon Mission Report &#124; Q&A with SpaceX founder and chief designer Elon Musk|last=Clark|first=Stephen|date=May 18, 2012|work=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=May 25, 2012}}</ref>\n| {{convert|500|kg|disp=br()|abbr=on}}\n| [[Polar orbit|Polar]] [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]]\n| [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates|MDA]]\n| {{Success}}<ref name=pa20130930/>\n| {{no2|Uncontrolled}} <br /> <small>(ocean)</small>{{efn|name=ocean landing}}\n|-\n| colspan=9 | First commercial mission with a private customer, first launch from Vandenberg, and demonstration flight of Falcon 9 v1.1 with an improved 13-tonne to LEO capacity.<ref name=\"sxf9_20110321\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php |title=Falcon 9 Overview |date=May 27, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012 |publisher=[[SpaceX]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118103620/http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}</ref> After separation from the second stage carrying Canadian commercial and scientific satellites, the first stage booster performed a controlled reentry,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/007/ses8_presskit.pdf|title=SES-8 Mission Press Kit|date=November 2013|publisher=SpaceX|via=spaceflightnow.com|access-date=1 September 2019}}</ref> and an [[Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests|ocean touchdown test]] for the first time.

The film is a [[remake]] of [[Dino Risi]]'s 1974 Italian film ''[[Scent of a Woman (1974 film)|Profumo di donna]]'',  [[Film adaptation|adapted]] by [[Bo Goldman]] from the novel ''{{ill|Il buio e il miele|it}}'' ({{lang-it|Darkness and Honey}}) by [[Giovanni Arpino]] and from the 1974 screenplay by [[Ruggero Maccari]] and [[Dino Risi]]. The film stars [[Al Pacino]] and [[Chris O'Donnell]], with [[James Rebhorn]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] and [[Gabrielle Anwar]].\n\nPacino won the [[65th Academy Awards|Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance and the film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published]]. The film won three major awards at the [[Golden Globe Award]]s: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Pacino Gives Oscar Derby a New Twist : Awards: Actor wins Golden Globe for role in 'Scent of a Woman,' which also wins as best dramatic picture, surprising Academy Awards competitors. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1993-01-25|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-25/entertainment/ca-1588_1_golden-globe-awards|accessdate=2010-11-14|first=David J.|last=Fox}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot primarily around [[New York (state)|New York state]], and also on location at [[Princeton University]], at the [[Emma Willard School]], an all-girls school in [[Troy, New York]], and at the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School]] in [[New York City]].\n\n==Plot==\nCharlie Simms is a student at the Baird School, an exclusive New England [[University-preparatory school#United States and Canada|prep school]]. Unlike most of his peers, Charlie was not born into a wealthy family, and attends the school on a scholarship. Charlie accepts a temporary job over [[Thanksgiving]] weekend in order to afford a plane ticket home to [[Oregon]] for Christmas. The woman who hires him asks Charlie to watch over her uncle, retired [[United States Army|Army]] [[Officer_(armed_forces)|Officer]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Frank Slade, whom Charlie discovers to be a cantankerous, blind alcoholic. Charlie and George Willis, Jr., another student at the Baird School, witness three students setting up a prank that publicly humiliates the headmaster, Mr. Trask. Incensed over the prank, Trask quickly learns of the two student witnesses and presses Charlie and George to divulge the names of the perpetrators. Once George has left the office, Trask offers Charlie a bribe: a letter of recommendation that would virtually guarantee his acceptance to [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. Charlie remains silent, but is conflicted about what to do. Shortly after Charlie arrives, Frank unexpectedly whisks Charlie off on a trip to [[New York City]]. Frank reserves a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]]. During dinner at the [[Oak Room (Plaza Hotel)|Oak Room]], Frank glibly states the goals of the trip, which involve enjoying luxurious accommodations in New York before committing [[suicide]]. Charlie is taken aback and does not know if Frank is serious. They pay an uninvited visit to Frank's brother's home in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] for Thanksgiving dinner. Frank is an unpleasant surprise for the family, as he deliberately provokes everyone and the night ends in acrimony. During this time, the cause of Frank's blindness is also revealed: he was juggling live hand grenades, showing off for a group of second lieutenants, and one of the grenades exploded.\n\nAs they return to New York City, Charlie tells Frank about his complications at school. Frank advises Charlie to inform on his classmates and go to Harvard, warning him that George will probably give in to the pressure to talk, and Charlie had better cash in before George does. Later at a restaurant, Frank is aware of Donna, a young woman waiting for her date. Although blind, Frank leads Donna in a spectacular [[Tango (dance)|tango]] (''\"[[Por una Cabeza]]\"'') on the dance floor. That night, he hires a [[Call girl|female escort]]. Deeply despondent the next morning, Frank is initially uninterested in Charlie's proposals for something to do until he suggests they test drive a 1989 [[Ferrari Mondial#Mondial t|Ferrari Mondial t Cabriolet]]. Frank smooth-talks the initially-reluctant Ferrari dealership salesman into letting Charlie, who Frank says is his son, test-drive the car. Once on the road, Frank is unenthusiastic until Charlie allows him to drive, quickly getting the attention of a police officer. Once again being calm and charming in a potentially difficult situation, Frank talks the officer into letting them go without giving away his blindness. After returning the Ferrari and waiting to cross the street, Frank grows impatient and walks into the middle of traffic on [[Park Avenue]], where he narrowly avoids being struck by multiple cars. He then attempts to publicly urinate before being stopped by Charlie out of fear of Frank being arrested. When they return to the hotel, Frank sends Charlie out on a list of errands. Charlie initially leaves the room but quickly becomes suspicious. Charlie returns to find Frank in uniform and preparing to commit suicide with his service pistol. Charlie intervenes and they enter a tense fight, with both grappling for the gun; however, Frank backs down after Charlie bravely calms him. The two return to New England.\n\nAt school, Charlie and George are subjected to a formal inquiry in front of the entire student body and the student/faculty disciplinary committee. As Headmaster Trask is opening the proceedings, Frank unexpectedly returns to the school, joining Charlie on the auditorium stage for support. For his defense, George has enlisted the help of his wealthy father, using his poor vision as an excuse before naming all three of the perpetrators. When pressed for more details, George passes the burden to Charlie. Although struggling with his decision, Charlie gives no information, so Trask recommends Charlie's expulsion. Frank cannot contain himself and launches into a passionate speech defending Charlie and reminding the country's future elite and its trainers of the value of integrity. After brief deliberations, the disciplinary committee decide to place the students named by George on probation, deny George of any accolades for his testimony and excuse Charlie from punishment, allowing him to have no further involvement in the proceedings. As Charlie escorts Frank to his limo, Frank flirts with a young political science professor, and is returned home by Charlie, where Frank happily greets his niece's young children.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States Army)| Lt.

When pressed for more details, George passes the burden to Charlie. Although struggling with his decision, Charlie gives no information, so Trask recommends Charlie's expulsion. Frank cannot contain himself and launches into a passionate speech defending Charlie and reminding the country's future elite and its trainers of the value of integrity. After brief deliberations, the disciplinary committee decide to place the students named by George on probation, deny George of any accolades for his testimony and excuse Charlie from punishment, allowing him to have no further involvement in the proceedings. As Charlie escorts Frank to his limo, Frank flirts with a young political science professor, and is returned home by Charlie, where Frank happily greets his niece's young children.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States Army)| Lt.

Quoitze Ow was his birth name.<ref>Hittman,\"Wovoka And The Ghost Dance:Expanded Edition\" (Lincoln, Nebraska:University of Nebraska:Press 1997) 47</ref> Wovoka's father was Numu-tibo'o (sometimes called Tavibo), who for several decades was incorrectly believed to be [[Wodziwob]], a religious leader who had founded the Ghost Dance of 1870.<ref>Du Bois, Cora \"The 1870 Ghost Dance\"  ''Anthropological Records'' Vol. 3, No. 1 (1939) (Berkeley, California; University of California Press) 3-4</ref> From the age of eight until almost thirty Wovoka often worked for David Wilson, a [[rancher]] in the [[Yerington, Nevada]] area, and his wife Abigail, who gave him the name Jack Wilson when dealing with European Americans.<ref>Hittman, Michael ''Wovoka And The Ghost Dance: Expanded Edition'' (Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press 1997) 27-28</ref> David Wilson was a devout [[Christians|Christian]], and Wovoka learned [[Christian theology]] and [[Bible stories]] while living with him.<ref>Hittman, ''Wovoka'' 55-56</ref>\n\nOne of his chief sources of authority among Paiutes was his alleged ability to control the weather.  He was said to have caused a block of ice to fall out of the sky on a summer day, to be able to end drought with rain or snow, to light his pipe with the sun, and to form icicles in his hands.<ref>{{cite book |title= Wovoka and the ghost dance|last=Hittman |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8032-7308-5|page=69}}</ref>\n\nWovoka claimed to have had a [[prophet]]ic vision during the [[solar eclipse of January 1, 1889]]. Wovoka's vision entailed the [[resurrection]] of the Paiute dead, and the removal of whites and their works from [[North America]]. Wovoka taught that in order to bring this vision to pass, the Native Americans must live righteously and perform a traditional round dance, known as the [[Ghost Dance]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAnthropologists, historians, and theologians provide conflicting accounts on when and how Wovoka had his vision. One scholar of religions, Tom Thatcher, cites James Mooney's Smithsonian-sponsored anthropological report to claim that Wovoka received his first vision while chopping wood for David Wilson in 1887.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thatcher|first=Tom|date=Autumn 1998|title=Empty Metaphors and Apocalyptic Rhetoric|jstor=1466133|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|volume=66|pages=549\u2013570|doi=10.1093/jaarel/66.3.549}}</ref> Conversely, historian Paul Bailey utilized Mooney's work along with interviews with Wovoka's contemporaries and interpreters to assert that he received the vision after entering a two-day trance, awaking in tears.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wovoka: The Indian Messiah|last=Bailey|first=Paul|publisher=Westernlore Press|year=1957|isbn=9781258823382|location=Los Angeles|pages=79\u201383}}</ref> Regardless, shortly after receiving the vision and its message, it moved quickly beyond his local Paiute community by word of mouth to Native American tribes further east, notably the [[Lakota people|Lakota]].\n\nThe Ghost Dance movement is known for being practiced by the victims of the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]]. Before the Ghost dance reached Native Americans on South Dakota plains reservations, interest in the movement came from U.S. [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Office]],  [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]], and multiple Native American tribal delegations. Many tribes would arrive in Mason to listen to Wovoka intently, but language barriers existed. Visiting tribes came from different cultures, geographies, and linguistic traditions. Few delegation members could speak Wovoka's mother tongue of Paiute. This led to tribes adopting a militant form of Wovoka's teachings that emphasized an impending battle leading to the creation of the [[Ghost shirt|Ghost Shirts]] worn by Sioux and Lakota at the subsequent massacre.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=McCann Jr.|first=Frank D.|year=1966|title=The Ghost Dance, Last hope of Western Tribes, Unleashed the Final Tragedy|jstor=4517018|journal=Montana: The Magazine of Western History|volume=16|pages=25\u201334}}</ref>  Other Native American Leaders, such as  [[Miniconjou]], [[Arnold Short Bull|Short Bull]] and [[Kicking Bear]] allegedly adopted violent interpretations that emphasized the possible elimination of whites. However, Wovoka never left his home in Nevada to become an active participant in the dance's dissemination in the U.S. interior.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wovoka: The Indian Messiah|last=Bailey|first=Paul|publisher=Westernlore Press|year=1957|isbn=9781258823382|location=Los Angeles|pages=171}}</ref>\n\nIndian Agents, soldiers, and other federal officials were predisposed towards a militaristic posture and outright violence upon encountering the movement.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Post-Wounded Knee life and death==\nWovoka was disheartened by how events unfolded at the massacre. He still remained a prominent Native American leader until his death.<ref name=\":22\"/>  Sometime between 1894-1896, he was reported to have been a sideshow attraction at a San Francisco Midwinter Fair Carnival.

Wovoka's vision entailed the [[resurrection]] of the Paiute dead, and the removal of whites and their works from [[North America]]. Wovoka taught that in order to bring this vision to pass, the Native Americans must live righteously and perform a traditional round dance, known as the [[Ghost Dance]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAnthropologists, historians, and theologians provide conflicting accounts on when and how Wovoka had his vision. One scholar of religions, Tom Thatcher, cites James Mooney's Smithsonian-sponsored anthropological report to claim that Wovoka received his first vision while chopping wood for David Wilson in 1887.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thatcher|first=Tom|date=Autumn 1998|title=Empty Metaphors and Apocalyptic Rhetoric|jstor=1466133|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|volume=66|pages=549\u2013570|doi=10.1093/jaarel/66.3.549}}</ref> Conversely, historian Paul Bailey utilized Mooney's work along with interviews with Wovoka's contemporaries and interpreters to assert that he received the vision after entering a two-day trance, awaking in tears.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wovoka: The Indian Messiah|last=Bailey|first=Paul|publisher=Westernlore Press|year=1957|isbn=9781258823382|location=Los Angeles|pages=79\u201383}}</ref> Regardless, shortly after receiving the vision and its message, it moved quickly beyond his local Paiute community by word of mouth to Native American tribes further east, notably the [[Lakota people|Lakota]].\n\nThe Ghost Dance movement is known for being practiced by the victims of the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]]. Before the Ghost dance reached Native Americans on South Dakota plains reservations, interest in the movement came from U.S. [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Office]],  [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]], and multiple Native American tribal delegations. Many tribes would arrive in Mason to listen to Wovoka intently, but language barriers existed. Visiting tribes came from different cultures, geographies, and linguistic traditions. Few delegation members could speak Wovoka's mother tongue of Paiute. This led to tribes adopting a militant form of Wovoka's teachings that emphasized an impending battle leading to the creation of the [[Ghost shirt|Ghost Shirts]] worn by Sioux and Lakota at the subsequent massacre.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=McCann Jr.|first=Frank D.|year=1966|title=The Ghost Dance, Last hope of Western Tribes, Unleashed the Final Tragedy|jstor=4517018|journal=Montana: The Magazine of Western History|volume=16|pages=25\u201334}}</ref>  Other Native American Leaders, such as  [[Miniconjou]], [[Arnold Short Bull|Short Bull]] and [[Kicking Bear]] allegedly adopted violent interpretations that emphasized the possible elimination of whites.

I do not imagine that in the history of human events any poet has ever felt inspired so clearly to portray our danger and our duty. It is called \"The White Man\u2019s Burden.\" With the permission of Senators I will read a stanza, and I beg Senators to listen to it, for it is well worth their attention.
