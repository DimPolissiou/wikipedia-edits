Normally, A1AT leaves its site of origin, the [[liver]], and joins the [[circulatory system#Systemic circulation|systemic circulation]]; defective A1AT can fail to do so, building up in the liver, which results in [[cirrhosis]] in either adults or [[pediatrics|children]].\n\nIn addition to binding to neutrophil elastase released by inflammatory cells, A1AT also binds to elastase localized on the cell surface in which case elastase does not act as an enzyme, but instead acts to signal cells to undergo  locomotion.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guttman O, Baranovski BM, Schuster R, Kaner Z, Freixo-Lima GS, Bahar N, Mizrahi MI, Brami I, Ochayon DE, Lewis EC | title = Acute-phase protein \u03b11-anti-trypsin: diverting injurious innate and adaptive immune responses from non-authentic threats | journal = Clinical & Experimental Immunology | volume = 179 | issue = 2 | pages = 161\u2013172 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25351931 | pmc = 4298394 | doi = 10.1111/cei.12476 }}</ref>.

These enzymes are released locally in relatively low concentrations where they are immediately cleared by proteins such as A1AT. In the [[acute phase protein|acute phase reaction]], a further elevation is required to \"limit\" the damage caused by activated [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s and their enzyme [[elastase]], which breaks down the [[connective tissue]] fiber [[elastin]]. \n\nBesides limiting elastase activity to limit tissue degradation, A1PI also acts to induce locomotion of lymphocytes through tissue including immature T cells through the thymus where immature T cells mature to become immunocompetent T cells that are released into tissue to elevate immune responsiveness. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lapidot T, Petit I | title = Current understanding of stem cell mobilization: the roles of chemokines, proteolytic enzymes, adhesion molecules, cytokines, and stromal cells | journal = Exp Hematol | volume = 30 | issue = 9 | pages = 973\u2013981 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 12225788 | doi = 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)00883-4 }}</ref>\n\nLike all [[serine protease inhibitor]]s, A1AT has a characteristic [[secondary structure]] of [[beta sheet]]s and [[alpha helix|alpha helices]].

Trypsin, a type of [[peptidase]], is a digestive enzyme active in the [[duodenum]] and elsewhere.\n\nThe term ''alpha-1'' refers to the protein's behavior on [[protein electrophoresis]]. On electrophoresis, the protein component of the blood is separated by [[electric current]]. There are several ''clusters'', the first being [[serum albumin|albumin]], the second being the ''alpha'', the third ''beta'' and the fourth ''gamma'' ([[immunoglobulin]]s). The non-albumin proteins are referred to as [[globulin]]s.\n\nThe ''alpha'' region can be further divided into two sub-regions, termed \"1\" and \"2\". Alpha-1 antitrypsin is the main [[protein]] of the [[alpha-globulin]] 1 region.\n\nAnother name used is ''alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor'' (\u03b1<sub>1</sub>-PI).\n\n== Genetics ==\nThe [[gene]] is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 14]] (14q32.1).\n\nOver 100 different variants of \u03b1<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin have been described in various populations. North-Western [[Europe]]ans are most at risk for carrying one of the most common mutant forms of A1AT, the Z mutation (Glu342Lys on M1A, rs28929474).\n\n== Biochemical properties ==\nA1AT is a single-chain glycoprotein consisting of 394 amino acids in the mature form and exhibits many [[glycoform]]s. The three N-linked glycosylations sites are mainly equipped with so-called diantennary N-[[glycans]]. However, one particular site shows a considerable amount of heterogeneity since tri- and even tetraantennary N-[[glycans]] can be attached to the [[Asparagine]] 107 ([[UniProtKB]] amino acid nomenclature). These [[glycans]] carry different amounts of negatively charged sialic acids; this causes the heterogeneity observed on normal A1AT when analysed by [[isoelectric focusing]]. Also, the fucosylated triantennary N-glycans were shown to have the [[fucose]] as part of a so-called [[Sialyl Lewis x]] [[epitope]], which could confer this [[protein]] particular protein-cell recognition properties. The single [[cysteine]] residue of A1AT in position 256 ([[UniProtKB]] nomenclature) is found to be covalently linked to a free single [[cysteine]] by a [[disulfide bridge]].<ref name=Kolarich_2006>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kolarich D, Weber A, Turecek PL, Schwarz HP, Altmann F | title = Comprehensive glyco-proteomic analysis of human alpha1-antitrypsin and its charge isoforms | journal = Proteomics | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 3369\u201380 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16622833 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200500751 }}</ref>\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe level of A1AT in serum is most often determined by adding an antibody that binds to A1AT, then using [[turbidimetry]] to measure how much A1AT is present. Other detection methods include the use of enzyme-linked-immuno-sorbent-assays and radial immunodiffusion.\n\nDifferent analytical methods are used to determine A1AT [[phenotype]]. As [[protein]] [[electrophoresis]] is imprecise, the A1AT phenotype is analysed by [[isoelectric focusing]] (IEF) in the pH range 4.5-5.5, where the protein migrates in a gel according to its isoelectric point or charge in a [[pH]] gradient.\n\nNormal A1AT is termed ''M'', as it migrates toward the center of such an IEF gel. Other variants are less functional and are termed A-L and N-Z, dependent on whether they run proximal or distal to the M band. The presence of deviant bands on IEF can signify the presence of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency|alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]].  Since the number of identified mutations has exceeded the number of letters in the alphabet, subscripts have been added to most recent discoveries in this area, as in the Pittsburgh mutation described above.\n\nAs every person has two [[allele|copies]] of the A1AT [[gene]], a [[heterozygote]] with two different copies of the gene may have two different bands showing on electrofocusing, although heterozygote with one null mutant that abolishes expression of the gene will only show one band.\n\nIn [[blood test]] results, the IEF results are notated as in ''P<sub>i</sub>''MM, where ''P<sub>i</sub>'' stands for [[protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitor]] and \"MM\" is the banding pattern of that patient.\n\n''Alpha-1 antitrypsin'' levels in the blood depend on the [[genotype]]. Some mutant forms fail to fold properly and are, thus, targeted for destruction in the [[proteasome]], whereas others have a tendency to [[polymer]]ise, being retained in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. The serum levels of some of the common genotypes are:\n\n* PiMM: 100% (normal)\n* PiMS: 80% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiSS: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiMZ: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiSZ: 40% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiZZ: 10-15% (severe [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency|alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]])\n* PiZ is caused by a [[glutamate]] to [[lysine]] mutation at position 342 (366 in pre-processed form)\n* PiS is caused by a [[glutamate]] to [[valine]] mutation at position 264 (288 in pre-processed form)\nOther rarer forms have been described; in all, there are over 80 variants.\n\n== Medical use ==\n{{drugbox\n| verifiedrevid = 477318673\n| IUPAC_name = Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor\n| image = A1AT.png\n<!--Clinical data -->\n| pregnancy_category = \n| legal_status = \n| routes_of_administration = intravenous\n<!--Pharmacokinetic data -->\n| bioavailability = \n| protein_bound = \n| metabolism = \n| elimination_half-life = \n<!--Identifiers -->\n| CAS_number_Ref = {{cascite|correct|??}}\n| CAS_number = 9041-92-3\n| ATC_prefix = B02\n| ATC_suffix = AB02\n| ATC_supplemental = \n| ChemSpiderID_Ref = {{chemspidercite|correct|chemspider}}\n| ChemSpiderID = none\n| PubChem = \n| DrugBank_Ref = {{drugbankcite|correct|drugbank}}\n| DrugBank = DB00058\n<!--Chemical data -->\n| C=2001 | H=3130 | N=514 | O=601 | S=10\n| molecular_weight = 44324.5 g/mol\n}}\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin concentrates are prepared from the [[blood plasma]] of blood donors.

Trypsin, a type of [[peptidase]], is a digestive enzyme active in the [[duodenum]] and elsewhere.\n\nThe term ''alpha-1'' refers to the protein's behavior on [[protein electrophoresis]]. On electrophoresis, the protein component of the blood is separated by [[electric current]]. There are several ''clusters'', the first being [[serum albumin|albumin]], the second being the ''alpha'', the third ''beta'' and the fourth ''gamma'' ([[immunoglobulin]]s). The non-albumin proteins are referred to as [[globulin]]s.\n\nThe ''alpha'' region can be further divided into two sub-regions, termed \"1\" and \"2\". Alpha-1 antitrypsin is the main [[protein]] of the [[alpha-globulin]] 1 region.\n\nAnother name used is ''alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor'' (\u03b1<sub>1</sub>-PI).\n\n== Genetics ==\nThe [[gene]] is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 14]] (14q32.1).\n\nOver 100 different variants of \u03b1<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin have been described in various populations. North-Western [[Europe]]ans are most at risk for carrying one of the most common mutant forms of A1AT, the Z mutation (Glu342Lys on M1A, rs28929474).\n\n== Biochemical properties ==\nA1AT is a single-chain glycoprotein consisting of 394 amino acids in the mature form and exhibits many [[glycoform]]s. The three N-linked glycosylations sites are mainly equipped with so-called diantennary N-[[glycans]]. However, one particular site shows a considerable amount of heterogeneity since tri- and even tetraantennary N-[[glycans]] can be attached to the [[Asparagine]] 107 ([[UniProtKB]] amino acid nomenclature). These [[glycans]] carry different amounts of negatively charged sialic acids; this causes the heterogeneity observed on normal A1AT when analysed by [[isoelectric focusing]]. Also, the fucosylated triantennary N-glycans were shown to have the [[fucose]] as part of a so-called [[Sialyl Lewis x]] [[epitope]], which could confer this [[protein]] particular protein-cell recognition properties. The single [[cysteine]] residue of A1AT in position 256 ([[UniProtKB]] nomenclature) is found to be covalently linked to a free single [[cysteine]] by a [[disulfide bridge]].<ref name=Kolarich_2006>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kolarich D, Weber A, Turecek PL, Schwarz HP, Altmann F | title = Comprehensive glyco-proteomic analysis of human alpha1-antitrypsin and its charge isoforms | journal = Proteomics | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 3369\u201380 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16622833 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200500751 }}</ref>\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe level of A1AT in serum is most often determined by adding an antibody that binds to A1AT, then using [[turbidimetry]] to measure how much A1AT is present. Other detection methods include the use of enzyme-linked-immuno-sorbent-assays and radial immunodiffusion.\n\nDifferent analytical methods are used to determine A1AT [[phenotype]]. As [[protein]] [[electrophoresis]] is imprecise, the A1AT phenotype is analysed by [[isoelectric focusing]] (IEF) in the pH range 4.5-5.5, where the protein migrates in a gel according to its isoelectric point or charge in a [[pH]] gradient.\n\nNormal A1AT is termed ''M'', as it migrates toward the center of such an IEF gel. Other variants are less functional and are termed A-L and N-Z, dependent on whether they run proximal or distal to the M band. The presence of deviant bands on IEF can signify the presence of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency|alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]].  Since the number of identified mutations has exceeded the number of letters in the alphabet, subscripts have been added to most recent discoveries in this area, as in the Pittsburgh mutation described above.\n\nAs every person has two [[allele|copies]] of the A1AT [[gene]], a [[heterozygote]] with two different copies of the gene may have two different bands showing on electrofocusing, although heterozygote with one null mutant that abolishes expression of the gene will only show one band.\n\nIn [[blood test]] results, the IEF results are notated as in ''P<sub>i</sub>''MM, where ''P<sub>i</sub>'' stands for [[protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitor]] and \"MM\" is the banding pattern of that patient.\n\n''Alpha-1 antitrypsin'' levels in the blood depend on the [[genotype]]. Some mutant forms fail to fold properly and are, thus, targeted for destruction in the [[proteasome]], whereas others have a tendency to [[polymer]]ise, being retained in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. The serum levels of some of the common genotypes are:\n\n* PiMM: 100% (normal)\n* PiMS: 80% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiSS: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiMZ: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiSZ: 40% of normal serum level of A1AT\n* PiZZ: 10-15% (severe [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency|alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]])\n* PiZ is caused by a [[glutamate]] to [[lysine]] mutation at position 342 (366 in pre-processed form)\n* PiS is caused by a [[glutamate]] to [[valine]] mutation at position 264 (288 in pre-processed form)\nOther rarer forms have been described; in all, there are over 80 variants.\n\n== Medical use ==\n{{drugbox\n| verifiedrevid = 477318673\n| IUPAC_name = Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor\n| image = A1AT.png\n<!--Clinical data -->\n| pregnancy_category = \n| legal_status = \n| routes_of_administration = intravenous\n<!--Pharmacokinetic data -->\n| bioavailability = \n| protein_bound = \n| metabolism = \n| elimination_half-life = \n<!--Identifiers -->\n| CAS_number_Ref = {{cascite|correct|??}}\n| CAS_number = 9041-92-3\n| ATC_prefix = B02\n| ATC_suffix = AB02\n| ATC_supplemental = \n| ChemSpiderID_Ref = {{chemspidercite|correct|chemspider}}\n| ChemSpiderID = none\n| PubChem = \n| DrugBank_Ref = {{drugbankcite|correct|drugbank}}\n| DrugBank = DB00058\n<!--Chemical data -->\n| C=2001 | H=3130 | N=514 | O=601 | S=10\n| molecular_weight = 44324.5 g/mol\n}}\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin concentrates are prepared from the [[blood plasma]] of blood donors.

Eight of his photo studies made between 1997 and 2003 were assembled and published as chapters in a book called ''Field Studies'' in 2004, which also toured as an exhibition.\n\nIn January 2003 Gill bought a Bakelite 1960s [[box camera]] made by [[Coronet Camera Company|Coronet]] for 50 pence at Hackney Wick Sunday market, near where he lived. The camera had a plastic lens, and it lacked focus and exposure controls.\n\nOver the next four years he had used the camera to photograph within the extremely varied environment of Hackney Wick, including waterways and allotments; and to make portraits of people at the Sunday market and who lived and worked in the area.\n\nThe subject parameters to this long-term obsession were geographical rather than conceptual.\n\nThe lack of image clarity that the plastic camera offered aligned very much with Gill's frame of mind at the time. As such images seemed to deny information, but somehow managed to retain a heightened sense of place and allow the images to breath without forcing a point.\n\nIt was later announced that the area Gill had been extensively photographing would be redeveloped for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].\n\nGill claims that this finished body of work was steered, informed and shaped by the place itself. And his approach to making the work was more reacting, responding and being carried by the subject rather than seeking out ideas that were already formed in the mind.\n\nGill described this period of working as walking away from photography or almost starting again, putting content first and technique second whilst aiming to also work with photography\u2019s weaknesses rather than its descriptive strengths.\n\nHaving been attempting to take steps backwards and thus encouraging an element of chance to play a part in the image making, Gill hoped it allowed the subjects to unfold and not be suffocated by the technical parameters that the medium so often imposes.\n\nGill did not want to undermine photography\u2019s strengths, however there was a new understanding that straight descriptive photography was not always able to grasp and convey all ideas.\n\nIn the 2005 series ''Buried,'' he made photographs in Hackney Wick and took the C-type prints back to the area and buried them in the ground. The prints were left up to seven to ten days with the hope that the place itself would leave its mark and the spirit of the place would be felt in the final work. He saw this as collaboration with place.\n\nAn obsession with this part of London lasted over ten years and led to many different series including \u2013 ''Hackney Wick,'' ''Archaeology in Reverse,'' ''Warming Down,'' ''Buried,'' ''Off Ground,'' ''A Series of Disappointments,'' ''Talking to Ants'' and ''Best Before End.'' Gill felt that such local concerns had international significance.\n\nIn his later work, Gill has grappled with series that try to extract from, as well as describe the subject matter. With ''Talking to Ants,'' he took small found objects and creatures and put them in the film chamber of a camera prior to loading the film. This resulted in \"in-camera photograms\", which attempting to \"evoke the spirit of a place and where intentions meet chance\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lensculture.com/articles/stephen-gill-outside-in|title=Outside In - Photographs and text by Stephen Gill {{!}} LensCulture|last=LensCulture|first=Stephen Gill {{!}}|work=LensCulture|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n\n''Best Before End'' looks at the phenomenon of energy drink consumption. This time rather than describing the subject, Gill used the drinks as an aid to make the finished images as the negatives partly processed in energy drinks of different kinds. It allowed the drinks to shift and alter the images with a small amount of manual intervention.\n\n== Early life ==\nGill was born in 1971 in [[Bristol]], UK. He became interested in photography in his early childhood, thanks to his father and Stephen's growing interest in birds, insects and initial obsession with collecting bits of pond life to inspect under his microscope. In 1982 Gill's father, a keen photographer, taught him to process film and print his own pictures in their attic darkroom. In 1985, while still at school, he worked for a local, Bristol-based photography company, copying and restoring old photographs; and helping to make family portraits. Between 1988 and 1991 after leaving school, he worked in an one-hour Photo Lab in Bedminster Bristol. In 1992, he enrolled in the photography foundation course at [[South Gloucestershire and Stroud College|Filton College]] in Bristol. In 1994, Gill moved from Bristol to London where he worked at the Magnum Photos agency as a member of staff in the archive, assisting photographers and processing black and white films, first as an intern and then in 1995 full-time. In 1997, he left Magnum to work full-time on his own projects. He lived and worked in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], East London, until 2014. In March 2014, he set up a studio in South Sweden where he now lives with his family.\n\n==Books==\nBooks are a key aspect to Gill's practice. He founded his own publishing imprint, Nobody Books, in 2005,  \"to exercise maximum control over the publication process of his books\" and \"to make the book a finished expression of the photographs, rather than just a shell to house them in\". Most books were produced using offset printing, though he often experiments with a hands-on, tactile approach, including materials and techniques such as lino cut printing, letter press printing, mono prints, spray paint and rubber stamps. On occasion, entire books are manufactured and assembled in his studio<sup>[9]</sup> by himself and his assistant Richard, who also distribute the books. His books have received wide international acclaim. Critic [[Sean O'Hagan (journalist)|Sean O'Hagan]], writing in ''The Guardian'' in 2010, said \"In Britain, Stephen Gill is perhaps the best-known contemporary self-published photographer\".  In 2011, PHotoEspa\u00f1a awarded Stephen Gill\u2019s imprint Nobody \"Outstanding Publishing House of the Year\" award.\n\n===Books by Gill===\n*''A Book of Field Studies.''

His photo-accumulations demonstrate a tender vision factored out of experience; alert, watchful, not overeager, wary of that mendacious conceit, \u2018closure\u2019. There is always flow, momentum, the sense of a man passing through a place that delights him. A sense of stepping down, immediate engagement, politic exchange. Then he remounts the bicycle and away. Loving retrievals, like a letter to a friend, never possession\u2026 What I like about Stephen Gill is that he has learnt to give us only as much as we need, the bones of the bones of the bones\u2026</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Martin Parr]] (writing in 2004):\n\n<blockquote>Stephen Gill is emerging as a major force in British photography. His best work is a hybrid between documentary and conceptual work and for this international it is the repeated exploration of one idea, executed with the precision that makes these series so fascinating and illuminating. Gill brings a very British, understated irony into portrait and landscape photography.<ref name=\"schusev\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716085021/http://www.muar.ru/eng/exhibitions/2004/exibit060904_e.htm Announcement of \"Field Studies\" exhibition] at the Schusev State Museum of Architecture, 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Jon Ronson]], writing in 2004 about ''Field Studies'', was reminded of the [[Observer's Books]]:\n<blockquote>Stephen's photos have all the naive gusto of the Observer series of old [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.] Mercifully lacking in malevolence, they are also wise and modern and beautifully laden with tiny, understated details about the way we live today. [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.] When you look at a Martin Parr photograph, everything about it says, instantly, Martin Parr. Stephen's photographs, however, are so subtle, so seemingly un-authored, it's only when you stare at them en masse and one after the other, you realise that they can only have been taken by Stephen Gill. There is a tremendous, quiet, respectful, cumulative power to his work.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/may/15/photography|title=Attention to detail|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=15 May 2004|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|www.stephengill.co.uk}}\n* [https://christopheguye.com/artists/stephen-gill/selected-works Gallery] at Christophe Guye Galerie\n* [http://nobodybooks.com Nobody Books]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/15/stephen-gill-energy-drinks-red-bull-will-self About Best Before End, Will Self: my energy-drink addiction, at The Guardian]\n* [http://www.americansuburbx.com/2013/06/stephen-gill-best-before-end-2013.html Review: Stephen Gill\u2019s \u201cBest Before End\u201d at FOAM]\n* [https://www.ft.com/content/e2a47f78-e8f9-11e2-aead-00144feabdc0 Review of Pigeons at The Financial Times]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvrKjrPeWU4 Video of Best Before End at Foam]\n* [http://time.com/62087/coexistence-by-stephen-gill/#1 Review of Coexistence at ''Time'']\n* [https://themorningnews.org/gallery/the-world-inside-a-camera Interview about Outside In at The Morning News]\n* [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/photography/7813330/Photographer-Stephen-Gill-the-devil-in-the-detail.html About Coming Up For Air at The Telegraph]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/04/self-publish-photographers-photobooks Self-publish or be damned: why photographers are going it alone at The Guardian]\n* [https://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk/2009/06/06/the-wicker-man/ About Hackney Wick at Hackney Citizen]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/08/photography Review of Archaeology in Reverse at The Guardian]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/mar/18/communities.weekendmagazine Review of Hackney Wick at The Guardian]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/jan/15/photography About Invisible at The Guardian]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gill, Stephen}}\n[[Category:1971 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:British photographers]]\n[[Category:People from Bristol]]\n[[Category:Royal Photographic Society]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n[[File:Stephen Gill (Bristol Photobook Festival, 2014).jpg|thumb|right|Stephen Gill, 2014]]\n'''Stephen Gill''' (born 1971) is a British experimental, [[Conceptual photography|conceptual]] and [[Documentary photography|documentary photographer]]. Books are a key aspect to Gill's practice.\n\n== Photographic practice ==\n\nGill is a British photographer, who mainly draws inspiration from his immediate surroundings of inner city life in East London and more recently Sweden with an attempt to make work that reflects, responds and describes the times we live in.\n\nHis work is often made up of long-term photo studies exploring and responding to the subjects in great depth.\n\nAfter working mainly in black and white from 1984, his practice since the mid 1990s was mostly in colour.\n\nUntil 2003 his work mostly had a descriptive and typographical approach towards the subjects. Eight of his photo studies made between 1997 and 2003 were assembled and published as chapters in a book called ''Field Studies'' in 2004, which also toured as an exhibition.\n\nIn January 2003 Gill bought a Bakelite 1960s [[box camera]] made by [[Coronet Camera Company|Coronet]] for 50 pence at Hackney Wick Sunday market, near where he lived. The camera had a plastic lens, and it lacked focus and exposure controls.\n\nOver the next four years he had used the camera to photograph within the extremely varied environment of Hackney Wick, including waterways and allotments; and to make portraits of people at the Sunday market and who lived and worked in the area.\n\nThe subject parameters to this long-term obsession were geographical rather than conceptual.\n\nThe lack of image clarity that the plastic camera offered aligned very much with Gill's frame of mind at the time. As such images seemed to deny information, but somehow managed to retain a heightened sense of place and allow the images to breath without forcing a point.\n\nIt was later announced that the area Gill had been extensively photographing would be redeveloped for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].\n\nGill claims that this finished body of work was steered, informed and shaped by the place itself. And his approach to making the work was more reacting, responding and being carried by the subject rather than seeking out ideas that were already formed in the mind.\n\nGill described this period of working as walking away from photography or almost starting again, putting content first and technique second whilst aiming to also work with photography\u2019s weaknesses rather than its descriptive strengths.\n\nHaving been attempting to take steps backwards and thus encouraging an element of chance to play a part in the image making, Gill hoped it allowed the subjects to unfold and not be suffocated by the technical parameters that the medium so often imposes.\n\nGill did not want to undermine photography\u2019s strengths, however there was a new understanding that straight descriptive photography was not always able to grasp and convey all ideas.\n\nIn the 2005 series ''Buried,'' he made photographs in Hackney Wick and took the C-type prints back to the area and buried them in the ground. The prints were left up to seven to ten days with the hope that the place itself would leave its mark and the spirit of the place would be felt in the final work. He saw this as collaboration with place.\n\nAn obsession with this part of London lasted over ten years and led to many different series including \u2013 ''Hackney Wick,'' ''Archaeology in Reverse,'' ''Warming Down,'' ''Buried,'' ''Off Ground,'' ''A Series of Disappointments,'' ''Talking to Ants'' and ''Best Before End.'' Gill felt that such local concerns had international significance.\n\nIn his later work, Gill has grappled with series that try to extract from, as well as describe the subject matter. With ''Talking to Ants,'' he took small found objects and creatures and put them in the film chamber of a camera prior to loading the film. This resulted in \"in-camera photograms\", which attempting to \"evoke the spirit of a place and where intentions meet chance\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lensculture.com/articles/stephen-gill-outside-in|title=Outside In - Photographs and text by Stephen Gill {{!}} LensCulture|last=LensCulture|first=Stephen Gill {{!}}|work=LensCulture|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n\n''Best Before End'' looks at the phenomenon of energy drink consumption. This time rather than describing the subject, Gill used the drinks as an aid to make the finished images as the negatives partly processed in energy drinks of different kinds. It allowed the drinks to shift and alter the images with a small amount of manual intervention.\n\n== Early life ==\nGill was born in 1971 in [[Bristol]], UK. He became interested in photography in his early childhood, thanks to his father and Stephen's growing interest in birds, insects and initial obsession with collecting bits of pond life to inspect under his microscope. In 1982 Gill's father, a keen photographer, taught him to process film and print his own pictures in their attic darkroom. In 1985, while still at school, he worked for a local, Bristol-based photography company, copying and restoring old photographs; and helping to make family portraits. Between 1988 and 1991 after leaving school, he worked in an one-hour Photo Lab in Bedminster Bristol. In 1992, he enrolled in the photography foundation course at [[South Gloucestershire and Stroud College|Filton College]] in Bristol. In 1994, Gill moved from Bristol to London where he worked at the Magnum Photos agency as a member of staff in the archive, assisting photographers and processing black and white films, first as an intern and then in 1995 full-time. In 1997, he left Magnum to work full-time on his own projects. He lived and worked in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], East London, until 2014. In March 2014, he set up a studio in South Sweden where he now lives with his family.\n\n==Books==\nBooks are a key aspect to Gill's practice. He founded his own publishing imprint, Nobody Books, in 2005,  \"to exercise maximum control over the publication process of his books\" and \"to make the book a finished expression of the photographs, rather than just a shell to house them in\". Most books were produced using offset printing, though he often experiments with a hands-on, tactile approach, including materials and techniques such as lino cut printing, letter press printing, mono prints, spray paint and rubber stamps. On occasion, entire books are manufactured and assembled in his studio<sup>[9]</sup> by himself and his assistant Richard, who also distribute the books. His books have received wide international acclaim. Critic [[Sean O'Hagan (journalist)|Sean O'Hagan]], writing in ''The Guardian'' in 2010, said \"In Britain, Stephen Gill is perhaps the best-known contemporary self-published photographer\".  In 2011, PHotoEspa\u00f1a awarded Stephen Gill\u2019s imprint Nobody \"Outstanding Publishing House of the Year\" award.\n\n===Books by Gill===\n*''A Book of Field Studies.''

His photo-accumulations demonstrate a tender vision factored out of experience; alert, watchful, not overeager, wary of that mendacious conceit, \u2018closure\u2019. There is always flow, momentum, the sense of a man passing through a place that delights him. A sense of stepping down, immediate engagement, politic exchange. Then he remounts the bicycle and away. Loving retrievals, like a letter to a friend, never possession\u2026 What I like about Stephen Gill is that he has learnt to give us only as much as we need, the bones of the bones of the bones\u2026</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Martin Parr]] (writing in 2004):\n\n<blockquote>Stephen Gill is emerging as a major force in British photography. His best work is a hybrid between documentary and conceptual work and for this international it is the repeated exploration of one idea, executed with the precision that makes these series so fascinating and illuminating. Gill brings a very British, understated irony into portrait and landscape photography.<ref name=\"schusev\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716085021/http://www.muar.ru/eng/exhibitions/2004/exibit060904_e.htm Announcement of \"Field Studies\" exhibition] at the Schusev State Museum of Architecture, 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Jon Ronson]], writing in 2004 about ''Field Studies'', was reminded of the [[Observer's Books]]:\n<blockquote>Stephen's photos have all the naive gusto of the Observer series of old [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.] Mercifully lacking in malevolence, they are also wise and modern and beautifully laden with tiny, understated details about the way we live today. [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.] When you look at a Martin Parr photograph, everything about it says, instantly, Martin Parr. Stephen's photographs, however, are so subtle, so seemingly un-authored, it's only when you stare at them en masse and one after the other, you realise that they can only have been taken by Stephen Gill. There is a tremendous, quiet, respectful, cumulative power to his work.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/may/15/photography|title=Attention to detail|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=15 May 2004|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|www.stephengill.co.uk}}\n* [https://christopheguye.com/artists/stephen-gill/selected-works Gallery] at Christophe Guye Galerie\n* [http://nobodybooks.com Nobody Books]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/15/stephen-gill-energy-drinks-red-bull-will-self About Best Before End, Will Self: my energy-drink addiction, at The Guardian]\n* [http://www.americansuburbx.com/2013/06/stephen-gill-best-before-end-2013.html Review: Stephen Gill\u2019s \u201cBest Before End\u201d at FOAM]\n* [https://www.ft.com/content/e2a47f78-e8f9-11e2-aead-00144feabdc0 Review of Pigeons at The Financial Times]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvrKjrPeWU4 Video of Best Before End at Foam]\n* [http://time.com/62087/coexistence-by-stephen-gill/#1 Review of Coexistence at ''Time'']\n* [https://themorningnews.org/gallery/the-world-inside-a-camera Interview about Outside In at The Morning News]\n* [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/photography/7813330/Photographer-Stephen-Gill-the-devil-in-the-detail.html About Coming Up For Air at The Telegraph]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/04/self-publish-photographers-photobooks Self-publish or be damned: why photographers are going it alone at The Guardian]\n* [https://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk/2009/06/06/the-wicker-man/ About Hackney Wick at Hackney Citizen]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/08/photography Review of Archaeology in Reverse at The Guardian]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/mar/18/communities.weekendmagazine Review of Hackney Wick at The Guardian]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/jan/15/photography About Invisible at The Guardian]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gill, Stephen}}\n[[Category:1971 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:British photographers]]\n[[Category:People from Bristol]]\n[[Category:Royal Photographic Society]]\n", "name_user": "Nighttyme1", "label": "safe", "comment": "introduction to Stephen Gill's practice", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Gill_(photographer)"}

He is widely considered one of the most important and influential [[20th-century classical music|composers of the 20th century]].\n\nStravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the [[impresario]] [[Serge Diaghilev]] and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]: ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1910), ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911), and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913). The latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His \"Russian phase\", which continued with works such as ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'', ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' and ''[[Les Noces]]'', was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ([[concerto grosso]], [[fugue]] and [[symphony]]) and drew from earlier styles, especially those of the 18th century. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted [[serialism|serial]] procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note [[Cell (music)|cells]] and clarity of [[Musical form|form]], and of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life, 1882\u20131901===\nStravinsky was born on 17 June 1882 in the town of [[Lomonosov, Russia|Oranienbaum]] on the southern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], situated 25 miles west of [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Greene|1985|p=1101}}{{sfn|White|1979|p=4}} His father, [[Fyodor Stravinsky|Fyodor Ignatievich Stravinsky]] (1843\u20131902), was an established [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] opera singer in the [[National Opera of Ukraine|Kiev Opera House]] and the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg and his mother, Anna Kirillovna Stravinskaya (''n\u00e9e'' Kholodovskaya; 1854\u20131939), a native of [[Kiev]], was one of four daughters of a high-ranking official in the Kiev Ministry of Estates.

The original family surname was Soulima-Stravinsky; the name \"Stravinsky\" originated from the word \"Strava\", one of the variants of the [[Str\u0117va|Streva River]] in [[Lithuania]].{{sfn|Pisalnik|2012}}{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1960|p=6, 17}}\n\n[[File:Ustylug Vol-Volynskyi Volynska-Stravinskyi house after reconstruction in 2013-left view.jpg|alt=house of Igor Stravinsky|thumb|left|Stravinsky's house in [[Ustilug]], now a museum]]\nOn 10 August 1882, Stravinsky was baptised at [[St. Nicholas Naval Cathedral|Nikolsky Cathedral]] in Saint Petersburg.<ref name=NYT99/> Until 1914, he spent most of his summers in the town of [[Ustyluh|Ustilug]], now in [[Ukraine]], where his father-in-law owned an estate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Igor Stravinsky public museum in Ustyluh|url=http://volyn-museum.com.ua/index/ustiluzkij_narodnij_muzej_igorja_stravinskogo/0-35|website=Museums of the Volyn}}</ref>{{sfn|White|1979|p=5}} Stravinsky's first school was [[The Second Saint Petersburg Gymnasium]], where he stayed until his mid-teens. Then he moved to Gourevitch Gymnasium, a private school, where he studied history, mathematics, and six languages.{{sfn|White|1979|p=4, 5}} Stravinsky expressed his general distaste for schooling and recalled being a lonely pupil: \"I never came across anyone who had any real attraction for me\".{{sfn|Stravinsky|1962|p=8}} \n\nStravinsky took to music at an early age and began regular piano lessons at age nine, followed by tuition in music theory and composition.{{sfn|White|1979|p=6, 7}} At around eight years old, he attended a performance of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' at the Mariinsky Theatre, which began a lifelong interest in ballets and the composer himself. By age fifteen, Stravinsky had mastered [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] and finished a piano reduction of a string quartet by [[Alexander Glazunov]], who reportedly considered Stravinsky unmusical and thought little of his skills.{{sfn|Dubal|2001|p=564}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Pupil of Rimsky-Korsakov and first compositions, 1901\u20131909===\n[[File:Stravinsky Igor Postcard-1910.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Stravinsky in 1903]]\nDespite Stravinsky's enthusiasm and ability in music, his parents expected him to study law and at first, took to the subject. In 1901, he enrolled at the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] studying criminal law and legal philosophy, but attendance at lectures was optional and he estimated that he turned up to fewer than fifty in his four years of study.{{sfn|Dubal|2001|p=565}} In the summer of 1902, Stravinsky stayed with composer and orchestrator [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and his family in [[Heidelberg]], Germany, after he had met Vladimir, the youngest son of Rimsky-Korsakov and a fellow pupil at the University of Saint Petersburg, and wished to meet his father about his musical aspirations. Rimsky-Korsakov, arguably the leading Russian composer at this time, suggested to Stravinsky that he should not enter the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] but continue private lessons in theory.{{sfn|White|1979|p=8}}\n\nBy the time of his father's death from cancer in 1902, Stravinsky was spending more time studying music than law.{{sfn|Palmer|1982}} His decision to pursue music full time was helped when the university was closed for two months in 1905 in the aftermath of [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], which prevented him from taking his final law exams. In April 1906, Stravinsky received a half-course diploma and concentrated on music thereafter.{{sfn|Walsh|2001}}{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=83}} In 1905, he started twice-weekly lessons from Rimsky-Korsakov and regarded him as a second father.{{sfn|Dubal|2001|p=565}} These lessons continued until Rimsky-Korsakov's death in 1908.{{sfn|Stravinsky|1962|p=24}} Stravinsky completed his first composition during this time, the [[Symphony in E-flat (Stravinsky)|Symphony in E-flat]], catalogued as Opus 1. In the wake of Rimsky-Korsakov's death, Stravinsky composed ''[[Funeral Song (Stravinsky)|Funeral Song]]'', Op. 5 which was performed once and then considered lost until its discovery in 2015.\n\nIn August 1905, Stravinsky became engaged to his first cousin, Katherine Gavrylivna Nosenko.{{sfn|White|1979|p=5}} In spite of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]'s opposition to marriage between first cousins, the couple married on 23 January 1906. They lived in the family's residence at 66 Kryukov Cannal in Saint Petersburg before they moved into a new home in Ustilug, which Stravinsky designed and built, and which he later called his \"heavenly place\".

In February of that year, both were performed in Saint Petersburg at a concert that marked a turning point in Stravinsky's career. In the audience was [[Serge Diaghilev]], a Russian impresario and owner of the [[Ballets Russes]] who was struck with Stravinsky's compositions. He wished to stage a mix of Russian opera and ballet for the 1910 season in Paris, among them a new ballet from fresh talent that was based on the Russian fairytale of the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]].{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} After [[Anatoly Liadov]] was given the task of composing the score, he informed Diaghilev that he needed about one year to complete it.{{sfn|White|1979|p=16}} Diaghilev then asked the 28-year-old Stravinsky, who had provided satisfactory orchestrations for him for the previous season at short notice and agreed to compose a full score.{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} At 50 minutes in length, ''[[The Firebird]]'' was revised by Stravinsky for concert performance in 1911, 1919, and 1945.\n\n''The Firebird'' premiered at the [[Palais Garnier|Opera de Paris]] on 25 June 1910 to widespread critical acclaim and Stravinsky became an overnight sensation.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|pp=142\u201343}}{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=140}}{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=30}} As his wife was expecting their third child, the Stravinskys spent the summer in [[La Baule-Escoublac|La Baule]] in western France. In September, they moved to [[Clarens, Switzerland|Clarens]], Switzerland where their second son, [[Soulima Stravinsky|Sviatoslav]] (Soulima), was born.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=145}} The family would spend their summers in Russia and winters in Switzerland until 1914.{{sfn|White|1979|p=33}} Diaghilev commissioned Stravinsky to score a second ballet for the 1911 Paris season. The result was ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', based the Russian folk tale featuring the [[Petrushka|titular character]], a puppet, who falls in love with another, a ballerina. Though it failed to capture the immediate reception that ''The Firebird'' had following its premiere at [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in June 1911, the production continued Stravinsky's success.\n\nIt was Stravinsky's third ballet for Diaghilev, ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', that caused a sensation among critics, fellow composers, and concertgoers. Based on an original idea, the production features a series of primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. Stravinsky's score contained many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. The radical nature of the music and choreography caused a near-riot at its premiere at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 29 May 1913.\n\nShortly after the premiere, Stravinsky contracted [[typhoid]] from eating bad oysters and he was confined to a Paris nursing home. He left in July 1913 and returned to Ustilug.{{sfn|V. Stravinsky and Craft|1978|pp=100, 102}} For the rest of the summer he focused on his first opera, ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' (''Le Rossignol''), based on the [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|same-titled story]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], which he had started in 1908.{{sfn|V. Stravinsky and Craft|1978|pp=111\u201314}} On 15 January 1914, Stravinsky and Nosenko had their fourth child, Marie Mil\u00e8ne (or Maria Milena). After her delivery, Nosenko was discovered to have [[tuberculosis]] and was confined to a [[sanatorium]] in [[Leysin]] in the Alps. Stravinsky took up residence nearby, where he completed ''The Nightingale''.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=224}}{{sfn|V.

He was drawn to the growing cultural life of Los Angeles, especially during World War II, when so many writers, musicians, composers and conductors settled in the area: these included [[Otto Klemperer]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[George Balanchine]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]]. [[Bernard Holland]] claimed Stravinsky was especially fond of British writers, who visited him in Beverly Hills, \"like [[W. H. Auden]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], [[Dylan Thomas]].

This is where notes are subtracted or added to a motif without regard to the consequent changes in metre. A similar technique can be found as early as the 16th century, for example in the music of [[Cipriano de Rore]], [[Orlande de Lassus|Orlandus Lassus]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]] and [[Giovanni de Macque]], music with which Stravinsky exhibited considerable familiarity.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1960|pp=116\u201317}}\n\nThe ''Rite of Spring'' is notable for its relentless use of [[ostinato|ostinati]], for example in the eighth-note ostinato on strings accented by eight [[French horn|horns]] in the section \"Augurs of Spring (Dances of the Young Girls)\".

In 1923, [[Erik Satie]] wrote an article about Igor Stravinsky in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.{{sfn|Satie|1923}} Satie had met Stravinsky for the first time in 1910. In the published article, Satie argued that measuring the \"greatness\" of an artist by comparing him to other artists, as if speaking about some \"truth\", is illusory and that every piece of music should be judged on its own merits and not by comparing it to the standards of other composers. That was exactly what [[Jean Cocteau]] did when he commented deprecatingly on Stravinsky in his 1918 book, {{lang|fr|Le Coq et l'Arlequin}}.{{sfn|Volta|1989|loc=first pages of chapter on contemporaries}}{{Page needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAccording to ''[[The Musical Times]]'' in 1923:\n<blockquote>All the signs indicate a strong reaction against the nightmare of noise and eccentricity that was one of the legacies of the war.... What (for example) has become of the works that made up the program of the Stravinsky concert which created such a stir a few years ago? Practically the whole lot are already on the shelf, and they will remain there until a few jaded neurotics once more feel a desire to eat ashes and fill their belly with the east wind.<ref>\"Occasional Notes\", ''[[The Musical Times and Singing-Class Circular]]'' 64, no. 968 (1 October 1923): 712\u201315, quotation on 713.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:RIAN archive 597702 Composer Igor Stravinsky and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.jpg|thumb|upright|Stravinsky with [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] in Moscow in September 1962]]\nIn 1935, the American composer [[Marc Blitzstein]] compared Stravinsky to [[Jacopo Peri]] and [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E. Bach]], conceding that, \"there is no denying the greatness of Stravinsky. It is just that he is not great enough\".{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|p=330}} Blitzstein's [[Marxism|Marxist]] position was that Stravinsky's wish to \"divorce music from other streams of life\", which is \"symptomatic of an escape from reality\", resulted in a \"loss of stamina\", naming specifically ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'', the [[Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra|Capriccio]], and ''[[Le baiser de la f\u00e9e|Le Baiser de la f\u00e9e]]''.{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|pp=346\u201347}}\n\nThe composer [[Constant Lambert]] described pieces such as ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' as containing \"essentially cold-blooded abstraction\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|p=94}} Lambert continued, \"melodic fragments in {{lang|fr|Histoire du Soldat}} are completely meaningless themselves. They are merely successions of notes that can conveniently be divided into groups of three, five, and seven and set against other mathematical groups\" and he described the cadenza for solo drums as \"musical purity ... achieved by a species of musical castration\". He compared Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" to [[Gertrude Stein]]'s 'Everyday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday' (\"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\", 1922), \"whose effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|pp=101\u201305}}\n\nIn his 1949 book ''Philosophy of Modern Music'', [[Theodor W. Adorno]] described Stravinsky as an acrobat and spoke of [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] and psychotic traits in several of Stravinsky's works. Contrary to a common misconception, Adorno didn't believe the hebephrenic and psychotic imitations that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault, as he pointed out in a postscript that he added later to his book. Adorno's criticism of Stravinsky is more concerned with the \"transition to positivity\" Adorno found in his neoclassical works.{{sfn|Adorno|2006|p=167}} Part of the composer's error, in Adorno's view, was his neoclassicism,{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=206\u201309}} but of greater importance was his music's \"pseudomorphism of painting\", playing off {{lang|fr|le temps espace}} (time-space) rather than {{lang|fr|le temps dur\u00e9e}} (time-duration) of [[Henri Bergson]].{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=191\u201393}} According to Adorno, \"one trick characterizes all of Stravinsky's formal endeavors: the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus tableau and to present time complexes as though they were spatial. This trick, however, soon exhausts itself\".{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=195}} Adorno maintained that the \"rhythmic procedures closely resemble the schema of catatonic conditions. In certain schizophrenics, the process by which the motor apparatus becomes independent leads to infinite repetition of gestures or words, following the decay of the ego\".{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=178}}\n\nStravinsky's reputation in Russia and the USSR rose and fell. Performances of his music were banned from around 1933 until 1962, the year [[Nikita Khrushchev]] invited him to the USSR for an official state visit. In 1972, an official proclamation by the Soviet Minister of Culture, [[Yekaterina Furtseva]], ordered Soviet musicians to \"study and admire\" Stravinsky's music and she made hostility toward it a potential offence.{{specify |reason=what type of offence? |date=November 2017}}{{sfn|Karlinsky|1985|p=282}}<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/tempo/article/books/9671C20C4B0030BEAAFA07BDCD28BE84|title=Books -|journal=Tempo|issue=118|pages=39\u201340|accessdate=25 November 2017|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S004029820002845X|year=1976}}</ref>\n<!--During his lifetime, Stravinsky was often criticized for the apparently abrupt changes in style from one work to another.

He is widely considered one of the most important and influential [[20th-century classical music|composers of the 20th century]].\n\nStravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the [[impresario]] [[Serge Diaghilev]] and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]: ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1910), ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911), and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913). The latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His \"Russian phase\", which continued with works such as ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'', ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' and ''[[Les Noces]]'', was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ([[concerto grosso]], [[fugue]] and [[symphony]]) and drew from earlier styles, especially those of the 18th century. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted [[serialism|serial]] procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note [[Cell (music)|cells]] and clarity of [[Musical form|form]], and of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life, 1882\u20131901===\nStravinsky was born on 17 June 1882 in the town of [[Lomonosov, Russia|Oranienbaum]] on the southern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], situated 25 miles west of [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Greene|1985|p=1101}}{{sfn|White|1979|p=4}} His father, [[Fyodor Stravinsky|Fyodor Ignatievich Stravinsky]] (1843\u20131902), was an established [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] opera singer in the [[National Opera of Ukraine|Kiev Opera House]] and the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg and his mother, Anna Kirillovna Stravinskaya (''n\u00e9e'' Kholodovskaya; 1854\u20131939), a native of [[Kiev]], was one of four daughters of a high-ranking official in the Kiev Ministry of Estates.

In February of that year, both were performed in Saint Petersburg at a concert that marked a turning point in Stravinsky's career. In the audience was [[Serge Diaghilev]], a Russian impresario and owner of the [[Ballets Russes]] who was struck with Stravinsky's compositions. He wished to stage a mix of Russian opera and ballet for the 1910 season in Paris, among them a new ballet from fresh talent that was based on the Russian fairytale of the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]].{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} After [[Anatoly Liadov]] was given the task of composing the score, he informed Diaghilev that he needed about one year to complete it.{{sfn|White|1979|p=16}} Diaghilev then asked the 28-year-old Stravinsky, who had provided satisfactory orchestrations for him for the previous season at short notice and agreed to compose a full score.{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} At 50 minutes in length, ''[[The Firebird]]'' was revised by Stravinsky for concert performance in 1911, 1919, and 1945.\n\n''The Firebird'' premiered at the [[Palais Garnier|Opera de Paris]] on 25 June 1910 to widespread critical acclaim and Stravinsky became an overnight sensation.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|pp=142\u201343}}{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=140}}{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=30}} As his wife was expecting their third child, the Stravinskys spent the summer in [[La Baule-Escoublac|La Baule]] in western France.

The result was ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', based the Russian folk tale featuring the [[Petrushka|titular character]], a puppet, who falls in love with another, a ballerina. Though it failed to capture the immediate reception that ''The Firebird'' had following its premiere at [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in June 1911, the production continued Stravinsky's success.\n\nIt was Stravinsky's third ballet for Diaghilev, ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', that caused a sensation among critics, fellow composers, and concertgoers. Based on an original idea, the production features a series of primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. Stravinsky's score contained many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. The radical nature of the music and choreography caused a near-riot at its premiere at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 29 May 1913.\n\nShortly after the premiere, Stravinsky contracted [[typhoid]] from eating bad oysters and he was confined to a Paris nursing home. He left in July 1913 and returned to Ustilug.{{sfn|V. Stravinsky and Craft|1978|pp=100, 102}} For the rest of the summer he focused on his first opera, ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' (''Le Rossignol''), based on the [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|same-titled story]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], which he had started in 1908.{{sfn|V. Stravinsky and Craft|1978|pp=111\u201314}} On 15 January 1914, Stravinsky and Nosenko had their fourth child, Marie Mil\u00e8ne (or Maria Milena).

Hogarth's drawings, which told the story of a London man who lost his money and became a drunk, was an idea Stravinsky found attractive as an opera. American poet [[W. H.

The first of his compositions fully based on such techniques was ''In Memoriam Dylan Thomas'' (1954). ''[[Agon (ballet)|Agon]]'' (1954\u201357) was the first of his works to include a twelve-tone series and {{lang|la|[[Canticum Sacrum]]}} (1955) was the first piece to contain a movement entirely based on a [[tone row]]<!-- (\"Surge, aquilo\") -->.{{sfn|Straus|2001|p=4}} Stravinsky expanded his use of dodecaphony in works such as ''[[Threni (Stravinsky)|Threni]]'' (1958) and ''[[A Sermon, a Narrative and a Prayer]]'' (1961), which are based on biblical texts,{{sfn|White|1979|p=510}} and ''[[The Flood (Stravinsky)|The Flood]]'' (1962), which mixes brief biblical texts from the [[Book of Genesis]] with passages from the [[York Mystery Plays|York]] and [[Chester Mystery Plays]].{{sfn|White|1979|p=517}}\n\n==Innovation and influence==\nStravinsky has been called \"one of music's truly epochal innovators\".<ref name=\"AMG\">AMG 2008.

This is where notes are subtracted or added to a motif without regard to the consequent changes in metre. A similar technique can be found as early as the 16th century, for example in the music of [[Cipriano de Rore]], [[Orlande de Lassus|Orlandus Lassus]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]] and [[Giovanni de Macque]], music with which Stravinsky exhibited considerable familiarity.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1960|pp=116\u201317}}\n\nThe ''Rite of Spring'' is notable for its relentless use of [[ostinato|ostinati]], for example in the eighth-note ostinato on strings accented by eight [[French horn|horns]] in the section \"Augurs of Spring (Dances of the Young Girls)\". The work also contains passages where several ostinati clash against one another. Stravinsky was noted for his distinctive use of rhythm, especially in the ''Rite of Spring'' (1913).{{sfn|Simon|2007}} According to the composer [[Philip Glass]], \"the idea of pushing the rhythms across the bar lines [...] led the way [...].

The texts and literary sources for his work began with a period of interest in [[Folklore|Russian folklore]], which progressed to classical authors and the [[Roman Rite|Latin liturgy]] and moved on to contemporary France ([[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], in ''[[Pers\u00e9phone (Stravinsky)|Persephone]]'') and eventually English literature, including [[W.

As a child, he was brought up by his parents in the Russian Orthodox Church. Baptized at birth, he later rebelled against the Church and abandoned it by the time he was fourteen or fifteen years old.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1969|p=198}} Throughout the rise of his career he was estranged from Christianity and it was not until he reached his early forties that he experienced a spiritual crisis. After befriending a Russian Orthodox priest, Father Nicholas, after his move to [[Nice]] in 1924, he reconnected with his faith. He rejoined the Russian Orthodox Church and afterwards remained a committed Christian.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1960|p=51}} Robert Craft noted that Stravinsky prayed daily, before and after composing, and also prayed when facing difficulty.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1966|pp=172\u201375}} Towards the end of his life, he was no longer able to attend church services. In his late seventies, Stravinsky said:<blockquote>I cannot now evaluate the events that, at the end of those thirty years, made me discover the necessity of religious belief. I was not reasoned into my disposition. Though I admire the structured thought of theology ([[St Anselm|Anselm]]'s proof in the ''[[Fides quaerens intellectum|Fides Quaerens Intellectum]]'', for instance) it is to religion no more than counterpoint exercises are to music.

In the published article, Satie argued that measuring the \"greatness\" of an artist by comparing him to other artists, as if speaking about some \"truth\", is illusory and that every piece of music should be judged on its own merits and not by comparing it to the standards of other composers.

They are merely successions of notes that can conveniently be divided into groups of three, five, and seven and set against other mathematical groups\" and he described the cadenza for solo drums as \"musical purity ... achieved by a species of musical castration\". He compared Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" to [[Gertrude Stein]]'s 'Everyday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday' (\"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\", 1922), \"whose effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|pp=101\u201305}}\n\nIn his 1949 book ''Philosophy of Modern Music'', [[Theodor W. Adorno]] described Stravinsky as an acrobat and spoke of [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] and psychotic traits in several of Stravinsky's works. Contrary to a common misconception, Adorno didn't believe the hebephrenic and psychotic imitations that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault, as he pointed out in a postscript that he added later to his book. Adorno's criticism of Stravinsky is more concerned with the \"transition to positivity\" Adorno found in his neoclassical works.{{sfn|Adorno|2006|p=167}} Part of the composer's error, in Adorno's view, was his neoclassicism,{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=206\u201309}} but of greater importance was his music's \"pseudomorphism of painting\", playing off {{lang|fr|le temps espace}} (time-space) rather than {{lang|fr|le temps dur\u00e9e}} (time-duration) of [[Henri Bergson]].{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=191\u201393}} According to Adorno, \"one trick characterizes all of Stravinsky's formal endeavors: the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus tableau and to present time complexes as though they were spatial. This trick, however, soon exhausts itself\".{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=195}} Adorno maintained that the \"rhythmic procedures closely resemble the schema of catatonic conditions.

Although most of his recordings were made with studio musicians, he also worked with the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Cleveland Orchestra]], the [[CBC Symphony Orchestra]], the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the Bavarian Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Stravinsky appeared on several telecasts, including the 1962 world premiere of ''[[The Flood (Stravinsky)|The Flood]]'' on [[CBS Television]]. Although he made an appearance, the actual performance was conducted by Robert Craft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/opera/moreDetails.asp?musicID=7635 |title=Igor Stravinsky \u2013 Flood \u2013 Opera |publisher=Boosey.com |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> Numerous films and videos of the composer have been preserved.\n\nStravinsky published a number of books throughout his career, almost always with the aid of a (sometimes uncredited) collaborator. In his 1936 autobiography, ''Chronicle of My Life'', which was written with the help of [[Walter Nouvel]], Stravinsky included his well-known statement that \"music is, by its very nature, essentially powerless to express anything at all\".{{sfn|Stravinsky|1936|pp=91\u201392}} With [[Alexis Roland-Manuel]] and [[Pyotr Suvchinsky|Pierre Souvtchinsky]], he wrote his 1939\u201340 [[Harvard University]] [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]], which were delivered in French and first collected under the title {{lang|fr|Po\u00e9tique musicale}} in 1942 and then translated in 1947 as ''Poetics of Music''.<ref>The names of uncredited collaborators are given in {{harvnb|Walsh|2001}}.</ref> In 1959, several interviews between the composer and Robert Craft were published as ''Conversations with Igor Stravinsky'',{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1959}} which was followed by a further five volumes over the following decade.

Barnet was once a narrow projection of [[Hertfordshire]] into the county of [[Middlesex]], and consisted of an agricultural market town.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/herts/vol2/pp329-337 'Parishes: Barnet', in A History of the County of Hertford: Volume 2] ed. William Page (London, 1908), pp. 329-337. British History Online. accessed 5 February 2017.</ref>  The town became well connected to central London by the London Underground network and is today prime [[suburbia]], with many of its properties semi-detached with substantial gardens as well as having many small parks and nature reserves.  The area is largely bereft of [[tower block]]s of [[social housing]] original purpose.\n\nIt has been held by a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] since its creation for the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], and withstood the Labour landslide in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] by just over 2% (1,035 votes).  The 2015 result gave the seat the 92nd most marginal majority of the Conservative Party's 331 seats by percentage of majority.<ref>[http://www.ukpolitical.info/conservative-mps-elected-2015.htm List of Conservative MPs elected in 2015 by % majority]  UK Political.info.

Dark green refers to the core Asia-Pacific countries, while light green refers to regions that may be included.]]\n\n'''Asia-Pacific''' or '''Asia Pacific''' is the part of the [[Earth|world]] in or near the Western [[Pacific Ocean]]. Asia-Pacific varies in area depending on context, but it generally includes [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Oceania]]. \n\nThe term may also include parts of [[Russia]] (on the North Pacific) and countries in the [[Americas]] which are on the coast of the Eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]; the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], for example, includes [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Russia]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]] and the [[United States]]. Alternatively, the term sometimes comprises all of [[Asia]] and [[Australasia]] as well as [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] island nations (Asia Pacific and [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]])\u2014for example, when dividing the world into large regions for commercial purposes (e.g., into the [[Americas]], [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] and Asia Pacific).<ref name=\"apec.org\">[http://www.apec.org/about-us/about-apec/member-economies.aspx Member Economies - Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709153701/https://www.apec.org/about-us/about-apec/member-economies.aspx |date=2018-07-09 }}.

Retrieved on 2014-04-12.</ref> [[Western Asia]] is almost never included.<ref name=\"Mordor Intelligence 2019\"/><ref name=\"MarketWatch 2019\"/>\n\nOn the whole, there is no clear-cut definition of \"Asia-Pacific\", and the regions included change depending on the context. The term has become popular since the late 1980s in commerce, finance and politics. Despite the heterogeneity of the regions' economies, most individual nations within the zone are emerging markets experiencing rapid growth.

Asia-Pacific varies in area depending on context, but it generally includes [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Oceania]]. \n\nThe term may also include parts of [[Russia]] (on the North Pacific) and countries in the [[Americas]] which are on the coast of the Eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]; the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], for example, includes [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Russia]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]] and the [[United States]]. Alternatively, the term sometimes comprises all of [[Asia]] and [[Australasia]] as well as [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] island nations (Asia Pacific and [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]])\u2014for example, when dividing the world into large regions for commercial purposes (e.g., into the [[Americas]], [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] and Asia Pacific).<ref name=\"apec.org\">[http://www.apec.org/about-us/about-apec/member-economies.aspx Member Economies - Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709153701/https://www.apec.org/about-us/about-apec/member-economies.aspx |date=2018-07-09 }}.

The term has become popular since the late 1980s in commerce, finance and politics. Despite the heterogeneity of the regions' economies, most individual nations within the zone are emerging markets experiencing rapid growth.
