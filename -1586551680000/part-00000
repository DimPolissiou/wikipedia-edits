In fact, all cubic equations can be reduced to this form if we allow {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} to be negative, but [[negative number]]s were not known to him at that time. Del Ferro kept his achievement secret until just before his death, when he told his student Antonio Fior about it.\n[[Image:Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia.jpg|thumb|160px|Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia]]\nIn 1530, [[Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia]] (1500\u20131557) received two problems in cubic equations from [[Zuanne da Coi]] and announced that he could solve them. He was soon challenged by Fior, which led to a famous contest between the two. Each contestant had to put up a certain amount of money and to propose a number of problems for his rival to solve. Whoever solved more problems within 30 days would get all the money. Tartaglia received questions in the form {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''mx'' {{=}} ''n''}}, for which he had worked out a general method. Fior received questions in the form {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''mx''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''n''}}, which proved to be too difficult for him to solve, and Tartaglia won the contest.\n\nLater, Tartaglia was persuaded by [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501\u20131576) to reveal his secret for solving cubic equations. In 1539, Tartaglia did so only on the condition that Cardano would never reveal it and that if he did write a book about cubics, he would give Tartaglia time to publish. Some years later, Cardano learned about del Ferro's prior work and published del Ferro's method in his book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]'' in 1545, meaning Cardano gave Tartaglia six years to publish his results (with credit given to Tartaglia for an independent solution). Cardano's promise to Tartaglia said that he would not publish Tartaglia's work, and Cardano felt he was publishing del Ferro's, so as to get around the promise. Nevertheless, this led to a challenge to Cardano from Tartaglia, which Cardano denied. The challenge was eventually accepted by Cardano's student [[Lodovico Ferrari]] (1522\u20131565). Ferrari did better than Tartaglia in the competition, and Tartaglia lost both his prestige and his income.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Katz |first=Victor |title=A History of Mathematics |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema00katz/page/220 220] |location=Boston |publisher=Addison Wesley |year=2004 |isbn=9780321016188 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema00katz/page/220 }}</ref>\n\nCardano noticed that Tartaglia's method sometimes required him to extract the square root of a negative number.

Such an equation \n:<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0,</math>\nwith integer coefficients, is said to be [[reducible polynomial|reducible]] if the polynomial of the left-hand side is the product of polynomials of lower degrees. By [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's lemma]], if the equation is reducible, one can suppose that the factors have integer coefficients.\n\nFinding the roots of a reducible cubic equation is easier than solving the general case. In fact, if the equation is reducible, one of the factors must have the degree one, and have thus the form\n:<math>qx-p</math>\nwith {{mvar|q}} and {{mvar|p}} being [[coprime integers]]. The [[rational root test]] allows finding {{mvar|q}} and {{mvar|p}} by examining a finite number of cases (because {{mvar|q}} must be a divisor of {{mvar|a}}, and {{mvar|p}} must be a divisor of {{mvar|d}}).\n\nThus, one root is <math>\\textstyle x_1= \\frac pq,</math> and the other roots are the roots of the other factor, which can be found by [[polynomial long division]]. This other factor is \n:<math>\\frac aq x^2+ \\frac{bq+ap}{q^2}x+\\frac{cq^2+bpq+ap^2}{q^3}</math>\n(The coefficients seem not to be integers, but must be integers if {{math|''p'' / ''q''}} is a root.)\n\nThen, the other roots are the roots of this [[quadratic polynomial]] and can be found by using the [[quadratic formula]].\n\n==Depressed cubic{{anchor|Reduction to a depressed cubic}}==\nCubics of the form \n:<math>t^3+pt+q</math>\nare said to be depressed. They are much simpler than general cubics, but are fundamental, because the study of any cubic may be reduced by a simple [[change of variable]] to that of a depressed cubic.\n\nLet \n:<math>ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0</math>\nbe a cubic equation. The  change of variable\n:<math>x=t-\\frac b{3a}</math>\nleads to a cubic that has no term in {{math|''t''<sup>2</sup>}}. After dividing by {{mvar|a}} one gets the ''depressed cubic equation'' \n:<math>t^3+pt+q=0,</math>\nwith \n:<math>\\begin{align}\nt=&x+\\frac b{3a}\\\\\np=&\\frac{3ac-b^2}{3a^2} \\\\\nq=&\\frac{2b^3-9abc+27a^2d}{27a^3}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe [[zero of a function|roots]] <math>x_1, x_2, x_3</math> of the original equation are related to the roots <math>t_1,t_2,t_3</math> of the depressed equation by the relations \n::<math>x_i=t_i-\\frac b{3a},</math>\nfor <math>i = 1, 2, 3</math>.\n\n==Discriminant and nature of the roots==\nThe nature (real or not, distinct or not) of the [[zero of a function|roots]] of a cubic can be determined without computing them explicitly, by using the [[discriminant]].\n\n===Discriminant===\nThe [[discriminant]] of a [[polynomial]] is a function of its coefficients that is zero if and only if the polynomial has a [[multiple root]],  or, if it is divisible by the square of a non-constant polynomial. In other words, the discriminant is nonzero if and only if the polynomial is [[square-free polynomial|square-free]].\n\nIf {{math|''r''{{sub|1}}, ''r''{{sub|2}}, ''r''{{sub|3}}}} are the three [[root of a function|roots]] (not necessarily distinct nor [[real number|real]]) of the cubic <math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d,</math> then the discriminant is\n:<math>a^4(r_1-r_2)^2(r_1-r_3)^2(r_2-r_3)^2.</math>\n\nThe discriminant of the depressed cubic <math>t^3+pt+q</math> is \n:<math>-\\left(4\\,p^3+27\\,q^2\\right).</math>\n\nThe discriminant of the general cubic <math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</math> is \n:<math>18\\,abcd - 4\\,b^3d + b^2c^2 - 4\\,ac^3 - 27\\,a^2d^2.</math>\nIt is the product of <math>a^4</math> and the discriminant of the corresponding depressed cubic. It follows that one of these two discriminants is zero if and only if the other is also zero, and, if the coefficients are [[real number|real]], the two discriminants have the same sign. In summary, the same information can be deduced from these two discriminants.\n\nTo prove the preceding formulas, one can use [[Vieta's formulas]] to express everything as polynomials in {{math|''r''{{sub|1}}, ''r''{{sub|2}}, ''r''{{sub|3}}}}, and {{mvar|a}}. The proof then results in the verification of the equality of two polynomials.\n\n===Nature of the roots===\nIf the coefficients of the polynomial are [[real number]]s and the discriminant <math>\\Delta</math> is not zero, there are two cases:\n\n*If <math>\\Delta>0,</math> the cubic has three distinct real [[zero of a function|roots]]\n*If <math>\\Delta<0,</math> the cubic has one real root and two non-real [[complex conjugate]] roots.\n\nThis can be proved as follows. First, if {{mvar|r}} is a root of a polynomial with real coefficients, then its [[complex conjugate]] is also a root. So the non-real roots, if any, occur as pairs of complex conjugate roots. As a cubic polynomial has three roots (not necessarily distinct) by the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], at least one root must be real.\n\nAs stated above, if {{math|''r''{{sub|1}}, ''r''{{sub|2}}, ''r''{{sub|3}}}} are the three roots of the cubic <math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</math>, then the discriminant is \n:<math>\\Delta=a^4(r_1-r_2)^2(r_1-r_3)^2(r_2-r_3)^2</math>\n\nIf the three roots are real and distinct, the discriminant is a product of positive reals, that is <math>\\Delta>0.</math>\n\nIf only one root, say {{math|''r''{{sub|1}}}}, is real, then {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} and {{math|''r''{{sub|3}}}} are complex conjugates, which implies that {{math|''r''{{sub|2}} \u2013 ''r''{{sub|3}}}} is a [[purely imaginary number]], and thus that {{math|(''r''{{sub|2}} \u2013 ''r''{{sub|3}}){{sup|2}}}} is real and negative. On the other hand, {{math|''r''{{sub|1}} \u2013 ''r''{{sub|2}}}} and {{math|''r''{{sub|1}} \u2013 ''r''{{sub|3}}}} are complex conjugates, and their product is real and positive. Thus the discriminant is the product of a single negative number and several positive ones. That is <math>\\Delta<0.</math>\n\n===Multiple root===\n\nIf the discriminant of a cubic is zero, the cubic has a [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiple root]], and all of its roots are real.\n\nThe discriminant of the depressed cubic <math>t^3+pt+q</math> equals zero if <math>4p^3+27q^2=0.</math> If {{mvar|p}}  is also zero, then {{math|1=''p'' = ''q'' = 0}}, and 0 is a triple root of the cubic. If <math>4p^3+27q^2=0,</math> and {{math|''p'' \u2260 0}}, then the cubic has a simple root\n:<math>t_1=\\frac {3q}p</math>\nand a double root\n:<math>t_2=t_3=\\frac {-3q}{2p}.</math>\nIn other words,\n:<math>t^3+pt+q=\\left(t-\\frac {3q}p\\right)\\left(t+\\frac{3q}{2p}\\right)^2.</math>\n\nThis result can be proved by expanding the latter product or retrieved by solving the rather simple [[system of equations]] resulting from [[Vieta's formulas]].\n\nBy using the [[#Depressed cubic|reduction of a depressed cubic]], these results can be extended to the general cubic. This gives: if the discriminant of the cubic <math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</math> is zero, then \n*either, if <math>b^2=3ac,</math> the cubic has a triple root\n::<math>x_1=x_2=x_3=\\frac {-b}{3a},</math>\n:and\n::<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d = a\\left(x+\\frac {b}{3a}\\right)^3</math>\n*or, if <math>b^2\\ne 3ac,</math> the cubic has a double root \n::<math>x_2=x_3=\\frac{9ad-bc}{2(b^2-3ac)},</math>\n:and a simple root,\n::<math>x_1=\\frac{4abc-9a^2d-b^3}{a(b^2-3ac)}.</math>\n:and thus\n::<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d = a\\left(x-x_1\\right)\\left(x-x_2\\right)^2.</math>\n\n===Characteristic 2 and 3===\nThe above results are valid when the coefficients belong to a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] other than 2 or 3, but must be modified for characteristic 2 or 3, because of the involved divisions by 2 and 3.\n\nThe reduction to a depressed cubic works for characteristic 2, but not for characteristic 3. However, in both cases, it is simpler to establish and state the results for the general cubic. The main tool for that is the fact that a multiple root is a common root of the polynomial and its [[formal derivative]]. In these characteristics, if the derivative is not a constant, it has a single root, being linear in characteristic 3, or the square of a linear polynomial in characteristic 2. This allows computing the multiple root, and the third root can be deduced from the sum of the roots, which is provided by [[Vieta's formulas]].\n\nA difference with other characteristics is that, in characteristic 2, the formula for a double root involves a square root, and, in characteristic 3, the formula for a triple root involves a cube root.\n<!-- This is a unfinished extension of the section for giving explicitly the roots. This has been commented, because this seems too detailed for the importance of the case.\n\n====Characteristic 2====\nIn characteristic 2, the derivative of the cubic <math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</math> is \n:<math>3bx^2+c=bx^2+c.</math>\nAs this polynomial is a square (at least over some [[field extension]] of the field of the coefficients), one gets: \n*if the discriminant is 0, and {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}, one has also {{math|1=''d'' = 0}}, and thus the factorization\n::<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=x(ax^2+b);</math>\n:that is, the simple root is 0, and the double root is the square root of {{math|''b''/''a''}} (remember that {{math|1=1 = \u20131}} in characteristic two);\n*if the discriminant is zero, and {{math|1=''b'' \u2260 0}}, one has the factorization\n::<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=(ax+b)(x^2+c/b);</math>\n*there is a triple root if and only <math>c=b^2/a</math> and <math>d=b^3/a^2.</math>\n\n====Characteristic 3====\nIn characteristic 3, the derivative of the cubic <math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</math> is \n:<math>2bx+c=c-bx.</math>\n\nIf the discriminant is zero and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}, the multiple root is this <math>c/b.</math> This gives the factorization \n:<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=(ax+b-ac/b)(x-c/b)^2.</math> -->\n\n==Cardano's formula==\n\n[[Gerolamo Cardano]] is credited of the first formula for solving cubic equation. His formula applies to depressed cubics, but, as shown in {{slink||Depressed cubic}}, it allows solving all cubic equations.\n\nCardano's original result is that, if \n:<math>x^3+px+q=0</math>\nis a cubic equation such that {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are [[real number]]s such that <math>4p^3+27q^2 >0,</math> then the equation has the real root\n:<math>\\sqrt[3]{-\\frac q2+\\sqrt{\\frac{q^2}4+\\frac{p^3}{27}}} +\\sqrt[3]{-\\frac q2-\\sqrt{\\frac{q^2}4+\\frac{p^3}{27}}}.</math>\n\nSee {{slink||Derivation of the roots}}, below, for several methods for getting this result.\n\nAs shown in {{slink||Nature of the roots}}, the two other roots are non-real [[complex conjugate]] numbers, in this case. It was later shown (Cardano did not know [[complex number]]s) that the two other roots are obtained by multiplying one of the cube root by the [[primitive root of unity|primitive cube root of unity]] <math>\\frac{-1+i\\sqrt 3} 2,</math> and the other cube root by <math>\\frac{-1-i\\sqrt 3} 2.</math>\n\nIf <math>4p^3+27q^2 < 0,</math> there are three real roots, but [[Galois theory]] allows proving that they cannot be expressed by an [[algebraic expression]] involving only real numbers. Therefore, the equation cannot be solved in this case with the knowledge of Cardano's time. This case has thus been called ''[[casus irreducibilis]]'', meaning ''irreducible case'' in Latin.\n\nIn ''casus irreducibilis'', Cardano's formula can still be used, but some care is needed in the use cube roots. A first method is to define the symbols <math>\\sqrt{{~}^{~}}</math> and <math>\\sqrt[3]{{~}^{~}}</math> as representing the [[principal value]]s of the root function (that is the root that has the largest real part). With this convention Cardano's formula for the three roots remains valid, but is not purely algebraic, as the definition of a principal part is not purely algebraic, since it involves inequalities for comparing real parts. Also, the use of principal cube root may give a wrong result if the coefficients are non-real complex numbers. Moreover, if the coefficients belong to another [[field (mathematics)|field]], the principal cube root is not defined in general.\n\nThe second way for making Cardano's formula always correct, is to remark that the product of the two cube roots must be {{math|\u2013''p'' / 3}}. It results that a root of the equation is \n:<math>C-\\frac p{3C}\\quad\\text{with}\\quad C=\\sqrt[3]{-\\frac q2+\\sqrt{\\frac{q^2}4+\\frac{p^3}{27}}}. </math>\nIn this formula, the symbols <math>\\sqrt{{~}^{~}}</math> and <math>\\sqrt[3]{{~}^{~}}</math> denote any square root and any cube root. The other roots of the equation are obtained either by changing of cube root or, equivalently, by multiplying the cube root by a primitive cube root of the unity, that is <math>\\textstyle \\frac{-1\\pm \\sqrt{-3}}2.</math>\n\nThis formula for the roots is always correct except when {{math|1=''p'' = ''q'' = 0}}, under the condition, if {{math|1=''q'' = 0}}, of choosing the square root for having {{math|''C'' \u2260 0}}. However, the formula is useless in these cases as the roots can be expressed without any cube root. Similarly, the formula is also useless in the other cases where no cube root is needed, that is when <math>4p^3+27q^2=0</math> and when the cubic polynomial is not [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]].\n\nThis formula is also correct when {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} belong to any [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] other than 2 or 3.\n\n==General cubic formula==\n\nA ''cubic formula'' for the roots of the general cubic equation (with {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}})\n:<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0</math>\ncan be deduced from every variant of Cardano's formula by reduction to a [[#Depressed cubic|depressed cubic]]. The variant that is presented here is valid not only for real coefficients, but also for coefficients {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''}} belonging to any [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] different of 2 and 3.\n\nThe formula being rather complicated, it is worth splitting it in smaller formulas.\n\nLet\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\Delta_0 &= b^2 - 3ac,\\\\\n\\Delta_1 &= 2b^3 - 9abc + 27a^2d,\n\\end{align}</math>\nand \n:<math>C = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{\\Delta_1 \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta_1^2 - 4 \\Delta_0^3}}2},</math>\nwhere the symbols <math>\\sqrt{{~}^{~}}</math> and <math>\\sqrt[3]{{~}^{~}}</math> denote any square root and any cube root, respectively. The sign \"{{math|\u00b1}}\" before the square root is either \"{{math|+}}\" or \"{{math|\u2013}}\"; the choice is almost arbitrary, and changing it amounts to change of square root. However, if one choice leads to {{math|1=''C'' = 0}}, the other sign must be selected.\nThen,  one of the roots is\n:<math>x = - \\frac{1}{3a}\\left(b+C+\\frac{\\Delta_0}{C}\\right)\\text{.}</math>\n\nThe other two roots can be obtained by changing the choice of the cube root in the definition of {{mvar|C}}, or, equivalently by multiplying {{math|C}} by a [[primitive root of unity|primitive cube root of unity]], that is {{math|{{sfrac|\u20131 \u00b1 {{sqrt|\u20133}}|2}}}}. In other words, the three roots are \n:<math>x_k = - \\frac{1}{3a}\\left(b+\\xi^kC+\\frac{\\Delta_0}{\\xi^kC}\\right), \\qquad k \\in \\{0,1,2\\} \\text{,}</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03be'' {{=}} {{sfrac|\u20131 + {{sqrt|\u20133}}|2}}}}.\n\nAs for the special case of a depressed cubic, this formula applies but is useless when the roots can be expressed without cube roots.\n\n==Trigonometric and hyperbolic solutions==<!-- linked from redirect [[Chebyshev cube root]] -->\n\n===Trigonometric solution for three real roots===\n\nWhen a cubic equation with real coefficients has three real roots, the formulas expressing these roots in terms of radicals involve complex numbers. [[Galois theory]] allows proving that when the three roots are real, and none is rational (''[[casus irreducibilis]]''), one cannot express the roots in terms of real radicals.

Graphically this corresponds to simply shifting the graph horizontally when changing between the variables {{mvar|t}} and {{mvar|x}}, without changing the angle relationships.

There is an interesting geometrical relationship among all these roots.\n\nThe points in the complex plane representing the three roots serve as the vertices of an isosceles triangle. (The triangle is isosceles because one root is on the horizontal (real) axis and the other two roots, being complex conjugates, appear symmetrically above and below the real axis.) [[Marden's theorem]] says that the points representing the roots of the derivative of the cubic are the [[focus (geometry)|foci]] of the [[Steiner inellipse]] of the triangle\u2014the unique ellipse that is tangent to the triangle at the midpoints of its sides. If the angle at the vertex on the real axis is less than {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}}} then the major axis of the ellipse lies on the real axis, as do its foci and hence the roots of the derivative. If that angle is greater than {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}}}, the major axis is vertical and its foci, the roots of the derivative, are complex conjugates. And if that angle is {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}}}, the triangle is equilateral, the Steiner inellipse is simply the triangle's incircle, its foci coincide with each other at the incenter, which lies on the real axis, and hence the derivative has duplicate real roots.\n\n==Galois group==\n\nGiven a cubic [[irreducible polynomial]] over a field {{mvar|k}} of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] different from 2 and 3, the [[Galois theory#Permutation group approach to Galois theory|Galois group]] over {{mvar|k}} is the group of the [[field automorphism]]s that fix {{mvar|k}} of the smallest extension of {{mvar|k}} ([[splitting field]]). As these automorphismes must permute the roots of the polynomials, this group is either the group {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}} of all six permutations of the three roots, or the group {{math|''A''<sub>3</sub>}} of the three circular permutations.\n\nThe discriminant {{math|\u0394}} of the cubic is the square of \n:<math>\\sqrt \\Delta =a^2(r_1-r_2)(r_1-r_3)(r_2-r_3),</math>\nwhere {{mvar|a}} is the leading coefficient of the cubic, and {{math|''r''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}} and {{math|''r''<sub>3</sub>}} are the three roots of the cubic. As <math>\\sqrt \\Delta</math> changes of sign if two roots are exchanged, <math>\\sqrt \\Delta</math> is fixed by the Galois group only if the Galois group is \n{{math|''A''<sub>3</sub>}}. In other words, the Galois group is {{math|''A''<sub>3</sub>}} if and only if the discriminant is the square of an element of {{mvar|k}}.\n\nAs most integers are not squares, when working over the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of the [[rational number]]s, the Galois group of most irreducible cubic polynomials is the group {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}} with six elements. An example of a Galois group {{math|''A''<sub>3</sub>}} with three elements is given by {{math|''p''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 3''x'' \u2212 1}}, whose discriminant is {{math|81 {{=}} 9<sup>2</sup >}}.\n\n==Derivation of the roots==\n\nThis section regroup several methods for deriving [[#Cardano's formula|Cardano's formula]].\n\n===Cardano's method===\nThis method is due to [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]], but is named after [[Gerolamo Cardano]] who first published it in his book [[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|''Ars Magna'']] (1545).\n\nThis method applies to a depressed cubic {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}. The idea is to introduce two variables {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} such that {{math|''u'' + ''v'' {{=}} ''t''}} and to substitute this in the depressed cubic, giving\n:<math>u^3 + v^3 + (3uv + p)(u+v)+ q= 0.</math>\n\nAt this point Cardano imposed the condition {{math|3''uv'' + ''p'' {{=}} 0}}. This removes the third term in previous  equality, leading to the system of equations\n:<math>\\begin{align}u^3 + v^3&=-q \\\\ uv&=-\\frac p3.\\end{align}</math>\n\nKnowing the sum and the product of {{math|''u''<sup>3</sup>}} and {{math|''v''<sup>3</sup>}}, one deduces that they are the two solutions of the [[quadratic equation]] \n:<math>(x - u^3)(x - v^3) = x^2 - (u^3 + v^3)x + u^3v^3 = x^2 - (u^3 + v^3)x + (uv)^3 = 0,</math> \nso\n:<math>x^2 + qx -\\frac {p^3}{27}=0,</math>\nThe discriminant of this equation is <math>\\Delta = q^2 + \\frac{4p^3}{27}</math>, and assuming it is positive, real solutions to this equations are (after folding division by 4 under the square root):\n:<math>-\\frac q2 \\pm \\sqrt {\\frac {q^2}{4} +\\frac {p^3}{27}}.</math>\nSo (without loss of generality in choosing u or v):\n:<math>u = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac q2 + \\sqrt {\\frac {q^2}{4} +\\frac {p^3}{27}}}.</math>\n:<math>v = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac q2 - \\sqrt {\\frac {q^2}{4} +\\frac {p^3}{27}}}.</math>\nAs {{math|''u'' + ''v'' {{=}} ''t''}}, the sum of the cube roots of these solutions is a root if the equation. That is \n:<math>t=\\sqrt[3]{-{q\\over 2}+\\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}} +\\sqrt[3]{-{q\\over 2}-\\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}}</math>\nis a root of the equation; this is Cardano's formula.\n\nThis works well when <math>4p^3+27q^2 > 0,</math> but, if <math>4p^3+27q^2 < 0,</math> the square root appearing in the formula is not real. As a [[complex number]] has three cube roots, using Cardano's formula without care would provide nine roots, while a cubic equation cannot have more three roots. This has been clarified first by [[Rafael Bombelli]] in his book ''L'Algebra'' (1572). The solution is to use the fact that {{math|1=''uv'' = {{sfrac|\u2013''p''|3}}}}, that is {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|\u2013''p''|3''u''}}}}. This means that only one cube root need to be computed, and leads to the second formula given in {{slink||Cardano's formula}}.\n\nThe other roots of the equation can be obtained by changing of cube root, or, equivalently, by multiplying the cube root by each of the two [[primitive root of unity|primitive cube roots of unity]], which are <math>\\frac {-1\\pm \\sqrt{-3}}2.</math>\n\n=== Vieta's substitution ===\nVieta's substitution is a method introduced by [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]] (Vieta is his Latin name) in a text published posthumously in 1615, which provides directly the second formula of {{slink||Cardano's method}}, and avoids the problem of computing two different cube roots.<ref>{{Citation|last = van der Waerden|first = Bartel Leenert|author-link = Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|title = A History of Algebra: From al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b to Emmy Noether|publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|year = 1985|chapter = From Vi\u00e8te to Descartes|isbn = 3-540-13610-X}}</ref>\n\nStarting from the depressed cubic {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}, Vieta's substitution is {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''w'' \u2013 {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''}}}}.<ref>More precisely, Vieta introduced a new variable {{mvar|w}} and imposed the condition {{math|''w''(''t'' + ''w'') {{=}} {{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}. This is equivalent with the substitution {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''}} \u2013 ''w''}}, and differs from the substitution that is used here only by a change of sign of {{mvar|w}}. This change of sign allows getting directly the formulas of {{slink||Cardano's formula}}.</ref>\n\nThe substitution {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''w'' \u2013 {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''}}}} transforms the depressed cubic into\n:<math>w^3+q-\\frac{p^3}{27w^3}=0.</math>\n\nMultiplying by {{math|''w''<sup>3</sup>}}, one gets a quadratic equation in {{mvar|w{{sup|3}}}}:\n:<math>(w^3)^2+q(w^3)-\\frac{p^3}{27}=0.</math>\n\nLet \n:<math>W=-\\frac q 2\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{p^3}{27} + \\frac {q^2} 4}</math> \nbe any nonzero root of this quadratic equation. If {{math|''w''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''w''<sub>2</sub>}} and {{math|''w''<sub>3</sub>}} are the three [[cube root]]s of {{mvar|W}}, then the roots of the original depressed cubic are {{math|''w''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''<sub>1</sub>}}}}, {{math|''w''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''<sub>2</sub>}}}}, and {{math|''w''<sub>3</sub> \u2212 {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''<sub>3</sub>}}}}.  The other   root of the quadratic equation is <math>\\textstyle -\\frac {p^3}{27W}.</math> This implies that changing the sign of the square root exchanges {{math|''w''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|\u2212 {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''<sub>''i''</sub>}}}} for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, 2, 3}}, and therefore does not change the roots. This method only fails when both roots of the quadratic equation are zero, that is when {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''q'' {{=}} 0}}, in which case the only root of the depressed cubic is {{math|0}}.\n\n===Lagrange's method===\nIn his paper ''R\u00e9flexions sur la r\u00e9solution alg\u00e9brique des \u00e9quations'' (\"Thoughts on the algebraic solving of equations\"),<ref>{{Citation|last = Lagrange|first = Joseph-Louis|author-link = Joseph Louis Lagrange|chapter = R\u00e9flexions sur la r\u00e9solution alg\u00e9brique des \u00e9quations|title = \u0152uvres de Lagrange|editor-last = Serret|editor-first = Joseph-Alfred|editor-link = Joseph Alfred Serret|year = 1869|origyear = 1771|publisher = Gauthier-Villars|pages = 205\u2013421|volume = III}}</ref> [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] introduced a new method to solve equations of low degree in a uniform way, with the hope that he could generalize it for higher degrees.

This has been proved later, and named [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]. Nevertheless, the modern methods for solving solvable quintic equations are mainly based on Lagrange's method.<ref name=\"laz\" />\n\nIn the case of cubic equations, Lagrange's method gives the same solution as Cardano's. Lagrange's method can be applied directly to the general cubic equation  {{math|''ax''<sup>3</sup> + ''bx''<sup>2</sup> + ''cx'' + ''d'' {{=}} 0}}, but the computation is simpler with the depressed cubic equation, {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nLagrange's main idea was to work with the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of the roots instead with the roots themselves. More precisely, let {{mvar|\u03be}} be a [[primitive root of unity|primitive third root of unity]], that is a number such that {{math|''\u03be''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''\u03be''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03be'' + 1 {{=}} 0}} (when working in the space of [[complex number]]s, one has <math>\\textstyle \\xi=\\frac{-1\\pm i\\sqrt 3}2=e^{2i\\pi/3},</math> but this complex interpretation is not used here). Denoting {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} the three roots of the cubic equation to be solved, let\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ns_0 &= x_0 + x_1 + x_2,\\\\\ns_1 &= x_0 + \\xi x_1 + \\xi^2 x_2,\\\\\ns_2 &= x_0 + \\xi^2 x_1 + \\xi x_2,\n\\end{align}</math>\nbe the discrete Fourier transform of the roots. If {{math|''s''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} are known, the roots may be recovered from them with the inverse Fourier transform consisting of inverting this linear transformation; that is,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx_0 &= \\tfrac13(s_0 + s_1 + s_2),\\\\\nx_1 &= \\tfrac13(s_0 + \\xi^2 s_1 + \\xi s_2),\\\\\nx_2 &= \\tfrac13(s_0 + \\xi s_1 + \\xi ^2 s_2).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy [[Vieta's formulas]], {{math|''s''<sub>0</sub>}} is known to be zero in the case of a depressed cubic, and {{math|\u2212{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}} for the general cubic. So, only {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} need to be computed. They are not [[symmetric polynomial|symmetric functions]] of the roots (exchanging {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} exchanges also {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}}), but some simple symmetric functions of {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} are also symmetric in the roots of the cubic equation to be solved. Thus these symmetric functions can be expressed in terms of the (known) coefficients of the original cubic, and this allows eventually  expressing the {{mvar|s{{sub|i}}}} as roots of a polynomial with known coefficients.\n\nIn the case of a cubic equation, {{math|1=''P''=''s''<sub>1</sub>''s''<sub>2</sub>}}, and {{math|1=''S''=''s''<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + ''s''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>}} are such symmetric polynomials (see below). It follows that {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>}} are the two roots of the quadratic equation {{math|''z''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''Sz'' + ''P''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 0}}. Thus the resolution of the equation may be finished exactly as with Cardano's method, with {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} in place of {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}.\n\nIn the case of the depressed cubic, one has {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|1|3}}(''s''<sub>1</sub> + ''s''<sub>2</sub>)}} and {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>''s''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} \u22123''p''}}, while in Cardano's method we have set {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''u'' + ''v''}} and {{math|''uv'' {{=}} \u2212{{sfrac|1|3}}''p''}}. Thus we have, up to the exchange of {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}, {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 3''u''}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} 3''v''}} . In other words, in this case, Cardano's method and Lagrange's method compute exactly the same things, up to a factor of three in the auxiliary variables, the main difference being that Lagrange's method explains why these auxiliary variables appear in the problem.\n\n====Computation of {{mvar|S}} and {{mvar|P}}====\n\nA straightforward computation using the relations {{math|''\u03be''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''\u03be''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03be'' + 1 {{=}} 0}} gives \n:<math>\\begin{align}\nP&=s_1s_2=x_0^2+x_1^2+x_2^2-(x_0x_1+x_1x_2+x_2x_0),\\\\\nS&=s_1^3+s_2^3=2(x_0^3+x_1^3+x_2^3)-3(x_0^2x_1+x_1^2x_2+x_2^2x_0+x_0x_1^2+x_1x_2^2+x_2x_0^2)+12x_0x_1x_2.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThis shows that {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}} are symmetric functions of the roots. Using [[Newton's identities]], it is straightforward to express them in terms of the [[elementary symmetric polynomial|elementary symmetric functions]] of the roots, giving\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nP&=e_1^2-3e_2,\\\\\nS&=2e_1^3-9e_1e_2+27e_3,\n\\end{align}</math>\nwith {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''e''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} ''p''}} and {{math|''e''<sub>3</sub> {{=}} \u2212''q''}} in the case of a depressed cubic, and {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} \u2212{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}, {{math|''e''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}} and {{math|''e''<sub>3</sub> {{=}} \u2212{{sfrac|''d''|''a''}}}}, in the general case.\n\n==Applications==\n\nCubic equations arise in various other contexts.\n\n=== In mathematics ===\n* [[Angle trisection]] and [[doubling the cube]] are two ancient problems of [[geometry]] that have been proved to not be solvable  by [[straightedge and compass construction]], because they are equivalent to solving a cubic equation.\n* [[Marden's theorem]] states that the [[focus (geometry)|foci]] of the [[Steiner inellipse]] of any triangle can be found by using the cubic function whose roots are the coordinates in the [[complex plane]] of the triangle's three vertices. The roots of the [[first derivative]] of this cubic are the complex coordinates of those foci.\n* The [[area]] of a regular [[heptagon]] can be expressed in terms of the roots of a cubic. Further, the ratios of the long diagonal to the side, the side to the short diagonal, and the negative of the short diagonal to the long diagonal all satisfy a particular cubic equation. In addition, the ratio of the [[inradius]] to the [[circumradius]] of a [[heptagonal triangle]] is one of the solutions of a cubic equation. The values of trigonometric functions of angles related to <math>2\\pi/7</math> satisfy cubic equations.\n* Given the cosine (or other trigonometric function) of an arbitrary angle, the cosine of [[angle trisection|one-third of that angle]] is one of the roots of a cubic.\n* The solution of the general [[quartic equation]] relies on the solution of its [[resolvent cubic]].\n* The [[eigenvalue]]s of a 3\u00d73 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] are the roots of a cubic polynomial which is the [[characteristic polynomial]] of the matrix.\n* The [[characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic equation]] of a third-order constant coeffecients [[linear differential equation]] or [[difference equation]] is a cubic equation.\n* Intersection points of cubic [[B\u00e9zier curve]] and straight line can be computed using direct cubic equation representing B\u00e9zier curve.\n\n=== In other sciences ===\n* In [[analytical chemistry]], the [[Charlot equation]], which can be used to find the pH of [[buffer solution]]s, can be solved using a cubic equation.\n* In [[chemical engineering]] and [[thermodynamics]], [[equation of state#Cubic equations of state|equations of state]] (which relate pressure, volume, and temperature of a substances) are cubic in the volume.\n* [[kinematics|Kinematic equations]] involving changing [[jerk (physics)|rates of acceleration]] are cubic.\n* The speed of seismic Rayleigh waves is a solution of the [[Rayleigh wave#Rayleigh wave dispersion|Rayleigh wave]] cubic equation.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation\n |first= Lucye\n |last= Guilbeau\n |year= 1930\n |title= The History of the Solution of the Cubic Equation\n |journal= Mathematics News Letter\n |volume= 5\n |issue= 4\n |pages= 8&ndash;12\n |doi=10.2307/3027812\n |jstor= 3027812}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Citation\n |first= W.

In fact, all cubic equations can be reduced to this form if we allow {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} to be negative, but [[negative number]]s were not known to him at that time. Del Ferro kept his achievement secret until just before his death, when he told his student Antonio Fior about it.\n[[Image:Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia.jpg|thumb|160px|Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia]]\nIn 1530, [[Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia]] (1500\u20131557) received two problems in cubic equations from [[Zuanne da Coi]] and announced that he could solve them. He was soon challenged by Fior, which led to a famous contest between the two. Each contestant had to put up a certain amount of money and to propose a number of problems for his rival to solve. Whoever solved more problems within 30 days would get all the money. Tartaglia received questions in the form {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''mx'' {{=}} ''n''}}, for which he had worked out a general method. Fior received questions in the form {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''mx''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''n''}}, which proved to be too difficult for him to solve, and Tartaglia won the contest.\n\nLater, Tartaglia was persuaded by [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501\u20131576) to reveal his secret for solving cubic equations. In 1539, Tartaglia did so only on the condition that Cardano would never reveal it and that if he did write a book about cubics, he would give Tartaglia time to publish. Some years later, Cardano learned about del Ferro's prior work and published del Ferro's method in his book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]'' in 1545, meaning Cardano gave Tartaglia six years to publish his results (with credit given to Tartaglia for an independent solution). Cardano's promise to Tartaglia said that he would not publish Tartaglia's work, and Cardano felt he was publishing del Ferro's, so as to get around the promise. Nevertheless, this led to a challenge to Cardano from Tartaglia, which Cardano denied. The challenge was eventually accepted by Cardano's student [[Lodovico Ferrari]] (1522\u20131565). Ferrari did better than Tartaglia in the competition, and Tartaglia lost both his prestige and his income.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Katz |first=Victor |title=A History of Mathematics |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema00katz/page/220 220] |location=Boston |publisher=Addison Wesley |year=2004 |isbn=9780321016188 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema00katz/page/220 }}</ref>\n\nCardano noticed that Tartaglia's method sometimes required him to extract the square root of a negative number.

Such an equation \n:<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0,</math>\nwith integer coefficients, is said to be [[reducible polynomial|reducible]] if the polynomial of the left-hand side is the product of polynomials of lower degrees. By [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's lemma]], if the equation is reducible, one can suppose that the factors have integer coefficients.\n\nFinding the roots of a reducible cubic equation is easier than solving the general case. In fact, if the equation is reducible, one of the factors must have the degree one, and have thus the form\n:<math>qx-p</math>\nwith {{mvar|q}} and {{mvar|p}} being [[coprime integers]]. The [[rational root test]] allows finding {{mvar|q}} and {{mvar|p}} by examining a finite number of cases (because {{mvar|q}} must be a divisor of {{mvar|a}}, and {{mvar|p}} must be a divisor of {{mvar|d}}).\n\nThus, one root is <math>\\textstyle x_1= \\frac pq,</math> and the other roots are the roots of the other factor, which can be found by [[polynomial long division]]. This other factor is \n:<math>\\frac aq x^2+ \\frac{bq+ap}{q^2}x+\\frac{cq^2+bpq+ap^2}{q^3}</math>\n(The coefficients seem not to be integers, but must be integers if {{math|''p'' / ''q''}} is a root.)\n\nThen, the other roots are the roots of this [[quadratic polynomial]] and can be found by using the [[quadratic formula]].\n\n==Depressed cubic{{anchor|Reduction to a depressed cubic}}==\nCubics of the form \n:<math>t^3+pt+q</math>\nare said to be depressed. They are much simpler than general cubics, but are fundamental, because the study of any cubic may be reduced by a simple [[change of variable]] to that of a depressed cubic.\n\nLet \n:<math>ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0</math>\nbe a cubic equation. The  change of variable\n:<math>x=t-\\frac b{3a}</math>\nleads to a cubic that has no term in {{math|''t''<sup>2</sup>}}. After dividing by {{mvar|a}} one gets the ''depressed cubic equation'' \n:<math>t^3+pt+q=0,</math>\nwith \n:<math>\\begin{align}\nt=&x+\\frac b{3a}\\\\\np=&\\frac{3ac-b^2}{3a^2} \\\\\nq=&\\frac{2b^3-9abc+27a^2d}{27a^3}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe [[zero of a function|roots]] <math>x_1, x_2, x_3</math> of the original equation are related to the roots <math>t_1,t_2,t_3</math> of the depressed equation by the relations \n::<math>x_i=t_i-\\frac b{3a},</math>\nfor <math>i = 1, 2, 3</math>.\n\n==Discriminant and nature of the roots==\nThe nature (real or not, distinct or not) of the [[zero of a function|roots]] of a cubic can be determined without computing them explicitly, by using the [[discriminant]].\n\n===Discriminant===\nThe [[discriminant]] of a [[polynomial]] is a function of its coefficients that is zero if and only if the polynomial has a [[multiple root]],  or, if it is divisible by the square of a non-constant polynomial. In other words, the discriminant is nonzero if and only if the polynomial is [[square-free polynomial|square-free]].\n\nIf {{math|''r''{{sub|1}}, ''r''{{sub|2}}, ''r''{{sub|3}}}} are the three [[root of a function|roots]] (not necessarily distinct nor [[real number|real]]) of the cubic <math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d,</math> then the discriminant is\n:<math>a^4(r_1-r_2)^2(r_1-r_3)^2(r_2-r_3)^2.</math>\n\nThe discriminant of the depressed cubic <math>t^3+pt+q</math> is \n:<math>-\\left(4\\,p^3+27\\,q^2\\right).</math>\n\nThe discriminant of the general cubic <math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</math> is \n:<math>18\\,abcd - 4\\,b^3d + b^2c^2 - 4\\,ac^3 - 27\\,a^2d^2.</math>\nIt is the product of <math>a^4</math> and the discriminant of the corresponding depressed cubic. It follows that one of these two discriminants is zero if and only if the other is also zero, and, if the coefficients are [[real number|real]], the two discriminants have the same sign. In summary, the same information can be deduced from these two discriminants.\n\nTo prove the preceding formulas, one can use [[Vieta's formulas]] to express everything as polynomials in {{math|''r''{{sub|1}}, ''r''{{sub|2}}, ''r''{{sub|3}}}}, and {{mvar|a}}. The proof then results in the verification of the equality of two polynomials.\n\n===Nature of the roots===\nIf the coefficients of the polynomial are [[real number]]s and the discriminant <math>\\Delta</math> is not zero, there are two cases:\n\n*If <math>\\Delta>0,</math> the cubic has three distinct real [[zero of a function|roots]]\n*If <math>\\Delta<0,</math> the cubic has one real root and two non-real [[complex conjugate]] roots.\n\nThis can be proved as follows. First, if {{mvar|r}} is a root of a polynomial with real coefficients, then its [[complex conjugate]] is also a root. So the non-real roots, if any, occur as pairs of complex conjugate roots. As a cubic polynomial has three roots (not necessarily distinct) by the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], at least one root must be real.\n\nAs stated above, if {{math|''r''{{sub|1}}, ''r''{{sub|2}}, ''r''{{sub|3}}}} are the three roots of the cubic <math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</math>, then the discriminant is \n:<math>\\Delta=a^4(r_1-r_2)^2(r_1-r_3)^2(r_2-r_3)^2</math>\n\nIf the three roots are real and distinct, the discriminant is a product of positive reals, that is <math>\\Delta>0.</math>\n\nIf only one root, say {{math|''r''{{sub|1}}}}, is real, then {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} and {{math|''r''{{sub|3}}}} are complex conjugates, which implies that {{math|''r''{{sub|2}} \u2013 ''r''{{sub|3}}}} is a [[purely imaginary number]], and thus that {{math|(''r''{{sub|2}} \u2013 ''r''{{sub|3}}){{sup|2}}}} is real and negative. On the other hand, {{math|''r''{{sub|1}} \u2013 ''r''{{sub|2}}}} and {{math|''r''{{sub|1}} \u2013 ''r''{{sub|3}}}} are complex conjugates, and their product is real and positive. Thus the discriminant is the product of a single negative number and several positive ones. That is <math>\\Delta<0.</math>\n\n===Multiple root===\n\nIf the discriminant of a cubic is zero, the cubic has a [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiple root]], and all of its roots are real.\n\nThe discriminant of the depressed cubic <math>t^3+pt+q</math> equals zero if <math>4p^3+27q^2=0.</math> If {{mvar|p}}  is also zero, then {{math|1=''p'' = ''q'' = 0}}, and 0 is a triple root of the cubic. If <math>4p^3+27q^2=0,</math> and {{math|''p'' \u2260 0}}, then the cubic has a simple root\n:<math>t_1=\\frac {3q}p</math>\nand a double root\n:<math>t_2=t_3=\\frac {-3q}{2p}.</math>\nIn other words,\n:<math>t^3+pt+q=\\left(t-\\frac {3q}p\\right)\\left(t+\\frac{3q}{2p}\\right)^2.</math>\n\nThis result can be proved by expanding the latter product or retrieved by solving the rather simple [[system of equations]] resulting from [[Vieta's formulas]].\n\nBy using the [[#Depressed cubic|reduction of a depressed cubic]], these results can be extended to the general cubic. This gives: if the discriminant of the cubic <math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</math> is zero, then \n*either, if <math>b^2=3ac,</math> the cubic has a triple root\n::<math>x_1=x_2=x_3=\\frac {-b}{3a},</math>\n:and\n::<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d = a\\left(x+\\frac {b}{3a}\\right)^3</math>\n*or, if <math>b^2\\ne 3ac,</math> the cubic has a double root \n::<math>x_2=x_3=\\frac{9ad-bc}{2(b^2-3ac)},</math>\n:and a simple root,\n::<math>x_1=\\frac{4abc-9a^2d-b^3}{a(b^2-3ac)}.</math>\n:and thus\n::<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d = a\\left(x-x_1\\right)\\left(x-x_2\\right)^2.</math>\n\n===Characteristic 2 and 3===\nThe above results are valid when the coefficients belong to a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] other than 2 or 3, but must be modified for characteristic 2 or 3, because of the involved divisions by 2 and 3.\n\nThe reduction to a depressed cubic works for characteristic 2, but not for characteristic 3. However, in both cases, it is simpler to establish and state the results for the general cubic. The main tool for that is the fact that a multiple root is a common root of the polynomial and its [[formal derivative]]. In these characteristics, if the derivative is not a constant, it has a single root, being linear in characteristic 3, or the square of a linear polynomial in characteristic 2. This allows computing the multiple root, and the third root can be deduced from the sum of the roots, which is provided by [[Vieta's formulas]].\n\nA difference with other characteristics is that, in characteristic 2, the formula for a double root involves a square root, and, in characteristic 3, the formula for a triple root involves a cube root.\n<!-- This is a unfinished extension of the section for giving explicitly the roots. This has been commented, because this seems too detailed for the importance of the case.\n\n====Characteristic 2====\nIn characteristic 2, the derivative of the cubic <math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</math> is \n:<math>3bx^2+c=bx^2+c.</math>\nAs this polynomial is a square (at least over some [[field extension]] of the field of the coefficients), one gets: \n*if the discriminant is 0, and {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}, one has also {{math|1=''d'' = 0}}, and thus the factorization\n::<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=x(ax^2+b);</math>\n:that is, the simple root is 0, and the double root is the square root of {{math|''b''/''a''}} (remember that {{math|1=1 = \u20131}} in characteristic two);\n*if the discriminant is zero, and {{math|1=''b'' \u2260 0}}, one has the factorization\n::<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=(ax+b)(x^2+c/b);</math>\n*there is a triple root if and only <math>c=b^2/a</math> and <math>d=b^3/a^2.</math>\n\n====Characteristic 3====\nIn characteristic 3, the derivative of the cubic <math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</math> is \n:<math>2bx+c=c-bx.</math>\n\nIf the discriminant is zero and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}, the multiple root is this <math>c/b.</math> This gives the factorization \n:<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=(ax+b-ac/b)(x-c/b)^2.</math> -->\n\n==Cardano's formula==\n\n[[Gerolamo Cardano]] is credited of the first formula for solving cubic equation. His formula applies to depressed cubics, but, as shown in {{slink||Depressed cubic}}, it allows solving all cubic equations.\n\nCardano's original result is that, if \n:<math>x^3+px+q=0</math>\nis a cubic equation such that {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are [[real number]]s such that <math>4p^3+27q^2 >0,</math> then the equation has the real root\n:<math>\\sqrt[3]{-\\frac q2+\\sqrt{\\frac{q^2}4+\\frac{p^3}{27}}} +\\sqrt[3]{-\\frac q2-\\sqrt{\\frac{q^2}4+\\frac{p^3}{27}}}.</math>\n\nSee {{slink||Derivation of the roots}}, below, for several methods for getting this result.\n\nAs shown in {{slink||Nature of the roots}}, the two other roots are non-real [[complex conjugate]] numbers, in this case. It was later shown (Cardano did not know [[complex number]]s) that the two other roots are obtained by multiplying one of the cube root by the [[primitive root of unity|primitive cube root of unity]] <math>\\frac{-1+i\\sqrt 3} 2,</math> and the other cube root by <math>\\frac{-1-i\\sqrt 3} 2.</math>\n\nIf <math>4p^3+27q^2 < 0,</math> there are three real roots, but [[Galois theory]] allows proving that they cannot be expressed by an [[algebraic expression]] involving only real numbers. Therefore, the equation cannot be solved in this case with the knowledge of Cardano's time. This case has thus been called ''[[casus irreducibilis]]'', meaning ''irreducible case'' in Latin.\n\nIn ''casus irreducibilis'', Cardano's formula can still be used, but some care is needed in the use cube roots. A first method is to define the symbols <math>\\sqrt{{~}^{~}}</math> and <math>\\sqrt[3]{{~}^{~}}</math> as representing the [[principal value]]s of the root function (that is the root that has the largest real part). With this convention Cardano's formula for the three roots remains valid, but is not purely algebraic, as the definition of a principal part is not purely algebraic, since it involves inequalities for comparing real parts. Also, the use of principal cube root may give a wrong result if the coefficients are non-real complex numbers. Moreover, if the coefficients belong to another [[field (mathematics)|field]], the principal cube root is not defined in general.\n\nThe second way for making Cardano's formula always correct, is to remark that the product of the two cube roots must be {{math|\u2013''p'' / 3}}. It results that a root of the equation is \n:<math>C-\\frac p{3C}\\quad\\text{with}\\quad C=\\sqrt[3]{-\\frac q2+\\sqrt{\\frac{q^2}4+\\frac{p^3}{27}}}. </math>\nIn this formula, the symbols <math>\\sqrt{{~}^{~}}</math> and <math>\\sqrt[3]{{~}^{~}}</math> denote any square root and any cube root. The other roots of the equation are obtained either by changing of cube root or, equivalently, by multiplying the cube root by a primitive cube root of the unity, that is <math>\\textstyle \\frac{-1\\pm \\sqrt{-3}}2.</math>\n\nThis formula for the roots is always correct except when {{math|1=''p'' = ''q'' = 0}}, under the condition, if {{math|1=''q'' = 0}}, of chosing the square root for having {{math|''C'' \u2260 0}}. However, the formula is useless in these cases as the roots can be expressed without any cube root. Similarly, the formula is also useless in the other cases where no cube root is needed, that is when <math>4p^3+27q^2=0</math> and when the cubic polynomial is not [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]].\n\nThis formula is also correct when {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} belong to any [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] other than 2 or 3.\n\n==General cubic formula==\n\nA ''cubic formula'' for the roots of the general cubic equation (with {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}})\n:<math>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0</math>\ncan be deduced from every variant of Cardano's formula by reduction to a [[#Depressed cubic|depressed cubic]]. The variant that is presented here is valid not only for real coefficients, but also for coefficients {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''}} belonging to any [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] different of 2 and 3.\n\nThe formula being rather complicated, it is worth splitting it in smaller formulas.\n\nLet\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\Delta_0 &= b^2 - 3ac,\\\\\n\\Delta_1 &= 2b^3 - 9abc + 27a^2d,\n\\end{align}</math>\nand \n:<math>C = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{\\Delta_1 \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta_1^2 - 4 \\Delta_0^3}}2},</math>\nwhere the symbols <math>\\sqrt{{~}^{~}}</math> and <math>\\sqrt[3]{{~}^{~}}</math> denote any square root and any cube root, respectively. The sign \"{{math|\u00b1}}\" before the square root is either \"{{math|+}}\" or \"{{math|\u2013}}\"; the choice is almost arbitrary, and changing it amounts to change of square root. However, if one choice leads to {{math|1=''C'' = 0}}, the other sign must be selected.\nThen,  one of the roots is\n:<math>x = - \\frac{1}{3a}\\left(b+C+\\frac{\\Delta_0}{C}\\right)\\text{.}</math>\n\nThe other two roots can be obtained by changing the choice of the cube root in the definition of {{mvar|C}}, or, equivalently by multiplying {{math|C}} by a [[primitive root of unity|primitive cube root of unity]], that is {{math|{{sfrac|\u20131 \u00b1 {{sqrt|\u20133}}|2}}}}. In other words, the three roots are \n:<math>x_k = - \\frac{1}{3a}\\left(b+\\xi^kC+\\frac{\\Delta_0}{\\xi^kC}\\right), \\qquad k \\in \\{0,1,2\\} \\text{,}</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03be'' {{=}} {{sfrac|\u20131 + {{sqrt|\u20133}}|2}}}}.\n\nAs for the special case of a depressed cubic, this formula applies but is useless when the roots can be expressed without cube roots.\n\n==Trigonometric and hyperbolic solutions==<!-- linked from redirect [[Chebyshev cube root]] -->\n\n===Trigonometric solution for three real roots===\n\nWhen a cubic equation with real coefficients has three real roots, the formulas expressing these roots in terms of radicals involve complex numbers. [[Galois theory]] allows proving that when the three roots are real, and none is rational (''[[casus irreducibilis]]''), one cannot express the roots in terms of real radicals.

This shift moves the point of inflection and the centre of the circle onto the {{mvar|y}}-axis. Consequently, the roots of the equation in {{mvar|t}} sum to zero.\n\n===One real complex root===\n\n====In the Cartesian plane====\n[[File:Graphical interpretation of the complex roots of cubic equation.svg|thumb|right|300px|The slope of line RA is twice that of RH.

There is an interesting geometrical relationship among all these roots.\n\nThe points in the complex plane representing the three roots serve as the vertices of an isosceles triangle. (The triangle is isosceles because one root is on the horizontal (real) axis and the other two roots, being complex conjugates, appear symmetrically above and below the real axis.) [[Marden's theorem]] says that the points representing the roots of the derivative of the cubic are the [[focus (geometry)|foci]] of the [[Steiner inellipse]] of the triangle\u2014the unique ellipse that is tangent to the triangle at the midpoints of its sides. If the angle at the vertex on the real axis is less than {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}}} then the major axis of the ellipse lies on the real axis, as do its foci and hence the roots of the derivative. If that angle is greater than {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}}}, the major axis is vertical and its foci, the roots of the derivative, are complex conjugates. And if that angle is {{math|{{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}}}}, the triangle is equilateral, the Steiner inellipse is simply the triangle's incircle, its foci coincide with each other at the incenter, which lies on the real axis, and hence the derivative has duplicate real roots.\n\n==Galois group==\n\nGiven a cubic [[irreducible polynomial]] over a field {{mvar|k}} of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] different from 2 and 3, the [[Galois theory#Permutation group approach to Galois theory|Galois group]] over {{mvar|k}} is the group of the [[field automorphism]]s that fix {{mvar|k}} of the smallest extension of {{mvar|k}} ([[splitting field]]). As these automorphismes must permute the roots of the polynomials, this group is either the group {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}} of all six permutations of the three roots, or the group {{math|''A''<sub>3</sub>}} of the three circular permutations.\n\nThe discriminant {{math|\u0394}} of the cubic is the square of \n:<math>\\sqrt \\Delta =a^2(r_1-r_2)(r_1-r_3)(r_2-r_3),</math>\nwhere {{mvar|a}} is the leading coefficient of the cubic, and {{math|''r''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}} and {{math|''r''<sub>3</sub>}} are the three roots of the cubic. As <math>\\sqrt \\Delta</math> changes of sign if two roots are exchanged, <math>\\sqrt \\Delta</math> is fixed by the Galois group only if the Galois group is \n{{math|''A''<sub>3</sub>}}. In other words, the Galois group is {{math|''A''<sub>3</sub>}} if and only if the discriminant is the square of an element of {{mvar|k}}.\n\nAs most integers are not squares, when working over the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of the [[rational number]]s, the Galois group of most irreducible cubic polynomials is the group {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}} with six elements. An example of a Galois group {{math|''A''<sub>3</sub>}} with three elements is given by {{math|''p''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 3''x'' \u2212 1}}, whose discriminant is {{math|81 {{=}} 9<sup>2</sup >}}.\n\n==Derivation of the roots==\n\nThis section regroup several methods for deriving [[#Cardano's formula|Cardano's formula]].\n\n===Cardano's method===\nThis method is due to [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]], but is named after [[Gerolamo Cardano]] who first published it in his book [[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|''Ars Magna'']] (1545).\n\nThis method applies to a depressed cubic {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}. The idea is to introduce two variables {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} such that {{math|''u'' + ''v'' {{=}} ''t''}} and to substitute this in the depressed cubic, giving\n:<math>u^3 + v^3 + (3uv + p)(u+v)+ q= 0.</math>\n\nAt this point Cardano imposed the condition {{math|3''uv'' + ''p'' {{=}} 0}}. This removes the third term in previous  equality, leading to the system of equations\n:<math>\\begin{align}u^3 + v^3&=-q \\\\ uv&=-\\frac p3.\\end{align}</math>\n\nKnowing the sum and the product of {{math|''u''<sup>3</sup>}} and {{math|''v''<sup>3</sup>}}, one deduces that they are the two solutions of the [[quadratic equation]] \n:<math>(x - u^3)(x - v^3) = x^2 - (u^3 + v^3)x + u^3v^3 = x^2 - (u^3 + v^3)x + (uv)^3 = 0,</math> \nso\n:<math>x^2 + qx -\\frac {p^3}{27}=0,</math>\nThe discriminant of this equation is <math>\\Delta = q^2 + \\frac{4p^3}{27}</math>, and assuming it is positive, real solutions to this equations are (after folding division by 4 under the square root):\n:<math>-\\frac q2 \\pm \\sqrt {\\frac {q^2}{4} +\\frac {p^3}{27}}.</math>\nSo (without loss of generality in choosing u or v):\n:<math>u = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac q2 + \\sqrt {\\frac {q^2}{4} +\\frac {p^3}{27}}}.</math>\n:<math>v = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac q2 - \\sqrt {\\frac {q^2}{4} +\\frac {p^3}{27}}}.</math>\nAs {{math|''u'' + ''v'' {{=}} ''t''}}, the sum of the cube roots of these solutions is a root if the equation. That is \n:<math>t=\\sqrt[3]{-{q\\over 2}+\\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}} +\\sqrt[3]{-{q\\over 2}-\\sqrt{{q^{2}\\over 4}+{p^{3}\\over 27}}}</math>\nis a root of the equation; this is Cardano's formula.\n\nThis works well when <math>4p^3+27q^2 > 0,</math> but, if <math>4p^3+27q^2 < 0,</math> the square root appearing in the formula is not real. As a [[complex number]] has three cube roots, using Cardano's formula without care would provide nine roots, while a cubic equation cannot have more three roots. This has been clarified first by [[Rafael Bombelli]] in his book ''L'Algebra'' (1572). The solution is to use the fact that {{math|1=''uv'' = {{sfrac|\u2013''p''|3}}}}, that is {{math|1=''v'' = {{sfrac|\u2013''p''|3''u''}}}}. This means that only one cube root need to be computed, and leads to the second formula given in {{slink||Cardano's formula}}.\n\nThe other roots of the equation can be obtained by changing of cube root, or, equivalently, by multiplying the cube root by each of the two [[primitive root of unity|primitive cube roots of unity]], which are <math>\\frac {-1\\pm \\sqrt{-3}}2.</math>\n\n=== Vieta's substitution ===\nVieta's substitution is a method introduced by [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]] (Vieta is his Latin name) in a text published posthumously in 1615, which provides directly the second formula of {{slink||Cardano's method}}, and avoids the problem of computing two different cube roots.<ref>{{Citation|last = van der Waerden|first = Bartel Leenert|author-link = Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|title = A History of Algebra: From al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b to Emmy Noether|publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|year = 1985|chapter = From Vi\u00e8te to Descartes|isbn = 3-540-13610-X}}</ref>\n\nStarting from the depressed cubic {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}, Vieta's substitution is {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''w'' \u2013 {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''}}}}.<ref>More precisely, Vieta introduced a new variable {{mvar|w}} and imposed the condition {{math|''w''(''t'' + ''w'') {{=}} {{sfrac|''p''|3}}}}. This is equivalent with the substitution {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''}} \u2013 ''w''}}, and differs from the substitution that is used here only by a change of sign of {{mvar|w}}. This change of sign allows getting directly the formulas of {{slink||Cardano's formula}}.</ref>\n\nThe substitution {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''w'' \u2013 {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''}}}} transforms the depressed cubic into\n:<math>w^3+q-\\frac{p^3}{27w^3}=0.</math>\n\nMultiplying by {{math|''w''<sup>3</sup>}}, one gets a quadratic equation in {{mvar|w{{sup|3}}}}:\n:<math>(w^3)^2+q(w^3)-\\frac{p^3}{27}=0.</math>\n\nLet \n:<math>W=-\\frac q 2\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{p^3}{27} + \\frac {q^2} 4}</math> \nbe any nonzero root of this quadratic equation. If {{math|''w''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{math|''w''<sub>2</sub>}} and {{math|''w''<sub>3</sub>}} are the three [[cube root]]s of {{mvar|W}}, then the roots of the original depressed cubic are {{math|''w''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''<sub>1</sub>}}}}, {{math|''w''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''<sub>2</sub>}}}}, and {{math|''w''<sub>3</sub> \u2212 {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''<sub>3</sub>}}}}.  The other   root of the quadratic equation is <math>\\textstyle -\\frac {p^3}{27W}.</math> This implies that changing the sign of the square root exchanges {{math|''w''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|\u2212 {{sfrac|''p''|3''w''<sub>''i''</sub>}}}} for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, 2, 3}}, and therefore does not change the roots. This method only fails when both roots of the quadratic equation are zero, that is when {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''q'' {{=}} 0}}, in which case the only root of the depressed cubic is {{math|0}}.\n\n===Lagrange's method===\nIn his paper ''R\u00e9flexions sur la r\u00e9solution alg\u00e9brique des \u00e9quations'' (\"Thoughts on the algebraic solving of equations\"),<ref>{{Citation|last = Lagrange|first = Joseph-Louis|author-link = Joseph Louis Lagrange|chapter = R\u00e9flexions sur la r\u00e9solution alg\u00e9brique des \u00e9quations|title = \u0152uvres de Lagrange|editor-last = Serret|editor-first = Joseph-Alfred|editor-link = Joseph Alfred Serret|year = 1869|origyear = 1771|publisher = Gauthier-Villars|pages = 205\u2013421|volume = III}}</ref> [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] introduced a new method to solve equations of low degree in a uniform way, with the hope that he could generalize it for higher degrees.

This has been proved later, and named [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]. Nevertheless, the modern methods for solving solvable quintic equations are mainly based on Lagrange's method.<ref name=\"laz\" />\n\nIn the case of cubic equations, Lagrange's method gives the same solution as Cardano's. Lagrange's method can be applied directly to the general cubic equation  {{math|''ax''<sup>3</sup> + ''bx''<sup>2</sup> + ''cx'' + ''d'' {{=}} 0}}, but the computation is simpler with the depressed cubic equation, {{math|''t''<sup>3</sup> + ''pt'' + ''q'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nLagrange's main idea was to work with the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of the roots instead with the roots themselves. More precisely, let {{mvar|\u03be}} be a [[primitive root of unity|primitive third root of unity]], that is a number such that {{math|''\u03be''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''\u03be''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03be'' + 1 {{=}} 0}} (when working in the space of [[complex number]]s, one has <math>\\textstyle \\xi=\\frac{-1\\pm i\\sqrt 3}2=e^{2i\\pi/3},</math> but this complex interpretation is not used here). Denoting {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} the three roots of the cubic equation to be solved, let\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ns_0 &= x_0 + x_1 + x_2,\\\\\ns_1 &= x_0 + \\xi x_1 + \\xi^2 x_2,\\\\\ns_2 &= x_0 + \\xi^2 x_1 + \\xi x_2,\n\\end{align}</math>\nbe the discrete Fourier transform of the roots. If {{math|''s''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} are known, the roots may be recovered from them with the inverse Fourier transform consisting of inverting this linear transformation; that is,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx_0 &= \\tfrac13(s_0 + s_1 + s_2),\\\\\nx_1 &= \\tfrac13(s_0 + \\xi^2 s_1 + \\xi s_2),\\\\\nx_2 &= \\tfrac13(s_0 + \\xi s_1 + \\xi ^2 s_2).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy [[Vieta's formulas]], {{math|''s''<sub>0</sub>}} is known to be zero in the case of a depressed cubic, and {{math|\u2212{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}} for the general cubic. So, only {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} need to be computed. They are not [[symmetric polynomial|symmetric functions]] of the roots (exchanging {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} exchanges also {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}}), but some simple symmetric functions of {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} are also symmetric in the roots of the cubic equation to be solved. Thus these symmetric functions can be expressed in terms of the (known) coefficients of the original cubic, and this allows eventually  expressing the {{mvar|s{{sub|i}}}} as roots of a polynomial with known coefficients.\n\nIn the case of a cubic equation, {{math|1=''P''=''s''<sub>1</sub>''s''<sub>2</sub>}}, and {{math|1=''S''=''s''<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + ''s''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>}} are such symmetric polynomials (see below). It follows that {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>}} are the two roots of the quadratic equation {{math|''z''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''Sz'' + ''P''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 0}}. Thus the resolution of the equation may be finished exactly as with Cardano's method, with {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} in place of {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}.\n\nIn the case of the depressed cubic, one has {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|1|3}}(''s''<sub>1</sub> + ''s''<sub>2</sub>)}} and {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub>''s''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} \u22123''p''}}, while in Cardano's method we have set {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''u'' + ''v''}} and {{math|''uv'' {{=}} \u2212{{sfrac|1|3}}''p''}}. Thus we have, up to the exchange of {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}, {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 3''u''}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} 3''v''}} . In other words, in this case, Cardano's method and Lagrange's method compute exactly the same things, up to a factor of three in the auxiliary variables, the main difference being that Lagrange's method explains why these auxiliary variables appear in the problem.\n\n====Computation of {{mvar|S}} and {{mvar|P}}====\n\nA straightforward computation using the relations {{math|''\u03be''<sup>3</sup> {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''\u03be''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03be'' + 1 {{=}} 0}} gives \n:<math>\\begin{align}\nP&=s_1s_2=x_0^2+x_1^2+x_2^2-(x_0x_1+x_1x_2+x_2x_0),\\\\\nS&=s_1^3+s_2^3=2(x_0^3+x_1^3+x_2^3)-3(x_0^2x_1+x_1^2x_2+x_2^2x_0+x_0x_1^2+x_1x_2^2+x_2x_0^2)+12x_0x_1x_2.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThis shows that {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}} are symmetric functions of the roots.

The roots of the [[first derivative]] of this cubic are the complex coordinates of those foci.\n* The [[area]] of a regular [[heptagon]] can be expressed in terms of the roots of a cubic. Further, the ratios of the long diagonal to the side, the side to the short diagonal, and the negative of the short diagonal to the long diagonal all satisfy a particular cubic equation. In addition, the ratio of the [[inradius]] to the [[circumradius]] of a [[heptagonal triangle]] is one of the solutions of a cubic equation. The values of trigonometric functions of angles related to <math>2\\pi/7</math> satisfy cubic equations.\n* Given the cosine (or other trigonometric function) of an arbitrary angle, the cosine of [[angle trisection|one-third of that angle]] is one of the roots of a cubic.\n* The solution of the general [[quartic equation]] relies on the solution of its [[resolvent cubic]].\n* The [[eigenvalue]]s of a 3\u00d73 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] are the roots of a cubic polynomial which is the [[characteristic polynomial]] of the matrix.\n* The [[characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic equation]] of a third-order constant coeffecients [[linear differential equation]] or [[difference equation]] is a cubic equation.\n* Intersection points of cubic [[B\u00e9zier curve]] and straight line can be computed using direct cubic equation representing B\u00e9zier curve.\n\n=== In other sciences ===\n* In [[analytical chemistry]], the [[Charlot equation]], which can be used to find the pH of [[buffer solution]]s, can be solved using a cubic equation.\n* In [[chemical engineering]] and [[thermodynamics]], [[equation of state#Cubic equations of state|equations of state]] (which relate pressure, volume, and temperature of a substances) are cubic in the volume.\n* [[kinematics|Kinematic equations]] involving changing [[jerk (physics)|rates of acceleration]] are cubic.\n* The speed of seismic Rayleigh waves is a solution of the [[Rayleigh wave#Rayleigh wave dispersion|Rayleigh wave]] cubic equation.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation\n |first= Lucye\n |last= Guilbeau\n |year= 1930\n |title= The History of the Solution of the Cubic Equation\n |journal= Mathematics News Letter\n |volume= 5\n |issue= 4\n |pages= 8&ndash;12\n |doi=10.2307/3027812\n |jstor= 3027812}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Citation\n |first= W.

He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his fiefs at Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival.<ref name=\"Austin2017\">{{cite book|author=Greta Austin|title=Shaping Church Law Around the Year 1000: The Decretum of Burchard of Worms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT4|date=15 May 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-90055-3|pages=4\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]] the Elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year.

The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}<ref name=brit>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Conrad-II |title=  Conrad II Holy Roman emperor | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=   |author=Peter Munz   |accessdate= April 2, 2020  }}</ref>\n\nConrad II's hopes to obtain his own duchy failed, but the marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017.

The dukes of Saxony and Lorraine and his cousin Conrad of Carinthia opposed his rule. In order to strengthen his position, Conrad and Gisela embarked on a royal tour. At [[Augsburg]] Conrad received the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]] and at [[Strasbourg]] he acquired the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]]. Both men were brothers of former emperor Henry II and Conrad appointed them to highest office at his court. After visiting Cologne Conrad stopped at [[Aachen]], where he as a successor of the empire's founder [[Charlemagne]], announced to continue the tradition of claim and royal rule of [[East Francia]]. The princes of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both were daughters of the former [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad needed to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' as he had assumed the German throne. The decade-old unsettled dispute on who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed.

Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (\"Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom\") of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.<ref name=\"Stock1983\">{{cite book|author=Brian Stock|title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10227-9}}</ref> Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction. The Pavian embassy returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled a large army of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Conrad was crowned as Emperor on March 26, 1027, by [[Pope John XIX]].]]\nOn March 26, 1027, [[Pope John XIX]] crowned Conrad and his wife Gisela as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and Empress, respectively, in [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=102}} The event lasted seven days and was attended by Conrad's son and heir [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], [[Cnut the Great|Cnut the Great, King of England, Denmark and Norway]], [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]] and around 70 senior clerics, including the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, Trier, Magdeburg, Salzburg, Milan, and Ravenna.{{sfn|Heer|1968|p=51}} Rudolph of Burgundy's attendance suggested surprisingly good relations between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the festivities a power struggle between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna ensued and was settled in favor of Milan. Subsequently, Conrad left Rome and toured south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the Southern Italian principalities of [[Principality of Capua|Capua]] and [[Principality of Salerno|Salerno]] and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees, that outlined the reorganisation of the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the explicit objective to bring the [[Patriarchate of Venice]] under imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the emperor addressed the matter acknowledging the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]] superior to the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Aquileian [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him patriarch in 1020. Conrad's action placed the patriarchate at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn May 1027 Conrad returned to Germany in order to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad asserted his right to appoint the new [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He made the unprecedented decision of choosing his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], ignoring several suitable candidates who held valid claims to the fief.\n\nThe young prince assumed Bavarian rule on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree, that all imperial property in the duchy must be documented. This required the various counts and bishops to list and report all imperial property in their domains, castles and abbeys. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, who even claimed that Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property she had inherited from her deceased husband Emperor Henry II) belonged to him. These dubious claims to property and the excessive promotion of imperial authority over the ducal and clerical affairs throughout Bavaria caused, unsurprisingly, new tension between him and the German aristocracy.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}<ref name=brit/>\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|240px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\n[[File:Adalbero of Eppenstein, Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of Verona.jpg|thumb|Emperor Conrad disapproved of [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero's]] increasingly indiscreet and quasi-independent rule of his estates [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona|Verona]], that compromised the stability at the crossroads of the empire]]\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The 'Imperial Church System' of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   |journal= The Journal of Ecclesiastical History|volume= 33|issue= 3|pages= 347\u2013374|doi= 10.1017/S0022046900026245| accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]].

The Empire and Poland endured peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Boles\u0142aw seized the opportunity of Henry's death in 1024 to disregard all peace agreements and consolidate his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself King at [[Easter]], April 25, 1025.

In preparation for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with King [[Cnut the Great|Cnut of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay beyond the Empire's northern border).

Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland.

When Mieszko had assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who had fled to the [[Kievan Rus]], east of Poland. Bezprym, with approval of Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as sovereign. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to [[Duchy of Bohemia|Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding of [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the sensible title ''\"king\"'' in favor of the traditional title ''\"duke\"'' and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The royal regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/102/4/1140/80981?redirectedFrom=fulltext |title= Medieval Russia 980\u20131584  |publisher= Oxford University Press | date= October 1, 1997 | author=Janet Martin    | accessdate= April 4, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nBezprym's reign, however, was short. His extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to conspire against him. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, which created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding a [[hoftag|diet]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland among Mieszko, Otto, and Detric, another half brother. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref>\n\nThe regulation was short-lived as in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took over the domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric and reunited the whole country in his hand. Though Mieszko regained his territory, he still was opposed by the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not adopt Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as King. Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to the Empire.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/><ref name=mie/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], that lasted from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and guaranteed protection against Polish aggression. Jaromir ruled only a small territory, however, as Poland had occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. During the following civil war, Mieszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Mieszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref><ref name=mie/>\n\nPoland did not stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Mieszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear at the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was a complete success, as Henry deposed Oldrich and restored his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne. Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] was appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich himself was imprisoned in Bavaria, but in 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.<ref name=\"Wolverton2012\">{{cite book|author=Lisa Wolverton|title=Hastening Toward Prague: Power and Society in the Medieval Czech Lands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FeFACISbhCgC&pg=PP6|date=9 October 2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0422-3|pages=6\u2013}}</ref> Oldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son Bretislaus. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is assumed Bretislaus had supported Jaromir over his father. However, Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then confirmed as the new Duke of Bohemia by emperor Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=227}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith emperor Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary.

Conrad launched an invasion into Hungary, but was forced to retreat when the Hungarians had successfully used [[scorched earth tactics]]. Conrad left the matters in Hungary to his son Henry, so he was free to leave and address the problem with his stepson [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]], the deposed [[Duke of Swabia]]. Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by bestowing titles of eastern Bavarian lands in between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] to the Hungarian nobility. Hungary and the Empire remained at peace from 1031 through to Henry's own reign as Emperor in 1040.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149-150}}\n\n===Conquest of Burgundy===\nAs in 1016 King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] was left without a male heir, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] seized the opportunity and forced King Rudolph III to name him - Henry his royal successor.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=16}} Henry II, the son of Rudolph's sister [[Gisela of Burgundy]] was his nephew, and his closest living male relative. However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II. In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}}\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and could easily block foreign invasions.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=40}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Conrad II et prince imp\u00e9rial, vitrail roman, Cath\u00e9drale de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Conrad II, 12th-century stained glass window, [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Image:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|280px|Salian family tree]]\n\nConrad formally confirmed the popular [[legal]] traditions of [[Saxony]] and issued new constitutions for [[Lombardy]]. In 1028 at [[Aachen]], he had his son Henry elected and anointed king of [[Germany]].

Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\n-->\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers.

Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/><ref name=brit/>\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|150px|Conrad II's tomb in the [[Speyer Cathedral]]]]\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops.

{{nowrap|'''Conrad the Elder'''}} and {{nowrap|'''Conrad the Salic'''}}, was [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1027 until his death in 1039. The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.\n\nThe son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}<ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\nConrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role and [[Imperial Church System|organisation of the Church]] and the status and affairs of [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]]. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his fiefs at Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival.<ref name=\"Austin2017\">{{cite book|author=Greta Austin|title=Shaping Church Law Around the Year 1000: The Decretum of Burchard of Worms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT4|date=15 May 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-90055-3|pages=4\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]] the Elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela had married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Through this marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] upon the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}<ref name=brit>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Conrad-II |title=  Conrad II Holy Roman emperor | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=   |author=Peter Munz   |accessdate= April 2, 2020  }}</ref>\n\nConrad II's hopes to obtain his own duchy failed, but the marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017.

The dukes of Saxony and Lorraine and his cousin Conrad of Carinthia opposed his rule. In order to strengthen his position, Conrad and Gisela embarked on a royal tour. At [[Augsburg]] Conrad received the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]] and at [[Strasbourg]] he acquired the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]]. Both men were brothers of former emperor Henry II and Conrad appointed them to highest office at his court. After visiting Cologne Conrad stopped at [[Aachen]], where he as a successor of the empire's founder [[Charlemagne]], announced to continue the tradition of claim and royal rule of [[East Francia]]. The princes of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both were daughters of the former [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad needed to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' as he had assumed the German throne. The decade-old unsettled dispute on who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed. Only a third synod in 1030 solved the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04818-5|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his royal tour at Augsburg, Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] engaged into an argument, that although not entirely clear, was related to the younger Conrad's demands of yet unpaid compensation, king Conrad had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election.

The local merchants and aristocrats demanded the greatest possible autonomy from imperial control.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313 |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the ecclesiastical mission, a party of noblemen from [[Pavia]] traveled north to meet Conrad. According to Wipo of Burgundy, the Italian kingship was not compatible with the German throne. Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity. The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (\"Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom\") of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.<ref name=\"Stock1983\">{{cite book|author=Brian Stock|title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10227-9}}</ref> Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction. The Pavian embassy returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled a large army of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Conrad was crowned as Emperor on March 26, 1027, by [[Pope John XIX]].]]\nOn March 26, 1027, [[Pope John XIX]] crowned Conrad and his wife Gisela as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and Empress, respectively, in [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=102}} The event lasted seven days and was attended by Conrad's son and heir [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], [[Cnut the Great|Cnut the Great, King of England, Denmark and Norway]], [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]] and around 70 senior clerics, including the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, Trier, Magdeburg, Salzburg, Milan, and Ravenna.{{sfn|Heer|1968|p=51}} Rudolph of Burgundy's attendance suggested surprisingly good relations between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the festivities a power struggle between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna ensued and was settled in favor of Milan. Subsequently Conrad left Rome and toured south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the Southern Italian principalities of [[Principality of Capua|Capua]] and [[Principality of Salerno|Salerno]] and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees, that outlined the reorganisation of the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the explicit objective to bring the [[Patriarchate of Venice]] under imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the emperor addressed the matter acknowledging the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]] superior to the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Aquileian [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him patriarch in 1020. Conrad's action placed the patriarchate at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn May 1027 Conrad returned to Germany in order to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad asserted his right to appoint the new [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He made the unprecedented decision of chosing his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], ignoring several suitable candidates who held valid claims to the fief.\n\nThe young prince assumed Bavarian rule on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree, that all imperial property in the duchy must be documented. This required the various counts and bishops to list and report all imperial property in their domains, castles and abbeys. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, who even claimed that Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property she had inherited from her deceased husband Emperor Henry II) belonged to him. These dubious claims to property and the excessive promotion of imperial authority over the ducal and clerical affairs throughout Bavaria caused, unsurprisingly, new tension between him and the German aristocracy.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}<ref name=brit/>\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|240px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\n[[File:Adalbero of Eppenstein, Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of Verona.jpg|thumb|Emperor Conrad disapproved of [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero's]] increasingly indiscreet and quasi-independent rule of his estates [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona|Verona]], that compromized the stability at the crossroads of the empire]]\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The 'Imperial Church System' of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   |journal= The Journal of Ecclesiastical History|volume= 33|issue= 3|pages= 347\u2013374|doi= 10.1017/S0022046900026245| accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]].

The Empire and Poland endured peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Boles\u0142aw seized the opportunity of Henry's death in 1024 to disregard all peace agreements and consolidate his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself King at [[Easter]], April 25, 1025.

In preparation for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with King [[Cnut the Great|Cnut of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay beyond the Empire's northern border).

Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland.

When Mieszko had assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who had fled to the [[Kievan Rus]], east of Poland. Bezprym, with approval of Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as sovereign. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to [[Duchy of Bohemia|Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding of [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the sensible title ''\"king\"'' in favor of the traditional title ''\"duke\"'' and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The royal regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/102/4/1140/80981?redirectedFrom=fulltext |title= Medieval Russia 980\u20131584  |publisher= Oxford University Press | date= October 1, 1997 | author=Janet Martin    | accessdate= April 4, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nBezprym's reign, however, was short. His extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to conspire against him. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, which created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding a [[hoftag|diet]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland among Mieszko, Otto, and Detric, another half brother. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref>\n\nThe regulation was short-lived as in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took over the domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric and reunited the whole country in his hand. Though Mieszko regained his territory, he still was opposed by the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not adopt Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as King. Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to the Empire.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/><ref name=mie/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], that lasted from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and guaranteed protection against Polish aggression. Jaromir ruled only a small territory, however, as Poland had occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. During the following civil war, Mieszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Mieszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref><ref name=mie/>\n\nPoland did not stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Mieszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear at the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was a complete success, as Henry deposed Oldrich and restored his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne. Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] was appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich himself was imprisoned in Bavaria, but in 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.<ref name=\"Wolverton2012\">{{cite book|author=Lisa Wolverton|title=Hastening Toward Prague: Power and Society in the Medieval Czech Lands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FeFACISbhCgC&pg=PP6|date=9 October 2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0422-3|pages=6\u2013}}</ref> Oldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son Bretislaus. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is assumed Bretislaus had supported Jaromir over his father. However, Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then confirmed as the new Duke of Bohemia by emperor Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=227}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith emperor Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary.

Conrad launched an invasion into Hungary, but was forced to retreat when the Hungarians had successfully used [[scorched earth tactics]]. Conrad left the matters in Hungary to his son Henry, so he was free to leave and address the problem with his stepson [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]], the deposed [[Duke of Swabia]]. Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by bestowing titles of eastern Bavarian lands in between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] to the Hungarian nobility. Hungary and the Empire remained at peace from 1031 through to Henry's own reign as Emperor in 1040.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149-150}}\n\n===Conquest of Burgundy===\nAs in 1016 King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] was left without a male heir, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] seized the opportunity and forced King Rudolph III to name him - Henry his royal successor.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=16}} Henry II, the son of Rudolph's sister [[Gisela of Burgundy]] was his nephew, and his closest living male relative. However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II. In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}}\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and could easily block foreign invasions.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=40}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Conrad II et prince imp\u00e9rial, vitrail roman, Cath\u00e9drale de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Conrad II, 12th-century stained glass window, [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Image:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|280px|Salian family tree]]\n\nConrad formally confirmed the popular [[legal]] traditions of [[Saxony]] and issued new constitutions for [[Lombardy]]. In 1028 at [[Aachen]], he had his son Henry elected and anointed king of [[Germany]].

Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\n-->\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers.

Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/><ref name=brit/>\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|150px|Conrad II's tomb in the [[Speyer Cathedral]]]]\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops.
