For this reason, it may be helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]].

For example, Weller (2013) defines open pedagogy as follows: \"Open pedagogy makes use of this abundant, open content (such as open educational resources, videos, podcasts), but also places an emphasis on the network and the learner's connections within this\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5334/2013-15|title = The Battle for Open - a perspective|journal = Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume = 2013|issue = 3|pages = 15|year = 2013|last1 = Weller|first1 = Martin|doi-access = free}}</ref> Open educational practices are defined as, for example, \u201ca set of activities around instructional design and implementation of events and processes intended to support learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual setting. (The Open Educational Quality Initiative<ref>https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-25907/OPALReport2011_Beyond_OER.pdf</ref>). Wiley & Hilton (2018)<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> proposed a new term called \"OER-enabled pedagogy\", which is defined as \"the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER\", emphasizing the 5R permissions enabled by the use of open licenses.\n\n== Costs ==\nOne of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.<ref>Bliss, T.

Retrieved from http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1153</ref> While OER seem well placed to bring down total expenditures, they are not cost-free. New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency. Upfront costs in developing the OER infrastructure can be expensive, such as building the OER infrastructure. Butcher and Hoosen<ref>Butcher, N., & Hoosen, S. (2012).

Retrieved from http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=421</ref> noted that \u201ca key argument put forward by those who have written about the potential benefits of OER relates to its potential for saving cost or, at least, creating significant economic efficiencies. However, to date there has been limited presentation of concrete data to back up this assertion, which reduces the effectiveness of such arguments and opens the OER movement to justified academic criticism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Institutional support==\nA large part of the early work on open educational resources was funded by universities and foundations such as the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]],<ref name=\"guttenplan\" /> which was the main financial supporter of open educational resources in the early years and has spent more than $110 million in the 2002 to 2010 period, of which more than $14 million went to [[MIT OpenCourseWare|MIT]].<ref name=\"hafner\" /> The [[Shuttleworth Foundation]], which focuses on projects concerning collaborative content creation, has contributed as well.

For this reason, it may be as helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]].

For example, Weller (2013) defines open pedagogy as follows: \"Open pedagogy makes use of this abundant, open content (such as open educational resources, videos, podcasts), but also places an emphasis on the network and the learner's connections within this\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5334/2013-15|title = The Battle for Open - a perspective|journal = Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume = 2013|issue = 3|pages = 15|year = 2013|last1 = Weller|first1 = Martin|doi-access = free}}</ref> Open educational practices are defined as, for example, \u201ca set of activities around instructional design and implementation of events and processes intended to support learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual setting. (The Open Educational Quality Initiative<ref>https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-25907/OPALReport2011_Beyond_OER.pdf</ref>). Wiley & Hilton (2018)<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> proposed a new term called \"OER-enabled pedagogy\", which is defined as \"the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER\", emphasizing the 5R permissions enabled by the use of open licenses.\n\n== Costs ==\nOne of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.<ref>Bliss, T.

Retrieved from http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1153</ref> While OER seem well placed to bring down total expenditures, they are not cost-free. New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency. Upfront costs in developing the OER infrastructure can be expensive, such as building the OER infrastructure. Butcher and Hoosen<ref>Butcher, N., & Hoosen, S. (2012).

Retrieved from http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=421</ref> noted that \u201ca key argument put forward by those who have written about the potential benefits of OER relates to its potential for saving cost or, at least, creating significant economic efficiencies. However, to date there has been limited presentation of concrete data to back up this assertion, which reduces the effectiveness of such arguments and opens the OER movement to justified academic criticism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Institutional support==\nA large part of the early work on open educational resources was funded by universities and foundations such as the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]],<ref name=\"guttenplan\" /> which was the main financial supporter of open educational resources in the early years and has spent more than $110 million in the 2002 to 2010 period, of which more than $14 million went to [[MIT OpenCourseWare|MIT]].<ref name=\"hafner\" /> The [[Shuttleworth Foundation]], which focuses on projects concerning collaborative content creation, has contributed as well.
