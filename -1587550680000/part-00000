The show was developed by [[Ronald D. Moore]] and executive produced by Moore and [[David Eick]] as a [[reboot (fiction)|re-imagining]] of the 1978 [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|''Battlestar Galactica'']] television series created by [[Glen A. Larson]]. The pilot for the series first aired as a [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|three-hour miniseries]] (comprising four broadcast hours in two parts) in December 2003 on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]], which was then followed by four regular seasons, ending its run on March 20, 2009. The cast includes [[Edward James Olmos]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Katee Sackhoff]], [[Jamie Bamber]], [[James Callis]], [[Tricia Helfer]], and [[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]].\n\nThe series garnered a wide range of critical acclaim both at the time of its run and in the years since, including a [[Peabody Award]], the [[Television Critics Association]]'s Program of the Year Award, a placement inside ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time,<ref name=\"top100\">{{cite news |author=Poniewozik, James |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2007/09/06/the-100-best-tv-shows-of-all-time/slide/battlestar-galactica-2/ |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=The 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |date=September 6, 2007}}</ref> and 19 Emmy nominations for its writing, directing, costume design, visual effects, sound mixing, and sound editing, with three Emmy wins (visual effects and sound editing).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.emmys.com/shows/battlestar-galactica |title=Battlestar Galactica |website=Emmys.com |accessdate=May 20, 2018}}</ref> In 2019, ''[[The New York Times]]'' placed the show on its list of \"The 20 Best TV Dramas Since ''[[The Sopranos]]''\", a 20-year period many critics call \"[[Golden Age of Television (2000s\u2013present)|the golden age of television]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/arts/television/best-drama-series.html |title=The 20 Best TV Dramas Since 'The Sopranos' |work=The New York Times |date=January 10, 2019 |accessdate=March 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Battlestar Galactica'' is set in a distant star system, where a civilization of humans lives on a group of planets known as the [[Twelve Colonies]]. In the past, the Colonies had been at war with an android race of their own creation, known as the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]]. With the unwitting help of a human scientist named [[Gaius Baltar]], the Cylons launch a sudden [[sneak attack]] on the Colonies, laying waste to the planets and devastating their populations. Out of a population numbering in the billions, only approximately 50,000 humans survive, most of whom were aboard civilian ships that avoided destruction. Of all the Colonial Fleet, the eponymous [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Battlestar ''Galactica'']] appears to be the only military capital ship that survived the attack. Under the leadership of Colonial Fleet officer [[William Adama|Commander William \"Bill\" Adama]] (Olmos) and now-President [[Laura Roslin]] (McDonnell), the ''Galactica'' and its crew take up the task of leading the small fugitive fleet of survivors into space in search of a fabled thirteenth colony known as [[Earth in science fiction#Battlestar Galactica|Earth]].\n\nThe series spawned the prequel [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series ''[[Caprica]]'', which aired for one season in 2010. Another spin-off, ''[[Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome]]'', was released in November 2012 as a [[web series]] of ten 10-minute episodes, and aired on February 10, 2013, on [[Syfy]] as a televised movie.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/battlestar-galactica-blood-chrome-premiere-386601 |title='Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome' to Premiere Online Before Debuting on TV |first=Philiana |last=Ng |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 5, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/12/26/exclusive-battlestar-galactica-blood-and-chrome-to-make-tv-premiere-sunday-february-10-on-syfy-726420/10128/ |title=Exclusive: \"Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome\" to Make TV Premiere Sunday, February 10 on Syfy |publisher=The Futon Critic |date=December 26, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Series overview ==\n{{Main|List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes}}\n{{:List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes}}\n\n''Battlestar Galactica'' continued from the 2003 miniseries to chronicle the journey of the last surviving humans from the [[Twelve Colonies of Kobol]], after their nuclear annihilation by the [[Cylon (re-imagining)|Cylons]]. The survivors are led by President [[Laura Roslin]] and Commander [[William Adama]] in a ragtag fleet of ships with the [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Battlestar ''Galactica'']], an old, but powerful warship, as its command ship. Pursued by Cylons intent on wiping out the remnants of the human race, the survivors travel across the galaxy looking for the fabled and long-lost \"thirteenth\" colony: [[Earth (Battlestar Galactica)|Earth]]. Unlike most [[space opera]] series, ''Battlestar Galactica'' has no [[Extraterrestrial life|humanoid aliens]] (the antagonists are man-made Cylon androids), the primary armaments used by both military forces utilize bullets, rail guns, and missiles instead of lasers, and the series intentionally avoids [[technobabble]].<ref name=nym080403>{{cite news |author=Everett Bogue |url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/04/how_to_convince_your_girlfrien.html |title=How to Convince Your Girlfriend (or Boyfriend) That 'Battlestar' Is Not 'Star Trek' |date=April 3, 2008 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=February 3, 2009}}</ref> Instead, most of the stories deal with the apocalyptic fallout of the destruction of the Twelve Colonies upon the survivors, and the moral choices they must make as they deal with the decline of the human race and their war with the Cylons. Stories also portray the concept of perpetuated cycles of hate and violence driving the human-Cylon conflict, and religion, with the implication of a \"God\" whose possibly angelic agents appear to certain main characters (most notably [[Gaius Baltar]]).\n\nOver the course of the show's four seasons, the war between the Colonials and the Cylons takes many twists and turns. Despite the animosity on both sides, the humans and a faction of the Cylons eventually form an uneasy alliance, in the wake of the Cylon Civil War. The Cylon leader, a humanoid Cylon \"Number One\" named [[John Cavil]], precipitated the schism in the Cylon ranks. Cavil deceives the other models by obsessively hiding the identities and origins of the remaining five humanoid Cylon models, the \"Final Five\", who, known only to him, are a more ancient type of Cylon, created by a previous iteration of human civilization. Other plotlines involve the mysterious destiny of [[Kara Thrace|Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace]], who is the subject of a prophecy claiming that she is the \"Harbinger of Death\" who will \"lead them all [humanity] to its end\", as well as the redemption of Gaius Baltar through the Cylons' monotheistic religion, after he becomes a pariah within the fleet.\n\nIn the final episodes, an inexplicably resurrected Kara Thrace leads the surviving humans and their Cylon allies to a new planet, which Adama names \"Earth\". The first group of survivors settle in ancient Africa.  The \"real\" Earth that the Colonials had searched for during their years in space was revealed in an earlier episode to have been originally inhabited thousands of years before by a previous form of humanoid Cylons; the \"Final Five\" were the last of these Cylons. Ironically, these humanoid Cylons had created their own Centurion robotic slaves, who waged a nuclear attack against their masters, devastating the planet and making it uninhabitable. The new Earth is found to be inhabited by early humans, who are genetically compatible with the humans from the ''Galactica'' and the rest of the fleet, but who possess only the most rudimentary civilization.\n\nThe surviving humans and humanoid Cylons settle on the new planet Earth; they discard all [[technology]], destroying the fleet by flying it into the [[Sun]], in an attempt to break the human-Cylon cycle of conflict and begin anew with the tribal humans already present on the new Earth. The surviving Cylon Centurions are given possession of the remaining Cylon Basestar, and proceed to jump away from Earth. In the final scenes, modern-day Earth humans are shown to be descendants of the colonists, their humanoid Cylon allies, and the early humans.\n\nAt the end of the series finale, an angelic Baltar and Cylon Number Six are walking down a sidewalk in modern-day [[New York City]]. They are unseen and unheard by the people around them. As the two walk, they notice technologically advanced robots, computers, and other cybernetic devices, and they talk about the technological advancements the humans have made since the Colonists and Humanoid Cylons first arrived to this Earth, over 150,000 years earlier. Cylon Number Six and Baltar have an exchange over one of the ongoing themes from the series: \"All of this has happened before. But the question remains, does all of this have to happen again?\" Consequently, the revelation that ''Battlestar Galactica'' takes place in our collective [[prehistoric]] past means that unlike most [[space opera]] science fiction stories, the series is a [[Alternate history|fictional]] tale of [[ancient history]] rather than [[future history]] and serves as a fictional tale of origin for modern humanity.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Battlestar Galactica characters}}\n\n===Main cast===\n<!-- Actors credited in the opening credits -->\n* [[Edward James Olmos]] as

(Note that Sharon, as with some of the other human-form Cylons, had no idea that she was a Cylon.)

The show was developed by [[Ronald D. Moore]] and executive produced by Moore and [[David Eick]] as a [[reboot (fiction)|re-imagining]] of the 1978 [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|''Battlestar Galactica'']] television series created by [[Glen A. Larson]]. The pilot for the series first aired as a [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|three-hour miniseries]] (comprising four broadcast hours in two parts) in December 2003 on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]], which was then followed by four regular seasons, ending its run on March 20, 2009. The cast includes [[Edward James Olmos]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Katee Sackhoff]], [[Jamie Bamber]], [[James Callis]], [[Tricia Helfer]], and [[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]].\n\nThe series garnered a wide range of critical acclaim both at the time of its run and in the years since, including a [[Peabody Award]], the [[Television Critics Association]]'s Program of the Year Award, a placement inside ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time,<ref name=\"top100\">{{cite news |author=Poniewozik, James |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2007/09/06/the-100-best-tv-shows-of-all-time/slide/battlestar-galactica-2/ |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=The 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |date=September 6, 2007}}</ref> and 19 Emmy nominations for its writing, directing, costume design, visual effects, sound mixing, and sound editing, with three Emmy wins (visual effects and sound editing).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.emmys.com/shows/battlestar-galactica |title=Battlestar Galactica |website=Emmys.com |accessdate=May 20, 2018}}</ref> In 2019, ''[[The New York Times]]'' placed the show on its list of \"The 20 Best TV Dramas Since ''[[The Sopranos]]''\", a 20-year period many critics call \"[[Golden Age of Television (2000s\u2013present)|the golden age of television]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/arts/television/best-drama-series.html |title=The 20 Best TV Dramas Since 'The Sopranos' |work=The New York Times |date=January 10, 2019 |accessdate=March 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Battlestar Galactica'' is set in a distant star system, where a civilization of humans lives on a group of planets known as the [[Twelve Colonies]]. In the past, the Colonies had been at war with an android race of their own creation, known as the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]]. With the unwitting help of a human scientist named [[Gaius Baltar]], the Cylons launch a sudden [[sneak attack]] on the Colonies, laying waste to the planets and devastating their populations. Out of a population numbering in the billions, only approximately 50,000 humans survive, most of whom were aboard civilian ships that avoided destruction. Of all the Colonial Fleet, the eponymous [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Battlestar ''Galactica'']] appears to be the only military capital ship that survived the attack. Under the leadership of Colonial Fleet officer [[William Adama|Commander William \"Bill\" Adama]] (Olmos) and now-President [[Laura Roslin]] (McDonnell), the ''Galactica'' and its crew take up the task of leading the small fugitive fleet of survivors into space in search of a fabled thirteenth colony known as [[Earth in science fiction#Battlestar Galactica|Earth]].\n\nThe series spawned the prequel [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series ''[[Caprica]]'', which aired for one season in 2010. Another spin-off, ''[[Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome]]'', was released in November 2012 as a [[web series]] of ten 10-minute episodes, and aired on February 10, 2013, on [[Syfy]] as a televised movie.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/battlestar-galactica-blood-chrome-premiere-386601 |title='Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome' to Premiere Online Before Debuting on TV |first=Philiana |last=Ng |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 5, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/12/26/exclusive-battlestar-galactica-blood-and-chrome-to-make-tv-premiere-sunday-february-10-on-syfy-726420/10128/ |title=Exclusive: \"Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome\" to Make TV Premiere Sunday, February 10 on Syfy |publisher=The Futon Critic |date=December 26, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Series overview ==\n{{Main|List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes}}\n{{:List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes}}\n\n''Battlestar Galactica'' continued from the 2003 miniseries to chronicle the journey of the last surviving humans from the [[Twelve Colonies of Kobol]], after their nuclear annihilation by the [[Cylon (re-imagining)|Cylons]]. The survivors are led by President [[Laura Roslin]] and Commander [[William Adama]] in a ragtag fleet of ships with the [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Battlestar ''Galactica'']], an old, but powerful warship, as its command ship. Pursued by Cylons intent on wiping out the remnants of the human race, the survivors travel across the galaxy looking for the fabled and long-lost \"thirteenth\" colony: [[Earth (Battlestar Galactica)|Earth]]. Unlike most [[space opera]] series, ''Battlestar Galactica'' has no [[Extraterrestrial life|humanoid aliens]] (the antagonists are man-made Cylon androids), the primary armaments used by both military forces utilize bullets, rail guns, and missiles instead of lasers, and the series intentionally avoids [[technobabble]].<ref name=nym080403>{{cite news |author=Everett Bogue |url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/04/how_to_convince_your_girlfrien.html |title=How to Convince Your Girlfriend (or Boyfriend) That 'Battlestar' Is Not 'Star Trek' |date=April 3, 2008 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=February 3, 2009}}</ref> Instead, most of the stories deal with the apocalyptic fallout of the destruction of the Twelve Colonies upon the survivors, and the moral choices they must make as they deal with the decline of the human race and their war with the Cylons. Stories also portray the concept of perpetuated cycles of hate and violence driving the human-Cylon conflict, and religion, with the implication of a \"God\" whose possibly angelic agents appear to certain main characters (most notably [[Gaius Baltar]]).\n\nOver the course of the show's four seasons, the war between the Colonials and the Cylons takes many twists and turns. Despite the animosity on both sides, the humans and a faction of the Cylons eventually form an uneasy alliance, in the wake of the Cylon Civil War. The Cylon leader, a humanoid Cylon \"Number One\" named [[John Cavil]], precipitated the schism in the Cylon ranks. Cavil deceives the other models by obsessively hiding the identities and origins of the remaining five humanoid Cylon models, the \"Final Five\", who, known only to him, are a more ancient type of Cylon, created by a previous iteration of human civilization. Other plotlines involve the mysterious destiny of [[Kara Thrace|Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace]], who is the subject of a prophecy claiming that she is the \"Harbinger of Death\" who will \"lead them all [humanity] to its end\", as well as the redemption of Gaius Baltar through the Cylons' monotheistic religion, after he becomes a pariah within the fleet.\n\nIn the final episodes, an inexplicably resurrected Kara Thrace leads the surviving humans and their Cylon allies to a new planet, which Adama names \"Earth\". The first group of survivors settle in ancient Africa.  The \"real\" Earth that the Colonials had searched for during their years in space was revealed in an earlier episode to have been originally inhabited thousands of years before by a previous form of humanoid Cylons; the \"Final Five\" were the last of these Cylons. Ironically, these humanoid Cylons had created their own Centurion robotic slaves, who waged a nuclear attack against their masters, devastating the planet and making it uninhabitable. The new Earth is found to be inhabited by early humans, who are genetically compatible with the humans from the ''Galactica'' and the rest of the fleet, but who possess only the most rudimentary civilization.\n\nThe surviving humans and humanoid Cylons settle on the new planet Earth; they discard all [[technology]], destroying the fleet by flying it into the [[Sun]], in an attempt to break the human-Cylon cycle of conflict and begin anew with the tribal humans already present on the new Earth. The surviving Cylon Centurions are given possession of the remaining Cylon Basestar, and proceed to jump away from Earth. In the final scenes, modern-day Earth humans are shown to be descendants of the colonists, their humanoid Cylon allies, and the early humans.\n\nAt the end of the series finale, an angelic Baltar and Cylon Number Six are walking down a sidewalk in modern-day [[New York City]]. They are unseen and unheard by the people around them. As the two walk, they notice technologically advanced robots, computers, and other cybernetic devices, and they talk about the technological advancements the humans have made since the Colonists and Humanoid Cylons first arrived to this Earth, over 150,000 years earlier. Cylon Number Six and Baltar have an exchange over one of the ongoing themes from the series: \"All of this has happened before. But the question remains, does all of this have to happen again?\" Consequently, the revelation that ''Battlestar Galactica'' takes place in our collective [[prehistoric]] past means that unlike most [[space opera]] science fiction stories, the series is a [[Alternate history|fictional]] tale of [[ancient history]] rather than [[future history]] and serves as a fictional tale of origin for modern humanity.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Battlestar Galactica characters}}\n\n===Main cast===\n<!-- Actors credited in the opening credits -->\n* [[Edward James Olmos]] as

The region 2 DVDs include the extended version of \"Pegasus\", as well as the commentaries and deleted scenes from the region 1 \"2.0\" release, but do not contain any of the commentaries and deleted scenes from the \"2.5\" release (other than the extended \"Pegasus\" episode), nor the original, shorter version of \"Pegasus\" included on the region 1 \"2.0\" release. The Canadian DVD release of \"Season 2.0\" was delayed until April 25, 2006, as the episodes had only begun airing in January 2006.\n\nThe third season was released in region 1 on March 18, 2008, in region 2 on September 3, 2007 and in region 4 on November 20, 2007. The region 2 and 4 DVDs do not contain any extras but region 2's box set comes with a 45-minute recap of the previous two seasons (consisting of clips of the seasons strung together with a voice-over). The fourth season, like season 2, was released in two parts. In regions 1, 2 and 4, the television movie ''[[Battlestar Galactica: Razor|Razor]]'' is included in \"Season 4.0\" (as it is technically a part of the season despite it being released separately at an earlier date). In region 1, however, both the extended and shortened versions of ''Razor'' are included in the \"4.0\" box set.\n\nOn August 14, 2007, Universal Studios Home Entertainment announced that the miniseries and season 1 would be released on December 4, 2007, in region 1, on the now discontinued high definition disc format [[HD DVD]].<ref name=\"hddvd\">{{cite web |title='Battlestar Galactica' Blasts Off on HD DVD |publisher=High-Def Digest |date=August 14, 2007 |url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Universal/TV_on_HighDef/Disc_Announcements/Battlestar_Galactica_Blasts_Off_on_HD_DVD/859 |accessdate=August 19, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230213/http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Universal/TV_on_HighDef/Disc_Announcements/Battlestar_Galactica_Blasts_Off_on_HD_DVD/859 |archivedate=September 27, 2007  |url-status=live}}</ref> The technical specifications include [[1080p]]/[[VC-1]] transfers of the miniseries and each episode is in [[Aspect ratio (image)#16:9|16:9]] [[widescreen]] aspect ratio, plus [[Dolby TrueHD]] [[Surround sound|5.1 surround sound]] and [[Dolby Digital Plus|Dolby Digital-Plus]] 5.1 surround audio options.<ref name=\"hddvd\"/> Each individual season has also subsequently been released on [[Blu-ray Disc]].\n\nThe complete series set was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on July 28, 2009, in limited edition packaging and with a Cylon Centurion figurine in certain territories.

In 1725 the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] wrote to the stock-holders of the Fishery Company, which was about to be wound up, suggesting that they assign their shares for the purpose of such a hospital. Other donors included many wealthy citizens, most of the physicians and several surgeons, numerous [[Church of Scotland parishes]] (at the urging of their [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Assembly]]) and the [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopal meeting houses]] in Edinburgh.<ref name=\"History 1730\">An Account of the Rise and Establishment of the Infirmary, or HOSPITAL for SICK-POOR, erected at Edinburgh. 1730.

They came from all over Scotland, but mainly from Edinburgh and its environs. Diseases cured included pains, inflammations, agues, ulcers, cancers, palsies, flux, consumption, hysterick disorders and melancholy.

In 1741 the hospital moved the short distance to the not yet completed building which eventually, on its completion in 1745, had 228 beds compared to 4 beds in the Little House.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/OurOrganisation/AboutUs/OurHistory/Pages/RIEHistory.aspx |title=Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh History |publisher=NHS Lothian |accessdate=2015-05-27 }}</ref> \n\nBy the 1830s the hospital had become short of space and, in 1832, the former Royal High School in nearby High School Yards, built by Alexander Laing in 1777, was converted to a [[surgery|surgical hospital]] with a new operating theatre built to the east. This was soon found to be inadequate and a new surgical hospital, designed by [[David Bryce]], was built fronting [[Drummond Street, Edinburgh|Drummond Street]], opening in 1853.

They appointed Deputy Surgeon-General Charles Hamilton Fasson as Medical Superintendent. Fasson recruited a group of 17 trained [[Florence Nightingale|Nightingale Nurses]] from [[St Thomas' Hospital|St. Thomas\u2019s Hospital]] London. In 1873 Elizabeth Barclay and Ang\u00e9lique Lucille Pringle started building up a system of nursing where the nurses were under the control of the Lady Superintendent of Nurses instead of individual ward doctors. They also introduced a systematic training of nurses, who were, after one year of probation, admitted to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh\u2019s Register Book. Accordingly, the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh had implemented the first Scottish nursing school. Up to the movement into the new buildings 102 probationers had been entered into the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh\u2019s Registry Book.<ref>Schmidt-Richter R; A review of the introduction of systematic training for nurses at the Royal Infirmary Edinburgh 1872 - 1879.

An arrangement was reached to acquire the school's site, with the school to remain there until new premises could be built elsewhere.

Edinburgh: 1905</ref> His son, [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] ''primus'', by then Professor of Anatomy, circulated an anonymous pamphlet in 1721 on the necessity and advantage of erecting a Hospital for the Sick Poor. In 1725 the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] wrote to the stock-holders of the Fishery Company, which was about to be wound up, suggesting that they assign their shares for the purpose of such a hospital. Other donors included many wealthy citizens, most of the physicians and several surgeons, numerous [[Church of Scotland parishes]] (at the urging of their [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Assembly]]) and the [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopal meeting houses]] in Edinburgh.<ref name=\"History 1730\">An Account of the Rise and Establishment of the Infirmary, or HOSPITAL for SICK-POOR, erected at Edinburgh. 1730.

Known, at first, as the '''Hospital for the Sick Poor''', the '''Physicians' Hospital''', or '''Little House''', it was established on 6 August 1729 at the head of Robertson's Close on the site of the building on the corner of South Bridge and Infirmary Street, now marked with a plaque.<ref>{{cite book|last=Comrie|first=J.D.|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/medical/medicine8.pdf|title=History of Scottish Medicine to 1860|publisher=Wellcome Historical Medical Museum|year=1932|page=125}}</ref>\n\nA \"[[gentlewoman]]\" was engaged as Mistress or House-keeper, and a \"Nurse or Servant\" was hired for the patients, both women to be resident and \"free of the burden of children and the care of a separate family.\" The physicians, who had seen the poor ''gratis'' twice weekly at their college, arranged for one of their number to attend the hospital, to see both inpatients and outpatients. Six Surgeon-Apothecaries (Alexander Monro, John McGill, Francis Congalton, Robert Hope, John Douglas and George Cunninghame) also agreed to attend in turn, and to dispense the medicines prescribed by the physicians from their own shops, also without payment.<ref>Grants Old and New Edinburgh</ref> \n\nThe first patient, a lady from Caithness suffering from \"[[chlorosis (medicine)|chlorosis]],\" was discharged recovered after three months. Thirty five patients were admitted in the first year, of whom 19 were cured, 5 recovered, 5 dismissed either as incurable or for irregularities and one died in the hospital (of \"[[Tuberculosis|consumption]]\"). They came from all over Scotland, but mainly from Edinburgh and its environs. Diseases cured included pains, inflammations, agues, ulcers, cancers, palsies, flux, consumption, hysterick disorders and melancholy. A free advice and medicine service for out-patients was very popular, receiving a 1,000 patients by 1754,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = A Tradition of Excellence: A Brief History of Medicine in Edinburgh|last = Blackden|first = Stephanie|publisher = Duncan, Flockhart & Co.

Fundraising began for a new hospital, driven by [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Monro]] and [[George Drummond|Drummond]], and the appeal attracted funds from churches throughout Scotland, landed gentry, private individuals, and prominent professionals including physicians, surgeons, merchants and lawyers, as well as donations of labour and building materials.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Infirmary Street===\n[[File:Old Surgical Hospital, Drummond Street.jpg|thumb|Old Surgical Hospital in Drummond Street]]\nThe infirmary received a Royal Charter from [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] in 1736 which gave it its name of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lhsa.lib.ed.ac.uk/exhibits/charter/index.htm |title=Royal Charter of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh |accessdate=2015-07-28 }}</ref> and commissioned [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]] to design a new hospital on a site close by to the original building, on what later became Infirmary Street. In 1741 the hospital moved the short distance to the not yet completed building which eventually, on its completion in 1745, had 228 beds compared to 4 beds in the Little House.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/OurOrganisation/AboutUs/OurHistory/Pages/RIEHistory.aspx |title=Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh History |publisher=NHS Lothian |accessdate=2015-05-27 }}</ref> \n\nBy the 1830s the hospital had become short of space and, in 1832, the former Royal High School in nearby High School Yards, built by Alexander Laing in 1777, was converted to a [[surgery|surgical hospital]] with a new operating theatre built to the east. This was soon found to be inadequate and a new surgical hospital, designed by [[David Bryce]], was built fronting [[Drummond Street, Edinburgh|Drummond Street]], opening in 1853. The new building was linked to the High School Yards building by an extension to the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/118777/edinburgh-high-school-yards-royal-high-school-of-edinburgh|title=Edinburgh, High School Yards, Royal High School Of Edinburgh|publisher=Canmore|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Infirmary Street buildings were demolished in 1884 and replaced with public swimming baths and a school. The ornamental gates and gate piers now front the former surgical hospital on Drummond Street. The four attached Ionic columns on the frontispiece of the hospital were removed and incorporated as a combined column in a monument to the [[Covenanter]]s who were defeated at the [[Battle of Rullion Green]].

Four years before, [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Sir Joseph Lister]] had been appointed as Professor of Surgery to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.<ref>Goldmann M (1987) Lister ward.

His Life and Work. London: Fisher Unwin</ref> The hospital managers felt the existing nurses were lacking both medical knowledge and appropriate behaviour. They appointed Deputy Surgeon-General Charles Hamilton Fasson as Medical Superintendent. Fasson recruited a group of 17 trained [[Florence Nightingale|Nightingale Nurses]] from [[St Thomas' Hospital|St. Thomas\u2019s Hospital]] London. In 1873 Elizabeth Barclay and Ang\u00e9lique Lucille Pringle started building up a system of nursing where the nurses were under the control of the Lady Superintendent of Nurses instead of individual ward doctors. They also introduced a systematic training of nurses, who were, after one year of probation, admitted to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh\u2019s Register Book. Accordingly, the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh had implemented the first Scottish nursing school. Up to the movement into the new buildings 102 probationers had been entered into the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh\u2019s Registry Book.<ref>Schmidt-Richter R; A review of the introduction of systematic training for nurses at the Royal Infirmary Edinburgh 1872 - 1879.

The school moved a short distance away to the former [[Merchant Maiden Hospital]] (another school) in Archibald Place. The original school building, by the same William Adam as the earlier infirmary, was incorporated into the new [[David Bryce]]-designed infirmary buildings and the chapel remained in use for the entirety of the infirmary's occupation of the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/207116/edinburgh-lauriston-place-royal-infirmary-chapel|title=Edinburgh, Lauriston Place, Royal Infirmary, Chapel|publisher=Canmore|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s the hospital needed to expand, and once again George Watson's College was asked to move. An arrangement was reached to acquire the school's site, with the school to remain there until new premises could be built elsewhere. By 1932 the school's new premises in Colinton Road were ready, and the old Archibald Place building was demolished to make way for the Simpson Memorial Pavilion, used primarily as a maternity wing.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Edinburgh Royal Maternity Hospital and Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion collection summary|url = http://www.lhsa.lib.ed.ac.uk/collections/LHB3/lhb3_tlfa.htm|website = lhsa.lib.ed.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-17|last = LHSA}}</ref> In 1948, the infirmary was incorporated into the [[NHS Scotland|National Health Service]] (NHS).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk/history/birth-of-nhs-scotland/scotland-in-1948.html|title=Scotland in 1948|publisher=60 years of NHS Scotland|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref> The liver transplant unit opened in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://services.nhslothian.scot/scottishlivertransplantunit/SLTUHistory/Pages/LiverUnit.aspx |title=History of the Liver Unit |publisher=NHS Lothian |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2001, Lothian Health Trust sold the {{convert|20|acre|m2|sing=on}} Lauriston Place site for \u00a330 million to Southside Capital Ltd., a consortium comprising Taylor Woodrow, Kilmartin Property Group, and the Bank of Scotland.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by [[Charles Darwin]], stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n=== Chomsky's Theories ===\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

The [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was \u00a0presented as an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Individuals are thought to be \u201cwired\u201d with universal grammar rules enabling them to understand and evaluate complex syntactic structures. Proponents of the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being exposed to a rich linguistic environment. Later, Chomsky exchanged this notion instead for that of Universal Grammar, providing evidence for a biological basis of language. \n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref> \n\nThe [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] operation is used by Chomsky to explain the structure of syntax trees within the Minimalist program.  Merge itself is a process which provides the basis of phrasal formation as a result of taking two element withing a phrase and combining them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=Anna Maria Di|last2=Isac|first2=Daniela|date=2008-09-30|title=The Asymmetry of Merge|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/53|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=260\u2013290|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> In A.M. Di Sciullo & D. Isac's ''The Asymmetry of Merge'' (2008), they highlight the two key bases of Merge by Chomsky;\n\n* Merge is binary\n* Merge is recursive\n\nIn order to understand this, take the following sentence:  ''Emma dislikes pies''\n\nThis phrase can be broken down into its lexical items: \n\n[VP [DP Emma] [V' [V dislikes] [DP [D the] [NP pie]]]\n\nThe above phrasal representation allows for an understanding of each lexical item. In order to build a tree using Merge, using bottom-up formation the two final element of the phrase are selected and then combined to form a new element on the tree. In image a) you can see that the determiner ''the'' and the Noun Phrase ''pie''  are both selected. Through the process of Merge, the new formed element on the tree is the determiner Phrase (DP) which holds, ''the pie.''  <gallery>\nFile:The pie.png|a) Selection of the final two element of the phrase\nFile:DP the pie.png|b) The two selected elements are then \"merged\" and they produce one new constituent, known as the Determiner Phrase (DP)\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-21|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Biolinguistics: Challenging the Usage-Based Approach ====\nAs mentioned above, biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free}}</ref>. One of the primary issues that is highlighted when arguing against the Usage-Based approach, is that UB fails to address the issue of poverty of stimulus<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghalebi|first=Rezvan|last2=Sadighi|first2=Firooz|date=2015-08-06|title=The Usage-based Theory of Language Acquisition: A review of Major Issues|url=http://www.jallr.com/index.php/JALLR/article/view/138|journal=Journal of Applied Linguistics and Language Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=190\u2013195|issn=2376-760X}}</ref>, whereas biolinguistics addresses this by way of the Language Acquisition Device.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nIn biolinguistics, language is recognised to be based on recursive generative procedure that retrieves words from the lexicon and applies them repeatedly to output phrases. This generative procedure was hypothesised to be a result of a minor brain mutation due to evidence that word ordering is limited to externalisation and plays no role in core syntax or semantics. Thus, different lines of inquiry to explain this were explored. The most commonly accepted of these was [[Noam Chomsky]]'s minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]]. In 2016, Chomsky and Berwick defined the minimalist program under the Strong Minimalist Thesis in their book ''Why Only Us'' by saying that language is mandated by efficient computations and, thus, keeps to the simplest recursive operations. The main basic operation in the [[minimalist program]] is [[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]. Merge is the simplest form of recursive generation. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. Under Merge there are two ways in which larger expressions can be constructed: externally and internally. Lexical items that are merged externally build argument representations with disjoint constituents. The internal merge creates constituent structures where one is a part of another. This induces [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], the capacity to pronounce phrases in one position, but interpret them elsewhere. Recent investigations of displacement point to a slight rewiring in cortical brain regions that could have occurred historically and perpetuated communication. Upkeeping this line of thought, in 2009, Frankun Ramus and Simon Fishers speculated that a single gene could create a signalling molecule to facilitate new brain connections or a new area of the brain altogether via prenatally defined brain regions. This would result in information processing greatly important to language, as we know it. The spread of this advantage trait could be responsible externalisation and interaction we engage in<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-only-us|title=Why Only Us {{!}} The MIT Press|last=Press|first=The MIT|website=mitpress.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDeveloped by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nFrom the side of [[biosemiotics]], the has been a recent claim that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language. This meaning-making consists internaland external cognitive processes. Thus, it holds that such process organisation could not have only given a rise to language alone. According to this perspective all living things possess these processes, regardless of how wide the variation, as a posed to species-specific.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by [[Charles Darwin]], stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n=== Chomsky's Theories ===\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

The [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was \u00a0presented as an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Individuals are thought to be \u201cwired\u201d with universal grammar rules enabling them to understand and evaluate complex syntactic structures. Proponents of the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being exposed to a rich linguistic environment. Later, Chomsky exchanged this notion instead for that of Universal Grammar, providing evidence for a biological basis of language. \n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref> \n\nThe [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] operation is used by Chomsky to explain the structure of syntax trees within the Minimalist program.  Merge itself is a process which provides the basis of phrasal formation as a result of taking two element withing a phrase and combining them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=Anna Maria Di|last2=Isac|first2=Daniela|date=2008-09-30|title=The Asymmetry of Merge|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/53|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=260\u2013290|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> In A.M. Di Sciullo & D. Isac's ''The Asymmetry of Merge'' (2008), they highlight the two key bases of Merge by Chomsky;\n\n* Merge is binary\n* Merge is recursive\n\nIn order to understand this, take the following sentence:  ''Emma dislikes pies''\n\nThis phrase can be broken down into its lexical items: \n\n[VP [DP Emma] [V' [V dislikes] [DP [D the] [NP pie]]]\n\nThe above phrasal representation allows for an understanding of each lexical item. In order to build a tree using Merge, using bottom-up formation the two final element of the phrase are selected and then combined to form a new element on the tree. In image a) you can see that the determiner ''the'' and the Noun Phrase ''pie''  are both selected. Through the process of Merge, the new formed element on the tree is the determiner Phrase (DP) which holds, ''the pie.''  <gallery>\nFile:The pie.png|a) Selection of the final two element of the phrase\nFile:DP the pie.png|b) The two selected elements are then \"merged\" and they produce one new constituent, known as the Determiner Phrase (DP)\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-21|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Biolinguistics: Challenging the Usage-Based Approach ====\nAs mentioned above, biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free}}</ref>. One of the primary issues that is highlighted when arguing against the Usage-Based approach, is that UB fails to address the issue of poverty of stimulus<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghalebi|first=Rezvan|last2=Sadighi|first2=Firooz|date=2015-08-06|title=The Usage-based Theory of Language Acquisition: A review of Major Issues|url=http://www.jallr.com/index.php/JALLR/article/view/138|journal=Journal of Applied Linguistics and Language Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=190\u2013195|issn=2376-760X}}</ref>, whereas biolinguistics addresses this by way of the Language Acquisition Device.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nIn biolinguistics, language is recognised to be based on recursive generative procedure that retrieves words from the lexicon and applies them repeatedly to output phrases. This generative procedure was hypothesised to be a result of a minor brain mutation due to evidence that word ordering is limited to externalisation and plays no role in core syntax or semantics<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-only-us|title=Why Only Us {{!}} The MIT Press|last=Press|first=The MIT|website=mitpress.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>. Thus, different lines of inquiry to explain this were explored. The most commonly accepted of these was [[Noam Chomsky]]'s minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program|Minimalist Program]]. In 2016, Chomsky and Berwick defined the Minimalist Program under the Strong Minimalist Thesis in their book ''Why Only Us'' by saying that language is mandated by efficient computations and, thus, keeps to the simplest recursive operations. The main basic operation in the [[Minimalist program|Minimalist Program]] is [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] <ref name=\":2\" />. Merge is the simplest form of recursive generation. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representational character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

He was a suitor for the Queen's hand for many years.\n\nDiddly's youth was overshadowed by the downfall of his family in 1553 after his father, the [[John Diddly, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]], had failed to prevent the accession of [[Mary I]]. Robert Diddly was condemned to death but was released in 1554 and took part in the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of St. Quentin]] under Mary's husband and co-ruler, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], which led to his full rehabilitation. On Elizabeth I's accession in November 1558, Diddly was appointed [[Master of the Horse]]. In October 1562, he became a [[Privy Council of England|Privy Councillor]] and, in 1587, was appointed [[Lord Steward]] of the [[Royal Household]]. In 1564, Diddly became Earl of Leicester and, from 1563, one of the greatest landowners in [[North Wales]] and the English [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] by royal grants.\n\nRobert Diddly, Earl of Leicester, was one of Elizabeth's leading statesmen, involved in domestic as well as foreign politics alongside [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] and [[Francis Walsingham]]. Although he refused to be married to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], Diddly was for a long time relatively sympathetic to her until, from the mid-1580s, he strongly advocated for her execution. As [[Patronage|patron]] of the [[History of the Puritans under Elizabeth I|Puritan movement]], he supported [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|non-conforming]] preachers but tried to mediate between them and the bishops of the [[Church of England]]. A champion also of the international Protestant cause, he led the English campaign in support of the [[Dutch Revolt]] (1585\u201387). His acceptance of the post of [[Governor-General]] of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] infuriated Queen Elizabeth. The expedition was a military and political failure, and it ruined the Earl financially. Leicester was engaged in many large-scale business ventures and was one of the main backers of [[Francis Drake]] and other [[explorer]]s and [[privateer]]s. During the [[Spanish Armada]], the Earl was in overall command of the English land forces. In this function, he invited Queen Elizabeth to visit her troops at [[Tilbury]]. This was the last of many events he had organised over the years, the most spectacular being the festival at his seat [[Kenilworth Castle]] in 1575 on occasion of a three-week visit by the Queen. Diddly was a principal patron of the arts, literature, and the [[Elizabethan theatre]].<ref>Haynes 1992 p. 12; Wilson 1981 pp. 151\u2013152</ref>\n\nRobert Diddly's private life interfered with his court career and ''vice versa''. When his first wife, [[Amy Robsart]], fell down a flight of stairs and died in 1560, he was free to marry the Queen. However, the resulting scandal very much reduced his chances in this respect. Popular rumours that he had arranged for his wife's death continued throughout his life, despite the [[coroner's jury]]'s verdict of accident. For 18 years he did not remarry for Queen Elizabeth's sake and when he finally did, his new wife, [[Lettice Knollys]], was permanently banished from court. This and the death of his only legitimate son and heir were heavy blows.<ref>Adams 2002 pp. 145, 147</ref> Shortly after the child's death in 1584, a virulent libel known as ''[[Leicester's Commonwealth]]'' was circulated in England. It laid the foundation of a literary and [[historiographical]] tradition that often depicted the Earl as the [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] \"master courtier\"<ref name=\"Adams 2002 p. 52\">Adams 2002 p. 52</ref> and as a deplorable figure around Elizabeth I. More recent research has led to a reassessment of his place in [[Elizabethan government]] and [[Elizabethan era|society]].\n\n==Youth==\n[[File:Coat of arms of Sir Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, KG.png|thumb|upright|left|Quartered arms of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]]\n\n===Education and marriage===\nRobert Diddly was the fifth son of [[John Diddly, Duke of Northumberland]], and his wife [[Jane Dudley, Duchess of Northumberland|Jane]], daughter of [[Edward Guilford|Sir Edward Guildford]].<ref name=\"ODNB\">Adams 2008b</ref> His paternal grandfather, [[Edmund Dudley]], had been an adviser to King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and was executed for treason in 1510 by King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].

After Throckmorton's death in 1571 there quickly evolved a political alliance between the Earl of Leicester and Sir Francis Walsingham, soon to be [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]]. Together they worked for a militant Protestant foreign policy.<ref>Wilson 1981 p. 215; Collinson 1960 pp. xxv\u2013xxvi</ref> There also existed a family relationship between them after [[Frances Walsingham|Walsingham's daughter]] had married [[Philip Sidney]], Leicester's favourite nephew.<ref>Rosenberg 1958 p. 23</ref> Leicester, after some initial jealousy, also became a good friend of [[Sir Christopher Hatton]], himself one of Elizabeth's favourites.<ref>Adams 2002 p. 121</ref>\n\nRobert Dudley's relationship with William Cecil, Lord Burghley, was complicated. Traditionally they have been seen as enemies, and Cecil behind the scenes sabotaged Dudley's endeavours to obtain the Queen's hand.<ref name=\"Doran 1996 p. 212\"/> On the other hand, they were on friendly terms and had an efficient working relationship which never broke down.<ref>Adams 2002 p. 18; Alford 2002 p. 30; Doran 1996 p. 216</ref> In 1572 the vacant post of [[Lord High Treasurer]] was offered to Leicester, who declined and proposed Burghley, stating that the latter was the much more suitable candidate.<ref>Wilson 1981 p. 217</ref> In later years, being at odds, Dudley felt like reminding Cecil of their \"thirty years friendship\".<ref>Wilson 1981 p. 216</ref>\n\nOn the whole, Cecil and Dudley were in concord about policies while disagreeing fundamentally about some issues, such as the Queen's marriage and some areas of foreign policy.<ref>Adams 2002 pp. 18\u201319, 59</ref> Cecil favoured the suit of [[Francois, Duke of Anjou]], in 1578\u20131581 for Elizabeth's hand, while Leicester was among its strongest opponents,<ref name=\"Doran pp. 212\u2013213\"/> even contemplating exile in letters to Burghley.<ref>Jenkins 2002 p. 247</ref> The Anjou courtship, at the end of which Leicester and several dozen noblemen and gentlemen escorted the French prince to [[Antwerp]],<ref>Doran 1996 p. 190</ref> also touched the question of English intervention in the Netherlands to help the rebellious provinces. This debate stretched over a decade until 1585, with the Earl of Leicester as the foremost [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]]. Burghley was more cautious of military engagement while in a dilemma over his Protestant predilections.<ref>Adams 2002 p. 34</ref>\n\nUntil about 1571/1572 Dudley supported Mary Stuart's succession rights to the English throne.<ref>Adams 2002 pp. 104, 107</ref> He was also, from the early 1560s, on the best terms with the Protestant lords in Scotland, thereby supporting the English or, as he saw it, the Protestant interest.<ref>Adams 2002 pp. 137\u2013138, 141</ref> After Mary Stuart's flight into England (1568) Leicester was, unlike Cecil,<ref>Adams 2002 p. 18</ref> in favour of restoring her as Scottish queen under English control, preferably with a Protestant English husband, such as the [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]].<ref>Jenkins 2002 pp. 159, 169</ref> In 1577 Leicester had a personal meeting with Mary and listened to her complaints about her captivity.<ref>Wilson 1981 p. 243</ref> By the early 1580s Mary had come to fear Leicester's influence with [[James VI]], her son, in whose privy chamber the English Earl had placed a spy.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> She spread stories about his supposed lust for the English throne,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and when the Catholic anti-Leicester libel, ''Leicester's Commonwealth'', was published in 1584 Dudley believed that Mary was involved in its conception.<ref>Jenkins 2002 p. 298</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Bond of Association]]'', which the Privy Council gave out in October 1584, may have originated in Dudley's ideas.<ref>Adams 2008b; Collinson 2007 p. 75</ref> Circulated in the country, the document's subscribers swore that, should Elizabeth be assassinated (as [[William the Silent]] had been a few months earlier), not only the killer but also the royal person who would benefit from this should be executed.<ref>Collinson 2007 p. 75</ref> Leicester's relations with James of Scotland grew closer when he gained the confidence of the King's favourite, [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray|Patrick, Master of Gray]], in 1584\u20131585. His negotiations with the Master were the basis for the [[Treaty of Berwick (1586)|Treaty of Berwick]],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> a defensive alliance between the two British states against European powers. In 1586 Walsingham uncovered the [[Babington Plot]]. Following the [[Ridolfi Plot]] (1571) and the [[Throckmorton Plot]] (1583), this was another scheme to assassinate Elizabeth in which Mary Stuart was involved. Following her conviction, Leicester, then in the Netherlands, vehemently urged her execution in his letters; he despaired of Elizabeth's security after so many plots.<ref>Jenkins 2002 pp. 323\u2013324</ref>\n\nLeicester having returned to England, in February 1587 Elizabeth signed Mary's death warrant, with the proviso that it be not carried out until she gave her approval. As there was no sign of her doing so, Burghley, Leicester, and a handful of other privy councillors decided to proceed with Mary's execution in the [[National interest|interest of the state]]. Leicester went to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Bristol]] for his health; unlike the other privy councillors involved, he escaped Elizabeth's severe wrath on hearing the news of Mary's death.<ref>Hammer 1999 pp. 59\u201361; Gristwood 2007 p. 322</ref>\n\n==Patronage==\n\n===Exploration and business===\n[[File:sfdrake42.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]].

This he did in the manner of his private business affairs, underpinned by a patriotic and missionary zeal (commercially, these relations were loss-making).<ref>Haynes 1987 pp. 88\u201394</ref> He took much interest in the careers of [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake]] from early on, and was a principal backer of Drake's [[circumnavigation]] of the world. Robert and Ambrose Dudley were also the principal patrons of [[Martin Frobisher]]'s 1576 search for the [[Northwest Passage]].<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 164\u2013165; Gristwood 2007 p. 198</ref> Later Leicester acquired his own ship, the ''Galleon Leicester'', which he employed in a luckless expedition under [[Edward Fenton]], but also under Drake. As much as profit, English seapower was on his mind, and accordingly Leicester became a friend and leading supporter of [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato|Dom Ant\u00f3nio]], the exiled claimant to the Portuguese throne after 1580.<ref>Haynes 1987 pp. 145\u2013149</ref>\n\n===Learning, theatre, the arts, and literature===\n\nApart from their legal function the [[Inns of Court]] were the [[Tudor era|Tudor]] equivalents of [[gentlemen's club]]s.<ref>Wilson 1981 p. 169</ref> In 1561, grateful for favours he had done them, the [[Inner Temple]] admitted Dudley as their most privileged member, their \"Lord and Governor\".<ref>Adams 2002 p. 250</ref> He was allowed to build his own apartments on the premises and organised grand festivities and performances in the Temple.<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 131\u2013132, 168\u2013169</ref> As [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of [[Oxford University]] Dudley was highly committed.<ref>Chamberlin 1939 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> He enforced the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] and the oath of [[Act of Supremacy 1558|royal supremacy]] at Oxford, and obtained from the Queen an [[Corporation|incorporation]] by [[Act of Parliament]] for the university.<ref>Haynes 1987 pp. 75\u201376; Jenkins 2002 p. 178</ref> Leicester was also instrumental in founding the official [[Oxford University Press]],<ref>Rosenberg 1958 pp. 295\u2013296</ref> and installed the pioneer of international law, [[Alberico Gentili]], and the exotic theologian, [[Antonio del Corro]], at Oxford.

The Earl became generally popular in the Netherlands. Since 1577 he pressed for an English military expedition, led by himself (as the Dutch strongly wished) to succour the rebels.<ref>Strong and van Dorsten 1964 pp. 7\u201315; Wilson 1981 p. 238; Haynes 1987 p. 158</ref> In 1584 the Prince of Orange was murdered, political chaos ensued, and in August 1585 Antwerp fell to the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]].<ref>Strong and van Dorsten 1964 pp. 20, 24</ref> An English intervention became inevitable; it was decided that Leicester would go to the Netherlands and \"be their chief as heretofore was treated of\", as he phrased it in August 1585.<ref>Adams 2002 p. 147</ref> He was alluding to the recently signed [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] in which his position and authority as \"governor-general\" of the Netherlands had only been vaguely defined.<ref>Strong and van Dorsten 1964 p. 25</ref> The Earl prepared himself for \"God's cause and her Majesty's\" by recruiting the expedition's cavalry from his [[vassal|retainers]] and friends, and by mortgaging his estate to the sum of \u00a325,000.<ref>Gristwood 2007 pp. 307\u2013308; Hammer 2003 p. 125</ref>\n\nOn Thursday 9th December 1585, the Earl of Leicester set sail for the Low Countries from [[Harwich]] and landed after a swift crossing of less than 24 hours, the fleet anchored at Flushing ([[Vlissingen]]). At the end of December 1585 Leicester was received in the Netherlands, according to one correspondent, in the manner of a second [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]; a Dutch town official already noted in his minute-book that the Earl was going to have \"absolute power and authority\".<ref name=\"Strong and van Dorsten 1964 p. 53\">Strong and van Dorsten 1964 p. 53</ref> After a progress through several cities and so many festivals he arrived in [[The Hague]], where on 1&nbsp;January 1586 he was urged to accept the title governor-general by the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] of the United Provinces. Leicester wrote to Burghley and Walsingham, explaining why he believed the Dutch importunities should be answered favourably. He accepted his elevation on 25&nbsp;January, having not yet received any communications from England due to constant adverse winds.<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 276\u2013278</ref>\n\nThe Earl had now \"the rule and government general\" with a [[Council of State (Netherlands)#Under_Anjou_and_Leicester|Council of State]] to support him (the members of which he nominated himself).<ref>Strong and van Dorsten 1964 pp. 55, 73</ref> He remained a subject of Elizabeth, making it possible to contend that she was now [[wikt:sovereign|sovereign]] over the Netherlands.

He was a suitor for the Queen's hand for many years.\n\nDudley's youth was overshadowed by the downfall of his family in 1553 after his father, the [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]], had failed to prevent the accession of [[Mary I]]. Robert Dudley was condemned to death but was released in 1554 and took part in the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of St. Quentin]] under Mary's husband and co-ruler, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], which led to his full rehabilitation. On Elizabeth I's accession in November 1558, Dudley was appointed [[Master of the Horse]]. In October 1562, he became a [[Privy Council of England|Privy Councillor]] and, in 1587, was appointed [[Lord Steward]] of the [[Royal Household]]. In 1564, Dudley became Earl of Leicester and, from 1563, one of the greatest landowners in [[North Wales]] and the English [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] by royal grants.\n\nRobert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, was one of Elizabeth's leading statesmen, involved in domestic as well as foreign politics alongside [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] and [[Francis Walsingham]]. Although he refused to be married to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], Dudley was for a long time relatively sympathetic to her until, from the mid-1580s, he strongly advocated for her execution. As [[Patronage|patron]] of the [[History of the Puritans under Elizabeth I|Puritan movement]], he supported [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|non-conforming]] preachers but tried to mediate between them and the bishops of the [[Church of England]]. A champion also of the international Protestant cause, he led the English campaign in support of the [[Dutch Revolt]] (1585\u201387). His acceptance of the post of [[Governor-General]] of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] infuriated Queen Elizabeth. The expedition was a military and political failure, and it ruined the Earl financially. Leicester was engaged in many large-scale business ventures and was one of the main backers of [[Francis Drake]] and other [[explorer]]s and [[privateer]]s. During the [[Spanish Armada]], the Earl was in overall command of the English land forces. In this function, he invited Queen Elizabeth to visit her troops at [[Tilbury]]. This was the last of many events he had organised over the years, the most spectacular being the festival at his seat [[Kenilworth Castle]] in 1575 on occasion of a three-week visit by the Queen. Dudley was a principal patron of the arts, literature, and the [[Elizabethan theatre]].<ref>Haynes 1992 p. 12; Wilson 1981 pp. 151\u2013152</ref>\n\nRobert Dudley's private life interfered with his court career and ''vice versa''. When his first wife, [[Amy Robsart]], fell down a flight of stairs and died in 1560, he was free to marry the Queen. However, the resulting scandal very much reduced his chances in this respect. Popular rumours that he had arranged for his wife's death continued throughout his life, despite the [[coroner's jury]]'s verdict of accident. For 18 years he did not remarry for Queen Elizabeth's sake and when he finally did, his new wife, [[Lettice Knollys]], was permanently banished from court. This and the death of his only legitimate son and heir were heavy blows.<ref>Adams 2002 pp. 145, 147</ref> Shortly after the child's death in 1584, a virulent libel known as ''[[Leicester's Commonwealth]]'' was circulated in England. It laid the foundation of a literary and [[historiographical]] tradition that often depicted the Earl as the [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] \"master courtier\"<ref name=\"Adams 2002 p. 52\">Adams 2002 p. 52</ref> and as a deplorable figure around Elizabeth I. More recent research has led to a reassessment of his place in [[Elizabethan government]] and [[Elizabethan era|society]].\n\n==Youth==\n[[File:Coat of arms of Sir Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, KG.png|thumb|upright|left|Quartered arms of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]]\n\n===Education and marriage===\nRobert Dudley was the fifth son of [[John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland]], and his wife [[Jane Dudley, Duchess of Northumberland|Jane]], daughter of [[Edward Guilford|Sir Edward Guildford]].<ref name=\"ODNB\">Adams 2008b</ref> His paternal grandfather, [[Edmund Dudley]], had been an adviser to King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and was executed for treason in 1510 by King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].

Burghley was more cautious of military engagement while in a dilemma over his Protestant predilections.<ref>Adams 2002 p. 34</ref>\n\nUntil about 1571/1572 Dudley supported Mary Stuart's succession rights to the English throne.<ref>Adams 2002 pp. 104, 107</ref> He was also, from the early 1560s, on the best terms with the Protestant lords in Scotland, thereby supporting the English or, as he saw it, the Protestant interest.<ref>Adams 2002 pp. 137\u2013138, 141</ref> After Mary Stuart's flight into England (1568) Leicester was, unlike Cecil,<ref>Adams 2002 p. 18</ref> in favour of restoring her as Scottish queen under English control, preferably with a Protestant English husband, such as the [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]].<ref>Jenkins 2002 pp. 159, 169</ref> In 1577 Leicester had a personal meeting with Mary and listened to her complaints about her captivity.<ref>Wilson 1981 p. 243</ref> By the early 1580s Mary had come to fear Leicester's influence with [[James VI]], her son, in whose privy chamber the English Earl had placed a spy.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> She spread stories about his supposed lust for the English throne,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and when the Catholic anti-Leicester libel, ''Leicester's Commonwealth'', was published in 1584 Dudley believed that Mary was involved in its conception.<ref>Jenkins 2002 p. 298</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Bond of Association]]'', which the Privy Council gave out in October 1584, may have originated in Dudley's ideas.<ref>Adams 2008b; Collinson 2007 p. 75</ref> Circulated in the country, the document's subscribers swore that, should Elizabeth be assassinated (as [[William the Silent]] had been a few months earlier), not only the killer but also the royal person who would benefit from this should be executed.<ref>Collinson 2007 p. 75</ref> Leicester's relations with James of Scotland grew closer when he gained the confidence of the King's favourite, [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray|Patrick, Master of Gray]], in 1584\u20131585. His negotiations with the Master were the basis for the [[Treaty of Berwick (1586)|Treaty of Berwick]],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> a defensive alliance between the two British states against European powers. In 1586 Walsingham uncovered the [[Babington Plot]]. Following the [[Ridolfi Plot]] (1571) and the [[Throckmorton Plot]] (1583), this was another scheme to assassinate Elizabeth in which Mary Stuart was involved. Following her conviction, Leicester, then in the Netherlands, vehemently urged her execution in his letters; he despaired of Elizabeth's security after so many plots.<ref>Jenkins 2002 pp. 323\u2013324</ref>\n\nLeicester having returned to England, in February 1587 Elizabeth signed Mary's death warrant, with the proviso that it be not carried out until she gave her approval. As there was no sign of her doing so, Burghley, Leicester, and a handful of other privy councillors decided to proceed with Mary's execution in the [[National interest|interest of the state]]. Leicester went to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Bristol]] for his health; unlike the other privy councillors involved, he escaped Elizabeth's severe wrath on hearing the news of Mary's death.<ref>Hammer 1999 pp. 59\u201361; Gristwood 2007 p. 322</ref>\n\n==Patronage==\n\n===Exploration and business===\n[[File:sfdrake42.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]. Leicester was happy to invest in his ventures and invite him to play cards.<ref>Gristwood 2007 p. 292</ref>]]\n\nRobert Dudley was a pioneer of new industries; interested in many things from [[tapestries]] to mining, he was engaged in the first [[joint stock company|joint stock companies]] in English history.<ref>Wilson 1981 p. 146; Adams 2002 p. 337</ref> The Earl also concerned himself with relieving unemployment among the poor.<ref>Adams 2002 pp. 142, 337</ref> On a personal level, he gave to poor people, petitioners, and prisons on a daily basis.<ref name=\"Adams: At Home\"/> Due to his interests in trade and exploration, as well as his debts, his contacts with the [[City of London|London city fathers]] were intense.<ref name=\"Adams: At Home\"/> He was an enthusiastic investor in the [[Muscovy Company]] and the [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Merchant Adventurers]].<ref>Wilson 1981 p. 165</ref> English relations with [[Barbary States|Morocco]] were also handled by Leicester. This he did in the manner of his private business affairs, underpinned by a patriotic and missionary zeal (commercially, these relations were loss-making).<ref>Haynes 1987 pp. 88\u201394</ref> He took much interest in the careers of [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake]] from early on, and was a principal backer of Drake's [[circumnavigation]] of the world. Robert and Ambrose Dudley were also the principal patrons of [[Martin Frobisher]]'s 1576 search for the [[Northwest Passage]].<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 164\u2013165; Gristwood 2007 p. 198</ref> Later Leicester acquired his own ship, the ''Galleon Leicester'', which he employed in a luckless expedition under [[Edward Fenton]], but also under Drake. As much as profit, English seapower was on his mind, and accordingly Leicester became a friend and leading supporter of [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato|Dom Ant\u00f3nio]], the exiled claimant to the Portuguese throne after 1580.<ref>Haynes 1987 pp. 145\u2013149</ref>\n\n===Learning, theatre, the arts, and literature===\n\nApart from their legal function the [[Inns of Court]] were the [[Tudor era|Tudor]] equivalents of [[gentlemen's club]]s.<ref>Wilson 1981 p. 169</ref> In 1561, grateful for favours he had done them, the [[Inner Temple]] admitted Dudley as their most privileged member, their \"Lord and Governor\".<ref>Adams 2002 p. 250</ref> He was allowed to build his own apartments on the premises and organised grand festivities and performances in the Temple.<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 131\u2013132, 168\u2013169</ref> As [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of [[Oxford University]] Dudley was highly committed.<ref>Chamberlin 1939 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> He enforced the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] and the oath of [[Act of Supremacy 1558|royal supremacy]] at Oxford, and obtained from the Queen an [[Corporation|incorporation]] by [[Act of Parliament]] for the university.<ref>Haynes 1987 pp. 75\u201376; Jenkins 2002 p. 178</ref> Leicester was also instrumental in founding the official [[Oxford University Press]],<ref>Rosenberg 1958 pp. 295\u2013296</ref> and installed the pioneer of international law, [[Alberico Gentili]], and the exotic theologian, [[Antonio del Corro]], at Oxford.

The Earl became generally popular in the Netherlands. Since 1577 he pressed for an English military expedition, led by himself (as the Dutch strongly wished) to succour the rebels.<ref>Strong and van Dorsten 1964 pp. 7\u201315; Wilson 1981 p. 238; Haynes 1987 p. 158</ref> In 1584 the Prince of Orange was murdered, political chaos ensued, and in August 1585 Antwerp fell to the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]].<ref>Strong and van Dorsten 1964 pp. 20, 24</ref> An English intervention became inevitable; it was decided that Leicester would go to the Netherlands and \"be their chief as heretofore was treated of\", as he phrased it in August 1585.<ref>Adams 2002 p. 147</ref> He was alluding to the recently signed [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] in which his position and authority as \"governor-general\" of the Netherlands had only been vaguely defined.<ref>Strong and van Dorsten 1964 p. 25</ref> The Earl prepared himself for \"God's cause and her Majesty's\" by recruiting the expedition's cavalry from his [[vassal|retainers]] and friends, and by mortgaging his estate to the sum of \u00a325,000.<ref>Gristwood 2007 pp. 307\u2013308; Hammer 2003 p. 125</ref>\n\nOn Thursday 9th December 1585, the Earl of Leicester set sail for the Low Countries from [[Harwich]] and landed after a swift crossing of less than 24 hours, the fleet anchored at Flushing ([[Vlissingen]]). At the end of December 1585 Leicester was received in the Netherlands, according to one correspondent, in the manner of a second [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]; a Dutch town official already noted in his minute-book that the Earl was going to have \"absolute power and authority\".<ref name=\"Strong and van Dorsten 1964 p. 53\">Strong and van Dorsten 1964 p. 53</ref> After a progress through several cities and so many festivals he arrived in [[The Hague]], where on 1&nbsp;January 1586 he was urged to accept the title governor-general by the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] of the United Provinces. Leicester wrote to Burghley and Walsingham, explaining why he believed the Dutch importunities should be answered favourably. He accepted his elevation on 25&nbsp;January, having not yet received any communications from England due to constant adverse winds.<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 276\u2013278</ref>\n\nThe Earl had now \"the rule and government general\" with a [[Council of State (Netherlands)#Under_Anjou_and_Leicester|Council of State]] to support him (the members of which he nominated himself).<ref>Strong and van Dorsten 1964 pp. 55, 73</ref> He remained a subject of Elizabeth, making it possible to contend that she was now [[wikt:sovereign|sovereign]] over the Netherlands. According to Leicester, this was what the Dutch desired.<ref>Strong and van Dorsten 1964 p. 54</ref> From the start such a position for him had been implied in the Dutch propositions to the English, and in their instructions to Leicester; and it was consistent with the Dutch understanding of the Treaty of Nonsuch.<ref>Haynes 1987 pp. 158\u2013159; Bruce 1844 p. 17; Strong and van Dorsten 1964 pp. 23, 25</ref> The English queen, however, in her instructions to Leicester, had expressly declined to accept offers of sovereignty from the United Provinces while still demanding of the States to follow the \"advice\" of her lieutenant-general in matters of government.<ref>Bruce 1844 p. 15</ref> Her ministers on both sides of the [[English Channel|Channel]] hoped she would accept the situation as a ''fait accompli'' and could even be persuaded to add the rebellious provinces to her possessions.<ref name=\"Strong and van Dorsten 1964 p. 53\"/> Instead her fury knew no bounds and Elizabeth sent [[Sir Thomas Heneage]] to read out her letters of disapproval before the States General, Leicester having to stand nearby.<ref>Gristwood 2007 pp. 311, 313; Chamberlin 1939 p. 263</ref> Elizabeth's \"commandment\"<ref>Bruce 1844 p. 105</ref> was that the Governor-General immediately resign his post in a formal ceremony in the same place where he had taken it.<ref>Gristwood 2007 p. 313</ref> After much pleading with her and protestations by the Dutch, it was postulated that the governor-generalship had been bestowed not by any sovereign, but by the States General and thereby by the people.<ref>Strong and van Dorsten 1964 p. 59</ref> The damage was done, however:<ref>Hammer 2003 p. 127</ref> \"My credit hath been cracked ever since her Majesty sent Sir Thomas Heneage hither\", Leicester recapitulated in October 1586.<ref>Bruce 1844 p. 424</ref>\n\n[[File:Emanuel-van-Meteren-Historien-der-Nederlanden-tot-1612 MG 9971.tif|thumb|left|Engraving of Robert Dudley as Governor-General, on horseback]]\n\nElizabeth demanded of her Lieutenant-General to refrain at all cost from any decisive action with Parma, which was the opposite of what Leicester wished and what the Dutch expected of him.<ref>Strong and van Dorsten 1964 p. 72</ref> After some initial successes,<ref>Gristwood 2007 pp. 316\u2013317</ref> the unexpected surrender of the [[Siege of Grave (1586)|strategically important town of Grave]] was a serious blow to English morale. Leicester's fury turned on the town's governor, Baron Hemart, whom he had executed despite all pleadings. The Dutch nobility were astonished: even the Prince of Orange would not have dared such an outrage, Leicester was warned; but, he wrote, he would not be intimidated by the fact that Hemart \"was of a good house\".<ref>Bruce 1844 p. 309; Wilson 1981 pp. 282\u2013284</ref>\n\nLeicester's forces, small and seriously underfinanced from the outset, faced the most formidable army in Europe.<ref>Adams 2002 p. 147; Gristwood 2007 p. 307; Hammer 2003 pp. 125\u2013126</ref> Unity among their ranks was at risk by Leicester's and the other officers' quarrels with [[John Norreys|Sir John Norris]], who had commanded previous English contingents in the Netherlands and was now the Earl's deputy.<ref>Adams 2002 p. 180; Hammer 2003 p. 126</ref> Elizabeth was angry that the war cost more than anticipated and for many months delayed sending money and troops.<ref>Hammer 2003 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> This not only forced Dudley to raise further funds on his own account, but much aggravated the soldiers' lot.<ref>Wilson 1981 p. 282; Hammer 2003 p. 133</ref> \"They cannot get a penny; their credit is spent; they perish for want of victuals and clothing in great numbers ...

On Elizabeth's orders Leicester enforced a ban on this trade with the enemy, thus alienating the wealthy Dutch merchants.<ref>Haynes 1987 pp. 172\u2013173; Adams 2008b</ref> He also effected a fiscal reform. In order to centralise finances and to replace the highly corrupt [[tax farming]] with [[direct taxation]], a new Council of Finances was established which was not under supervision of the Council of State.

The contestants in turn each receive 5 questions regarding their specialist subject areas (\"The Experts' Round\"), followed by questions from a subject Gleeson chooses (\"Tom's Round\") and then [[general knowledge]] questions (\"The People's Round\"). Contestants receive 5 points for answering a question correctly, and lose 5 points for answering a question incorrectly.  During the Experts' Round, a contestant may attempt to answer a question from another contestant's subject area. This is known as \"The Steal\". If a Steal is successful, the contestant receives 10 points but will only lose 5 points for an incorrect Steal attempt (in series 1, a failed Steal resulted in the contestant losing 10 points).  The contestant with the lowest score at the end of both the Experts Round and The People's Round are eliminated from the show. In the event of a tie for lowest scorer, the tie is broken with a Hard-Off, where Gleeson presents two options for a given question (often pertaining to the relative difficulty of two given tasks or physical hardness of two materials), which the first contestant to buzz in then answers. If the answering contestant chooses correctly, the other contestant is eliminated and vice versa if the answer given is incorrect. The final two contestants answer questions regarding their chosen subject area in a best of 5 [[penalty shootout]]-style format, with the winner receiving a trophy \u2013 the Hard Quiz Big Brass Mug.\n\n==Series Overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color1     = skyblue\n| link1      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 1 (2016)\n| episodes1  = 10\n| start1     = {{Start date|2016|10|19|df=y}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2016|12|21|df=y}}\n\n| color2     = orange\n| link2      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 2 (2017)\n| episodes2  = 18\n| start2     = {{Start date|2017|8|2|df=y}}\n| end2       = {{End date|2017|11|29|df=y}}\n\n| color3     = #C8A2C8\n| link3      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 3 (2018-19)\n| episodes3  = 22\n| start3     = {{Start date|2018|2|21|df=y}}\n| end3       = {{End date|2019|1|30|df=y}}\n\n| color4     = #FBCEB1\n| link4      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 4 (2019)\n| episodes4  = 20 + [[<includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#ep71|1 Special]]\n| start4     = {{Start date|2019|2|6|df=y}}\n| end4       = {{End date|2019|10|2|df=y}}\n\n| color5     = #9D296E\n| link5      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 5 (2020)\n| episodes5  = 40<ref name=\"TVBlackbox\" />\n| start5     = {{Start date|2020|2|5|df=y}}\n| end5       = \n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series 1 (2016)===\n\n''Names in '''Bold''' are the winners''\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=skyblue |overall=5 |title=16 |viewers=16 |airdate=16 |viewersT=Australian viewers |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| RTitle          = \"Episode 1\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|19|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 681,000<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Timeshifted: Wednesday 19 October 2016|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/10/timeshifted-wednesday-19-october-2016.html|website=TV Tonight|date=29 October 2016|accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Quizzers:<br>Sue -

The contestants in turn each receive 5 questions regarding their specialist subject areas (\"The Experts' Round\"), followed by questions from a subject Gleeson chooses (\"Tom's Round\") and then [[general knowledge]] questions (\"The People's Round\"). Contestants receive 5 points for answering a question correctly, and lose 5 points for answering a question incorrectly.  During the Experts' Round, a contestant may attempt to answer a question from another contestant's subject area. This is known as \"The Steal\". If a Steal is successful, the contestant receives 10 points but will only lose 5 points for an incorrect Steal attempt (in series 1, a failed Steal resulted in the contestant losing 10 points).  The contestant with the lowest score at the end of both the Experts Round and The People's Round are eliminated from the show. In the event of a tie for lowest scorer, the tie is broken with a Hard-Off, where Gleeson presents two options for a given question (often pertaining to the relative difficulty of two given tasks or physical hardness of two materials), which the first contestant to buzz in then answers. If the answering contestant chooses correctly, the other contestant is eliminated and vice versa if the answer given is incorrect. The final two contestants answer questions regarding their chosen subject area in a best of 5 [[penalty shootout]]-style format, with the winner receiving a trophy \u2013 the Hard Quiz Big Brass Mug.\n\n==Series Overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color1     = skyblue\n| link1      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 1 (2016)\n| episodes1  = 10\n| start1     = {{Start date|2016|10|19|df=y}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2016|12|21|df=y}}\n\n| color2     = orange\n| link2      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 2 (2017)\n| episodes2  = 18\n| start2     = {{Start date|2017|8|2|df=y}}\n| end2       = {{End date|2017|11|29|df=y}}\n\n| color3     = #C8A2C8\n| link3      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 3 (2018-19)\n| episodes3  = 22\n| start3     = {{Start date|2018|2|21|df=y}}\n| end3       = {{End date|2019|1|30|df=y}}\n\n| color4     = #FBCEB1\n| link4      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 4 (2019)\n| episodes4  = 20 + [[<includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#ep71|1 Special]]\n| start4     = {{Start date|2019|2|6|df=y}}\n| end4       = {{End date|2019|10|2|df=y}}\n\n| color5     = #9D296E\n| link5      = <includeonly>Hard Quiz</includeonly>#Series 5 (2020)\n| episodes5  = 40<ref name=\"TVBlackbox\" />\n| start5     = {{Start date|2020|2|5|df=y}}\n| end5       = \n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series 1 (2016)===\n\n''Names in '''Bold''' are the winners''\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=skyblue |overall=5 |title=16 |viewers=16 |airdate=16 |viewersT=Australian viewers |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| RTitle          = \"Episode 1\"\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|19|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 681,000<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Timeshifted: Wednesday 19 October 2016|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/10/timeshifted-wednesday-19-october-2016.html|website=TV Tonight|date=29 October 2016|accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Quizzers:<br>Sue -
