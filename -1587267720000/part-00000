The original show featured Crusty The Cat (the first character to face retirement as he was soon replaced with Mr. Munch in 1978), Pasqually the singing chef, Jasper T. Jowls, the Warblettes, and the main focus of the show, Chuck E.

The control system dubbed \"Cyberstar\" was re-designed from the ground up and produced by Dave Philipsen. In some markets, the company has also tried a new store concept that omits the animated show entirely. This is the Circle of Lights stage which either consists of a live Chuck E. Cheese costume character or an animatronic in a futuristic light stage with large television monitors. \n\nIn July 2012, the longstanding rat mascot was rebranded, changing to a slimmer rock star mouse who plays electric guitar. Voice actor [[Duncan Brannan]], who for 19 years had characterized Chuck E. Cheese as a wise-cracking rat from New Jersey, was replaced with [[Jaret Reddick]], the frontman and guitarist for the pop punk band [[Bowling for Soup]].<ref name=\"AP 2012\"/><ref>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chuck-e-cheese-makeover-duncan-brannan-jaret-reddick-344677</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the chain announced that animatronic shows would be removed in favor of a modernized dance floor.

The children must dance in order to win free tickets. The free tickets are thrown at the end of the performance for all the children that participated. Chuck comes out every hour on the half hour. The songs that he and the children dance to are usually well-known classic songs such as \"[[If You're Happy and You Know It]]\" and \"[[Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Chuck E.

The test location would no longer use tokens, and instead use a refillable card to access credits, which replace tokens, and points, which replace tickets. However, this was later scrapped. It was tested under different names, including \"Chuck E.'s Super Discount Card\" and \"Chuck E.

The control system dubbed \"Cyberstar\" was re-designed from the ground up and produced by Dave Philipsen. In some markets, the company has also tried a new store concept that omits the animated show entirely. This is the Circle of Lights stage which either consists of a live Chuck E.

The children must dance in order to win free tickets. The free tickets are thrown at the end of the performance for all the children that participated. Chuck comes out every hour on the half hour. The songs that he and the children dance to are usually well-known classic songs such as \"[[If You're Happy and You Know It]]\" and \"[[Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Chuck E.

Released in January 1977 as a double-LP as Grunt CYL2-1255, it is a compilation of Jefferson Airplane and Airplane-related tracks, including tracks by [[Jefferson Starship]] and [[Hot Tuna]], as well as solo tracks by [[Paul Kantner]], [[Grace Slick]], and [[Jorma Kaukonen]]. Although primarily a compilation album, the album includes one previously unreleased song: \"Please Come Back\" written by [[Ron Nagle]] and performed by Jefferson Starship.  \"Please Come Back\" is not available on any other release.\n\nAmong the session musicians featured on the album are two members of the [[Grateful Dead]] and one member of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash|Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].  David Crosby appears on one track, and [[Jerry Garcia]] plays on three tracks, two of which also feature [[Mickey Hart]].\n\nThe album included a lavish 12-page full-color, full-size (12 sq.in.) booklet, containing photographs of the band throughout the period covered by the compilation. It also contained a detailed history of the band, written by Patrick Snyder of [[Rolling Stone]] magazine.\n\n''Flight Log'' was first reissued on CD by BMG Japan on October 22, 2008 as a part of the \"Paper Sleeve Collection\" reissue series (BVCM-35468-9). The release features an exact reproduction of the Grunt 1977 edition of the LP packaging including a reduced scale reproduction of the original booklet and inner sleeve jackets for the CDs.  Also included is a second booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The only omission by BMG Japan was not reproducing the original GRUNT label on the CDs. The audio quality is as good as the original master tapes available for the Japanese LP pressing and features JVC K2 24 Bit Remastering. However, it sounds as if the master tapes had been damaged on at least three songs, and significantly obvious on the introduction of \"Silver Spoon\". CD 1 contains Side A and B, and CD 2 contains Side C and D.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, BGO Records released a remastered edition of Flight Log in a standard jewel case with cardboard slip cover. The BGO version is said to be a sonic improvement on the BMG/Sony edition, nonetheless, certain tape defects such as on Silver Spoon still exist.\n\n==Track listing (with artist)==\n{{tracklist\n|

Released in January 1977 as a double-LP as Grunt CYL2-1255, it is a compilation of Jefferson Airplane and Airplane-related tracks, including tracks by [[Jefferson Starship]] and [[Hot Tuna]], as well as solo tracks by [[Paul Kantner]], [[Grace Slick]], and [[Jorma Kaukonen]]. Although primarily a compilation album, the album includes one previously unreleased song: \"Please Come Back\" written by [[Ron Nagle]] and performed by Jefferson Starship.  \"Please Come Back\" is not available on any other release.\n\nAmong the session musicians featured on the album are two members of the [[Grateful Dead]] and one member of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash|Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].  David Crosby appears on one track, and [[Jerry Garcia]] plays on three tracks, two of which also feature [[Mickey Hart]].\n\nThe album included a lavish 12-page full-color, full-size (12 sq.in.) booklet, containing photographs of the band throughout the period covered by the compilation. It also contained a detailed history of the band, written by Patrick Snyder of [[Rolling Stone]] magazine.\n\n''Flight Log'' was first reissued on CD by BMG Japan on October 22, 2008 as a part of the \"Paper Sleeve Collection\" reissue series (BVCM-35468-9). The release features an exact reproduction of the Grunt 1977 edition of the LP packaging including a reduced scale reproduction of the original booklet and inner sleeve jackets for the CDs.  Also included is a second booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The only omission by BMG Japan was not reproducing the original GRUNT label on the CDs. The audio quality is as good as the original master tapes available for the Japanese LP pressing and features JVC K2 24 Bit Remastering. However, it sounds as if the master tapes had been damaged on at least three songs, and significantly obvious on the introduction of \"Silver Spoon\". CD 1 contains Side A and B, and CD 2 contains Side C and D.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, BGO Records released a remastered edition of Flight Log in a standard jewel case with cardboard slip cover. The BGO version is said to be a sonic improvement on the BMG/Sony edition, nonetheless, certain tape defects such as on Silver Spoon still exist.\n\n==Track listing (with artist)==\n{{tracklist\n|

Johnson]]. However, with the temporary demise of the recording industry in the [[Great Depression]], he was compelled to make a living outside music, working at one point in a steel mill in [[Peoria, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Devil\"/> In 1932 he moved again, to [[Cleveland]], Ohio, where he lived for the rest of the decade. There he performed on radio programs and intermittently played with the band backing the singer Putney Dandridge.<ref name=cohassey/>\n\nBy the late 1930s, he was recording and performing in Chicago for [[Decca Records]], working with [[Roosevelt Sykes]] and [[Blind John Davis]], among others. In 1939, during a session for [[Bluebird Records]] with the pianist [[Joshua Altheimer]], Johnson used an electric guitar for the first time.<ref name=\"manheim\"/> He recorded 34 tracks for Bluebird over the next five years, including the hits \"He's a Jelly Roll Baker\"<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books|location=Dubai|page=13|isbn=1-85868-255-X}}</ref> and \"In Love Again\".<ref name=cohassey/>\n\n===Later career===\n [[File:Lonnie Johnson at my place 1960.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Lonnie Johnson posing with his guitar|Johnson in 1960]]\nAfter World War II, Johnson made the transition to [[rhythm and blues]], recording for [[King Records (USA)|King]] in Cincinnati and having a hit in 1948 with \"[[Tomorrow Night (Coslow and Grosz song)|Tomorrow Night]]\" written by [[Sam Coslow]] and [[Wilhelm Grosz|Will Grosz]].

Tony Donegan, a British musician who played on the same bill, paid tribute to Johnson by changing his name to [[Lonnie Donegan]]. Johnson's performances are thought to have been received poorly by British audiences; this may have been due to organizational problems with the tour.<ref>{{cite web| title = On a Kind of Vacation: Re-examining African American Blues Musicians' Visits to Britain, 1950\u201358| first = Lawrence| last = Davies| publisher = allthirteenkeys.com| year = 2014| url = http://allthirteenkeys.wordpress.com/2014/06/22/on-a-kind-of-vacation-reexamining-african-american-blues-musicians-visits-to-britain-1950-58/| accessdate = October 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter returning to the United States, Johnson moved to Philadelphia. He worked in a steel foundry and as a janitor. In 1959 he was working at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel in Philadelphia in 1959 when WHAT-FM disc jockey [[Chris Albertson]] located him and produced  ''[[Blues by Lonnie Johnson]]'' for [[Bluesville Records]]. This was followed by other Prestige albums, including one (''[[Blues & Ballads]]'') with the former Ellington boss [[Elmer Snowden]], who had helped Albertson locate Johnson. Snowden had been the original bandleader of the Washingtonians, which Ellington took over after Snowden vacated the position and made into the famous Ellington orchestra. There followed a Chicago engagement for Johnson at the Playboy Club. This succession of events placed him back on the music scene at a fortuitous time: young audiences were embracing folk music, and many veteran performers were stepping out of obscurity. Johnson was reunited with Duke Ellington and appeared as a guest at an all-star folk concert.\n\nIn 1961, Johnson was reunited with his Okeh recording partner Victoria Spivey for another Prestige album, ''Idle Hours'', and the two singers performed at [[Gerdes Folk City]]. In 1963 he toured Europe as part of the [[American Folk Blues Festival]] with [[Muddy Waters]] and others and recorded an album with [[Otis Spann]] in Denmark.\n\nIn May 1965, he performed at a club in Toronto before an audience of four people.<ref name=obit>Campbell, Richard, \"A Legend of Jazz World, Lonnie Johnson Dies\". ''[[Toronto Star]]''. June 17, 1970. p. 50.</ref> Two weeks later, his shows at a different club attracted a larger audience, and Johnson, encouraged by Toronto's relative racial harmony, decided to move to the city. He opened his club, Home of the Blues, on Toronto's [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville Avenue]] in 1966, but it was a business failure, and Johnson was fired by the man who became owner.<ref name=obit/> Through the rest of the decade, he recorded, played clubs in Canada, and embarked on several regional tours.<ref name=cohassey/>\n\nIn March 1969 he was hit by a car while walking on a sidewalk in Toronto.<ref>\"Jazzman Johnson Injured in Crash\". ''[[Toronto Star]]''. March 14, 1969. p. 26.</ref> He was seriously injured, suffering a broken hip and kidney injuries.

He had been featured on several compilation blues albums from Folkways, beginning in the 1960s, but never released a solo album on the label in his lifetime.\n\nJohnson was posthumously inducted into the [[Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame]] in 1997.\n\n==Influence==\nJohnson's early recordings are the first guitar recordings that display a single-note soloing style with string bending and vibrato. Johnson pioneered this style of guitar playing on records, and his influence is obvious in the playing of [[Django Reinhardt]], [[T-Bone Walker]] and virtually all electric blues guitarists.\n\nOne of [[Elvis Presley]]'s earliest recordings was a version of Johnson's [[blues ballad]] \"Tomorrow Night\", written by Sam Coslow and Will Grosz. Presley's vocal phrasing mimics Johnson's, and many of Presley's signature vibrato and baritone sounds can be heard in development. \"Tomorrow Night\" was also recorded by [[LaVern Baker]] and (in 1957) by [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].\n\nIn the liner notes for the album ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]'', [[Bob Dylan]] described his encounters with Johnson in New York City. \"I was lucky to meet Lonnie Johnson at the same club I was working and I must say he greatly influenced me. You can hear it in that first record. I mean ''Corrina, Corrina''...that's pretty much Lonnie Johnson. I used to watch him every chance I got and sometimes he'd let me play with him. I think he and [[Tampa Red]] and of course [[Scrapper Blackwell]], that's my favorite style of guitar playing.\"<ref>Crowe, Cameron (1985). Liner notes, ''Biograph''. Columbia Records. 10.</ref> In his autobiography, ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1]]'', Dylan wrote about the performing method he learned from [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] and remarked that Robert Johnson had learned a lot from Lonnie Johnson. Some of Robert Johnson's songs are seen as new versions of songs recorded by Lonnie Johnson.\n\n==Discography==\n===As leader===\n* ''Lonesome Road'' (King, 1958)\n* ''[[Blues by Lonnie Johnson]]''  (Prestige Bluesville, 1960)\n* ''[[Blues & Ballads]]'' (Prestige Bluesville, 1960)\n* ''[[Losing Game]]'' (Prestige Bluesville, 1961)\n* ''[[Idle Hours (album)|Idle Hours]]'' (Prestige Bluesville, 1962)\n* ''Another Night to Cry'' (Prestige Bluesville, 1962)\n* ''Eddie Lang & Lonnie Johnson Vol. 1'' (Swaggie, 1967)\n* ''Eddie Lang & Lonnie Johnson Vol. 2'' (Swaggie, 1970)\n* ''Mr. Trouble'' (Folkways, 1982)\n* ''Tears Don't Fall No More'' (Folkways, 1982)\n* ''Blues, Ballads, and Jumpin' Jazz Vol. 2'' (Prestige Bluesville, 1990)\n* ''The Complete Folkways Recordings'' (Smithsonian Folkways, 1993)\n* ''The Unsung Blues Legend'' (Blues Magnet 2000)\n\n===As sideman===\n* [[Victoria Spivey]], ''Woman Blues]'' (Prestige Bluesville, 1962)\n* Victoria Spivey, ''The Queen and Her Knights'' (Spivey 1965)\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[List of jazz musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Lonnie Johnson}}\n* {{Britannica|305358|Lonnie Johnson}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170608004914/http://redhotjazz.com/ljohnson.html Discography and brief biography]\n*[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000968/Lonnie-Johnson.html Biography]\n\n{{Blues|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Johnson, Lonnie}}\n[[Category:1899 births]]\n[[Category:1970 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century violinists]]\n[[Category:African-American jazz guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American jazz guitarists]]\n[[Category:American jazz violinists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:Blues musicians from New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Blues revival musicians]]\n[[Category:Country blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Gennett Records artists]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Jazz musicians from New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Jazz-blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male violinists]]\n[[Category:Okeh Records artists]]\n[[Category:Piedmont blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Singers from Louisiana]]\n[[Category:St. Louis blues musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:Male jazz musicians]]\n[[Category:Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five members]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|Lonnie Johnson (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name                = Lonnie Johnson\n| image               = LonnieJohnsonByRussellLee1941Crop.jpg\n| caption             = Johnson in Chicago, 1941\n| image_size          = \n| background          = solo_singer\n| birth_name          = Alonzo Johnson\n| birth_date          = {{Birth date|1899|2|8}}\n| death_date          = {{Death date and age|1970|6|16|1899|2|8}}\n| birth_place  =              [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, U.S.\n| death_place     = [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada\n| instrument          = Guitar, vocals, violin\n| genre               = [[St. Louis blues (music)|St. Louis blues]], [[country blues]], [[Piedmont blues]], [[jazz blues]]\n| years_active        = \n| label               = [[Okeh Records|Okeh]], [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]], [[King Records (USA)|King]], [[Bluesville Records|Bluesville]]\n}}\n'''Alonzo \"Lonnie\" Johnson''' (February 8, 1899<ref>There is some dispute over the year of his birth; 1894 is given on his passport.

''Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues''. {{ISBN|978-0-06-052427-2}}.</ref> declared that in the 1920s and 1930s Johnson was best known as a sophisticated and urbane singer rather than an instrumentalist: \"Of the forty ads for his records that appeared in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' between 1926 and 1931, not one even mentioned that he played guitar.\"\n\nJohnson's compositions often depicted the social conditions confronting urban African Americans (\"Racketeers' Blues\", \"Hard Times Ain't Gone Nowhere\", \"Fine Booze and Heavy Dues\").<ref name=\"Devil\"/> In his lyrics he captured the nuances of male-female love relationships in a way that went beyond [[Tin Pan Alley]] sentimentalism.<ref name=\"Devil\"/> His songs displayed an ability to understand the heartaches of others, which Johnson saw as the essence of his blues.<ref name=barlow/>\n\nAfter touring with [[Bessie Smith]] in 1929, Johnson moved to Chicago and recorded for Okeh with the stride pianist [[James P. Johnson]]. However, with the temporary demise of the recording industry in the [[Great Depression]], he was compelled to make a living outside music, working at one point in a steel mill in [[Peoria, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Devil\"/> In 1932 he moved again, to [[Cleveland]], Ohio, where he lived for the rest of the decade. There he performed on radio programs and intermittently played with the band backing the singer Putney Dandridge.<ref name=cohassey/>\n\nBy the late 1930s, he was recording and performing in Chicago for [[Decca Records]], working with [[Roosevelt Sykes]] and [[Blind John Davis]], among others. In 1939, during a session for [[Bluebird Records]] with the pianist [[Joshua Altheimer]], Johnson used an electric guitar for the first time.<ref name=\"manheim\"/> He recorded 34 tracks for Bluebird over the next five years, including the hits \"He's a Jelly Roll Baker\"<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books|location=Dubai|page=13|isbn=1-85868-255-X}}</ref> and \"In Love Again\".<ref name=cohassey/>\n\n===Later career===\n [[File:Lonnie Johnson at my place 1960.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Lonnie Johnson posing with his guitar|Johnson in 1960]]\nAfter World War II, Johnson made the transition to [[rhythm and blues]], recording for [[King Records (USA)|King]] in Cincinnati and having a hit in 1948 with \"[[Tomorrow Night (Coslow and Grosz song)|Tomorrow Night]]\" written by [[Sam Coslow]] and [[Wilhelm Grosz|Will Grosz]]. The topped the ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Race Records]] chart for 7 weeks and reached number 19 on the pop chart with sales of three million copies.<ref name=\"manheim\"/> A [[blues ballad]] with piano accompaniment and background singers, the song bore little resemblance to much of Johnson's earlier blues and jazz material. The follow-ups \"Pleasing You\", \"So Tired\", and \"Confused\" were also R&B hits.<ref>[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]]. ''Top R&B Singles 1942\u20131995''. {{ISBN|0-89820-115-2}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Johnson toured England. Tony Donegan, a British musician who played on the same bill, paid tribute to Johnson by changing his name to [[Lonnie Donegan]]. Johnson's performances are thought to have been received poorly by British audiences; this may have been due to organizational problems with the tour.<ref>{{cite web| title = On a Kind of Vacation: Re-examining African American Blues Musicians' Visits to Britain, 1950\u201358| first = Lawrence| last = Davies| publisher = allthirteenkeys.com| year = 2014| url = http://allthirteenkeys.wordpress.com/2014/06/22/on-a-kind-of-vacation-reexamining-african-american-blues-musicians-visits-to-britain-1950-58/| accessdate = October 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter returning to the United States, Johnson moved to Philadelphia. He worked in a steel foundry and as a janitor. In 1959 he was working at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel in Philadelphia in 1959 when WHAT-FM disc jockey [[Chris Albertson]] located him and produced  ''[[Blues by Lonnie Johnson]]'' for [[Bluesville Records]]. This was followed by other Prestige albums, including one (''[[Blues & Ballads]]'') with the former Ellington boss [[Elmer Snowden]], who had helped Albertson locate Johnson. Snowden had been the original bandleader of the Washingtonians, which Ellington took over after Snowden vacated the position and made into the famous Ellington orchestra. There followed a Chicago engagement for Johnson at the Playboy Club. This succession of events placed him back on the music scene at a fortuitous time: young audiences were embracing folk music, and many veteran performers were stepping out of obscurity. Johnson was reunited with Duke Ellington and appeared as a guest at an all-star folk concert.\n\nIn 1961, Johnson was reunited with his Okeh recording partner Victoria Spivey for another Prestige album, ''Idle Hours'', and the two singers performed at [[Gerdes Folk City]]. In 1963 he toured Europe as part of the [[American Folk Blues Festival]] with [[Muddy Waters]] and others and recorded an album with [[Otis Spann]] in Denmark.\n\nIn May 1965, he performed at a club in Toronto before an audience of four people.<ref name=obit>Campbell, Richard, \"A Legend of Jazz World, Lonnie Johnson Dies\". ''[[Toronto Star]]''. June 17, 1970. p. 50.</ref> Two weeks later, his shows at a different club attracted a larger audience, and Johnson, encouraged by Toronto's relative racial harmony, decided to move to the city. He opened his club, Home of the Blues, on Toronto's [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville Avenue]] in 1966, but it was a business failure, and Johnson was fired by the man who became owner.<ref name=obit/> Through the rest of the decade, he recorded, played clubs in Canada, and embarked on several regional tours.<ref name=cohassey/>\n\nIn March 1969 he was hit by a car while walking on a sidewalk in Toronto.<ref>\"Jazzman Johnson Injured in Crash\". ''[[Toronto Star]]''. March 14, 1969. p. 26.</ref> He was seriously injured, suffering a broken hip and kidney injuries. A benefit concert was held on May 4, 1969, with two dozen acts that included [[Ian and Sylvia]], [[John Lee Hooker]], and [[Hagood Hardy]].<ref>Rubin, Don. \"One of the Best Jazz Shows Ever.\" ''Toronto Star''. May 5, 1969. p. 28.</ref> He never fully recovered from his injuries and suffered what was described as a stroke. He was able to return to the stage for one performance at [[Massey Hall]] on February 23, 1970, walking with the aid of a cane, to sing a couple songs with [[Buddy Guy]]; Johnson received a standing ovation.<ref>McCracken, Melinda. \"Blues Show Turns Them On.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. February 24, 1970. p. 13.</ref>\n\nJohnson died on June 16, 1970. A funeral was held at [[Mount Hope Catholic Cemetery|Mount Hope Cemetery]] in Toronto by his friends and fellow musicians, but his family members insisted on transferring the body to Philadelphia where he was buried.<ref name=obit/><ref>Miller, Mark (2011). ''Way Down That Lonesome Road: Lonnie Johnson in Toronto 1965\u20131970''. Mercury Press & Teksteditions. pp. 129, 145.</ref> He was \"virtually broke.\"<ref name=obit/> The Killer Blues Headstone project, a nonprofit organization that places headstones on unmarked graves of blues musicians, purchased a headstone for Johnson around 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Non-Profit to Help Bluesman with Unmarked Graves|website=Killer Blues|publisher=Killer Blues Headstone Project.

He had been featured on several compilation blues albums from Folkways, beginning in the 1960s, but never released a solo album on the label in his lifetime.\n\nJohnson was posthumously inducted into the [[Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame]] in 1997.\n\n===Biopic depiction===\nJohnson is a character in ''[[Who Do You Love? (2008 film)|Who Do You Love?]]'' (2008), a feature film that dramatised the life of [[Leonard Chess]], starring [[Alessandro Nivola]], [[David Oyelowo]] and [[TJ Hassan]] as Johnson. The film was directed by Jerry Zaks.\n\n==Discography==\n* ''Lonesome Road'' (King, 1958)\n* ''[[Blues by Lonnie Johnson]]''  (Prestige Bluesville, 1960)\n* ''[[Blues & Ballads]]'' (Prestige Bluesville, 1960)\n* ''[[Losing Game]]'' (Prestige Bluesville, 1961)\n* ''[[Idle Hours (album)|Idle Hours]]'' (Prestige Bluesville, 1962)\n* ''Another Night to Cry'' (Prestige Bluesville, 1962)\n* ''Eddie Lang & Lonnie Johnson Vol. 1'' (Swaggie, 1967)\n* ''Eddie Lang & Lonnie Johnson Vol. 1'' (Swaggie, 1970)\n* ''Mr. Trouble'' (Folkways, 1982)\n* ''Tears Don't Fall No More'' (Folkways, 1982)\n* ''Blues, Ballads, and Jumpin' Jazz Vol. 2'' (Prestige Bluesville, 1990)\n* ''The Complete Folkways Recordings'' (Smithsonian Folkways, 1993)\n* ''The Unsung Blues Legend'' (Blues Magnet 2000)\n\n===As sideman===\n* [[Victoria Spivey]], ''Woman Blues]'' (Prestige Bluesville, 1962)\n* Victoria Spivey, ''The Queen and Her Knights'' (Spivey 1965)\n\n==Influence==\nJohnson's early recordings are the first guitar recordings that display a single-note soloing style with string bending and vibrato. Johnson pioneered this style of guitar playing on records, and his influence is obvious in the playing of [[Django Reinhardt]], [[T-Bone Walker]] and virtually all electric blues guitarists.\n\nOne of [[Elvis Presley]]'s earliest recordings was a version of Johnson's [[blues ballad]] \"Tomorrow Night\", written by Sam Coslow and Will Grosz. Presley's vocal phrasing mimics Johnson's, and many of Presley's signature vibrato and baritone sounds can be heard in development. \"Tomorrow Night\" was also recorded by [[LaVern Baker]] and (in 1957) by [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].\n\nIn the liner notes for the album ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]'', [[Bob Dylan]] described his encounters with Johnson in New York City. \"I was lucky to meet Lonnie Johnson at the same club I was working and I must say he greatly influenced me. You can hear it in that first record. I mean ''Corrina, Corrina''...that's pretty much Lonnie Johnson. I used to watch him every chance I got and sometimes he'd let me play with him. I think he and [[Tampa Red]] and of course [[Scrapper Blackwell]], that's my favorite style of guitar playing.\"<ref>Crowe, Cameron (1985). Liner notes, ''Biograph''. Columbia Records. 10.</ref> In his autobiography, ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1]]'', Dylan wrote about the performing method he learned from [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] and remarked that Robert Johnson had learned a lot from Lonnie Johnson. Some of Robert Johnson's songs are seen as new versions of songs recorded by Lonnie Johnson.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of blues musicians]]\n*[[List of jazz musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Lonnie Johnson}}\n* {{Britannica|305358|Lonnie Johnson}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170608004914/http://redhotjazz.com/ljohnson.html Discography and brief biography]\n*[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000968/Lonnie-Johnson.html Biography]\n\n{{Blues|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Johnson, Lonnie}}\n[[Category:1899 births]]\n[[Category:1970 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century violinists]]\n[[Category:African-American jazz guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American blues singers]]\n[[Category:American jazz guitarists]]\n[[Category:American jazz violinists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:Blues musicians from New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Blues revival musicians]]\n[[Category:Country blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Gennett Records artists]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Jazz musicians from New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Jazz-blues guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male violinists]]\n[[Category:Okeh Records artists]]\n[[Category:Piedmont blues musicians]]\n[[Category:Singers from Louisiana]]\n[[Category:St. Louis blues musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:Male jazz musicians]]\n[[Category:Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five members]]\n", "name_user": "Vmavanti", "label": "safe", "comment": "moved section, infobox changes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonnie_Johnson_(musician)"}

It stars [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Olivia Cooke]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Simon Pegg]], and [[Mark Rylance]]. It takes place in 2045, when much of humanity uses the [[virtual reality]] software OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation) to escape the desolation of the real world. Orphaned teenager Wade Watts (Sheridan) finds clues to a hidden game that promises OASIS's ownership to the winner, and he and four allies try to complete it before a corporation run by businessman Nolan Sorrento (Mendelsohn) can do so.\n\n''Ready Player One'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on March 11, 2018, and was theatrically released by [[Warner Bros.]] Pictures in the United States on March 29, 2018, in 2D, [[RealD 3D]], [[IMAX]] and IMAX 3D. It grossed over $582 million and received generally positive reviews; critics praised its visuals, brisk pacing, the performances of Sheridan and Rylance, and the many cultural references from various media. The film was noted to have significant differences from the book; some critics said the film's plot was an improvement over the source material.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uploadvr.com/ready-player-one-movie-review-roundup-another-spielberg-classic/|title=Ready Player One Movie Review Roundup: Another Spielberg Classic?|first1=David|last1=Jagneaux|work=[[UploadVR]]|date=March 13, 2018|accessdate=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327144838/https://uploadvr.com/ready-player-one-movie-review-roundup-another-spielberg-classic/#|archive-date=March 27, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ready-player-one-review-roundup,news-26776.html|title=Ready Player One Review Roundup: Pretty, Flawed|first1=Henry T.|last1=Casey|work=Tom's Guide|publisher=[[Purch Group]]|date=March 14, 2018|accessdate=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326202506/https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ready-player-one-review-roundup,news-26776.html#|archive-date=March 26, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It also received nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]], [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]], and [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]], all for visual effects.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2045, people seek regular escape from life through the [[virtual reality]] entertainment universe called OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), co-created by James Halliday and Ogden Morrow of Gregarious Games. After Halliday's death, a pre-recorded message left by his [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] Anorak announces a game, granting ownership of OASIS to the first to find the Golden [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] within it, which is locked behind a gate requiring three keys which players can obtain by accomplishing three challenges.\n\nThe contest has lured a number of 'Gunters', or egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento, the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI) who seeks to control OASIS himself in order to insert intrusive [[online advertising]]. IOI uses a number of [[indentured servants]] as well as an army of employees called \"Sixers\" to find the egg.{{efn|IOI employees are called Sixers because their employee IDs are six digits long and begin with the number 6.}}\n\nWade Watts is an orphaned teenager living in the slums, or 'Stacks', of [[Columbus, Ohio]], with his Aunt Alice and her abusive boyfriend, Rick. In the OASIS, his avatar Parzival is best friends with Aech, a virtual mechanic. Wade (as the film's narrating voice) explains that the First Quest of the Hunt to the egg was discovered long before by an unnamed Gunter as a [[Driving simulator|simulated car and motorbike race]] in a recreation of [[Manhattan]] filled with [[Kaiju|movie monsters]] and other dangers. Numerous people participate every day (including Parzival on a modified [[DeLorean time machine]] and Aech on a [[Bigfoot (truck)|Bigfoot]] [[monster truck]]), but no one is able to finish the race due to an apparently invincible [[King Kong]] [[Boss (video games)|boss]] at the end of the track. One day, at the race, Wade meets [[Internet celebrity]] Art3mis and saves her from being \"zeroed out\" (dying in-game, which would result in losing all of her avatar's properties) and they start a friendship. Later, while consulting Halliday's ([[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]) Journals with their Curator, Parzival discovers [[Thinking outside the box|an unorthodox way to win]] the race, but is seen by Art3mis and tells it to Aech, who, in turn, tells it to his friends Daito and Sho.\n\nSorrento learns of Parzival's real-life identity through OASIS mercenary i-R0k, and attempts to sway Wade into joining IOI, but he refuses. In retaliation, Sorrento has IOI's head of operations F'Nale Zandor bomb Wade's stack, killing Alice and Rick. Art3mis's player Samantha Cook rescues Wade and they commence a search for Kira in the Overlook Hotel from ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' to get the second key. They are soon found by IOI. Samantha is captured and remanded to one of IOI's Loyalty Centers to work off the debt IOI acquired. Wade is extracted by the other High Five\u2014Helen (Aech), Toshiro (Daito), and Zhou (Sho). The group tracks down Samantha's location at IOI and they remotely help her escape, allowing her to assist them in the OASIS as Art3mis. \n\nThe third challenge requires one to play Halliday's favorite [[Atari 2600]] game, in a castle on [[Voltron|Planet Doom]], which Sorrento has protected with a force field emitted by a magical in-game artifact called the Orb of Osuvox. Parzival recruits other OASIS players to help the rebels attack the IOI forces around the castle. Art3mis deactivates the force field, allowing Parzival to reach the console. After a brief fight, Sorrento detonates a bomb called the Cataclyst that kills all the avatars on Planet Doom. However, due to having won a coin from a bet with the Curator earlier, Parzival gets an [[extra life]], proceeding to play through ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' to find [[Adventure (Atari 2600)#Easter egg|its Easter egg]]; he is awarded the last key. He opens the gate and is greeted by Anorak and given a contract to sign. However, he recognizes it as the same contract Morrow signed to turn over his part of Gregarious and refuses. Anorak changes form, becomes Halliday, and reveals that the contract was the final test to make sure Parzival would not make the same mistakes he did. Parzival is given the Golden Egg and control of OASIS.\n\nIn the real world, Sorrento and Zandor fail to stop Parzival before he wins. After accepting defeat, they are quickly arrested for the bombing. Morrow, revealed to have been the Curator, offers his services to Wade and he gladly accepts. Wade decides to run OASIS with the other High Five, shutting it down twice a week to encourage people to spend more time in the real world. They also block loyalty centers from accessing the system, forcing the end of IOI's indentured servitude program. Meanwhile, Wade and Samantha start a relationship and move into a luxury apartment together.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--In order of end credits-->\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as Wade Watts / Parzival, a Gunter who wishes to win so he can leave the Stacks. Wade's avatar Parzival is a white-haired man with arm and facial tattoos.\n* [[Olivia Cooke]] as Samantha Cook / Art3mis, a well-known Gunter who works with various allies to ensure the OASIS is kept free and out of the hands of IOI, both inside the game and in the real world. Samantha has a birthmark around her right eye, which she is somewhat conscious of; her avatar Art3mis, a pink-skinned female humanoid with spiky hair, adopts this birthmark late in the film.\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Nolan Sorrento / IOI-655321, the [[CEO]] of Innovative Online Industries who seeks full control over the OASIS.\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Helen Harris / Aech, a Gunter and long-time friend of Wade's who works as a [[mechanic]] and [[Mod (video games)|modder]] in the OASIS and engages in [[Player versus player|PVP]] matches.

The Ludgate Hill Car Park lot on Lionel Street, in which caravan homes were partially built was also used and a planned explosion there caused some local business and homes to call emergency services, as no prior notification were given by the production team.

It stars [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Olivia Cooke]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Simon Pegg]], and [[Mark Rylance]]. It takes place in 2045, when much of humanity uses the [[virtual reality]] software OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation) to escape the desolation of the real world. Orphaned teenager Wade Watts (Sheridan) finds clues to a hidden game that promises OASIS's ownership to the winner, and he and four allies try to complete it before a corporation run by businessman Nolan Sorrento (Mendelsohn) can do so.\n\n''Ready Player One'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on March 11, 2018, and was theatrically released by [[Warner Bros.]] Pictures in the United States on March 29, 2018, in 2D, [[RealD 3D]], [[IMAX]] and IMAX 3D. It grossed over $582 million and received generally positive reviews; critics praised its visuals, brisk pacing, the performances of Sheridan and Rylance, and the many cultural references from various media. The film was noted to have significant differences from the book; some critics said the film's plot was an improvement over the source material.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uploadvr.com/ready-player-one-movie-review-roundup-another-spielberg-classic/|title=Ready Player One Movie Review Roundup: Another Spielberg Classic?|first1=David|last1=Jagneaux|work=[[UploadVR]]|date=March 13, 2018|accessdate=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327144838/https://uploadvr.com/ready-player-one-movie-review-roundup-another-spielberg-classic/#|archive-date=March 27, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ready-player-one-review-roundup,news-26776.html|title=Ready Player One Review Roundup: Pretty, Flawed|first1=Henry T.|last1=Casey|work=Tom's Guide|publisher=[[Purch Group]]|date=March 14, 2018|accessdate=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326202506/https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ready-player-one-review-roundup,news-26776.html#|archive-date=March 26, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It also received nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]], [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]], and [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]], all for visual effects.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2045, people seek regular escape from life through the [[virtual reality]] entertainment universe called OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), co-created by James Halliday and Ogden Morrow of Gregarious Games. After Halliday's death, a pre-recorded message left by his [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] Anorak announces a game, granting ownership of OASIS to the first to find the Golden [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] within it, which is locked behind a gate requiring three keys which players can obtain by accomplishing three challenges.\n\nThe contest has lured a number of 'Gunters', or egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento, the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI) who seeks to control OASIS himself in order to insert intrusive [[online advertising]]. IOI uses a number of [[indentured servants]] as well as an army of employees called \"Sixers\" to find the egg.{{efn|IOI employees are called Sixers because their employee IDs are six digits long and begin with the number 6.}}\n\nWade Watts is an orphaned teenager living in the slums, or 'Stacks', of [[Columbus, Ohio]], with his Aunt Alice and her abusive boyfriend, Rick. In the OASIS, his avatar Parzival is best friends with Aech, a virtual mechanic. Wade (as the film's narrating voice) explains that the First Quest of the Hunt to the egg was discovered long before by an unnamed Gunter as a [[Driving simulator|simulated car and motorbike race]] in a recreation of [[Manhattan]] filled with [[Kaiju|movie monsters]] and other dangers. Numerous people participate every day (including Parzival on a modified [[DeLorean time machine]] and Aech on a [[Bigfoot (truck)|Bigfoot]] [[monster truck]]), but no one is able to finish the race due to an apparently invincible [[King Kong]] [[Boss (video games)|boss]] at the end of the track. One day, at the race, Wade meets [[Internet celebrity]] Art3mis and saves her from being \"zeroed out\" (dying in-game, which would result in losing all of her avatar's properties) and they start a friendship. Later, while consulting Halliday's ([[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]) Journals with their Curator, Parzival discovers [[Thinking outside the box|an unorthodox way to win]] the race, but is seen by Art3mis and tells it to Aech, who, in turn, tells it to his friends Daito and Sho.\n\nSorrento learns of Parzival's real-life identity through OASIS mercenary i-R0k, and attempts to sway Wade into joining IOI, but he refuses. In retaliation, Sorrento has IOI's head of operations F'Nale Zandor bomb Wade's stack, killing Alice and Rick. Art3mis's player Samantha Cook rescues Wade and they commence a search for Kira in the Overlook Hotel from ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' to get the second key. They are soon found by IOI. Samantha is captured and remanded to one of IOI's Loyalty Centers to work off the debt IOI acquired. Wade is extracted by the other High Five\u2014Helen (Aech), Toshiro (Daito), and Zhou (Sho). The group tracks down Samantha's location at IOI and they remotely help her escape, allowing her to assist them in the OASIS as Art3mis. \n\nThe third challenge requires one to play Halliday's favorite [[Atari 2600]] game, in a castle on [[Voltron|Planet Doom]], which Sorrento has protected with a force field emitted by a magical in-game artifact called the Orb of Osuvox. Parzival recruits other OASIS players to help the rebels attack the IOI forces around the castle. Art3mis deactivates the force field, allowing Parzival to reach the console. After a brief fight, Sorrento detonates a bomb called the Cataclyst that kills all the avatars on Planet Doom. However, due to having won a coin from a bet with the Curator earlier, Parzival gets an [[extra life]], proceeding to play through ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' to find [[Adventure (Atari 2600)#Easter egg|its Easter egg]]; he is awarded the last key. He opens the gate and is greeted by Anorak and given a contract to sign. However, he recognizes it as the same contract Morrow signed to turn over his part of Gregarious and refuses. Anorak changes form, becomes Halliday, and reveals that the contract was the final test to make sure Parzival would not make the same mistakes he did. Parzival is given the Golden Egg and control of OASIS.\n\nIn the real world, Sorrento and Zandor fail to stop Parzival before he wins. After accepting defeat, they are quickly arrested for the bombing. Morrow, revealed to have been the Curator, offers his services to Wade and he gladly accepts. Wade decides to run OASIS with the other High Five, shutting it down twice a week to encourage people to spend more time in the real world. They also block loyalty centers from accessing the system, forcing the end of IOI's indentured servitude program. Meanwhile, Wade and Samantha start a relationship and move into a luxury apartment together.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--In order of end credits-->\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as Wade Watts / Parzival, a Gunter who wishes to win so he can leave the Stacks. Wade's avatar Parzival is a white-haired man with arm and facial tattoos.\n* [[Olivia Cooke]] as Samantha Cook / Art3mis, a well-known Gunter who works with various allies to ensure the OASIS is kept free and out of the hands of IOI, both inside the game and in the real world. Samantha has a birthmark around her right eye, which she is somewhat conscious of; her avatar Art3mis, a pink-skinned female humanoid with spiky hair, adopts this birthmark late in the film.\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Nolan Sorrento / IOI-655321, the [[CEO]] of Innovative Online Industries who seeks full control over the OASIS.\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Helen Harris / Aech, a Gunter and long-time friend of Wade's who works as a [[mechanic]] and [[Mod (video games)|modder]] in the OASIS and engages in [[Player versus player|PVP]] matches.

Miller]] as i-R0k, a freelance dealer and [[mercenary]] often employed by IOI. He shares his name with a minor character from the novel who unwillingly helps IOI discover the location of the First Quest, but is otherwise unrelated.\n* [[Simon Pegg]] as Ogden Morrow / Curator, a co-creator of the OASIS, who eventually left Gregarious Games. He is concerned that many people have developed an unhealthy dependency on the game. Odgen's avatar in this film is a [[Ask Jeeves|butler-styled]] [[robot]] that works in the Halliday Archives in the OASIS.\n* [[Mark Rylance]] as James Halliday / Anorak the All-Knowing, the deceased co-creator of the OASIS who reveals after his death that an Easter Egg is hidden in the OASIS that grants control over the OASIS to its winner. James' avatar is a hooded [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]].\n* Philip Zhao as Zhou / Sho, a Chinese Gunter and one of the \"High Five\". He is based upon Akihide \"Shoto\" Karatsu, a Japanese gunter<!---SIC---> featured in the novel. Zhou's avatar is a lizard-like [[ninja]].\n* [[Win Morisaki]] as Toshiro / Daito, a Japanese Gunter and one of the \"High Five\".

The chase was edited to make the street appear longer than it actually is. The backpackers hostel Hatters, also on Livery Street, was used for internal filming for a basement scene. The Ludgate Hill Car Park lot on Lionel Street, in which caravan homes were partially built was also used and a planned explosion there caused some local business and homes to call emergency services, as no prior notification were given by the production team. Other locations in the city included the former industrial area of [[Digbeth]], in a rooftop scene that overlooks the Birmingham City Centre skyline.

It remained an open-top furnace and did not have the ability to use the off-gases\u2014mainly carbon monoxide\u2014as a fuel for boilers or to heat the blast. It was thus more costly to operate than it should have been. The furnace only had one stove and so was not capable of applying the hot-blast continuously. It produced relatively expensive iron; in 1865 the landed cost of imported pig-iron was \u00a35 per ton, while that made at the works cost \u00a35 17s 6d.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nThere were problems with the operation of the blast furnace itself.

The coal was referred to as 'anthracite', perhaps because it was hard to ignite and would not form coke, or perhaps because anthracite coal had been used in other hot-blast blast furnaces without coking.

He also had the lower part of the furnace\u2014cracked and damaged during the previous furnace campaign\u2014repaired, in late 1868.

It remained an open-top furnace and did not have the ability to use the off-gases\u2014mainly carbon monoxide\u2014as a fuel for boilers or to heat the blast. It was thus more costly to operate than it should have been. The furnace only had one stove and so was not capable of applying the hot-blast continuously. It produced relatively expensive iron; in 1865 the landed cost of imported pig-iron was \u00a35 per ton, while that made at the works cost \u00a35 17s 6d.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nThere were problems with the operation of the blast furnace itself.

The coal was referred to as 'anthracite', perhaps because it was hard to ignite and would not form coke, or perhaps because anthracite coal had been used in other hot-blast blast furnaces without coking.

From 1 January 1893, the N.S.W. colonial government imposed a duty of 10 shillings per ton on imported pig-iron. There had been no significant amount of pig-iron smelted from ore in N.S.W. since 1882, and this tariff was an incentive to resume local production of pig-iron. The N.S.W. iron and steel industry benefitted from the influence of [[Protectionist Party|N.S.W politicians advocating protection]] \u2014such as [[George Dibbs]], [[William Lyne]] and [[John See]]\u2014over [[Free Trade Party|those advocating free-trade]] \u2014such as [[George Reid]]\u2014especially as the cost of locally rolled iron fell below the cost of imports for some types of wrought iron products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article156618090|title=ESKBANK IRONWORKS.|date=18 January 1894|work=National Advocate (Bathurst, NSW : 1889 - 1954)|access-date=1 June 2019|pages=2}}</ref><ref name=\":46\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13886459|title=THE IRON INDUSTRY.|date=1892-11-17|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=1 June 2019|pages=8}}</ref><ref name=\":47\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13910279|title=ESKBANK IRONWORKS.|date=16 January 1894|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=1 June 2019|pages=6}}</ref> N.S.W entered the new [[Commonwealth of Australia]] as the only state with a large scale iron and steel industry,<ref name=\":47\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14307744|title=PROTECTIONIST DELEGATES' VISIT TO LITHGOW.|date=25 April 1900|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=1 June 2019|pages=10}}</ref> and it remained so for the first four decades of the 20th-Century.\n\nThe change in government policy toward industry protection came far too late to assist the Fitzroy Iron Works, which had first proven that iron of a good quality could be made from local iron ore.<ref name=\":46\" /> The hard-won experience of Fitzroy Iron Works influenced later thinking on the siting of iron and steel works close to [[coking coal]] deposits and transport.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13256346|title=IRON; ITS MANUFACTURE; WHERE TO MAKE IT; AND HOW TO MAKE IT PAY.|date=24 April 1872|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=30 June 2019|pages=6}}</ref>\n\nThe Fitzroy Iron Works is commemorated by a memorial erected in 1948 at the site of the blast furnace<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22677975|title=Pioneers of Steel|date=23 October 1948|work=Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)|access-date=16 April 2019|pages=7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/technology/industry/display/22141-centenary-of-iron-smelting-works|title=Centenary of Iron Smelting Works|work=Monument Australia|access-date=3 May 2019}}</ref> and the remains of the iron works uncovered in 2004 with interpretive signage.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe only complete structure that is a remnant of the iron works is 'Ironstone Cottage', a sandstone cottage on the Old Hume Highway, which was once used by managers of the iron works.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Chalybeate Spring, Mittagong#Significance|The Chalybeate Spring and iron ore deposit at Mittagong]]\n* [[Lal Lal Iron Mine and Smelting Works]]\u2014 another 19th century iron mine and blast furnace, in Victoria.\n* [[Lithgow Blast Furnace#History|Lithgow Blast Furnace]]\u2014another 19th century blast furnace in New South Wales\n*[[Bogolong iron mine and blast furnace|Bogolong Iron Mine and Blast Furnace]] - another 19th century blast furnace in New South Wales\n*[[British and Tasmanian Charcoal Iron Company]]\u2014another 19th century iron mine and blast furnace, in Tasmania.\n*[[Tamar Hematite Iron Company]]\u2014another 19th century iron mine and blast furnace, in Tasmania.\n*[[Ilfracombe Iron Company]]\u2014another 19th century iron mine and blast furnace, in Tasmania.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Else-Mitchell|first=R.|title=Early Industries in the Mittagong District|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21523521|year=1981|publisher=Berrima District Historical Society|location=|isbn=0-9598208-7-6|pages=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=McKillop|first=R.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA, but different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> However, a 2020 analysis of ''H. antecessor'' enamel [[proteome]]s suggests that ''H. antecessor'' is related but not a direct ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Welker|display-authors=et al.|title=The dental proteome of ''Homo antecessor''|journal=Nature|year=2020|volume=580|issue=7802|pages=235\u2013238|doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2153-8|pmid = 32269345}}</ref> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 592\u2013182 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

Average [[body fat percentage]] (BFP) was estimated to be 25%, though it may have been 13% for males and 20% for females in more temperate areas. Using these measurements and average height and weight, the daily [[total energy expenditure]] (TEE)\u2014the amount of calories consumed in one day\u2014was estimated to be 3,454\u20134,019 and 3,828\u20134,483 [[kcal]] for males with high and low BFPs respectively, and 3,115\u20133,538 and 3,258\u20133,710 kcal for females. However, if the PAL was reduced to that of modern Siberian hunter-gatherers, the TEE becomes 2,959\u20133,524 and 3,333\u20133,988 kcal for males, and 2,620\u20133,043 and 2,764\u20133,215 kcal for females. This is comparable with the upper end of energetic demands of modern hunter gatherers, and the latter estimates are most similar to the Siberian [[Yakuts]], which contradicts earlier estimates of vastly higher energetic demands in Neanderthals than modern humans. Further, some Neanderthal populations are thought to have had a predominantly low-calorie plant diet, which suggests the minimum daily caloric intake was also low.<ref name=venner2018>{{cite thesis|first=S.

However, individuals with the 129 variant of the [[PRNP]] gene were naturally immune to the prions. Studying this gene led to the discovery that the 129 variant was widespread among all modern humans, which could indicate widespread cannibalism at some point in human prehistory. Because Neanderthals are known to have practised cannibalism to an extent and to have co-existed with modern humans, British palaeoanthropologist Simon Underdown speculated that modern humans transmitted a kuru-like spongiform disease to Neanderthals, and, because the 129 variant appears to have been absent in Neanderthals, it quickly killed them off.<ref name=underdown2008>{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Underdown|year=2008|title=A potential role for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in Neanderthal extinction|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=71|issue=1|pages=4\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2007.12.014|pmid=18280671}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Bello |first1= S.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools.

Average [[body fat percentage]] (BFP) was estimated to be 25%, though it may have been 13% for males and 20% for females in more temperate areas. Using these measurements and average height and weight, the daily [[total energy expenditure]] (TEE)\u2014the amount of calories consumed in one day\u2014was estimated to be 3,454\u20134,019 and 3,828\u20134,483 [[kcal]] for males with high and low BFPs respectively, and 3,115\u20133,538 and 3,258\u20133,710 kcal for females.

This is comparable with the upper end of energetic demands of modern hunter gatherers, and the latter estimates are most similar to the Siberian [[Yakuts]], which contradicts earlier estimates of vastly higher energetic demands in Neanderthals than modern humans.

However, individuals with the 129 variant of the [[PRNP]] gene were naturally immune to the prions. Studying this gene led to the discovery that the 129 variant was widespread among all modern humans, which could indicate widespread cannibalism at some point in human prehistory. Because Neanderthals are known to have practised cannibalism to an extent and to have co-existed with modern humans, British palaeoanthropologist Simon Underdown speculated that modern humans transmitted a kuru-like spongiform disease to Neanderthals, and, because the 129 variant appears to have been absent in Neanderthals, it quickly killed them off.<ref name=underdown2008>{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Underdown|year=2008|title=A potential role for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in Neanderthal extinction|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=71|issue=1|pages=4\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2007.12.014|pmid=18280671}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Bello |first1= S.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained.

Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G.

As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of language is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations. The internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Wates and Brian MacWhinney, the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

In other words, children have only heard a finite number of sentences, but they are able to comprehend and produce an infinite number of sentences. This argument is often used to argue against the [[usage-based linguistics|usage-based]] approach of language acquisition, which denies the necessity of UG and argues children can learn languages through their general cognitive and social skills,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|date=2005-01-12|title=Beyond formalities: The case of language acquisition|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2\u20134|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.183|issn=0167-6318}}</ref> as it is able to account for the use of grammar that the child is not exposed to.\n\nIn the following sections, some of the aspects of language that develop will be discussed from a biolinguistic stand-point. These areas will draw similarities to language acquisition and UG.\n\n===Typology===\n\n{{Main|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology is the analysis, comparison, and classification of languages according to their common structural features and forms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Linguistic typology |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-linguistic-typology-1691129 |date=19 February 2019}}</ref> Linguistic typology studies and classifies languages according to their structural features, and it aims to describe and explain the structural diversity and similarity in the languages of the world.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=English Language and Linguistics Online |title=Linguistic typology & typological universals |url=http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/CognitiveApproaches/LinguisticTypologyAndTypologicalUniversals}}</ref>\n\nThe study of linguistic typology is thus in line with the goal of biolinguists in language acquisition as mentioned previously. It also draws comparisons with UG in the sense that they both seek to identify the similarities and differences in the languages of the world. There is some evidence from this field that suggests that the structure of the world's languages may not be completely random from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistc]] point of view <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |title=The impact of language contact and social structure on linguistic structure: Focus on the dialects of modern Greek |journal=Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar from a Cross-linguistic Perspective |date=2004 |volume=153 |pages=435\u2013452}}</ref> and this supports the view of UG.\n\nSome of the areas that linguistic typology looks at are:\n*[[Phonology|Phonological systems]]\n*Word order\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*Semantics<ref>Kemp, Charles & Xu, Yang & Regier, Terry (2018). \"Semantic Typology and Efficient Communication\". ''Annual Review of Linguistics''. '''4''': 109-128.</ref>\n\n===Syntax===\n\n{{Main|Syntax}}\n\nSyntax is the part of the language that includes the rules that govern the grammatical organization of words and phrases. [[Generative grammar]] considers it the central object of the study and this is the only component of the human language that allows for creative properties.<ref name=Scianna>{{cite journal |last1=Scianna |first1=Caterina |title=The biolinguistic approach to the study of language nature |url=https://www.academia.edu/8452191}}</ref> It is because of this creativity allowed by syntax that provided the phrase, famously used by Chomsky, ''[[Colourless green ideas sleep furiously]]'' in his book [[Syntactic Structures]] which demonstrated a grammatically correct phrase that made no sense. This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n=== Biolinguistics: challenging the Usage-Based approach ===\nAs mentioned above, Biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the Biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078}}</ref>.\n\n==Researchers in Biolinguistics==\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Berlinski]], [[Discovery Institute]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[[Marc D.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained.

Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from American linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism.

Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G.

As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of language is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations. The internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Wates and Brian MacWhinney, the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

This human biological endowment for language acquisition is known as [[Universal Grammar|Universal Grammar (UG)]], which is also considered as the initial state of the Language Acquisition Device.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crain |first1=Stephen |last2=Koring |first2=Loes |last3=Thornton |first3=Rosalind |title=Language acquisition from a biolinguistic perspective |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=2017 |volume=81 |issue=Pt B |pages=120\u2013149 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.004|pmid=27633153 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Berwick |first1=Robert C. |last2=Chomsky |first2=Noam |title=Why only us: Language and evolution |date=2016 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=9780262034241 |pages=89\u2013108}}</ref> UG contains core principles that are common to all languages and information on the ways that each language differs, and information on the language variations are encoded in parameters. As a result, UG can be summed up as a system of [[principles and parameters]], a model proposed by Chomsky. The goal of biolinguists, with regard to language acquisition, is to come up with the formulation of genetic principles of UG narrowly enough constrained to account for the child\u2019s ability to learn structural properties of grammar of great subtlety from impoverished linguistic data and at the same time, find parameters that can account for manifest variations among different languages.<ref name=\"Jenkins\">{{cite book |last1=Jenkins |first1=Lyle |title=Biolinguistics: Exploring the biology of language |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York, NY |pages=76\u2013108}}</ref>\n\nSome of the areas of study of language acquisition include:\n\n*Determine what the set of parameters are that are found in UG\n*[[Word order]]\n\nIn language acquisition, one of the arguments supporting the biolinguistic view is [[poverty of the stimulus]],<ref name=\"project muse\" /><ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> a term coined by Chomsky in 1980, which contends that the linguistic environment that children are exposed to is not rich enough to account for all the information that they have acquired. In other words, children have only heard a finite number of sentences, but they are able to comprehend and produce an infinite number of sentences. This argument is often used to argue against the [[usage-based linguistics|usage-based]] approach of language acquisition, which denies the necessity of UG and argues children can learn languages through their general cognitive and social skills,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|date=2005-01-12|title=Beyond formalities: The case of language acquisition|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2\u20134|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.183|issn=0167-6318}}</ref> as it is able to account for the use of grammar that the child is not exposed to.\n\nIn the following sections, some of the aspects of language that develop will be discussed from a biolinguistic stand-point. These areas will draw similarities to language acquisition and UG.\n\n===Typology===\n\n{{Main|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology is the analysis, comparison, and classification of languages according to their common structural features and forms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Linguistic typology |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-linguistic-typology-1691129 |date=19 February 2019}}</ref> Linguistic typology studies and classifies languages according to their structural features, and it aims to describe and explain the structural diversity and similarity in the languages of the world.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=English Language and Linguistics Online |title=Linguistic typology & typological universals |url=http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/CognitiveApproaches/LinguisticTypologyAndTypologicalUniversals}}</ref>\n\nThe study of linguistic typology is thus in line with the goal of biolinguists in language acquisition as mentioned previously. It also draws comparisons with UG in the sense that they both seek to identify the similarities and differences in the languages of the world. There is some evidence from this field that suggests that the structure of the world's languages may not be completely random from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistc]] point of view <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |title=The impact of language contact and social structure on linguistic structure: Focus on the dialects of modern Greek |journal=Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar from a Cross-linguistic Perspective |date=2004 |volume=153 |pages=435\u2013452}}</ref> and this supports the view of UG.\n\nSome of the areas that linguistic typology looks at are:\n*[[Phonology|Phonological systems]]\n*Word order\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*Semantics<ref>Kemp, Charles & Xu, Yang & Regier, Terry (2018). \"Semantic Typology and Efficient Communication\". ''Annual Review of Linguistics''. '''4''': 109-128.</ref>\n\n===Syntax===\n\n{{Main|Syntax}}\n\nSyntax is the part of the language that includes the rules that govern the grammatical organization of words and phrases. [[Generative grammar]] considers it the central object of the study and this is the only component of the human language that allows for creative properties.<ref name=Scianna>{{cite journal |last1=Scianna |first1=Caterina |title=The biolinguistic approach to the study of language nature |url=https://www.academia.edu/8452191}}</ref> It is because of this creativity allowed by syntax that provided the phrase, famously used by Chomsky, ''[[Colourless green ideas sleep furiously]]'' in his book [[Syntactic Structures]] which demonstrated a grammatically correct phrase that made no sense. This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n=== Biolinguistics: challenging the Usage-Based approach ===\nAs mentioned above, Biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the Biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078}}</ref>.\n\n==Researchers in Biolinguistics==\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Berlinski]], [[Discovery Institute]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[[Marc D.

The band had maintained its original lineup until keyboardist James Baney left the band. To date, the group has released seven full-length albums: ''[[Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord]]'' (2006),  ''[[Plagues (album)|Plagues]]'' (2007), ''[[With Roots Above and Branches Below]]'' (2009), ''[[Dead Throne]]'' (2011), ''[[8:18]]'' (2013) ''[[Transit Blues]]'' (2016), and ''[[The Act (album)|The Act]]'' (2019) as well as two EPs, one DVD, sixteen singles, and thirteen music videos.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and first releases (2005\u20132006)===\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada was founded during 2005 in [[Dayton Ohio]];<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p822710}}</ref> they derived their band name from [[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|the story of the same title]].<ref name=\"highwiredaze.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.highwiredaze.com/thedevilwearprada.htm|title=The Devil Wears Prada &gt; Biography|work=High Wire Daze|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226194455/http://www.highwiredaze.com/thedevilwearprada.htm|archivedate=February 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Being founded with all Christian members and maintaining a theme that represents their religion, the group played their first show in 2005 with a fill-in bassist and only one guitarist.

The band was unsatisfied with the demo so they re-recorded all of the tracks from the demo for their debut full-length album, ''[[Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord]]''. The album was recorded with [[Joey Sturgis]], at The Foundation Recording Studio held in [[Connersville, Indiana]] and it was released on August 22, 2006. The record's final track features guest vocals, courtesy of Cole Wallace who was formerly part of the band [[Gwen Stacy (band)|Gwen Stacy]]. With the release of the album, the band then began touring in multiple areas throughout the country, most notably at 2006's [[Cornerstone Festival]] after being recognized as a newer key musical group to Christian metal.\n\n===''Plagues'' (2006\u20132008)===\n[[File:TheDevilWearsPradaCornerstone.jpg|thumb|The Devil Wears Prada performing at [[Cornerstone Festival]], a [[Christian music festival]]]]\n\nWith ''Dear Love'' released at the end of the summer of 2006, The Devil Wears Prada already had songs for their second album prepared by winter of the same year. With a recording duration lasting from that time and leading into spring of 2007, the band's second album, ''[[Plagues (album)|Plagues]]'' met its completion by the summer and was released on August 21, 2007. The demo version of their song \"HTML Rulez D00d\" was placed on the band's Myspace profile on January 1, 2007 for promotion of the record and on July 11, [[AbsolutePunk]] began to stream their song \"Don't Dink and Drance\", which led to further exposure for the band.<ref name=\"AbsolutePunk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=250178|title=The Devil Wears Prada track listing |last=Foucart|first=Jon|work=[[AbsolutePunk]]}}</ref>\n\nThe songs from the album \"HTML Rulez D00d\" and \"Hey John, What's Your Name Again?\" were released as the album's two singles, both of which spawned music videos that aired on television channels such as MTV and [[Fuse TV|Fuse]].

Later in the year, the band was interviewed by East Coast Romper, and stated that their primary influences are [[Underoath]] and [[Still Remains]], which was mistaken on their official website due to it incorrectly stating that they were not influenced by these bands.

It consists of members Mike Hranica (vocals, additional guitar), Jeremy DePoyster (rhythm guitar, vocals), Kyle Sipress (lead guitar, backing vocals), Andy Trick (bass), Jonathan Gering (keyboards), and [[Giuseppe Capolupo]] (drums). The band had maintained its original lineup until keyboardist James Baney left the band. To date, the group has released seven full-length albums: ''[[Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord]]'' (2006),  ''[[Plagues (album)|Plagues]]'' (2007), ''[[With Roots Above and Branches Below]]'' (2009), ''[[Dead Throne]]'' (2011), ''[[8:18]]'' (2013) ''[[Transit Blues]]'' (2016), and ''[[The Act (album)|The Act]]'' (2019) as well as two EPs, one DVD, sixteen singles, and thirteen music videos.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and first releases (2005\u20132006)===\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada was founded during 2005 in [[Dayton Ohio]];<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p822710}}</ref> they derived their band name from [[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|the story of the same title]].<ref name=\"highwiredaze.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.highwiredaze.com/thedevilwearprada.htm|title=The Devil Wears Prada &gt; Biography|work=High Wire Daze|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226194455/http://www.highwiredaze.com/thedevilwearprada.htm|archivedate=February 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Being founded with all Christian members and maintaining a theme that represents their religion, the group played their first show in 2005 with a fill-in bassist and only one guitarist. Rhythm guitarist Jeremy Depoyster and bassist Andy Trick joined the band soon afterward.

The band was unsatisfied with the demo so they re-recorded all of the tracks from the demo for their debut full-length album, ''[[Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord]]''. The album was recorded with [[Joey Sturgis]], at The Foundation Recording Studio held in [[Connersville, Indiana]] and it was released on August 22, 2006. The record's final track features guest vocals, courtesy of Cole Wallace who was formerly part of the band [[Gwen Stacy (band)|Gwen Stacy]]. With the release of the album, the band then began touring in multiple areas throughout the country, most notably at 2006's [[Cornerstone Festival]] after being recognized as a newer key musical group to Christian metal.\n\n===''Plagues'' (2006\u20132008)===\n[[File:TheDevilWearsPradaCornerstone.jpg|thumb|The Devil Wears Prada performing at [[Cornerstone Festival]], a [[Christian music festival]]]]\n\nWith ''Dear Love'' released at the end of the summer of 2006, The Devil Wears Prada already had songs for their second album prepared by winter of the same year. With a recording duration lasting from that time and leading into spring of 2007, the band's second album, ''[[Plagues (album)|Plagues]]'' met its completion by the summer and was released on August 21, 2007. The demo version of their song \"HTML Rulez D00d\" was placed on the band's Myspace profile on January 1, 2007 for promotion of the record and on July 11, [[AbsolutePunk]] began to stream their song \"Don't Dink and Drance\", which led to further exposure for the band.<ref name=\"AbsolutePunk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=250178|title=The Devil Wears Prada track listing |last=Foucart|first=Jon|work=[[AbsolutePunk]]}}</ref>\n\nThe songs from the album \"HTML Rulez D00d\" and \"Hey John, What's Your Name Again?\" were released as the album's two singles, both of which spawned music videos that aired on television channels such as MTV and [[Fuse TV|Fuse]].

Later in the year, the band was interviewed by East Coast Romper, and stated that their primary influences are [[Underoath]] and [[Still Remains]], which was mistaken on their official website due to it incorrectly stating that they were not influenced by these bands.
