This group would play an outsize role in the accusations to come. \n\nTituba was part of a group of three women-- with [[Sarah Good]] and [[Sarah Osborne]]-- who were the very first to be arrested, on February 29, 1692, under the accusation that their specters (ghosts) were afflicting the young girls in Parris' household. The three women were questioned separately but were aware of each other and, in a classic [[prisoner's dilemma]], they were turned against each other. Sarah Good was the first interrogated and held to her innocence. [[John Hathorne|Judge Hathorne]] directed all \"the children... to look upon her and see if this were the person that hurt them... and they all did look upon her\" and claimed her specter tormented them. \"Sarah Good... why do you thus torment these poor children,\" Judge Hathorne asked. \"What do I know, you bring others here and now you charge me with it,\" Sarah Good responded. Next Judge Hathorne interrogated Sarah Osbourne, who claimed not to know Sarah Good or even her full name. But Hathorne said to her, \"Sarah Good saith that it was you that hurt the children.\" According to the transcript, this is a distortion of what Sarah Good had said, as she had only vaguely referred to the others without naming them, in a way that was only intended to deflect blame from herself. <ref>Rosenthal ''Records'' p. 127.</ref> Tituba was interrogated last and was the only of the three women to offer a full and elaborate confession against herself and pointing the finger of blame at the other two women: \"Sarah Good and Osbourne would have me hurt the children.\"<ref>Rosenthal ''Records'' p. 128.</ref> <ref name=salemuva>{{cite web|last=Yost|first=Melissa|title=Abigail Williams|url=http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/people?group.num=all&mbio.num=mb33|work=Salem Witch Trials Documentary Archive and Transcription Project|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=March 16, 2014|location=Charlottesville, Virginia|year=2002}}</ref> According to an investigation by [[Robert Calef]] that began soon after the trials, Tituba later recanted her confession as forced and claimed abuse from the slaveowner Parris:\n\n<blockquote><p>\"The account she [Tituba] since gives of it is that her master [Parris] did beat her and otherwise abuse her, to make her confess and accuse, such as he [Parris] called her 'sister-witches' and that whatever she said by way of confessing or accusing others, was the effect of such usage.\"<ref>Robert Calef, ''More Wonders of the Invisible World'' (1700) p. 91.

Sarah Osborne died in prison in May and Sarah Good was executed on July 19 along with four other women. Members of Parris household all managed to survive the entire episode including Tituba who was released from jail a year later, when the slaveowner Parris paid her prison fees and sold her.<ref>Games, Alison.

In the film, she was confirmed to be a witch who had both framed others and setup others to take the fall for her witchcraft to divert attention from herself, which resulted in the Salem Witch Trials. Her actions and crimes against humanity, coupled with her conspiracy with Horvath to release Morgana, caught the attention of Balthazar Blake, who seals her into the Grimhold so she can do no more harm. She was later released by Horvath to kidnap the main protagonist Dave's love interest, Becky Barnes, only for the former Merlinean fatally drained her of her magic once she completed the deed.\n\nAbigail is revealed as the antagonist of the 2014 video game ''[[Murdered: Soul Suspect]]''. In the story, flashbacks reveal that she was hanged for her part in the witch trials.

It is closely related to the [[Inuit languages]] in [[Canada]], such as [[Inuktitut]]. The main variety, [[Kalaallisut]], or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009; this is a move by the [[Naalakkersuisut]] (government of Greenland) to strengthen the language in its competition with the colonial language, [[Danish language|Danish]]. The second variety is [[Tunumiit language|Tunumiit oraasiat]], or East Greenlandic.  The Thule Inuit of Greenland, [[Inuktun]] or Polar Eskimo, is a recent arrival and a dialect of [[Inuktitut]].\n\nGreenlandic is a [[polysynthetic language]] that allows the creation of long words by stringing together [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] and [[suffix]]es. Its [[morphosyntactic alignment]] is [[Ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative]], meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument (\"subject\") of an intransitive verb like the object of a transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent (\"subject\") of a transitive verb. {{Example needed |date=August 2019}}\n\nNouns are inflected for one of the eight cases and for possession. Verbs are inflected for one of the eight [[Grammatical mood|moods]] and for the [[Grammatical number|number]] and [[Grammatical person|person]] of its [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|object]]. Both nouns and verbs have complex derivational morphology. Basic word order in [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitive]] [[clause]]s is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]. Subordination of clauses is done by the use of special subordinate moods. A so-called fourth-person category enables [[switch-reference]] between main clauses and subordinate clauses with different subjects. Greenlandic is notable for its lack of a system of [[grammatical tense]], as temporal relations are normally expressed through context, through the use of temporal particles such as \"yesterday\" or \"now\" or sometimes through the use of derivational suffixes or the combination of affixes with [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] meanings with the semantic [[lexical aspect|aktionsart]] of different verbs. However, some linguists have suggested that Greenlandic does mark future tense obligatorily. Another question is whether the language has [[Incorporation (linguistics)|noun incorporation]], or whether the processes that create complex predicates that include nominal roots are derivational in nature.\n\nWhen adopting new concepts or technologies, Greenlandic usually constructs new words made from Greenlandic roots, but modern Greenlandic has also taken many loans from Danish and [[English language|English]]. The language has been written in the Latin script since Danish colonization began in the 1700s. The first orthography was developed by [[Samuel Kleinschmidt]] in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because of a number of sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy, which is now among the highest in the world.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Inuktitut dialect map.svg|upright=1.6|right|thumb|Illustration 1: Distribution of Inuit language variants across the Arctic.]]\nThe Greenlandic language was brought to Greenland with the arrival of the [[Thule people]] in the 1200s. It is unknown which languages were spoken by the earlier [[Saqqaq culture|Saqqaq]] and [[Dorset culture]]s in Greenland.\n\nThe first descriptions of Greenlandic date from the 1600s, and with the arrival of Danish missionaries in the early 1700s, and the beginning of Danish colonialism in Greenland, the compilation of dictionaries and description of grammar began. The missionary [[Paul Egede]] wrote the first Greenlandic dictionary in 1750, and the first grammar in 1760.<ref name=\"encyc\" />\n\nFrom the Danish colonization in the 1700s to the beginning of Greenlandic home rule in 1979, Greenlandic experienced increasing pressure from the Danish language. In the 1950s, Denmark's linguistic policies were directed at strengthening Danish. \nOf primary significance was that post-primary education and official functions were conducted in Danish.<ref name=\"SocEd\" />\n\nFrom 1851 to 1973, Greenlandic was written in a complicated orthography devised by the missionary linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt. In 1973, a new orthography was introduced, intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard, which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt's time. The reform was effective and in the years following it, Greenlandic literacy received a boost.<ref name=\"SocEd\">Goldbach & Winther-Jensen (1988)</ref>\n\nAnother development that strengthened the Greenlandic language has been the policy of \"greenlandization\" of Greenlandic society which began with the homerule agreement of 1979. This policy has worked to reverse the former trend towards marginalization of the Greenlandic language by making it the official language of education. The fact that Greenlandic has become the only language used in primary schooling has meant that today monolingual Danish-speaking parents in Greenland are raising children bilingual in Danish and Greenlandic.<ref>Iutzi-Mitchell & [[Nelson H. H. Graburn]] (1993)</ref> Today Greenlandic has several dedicated news media: the Greenlandic National Radio, [[Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa]], which provides television and radio programming in Greenlandic.  The newspaper [[Sermitsiaq (newspaper)|Sermitsiaq]], has been published since 1958, and in 2010 merged with the other newspaper ''[[Atuagagdliutit/Gr\u00f8nlandsposten]]'', which was established already in 1861 to form a single large Greenlandic language publishing house.<ref>Michael Jones, Kenneth Olwig. 2008.\nNordic Landscapes: Region and Belonging on the Northern Edge of Europe.

The name ''Kalaallisut'' is often used as a cover term for all of Greenlandic. The northern dialect, ''[[Inuktun]] (Avanersuarmiutut),'' spoken in the vicinity of the city of [[Qaanaaq]] (Thule), is particularly closely related to Canadian Inuktitut. The eastern dialect ''([[Tunumiit language|Tunumiit oraasiat]])'', spoken in the vicinity of [[Ammassalik Island]] and [[Ittoqqortoormiit]], is the most innovative of the Greenlandic dialects, having [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilated]] [[consonant cluster]]s and vowel sequences to a greater extent than West Greenlandic.<ref name=\"MahieuTersis\" /> Kalaallisut is further divided into four subdialects. One that is spoken around [[Upernavik]] has certain similarities to East Greenlandic, possibly because of a previous migration from eastern Greenland. A second dialect is spoken in the region of [[Uummannaq]] and the [[Disko Bay]]. The standard language is based on the central Kalaallisut dialect spoken in [[Sisimiut]] in the north, around [[Nuuk]] and as far south as [[Maniitsoq]]. Southern Kalaallisut is spoken around [[Narsaq]] and [[Qaqortoq]] in the south.<ref name=\"encyc\">Rischel, J\u00f8rgen.

Double vowels are analyzed as two [[mora (linguistics)|morae]], so they are phonologically a vowel sequence and not a long vowel; they are also written as two vowels in the orthography.<ref>Rischel (1974) pp. 79 \u2013 80</ref><ref name=\"Jacobsen\">Jacobsen (2000)</ref> The only diphthong in the language is {{IPA|/ai/}}, which occurs only at the ends of words.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) p. 16</ref> Before a [[uvular consonant]] ({{IPA|[q]}} or {{IPA|[\u0281]}}), {{IPA|/i/}} is realized [[allophonic]]ally as {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|[\u025b]}} or {{IPA|[\u0250]}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} is realized [[allophonic]]ally as {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[\u0254]}}, and the two vowels are written ''e, o'' respectively (as in some orthographies used for [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]]).<ref name=\"NTNU\">{{cite book|last1=Hagerup|first1=Asger|title=A Phonological Analysis of Vowel Allophony in West Greenlandic|date=2011|publisher=NTNU}}</ref> {{IPA|/a/}} becomes retracted to {{IPA|[\u0251]}} in the same environment. {{IPA|/i/}} is rounded to {{IPA|[y]}} before labial consonants.<ref name=\"NTNU\" /> {{IPA|/u/}} is fronted to {{IPA|[\u0289]}} between two coronal consonants.<ref name=\"NTNU\" />\n\nThe allophonic lowering of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} before uvular consonants is shown in the modern orthography by writing {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} as {{angle bracket|e}} and {{angle bracket|o}} respectively before uvulars {{angle bracket|q}} and {{angle bracket|r}}. For example:\n\n: {{IPA|/ui/}} \"husband\" pronounced {{IPA|[ui]}}.\n: {{IPA|/uiqarpuq/}} \"(s)he has a husband\" pronounced {{IPA|[ueq\u0251\u0281p\u0254q]}} and written {{angle bracket|ueqarpoq}}.\n\n: {{IPA|/illu/}} \"house\" pronounced {{IPA|[i\u026c\u02d0u]}}.\n: {{IPA|/illuqarpuq/}} \"(s)he has a house\" pronounced {{IPA|[i\u026c\u02d0oq\u0251\u0281p\u0254q]}} and written {{angle bracket|illoqarpoq}}.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nGreenlandic has [[consonant]]s at five points of articulation: [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[palatal]], [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]]. It distinguishes stops, fricatives, and nasals at the labial, alveolar, velar, and uvular points of articulation.<ref group=\"note\">The uvular nasal {{IPA|[\u0274]}} is not found in all dialects and there is dialectal variability regarding its status as a phoneme (Rischel 1974:176\u2013181)</ref> The earlier palatal sibilant {{IPA|[\u0283]}} has merged with {{IPA|[s]}} in all but a few dialects.<ref>Rischel (1974) pp.173\u2013177</ref> The labiodental fricative {{IPA|[f]}} is only contrastive in [[loanword]]s.

Often, Danish loanwords containing {{angle bracket|b d g}} preserve these in writing, although this does not imply a change in pronunciation, for example {{angle bracket|baaja}} {{IPA|[pa\u02d0ja]}} \"beer\" and {{angle bracket|Guuti}} {{IPA|[ku\u02d0t\u02e2i]}} \"God\"; these are pronounced exactly as {{IPA|/p t k/}}.<ref name=\"encyc\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ 2.

Consonant clusters only occur over syllable boundaries and their pronunciation is subject to regressive assimilations that convert them into geminates. All non-nasal consonants in a cluster are voiceless.<ref>Sadock (2003) pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\n=== Prosody ===\nGreenlandic prosody does not include [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] as an autonomous category; instead, [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] is determined by [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] and durational parameters.<ref name=\"Jacobsen\" /> [[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced in a way that may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.<ref name=\"BjornumProsody\">Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) pp. 23\u201326</ref>\n\nGeminate consonants are pronounced long, almost exactly with the double duration of a single consonant.<ref>Sadock (2003) p. 2</ref>\n\nIntonation in indicative clauses usually rises on the antepenultimate syllable, falls on the penult and rises on the last syllable. Interrogative intonation rises on the penultimate and falls on the last syllable.<ref name=\"BjornumProsody\" /><ref>Fortescue (1984) p. 5</ref>\n\n=== Morphophonology ===\nGreenlandic phonology distinguishes itself phonologically from the other Inuit languages by a series of assimilations.\n\nGreenlandic phonology allows clusters, but it does not allow clusters of two different consonants unless the first one is {{IPA|/\u0281/}}. In all other cases the first consonant in a cluster is assimilated to the second one resulting in a geminate consonant. Geminate {{IPA|/tt/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ts]}} and written {{angle bracket|ts}}. Geminate {{IPA|/ll/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[\u026c\u02d0]}}. Geminate {{IPA|/\u0263\u0263/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[\u00e7\u02d0]}} but is written {{angle bracket|gg}}. Geminate {{IPA|/\u0281\u0281/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[\u03c7\u02d0]}}. Geminate {{IPA|/vv/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[f\u02d0]}} and written {{angle bracket|ff}}. {{IPA|/v/}} is also pronounced and written {{IPA|[f]}} after {{IPA|/\u0281/}}.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum,(2003) p. 27</ref>\n\nThese assimilations mean that one of the most recognizable Inuktitut words, ''iglu'' (\"house\"), is ''illu'' in Greenlandic, where the {{IPA|/\u0261l/}} consonant cluster of Inuktitut is assimilated into a [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]]. And the word ''Inuktitut'' itself, when translated into Kalaallisut, becomes ''Inuttut''. The Old Greenlandic diphthong {{IPA|/au/}} has assimilated to {{IPA|/aa/}}.\n\nThe consonant {{IPA|/v/}} has disappeared when between {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/a/}}. This means that affixes beginning with -va or -vi have forms without {{IPA|[v]}} when suffixed to stems ending in {{IPA|/u/}}.\n\nThe vowel {{IPA|/i/}} of modern Greenlandic is the result of a historic merger of the Proto-Eskimo\u2013Aleut vowels *i and *\u026a. The fourth vowel was still present in Old Greenlandic as attested by Hans Egede.<ref>Rischel (1985) pp. 553</ref> In modern West Greenlandic the difference between the two original vowels can only be discerned [[morphophonology|morphophonologically]] in certain environments. The vowel that was originally *\u026a has the variant {{IPA|[a]}} when preceding another vowel and sometimes disappears before certain suffixes.<ref>Underhill (1976)</ref>\n\nThe degree to which the assimilation of consonant clusters has taken place is an important dialectal feature separating Polar Eskimo, [[Inuktun]], which still allows some ungeminated consonant clusters, from West and East Greenlandic. East Greenlandic (''Tunumiit oraasiat'') has shifted some geminate consonants, e.g. {{IPA|[\u026c\u02d0]}} to {{IPA|[t\u02d0]}}. Thus, for example, the East Greenlandic name of a particular town is [[Ittoqqortoormiit]], which would appear as ''Illoqqortoormiut'' in Kalaallisut.<ref name=\"Mennecier\" /><ref name=\"MahieuTersis\">Mahieu & Tersis (2009) p. 53</ref>\n\n== Grammar ==\n[[File:Parkverbot Gr\u00f6nland.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|A bilingual sign in Nuuk, showing the contrast between Danish and Kalaallisut. The sign translates to \"parking forbidden for all vehicles\".]]\nThe [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Greenlandic is highly [[polysynthetic|synthetic]] and exclusively suffixing,<ref>Sadock (2003) p. 12</ref> with the exception of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem.<ref group=\"note\">For example the word ''Nalunaarasuartaatilioqateeraliorfinnialikkersaatiginialikkersaatilillaranatagoorunarsuarooq'' which means something like \"Once again they tried to build a giant radio station, but it was apparently only on the drawing board\"</ref> In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5.<ref>Sadock (2003) pp. 3 & 8</ref><ref group=\"note\">Compare this with the English rate of slightly more than one morpheme per word.</ref> The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four hundred and five hundred derivational ones.<ref>Fortescue & Lennert Olsen (1992) p. 112</ref>\n\nThere are few compound words, but lots of derivations.<ref>Sadock (2003) p. 11</ref> The grammar employs a mixture of [[Head-marking language|head]] and [[Dependent-marking language|dependent marking]]: both [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] and [[Patient (grammar)|patient]] are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent [[noun phrase]]s inflect for case. The primary morphosyntactic alignment of full noun phrases in Kalaallisut is [[Ergative language|ergative-absolutive]], although verbal morphology follows a [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|nominative-accusative]] pattern and pronouns are syntactically neutral.\n\nThe language distinguishes four persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th or 3rd reflexive (see [[#Obviation and switch-reference|Obviation and switch-reference]]), two numbers (singular and plural; no [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] as in Inuktitut), eight moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative, conditional, causative, contemporative and participial) and eight cases (absolutive, ergative, equative, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative and prolative). Verbs carry a bipersonal inflection for subject and object. Possessive noun phrases inflect for their possessor, as well as for case.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) pp. 33\u201334</ref>\n\nIn this section the examples are written in Greenlandic standard orthography except that morpheme boundaries are indicated by a hyphen.\n\n=== Syntax ===\nGreenlandic distinguishes three [[Open class (linguistics)|open word classes]]: [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s and [[Grammatical particle|particles]]. Verbs inflect for person and number of subject and object as well as for mood. Nouns inflect for possession and for case.

Since verbs inflect for number and person of both subject and object, the verb is in fact a clause itself. Therefore, clauses where all participants are expressed as free-standing noun phrases are rather rare.<ref name=\"Bj\u00f8rnum 2003\" /> The following examples show the possibilities of leaving out these verbal arguments:\n\nIntransitive clause with no subject noun phrase:\n: ''Sini-ppoq'' \"(S)he sleeps\"\n: sleep-3p/{{sc|IND}}<ref group=\"note\">In glosses of examples in Greenlandic the abbreviation \"3p\" means \"third person singular\" and has the same meaning as the English third person pronouns ''he'', ''she'' and ''it'', but it does not carry any information about gender.</ref>\n\nIntransitive clause with subject noun phrase:\n: ''Angu-t sinippoq'' \"the man sleeps\"\n: man.{{sc|ABS}} sleep-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n\nTransitive clause with no overt arguments:\n: ''Asa-vaa'' \"(S)he loves him/her/it\"\n: love-3p/3p\n\nTransitive clause with agent noun phrase:\n: ''Angut-ip asa-vaa'' \"the man loves him/her/it\"\n: man-{{sc|ERG}} love-3p/3p\n\nTransitive clause with patient noun phrase:\n: ''Arnaq asa-vaa'' \"(S)he loves the woman\"\n: woman.{{sc|ABS}} love-3p/3p\n\n==== Morphosyntactic alignment ====\nThe Greenlandic language uses [[case (grammar)|case]] to express grammatical relations between participants in a sentence. Nouns are inflected with one of the two core cases or one of the six oblique cases.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) p. 71</ref>\n\nGreenlandic is an [[Ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative]] language. This means that, instead of treating the [[morphosyntax|grammatical relations]] as in most European languages where grammatical [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] are marked with [[nominative case]] and [[object (grammar)|objects]] with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for [[Agent (grammar)|agents]] of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) pp. 71\u201372</ref> Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation has shown that the use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a [[nominative\u2013accusative language]].<ref>Langg\u00e5rd, Karen (2009) \"Grammatical structures in Greenlandic as found in texts written by young Greenlanders at the turn of the millennium\" chapter 15 in Mahieu & Tersis (2009) pp. 231\u2013247{{sic}}</ref>\n\nIntransitive:\n: ''Anda sini-ppoq'' \"Anda sleeps\"\n: Anda.{{sc|ABS}} sleep-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n\nTransitive with agent and object:\n: ''Anda-p nanoq taku-aa'' \"Anda sees a bear\"\n: Anda-{{sc|ERG}} bear.{{sc|ABS}} see-3p/3p\n\n==== Word order ====\nIn transitive clauses where both object and subject are expressed as free noun phrases, basic, pragmatically neutral word order is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|AOXV / SXV]], where X is a noun phrase in one of the oblique cases. This order is fairly free, though. [[Topic (linguistics)|Topical]] noun phrases occur at the beginning of a clause whereas new or emphasized information generally come last. This is usually the verb, but it can also be a [[Focus (linguistics)|focal]] subject or object as well. In spoken language also \"afterthought\" material or clarifications may follow the verb, usually in a lowered pitch.<ref>Fortescue (1993) p. 269</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, the noun phrase is characterized by a rigid order where the head of the phrase precedes any modifiers and the possessor precedes the possessum.<ref>Fortescue (1993) p. 269-270</ref>\n\nIn [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] clauses the order is usually Subject-Copula-Complement.\n\n: ''Andap tujuuluk pisiaraa'' \"Anda bought the sweater\"\n: Anda  sweater  bought\n: A      O         V\n\nAn attribute appears after its head noun.\n\n: ''Andap tujuuluk tungujortoq pisiaraa'' \"Anda bought the blue sweater\"\n: Anda sweater blue bought\n: A      O       X    V\n\nAn attribute of an incorporated noun appears after the verb:\n\n: ''Anda sanasuuvoq pikkorissoq'' \"Anda is a skilled carpenter\"\n: Anda carpenter.IS skilled\n: S     V          APP\n\n==== Coordination and subordination ====\nSyntactic [[Coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] and [[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]] is done by combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative) with predicates in the subordinate moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial). The contemporative has both coordinative and subordinative functions depending on context.<ref>Fortescue(1984) p. 34</ref> The relative order of the main clause and its coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free, and mostly subject to [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] concerns.<ref>Fortescue (1993) p. 270</ref>\n\n==== Obviation and switch-reference ====\nThe Greenlandic pronominal system includes a distinction known as [[obviative|obviation]]<ref>Bittner (1995) p. 80</ref> or [[switch-reference]].<ref>Fortescue 1991. 53 ff.</ref> There is a special so-called fourth person<ref>Woodbury (1983)</ref> used to denote a third person subject of a subordinate verb or the possessor of a noun that is coreferent with the third person subject of the matrix clause.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) pp. 152\u2013154</ref> Below are examples of the difference between third and fourth person:\n\n: ''illu-a taku-aa'' \"he saw his (the other man's) house\"\n: house-3{{sc|POSS}} see-3p/3p\n\n: ''illu-ni taku-aa'' \"he saw his own house\"\n: house-4{{sc|POSS}} see-3p/3p\n\n: ''Ole oqar-poq tillu-kkiga'' \"Ole said I had hit him (the other man)\"\n: Ole say-3p hit-I/3p\n\n: ''Ole oqar-poq tillu-kkini'' \"Ole said I had hit him (Ole)\"\n: Ole say-3p hit-I/4p<ref group=\"note\">The abbreviation \"4p\" refers to the fourth or reflexive person.</ref>\n\n: ''Eva iser-uni sini-ssaa-q'' \"When Eva comes in she'll sleep\"\n: Eva come.in-4p sleep-expect-3p\n\n: ''Eva iser-pat sini-ssaa-q'' When Eva comes in (s)he'll sleep (someone else).\n: Eva come.in-3p sleep-expect-3p\n\n==== Indefiniteness construction ====\nThere is no category of [[definiteness]] in Greenlandic, so the information whether participants are already known to the listener or new in the discourse is encoded by other means. According to some authors,  morphology related to transitivity such as the use of the construction sometimes called [[Antipassive voice|antipassive]]<ref>Kappel Schmidt (2003)</ref><ref name=\"Sadock 2003\">Sadock (2003)</ref> or intransitive object<ref>Fortescue (1984) p. 92 & p. 249</ref> conveys such meaning, along with strategies of noun incorporation of non-topical noun phrases.<ref>Hallman, Peter (n.d.) \"Definiteness in Inuktitut\"[http://hallklar.bol.ucla.edu/Inuktitut.pdf]{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} p. 2</ref><ref>van Geenhoven (1998)</ref> This view, however, is controversial.<ref name=\"Bittner 1987\">Bittner (1987)</ref>\n\nActive:\n: ''Piitap arfeq takuaa'' \"Peter saw the whale\"\n: Peter-{{sc|ERG}} whale see\n\nAntipassive/intransitive object:\n: ''Piitaq arfermik takuvoq'' \"Peter saw (a) whale\"\n: Peter-{{sc|ABS}} whale-{{sc|INSTR}} see\n\n=== Verbs ===\nThe morphology of Greenlandic verbs is enormously complex. The two main processes are [[inflection]] and [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]. Inflectional morphology includes the processes of obligatory inflection for mood, person, and [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] (tense/[[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] is not an inflectional category in Kalaallisut).<ref name=\"Shaer\">Shaer (2003)</ref><ref name=\"Bittner2005\">Bittner (2005)</ref><ref name=\"HayashiSprenger\">Hayashi& Spreng (2005)</ref> Derivational morphology modifies the meaning of verbs in a way similar to that expressed by [[adverb]]s in English. Derivational suffixes of this kind number in the hundreds. Many of these suffixes are so semantically salient that they are often referred to as [[postbase]]s rather than suffixes, particularly in the American tradition of Eskimo grammar.<ref>Fortescue (1980) note 1</ref> Such semantically \"heavy\" suffixes may express concepts such as \"to have\", \"to be\", \"to say\", or \"to think\". The Greenlandic verb word consists of a root + derivational suffixes/postbases + inflectional suffixes. Tense and aspect is marked by optional suffixes that appear between the derivational and inflectional suffixes.\n\n==== Inflection ====\nGreenlandic verbs inflect for [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four are used in independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: [[indicative]], [[Interrogative mood|interrogative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[optative]]. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or [[Negation (linguistics)|negative]] inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) p. 35-50</ref> The inflectional system is further complicated by the fact that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.<ref>Fortescue & Lennert Olsen (1992) pp. 112 and 119\u2013122)</ref>\n\n===== Indicative and interrogative moods =====\n\nThe indicative mood is used in all independent expository clauses. The interrogative mood is used for posing [[Question#Grammar|questions]]. Questions with the question particle ''immaqa'' \"maybe\" cannot use the interrogative mood.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) p. 39</ref>\n\n: ''napparsima-vit''? \"Are you sick?\" (interrogative mood)\n: be.sick-YOU/{{sc|INTERR}}\n\n: ''naamik, napparsima-nngila-nga''. \"No, I am not sick\" (indicative mood)\n: no, be.sick-{{sc|NEG}}-I/{{sc|IND}}\n\nTable 5 shows the intransitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb ''neri-'' \"to eat\" in the indicative and interrogative moods (question marks mark interrogative intonation\u2014questions have falling intonation on the last syllable as opposed to most [[Indo-European languages]] in which questions are marked by rising intonation). The indicative and the interrogative mood each have a transitive and an intransitive inflection, but here only the intransitive inflection is given. [[Consonant gradation]] like that in Finnish appears to show up in the verb conjugation (with strengthening to ''pp'' in the 3rd person plural and weakening to ''v'' elsewhere).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 5.

It is always combined with the second person. The optative is used to express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative have transitive and intransitive paradigms. There are two transitive positive imperative paradigms: a standard one, and one that is considered rude and is usually used to address children.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) p. 40-42</ref>\n\n: ''sini-git''! \"Sleep!\"\n: sleep-{{sc|IMP}}\n\n: ''sini-llanga'' \"Let me sleep!\"\n: sleep-1p.{{sc|OPT}}\n\n: ''sini-nnak''! \"Don't sleep!\"\n: sleep-{{sc|NEG}}.{{sc|IMP}}\n\n===== Conditional mood =====\nThe conditional mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning \"if\" or \"when\".<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) p. 45</ref>\n\n: ''seqinner-pat Eva ani-ssaa-q'' \"If the sun shines, Eva will go out\"\n: Sunshine-{{sc|COND}} Eva go.out-expect/3p\n\n===== Causative mood =====\nThe causative mood (sometimes called the ''conjunctive'') is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning \"because\", \"since\" or \"when\"; it is also sometimes used with the meaning of \"that\". The causative is also used in main clauses to imply some underlying cause.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum(2003) pp. 43\u201344</ref>\n\n: ''qasu-gami innar-poq'' \"He went to bed because he was tired\"\n: be.tired-{{sc|CAU}}/3p go.to.bed-3p\n\n: ''matta-ttor-ama'' \"I've eaten blubber (that's why I'm not hungry)\"\n: blubber-eat-{{sc|CAU}}/I\n\n: ''ani-guit eqqaama-ssa-vat teriannia-qar-mat'' \"If you go out, remember that there are foxes\"\n: go.out-{{sc|COND}}/{{sc|YOU}} remember-fut-{{sc|IMP}} fox-are-{{sc|CAUS}}\n\n===== Contemporative mood =====\nThe contemporative mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if the subject of the subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative can also be used to form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum(2003) pp.46\u201349</ref>\n\n: ''qasu-llunga angerlar-punga'' \"Being tired, I went home\"\n: be.tired-{{sc|CONT}}.{{sc|I}} go.home-I\n\n: ''98-inik ukio-qar-luni toqu-voq'' \"Being 98 years old, he/she died\", \"he/she was 98 when he/she died\"\n: 98-{{sc|INSTR}}.{{sc|PL}} year-have-{{sc|CONT}}.4p.{{sc|SG}} die-3p\n\n: ''Eva oqar-poq kami-it akiler-lugit'' \"Eva said she had paid for the boots\"\n: Eva say-3p boot-{{sc|PL}} pay-{{sc|CONT}}.3p.{{sc|PL}}\n\n===== Participial mood =====\nThe participial mood is used to construct a subordinate clause describing its subject in the state of carrying out an activity. It is used when the matrix clause and the subordinate clause have different subjects. It is often used in appositional phrases such as [[relative clauses]].<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\n: ''atuar-toq taku-ara'' \"I saw her read/{{sc|I}} saw that she read\"\n: read-{{sc|PART}}/3p see-I/3p\n\n: ''neriu-ppunga tiki-ssa-soq'' \"I hope he is coming/{{sc|I}} hope he'll come\"\n: hope-{{sc|I}} come-expect-{{sc|PART}}/3p\n\n==== Derivation ====\nVerbal derivation is extremely productive, and Greenlandic employs many hundreds of derivational suffixes. Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix, resulting in very long words. Below are given some examples of how derivational suffixes can change the meaning of verbs.\n\n-''katap''- \"be tired of\"\n: ''taku-katap-para'' \"I am tired of seeing it/him/her\"\n: see-tired.of-I/3p\n\n-''ler''- \"begin to/be about to\"\n: ''neri-ler-pugut'' \"We are about to eat\"\n: eat-begin-WE\n\n-''llaqqip''- \"be proficient at\"\n: ''erinar-su-llaqqip-poq'' \"She is good at singing\"\n: sing-{{sc|HAB}}-proficiently-3p\n\n-''niar''- \"plans to/wants to\"\n: ''aallar-niar-poq'' \"He plans to travel\"\n: travel-plan-3p\n\n: ''angerlar-niar-aluar-punga'' \"I was planning to go home though\"\n: go.home-plan-though-I\n\n-''ngajap''- \"almost\"\n: ''sini-ngajap-punga'' \"I had almost fallen asleep\"\n: sleep-almost-I\n\n-''nikuu-nngila''- \"has never\"\n: ''taku-nikuu-nngila-ra'' \"I have never seen it\"\n: see-never-{{sc|NEG}}-I/3p\n\n-''nngitsoor''- \"not anyway/afterall\"\n: ''tiki-nngitsoor-poq'' \"He hasn't arrived after all\"\n: arrive-not.afterall-3p\n\n==== Time reference and aspect ====\nGreenlandic grammar has morphological devices to mark a distinction between, for example, recent and distant past, but the use of these is not obligatory,<ref>Fortescue (1984:) p. 273</ref> and they should therefore rather be understood as parts of Greenlandic's extensive derivational system than as a system of [[Tense (grammar)|tense]] markers. Rather than by morphological marking, fixed temporal distance is expressed by temporal adverbials:<ref>Trondhjem (2009) pp. 173\u2013175</ref>\n\n: ''toqo-riikatap-poq'' \"He died long ago\"<ref name=\"Fortescue 1984 p. 273\">Fortescue (1984) p. 273</ref>\n: die-long.ago-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n: ''nere-qqammer-punga'' \"I ate recently\"<ref name=\"Fortescue 1984 p. 273\" />\n: eat-recently-I/{{sc|IND}}\n: ''ippassaq Piitaq arpap-poq'' \"Yesterday Peter was running.\"<ref name=\"Trondhjem 2009 p. 174\">Trondhjem (2009) p. 174</ref>\n: yesterday Peter-{{sc|ABS}} run-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n\nAll other things being equal and in the absence of any explicit adverbials, the indicative mood will be interpreted as complete or incomplete depending on the verbal [[Lexical aspect|aktionsart]].<ref name=\"Trondhjem 2009 p. 174\" />\n\n: ''Piitaq arpap-poq'' \"Peter runs\"<ref name=\"Trondhjem 2009 p. 174\" />\n: Peter-{{sc|ABS}} run-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n: ''Piitaq ani-voq'' \"Peter was gone out\"<ref name=\"Trondhjem 2009 p. 174\" />\n: Peter-{{sc|ABS}} go.out-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n\nBut if a sentence containing an atelic verbal phrase is embedded within the context of a past time narrative, it would be interpreted as past.<ref>Bittner (2005) p. 7</ref>\n\nGreenlandic has several purely derivational devices of expressing meaning related to aspect and aktionsart, e.g. ''sar'' expressing \"habituality\" and ''ssaar'' expressing \"stop to\".<ref>Fortescue (1984) pp. 276\u2013287. The dividing line between aktionsart, aspect and still other functions not fitting into these categories would yet have to be clarified.</ref> Next to these, there are at least two major perfect markers: ''sima'' and ''nikuu''. ''sima'' can occur in several positions with obviously different function<ref>Fortescue (1984) pp. 272\u2013273</ref> Rightmost position indicates evidential meaning, but this can be determined only if a number of suffixes are present.\n\n: ''tiki(t)-nikuu-sima-voq'' \"Apparently, she had arrived\"<ref>Trondhjem (2009) p. 177</ref>\n: arrive-NIKUU-SIMA-3p/{{sc|INT}}\n\nWith [[telicity|atelic verbs]], there is a regular contrast between indirective [[evidentiality]] marked by ''sima'' and witnessed evidentiality marked by ''nikuu''.<ref name=\"Trondhjem 2009 p. 179\">Trondhjem (2009) p. 179</ref> Due to its evidential meaning, the combination of first person and ''sima'' sometimes is marked.<ref>cp. Trondhjem (2009) p. 180</ref>\n\n: ''qia-sima-voq'' \"He cried (his eyes are swollen)\"\n: cry-SIMA-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n: ''qia-nikuu-voq'' \"He cried (I was there)\"\n: cry-NIKUU-3p/{{sc|IND}}<ref name=\"Trondhjem 2009 p. 179\" />\n\nIn the written language<ref name=\"Fortescue 1984 p. 273\" /> and more recently also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers, ''sima'' and ''nikuu'' can be used together with adverbials referring to a particular time in the past.<ref>Trondhjem (2009) pp. 179\u2013180</ref> That is, they might arguably mark time reference, but not yet systematically.\n\nJust as Greenlandic does not systematically mark past tense, the language also does not have a future tense. Rather, it employs three different strategies to express future meaning:\n* suffixes denoting cognitive states that show an attitude about prospective actions.\n: e.g. ''Ilimaga-ara aasaq manna Dudley qujanar-tor-si-ffigi-ssa-llugu'' \"I expect to get some fun out of Dudley this summer.\"\n:: expect-I/3p/{{sc|IND}} summer this Dudley be.fun-cn-get.from-expect-CONTEMPORATIVE/3p\n* inchoative suffixes creating telic actions which can then be understood as already having begun by virtue of the indicative mood.\n: e.g. ''Aggiuti-ler-para'' \"I've started to bring him.\"\n:: bring-begin-I/3p/{{sc|IND}}\n* moods that mark the speech act as a request or wish.<ref>cp. Bittner (2005) p. 36</ref>\n: e.g. ''Qimmi-t nirukkar-niar-nigik'' \"Let us feed the dogs, ok?\"<ref>Bittner (2005) pp. 12\u201313; translation of 15 altered. Glosses standardised to the system used in this article.</ref>\n:: dog-{{sc|PL}} feed-please-we/them/{{sc|IMP}}\n\nWhile the status of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, some scholars have claimed that Greenlandic has a basic temporal distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix ''-ssa'' and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers.<ref>Fortescue (1984)</ref><ref>Trondhjem (2009)</ref> However, at least for literary Greenlandic, these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics that can be used to refer to the future via the strategies just described.<ref>Bittner (2005) pp. 11, 38\u201343</ref>\n\n==== Noun incorporation ====\nThere is also a debate in the linguistic literature whether Greenlandic has [[noun incorporation]]. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root can be incorporated into almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of [[morpheme]]s that require a noun root as their host and which form [[complex predicate]]s that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses.<ref name=\"Sadock 2003\" /><ref>Sadock (1980)</ref><ref>Sadock(1986)</ref><ref>Sadock (1999)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bulba.sdsu.edu/~malouf/papers/greenlandic.pdf|title=Malouf (1999)|website=sdsu.edu|accessdate=20 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030712004225/http://bulba.sdsu.edu/~malouf/papers/greenlandic.pdf|archive-date=2003-07-12|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>van Geenhoven (2002)</ref> This argument is supported by the fact that many of the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized.<ref>Marianne Mithun \"Polysynthesis in the Arctic\" in Mahieu and Tersis (2009).</ref> Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element.<ref>Mithun (1986)</ref><ref>Mithun (1984)</ref><ref>Rosen (1989)</ref> The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.\n\n''qimmeq'' \"dog\" + ''-qar- \"have\" (+ ''-poq'' \"3p\")\n: ''qimme-qar-poq'' \"She has a dog\"\n\n''illu'' \"house\" + -'lior''- \"make\"\n: ''illu-lior-poq'' \"She builds a house\"\n\n''kaffi'' \"coffee\" + -''sor''- \"drink/eat\"\n: kaffi-sor-poq \"She drinks coffee\"\n\n''puisi'' \"seal\" + -''nniar''- \"hunt\"\n: puisi-nniar-poq \"She hunts seal\"\n\n''allagaq'' \"letter\" + -''si''- \"receive\"\n: allagar-si-voq \"She has received a letter\"\n\n''anaana'' \"mother\" + -''a''- \"to be\"\n: anaana-a-voq \"She is a mother\"\n\n=== Nouns ===\nNouns are obligatorily inflected for case and number and optionally for number and person of possessor. Singular and plural are distinguished and 8 cases used: absolutive, ergative (relative), instrumental, allative, locative, ablative, prosecutive (also called vialis or prolative), and equative.<ref>Fortescue (1984) p. 71</ref> Case and number are marked by a single suffix. Nouns can be derived from verbs or from other nouns by a number of suffixes, e.g. ''atuar''- \"to read\" + -''fik'' \"place\" becomes ''atuarfik'' \"school\" and ''atuarfik'' + -''tsialak'' \"something good\" becomes ''atuarfitsialak'' \"good school\".\n\nThe fact that the possessive agreement suffixes on nouns and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs in a number of instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that Greenlandic has a distinction between transitive and intransitive nouns, parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.<ref>Sadock (2003) p. 5</ref><ref group=\"note\">For example the suffix with the shape -aa means \"his/hers/its\" when suffixed to a noun, but \"him/her/it\" when suffixed to a verb, likewise the suffix -ra either means \"my\" or \"me\" depending on whether it is suffixed on a verb or a noun.</ref>\n\n==== Pronouns ====\nThere are personal pronouns for first-, second-, and third-person singular and plural. These pronouns are optional as subjects or objects, but only when the verbal inflection refers to such arguments.<ref>Fortescue (1984) p. 252</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 200px; height: 200px;\"\n|+ Personal pronouns\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Singular\n! scope=\"col\" | Plural\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First person\n| uanga || uagut\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Second person\n| illit || ilissi\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Third person\n| una || uku\n|}\n\nPersonal pronouns are, however, necessary in the oblique case:\n\n: ilin-nut  niri-qu-aa\n: thou all. eat tell-to 3s-3s-indic.\n: 'He told you to eat it'\n\n==== Case ====\nThe two grammatical core cases ergative and absolutive are used to express grammatical and syntactical roles of participant noun phrases.

Early loans from Danish have often become acculturated to the Greenlandic phonological system, for example the Greenlandic word ''palasi'' \"priest\" is a loan from the Danish \"pr\u00e6st\". But since Greenlandic has an enormous potential for the derivation of new words from existing roots, many modern concepts have Greenlandic names that have been invented rather than borrowed, e.g. ''qarasaasiaq'' \"computer\" which literally means \"artificial brain\". This potential for complex derivations also means that Greenlandic vocabulary is built on very few roots which combined with affixes come to form large word families.<ref name=\"encyc\" /> For example the root for \"tongue\" ''oqaq'' is used to derive the following words:\n\n* ''oqarpoq''          'says'\n* ''oqaaseq''          'word'\n* ''oqaluppoq''          'speaks'\n* ''oqaasilerisoq ''  'linguist'\n* ''oqaasilerissutit''  'grammar'\n* ''oqaluttualiortoq''  'author'\n* ''oqaasipiluuppaa''  'harangues him'\n* ''oqaloqatigiinneq''   'conversation'\n* ''oqaatiginerluppaa''  'speaks badly about him'\n\nLexical differences between dialects are often considerable. This is due to the earlier cultural practice of imposing [[taboo]] on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.<ref name=\"encyc\" />\n\n== Orthography ==\n[[File:\u0138ra in a dictionary (ubt).JPG|thumb|'''[[Kra (letter)|\u0138]]''' in a Greenlandic\u2013Danish dictionary from 1926]]Greenlandic is written with the [[Latin script]].  The alphabet:\n: A E F G I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V\nTo spell loanwords from other languages, especially from Danish and English, the additional letters ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''H'', ''W'', ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'', ''\u00c6'', ''\u00d8'' and ''\u00c5'' are used.<ref>Gr\u00f8nlands sprogn\u00e6vn (1992)</ref><ref>Petersen (1990)</ref> Greenlandic uses the symbols \"...\" and \u00bb...\u00ab as [[non-English usage of quotation marks|quotation marks]].\n\nFrom 1851 until 1973, Greenlandic was written in the alphabet invented by [[Samuel Kleinschmidt]]. This alphabet employed the special character ''[[Kra (letter)|kra]]'' ('''\u039a\u02bc / \u0138''') which was replaced by [[q]] in the 1973 reform.<ref>http://www.evertype.com/alphabets/greenlandic.pdf</ref> In the Kleinschmidt alphabet, long vowels and geminate consonants were indicated by means of diacritics on the vowels (in the case of consonant gemination, the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant). For example, the name ''Kalaallit Nunaat'' was spelled ''Kal\u00e2dlit Nun\u00e2t''. This scheme uses a [[circumflex accent]] ( \u02c6 ) to indicate a long vowel (''e.g.'', ''\u00e2t/\u00eet/\u00fbt'', modern: ''aat'', ''iit'', ''uut''), an [[acute accent]] ( \u00b4 ) to indicate gemination of the following consonant: (''i.e.'', ''\u00e1'', ''\u00ed'', ''\u00fa'' modern: ''a(kk)'', ''i(kk)'', ''u(kk)'')] and, finally, a [[tilde]] ( \u02dc ) or a [[grave accent]] ( ` ), depending on the author, indicates vowel length ''and'' gemination of the following consonant (''e.g.'', ''\u00e3t'', ''\u0129t'', ''\u0169t'' or ''\u00e0t'', ''\u00ect'', ''\u00f9t'', modern: ''aatt'', ''iitt'', ''uutt''). The letters ''\u00ea'' and ''\u00f4'', used only before ''r'' and ''q'', are now written ''ee'' and ''oo'' in Greenlandic. The spelling system of [[Nunatsiavummiutut]], spoken in [[Nunatsiavut]] in northeastern [[Labrador]], is derived from the old Greenlandic system.\n\nTechnically, the Kleinschmidt orthography focused upon morphology: the same derivational affix would be written in the same way in different contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://giellatekno.uit.no/cgi/d-kal.eng.html|title=Programs for analysing Greenlandic|author=|date=|website=giellatekno.uit.no|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref> whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.\n\n=== Sample text ===\n{{lang|kl|Inuit tamarmik inunngorput nammineersinnaassuseqarlutik assigiimmillu ataqqinassuseqarlutillu pisinnaatitaaffeqarlutik.

It is closely related to the [[Inuit languages]] in [[Canada]], such as [[Inuktitut]]. The main variety, [[Kalaallisut]], or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009; this is a move by the [[Naalakkersuisut]] (government of Greenland) to strengthen the language in its competition with the colonial language, [[Danish language|Danish]]. The second variety is [[Tunumiit language|Tunumiit oraasiat]], or East Greenlandic.  The Thule Inuit of Greenland, [[Inuktun]] or Polar Eskimo, is a recent arrival and a dialect of [[Inuktitut]].\n\nGreenlandic is a [[polysynthetic language]] that allows the creation of long words by stringing together [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] and [[suffix]]es. Its [[morphosyntactic alignment]] is [[Ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative]], meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument (\"subject\") of an intransitive verb like the object of a transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent (\"subject\") of a transitive verb. {{Example needed |date=August 2019}}\n\nNouns are inflected for one of the eight cases and for possession. Verbs are inflected for one of the eight [[Grammatical mood|moods]] and for the [[Grammatical number|number]] and [[Grammatical person|person]] of its [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|object]]. Both nouns and verbs have complex derivational morphology. Basic word order in [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitive]] [[clause]]s is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]. Subordination of clauses is done by the use of special subordinate moods. A so-called fourth-person category enables [[switch-reference]] between main clauses and subordinate clauses with different subjects. Greenlandic is notable for its lack of a system of [[grammatical tense]], as temporal relations are normally expressed through context, through the use of temporal particles such as \"yesterday\" or \"now\" or sometimes through the use of derivational suffixes or the combination of affixes with [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] meanings with the semantic [[lexical aspect|aktionsart]] of different verbs. However, some linguists have suggested that Greenlandic does mark future tense obligatorily. Another question is whether the language has [[Incorporation (linguistics)|noun incorporation]], or whether the processes that create complex predicates that include nominal roots are derivational in nature.\n\nWhen adopting new concepts or technologies, Greenlandic usually constructs new words made from Greenlandic roots, but modern Greenlandic has also taken many loans from Danish and [[English language|English]]. The language has been written in the Latin script since Danish colonization began in the 1700s. The first orthography was developed by [[Samuel Kleinschmidt]] in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because of a number of sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy, which is now among the highest in the world.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Inuktitut dialect map.svg|upright=1.6|right|thumb|Illustration 1: Distribution of Inuit language variants across the Arctic.]]\nThe Greenlandic language was brought to Greenland with the arrival of the [[Thule people]] in the 1200s. It is unknown which languages were spoken by the earlier [[Saqqaq culture|Saqqaq]] and [[Dorset culture]]s in Greenland.\n\nThe first descriptions of Greenlandic date from the 1600s, and with the arrival of Danish missionaries in the early 1700s, and the beginning of Danish colonialism in Greenland, the compilation of dictionaries and description of grammar began. The missionary [[Paul Egede]] wrote the first Greenlandic dictionary in 1750, and the first grammar in 1760.<ref name=\"encyc\" />\n\nFrom the Danish colonization in the 1700s to the beginning of Greenlandic home rule in 1979, Greenlandic experienced increasing pressure from the Danish language. In the 1950s, Denmark's linguistic policies were directed at strengthening Danish. \nOf primary significance was that post-primary education and official functions were conducted in Danish.<ref name=\"SocEd\" />\n\nFrom 1851 to 1973, Greenlandic was written in a complicated orthography devised by the missionary linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt. In 1973, a new orthography was introduced, intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard, which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt's time. The reform was effective and in the years following it, Greenlandic literacy received a boost.<ref name=\"SocEd\">Goldbach & Winther-Jensen (1988)</ref>\n\nAnother development that strengthened the Greenlandic language has been the policy of \"greenlandization\" of Greenlandic society which began with the homerule agreement of 1979. This policy has worked to reverse the former trend towards marginalization of the Greenlandic language by making it the official language of education. The fact that Greenlandic has become the only language used in primary schooling has meant that today monolingual Danish-speaking parents in Greenland are raising children bilingual in Danish and Greenlandic.<ref>Iutzi-Mitchell & [[Nelson H. H. Graburn]] (1993)</ref> Today Greenlandic has several dedicated news media: the Greenlandic National Radio, [[Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa]], which provides television and radio programming in Greenlandic.  The newspaper [[Sermitsiaq (newspaper)|Sermitsiaq]], has been published since 1958, and in 2010 merged with the other newspaper ''[[Atuagagdliutit/Gr\u00f8nlandsposten]]'', which was established already in 1861 to form a single large Greenlandic language publishing house.<ref>Michael Jones, Kenneth Olwig. 2008.\nNordic Landscapes: Region and Belonging on the Northern Edge of Europe.

The name ''Kalaallisut'' is often used as a cover term for all of Greenlandic. The northern dialect, ''[[Inuktun]] (Avanersuarmiutut),'' spoken in the vicinity of the city of [[Qaanaaq]] (Thule), is particularly closely related to Canadian Inuktitut. The eastern dialect ''([[Tunumiit language|Tunumiit oraasiat]])'', spoken in the vicinity of [[Ammassalik Island]] and [[Ittoqqortoormiit]], is the most innovative of the Greenlandic dialects, having [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilated]] [[consonant cluster]]s and vowel sequences to a greater extent than West Greenlandic.<ref name=\"MahieuTersis\" /> Kalaallisut is further divided into four subdialects. One that is spoken around [[Upernavik]] has certain similarities to East Greenlandic, possibly because of a previous migration from eastern Greenland. A second dialect is spoken in the region of [[Uummannaq]] and the [[Disko Bay]]. The standard language is based on the central Kalaallisut dialect spoken in [[Sisimiut]] in the north, around [[Nuuk]] and as far south as [[Maniitsoq]]. Southern Kalaallisut is spoken around [[Narsaq]] and [[Qaqortoq]] in the south.<ref name=\"encyc\">Rischel, J\u00f8rgen.

Double vowels are analyzed as two [[mora (linguistics)|morae]], so they are phonologically a vowel sequence and not a long vowel; they are also written as two vowels in the orthography.<ref>Rischel (1974) pp. 79 \u2013 80</ref><ref name=\"Jacobsen\">Jacobsen (2000)</ref> The only diphthong in the language is {{IPA|/ai/}}, which occurs only at the ends of words.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) p. 16</ref> Before a [[uvular consonant]] ({{IPA|[q]}} or {{IPA|[\u0281]}}), {{IPA|/i/}} is realized [[allophonic]]ally as {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|[\u025b]}} or {{IPA|[\u0250]}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} is realized [[allophonic]]ally as {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[\u0254]}}, and the two vowels are written ''e, o'' respectively (as in some orthographies used for [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]]).<ref name=\"NTNU\">{{cite book|last1=Hagerup|first1=Asger|title=A Phonological Analysis of Vowel Allophony in West Greenlandic|date=2011|publisher=NTNU}}</ref> {{IPA|/a/}} becomes retracted to {{IPA|[\u0251]}} in the same environment. {{IPA|/i/}} is rounded to {{IPA|[y]}} before labial consonants.<ref name=\"NTNU\" /> {{IPA|/u/}} is fronted to {{IPA|[\u0289]}} between two coronal consonants.<ref name=\"NTNU\" />\n\nThe allophonic lowering of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} before uvular consonants is shown in the modern orthography by writing {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} as {{angle bracket|e}} and {{angle bracket|o}} respectively before uvulars {{angle bracket|q}} and {{angle bracket|r}}. For example:\n\n: {{IPA|/ui/}} \"husband\" pronounced {{IPA|[ui]}}.\n: {{IPA|/uiqarpuq/}} \"(s)he has a husband\" pronounced {{IPA|[ueq\u0251\u0281p\u0254q]}} and written {{angle bracket|ueqarpoq}}.\n\n: {{IPA|/illu/}} \"house\" pronounced {{IPA|[i\u026c\u02d0u]}}.\n: {{IPA|/illuqarpuq/}} \"(s)he has a house\" pronounced {{IPA|[i\u026c\u02d0oq\u0251\u0281p\u0254q]}} and written {{angle bracket|illoqarpoq}}.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nGreenlandic has [[consonant]]s at five points of articulation: [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[palatal]], [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]]. It distinguishes stops, fricatives, and nasals at the labial, alveolar, velar, and uvular points of articulation.<ref group=\"note\">The uvular nasal {{IPA|[\u0274]}} is not found in all dialects and there is dialectal variability regarding its status as a phoneme (Rischel 1974:176\u2013181)</ref> The earlier palatal sibilant {{IPA|[\u0283]}} has merged with {{IPA|[s]}} in all but a few dialects.<ref>Rischel (1974) pp.173\u2013177</ref> The labiodental fricative {{IPA|[f]}} is only contrastive in [[loanword]]s.

Often, Danish loanwords containing {{angle bracket|b d g}} preserve these in writing, although this does not imply a change in pronunciation, for example {{angle bracket|baaja}} {{IPA|[pa\u02d0ja]}} \"beer\" and {{angle bracket|Guuti}} {{IPA|[ku\u02d0t\u02e2i]}} \"God\"; these are pronounced exactly as {{IPA|/p t k/}}.<ref name=\"encyc\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ 2.

Consonant clusters only occur over syllable boundaries and their pronunciation is subject to regressive assimilations that convert them into geminates. All non-nasal consonants in a cluster are voiceless.<ref>Sadock (2003) pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\n=== Prosody ===\nGreenlandic prosody does not include [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] as an autonomous category; instead, [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] is determined by [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] and durational parameters.<ref name=\"Jacobsen\" /> [[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced in a way that may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.<ref name=\"BjornumProsody\">Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) pp. 23\u201326</ref>\n\nGeminate consonants are pronounced long, almost exactly with the double duration of a single consonant.<ref>Sadock (2003) p. 2</ref>\n\nIntonation in indicative clauses usually rises on the antepenultimate syllable, falls on the penult and rises on the last syllable. Interrogative intonation rises on the penultimate and falls on the last syllable.<ref name=\"BjornumProsody\" /><ref>Fortescue (1984) p. 5</ref>\n\n=== Morphophonology ===\nGreenlandic phonology distinguishes itself phonologically from the other Inuit languages by a series of assimilations.\n\nGreenlandic phonology allows clusters, but it does not allow clusters of two different consonants unless the first one is {{IPA|/\u0281/}}. In all other cases the first consonant in a cluster is assimilated to the second one resulting in a geminate consonant. Geminate {{IPA|/tt/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ts]}} and written {{angle bracket|ts}}. Geminate {{IPA|/ll/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[\u026c\u02d0]}}. Geminate {{IPA|/\u0263\u0263/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[\u00e7\u02d0]}} but is written {{angle bracket|gg}}. Geminate {{IPA|/\u0281\u0281/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[\u03c7\u02d0]}}. Geminate {{IPA|/vv/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[f\u02d0]}} and written {{angle bracket|ff}}. {{IPA|/v/}} is also pronounced and written {{IPA|[f]}} after {{IPA|/\u0281/}}.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum,(2003) p. 27</ref>\n\nThese assimilations mean that one of the most recognizable Inuktitut words, ''iglu'' (\"house\"), is ''illu'' in Greenlandic, where the {{IPA|/\u0261l/}} consonant cluster of Inuktitut is assimilated into a [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]]. And the word ''Inuktitut'' itself, when translated into Kalaallisut, becomes ''Inuttut''. The Old Greenlandic diphthong {{IPA|/au/}} has assimilated to {{IPA|/aa/}}.\n\nThe consonant {{IPA|/v/}} has disappeared when between {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/a/}}. This means that affixes beginning with -va or -vi have forms without {{IPA|[v]}} when suffixed to stems ending in {{IPA|/u/}}.\n\nThe vowel {{IPA|/i/}} of modern Greenlandic is the result of a historic merger of the Proto-Eskimo\u2013Aleut vowels *i and *\u026a. The fourth vowel was still present in Old Greenlandic as attested by Hans Egede.<ref>Rischel (1985) pp. 553</ref> In modern West Greenlandic the difference between the two original vowels can only be discerned [[morphophonology|morphophonologically]] in certain environments. The vowel that was originally *\u026a has the variant {{IPA|[a]}} when preceding another vowel and sometimes disappears before certain suffixes.<ref>Underhill (1976)</ref>\n\nThe degree to which the assimilation of consonant clusters has taken place is an important dialectal feature separating Polar Eskimo, [[Inuktun]], which still allows some ungeminated consonant clusters, from West and East Greenlandic. East Greenlandic (''Tunumiit oraasiat'') has shifted some geminate consonants, e.g. {{IPA|[\u026c\u02d0]}} to {{IPA|[t\u02d0]}}. Thus, for example, the East Greenlandic name of a particular town is [[Ittoqqortoormiit]], which would appear as ''Illoqqortoormiut'' in Kalaallisut.<ref name=\"Mennecier\" /><ref name=\"MahieuTersis\">Mahieu & Tersis (2009) p. 53</ref>\n\n== Grammar ==\n[[File:Parkverbot Gr\u00f6nland.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|A bilingual sign in Nuuk, showing the contrast between Danish and Kalaallisut. The sign translates to \"parking forbidden for all vehicles\".]]\nThe [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Greenlandic is highly [[polysynthetic|synthetic]] and exclusively suffixing,<ref>Sadock (2003) p. 12</ref> with the exception of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem.<ref group=\"note\">For example the word ''Nalunaarasuartaatilioqateeraliorfinnialikkersaatiginialikkersaatilillaranatagoorunarsuarooq'' which means something like \"Once again they tried to build a giant radio station, but it was apparently only on the drawing board\"</ref> In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5.<ref>Sadock (2003) pp. 3 & 8</ref><ref group=\"note\">Compare this with the English rate of slightly more than one morpheme per word.</ref> The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four hundred and five hundred derivational ones.<ref>Fortescue & Lennert Olsen (1992) p. 112</ref>\n\nThere are few compound words, but lots of derivations.<ref>Sadock (2003) p. 11</ref> The grammar employs a mixture of [[Head-marking language|head]] and [[Dependent-marking language|dependent marking]]: both [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] and [[Patient (grammar)|patient]] are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent [[noun phrase]]s inflect for case. The primary morphosyntactic alignment of full noun phrases in Kalaallisut is [[Ergative language|ergative-absolutive]], although verbal morphology follows a [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|nominative-accusative]] pattern and pronouns are syntactically neutral.\n\nThe language distinguishes four persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th or 3rd reflexive (see [[#Obviation and switch-reference|Obviation and switch-reference]]), two numbers (singular and plural; no [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] as in Inuktitut), eight moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative, conditional, causative, contemporative and participial) and eight cases (absolutive, ergative, equative, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative and prolative). Verbs carry a bipersonal inflection for subject and object. Possessive noun phrases inflect for their possessor, as well as for case.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) pp. 33\u201334</ref>\n\nIn this section the examples are written in Greenlandic standard orthography except that morpheme boundaries are indicated by a hyphen.\n\n=== Syntax ===\nGreenlandic distinguishes three [[Open class (linguistics)|open word classes]]: [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s and [[Grammatical particle|particles]]. Verbs inflect for person and number of subject and object as well as for mood. Nouns inflect for possession and for case. Particles do not inflect.<ref name=\"Bj\u00f8rnum 2003\">Bj\u00f8rnum (2003)</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! &nbsp;!! Verb!! Noun!! Particle\n|-\n!

Since verbs inflect for number and person of both subject and object, the verb is in fact a clause itself. Therefore, clauses where all participants are expressed as free-standing noun phrases are rather rare.<ref name=\"Bj\u00f8rnum 2003\" /> The following examples show the possibilities of leaving out these verbal arguments:\n\nIntransitive clause with no subject noun phrase:\n: ''Sini-ppoq'' \"(S)he sleeps\"\n: sleep-3p/{{sc|IND}}<ref group=\"note\">In glosses of examples in Greenlandic the abbreviation \"3p\" means \"third person singular\" and has the same meaning as the English third person pronouns ''he'', ''she'' and ''it'', but it does not carry any information about gender.</ref>\n\nIntransitive clause with subject noun phrase:\n: ''Angut sinippoq'' \"the man sleeps\"\n: man.{{sc|ABS}} sleep-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n\nTransitive clause with no overt arguments:\n: ''Asa-vaa'' \"(S)he loves him/her/it\"\n: love-3p/3p\n\nTransitive clause with agent noun phrase:\n: ''Angut-ip asa-vaa'' \"the man loves him/her/it\"\n: man-{{sc|ERG}} love-3p/3p\n\nTransitive clause with patient noun phrase:\n: ''Arnaq asa-vaa'' \"(S)he loves the woman\"\n: woman.{{sc|ABS}} love-3p/3p\n\n==== Morphosyntactic alignment ====\nThe Greenlandic language uses [[case (grammar)|case]] to express grammatical relations between participants in a sentence. Nouns are inflected with one of the two core cases or one of the six oblique cases.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) p. 71</ref>\n\nGreenlandic is an [[Ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative]] language. This means that, instead of treating the [[morphosyntax|grammatical relations]] as in most European languages where grammatical [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] are marked with [[nominative case]] and [[object (grammar)|objects]] with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for [[Agent (grammar)|agents]] of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) pp. 71\u201372</ref> Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation has shown that the use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a [[nominative\u2013accusative language]].<ref>Langg\u00e5rd, Karen (2009) \"Grammatical structures in Greenlandic as found in texts written by young Greenlanders at the turn of the millennium\" chapter 15 in Mahieu & Tersis (2009) pp. 231\u2013247{{sic}}</ref>\n\nIntransitive:\n: ''Anda sini-ppoq'' \"Anda sleeps\"\n: Anda.{{sc|ABS}} sleep-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n\nTransitive with agent and object:\n: ''Anda-p nanoq taku-aa'' \"Anda sees a bear\"\n: Anda-{{sc|ERG}} bear.{{sc|ABS}} see-3p/3p\n\n==== Word order ====\nIn transitive clauses where both object and subject are expressed as free noun phrases, basic, pragmatically neutral word order is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|AOXV / SXV]], where X is a noun phrase in one of the oblique cases. This order is fairly free, though. [[Topic (linguistics)|Topical]] noun phrases occur at the beginning of a clause whereas new or emphasized information generally come last. This is usually the verb, but it can also be a [[Focus (linguistics)|focal]] subject or object as well. In spoken language also \"afterthought\" material or clarifications may follow the verb, usually in a lowered pitch.<ref>Fortescue (1993) p. 269</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, the noun phrase is characterized by a rigid order where the head of the phrase precedes any modifiers and the possessor precedes the possessum.<ref>Fortescue (1993) p. 269-270</ref>\n\nIn [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] clauses the order is usually Subject-Copula-Complement.\n\n: ''Andap tujuuluk pisiaraa'' \"Anda bought the sweater\"\n: Anda  sweater  bought\n: A      O         V\n\nAn attribute appears after its head noun.\n\n: ''Andap tujuuluk tungujortoq pisiaraa'' \"Anda bought the blue sweater\"\n: Anda sweater blue bought\n: A      O       X    V\n\nAn attribute of an incorporated noun appears after the verb:\n\n: ''Anda sanasuuvoq pikkorissoq'' \"Anda is a skilled carpenter\"\n: Anda carpenter.IS skilled\n: S     V          APP\n\n==== Coordination and subordination ====\nSyntactic [[Coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] and [[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]] is done by combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative) with predicates in the subordinate moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial). The contemporative has both coordinative and subordinative functions depending on context.<ref>Fortescue(1984) p. 34</ref> The relative order of the main clause and its coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free, and mostly subject to [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] concerns.<ref>Fortescue (1993) p. 270</ref>\n\n==== Obviation and switch-reference ====\nThe Greenlandic pronominal system includes a distinction known as [[obviative|obviation]]<ref>Bittner (1995) p. 80</ref> or [[switch-reference]].<ref>Fortescue 1991. 53 ff.</ref> There is a special so-called fourth person<ref>Woodbury (1983)</ref> used to denote a third person subject of a subordinate verb or the possessor of a noun that is coreferent with the third person subject of the matrix clause.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) pp. 152\u2013154</ref> Below are examples of the difference between third and fourth person:\n\n: ''illu-a taku-aa'' \"he saw his (the other man's) house\"\n: house-3{{sc|POSS}} see-3p/3p\n\n: ''illu-ni taku-aa'' \"he saw his own house\"\n: house-4{{sc|POSS}} see-3p/3p\n\n: ''Ole oqar-poq tillu-kkiga'' \"Ole said I had hit him (the other man)\"\n: Ole say-3p hit-I/3p\n\n: ''Ole oqar-poq tillu-kkini'' \"Ole said I had hit him (Ole)\"\n: Ole say-3p hit-I/4p<ref group=\"note\">The abbreviation \"4p\" refers to the fourth or reflexive person.</ref>\n\n: ''Eva iser-uni sini-ssaa-q'' \"When Eva comes in she'll sleep\"\n: Eva come.in-4p sleep-expect-3p\n\n: ''Eva iser-pat sini-ssaa-q'' When Eva comes in (s)he'll sleep (someone else).\n: Eva come.in-3p sleep-expect-3p\n\n==== Indefiniteness construction ====\nThere is no category of [[definiteness]] in Greenlandic, so the information whether participants are already known to the listener or new in the discourse is encoded by other means. According to some authors,  morphology related to transitivity such as the use of the construction sometimes called [[Antipassive voice|antipassive]]<ref>Kappel Schmidt (2003)</ref><ref name=\"Sadock 2003\">Sadock (2003)</ref> or intransitive object<ref>Fortescue (1984) p. 92 & p. 249</ref> conveys such meaning, along with strategies of noun incorporation of non-topical noun phrases.<ref>Hallman, Peter (n.d.) \"Definiteness in Inuktitut\"[http://hallklar.bol.ucla.edu/Inuktitut.pdf]{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} p. 2</ref><ref>van Geenhoven (1998)</ref> This view, however, is controversial.<ref name=\"Bittner 1987\">Bittner (1987)</ref>\n\nActive:\n: ''Piitap arfeq takuaa'' \"Peter saw the whale\"\n: Peter-{{sc|ERG}} whale see\n\nAntipassive/intransitive object:\n: ''Piitaq arfermik takuvoq'' \"Peter saw (a) whale\"\n: Peter-{{sc|ABS}} whale-{{sc|INSTR}} see\n\n=== Verbs ===\nThe morphology of Greenlandic verbs is enormously complex. The two main processes are [[inflection]] and [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]. Inflectional morphology includes the processes of obligatory inflection for mood, person, and [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] (tense/[[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] is not an inflectional category in Kalaallisut).<ref name=\"Shaer\">Shaer (2003)</ref><ref name=\"Bittner2005\">Bittner (2005)</ref><ref name=\"HayashiSprenger\">Hayashi& Spreng (2005)</ref> Derivational morphology modifies the meaning of verbs in a way similar to that expressed by [[adverb]]s in English. Derivational suffixes of this kind number in the hundreds. Many of these suffixes are so semantically salient that they are often referred to as [[postbase]]s rather than suffixes, particularly in the American tradition of Eskimo grammar.<ref>Fortescue (1980) note 1</ref> Such semantically \"heavy\" suffixes may express concepts such as \"to have\", \"to be\", \"to say\", or \"to think\". The Greenlandic verb word consists of a root + derivational suffixes/postbases + inflectional suffixes. Tense and aspect is marked by optional suffixes that appear between the derivational and inflectional suffixes.\n\n==== Inflection ====\nGreenlandic verbs inflect for [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four are used in independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: [[indicative]], [[Interrogative mood|interrogative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], [[optative]]. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or [[Negation (linguistics)|negative]] inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) p. 35-50</ref> The inflectional system is further complicated by the fact that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.<ref>Fortescue & Lennert Olsen (1992) pp. 112 and 119\u2013122)</ref>\n\n===== Indicative and interrogative moods =====\n\nThe indicative mood is used in all independent expository clauses. The interrogative mood is used for posing [[Question#Grammar|questions]]. Questions with the question particle ''immaqa'' \"maybe\" cannot use the interrogative mood.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) p. 39</ref>\n\n: ''napparsima-vit''? \"Are you sick?\" (interrogative mood)\n: be.sick-YOU/{{sc|INTERR}}\n\n: ''naamik, napparsima-nngila-nga''. \"No, I am not sick\" (indicative mood)\n: no, be.sick-{{sc|NEG}}-I/{{sc|IND}}\n\nTable 5 shows the intransitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb ''neri-'' \"to eat\" in the indicative and interrogative moods (question marks mark interrogative intonation\u2014questions have falling intonation on the last syllable as opposed to most [[Indo-European languages]] in which questions are marked by rising intonation). The indicative and the interrogative mood each have a transitive and an intransitive inflection, but here only the intransitive inflection is given. [[Consonant gradation]] like that in Finnish appears to show up in the verb conjugation (with strengthening to ''pp'' in the 3rd person plural and weakening to ''v'' elsewhere).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 5.

It is always combined with the second person. The optative is used to express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative have transitive and intransitive paradigms. There are two transitive positive imperative paradigms: a standard one, and one that is considered rude and is usually used to address children.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) p. 40-42</ref>\n\n: ''sini-git''! \"Sleep!\"\n: sleep-{{sc|IMP}}\n\n: ''sini-llanga'' \"Let me sleep!\"\n: sleep-1p.{{sc|OPT}}\n\n: ''sini-nnak''! \"Don't sleep!\"\n: sleep-{{sc|NEG}}.{{sc|IMP}}\n\n===== Conditional mood =====\nThe conditional mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning \"if\" or \"when\".<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) p. 45</ref>\n\n: ''seqinner-pat Eva ani-ssaa-q'' \"If the sun shines, Eva will go out\"\n: Sunshine-{{sc|COND}} Eva go.out-expect/3p\n\n===== Causative mood =====\nThe causative mood (sometimes called the ''conjunctive'') is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning \"because\", \"since\" or \"when\"; it is also sometimes used with the meaning of \"that\". The causative is also used in main clauses to imply some underlying cause.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum(2003) pp. 43\u201344</ref>\n\n: ''qasu-gami innar-poq'' \"He went to bed because he was tired\"\n: be.tired-{{sc|CAU}}/3p go.to.bed-3p\n\n: ''matta-ttor-ama'' \"I've eaten blubber (that's why I'm not hungry)\"\n: blubber-eat-{{sc|CAU}}/I\n\n: ''ani-guit eqqaama-ssa-vat teriannia-qar-mat'' \"If you go out, remember that there are foxes\"\n: go.out-{{sc|COND}}/{{sc|YOU}} remember-fut-{{sc|IMP}} fox-are-{{sc|CAUS}}\n\n===== Contemporative mood =====\nThe contemporative mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if the subject of the subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative can also be used to form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum(2003) pp.46\u201349</ref>\n\n: ''qasu-llunga angerlar-punga'' \"Being tired, I went home\"\n: be.tired-{{sc|CONT}}.{{sc|I}} go.home-I\n\n: ''98-inik ukio-qar-luni toqu-voq'' \"Being 98 years old, he/she died\", \"he/she was 98 when he/she died\"\n: 98-{{sc|INSTR}}.{{sc|PL}} year-have-{{sc|CONT}}.4p.{{sc|SG}} die-3p\n\n: ''Eva oqar-poq kami-it akiler-lugit'' \"Eva said she had paid for the boots\"\n: Eva say-3p boot-{{sc|PL}} pay-{{sc|CONT}}.3p.{{sc|PL}}\n\n===== Participial mood =====\nThe participial mood is used to construct a subordinate clause describing its subject in the state of carrying out an activity. It is used when the matrix clause and the subordinate clause have different subjects. It is often used in appositional phrases such as [[relative clauses]].<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003) pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\n: ''atuar-toq taku-ara'' \"I saw her read/{{sc|I}} saw that she read\"\n: read-{{sc|PART}}/3p see-I/3p\n\n: ''neriu-ppunga tiki-ssa-soq'' \"I hope he is coming/{{sc|I}} hope he'll come\"\n: hope-{{sc|I}} come-expect-{{sc|PART}}/3p\n\n==== Derivation ====\nVerbal derivation is extremely productive, and Greenlandic employs many hundreds of derivational suffixes. Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix, resulting in very long words. Below are given some examples of how derivational suffixes can change the meaning of verbs.\n\n-''katap''- \"be tired of\"\n: ''taku-katap-para'' \"I am tired of seeing it/him/her\"\n: see-tired.of-I/3p\n\n-''ler''- \"begin to/be about to\"\n: ''neri-ler-pugut'' \"We are about to eat\"\n: eat-begin-WE\n\n-''llaqqip''- \"be proficient at\"\n: ''erinar-su-llaqqip-poq'' \"She is good at singing\"\n: sing-{{sc|HAB}}-proficiently-3p\n\n-''niar''- \"plans to/wants to\"\n: ''aallar-niar-poq'' \"He plans to travel\"\n: travel-plan-3p\n\n: ''angerlar-niar-aluar-punga'' \"I was planning to go home though\"\n: go.home-plan-though-I\n\n-''ngajap''- \"almost\"\n: ''sini-ngajap-punga'' \"I had almost fallen asleep\"\n: sleep-almost-I\n\n-''nikuu-nngila''- \"has never\"\n: ''taku-nikuu-nngila-ra'' \"I have never seen it\"\n: see-never-{{sc|NEG}}-I/3p\n\n-''nngitsoor''- \"not anyway/afterall\"\n: ''tiki-nngitsoor-poq'' \"He hasn't arrived after all\"\n: arrive-not.afterall-3p\n\n==== Time reference and aspect ====\nGreenlandic grammar has morphological devices to mark a distinction between, for example, recent and distant past, but the use of these is not obligatory,<ref>Fortescue (1984:) p. 273</ref> and they should therefore rather be understood as parts of Greenlandic's extensive derivational system than as a system of [[Tense (grammar)|tense]] markers. Rather than by morphological marking, fixed temporal distance is expressed by temporal adverbials:<ref>Trondhjem (2009) pp. 173\u2013175</ref>\n\n: ''toqo-riikatap-poq'' \"He died long ago\"<ref name=\"Fortescue 1984 p. 273\">Fortescue (1984) p. 273</ref>\n: die-long.ago-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n: ''nere-qqammer-punga'' \"I ate recently\"<ref name=\"Fortescue 1984 p. 273\" />\n: eat-recently-I/{{sc|IND}}\n: ''ippassaq Piitaq arpap-poq'' \"Yesterday Peter was running.\"<ref name=\"Trondhjem 2009 p. 174\">Trondhjem (2009) p. 174</ref>\n: yesterday Peter-{{sc|ABS}} run-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n\nAll other things being equal and in the absence of any explicit adverbials, the indicative mood will be interpreted as complete or incomplete depending on the verbal [[Lexical aspect|aktionsart]].<ref name=\"Trondhjem 2009 p. 174\" />\n\n: ''Piitaq arpap-poq'' \"Peter runs\"<ref name=\"Trondhjem 2009 p. 174\" />\n: Peter-{{sc|ABS}} run-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n: ''Piitaq ani-voq'' \"Peter was gone out\"<ref name=\"Trondhjem 2009 p. 174\" />\n: Peter-{{sc|ABS}} go.out-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n\nBut if a sentence containing an atelic verbal phrase is embedded within the context of a past time narrative, it would be interpreted as past.<ref>Bittner (2005) p. 7</ref>\n\nGreenlandic has several purely derivational devices of expressing meaning related to aspect and aktionsart, e.g. ''sar'' expressing \"habituality\" and ''ssaar'' expressing \"stop to\".<ref>Fortescue (1984) pp. 276\u2013287. The dividing line between aktionsart, aspect and still other functions not fitting into these categories would yet have to be clarified.</ref> Next to these, there are at least two major perfect markers: ''sima'' and ''nikuu''. ''sima'' can occur in several positions with obviously different function<ref>Fortescue (1984) pp. 272\u2013273</ref> Rightmost position indicates evidential meaning, but this can be determined only if a number of suffixes are present.\n\n: ''tiki(t)-nikuu-sima-voq'' \"Apparently, she had arrived\"<ref>Trondhjem (2009) p. 177</ref>\n: arrive-NIKUU-SIMA-3p/{{sc|INT}}\n\nWith [[telicity|atelic verbs]], there is a regular contrast between indirective [[evidentiality]] marked by ''sima'' and witnessed evidentiality marked by ''nikuu''.<ref name=\"Trondhjem 2009 p. 179\">Trondhjem (2009) p. 179</ref> Due to its evidential meaning, the combination of first person and ''sima'' sometimes is marked.<ref>cp. Trondhjem (2009) p. 180</ref>\n\n: ''qia-sima-voq'' \"He cried (his eyes are swollen)\"\n: cry-SIMA-3p/{{sc|IND}}\n: ''qia-nikuu-voq'' \"He cried (I was there)\"\n: cry-NIKUU-3p/{{sc|IND}}<ref name=\"Trondhjem 2009 p. 179\" />\n\nIn the written language<ref name=\"Fortescue 1984 p. 273\" /> and more recently also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers, ''sima'' and ''nikuu'' can be used together with adverbials referring to a particular time in the past.<ref>Trondhjem (2009) pp. 179\u2013180</ref> That is, they might arguably mark time reference, but not yet systematically.\n\nJust as Greenlandic does not systematically mark past tense, the language also does not have a future tense. Rather, it employs three different strategies to express future meaning:\n* suffixes denoting cognitive states that show an attitude about prospective actions.\n: e.g. ''Ilimaga-ara aasaq manna Dudley qujanar-tor-si-ffigi-ssa-llugu'' \"I expect to get some fun out of Dudley this summer.\"\n:: expect-I/3p/{{sc|IND}} summer this Dudley be.fun-cn-get.from-expect-CONTEMPORATIVE/3p\n* inchoative suffixes creating telic actions which can then be understood as already having begun by virtue of the indicative mood.\n: e.g. ''Aggiuti-ler-para'' \"I've started to bring him.\"\n:: bring-begin-I/3p/{{sc|IND}}\n* moods that mark the speech act as a request or wish.<ref>cp.

Glosses standardised to the system used in this article.</ref>\n:: dog-{{sc|PL}} feed-please-we/them/{{sc|IMP}}\n\nWhile the status of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, some scholars have claimed that Greenlandic has a basic temporal distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix ''-ssa'' and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers.<ref>Fortescue (1984)</ref><ref>Trondhjem (2009)</ref> However, at least for literary Greenlandic, these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics that can be used to refer to the future via the strategies just described.<ref>Bittner (2005) pp. 11, 38\u201343</ref>\n\n==== Noun incorporation ====\nThere is also a debate in the linguistic literature whether Greenlandic has [[noun incorporation]]. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root can be incorporated into almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of [[morpheme]]s that require a noun root as their host and which form [[complex predicate]]s that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses.<ref name=\"Sadock 2003\" /><ref>Sadock (1980)</ref><ref>Sadock(1986)</ref><ref>Sadock (1999)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bulba.sdsu.edu/~malouf/papers/greenlandic.pdf|title=Malouf (1999)|website=sdsu.edu|accessdate=20 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030712004225/http://bulba.sdsu.edu/~malouf/papers/greenlandic.pdf|archive-date=2003-07-12|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>van Geenhoven (2002)</ref> This argument is supported by the fact that many of the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized.<ref>Marianne Mithun \"Polysynthesis in the Arctic\" in Mahieu and Tersis (2009).</ref> Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element.<ref>Mithun (1986)</ref><ref>Mithun (1984)</ref><ref>Rosen (1989)</ref> The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.\n\n''qimmeq'' \"dog\" + ''-qar- \"have\" (+ ''-poq'' \"3p\")\n: ''qimme-qar-poq'' \"She has a dog\"\n\n''illu'' \"house\" + -'lior''- \"make\"\n: ''illu-lior-poq'' \"She builds a house\"\n\n''kaffi'' \"coffee\" + -''sor''- \"drink/eat\"\n: kaffi-sor-poq \"She drinks coffee\"\n\n''puisi'' \"seal\" + -''nniar''- \"hunt\"\n: puisi-nniar-poq \"She hunts seal\"\n\n''allagaq'' \"letter\" + -''si''- \"receive\"\n: allagar-si-voq \"She has received a letter\"\n\n''anaana'' \"mother\" + -''a''- \"to be\"\n: anaana-a-voq \"She is a mother\"\n\n=== Nouns ===\nNouns are obligatorily inflected for case and number and optionally for number and person of possessor. Singular and plural are distinguished and 8 cases used: absolutive, ergative (relative), instrumental, allative, locative, ablative, prosecutive (also called vialis or prolative), and equative.<ref>Fortescue (1984) p. 71</ref> Case and number are marked by a single suffix. Nouns can be derived from verbs or from other nouns by a number of suffixes, e.g. ''atuar''- \"to read\" + -''fik'' \"place\" becomes ''atuarfik'' \"school\" and ''atuarfik'' + -''tsialak'' \"something good\" becomes ''atuarfitsialak'' \"good school\".\n\nThe fact that the possessive agreement suffixes on nouns and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs in a number of instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that Greenlandic has a distinction between transitive and intransitive nouns, parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.<ref>Sadock (2003) p. 5</ref><ref group=\"note\">For example the suffix with the shape -aa means \"his/hers/its\" when suffixed to a noun, but \"him/her/it\" when suffixed to a verb, likewise the suffix -ra either means \"my\" or \"me\" depending on whether it is suffixed on a verb or a noun.</ref>\n\n==== Pronouns ====\nThere are personal pronouns for first-, second-, and third-person singular and plural. These pronouns are optional as subjects or objects, but only when the verbal inflection refers to such arguments.<ref>Fortescue (1984) p. 252</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 200px; height: 200px;\"\n|+ Personal pronouns\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Singular\n! scope=\"col\" | Plural\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | First person\n| uanga || uagut\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Second person\n| illit || ilissi\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Third person\n| una || uku\n|}\n\nPersonal pronouns are, however, necessary in the oblique case:\n\n: ilin-nut  niri-qu-aa\n: thou all. eat tell-to 3s-3s-indic.\n: 'He told you to eat it'\n\n==== Case ====\nThe two grammatical core cases ergative and absolutive are used to express grammatical and syntactical roles of participant noun phrases.

The possessor is in the ergative case. There are different possessive paradigms for all of the different cases.<ref>Bj\u00f8rnum (2003)  p. 86</ref> Table 4 gives the possessive paradigm for the absolutive case of ''illu'' \"house\". Below are given examples of the use of the possessive inflection, the use of the ergative case for possessors and the use of fourth person possessors.\n\n: ''Anda-p illu-a'' \"Anda's house\"\n: Anda-{{sc|ERG}} house-3p/{{sc|POSS}}\n\n: ''Anda-p illu-ni taku-aa'' \"Anda sees his own house\"\n: Anda-{{sc|ERG}} house-4p/{{sc|POSS}} see-3p/3p\n\n: ''Anda-p illu-a taku-aa'' \"Anda sees his (the other man's) house\"\n: ''Anda-{{sc|ERG}} house-3p/{{sc|POSS}} see-3p/3p\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n[[File:Ilimmarfik.jpg|thumb|The orthography and vocabulary of the Greenlandic language is governed by ''Oqaasileriffik'', the Greenlandic language secretariat, located in the ''Ilimmarfik'' university campus in [[Nuuk]].]]\n\nGreenlandic [[vocabulary]] is mostly inherited from [[Proto-Eskimo\u2013Aleut]], but it has also taken a large number of loans from other languages, especially from Danish. Early loans from Danish have often become acculturated to the Greenlandic phonological system, for example the Greenlandic word ''palasi'' \"priest\" is a loan from the Danish \"pr\u00e6st\". But since Greenlandic has an enormous potential for the derivation of new words from existing roots, many modern concepts have Greenlandic names that have been invented rather than borrowed, e.g. ''qarasaasiaq'' \"computer\" which literally means \"artificial brain\". This potential for complex derivations also means that Greenlandic vocabulary is built on very few roots which combined with affixes come to form large word families.<ref name=\"encyc\" /> For example the root for \"tongue\" ''oqaq'' is used to derive the following words:\n\n* ''oqarpoq''          'says'\n* ''oqaaseq''          'word'\n* ''oqaluppoq''          'speaks'\n* ''oqaasilerisoq ''  'linguist'\n* ''oqaasilerissutit''  'grammar'\n* ''oqaluttualiortoq''  'author'\n* ''oqaasipiluuppaa''  'harangues him'\n* ''oqaloqatigiinneq''   'conversation'\n* ''oqaatiginerluppaa''  'speaks badly about him'\n\nLexical differences between dialects are often considerable. This is due to the earlier cultural practice of imposing [[taboo]] on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.<ref name=\"encyc\" />\n\n== Orthography ==\n[[File:\u0138ra in a dictionary (ubt).JPG|thumb|'''[[Kra (letter)|\u0138]]''' in a Greenlandic\u2013Danish dictionary from 1926]]Greenlandic is written with the [[Latin script]].  The alphabet:\n: A E F G I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V\nTo spell loanwords from other languages, especially from Danish and English, the additional letters ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''H'', ''W'', ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'', ''\u00c6'', ''\u00d8'' and ''\u00c5'' are used.<ref>Gr\u00f8nlands sprogn\u00e6vn (1992)</ref><ref>Petersen (1990)</ref> Greenlandic uses the symbols \"...\" and \u00bb...\u00ab as [[non-English usage of quotation marks|quotation marks]].\n\nFrom 1851 until 1973, Greenlandic was written in the alphabet invented by [[Samuel Kleinschmidt]]. This alphabet employed the special character ''[[Kra (letter)|kra]]'' ('''\u039a\u02bc / \u0138''') which was replaced by [[q]] in the 1973 reform.<ref>http://www.evertype.com/alphabets/greenlandic.pdf</ref> In the Kleinschmidt alphabet, long vowels and geminate consonants were indicated by means of diacritics on the vowels (in the case of consonant gemination, the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant). For example, the name ''Kalaallit Nunaat'' was spelled ''Kal\u00e2dlit Nun\u00e2t''. This scheme uses a [[circumflex accent]] ( \u02c6 ) to indicate a long vowel (''e.g.'', ''\u00e2t/\u00eet/\u00fbt'', modern: ''aat'', ''iit'', ''uut''), an [[acute accent]] ( \u00b4 ) to indicate gemination of the following consonant: (''i.e.'', ''\u00e1'', ''\u00ed'', ''\u00fa'' modern: ''a(kk)'', ''i(kk)'', ''u(kk)'')] and, finally, a [[tilde]] ( \u02dc ) or a [[grave accent]] ( ` ), depending on the author, indicates vowel length ''and'' gemination of the following consonant (''e.g.'', ''\u00e3t'', ''\u0129t'', ''\u0169t'' or ''\u00e0t'', ''\u00ect'', ''\u00f9t'', modern: ''aatt'', ''iitt'', ''uutt''). The letters ''\u00ea'' and ''\u00f4'', used only before ''r'' and ''q'', are now written ''ee'' and ''oo'' in Greenlandic. The spelling system of [[Nunatsiavummiutut]], spoken in [[Nunatsiavut]] in northeastern [[Labrador]], is derived from the old Greenlandic system.\n\nTechnically, the Kleinschmidt orthography focused upon morphology: the same derivational affix would be written in the same way in different contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://giellatekno.uit.no/cgi/d-kal.eng.html|title=Programs for analysing Greenlandic|author=|date=|website=giellatekno.uit.no|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref> whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.\n\n=== Sample text ===\n{{lang|kl|Inuit tamarmik inunngorput nammineersinnaassuseqarlutik assigiimmillu ataqqinassuseqarlutillu pisinnaatitaaffeqarlutik.

The earliest source to mention this is the 2nd Century CE text ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' (a part of ''[[Divyavadana]]''). According to this account, Pushyamitra (described as the last Mauryan king) wanted to be famous. His ministers advised him that as long as Buddhism remained the dominant faith, he would never be as famous as his ancestor [[Ashoka]], who had commissioned 84,000 [[stupa]]s. One advisor told him that he could become famous by destroying Buddhism. Pushyamitra then tried to destroy the [[Kukkutarama]] monastery, but it was saved by a miracle. He then proceeded to [[Sagala|Shakala]] in the north-west, where he offered a prize of one hundred ''dinara''s (gold coins) for every head of a Buddhist monk brought to him. Next, he proceeded to the Koshthaka kingdom, where a Buddhist [[yaksha]] named Damshtranivasin killed him and his army with help of another yaksha named Krimisha.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|pp=95-96}}{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=33}}\n\n{{quote|... Pushyamitra equipped a fourfold army, and intending to destroy the Buddhist religion, he went to the [[Kukkutarama]] (in [[Pataliputra]]). ...

In this campaign, he was supported by yakshas, ''kumbhanda''s, and other demons. However, when he reached the [[Bodhi tree]], the deity of that tree took the form of a beautiful woman and killed him.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=96}} ''Shariputrapariprichha'', translated into Chinese between 317 and 420 CE also mentions this legend, but this particular version is more detailed, and describes eastern India (not Kashmir) as the center of Pushyamitra's anti-Buddhist campaign.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=96}}\n\nThe medieval-era ''Arya-Manjushri-Mula-Kalpa'' mentions a wicked and foolish king named Gomimukhya (\"cattle-faced\"), or Gomishanda (\"Gomin, the bull\"), who seized the territory from the east to Kashmir, destroying monasteries and killing monks. Ultimately, he and his officers were killed in the north by falling mountain rocks.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=96}}{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=33-34}} This king is identified with Pushyamitra by some scholars.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jayantanuja |last=Bandyopadhyaya |title=Class and Religion in Ancient India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwUF11NRyT4C&pg=PA209 |year=2007 |publisher=Anthem |isbn=978-1-84331-332-8 |page=209 }}</ref>\n\nThe 16th-century Tibetan Buddhist historian [[Taranatha]] also states that Pushyamitra and his allies killed Buddhist monks and destroyed monasteries from ''madhyadesha'' (midland) to [[Jalandhar]]a. These activities wiped out the Buddhist doctrine from the north, within five years.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=96}}\n\n=== Authenticity of Buddhist claims ===\n[[File:Procession on Elephants. Bharhut, c. 100 BC. Indian Museum, Calcutta ei05-19.jpg|thumb|Men riding elephants. [[Bharhut]], Sunga period.]]\nBased on Buddhist tradition, some scholars believe that Pushyamitra was indeed a persecutor of the Buddhist faith. However, others believe that Buddhist scholars were biased against Pushyamitra, because he did not patronize them.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|pp=34-35}}\n\n[[Vincent Arthur Smith|V. A. Smith]] and H. P. Shastri believed that Pushyamitra's rebellion against the Maurya dynasty was a Brahminical reaction to the rise of Buddhism.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=34}} According to archaeologist [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]], there is evidence of some damage to Buddhist establishments at [[Takshashila]] around the time of Shunga rule. He also theorized that the [[Sanchi Stupa|Sanchi stupa]] was vandalized in 2nd century BCE (that is, during Pushyamitra's reign), before being rebuilt on a larger scale.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|pp=96-97}} G. R. Sharma, who excavated the Buddhist ruins at [[Kosambi|Kaushambi]], suggested that the destruction of the local monastery might have happened during the reign of Pushyamitra Shunga. P. K. Mishra believes that the damage to the [[Deur Kothar]] stupa is also datable to Pushyamitra's period.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=97}} H. C. Raychaudhari pointed out that Buddhist monuments were constructed at [[Bharhut]] during the Shunga rule.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=34}} However, according to N. N. Ghosh, these were constructed during the reign of later Shunga rulers, not Pushyamitra's period.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=97}}\n\nH. Bhattacharya theorized that Pushyamitra might have persecuted Buddhists for political, rather than religious, reasons: the politically active Buddhists probably supported the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek]] rivals of Pushyamitra, which might have prompted him to persecute them.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=100}} The ''Ashokavadana'' states that Pushyamitra declared a reward for killing Buddhist monks in [[Sagala|Shakala]] (present-day Sialkot), which was located near the Indo-Greek frontiers. According to K. P. Jayaswal, this further highlights a political motivation behind his alleged persecution of Buddhists.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|pp=99-100}}\n\nMany other scholars have expressed skepticism about the Buddhist claims of persecution by Pushyamitra. [[\u00c9tienne Lamotte]] points out that the Buddhist legends are not consistent about the location of Pushyamitra's anti-Buddhist campaign and his death.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=98}} The ''Ashokavadana'' claims that Pushyamitra offered ''dinara''s as a reward for killing Buddhist monks, but the ''dinara'' did not come into circulation in India before the 1st century CE. ''Ashokavadana'' also claims that Ashoka persecuted ''Nirgrantha''s ([[Ajivika]]s), which is an obvious fabrication, considering that Ashoka's edicts express tolerance towards all religious sects.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=99}} The Sri Lankan Buddhist text ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' suggests that several monasteries existed in present-day Bihar, Awadh and Malwa at the time Pushyamitra's contemporary [[Dutthagamani]] ruled in Lanka. This suggests that these monasteries survived Pushyamitra Shunga's reign.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=100}}\n\nH. C. Raychaudhury argued that Pushyamitra's overthrow of the Mauryans cannot be considered as a Brahmin uprising against Buddhist rule, as Brahmins did not suffer during the Mauryan rule: Ashoka's edicts mention the Brahmins before [[Shramana]]s, and the appointment of a Brahmin general (Pushyamitra) shows that the Brahmins were honoured at the Mauryan court.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=34}} The fact that the ''Ashokavadana'' mentions Pushyamitra as a Mauryan further erodes its historical credibility, and weakens the hypothesis that he persecuted Buddhists because he was a Brahmin.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=99}} Raychaudhury also aruged that according to ''[[Malavikagnimitra]]'', a Buddhist nun named Bhagavati Kaushiki attended Pushyamitra's court, which indicates that they did not persecute Buddhists. However, Shankar Goyal states that there is no evidence of Kaushiki being a Buddhist nun.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxpuAAAAMAAJ |title=Aspects of ancient Indian history and historiography |author=Shankar Goyal |publisher=Harman |year=1993 |isbn=9788185151694 |page=30 }}</ref> [[Romila Thapar]] writes that the lack of concrete archaeological evidence casts doubt on the claims of Buddhist persecution by Pushyamitra.<ref>A\u015boka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press, 1960 P200</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the Buddhist influence at the Mauryan court declined during Pushyamitra's reign, and the Buddhist monasteries and other institutions stopped receiving royal patronage. This change might have led to discontent among the Buddhists, resulting in exaggerated accounts of persecution.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|pp=99-100}}\n\n[[Michael Witzel]] states that ''[[Manu Smriti|Manudharma]]'', which emphasizes the role of orthodox faith in state-craft and society, was first compiled under Pushyamitra's rule.

In 1988, according with the new educational legislation, a new university was founded on the base of the Valparaiso Business School (Escuela de Negocios de Valparaiso), an old institution for the professional teaching in business administration founded in 1953 thanks to the contribution of [[Adolfo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Boggiano]]. The new university would take its name some decades later.\n\nIn the Chilean higher educational scheme, UAI is a private university accredited in the country by the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Acreditaci\u00f3n (CNA) and internationally by [[AACSB]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]].\n\nThe Adolfo Iba\u00f1ez University is ranked 1\u00b0 Private University in Chile according to Am\u00e9rica Econom\u00eda, and the CSIC (Spanish institution for University research)\n\n==History==\n\nThe Valparaiso Business School (Escuela de Negocios de Valpara\u00edso), was established in 1953 under the protection of the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso. It is noted for being the first educational institution in Chile to offer the [[Business administration|business administration career]], as well as one of pioneers{{Dubious|date=February 2010}} in [[Latin America]].\n\nIn 1995, the humanistic subjects were introduced into the career to make a little change in the students of a career like Business administration.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the alliance between the business school and the university was broken, and after a few years of autonomy, a new alliance was signed with the [[Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda|Federico Santa Mar\u00eda Technical University]], a new association that would remain until the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1979, it became the first business school to introduce an [[MBA]] program in Chile.\n\nAfter the educational reform brought about by the [[Chile under Pinochet|military government]], in the last years of the 1980 decade, Adolfo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez University was founded with the business school like central axis. In 1989 the careers of [[Laws]] and [[Engineering]] were opened, in 1996 [[Journalism]] and [[Pedagogy]] and in 2002 [[Psychology]]. During 2002 the new [[Pe\u00f1alolen]] Campus was opened in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]].\n\nIn 2006, this organization founded the Adolfo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez School of Management, settling this school for post-graduate programs in Miami. It is the first Latin-American MBA program, to be certified by the US government.\n\nIn March 2009, this institution settled the arrangements, so the students of the Master in Finance can easily perform the CFA ([[Chartered Financial Analyst]]) international exams, and so obtain their certification, due to the needs that the market has applied to the graduated students.

Anderson School of Management]]), in which establishes that one fourth of the Global Executive MBA is to be done in Chile, while the rest, in the exterior.

In 1988, according with the new educational legislation, a new university was founded on the base of the Valparaiso Business School (Escuela de Negocios de Valparaiso), an old institution for the professional teaching in business administration founded in 1953 thanks to the contribution of [[Adolfo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Boggiano]]. The new university would take its name some decades later.\n\nIn the Chilean higher educational scheme, UAI is a private university accredited in the country by the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Acreditaci\u00f3n (CNA) and internationally by [[AACSB]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]].\n\nThe Adolfo Iba\u00f1ez University is ranked 1\u00b0 Private University in Chile according to Am\u00e9rica Econom\u00eda, and the CSIC (Spanish institution for University research)\n\n==History==\n\n\nThe Valparaiso Business School (Escuela de Negocios de Valpara\u00edso), was established in 1953 under the protection of the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso. It is noted for being the first educational institution in Chile to offer the [[Business administration|business administration career]], as well as one of pioneers{{Dubious|date=February 2010}} in [[Latin America]].\n\nIn 1995, the humanistic subjects were introduced into the career to make a little change in the students of a career like Business administration.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the alliance between the business school and the university was broken, and after a few years of autonomy, a new alliance was signed with the [[Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda|Federico Santa Mar\u00eda Technical University]], a new association that would remain until the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1979, it became the first business school to introduce an [[MBA]] program in Chile. \n\nAfter the educational reform brought about by the [[Chile under Pinochet|military government]], in the last years of the 1980 decade, Adolfo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez University was founded with the business school like central axis. In 1989 the careers of [[Laws]] and [[Engineering]] were opened, in 1996 [[Journalism]] and [[Pedagogy]] and in 2002 [[Psychology]]. During 2002 the new [[Pe\u00f1alolen]] Campus was opened in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]].\n\nIn 2006, this organization founded the Adolfo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez School of Management, settling this school for post-graduate programs in Miami. It is the first Latin-American MBA program, to be certified by the US government. \n\nIn March 2009, this institution settled the arrangements, so the students of the Master in Finance can easily perform the CFA ([[Chartered Financial Analyst]]) international exams, and so obtain their certification, due to the needs that the market has applied to the graduated students.

The [[Financial Times]] establishes this Indian institution in the 15th position among the whole globe, <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isb.edu/ISBWEB/ISBCMS/File/FT_GlobalMBARanking09.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171810/http://www.isb.edu/ISBWEB/ISBCMS/File/FT_GlobalMBARanking09.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref> in matters of post-graduate programs.\n\nIn May 2010, Adolfo Iba\u00f1ez business School closes a strategic alliance for Dual Degree with [[UCLA]] ([[John E. Anderson School of Management]]), in which establishes that one fourth of the Global Executive MBA is to be done in Chile, while the rest, in the exterior.  Until [[UCLA]] had his mind set up, the final competitors in consideration were three; Adolfo Iba\u00f1ez Business School, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, and the ITAM (Mexican's Institute).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mba.americaeconomia.com/articulos/reportajes/ucla-y-uai-una-alianza-sin-precedentes |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170601/http://mba.americaeconomia.com/articulos/reportajes/ucla-y-uai-una-alianza-sin-precedentes |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref> This does represent a huge achievement because no Latin American university has a Dual Degree with a Top 10 North American institution.\n==Educational Model==\n\nSince 2002, in this institution, the plan was to put in use the model that many prestigious universities use abroad. This is why students now have: a major, minors and fundamental subjects. The major is normally engineering, literature, psychology, etc. The minor can be done in quite different fields, such as: drama, music, philosophy, etc. And the fundamental subjects (which are all the same for every career) have been using successfully for more than 9 years now the US college program. <ref>[http://www.uai.cl/prontus3_newsletter/site/artic/20081015/pags/20081015120659.html]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref>\n\n==Pe\u00f1alol\u00e9n Campus==\n\n\nThe Pe\u00f1alol\u00e9n campus is located at the eastern edge of Santiago, sprawling over nearly {{convert|250|acre|km2}} in the foothills of San Ram\u00f3n Hill, in the city\u2019s Pe\u00f1alol\u00e9n Municipality.\n\nThe university buildings occupy nearly {{convert|110000|sqft|m2}} and are used mainly by undergraduate students. All classrooms are equipped with audiovisual media resources. There is a computer room for training and personal work, and the campus has network connections throughout. In addition, there are five computer labs for Civil Engineering. \n\nThe campus has a gym with machines and aerobics rooms, which each enrolled student is able to use via biometric log in. There are also several cafeterias across the campus which can be used by students not just for eating, but also for holding meetings and socializing. There are currently 680 parking spaces available for students.\n\n==Presidente Err\u00e1zuriz Campus==\n\nThe Presidente Err\u00e1zuriz campus in the Las Condes section of northeast Santiago is dedicated mainly to postgraduate programs. It is here that seminar program classes are held.  It has two amphitheater-style classrooms with audio equipment. There are also climate-controlled study rooms and work cubicles with computers for students.\n\nThe offices of the Dean of the Adolfo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez University Business School and many business department professors are located on this campus.\n\n==Recreo Campus - Vi\u00f1a del Mar==\n\nNestled in a venerable residential neighborhood in Vi\u00f1a del Mar, the Recreo campus includes an inviting group of buildings whose architecture was designed to provide an optimal academic setting, with amphitheater-style classrooms and a central courtyard offering a stunning panorama of Vi\u00f1a del Mar and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nOne of the focal points of the campus is the house that Adolfo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Boggiano built in the 1930s, which is now ringed by the various buildings that make up the present-day campus. \n\n==Sporting Club Campus==\n\nIt was expected to be operational at the beginning of 2011. This campus was designed to replace the old Recreo Campus because the old building does not suit the actual requirements of the university in Vi\u00f1a del Mar. It was to consist of four structures, pulled up together to constitute the main center of operations in that region. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uai.cl/carreras/proyecto-sede-vina-del-mar |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419135925/http://www.uai.cl/carreras/proyecto-sede-vina-del-mar |archivedate=2010-04-19 }}.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.uai.cl Official Website Universidad Adolfo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Chile]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adolfo Ibanez, Universidad}}\n[[Category:Universities in Chile]]\n[[Category:Business schools in Chile]]\n[[Category:Universities in Santiago Metropolitan Region]]\n[[Category:1953 establishments in Chile]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolfo_Ib%C3%A1%C3%B1ez_University"}
