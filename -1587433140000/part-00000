Crawford then signed a motion picture contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1925; her career spanned six decades, multiple studios, and controversies.\n\nAt different stages of her career, she was noted for her diverse roles playing sympathetic and unsympathetic characters, and for realistic yet multi-layered performances. Her films ranged in genres from contemporary crime, melodramas, film noir, several historical costume dramas, romances, mysteries, musicals, suspense, horror, to three westerns and over a dozen comedies. Regardless, her greater successes and perhaps most memorable performances were in romantic dramas and melodramas. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Crawford tenth on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema]].\n\nIn the 1930s, Crawford's fame rivaled and later surpassed that of MGM colleagues [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Greta Garbo]]. Though she started portraying flappers, Crawford often played wealthy women in distress (''[[Dance, Fools, Dance]]'', ''[[This Modern Age]]'', ''[[Letty Lynton]]'',  ''[[No More Ladies]]'', ''[[I Live My Life]]'', ''[[Susan and God]]'') or hard-working young women who found romance and success (''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'', ''[[Paid (1930 film)|Paid]]'', ''[[Laughing Sinners]]'' , ''[[Dancing Lady]]'', ''[[Sadie McKee]]'', ''[[The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (1937 film)|The Last of Mrs. Cheyney]]'', ''[[The Shining Hour]]'', ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'', ''[[Mannequin]]''). These characters and stories were well received by [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era audiences, and were popular with women. Crawford became one of Hollywood's more prominent movie stars, and one of the higher-paid women in the United States.\n\nIn 1945, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her work in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'', and received Best Actress nominations for ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947) and ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952). Crawford continued to act in film and television throughout the 1950s and 1960s; she returned to box office success and critical acclaim with [[horror film]] ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962), in which she starred alongside her long-time rival [[Bette Davis]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/fx-feud-joan-crawford-bette-davis-oscars|title=Fact-Checking Feud: Joan Crawford and Bette Davis's 1963 Oscar Showdown|last=Miller|first=Julie|work=HWD|access-date=September 22, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, Crawford became involved with the Pepsi-Cola Company through her marriage to company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer [[Alfred Steele]].\n\nIn 1970 Crawford made her last theatrical film, and until a few weeks before her death, she continued to tape numerous regular radio spots and announcements for a variety of not-for-profit causes.

Crawford's relationships with her two elder children, [[Christina Crawford|Christina]] and Christopher, were acrimonious.

Shubert]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Shubert put her in the chorus line for his 1924 show, ''Innocent Eyes'', at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on Broadway in New York City. While appearing in ''Innocent Eyes'', Crawford met a saxophone player named James Welton. The two were allegedly married in 1924, and lived together for several months, although this supposed marriage was never mentioned in later life by Crawford.<ref name=considine12>Considine, p. 12</ref>\n\nCrawford wanted additional work, and approached [[Loews Theaters]] publicist [[Nils Granlund]].

She also appeared in ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' and ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' (both 1925), starring comedian [[ZaSu Pitts]]. This was soon followed by equally small and [[Billing (filmmaking)|unbilled]] roles in two other 1925 silent films: ''[[The Only Thing]]'', and ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald Spoto|title=Possessed: The Life of Joan Crawford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouUt6jGDAhgC|date=February 3, 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-8811-2|page=22}}</ref>\n\nMGM publicity head [[Pete Smith (film producer)|Pete Smith]] recognized her ability to become a major star, but felt her name sounded fake; he told studio head [[Louis B.

The initial choice was \"Joan Arden\", but after another actress was found to have prior claim to that name, the alternate surname \"Crawford\" became the choice.

From the beginning of her career, Crawford considered Norma Shearer \u2013 the studio's most-popular actress \u2013 her professional nemesis. Shearer was married to MGM Head of Production [[Irving Thalberg]]; hence, she had the first choice of scripts, and had more control than other stars in what films she would and would not make.

The transition from silent to sound caused panic for many, if not all, involved with the film industry; many silent film stars found themselves unemployable because of their undesirable voices and hard-to-understand accents, or simply because of their refusal to make the transition to talkies.\n\nMany studios and stars avoided making the transition as long as possible, especially MGM, which was the last of the major studios to switch over to sound. ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'' was one of the studio's first all-talking films, and their first attempt to showcase their stars' ability to make the transition from silent to sound. Crawford was among the dozen or more MGM stars included in the movie; she sang the song \"Got a Feeling for You\" during the film's first act.\n\nCrawford made a successful transition to talkies with her first starring role in the all-talking feature-length film in ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), co-starring [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]].

Her first film for the studio was ''[[Hollywood Canteen (film)|Hollywood Canteen]]'' (1944), an all-star morale-booster film that teamed her with several other top movie stars at the time. Crawford said one of the main reasons she signed with Warner Bros. was because she wanted to play the character \"Mattie\" in a proposed 1944 film version of [[Edith Wharton]]'s novel ''[[Ethan Frome]]'' (1911).\n[[File:Joan Crawford in Mildred Pierce trailer.jpg|thumb|''Mildred Pierce'' trailer (1945)|alt=]]\nShe wanted to play the title role in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945), but [[Bette Davis]] was the studio's first choice. However, Davis turned the role down. Director [[Michael Curtiz]] did not want Crawford to play the part, and he instead lobbied for the casting of [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. Warner Bros. defied Curtiz and cast Crawford in the film. Throughout the entire production of the movie, Curtiz criticized Crawford. \"She comes over here with her high-hat airs and her goddamn shoulder pads... Why should I waste my time directing a has-been?\"<ref>Curtiz, quoted in Thomas, p. 146</ref> Curtiz demanded Crawford prove her suitability by taking a screen test; she agreed. After the test, Curtiz agreed to Crawford's casting. Costume fittings started filming off roughly when Curtiz suspected Crawford of wearing shoulder pads and he proceeded to tear the top of her dress. She said \"Thankfully I was wearing a bra.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4G4uCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=joan+crawford+curtiz+shoulder+pad#v=onepage&q=joan%20crawford%20curtiz%20shoulder%20pad&f=false|title=Creating the Illusion: A Fashionable History of Hollywood Costume Designers|last=Jorgensen|first=Jay|last2=Scoggins|first2=Donald L.|date=2015-10-06|publisher=Running Press|isbn=9780762458073|language=en}}</ref> ''Mildred Pierce'' was a resounding critical and commercial success.

For several years, she starred in what were called \"a series of first-rate [[melodrama]]s\". Her next film was ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), co-starring [[John Garfield]], a romantic drama about a love affair between an older woman and a younger man. She starred alongside [[Van Heflin]] in ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947), for which she received a second Academy Award nomination. In ''[[Daisy Kenyon]]'' (1947), she appeared opposite [[Dana Andrews]] and [[Henry Fonda]], and in ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), her character has an ultimately deadly feud with a corrupt southern sheriff played by [[Sydney Greenstreet]]. She made a cameo in ''[[It's a Great Feeling]]'' (1949), poking fun at her own screen image. In 1950, she starred in the film noir ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' and in the melodrama ''[[Harriet Craig]]''.\n\nIn 1947, Crawford adopted two more children, whom she named Cindy and Cathy.

After a 10-year absence from MGM, she returned to that studio to star in ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'' (1953), a musical drama centering on the life of a demanding stage star who falls in love with a blind pianist, played by [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]]. Although the film was highly publicized as Crawford's major comeback, it was a critical and financial failure, known today for its [[Camp (style)|camp]] appeal. In 1954, she starred in ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', a [[Cult Classics|cult classic]] directed by [[Nicholas Ray]], co-starring [[Sterling Hayden]] and [[Mercedes McCambridge]].

Although she was not the star of the film, she received positive reviews. Crawford later named the role as being one of her personal favorites.

(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962). Despite the actresses' earlier tensions, Crawford reportedly suggested [[Bette Davis]] for the role of Jane. The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them. The director, [[Robert Aldrich]], fueling publicity rumors, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers, and commented, \"It's proper to say that they really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly.\"<ref>Considine, ibid.</ref>\n\nAfter filming was completed, their public comments against each other propelled their animosity into a life-long feud. The film was a huge success, recouping its costs within eleven days of its nationwide release reviving Davis and Crawford's careers. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. Crawford contacted each of the other Oscar nominees in the category ([[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Geraldine Page]], and [[Anne Bancroft]], all East Coast-based actresses), to let them know that if they could not attend the ceremony, she would be happy to accept the Oscar on their behalf; all agreed. Both Davis and Crawford were backstage - Crawford having presented best director - when the absent [[Anne Bancroft]] was announced as the winner and Crawford accepted the award on her behalf. Davis claimed for the rest of her life that Crawford had campaigned against her, a charge Crawford denied.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThat same year, Crawford starred as Lucy Harbin in [[William Castle]]'s horror mystery ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' (1964). [[Robert Aldrich]] cast Crawford and Davis in ''[[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964). After a purported campaign of harassment by Davis on location in Louisiana, Crawford returned to Hollywood entering a hospital. After a prolonged absence, during which Crawford was accused of feigning illness, Aldrich was forced to replace her with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. Crawford, who was devastated, said \"I heard the news of my replacement over the radio, lying in my hospital bed ... I cried for nine hours.\"<ref>Thomas, p. 225</ref> Crawford nursed grudges against Davis and Aldrich for the rest of her life, saying of Aldrich, \"He is a man who loves evil, horrendous, vile things\", to which Aldrich replied \"If the shoe fits, wear it, and I am very fond of Miss Crawford\".<ref>Considine, p. 363</ref> Despite being replaced, brief footage of Crawford made it into the film when she is seen sitting in a taxi in a wide shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K_40HXjkKw|title=The References: \"Feud\" Episode 7 + \"Hush...

Crawford then signed a motion picture contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1925; her career spanned six decades, multiple studios, and controversies.\n\nAt different stages of her career, she was noted for her diverse roles playing sympathetic and unsympathetic characters, and for realistic yet multi-layered performances. Her films ranged in genres from contemporary crime, melodramas, film noir, several historical costume dramas, romances, mysteries, musicals, suspense, horror, to three westerns and over a dozen comedies. Regardless, her greater successes and perhaps most memorable performances were in romantic dramas and melodramas. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Crawford tenth on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema]].\n\nIn the 1930s, Crawford's fame rivaled and later surpassed that of MGM colleagues [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Greta Garbo]]. Though she started portraying flappers, Crawford often played wealthy women in distress (''[[Dance, Fools, Dance]]'', ''[[This Modern Age]]'', ''[[Letty Lynton]]'',  ''[[No More Ladies]]'', ''[[I Live My Life]]'', ''[[Susan and God]]'') or hard-working young women who found romance and success (''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'', ''[[Paid (1930 film)|Paid]]'', ''[[Laughing Sinners]]'' , ''[[Dancing Lady]]'', ''[[Sadie McKee]]'', ''[[The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (1937 film)|The Last of Mrs. Cheyney]]'', ''[[The Shining Hour]]'', ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'', ''[[Mannequin]]''). These characters and stories were well received by [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era audiences, and were popular with women. Crawford became one of Hollywood's more prominent movie stars, and one of the higher-paid women in the United States.\n\nIn 1945, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her work in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'', and received Best Actress nominations for ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947) and ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952). Crawford continued to act in film and television throughout the 1950s and 1960s; she returned to box office success and critical acclaim with [[horror film]] ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962), in which she starred alongside her long-time rival [[Bette Davis]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/fx-feud-joan-crawford-bette-davis-oscars|title=Fact-Checking Feud: Joan Crawford and Bette Davis's 1963 Oscar Showdown|last=Miller|first=Julie|work=HWD|access-date=September 22, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, Crawford became involved with the Pepsi-Cola Company through her marriage to company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer [[Alfred Steele]].\n\nIn 1970 Crawford made her last theatrical film, and until a few weeks before her death, she continued to tape numerous regular radio spots and announcements for a variety of not-for-profit causes.

Crawford's relationships with her two elder children, [[Christina Crawford|Christina]] and Christopher, were acrimonious.

Shubert]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Shubert put her in the chorus line for his 1924 show, ''Innocent Eyes'', at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on Broadway in New York City. While appearing in ''Innocent Eyes'', Crawford met a saxophone player named James Welton. The two were allegedly married in 1924, and lived together for several months, although this supposed marriage was never mentioned in later life by Crawford.<ref name=considine12>Considine, p. 12</ref>\n\nCrawford wanted additional work, and approached [[Loews Theaters]] publicist [[Nils Granlund]].

She also appeared in ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' and ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' (both 1925), starring comedian [[ZaSu Pitts]]. This was soon followed by equally small and [[Billing (filmmaking)|unbilled]] roles in two other 1925 silent films: ''[[The Only Thing]]'', and ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald Spoto|title=Possessed: The Life of Joan Crawford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouUt6jGDAhgC|date=February 3, 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-8811-2|page=22}}</ref>\n\nMGM publicity head [[Pete Smith (film producer)|Pete Smith]] recognized her ability to become a major star, but felt her name sounded fake; he told studio head [[Louis B.

The initial choice was \"Joan Arden\", but after another actress was found to have prior claim to that name, the alternate surname \"Crawford\" became the choice. She later said that she wanted her first name to be pronounced Jo-Anne, and that she hated the name Crawford because it sounded like \"crawfish\", but also admitted she \"liked the security\" that went with the name.<ref>Crawford, quoted in Newquist, p. 31</ref>\n\n===Self-promotion, and early successes===\nGrowing increasingly frustrated over the size and quality of the parts she was given, Crawford embarked on a campaign of self-promotion.

Joan Crawford became a star because Joan Crawford decided to become a star.\"<ref>Maas, quoted in LaSalle, p. 123</ref> She began attending dances in the afternoons and evenings at hotels around Hollywood and at dance venues on the beach piers, where she often won dance competitions with her performances of the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] and the [[Black Bottom (dance)|Black Bottom]].<ref>Thompson, p. 47</ref>\n[[File:Crawford-Gilbert-1928.JPG|thumb|upright|With John Gilbert in the film ''[[Four Walls (film)|Four Walls]]'' (1928)]]\nHer strategy worked and MGM cast her in the film where she first made an impression on audiences, [[Edmund Goulding]]'s ''[[Sally, Irene and Mary]]'' (1925). From the beginning of her career, Crawford considered Norma Shearer \u2013 the studio's most-popular actress \u2013 her professional nemesis. Shearer was married to MGM Head of Production [[Irving Thalberg]]; hence, she had the first choice of scripts, and had more control than other stars in what films she would and would not make.

The transition from silent to sound caused panic for many, if not all, involved with the film industry; many silent film stars found themselves unemployable because of their undesirable voices and hard-to-understand accents, or simply because of their refusal to make the transition to talkies.\n\nMany studios and stars avoided making the transition as long as possible, especially MGM, which was the last of the major studios to switch over to sound. ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'' was one of the studio's first all-talking films, and their first attempt to showcase their stars' ability to make the transition from silent to sound. Crawford was among the dozen or more MGM stars included in the movie; she sang the song \"Got a Feeling for You\" during the film's first act.\n\nCrawford made a successful transition to talkies with her first starring role in the all-talking feature-length film in ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), co-starring [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]].

She unexpectedly slipped from seventh to sixteenth place at the box office that year, and her public popularity also began to wane.<ref name=\"Thomas, p. 113\">Thomas, p. 113</ref> [[Richard Boleslawski]]'s comedy-drama ''[[The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (1937 film)|The Last of Mrs. Cheyney]]'' (1937) teamed her opposite [[William Powell]] in their sole screen pairing.

The film was generally unfavorably reviewed by the majority of critics. It also ran a financial loss, becoming one of MGM's biggest failures of the year. ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'', co-starring Spencer Tracy, also released in 1937 did, as the ''New York Times'' stated, \"restore Crawford to her throne as queen of the working girls\".\n[[File:Crawford+tone 1936.jpg|thumb|left|Crawford with second husband, actor [[Franchot Tone]], 1936|alt=]]\nOn May 3, 1938, Crawford\u2014along with Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, [[Luise Rainer]], John Barrymore, [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], and others\u2014was dubbed \"[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|Box Office Poison]]\" in an open letter in the ''Independent Film Journal''. The list was submitted by Harry Brandt, president of the Independent Theatre Owners Association of America. Brandt stated that while these stars had \"unquestioned\" dramatic abilities, their high salaries did not reflect in their ticket sales, thus hurting the movie exhibitors involved. Crawford's follow-up movie, ''[[The Shining Hour]]'' (1938), co-starring [[Margaret Sullavan]] and [[Melvyn Douglas]], was well received by critics, but it was a box-office flop.<ref>Thomas, p. 115</ref>\n\nShe made a comeback in 1939 with her role as home-wrecker Crystal Allen in ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'', opposite her professional nemesis, Norma Shearer. A year later, she played against type in the unglamorous role of Julie in ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940), her eighth\u2014and final\u2014film with Clark Gable. She later starred as a facially disfigured blackmailer in ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' (1941), a remake of the Swedish film ''[[A Woman's Face (1938 film)|En kvinnas ansikte]]'' which had starred [[Ingrid Bergman]] in the lead role three years earlier. While the film was only a moderate box office success, Crawford's performance was hailed by many critics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1941/05/16/archives/at-the-capitol.html|title=At the Capitol|last=T.s|date=1941-05-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nCrawford adopted her first child, a daughter, in 1940. Because she was single, California law prevented her from adopting within the state; so, she arranged the adoption through an agency in Las Vegas.

In lieu of the last film remaining under her contract, MGM bought her out for $100,000.\n\n===Move to Warner Bros.===\nFor $500,000, Crawford signed with [[Warner Bros.]] for a three-movie deal, and was placed on the payroll on July 1, 1943. Her first film for the studio was ''[[Hollywood Canteen (film)|Hollywood Canteen]]'' (1944), an all-star morale-booster film that teamed her with several other top movie stars at the time. Crawford said one of the main reasons she signed with Warner Bros. was because she wanted to play the character \"Mattie\" in a proposed 1944 film version of [[Edith Wharton]]'s novel ''[[Ethan Frome]]'' (1911).\n[[File:Joan Crawford in Mildred Pierce trailer.jpg|thumb|''Mildred Pierce'' trailer (1945)|alt=]]\nShe wanted to play the title role in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945), but [[Bette Davis]] was the studio's first choice. However, Davis turned the role down. Director [[Michael Curtiz]] did not want Crawford to play the part, and he instead lobbied for the casting of [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. Warner Bros. defied Curtiz and cast Crawford in the film. Throughout the entire production of the movie, Curtiz criticized Crawford. \"She comes over here with her high-hat airs and her goddamn shoulder pads... Why should I waste my time directing a has-been?\"<ref>Curtiz, quoted in Thomas, p. 146</ref> Curtiz demanded Crawford prove her suitability by taking a screen test; she agreed. After the test, Curtiz agreed to Crawford's casting. Costume fittings started filming off roughly when Curtiz suspected Crawford of wearing shoulder pads and he proceeded to tear the top of her dress.

For several years, she starred in what were called \"a series of first-rate [[melodrama]]s\". Her next film was ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), co-starring [[John Garfield]], a romantic drama about a love affair between an older woman and a younger man. She starred alongside [[Van Heflin]] in ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947), for which she received a second Academy Award nomination. In ''[[Daisy Kenyon]]'' (1947), she appeared opposite [[Dana Andrews]] and [[Henry Fonda]], and in ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), her character has an ultimately deadly feud with a corrupt southern sheriff played by [[Sydney Greenstreet]]. She made a cameo in ''[[It's a Great Feeling]]'' (1949), poking fun at her own screen image. In 1950, she starred in the film noir ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' and in the melodrama ''[[Harriet Craig]]''.\n\nIn 1947, Crawford adopted two more children, whom she named Cindy and Cathy.

Although the film was highly publicized as Crawford's major comeback, it was a critical and financial failure, known today for its [[Camp (style)|camp]] appeal. In 1954, she starred in ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', a [[Cult Classics|cult classic]] directed by [[Nicholas Ray]], co-starring [[Sterling Hayden]] and [[Mercedes McCambridge]].

The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them.

The film was a huge success, recouping its costs within eleven days of its nationwide release reviving Davis and Crawford's careers. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. Crawford contacted each of the other Oscar nominees in the category ([[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Geraldine Page]], and [[Anne Bancroft]], all East Coast-based actresses), to let them know that if they could not attend the ceremony, she would be happy to accept the Oscar on their behalf; all agreed.

After a purported campaign of harassment by Davis on location in Louisiana, Crawford returned to Hollywood entering a hospital.
