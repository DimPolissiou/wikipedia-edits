Soon after in 1623, the Governor dictated that all men in the Virginia Militia must drill every month on their county court house green.  He also appointed officers to lead the Militia for the first time.  By 1676, the Virginia Militia had responded to numerous Indian raids and had served in Bacon's Rebellion.\n\nAs the 18th century evolved into a near continuous war between the British and French Empires, and due to wars with Indian tribes and French incursions to the west of the colony, The [[Virginia Regiment]] was formed by [[Governor Dinwiddie]] in 1754 out of the Virginia Militia.   It was the first all professional colonial regiment ever raised in the New World and thus given status of a regular British Army regiment during the [[Seven Years' War]].  Its officers were often unpaid volunteers and they would provide a corps to serve as Aides de Camp to the Commanding Generals of the British Army as well as fighting forces.  Colonel [[Joshua Fry]] was selected as the first commander and [[George Washington]] as its Lt. Colonel.  Washington became its Colonel in 1755 and established the command at Winchester, Virginia.  The regiment was a hybrid and included soldiers of \"foote, rangers and mounted\" and fought in the southern battles of the French and Indian War.  Its colors were retired in 1758 and members were returned to the Virginia Militia\nAs the revolutionary spirit spread across the new nation, the [[House of Burgesses]] reconstituted the Virginia Regiment and expanded it dramatically.  Further, it was determined that the standard Militia unit needed to institutionalize separate mounted troops.  In 1776, the State reorganized the Virginia Regiment into ten regiments of infantry called \"The [[Virginia Line]]\", and organized the first mounted infantry unit called the Virginia Light Horse Regiment.  Colonel Bland, a Virginia Militia officer was tasked to form, out of the Militia, this mounted regiment. In turn, it was commanded by Lt Colonel [[Henry Lee III]] or \"Light Horse Harry\", father of General [[Robert E. Lee]] of the Union and Confederate Armies.\n\nIn the summer of 1776, Bland and Lee organized The Virginia Light Horse regiment.  This unit was predominantly led by the aristocracy of Virginia and made up of the wealthy planters and merchants sons.  The Virginia Light Horse was by November of that year brought into Continental Army service and was re-designated the [[1st Continental Light Dragoons]].  Troops 1 & 2 were stood up outside of Boston, troops 3 & 4 were stood up in Pennsylvania, and 5th & 6th troops were assigned to the Virginia Regiment/Line as it assumed Federal military duties.  Henry Lee, a Virginia militia Captain, was commissioned by Congress in 1776 to form 5th Troop.  5th Troop took over 6th Troop and evolved over the years into Lee's Legion and later into the 2nd Partisan Corps; it was the primary cavalry force in the Southern Campaign and was on active duty until its colors were retired in 1783, again at Winchester, Virginia.\n\nIn 1846, the main county units mustered for service in the Mexican War, but the requirements on the Virginia Regiment did not have them actually deploy west and they were sent back to their homes and colors cased again in 1848.  These units formed the nucleus of the Virginia Divisions of the Confederacy in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]; and though little activity took place during the reconstruction period, the Virginia troops again mustered for service in the Spanish\u2013American War.  These troops were incorporated in the 2nd U.S. Virginia Volunteer Cavalry and Infantry in 1898/99, but were not deployed and stood down in 1901, except the Fourth Virginia Infantry, Fourth Regiment Volunteers (Norfolk, mustered May 20, 1898) sent from the United States for service in Cuba.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the Virginia State Volunteers (later renamed the Virginia Volunteers) were organized as a state defense force to support civil authorities from 1917 to 1921. The group guarded bridges, waterways, fuel storage areas, and public buildings and facilities during the war years, armed with surplus weapons dating back to 1876.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vdf.virginia.gov/vsdfhistory.html |title=History - A Proud Heritage |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=The Virginia State Guard Official Website |publisher= |accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref> \n\nDue to the possibility of imminent American involvement in [[World War II]], Governor Price ordered the establishment of the Virginia Protective Force on January 2, 1941.

Soon after in 1623, the Governor dictated that all men in the Virginia Militia must drill every month on their county court house green.  He also appointed officers to lead the Militia for the first time.  By 1676, the Virginia Militia had responded to numerous Indian raids and had served in Bacon's Rebellion.\n\nAs the 18th century evolved into a near continuous war between the British and French Empires, and due to wars with Indian tribes and French incursions to the west of the colony, The [[Virginia Regiment]] was formed by [[Governor Dinwiddie]] in 1754 out of the Virginia Militia.   It was the first all professional colonial regiment ever raised in the New World and thus given status of a regular British Army regiment during the [[Seven Years' War]].  Its officers were often unpaid volunteers and they would provide a corps to serve as Aides de Camp to the Commanding Generals of the British Army as well as fighting forces.  Colonel [[Joshua Fry]] was selected as the first commander and [[George Washington]] as its Lt. Colonel.  Washington became its Colonel in 1755 and established the command at Winchester, Virginia.  The regiment was a hybrid and included soldiers of \"foote, rangers and mounted\" and fought in the southern battles of the French and Indian War.  Its colors were retired in 1758 and members were returned to the Virginia Militia\nAs the revolutionary spirit spread across the new nation, the [[House of Burgesses]] reconstituted the Virginia Regiment and expanded it dramatically.  Further, it was determined that the standard Militia unit needed to institutionalize separate mounted troops.  In 1776, the State reorganized the Virginia Regiment into ten regiments of infantry called \"The [[Virginia Line]]\", and organized the first mounted infantry unit called the Virginia Light Horse Regiment.  Colonel Bland, a Virginia Militia officer was tasked to form, out of the Militia, this mounted regiment. In turn, it was commanded by Lt Colonel [[Henry Lee III]] or \"Light Horse Harry\", father of General [[Robert E. Lee]] of the Union and Confederate Armies.\n\nIn the summer of 1776, Bland and Lee organized The Virginia Light Horse regiment.  This unit was predominantly led by the aristocracy of Virginia and made up of the wealthy planters and merchants sons.  The Virginia Light Horse was by November of that year brought into Continental Army service and was re-designated the [[1st Continental Light Dragoons]].  Troops 1 & 2 were stood up outside of Boston, troops 3 & 4 were stood up in Pennsylvania, and 5th & 6th troops were assigned to the Virginia Regiment/Line as it assumed Federal military duties.  Henry Lee, a Virginia militia Captain, was commissioned by Congress in 1776 to form 5th Troop.  5th Troop took over 6th Troop and evolved over the years into Lee's Legion and later into the 2nd Partisan Corps; it was the primary cavalry force in the Southern Campaign and was on active duty until its colors were retired in 1783, again at Winchester, Virginia.\n\nIn 1846, the main county units mustered for service in the Mexican War, but the requirements on the Virginia Regiment did not have them actually deploy west and they were sent back to their homes and colors cased again in 1848.  These units formed the nucleus of the Virginia Divisions of the Confederacy in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]; and though little activity took place during the reconstruction period, the Virginia troops again mustered for service in the Spanish\u2013American War.  These troops were incorporated in the 2nd U.S. Virginia Volunteer Cavalry and Infantry in 1898/99, but were not deployed and stood down in 1901, except the Fourth Virginia Infantry, Fourth Regiment Volunteers (Norfolk, mustered May 20, 1898) sent from the United States for service in Cuba.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the Virginia State Volunteers (later renamed the Virginia Volunteers) were organized as a state defense force to support civil authorities from 1917 to 1921. The group guarded bridges, waterways, fuel storage areas, and public buildings and facilities during the war years, armed with surplus weapons dating back to 1876.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vdf.virginia.gov/vsdfhistory.html |title=History - A Proud Heritage |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=The Virginia State Guard Official Website |publisher= |accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref> \n\nDue to the possibility of imminent American involvement in [[World War II]], Governor Price ordered the establishment of the Virginia Protective Force on January 2, 1941.

Moore presented the band with several options, including [[Butch Vig]] and John Agnello, but the band selected Norton as they wanted someone who would be \"a bit pushy\". After a conversation between Moore and Norton, the producer rearranged his schedule to accommodate the band, as he liked the demo recordings he was sent. Violent Soho worked with Norton for five weeks at the Rockfield complex, where the band lived in an on-site apartment for the entire duration of recording, and Boerdam described the experience following their return to Brisbane afterwards:\n\n<blockquote>\nWe all got to stay together in the same spot for five weeks.

It was in the middle of the countryside, really quiet, 30 minutes walk from the nearest town. So really we got to focus on just doing the album, putting the songs to rest ...

Regarding the sound of the album, Boerdam asserted in an October 2013 interview: \"There's no reason to lock the band down to that grunge label which we were constantly given, despite us never using that word. We realised that we didn't care, as long as we were happy with the music we were making.\"<ref name=\"Craig\" />\n\nA video for the song \"In The Aisle\" was released on 16 July 2013. Directed by Tristan Houghton, the video documents a nude cyclist riding around Brisbane distributing flyers for an actual nude bike ride event. Tidswell and Boerdam explained in August 2013 that the video features Brisbane musician and local nudist activist Dario Western, who received nationwide attention for his nudist event through morning television programs. Dario was involved with the filming of the \"Neighbour Neighbour\" music video, but he did not appear in the final version, so the band asked him to appear as the sole actor in \"In The Aisle\".

As Boerdam explained in a September 2013 online article, \"From memory the term went something like this: 'We sit around on couches, buying what we think makes us who we are, like a hungry ghost'. I looked up [[hungry ghost]] and it actually comes from traditional Chinese Buddhism. It means to have a non-shakable addiction/desire, and you lose yourself to that desire, you lose your identity.\" Regarding the general themes of the album's lyrics, Boerdam said: \"Throughout the record I play with the idea of escaping a masked reality. I like to explore this concept that we live in a form of hyper-consumer reality and we lack an authentic human experience. In a few songs I try and focus on outsider suburban characters that are usually hidden and outcast by society, reenacting tapping into their reality and what they view as normal\".<ref name=\"Hungry Ghost\"/>\n\n''Hungry Ghost'' was identified by the ''Faster Louder'' online publication as the fourth-best album of 2013.

Consisting of songs written by Boerdam at 14 years of age, the recording was funded by the sale of Tidswell's car.

Moore presented the band with several options, including [[Butch Vig]] and John Agnello, but the band selected Norton as they wanted someone who would be \"a bit pushy\". After a conversation between Moore and Norton, the producer rearranged his schedule to accommodate the band, as he liked the demo recordings he was sent. Violent Soho worked with Norton for five weeks at the Rockfield complex, where the band lived in an on-site apartment for the entire duration of recording, and Boerdam described the experience following their return to Brisbane afterwards:\n\n<blockquote>\nWe all got to stay together in the same spot for five weeks. I think that was great for the band. It wasn\u2019t like tour, where everyday you\u2019re going somewhere, you\u2019re worried about how you\u2019re going to pay for petrol. It was the opposite. It was in the middle of the countryside, really quiet, 30 minutes walk from the nearest town. So really we got to focus on just doing the album, putting the songs to rest ... Gil [Norton] has the whole Lovetone [analog] pedal range. They\u2019re pedals from the UK that aren\u2019t made anymore \u2026 I spent hours with them, experimenting with sounds.

Regarding the sound of the album, Boerdam asserted in an October 2013 interview: \"There's no reason to lock the band down to that grunge label which we were constantly given, despite us never using that word. We realised that we didn't care, as long as we were happy with the music we were making.\"<ref name=\"Craig\" />\n\nA video for the song \"In The Aisle\" was released on 16 July 2013. Directed by Tristan Houghton, the video documents a nude cyclist riding around Brisbane distributing flyers for an actual nude bike ride event. Tidswell and Boerdam explained in August 2013 that the video features Brisbane musician and local nudist activist Dario Western, who received nationwide attention for his nudist event through morning television programs. Dario was involved with the filming of the \"Neighbour Neighbour\" music video, but he did not appear in the final version, so the band asked him to appear as the sole actor in \"In The Aisle\".

As Boerdam explained in a September 2013 online article, \"From memory the term went something like this: 'We sit around on couches, buying what we think makes us who we are, like a hungry ghost'. I looked up [[hungry ghost]] and it actually comes from traditional Chinese Buddhism. It means to have a non-shakable addiction/desire, and you lose yourself to that desire, you lose your identity.\" Regarding the general themes of the album's lyrics, Boerdam said: \"Throughout the record I play with the idea of escaping a masked reality. I like to explore this concept that we live in a form of hyper-consumer reality and we lack an authentic human experience. In a few songs I try and focus on outsider suburban characters that are usually hidden and outcast by society, reenacting tapping into their reality and what they view as normal\".<ref name=\"Hungry Ghost\"/>\n\n''Hungry Ghost'' was identified by the ''Faster Louder'' online publication as the fourth-best album of 2013.

Tidswell spoke about the concept of \"selling out\" as part of his contribution:\n\n<blockquote>\nPeople, you know, they put the big deal on, you know, \"selling out\" and that sort of thing, and, in all honesty, there is not much difference between taking money from, you know, some brand and some record label.

Its biggest improvement from its predecessor, the [[HM7B]] (which powers the [[ESC-A]]), is the capability of restarting up to five times. It is also the first European expander cycle engine, removing the need for a [[gas generator]] to drive the fuel and oxidizer pumps. The engine features a [[carbon ceramic]] [[expanding nozzle|extendable nozzle]] in order to have a large, 2.15&nbsp;m diameter nozzle extension with minimum length: the retracted nozzle part is deployed only after the upper stage separates from the rest of the rocket; after extension, the engine's overall length increases from 2.3&nbsp;m to 4.2&nbsp;m.\n\n==Development==\nAlthough the ESC-B development was put on hold in 2003, the Vinci project has not been cancelled: at a lower pace, the engine is still being developed. On 22 December 2006, Snecma announced a new ESA contract for Vinci rocket engine long-duration and re-ignition testing. \n\nIn late April 2010 the [[German Aerospace Center]] DLR announced the start of a six-month test campaign for the Vinci engine at its [[Lampoldshausen]] facility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-4836/8021_read-24037/|title=Vinci \u2013 tests on the high-thrust, cryogenic, restartable upper stage engine for Ariane 5 gather pace|publisher=[[German Aerospace Center]]|place=[[Lampoldshausen]]|date=28 April 2010|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> The first successful test firing of this campaign took place on 27 May 2010.<ref>{{Cite press release|url=http://www.safran-aircraft-engines.com/media/first-test-vincir-m3-engine-success-20100604|title=First test of Vinci M3 engine a success!|publisher=[[Safran Aircraft Engines]]|place=[[\u00c9vry, Essonne|Evry]]|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> A video of a test was released in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2016/05/Ariane_6_Vinci_engine_is_tested|title=Ariane 6 Vinci engine is tested|date=2016-05-17|access-date=2017-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[NASA]] was interested with the idea of using the Vinci instead of the [[RL10]] for an upper stage of [[Space Launch System]].
