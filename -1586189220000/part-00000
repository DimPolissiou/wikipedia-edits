Windsurfing had a larger global media presence than Surfing during these years. This popularity attracted significant sponsorship deals which in turn further promoted the sport with extensive paid advertising.\n\nMany of the world's top riders like Robby Naish, became wealthy and very famous athletes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ispo.com/en/people/id_79694866/surf-star-robby-naish-water-sports-business-has-changed-.html|title=Surf Star Robby Naish: \"Water Sports Business Has Changed\"|website=Ispo.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/23/sport/robby-naish-windsurfing-hawaii-spt/index.html|title=How Robby Naish conquered the waves|author1=Danielle Rossingh |author2=Shirley Robertson|website=CNN}}</ref>\n\nWindsurfing's popularity across global media saw a decline toward the end of the 1990s. This has been attributed to many possible problems within the sport including licensing battles, equipment becoming too specialized, requiring excessive expertise, the splintering of Windsurfing into various niche groups around the world and splintering of the fundamentals as constant reinvention of technology challenged what it was to be 'a windsurfer'. On top of these internal issues there was a coinciding drop in major sponsor support, directly caused by the steady introduction of international bans on cigarette advertising during the 1990s. Cigarette industry advertising had become the dominant source of sponsorship support during the early and mid 1990s boom years for the professional level of windsurfing. With the internationally legislated withdrawal of these large companies, the money spent on promoting the sport and paying for add space declined steeply and Windsurfing receded from public view across global advertising and media generally.\n\nAfter some lean years in the early 2000s, the sport has seen a steady revival. New beginner-friendly designs have become available and new corporate sponsors have emerged to once again invest in advertising and promoting the sport to align corporate values and interests for marketing.\n\nThe sport of Windsurfing is one of constant re-invention, innovation and of pioneers in water sports generally. With the advent of [[kitesurfing]], created by windsurfers, many avid windsurfers took up the similar sport for some variety after many years on the traditional windsurfer style equipment. More recently 'foiling' has become a major new interest among many windsurfers. As of 2019, longer, wider boards that are easier to sail are coming back and engaging a new generation. The sense of what it is to be 'a Windsurfer' or 'a surfer' is also changing as watermen like Kai Lenny break down barriers.\n\n===The Inventors===\n[[File:Windsurfpatent.jpg|left|thumb|Illustration from US Patent 3,487,800, filed by inventors Jim Drake and Hoyle Schweitzer on March 27, 1968]]\n\n[[File:Darby sailboard, Published Popular Science, August 1965.gif|thumbnail|Darby sailboard, Popular Science, 1965]]\n\nWindsurfing, as a sport and recreational activity, did not emerge until the latter half of the 20th century. Long before this modern moment, there were small scale sailing craft that have used wind as the driving force, many of them sourced to the [[Polynesia]]ns who have been riding the wind and waves for centuries. Early accounts suggest island peoples were undertaking day trips over oceans standing upright on a solid board with a vertical sail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofwindsurfing.net/en/press-lounge/basics/legends-of-the-sport/jim-drake.html|title=Jim Drake \u2013 Inventor of windsurfing|publisher=World of Windsurfing|accessdate=}}</ref> In the early 19th Century, people in logging communities around western [[Lake Michigan]] were purportedly fixing sails to logs as part of log float control and for recreation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deepcraft.org/deep/archives/2785|title=The Legend of Lumberjack Surfing|publisher=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, 20-year-old '''Newman Darby''' was the first to conceive the idea of using a handheld sail and rig mounted on a [[universal joint]] so that he could control his small [[catamaran]]\u2014the first rudderless sailboard ever built that allowed a person to steer by shifting his or her weight in order to tilt the sail [[Bow (ship)|fore]] and [[aft]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Chronological Order of the Development of the Free Sail System Sailboard|publisher=The Hart's Homepage|url=http://windsurf.mediaforte.com/darby/timeline.html}}</ref> Darby did not file a patent for the sailboard.

On later reflection, Drake didn't like the integrity of the idea and dismissed it. There were already a number of sailboard designs available, and Drake also was concerned about the integrity of a design needing taut wire close to a human body to keep the sail upright.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>\n\nDrake mentioned the idea to [[surfing|surfer]] '''Hoyle Schweitzer''' who wanted to develop it, but Drake was still unsure of how to control and steer what he envisaged in a design concept as a surfboard with upright sail design, whereby the sailor stood upright on the board holding the sail.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>\n\nThe technical problem was that most boats steer by varying the angle of attack in the water between the [[centreboard|centerboard]] and the [[rudder]], and Drake's question came down to simple operation of how a standing person could control both the power of the sail as well as the direction of the craft.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>\n\nIn 1967, Drake reflected on early 17th century based sail ship control. Rudders then were weak and ineffective, mostly used for trimming course. Hence with multi-masted boats, the sailors would trim the upper sails on the forward and rearwards masts to steer the ship.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>\n\nDismissing the idea of a design with two upright sails, Drake decided to move the sail by rotation, as moving it linearly would require a mechanical system. Experimenting with a rotational design which became the concept for the [[universal joint]], whereby the angle of attack of the sail to the board could be varied to allow control of both power and direction. Drake finished the design by using an earlier, but for them, failed invention of East Coast racing sail, and added a [[Boom (windsurfing)|wishbone boom]].<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/> It is widely agreed that the 1960s, [[Jim Drake (engineer)|Jim Drake]] was the first to solve many problems of getting the board to sail. Drake passed away 2012 leaving behind a great and lasting contribution to the sport that he loved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/business/jim-drake-creator-of-the-windsurfer-dies-at-83.html|title=Jim Drake, Creator of the Windsurfer, Dies at 83|first=Daniel E.|last=Slotnik|date=July 3, 2012|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe sport had more than one early pioneer but it was '''Hoyle Schweitzer''', the savvy Californian surfer, who was the first to be successful in marketing the sailboard and creating a modern global sport from a grass roots group of innovators.<ref name=\"Windsurfing\"/> With Drake, he founded '''Windsurfing International''' and went on to build an empire around a sport that he brought to the world stage. Were it not for Schweitzer's personal drive and ambition, the world would not know windsurfing as a major global sport.\n\n===Windsurfing International===\nOn March 27, 1968, Hoyle Schweitzer (a surfer) and Jim Drake (a sailor) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/windsurfing|title=Windsurfing &#124; sport|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> filed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3487800.pdf|title=WIND-PROPELLED APPARATUS|website=www.freepatentsonline.com|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}</ref> the very first windsurfing patent, which was granted by the USPTO in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/wstartinventions/a/windsurfing.htm |title=About.com: Inventors \u2013 History of Windsurfing |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> This combination of a surfer (rider) and a sailor (racer) would go on to define the sport in more ways than they could possibly imagine at the time.\n\nThe early windsurfing boards were made of foam in the garages of Schweitzer and Drake, with the booms, tees and daggerboards handcrafted in [[teak]]. Hoyle sub-contracted the manufacture of the teak items to boat builder Ennals Ives in [[Taiwan]], but the quality and costs of transportation brought other issues.<ref name=\"AMWindMag2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.windsurfing-academy.com/information_bank/history/interview_with_hoyle_schweitzer.asp|title=Origins of windsurfing: Hoyle Schweitzer|publisher=American Windsurfer Magazine|date=|accessdate=}}</ref> One of the early customers was Bert Salisbury, and the first international shipment of a container of boards went to [[Sweden]].<ref name=\"AMWindMag2\"/> Early customers also included [[Lufthansa]] pilots who had read about the board, who simply included one as personal luggage on their return journey from [[Los Angeles International Airport]].<ref name=\"AMWindMag2\"/>\n\nTo ensure the quality of the product and handle marketing, in 1968 Hoyle and Diana Schweitzer founded the company Windsurfing International<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/product-compint-0000618644-page.html|title=Find Local Contractors - Home Remodeling Contractors on Ecnext|website=goliath.ecnext.com|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}</ref> in Southern California to manufacture, promote, and license a windsurfer design. The jointly owned patent was wholly licensed to Windsurfing International.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/> Working in a factory unit in [[Torrance, California]], Hoyle, who had previously built personal [[surfboard]]s in his garage, was unhappy with the durability of the early \"Baja Board.\" He therefore developed a new mould, based on an old [[Malibu surfboard]] design that Matt Kivlin had developed, which the company sub-contracted for mass manufacture to Elmer Good.<ref name=\"AMWindMag2\"/>\n\nThe company registered the term \"windsurfer\" as a trademark at the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] in 1973, launching the craft as a [[one-design]] class. Going [[one-design]] was influenced by the success of the [[Laser (dinghy)|Laser]] and [[Hobie Cat]] classes. Each Windsurfer had an identical computer-cut sail, a technology new at that time and pioneered by Ian Bruce and the Laser class.\n\nIn 1968, Hoyle offered Drake a buy out of his half of the patent, and it was only when Hoyle pointed out ownership of the company that the relationship between the pair began to fall apart. Having returned to California, in 1973 Drake sold his half of the patent to Windsurfing International for the sum of $36,000.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>\n\nThe equipment consists of a board usually {{convert|2|to|2.5|m}} long, with displacements typically between {{convert|45|and|150|l}}, powered by wind on a sail.  The rig is connected to the board by a [[Coupling#Elastic|free-rotating universal joint]] and consists of a [[mast (sailing)|mast]], [[boom (sailing)|boom]] and [[sail]]. On \u201cshort\u201d boards The sail area generally ranges from {{convert|1.5|to|12|m2}} depending on the conditions, the skill of the sailor, the type of windsurfing being undertaken and the weight of the person windsurfing. On long boards, upon which the sport was first popularized -sail areas and board lengths are typically larger and the athleticism required is much less.\n\n====Patents====\nThrough the seventies, Schweitzer aggressively promoted and licensed the Windsurfing International design and licensed the patent to manufacturers worldwide, mainly through competition and the publication of a magazine.<ref name=\"AMWindMag2\"/> As a result, the sport underwent very rapid growth, particularly in Europe after the sale of a sub-license sold to Ten Cate Sports in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/> In 1975 Ten Cate Sports sold 45,000 boards in Europe.\n\nAt the same time, Schweitzer also sought to defend his patent rights vigorously against unauthorized manufacturers. This led to a host of predating windsurfer-like devices being presented to courts around the world by companies disputing Windsurfing International's rights to the invention.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/rpc/article/102/4/59/1591300|title=WINDSURFING INTERNATIONAL INC. v.

This board used a universal joint, one of the key parts of the Windsurfing International's patent. They also found stories published about the 1948 invention of the sailboard by [[Newman Darby]] and his wife Naomi in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"oregon.com\"/>\n\nIn ''Windsurfing International Inc. v Tabur Marine (GB) Ltd. 1985 RPC 59''<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20031211083750/http://slcc.strath.ac.uk/scotslawcourse/ip/ip/patent/windsurf.html</ref> with Tabur backed financially by French sailing fan [[Baron Marcel Bich]], British courts recognized the prior art of Peter Chilvers. It did not incorporate the curved wishbone booms of the modern windsurfer, but rather a \"straight boom\" that became curved in use. The courts found that the Schweitzer windsurfer boom was \"merely an obvious extension\". This court case set a precedent for [[patent law]] in the United Kingdom, in terms of [[inventive step and non-obviousness]]; the court upheld the defendant's claim that the Schweitzer patent was invalid, based on film footage of Chilvers. Schweitzer then sued the company in Canada, where the opposition team again financially backed by Bic included Chilvers and Jim Drake, and Schweitzer lost again. After the cases, no longer obliged to pay Windsurfing International any royalty payments, the now renamed Bic Sport became one of the world's larger producers of windsurfing equipment, with an annual production of 15,000 boards.<ref name=\"BicSportHist\"/>\n\nThere is no evidence that Schweitzer or Drake had knowledge of any prior inventions similar to theirs. Drake accepted in retrospect that, although he can be credited with the invention, he was \"probably no better than third,\" behind mid-west based [[Newman Darby]] and [[England|Englishman]] [[Peter Chilvers]].<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/> The battle over the origin story of the sport would go on to cause much legal grief for the global sporting phenomenon for much of the 1980s.\n\nIn 1983, Schweitzer sued.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/> Swiss board manufacturer Mistral<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mistral.com|title=Mistral waterlife and living since 1976|website=Mistral|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}</ref> and lost. Mistral's defense hinged on the work of US inventor [[Newman Darby]], who by 1965 conceived the \"sailboard\": a hand-held square rigged \"kite\" sail on a floating platform for recreational use.<ref name=\"oregon.com\"/>\n\nEventually US courts recognized the Schweitzer windsurfer as an obvious step from Darby's prior art.<ref>{{cite web |first=Laura |last=Zelasnic |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/d8625.htm |title=Technology, invention, and innovation collections |publisher=Americanhistory.si.edu |accessdate=2011-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702191042/http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/d8625.htm |archivedate=July 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Schweitzer had to reapply for a patent under severely limited terms, and finally it expired in 1987. Shortly thereafter, having lost its license royalty income, Windsurfing International ceased operations.<ref name=\"AMWindMag2\"/>\n\nIn 1984, Australian courts determined a patent case:  Windsurfing International Inc & Anor -v- Petit & Anor<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/103902464/Windsurfing-v-Petit-Judgment-28-Jun-84|title=Windsurfing v Petit - Judgment 28-Jun-84 - Rotation - Patent Infringement|website=Scribd|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}</ref> (also part reported in 3 IPR 449 or [1984] 2 NSWLR 196), which attributed the first legally accepted use of a split boom to an Australian boy, Richard Eastaugh. Between the ages of ten and thirteen, from 1946 to 1949, aided by his younger brothers, he built around 20 galvanized iron canoes and hill trolleys which he equipped with sails with split bamboo booms. He sailed these in a sitting position and not as a windsurfer standing up, near his home on the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. The judge noted that, ''\"Mr Eastaugh greatly exaggerated the capacity of his galvanised iron canoes to sail to windward\"'' and that, ''\"There is no corroboration of Mr Eastaugh's experiences by any other witness. Neither of his brothers or his father was called\"''.<ref>see pages 104\u2013105 of judgment cited</ref>\n\nIt is acknowledged in the courts that the separate Eastaugh (1946\u20131949), Darby (1965) and Chilvers (1958) inventions pre-dated the Schweitzer/Drake patent (1968).<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>\n\nBy the late 1980s the sport was massive and in the midst of a full blown marketing and legal battle between the original market in the US, and the exploding European markets.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> This epic legal battle laid the ground for a still running rivalry between the European and American hemispheres.\n\n====Trademarks====\nWindsurfing International claimed trademark rights with respect to the word \"windsurfer\". While this was registered in the United States for some years, it was not accepted for registration in many jurisdictions as the word was considered too descriptive. Registration was ultimately lost in the United States for the same reason.\n\nThe Schweitzers initially chose the word for its descriptive quality. Unfortunately they immediately set out diminishing its value by naming their company \"Windsurfing International\" and even referring to themselves and their own children as \"windsurfers\". History would reveal that this nomenclature from Schweitzer did indeed become the universally accepted way of describing the sport, the participants, and the equivalent.\n\nAs the word was rejected as legally registrable for patent purposes in a number of countries, lawyers advised that to be successful the word would have to be used as a [[proper adjective]]. They realised that this required a number of generic nouns to which the adjective would apply: sailboard, boardsailing, planche a voile, segelbrett and so on. The rearguard action was ultimately unsuccessful and arguably created considerable confusion which hampered marketing efforts in later years.  Today the word windsurfer is completely dominant around the world. Schweitzer's vision of the sport is complete and now fulfilled, despite an agony process that he and his company had to endure.\n\n====Marketing====\nThe numerous patent and trademark disputes disrupted the sport during the 1980s and into the early 1990s. These disputes did not occur until well after Windsurfing International, its licensees, class associations, retailers, schools and owners had built the sport to a successful commercial basis. That success brought imitation and then the legal disputes described above.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/19820201/2262.html|title=Hoyle Schweitzer's Decade Of Discontent|first=Robert A.|last=Mamis|date=February 1, 1982|website=Inc.com}}</ref>\n\nThe launch phase with 'Windsurfing International' saw a comprehensive development of infrastructure for a new sport and dramatic sales growth. The foundation of the sport was laid down in this way by Windsurfing International and this extraordinarily clear vision has provided the sport with its powerful and demonstrated endurance.\n\nDarby is now largely recognised as the 'original inventor', while the massive growth of the sport is largely attributed to Schweitzer with his elegant refinement of the craft from a surfing background and his savvy business investment strategy. The sport of Windsurfing now honours both these individuals as the founders of the modern sport.\n\n==Equipment==\nWindsurfers are often classified as either '''shortboards''' or '''longboards'''. Longboards are usually longer than 3 meters, with a retractable [[daggerboard]], and were optimized for lighter winds or course racing. Shortboards were less than 3 meters long and were designed for [[Planing (sailing)|planing]] conditions.\n\nWhile windsurfing is possible under a wide range of wind conditions, most intermediate and advanced recreational windsurfers prefer to sail in conditions that allow for consistent planing with multi-purpose, not overly specialized, free-ride equipment. Larger (100 to 140 liters) free-ride boards are capable of planing at wind speeds as low as {{convert|12|kn|m/s|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} if rigged with an adequate, well-tuned sail in the six to eight square meter range. The pursuit of planing in lower winds has driven the popularity of wider and shorter boards, with which planing is possible in wind as low as {{convert|8|kn|m/s|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, if sails in the 10 to 12 square meter range are used.\n\nModern windsurfing boards can be classified into many categories:\nThe original ''Windsurfer'' board had a body made out of [[polyethylene]] filled with [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] foam. Later, hollow [[glass-reinforced plastic|glass-reinforced epoxy]] designs were used. Most boards produced today have an [[expanded polystyrene]] foam core reinforced with a composite sandwich shell, that can include [[carbon fiber]], [[kevlar]], or [[fiberglass]] in a matrix of [[epoxy]] and sometimes [[plywood]] and [[thermoplastic]]s. Racing and wave boards are usually very light (5 to 7&nbsp;kg), and are made out of carbon sandwich. Such boards are very stiff, and veneer is sometimes used to make them more shock-resistant. Boards aimed at the beginners are heavier (8 to 15&nbsp;kg) and more robust, containing more fiberglass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boardlady.com/anatomy.htm |title=Anatomy of an Epoxy Sandwich board |first=Eva-M. |last=Hollman |publisher=The Board Lady |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n*'''Beginner boards''': (Sometimes called funboards) these often have a [[daggerboard]], are almost as wide as Formula boards, and have plenty of volume, hence stability.\n*'''Freeride''': Boards meant for comfortable recreational cruising (mostly straight-line sailing and occasional turning) at planing speed (aka blasting), mainly in flat waters or in light to moderate swell. They typically fall into the volume range of 90 to 170 liters. The so-called freeride sailing movement diverged from course racing as more recreational sailors chose to sail freely without being constrained to sailing on courses around buoys.\n*'''Racing longboards''': [[Mistral One Design]], or the Olympic RS:X class race boards.\n*'''[[Formula Windsurfing]] Class''': Shorter boards up to one meter in width, for use in Formula Windsurfing races. See [[#Formula class|below]] for a more detailed description.[[File:Windsurf.600pix.jpg|right|thumb|Windsurfing in the late evening on a longboard at [[Sandbanks]] in the 1980s ([[Poole Harbour]], England).]]\n*'''Slalom boards''': In the past, the key feature of slalom boards was merely speed, but it has been proven that maneuverability and ease of use are as important as speed in order to get you around the slalom course faster, and therefore modern slalom boards are shortboards aimed at top speed, maneuverability and ease of use. \n*'''Speed boards''': In essence an extremely narrow and sleek slalom board, built for top speed only.\n*'''Freestyle boards''': Related to wave boards in terms of maneuverability, these are wider, higher volume boards geared specifically at performing acrobatic tricks (jumps, rotations, slides, flips and loops) on flat water. Usually 80 to 110 liters in volume, and about 203 to 230 centimeters in length, with widths frequently in excess of 60 centimeters. Freestyle boards began to diverge more noticeably in design from wave boards in the early part of the 2000 decade, as aerial tricks (the Vulcan, Spock, Grubby, Flaka, and related '''New School''' maneuvers, almost all involving a jump-and-spin component) became the predominant part of the freestyle repertoire, superseding '''Old School''' moves, in which the board did not leave contact with the water.\n*'''Wave boards''': Smaller, lighter, more maneuverable boards for use in breaking waves. Characteristically, sailors on wave boards perform high jumps while sailing against waves, and they ride the face of a wave performing narrow linked turns (bottom turns, cutbacks, and top-turns) in a similar way to [[surfing]]. Wave boards usually have a volume between 65 and 105 liters, with a length between 215 and 235 centimeters, and 50 to 60 centimeters in width. A general rule is for a sailor to use a wave board whose volume in liters is about the same as the sailor's weight in kilograms \u2013 more volume providing additional flotation for sailing in light winds, and less for high winds, where less volume is needed to achieve planing. In recent years, the average width of wave boards has increased slightly, as the length has shrunk, while the range of volume has been maintained the same more or less\u2014according to board designers this makes wave boards easier to use under a wider range of conditions by sailors of differing abilities. The most common sizes of sails used with wave boards are in the range of 3.4 to 6.0 square meters, depending on the wind speed and the weight of the sailor.\n\n'''Sails'''\n{{main|Sail}}\n\nModern windsurfing [[sail]]<nowiki/>s are often made of monofilm (clear polyester film), dacron (woven [[polyester]]) and [[mylar]]. Areas under high load may be reinforced with [[kevlar]].\n\nTwo designs of a sail are predominant: [[camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] induced and rotational. Cambered sails have 1\u20135 camber inducers - plastic devices at the ends of [[Sail batten|batten]]s which cup against the mast. They help create a rigid [[aerofoil]] shape for faster speed and stability, but at the cost of maneuverability and how light the sail feels. The trend is that racier sails have camber inducers while wave sails and most recreational sails do not. The rigidity of the sail is also determined by a number of ''battens''.\n\nBeginners' sails often do not have ''battens'', so they are lighter and easier to use in light winds. However, as the sailor improves, a battened sail will provide greater stability in stronger winds.\n\nRotational sails have ''battens'' which protrude beyond the back aspect of the mast. They flip or \"rotate\" to the other side of the mast when tacking or jibing, hence the rotation in the name. Rotational sails have an aerofoil shape on the [[leeward]] side when powered, but are nearly flat when sheeted out (unpowered). In comparison with cambered sails, rotational designs offer less power and stability when sailing straight, but are easier to handle when maneuvering. Rotational sails are usually lighter and easier to rig.\n\nA windsurfing sail is tensioned at two points: at the tack (by [[downhaul]]), and at the clew (by [[outhaul]]). There is a set of [[pulley]]s for downhauling at the tack, and a [[grommet]] at the [[clew]]. Most shape is given to the sail by applying a very strong downhaul, which by design bends the mast. The outhaul tension is relatively weak, mostly providing leverage for controlling the sail's angle of attack.\n\nThe sail is tuned by adjusting the downhaul and the outhaul tension. Generally, a sail is trimmed more (flatter shape) for stronger winds. More downhaul tension loosens the upper part of the leech, allowing the top of the sail to twist and \"spill\" wind during gusts, shifting the center of effort (strictly, the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]]) down. Releasing downhaul tension shifts the center of effort up. More outhaul lowers the camber/draft, making the sail flatter and easier to control, but less powerful; less outhaul results in more draft, providing more low-end power, but usually limiting speed by increasing aerodynamic resistance.\n\nThe disciplines of windsurfing (wave, freestyle, freeride) require different sails. Wave sails are reinforced to survive the surf, and are nearly flat when depowered to allow riding waves. Freestyle sails are also flat when depowered, and have high low-end power to allow quick acceleration. Freeride sails are all-rounders that are comfortable to use and are meant for recreational windsurfing. Race sails provide speed at the expense of qualities like comfort or maneuverability.\n\nThe size of the sail is measured in square meters and can be from 3&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> to 5.5&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> for wave sails and 6&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> to 15&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> for race sails, with ranges for freestyle and freeride sails spanning somewhere between these extremes. Learning sails for children can be as small as 0.7&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> and race sails up to 15&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>.\n\n'''Associated Equipment'''\n*[[Mast (sailing)|Mast]]\n*[[Boom (windsurfing)|Boom]]\n*[[Fin]] (similar shape to a [[surfboard fin]] but is usually stronger for windsurfing)\n*Universal joint ([[Coupling#Elastic|elastic joints]] are more common, but some are [[Universal joint|mechanical]])\n*[[Windsurfing harness|Harness]] and Harness lines\n*[[Wet suit]]/[[Dry suit]]\n*[[Wetsuit boot|Footwear]]\n*[[Helmet]]\n*[[Personal flotation device]]\n*Travel Gear \u2013 Sail Bags, Board Bags, Car Racks\n*Safety gear: line, distress strobe light, whistle, [[Marine VHF radio]] <ref>''[http://www.sfba.org/index.php/safety/windsurfing-safety Windsurfing Safety] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808055429/http://www.sfba.org/index.php/safety/windsurfing-safety |date=August 8, 2014 }}'', San Francisco Boardsailing Association (SFBA)</ref>\n\n==Technique==\nA sailboard will move, depending on wind conditions and the skill or intentions of the rider, in two entirely different manners, with two different [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]]s; it will either sail or hydroplane (referred to as \"[[planing (sailing)|planing]]\"). A sensation likened to low-level flying may be experienced by the hydroplaning windsurfer.\n\n===Beginners===\nLearning to windsurf is now easy with the development of wider, high volume beginner boards. The transition time from beginner to intermediate is now 2\u20133 weeks of daily sailing. Beginners, start on a large board with a tiny triangular sail in light wind in an area of safe flat water.\n\n===Youth===\nWindsurfing is suitable for children as young as 5, with several board and sail brands producing \"Kids Rigs\" to accommodate these short and light weight windsurfers.  In some countries, organisations exist to provide entry into the sport in a semi-formal or club-style environment (i.e. The RYA's Team 15 scheme).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rya.org.uk/programmes/team15/Pages/default.aspx |title=Team 15 |publisher=\"RYA |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref> Robert (Robby) Naish took up the fledgling sport of windsurfing at the age of 11, and in 1976 won his first overall World Championship title at the age of 13.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Light Winds===\nThe board moves through the water \u2013 much like a sailing boat does \u2013 using an extendable centreboard (if available) and [[fin]] or [[skeg]] for stability and lateral resistance. The centreboard is retracted at broad [[points of sail]], again similarly to a sailing boat, to allow for jibing control. In these conditions windsurf boards also [[Tack (sailing)|tack]] and [[Jibe (sailing)|jibe]] like a sailing boat.\n\n'''Directional Control''' is achieved by moving the rig either forward (turning away from the wind) or aft (turning towards the wind). When jibing, the clew of the sail is let around and allowed to rotate out and around the mast.\n\n'''Fall Recovery'''. The rider climbs onto the board, grabs the pulling rope (''uphaul''), makes sure the mast foot is placed between his/her two feet, pulls the sail about one third out of the water, lets the wind turn the sail-board combination till he/she has the wind right in the back, pulls the sail all the way out, places the \"mast hand\" (hand closest to the mast) on the boom, pulls the mast over the center line of the board, places the \"sail hand\" (hand furthest from the mast) on the boom, then pulling on it to close the sail and power it.\n\n===Strong Winds===\n[[File:Sail Size Selection Table.png|right|thumb|Ideal sail size (m\u00b2) for different wind speeds and rider weights (recreational level). The red values indicate sail sizes that are unpractical or not available.]]\nIn planing conditions a harness is typically worn to more efficiently use the rider's weight to counter the force in the sail. As the wind increases, the rider continues to sheet the sail, the fin generates more lift, and the board gains speed, transitioning onto a ''plane''. The volume of board in the water (''displacement'') decreases, and the rider moves rearward, stepping into the footstraps for improved control. When planing, the board skims on the surface rather than displacing water as it moves. Planing can be achieved at different wind speeds depending on the rider's weight, sail and fin size, wave conditions, and rider ability. With modern equipment planing can normally be achieved at a wind speed of around {{convert|12|kn|m/s|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. The transition from displacement motion to planing requires a jump in energy, but once planing, water resistance decreases dramatically. This means that it is possible to continue to plane, although the wind has dropped below a level that would be required to transition to plane. A board in plane can be much smaller than a board moving by displacement (thereby gaining an advantage in gear weight and board control). Lateral resistance to the wind is provided by the fin alone (generating more lift at higher speeds) and a centreboard is no longer used (smaller boards do not have one). A fin generates lift, transferring a strong load to the board, and so is usually constructed of carbon fiber for accurate shape and strength. A low-pressure area develops on the windward side of the fin, which can lead to [[cavitation]], leading to a sudden loss of lift, called \"spin-out\" (equivalent to [[Stall (fluid dynamics)|\"stalling\"]] in flight terminology). Ideal planing conditions for most recreational riders is {{convert|15|-|25|kn|m/s|abbr=on|round=each}} of wind, but experts can windsurf in much windier conditions. Planing is considered one of the most exhilarating aspects of the sport.\n\n'''Steering''' is mainly achieved by putting rider weight pressure on either the left or the right rail (edge) of the board. Jibing is done at full speed (a so-called \"carve jibe\", \"power jibe\" or \"planing jibe\"), whereby the rider continues to apply pressure on the inside rail of the turn, leaning into the turn much like a [[snowboarder]] making a toe-side turn. Pressure is released from the sail as the board speed turns downwind, allowing for the sail to be jibed. Tacking is still possible, but at these conditions has become an advanced maneuver, because it requires quick movements and good balance. A heel-side turn while planing (called a \"cut-back\") is usually only executed in wave riding.\n\n'''Water-start''': In strong winds it is difficult to uphaul the sail (pulling it out of the water while standing on the board) so [[Waterstart|''waterstarting'']] is necessary. This is done (while [[water treading]]) by positioning the mast perpendicular to the wind, lifting the luff out of the water to allow the wind to catch the sail, and then having the sail pull the sailor onto the board. As the sail becomes powered, it is then trimmed to bring the rider, board, and sail back onto a plane. Occasionally a rider may be unable to waterstart if the wind has dropped. If this happens the rider can wait for a gust and \"''pump''\" the sail to get back on the board. If this becomes hopeless uphauling the sail will be necessary.\n\n==Racers==\n\n===Long-Board Classes===\n\n===Olympic class===\n{{main|Sailboarding at the Summer Olympics}}\n\nSailboarding has been one of the Olympic [[Sailing at the Olympics|sailing events]] at the [[Summer Olympics]] since 1984 for men and 1992 for women. Olympic Windsurfing uses 'One Design' boards, with all sailors using the same boards, [[daggerboard]]s, fins and sails. The equipment is chosen to allow racing in a wide range of sailing conditions. This is important for the [[Olympic Games]], as events have to take place regardless of whether there is enough wind for planing. The current Olympic class, the [[Neil Pryde RS:X]] was used for the first time in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. For 2024 the new Olympic Class windsurfer will use advanced foil technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surfertoday.com/windsurfing/ifoil-the-new-olympic-windsurfing-equipment|title=iQFoil: the new Olympic windsurfing equipment|first=|last=|website=Surfertoday}}</ref>\n\n===Formula class===\n{{main|Formula Windsurfing}}\n[[File:Bry.jpg|right|thumb|Formula racer in [[San Francisco Bay]].]]\n[[Formula Windsurfing|Formula windsurfing]] has developed over the last 15 years in order to facilitate high-performance competition in light and moderate winds. Formula is now a class of windsurfing boards controlled by the [[International Sailing Federation]] that has the principal characteristic of a maximum 1m width. They have a single [[fin]] of maximum length 70&nbsp;cm and carry sails up to 12.5 m\u00b2. Class rules allow sailors to choose boards produced by multiple manufacturers, as long as they are certified as Formula boards and registered with ISAF, and use fins and sails of different sizes. With the sail, fin and board choices, the equipment is able to be tailored to suit sailors of all body shapes and formula windsurfing presents one of the fastest course-racing sailing craft on the water. Formula Windsurfing is popular in many locations around the globe with predominantly light winds and flat water.\n\nLarge sails in combination with the 'wide-style' design allow planing in very low wind conditions as well as control and usability in high winds and bigger sea conditions. Non-planing sailing is very difficult with this design and racing is only conducted with a strict {{convert|7|kn|m/s|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} wind minimum in place. Formula boards are used on \"flat water\" as opposed to coastal surf, but racing is still held in windy conditions involving swell and chop. In 2008, a Formula Windsurfing Grand-Prix World Tour began, with events in Europe and South America complementing the single-event World Championships as a professional tour for the Formula class.\n\nFormula boards have excellent upwind and downwind ability, but are not as comfortable on a [[Points of sail#Beam reach|beam reach]] unless fin sizes are reduced. This explains why the course is usually a box with longer upwind and downwind legs, or just a simple upwind-downwind return course.\n\n===Raceboard Class===\nRaceboards are longer windsurf boards with a daggerboard and movable mast rail allowing the sailor to be efficient on all points of sail. Excellent upwind ability is combined with good reaching and even downwind ability typically sailed in an Olympic triangle course. Whilst in decline in manufacture since the advent of shortboard course racing (which evolved into Formula) there remains some models in production and most notably the [[Mistral One Design Class|IMCO]] One Design remains popular amongst amateur racing clubs.\n\n===Short-Board Classes===\n\n===Slalom===\nSlalom is a high-speed race. Typically there are two sorts of slalom courses.\n*Figure of eight: All of the course should on a beam reach with two floating marks that have to be [[Jibe (sailing)|jibe]]d around.\n*Downwind: More than two marks are laid and sailors sail a downwind course \u2013 gybing around each mark only once.\nSlalom boards are small and narrow, and require high winds. Funboard class racing rules require winds of {{convert|9|-|35|kn|m/s|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} for the slalom event to take place.\n\n===Ocean Slalom Marathon===\nThere are 3 major Ocean Slalom Marathons in the world: The Defi-Wind in France, The Lancelin Ocean Classic in Western Australia, and the Hatterass Marathon in the USA.\n\n===Super X===\nThis discipline is a cross between freestyle and slalom. Competitors race on a short downwind slalom course, must duck jibe on all turns, and are required to perform several tricks along the way. Competitors are required to wear protective equipment.  The Super X discipline was short lived and is now largely unpracticed; it reached its peak in the early 2000s,\n\n===Speedsailing===\nSpeedsailing takes place in several forms. The ISWC (International Speed Windsurfing Class) organizes (under the umbrella of the ISAF) competitions in various locations around the world known for conditions suitable for good speeds. The events are made up of heats sailed on a 500m course. The average of each sailor's best 2 speeds on the 500m course, which is typically open for 2 hours per heat, is their speed for that heat. As such it is possible for the sailor with the outright fastest time not to win the heat if his second best time pulls his average down. Points are given for the placings in the heats and the overall event winner is the sailor with the best point score (again not necessarily the fastest sailor). Likewise points are given for places in the events and at the last event a World Speedsurfing Champion is crowned.\n\nOn record attempts controlled by the World Speed Sailing Record Council (WSSRC) competitors complete timed runs on a 500m or 1 nautical mile (1,852m) course. The current 500m record (for Windsurfers) is held by French windsurfer [[Antoine Albeau]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Windsurfer Breaks Speed Record at Over 60 mph|url = http://www.redbull.com/us/en/adventure/stories/1331758080651/fastest-windsurf-run-video|website = www.redbull.com|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}</ref> The women's 500m Record is held By Zara Davis, from England, also in Luderitz.

It can be seen as comprising two distinct (but related) parts, wave riding and wave jumping.\n\nA typical wave contest will score two jumps going out and two wave rides coming in. A high scoring heat would consist of a double clean forward rotating jump, a high one foot backward rotating jump, a long wave ride with flowing bottom turns, radical top turns, a series of aerials and a 360 aerial manoeuvre on the face of the waves such as a 'goiter', 'taka', wave 360, planing forward or clean flowing back-loop. Depending on the conditions at the location, some competitions will focus more on jumping while others focus more on the wave-riding aspects.\n\nThe most famous wave riding locations on earth include: Ho'okipa on the north shore of Maui, Diamond Head on Oahu, Klitm\u00f8ller in Denmark, Pozo and Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Cabo Verde off the north west coast of Africa, Moulay in Morocco, Margaret River in Western Australia, Pacasmayo in Peru, Topocalma in Chile, and Omaezaki in Japan.\n\nThe major wavesailing competitions are organised by the Professional Windsurfing Association ('''PWA''')<ref name=\"auto3\"/> and the International Windsurfing Tour ('''IWT''').<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Together the PWA and IWT run the single most prestigious event in the windsurfing world called '''The Aloha Classic''' at Ho'okipa Beach on the north shore of Maui, Hawaii. Winning all three titles in one year, The Triple Crown, is the most elusive honour in the modern era of the sport. No rider has achieved this feat.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is strongly connected to its roots in surfing in style and culture. It involves the rider performing a series of bottom turns, top turns, and cutbacks whilst riding an unbroken wave back to the shore.  Top wave sailors are able to incorporate aerial moves into their wave riding and will use overhanging wave lips to launch themselves out in front of the wave in spectacular giant aerials.\n\n===Wave Jumping===\nWave jumping involves stunts of varying levels of difficulty which are performed after the rider has jumped from the peak of an unbroken wave. These are commonly referred to as aerial moves and include both forward rotation and backward rotations. The rider and his equipment rotate, doing single & double rotations and jumps where the sailor contorts his or her body and equipment. Recent innovations have included combining moves whilst airborne and, for the first time in 2008, one professional sailor, Ricardo Campello, has made attempts at a triple forward loop during a 2008 PWA competition.\n\n=== Big Wave Riding===\nAt the most extreme end of the sport is Big Wave Riding which means riders on waves faces over 30 feet high. The most popular place for this is on the north shore of Maui at place called Pe'ahi to the local Hawaiians, and known as JAWS to the rest of the world. The biggest waves here can be up to 60 foot faces. It breaks only in the winter months from late October to March. Other famous big wave locations include Nazar\u00e9 in Portugal. Famous contemporary big wave riders include Kai Lenny, Marcilio Browne, Robby Swift, Sarah Hauser, Jason Polakow, and Robby Naish.\n\n===Storm Riding===\nThe most famous storm riding event is known as The Red Bull Storm Chase. It occurs only when there is a massive storm forecast with winds over 60 knots and giant waves over 20 feet. It is an invitational event and is extremely dangerous. The most recent winner was West Australian Jaeger Stone.\n\n===Freestyle===\n\nFreestyle is a timed event which is judged. The competitor who has the greatest repertoire, or manages to complete most stunts, wins. Freestyle is about show and competitors are judged on their creativity. Both the difficulty and the number of tricks make up the final score. Sailors who perform tricks on both tacks (port and starboard), and perform the tricks fully planing score higher marks. High scoring moves include Shaka, Burner (funnel ponch), Double Forward Loops, the Funnell (invented by freestyle champion [[Windsurfing#International stars|Ricardo Campello]] in memory of Andy Funnell), the Chachoo and the Clew First Puneta (switch stance [[Spock (windsurfing)|Spock]]), Eslider, and [[Flaka]]. The latest freestyle windsurfing has been well documented in the film ''Four Dimensions''. For novice windsurfers, low-wind freestyle tricks are an appropriate start, such as sailing backwards with the fin out of the water, or transitioning from a sailing stance to sitting on the board while continuing to sail.\n\n===Big Air===\nCompetitors compete to see who can record the highest jump or maneuver.  A 3D accelerometer is worn to measure and record heights of the jumps.  Xensr is a manufacturer of 3D accelerometers and promoter of the Big Air competition.  It is a popular discipline on the Columbia River near the town of Hood River, Oregon, USA.\n\n==International Stars==\n<!-- This section is linked from Windsurfing -->\n\n===Top Men===\n* '''[[Robby Naish]]''' (USA): one of the first windsurfing champions to gain international fame, he dominated the early years of competition in the 1970s and 1980s.

They have presided over the PWA World Wave Titles from 1999 to 2018.]]\n\n==History==\nThe enormous popularity of the sport in the late 1970s <ref name=\"auto6\"/> and 1980s led windsurfing to be recognized as an [[Olympic sport]] in 1984 as a demonstration sport that year <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sailing_at_the_1984_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Windglider&oldid=938687974|title=Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics \u2013 Windglider|date=February 1, 2020|via=Wikipedia}}</ref>. That same year saw the first international professional tour and the first year of the Aloha Classic event at Ho'okipa on Maui's north shore <ref name=\"auto4\"/>. The Windsurfing boom continued and expanded into the 1990s with the Professional side of the sport becoming immensely popular across global media. Windsurfing had a larger global media presence than Surfing during these years. This popularity attracted significant sponsorship deals which in turn further promoted the sport with extensive paid advertising.\n\nMany of the world's top riders like Robby Naish, became wealthy and very famous athletes <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ispo.com/en/people/id_79694866/surf-star-robby-naish-water-sports-business-has-changed-.html|title=Surf Star Robby Naish: \"Water Sports Business Has Changed\"|website=Ispo.com}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/23/sport/robby-naish-windsurfing-hawaii-spt/index.html|title=How Robby Naish conquered the waves|author1=Danielle Rossingh |author2=Shirley Robertson|website=CNN}}</ref> .\n\nWindsurfing's popularity across global media saw a decline toward the end of the 1990s. This has been attributed to many possible problems within the sport including licensing battles, equipment becoming too specialized, requiring excessive expertise, the splintering of Windsurfing into various niche groups around the world and splintering of the fundamentals as constant reinvention of technology challenged what it was to be 'a windsurfer'. On top of these internal issues there was a coinciding drop in major sponsor support, directly caused by the steady introduction of international bans on cigarette advertising during the 1990s. Cigarette industry advertising had become the dominant source of sponsorship support during the early and mid 1990s boom years for the professional level of windsurfing. With the internationally legislated withdrawal of these large companies, the money spent on promoting the sport and paying for add space declined steeply and Windsurfing receded from public view across global advertising and media generally.\n\nAfter some lean years in the early 2000s, the sport has seen a steady revival. New beginner-friendly designs have become available and new corporate sponsors have emerged to once again invest in advertising and promoting the sport to align corporate values and interests for marketing.\n\nThe sport of Windsurfing is one of constant re-invention, innovation and of pioneers in water sports generally. With the advent of [[kitesurfing]], created by windsurfers, many avid windsurfers took up the similar sport for some variety after many years on the traditional windsurfer style equipment. More recently 'foiling' has become a major new interest among many windsurfers. As of 2019, longer, wider boards that are easier to sail are coming back and engaging a new generation. The sense of what it is to be 'a Windsurfer' or 'a surfer' is also changing as watermen like Kai Lenny break down barriers.\n\n===The Inventors===\n[[File:Windsurfpatent.jpg|left|thumb|Illustration from US Patent 3,487,800, filed by inventors Jim Drake and Hoyle Schweitzer on March 27, 1968]]\n\n[[File:Darby sailboard, Published Popular Science, August 1965.gif|thumbnail|Darby sailboard, Popular Science, 1965]]\n\nWindsurfing, as a sport and recreational activity, did not emerge until the latter half of the 20th century. Long before this modern moment, there were small scale sailing craft that have used wind as the driving force, many of them sourced to the [[Polynesia]]ns who have been riding the wind and waves for centuries. Early accounts suggest island peoples were undertaking day trips over oceans standing upright on a solid board with a vertical sail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofwindsurfing.net/en/press-lounge/basics/legends-of-the-sport/jim-drake.html|title=Jim Drake \u2013 Inventor of windsurfing|publisher=World of Windsurfing|accessdate=}}</ref> In the early 19th Century, people in logging communities around western [[Lake Michigan]] were purportedly fixing sails to logs as part of log float control and for recreation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deepcraft.org/deep/archives/2785|title=The Legend of Lumberjack Surfing|publisher=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, 20-year-old '''Newman Darby''' was the first to conceive the idea of using a handheld sail and rig mounted on a [[universal joint]] so that he could control his small [[catamaran]]\u2014the first rudderless sailboard ever built that allowed a person to steer by shifting his or her weight in order to tilt the sail [[Bow (ship)|fore]] and [[aft]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Chronological Order of the Development of the Free Sail System Sailboard|publisher=The Hart's Homepage|url=http://windsurf.mediaforte.com/darby/timeline.html}}</ref> Darby did not file a patent for the sailboard.

While Darby's \"sailboard\" incorporated a pivoting rig, it was \"[[square rigged]]\" or \u201ckite rigged\u201d and was subject to the associated limitations. The sailboard was operated with the sailor's back to the [[lee side]] of a kite-shaped [[sail]].

On later reflection, Drake didn't like the integrity of the idea and dismissed it. There were already a number of sailboard designs available, and Drake also was concerned about the integrity of a design needing taut wire close to a human body to keep the sail upright.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>\n\nDrake mentioned the idea to [[surfing|surfer]] '''Hoyle Schweitzer''' who wanted to develop it, but Drake was still unsure of how to control and steer what he envisaged in a design concept as a surfboard with upright sail design, whereby the sailor stood upright on the board holding the sail.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>. \n\nThe technical problem was that most boats steer by varying the angle of attack in the water between the [[centreboard|centerboard]] and the [[rudder]], and Drake's question came down to simple operation of how a standing person could control both the power of the sail as well as the direction of the craft.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>\n\nIn 1967, Drake reflected on early 17th century based sail ship control. Rudders then were weak and ineffective, mostly used for trimming course. Hence with multi-masted boats, the sailors would trim the upper sails on the forward and rearwards masts to steer the ship.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>\n\nDismissing the idea of a design with two upright sails, Drake decided to move the sail by rotation, as moving it linearly would require a mechanical system. Experimenting with a rotational design which became the concept for the [[universal joint]], whereby the angle of attack of the sail to the board could be varied to allow control of both power and direction. Drake finished the design by using an earlier, but for them, failed invention of East Coast racing sail, and added a [[Boom (windsurfing)|wishbone boom]].<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>. It is widely agreed that the 1960s, [[Jim Drake (engineer)|Jim Drake]] was the first to solve many problems of getting the board to sail. Drake passed away 2012 leaving behind a great and lasting contribution to the sport that he loved <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/business/jim-drake-creator-of-the-windsurfer-dies-at-83.html|title=Jim Drake, Creator of the Windsurfer, Dies at 83|first=Daniel E.|last=Slotnik|date=July 3, 2012|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>.\n\nThe sport had more than one early pioneer but it was '''Hoyle Schweitzer''', the savvy Californian surfer, who was the first to be successful in marketing the sailboard and creating a modern global sport from a grass roots group of innovators <ref name=\"Windsurfing\"/>. With Drake, he founded '''Windsurfing International''' and went on to build an empire around a sport that he brought to the world stage. Were it not for Schweitzer's personal drive and ambition, the world would not know windsurfing as a major global sport.\n\n===Windsurfing International===\nOn March 27, 1968, Hoyle Schweitzer (a surfer) and Jim Drake (a sailor) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/windsurfing|title=Windsurfing &#124; sport|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> filed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3487800.pdf|title=WIND-PROPELLED APPARATUS|website=www.freepatentsonline.com|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}</ref> the very first windsurfing patent, which was granted by the USPTO in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/wstartinventions/a/windsurfing.htm |title=About.com: Inventors \u2013 History of Windsurfing |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>. This combination of a surfer (rider) and a sailor (racer) would go on to define the sport in more ways than they could possibly imagine at the time. \n\nThe early windsurfing boards were made of foam in the garages of Schweitzer and Drake, with the booms, tees and daggerboards handcrafted in [[teak]]. Hoyle sub-contracted the manufacture of the teak items to boat builder Ennals Ives in [[Taiwan]], but the quality and costs of transportation brought other issues.<ref name=\"AMWindMag2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.windsurfing-academy.com/information_bank/history/interview_with_hoyle_schweitzer.asp|title=Origins of windsurfing: Hoyle Schweitzer|publisher=American Windsurfer Magazine|date=|accessdate=}}</ref> One of the early customers was Bert Salisbury, and the first international shipment of a container of boards went to [[Sweden]].<ref name=\"AMWindMag2\"/> Early customers also included [[Lufthansa]] pilots who had read about the board, who simply included one as personal luggage on their return journey from [[Los Angeles International Airport]].<ref name=\"AMWindMag2\"/>\n\nTo ensure the quality of the product and handle marketing, in 1968 Hoyle and Diana Schweitzer founded the company Windsurfing International<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/product-compint-0000618644-page.html|title=Find Local Contractors - Home Remodeling Contractors on Ecnext|website=goliath.ecnext.com|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}</ref> in Southern California to manufacture, promote, and license a windsurfer design. The jointly owned patent was wholly licensed to Windsurfing International.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/> Working in a factory unit in [[Torrance, California]], Hoyle, who had previously built personal [[surfboard]]s in his garage, was unhappy with the durability of the early \"Baja Board.\" He therefore developed a new mould, based on an old [[Malibu surfboard]] design that Matt Kivlin had developed, which the company sub-contracted for mass manufacture to Elmer Good.<ref name=\"AMWindMag2\"/>\n\nThe company registered the term \"windsurfer\" as a trademark at the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] in 1973, launching the craft as a [[one-design]] class. Going [[one-design]] was influenced by the success of the [[Laser (dinghy)|Laser]] and [[Hobie Cat]] classes. Each Windsurfer had an identical computer-cut sail, a technology new at that time and pioneered by Ian Bruce and the Laser class.\n\nIn 1968, Hoyle offered Drake a buy out of his half of the patent, and it was only when Hoyle pointed out ownership of the company that the relationship between the pair began to fall apart. Having returned to California, in 1973 Drake sold his half of the patent to Windsurfing International for the sum of $36,000.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>\n\nThe equipment consists of a board usually {{convert|2|to|2.5|m}} long, with displacements typically between {{convert|45|and|150|l}}, powered by wind on a sail.  The rig is connected to the board by a [[Coupling#Elastic|free-rotating universal joint]] and consists of a [[mast (sailing)|mast]], [[boom (sailing)|boom]] and [[sail]]. On \u201cshort\u201d boards The sail area generally ranges from {{convert|1.5|to|12|m2}} depending on the conditions, the skill of the sailor, the type of windsurfing being undertaken and the weight of the person windsurfing. On long boards, upon which the sport was first popularized -sail areas and board lengths are typically larger and the athleticism required is much less.\n\n====Patents====\nThrough the seventies, Schweitzer aggressively promoted and licensed the Windsurfing International design and licensed the patent to manufacturers worldwide, mainly through competition and the publication of a magazine.<ref name=\"AMWindMag2\"/> As a result, the sport underwent very rapid growth, particularly in Europe after the sale of a sub-license sold to Ten Cate Sports in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/> In 1975 Ten Cate Sports sold 45,000 boards in Europe.\n\nAt the same time, Schweitzer also sought to defend his patent rights vigorously against unauthorized manufacturers. This led to a host of predating windsurfer-like devices being presented to courts around the world by companies disputing Windsurfing International's rights to the invention <ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/rpc/article/102/4/59/1591300|title=WINDSURFING INTERNATIONAL INC. v.

This board used a universal joint, one of the key parts of the Windsurfing International's patent. They also found stories published about the 1948 invention of the sailboard by [[Newman Darby]] and his wife Naomi in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"oregon.com\"/>\n\nIn ''Windsurfing International Inc. v Tabur Marine (GB) Ltd. 1985 RPC 59''<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20031211083750/http://slcc.strath.ac.uk/scotslawcourse/ip/ip/patent/windsurf.html</ref> with Tabur backed financially by French sailing fan [[Baron Marcel Bich]], British courts recognized the prior art of Peter Chilvers. It did not incorporate the curved wishbone booms of the modern windsurfer, but rather a \"straight boom\" that became curved in use. The courts found that the Schweitzer windsurfer boom was \"merely an obvious extension\". This court case set a precedent for [[patent law]] in the United Kingdom, in terms of [[inventive step and non-obviousness]]; the court upheld the defendant's claim that the Schweitzer patent was invalid, based on film footage of Chilvers. Schweitzer then sued the company in Canada, where the opposition team again financially backed by Bic included Chilvers and Jim Drake, and Schweitzer lost again. After the cases, no longer obliged to pay Windsurfing International any royalty payments, the now renamed Bic Sport became one of the world's larger producers of windsurfing equipment, with an annual production of 15,000 boards.<ref name=\"BicSportHist\"/>\n\nThere is no evidence that Schweitzer or Drake had knowledge of any prior inventions similar to theirs.

Mistral's defense hinged on the work of US inventor [[Newman Darby]], who by 1965 conceived the \"sailboard\": a hand-held square rigged \"kite\" sail on a floating platform for recreational use.<ref name=\"oregon.com\"/>\n\nEventually US courts recognized the Schweitzer windsurfer as an obvious step from Darby's prior art.<ref>{{cite web |first=Laura |last=Zelasnic |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/d8625.htm |title=Technology, invention, and innovation collections |publisher=Americanhistory.si.edu |accessdate=2011-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702191042/http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/d8625.htm |archivedate=July 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Schweitzer had to reapply for a patent under severely limited terms, and finally it expired in 1987. Shortly thereafter, having lost its license royalty income, Windsurfing International ceased operations.<ref name=\"AMWindMag2\"/>\n\nIn 1984, Australian courts determined a patent case:  Windsurfing International Inc & Anor -v- Petit & Anor<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/103902464/Windsurfing-v-Petit-Judgment-28-Jun-84|title=Windsurfing v Petit - Judgment 28-Jun-84 - Rotation - Patent Infringement|website=Scribd|accessdate=August 11, 2018}}</ref> (also part reported in 3 IPR 449 or [1984] 2 NSWLR 196), which attributed the first legally accepted use of a split boom to an Australian boy, Richard Eastaugh. Between the ages of ten and thirteen, from 1946 to 1949, aided by his younger brothers, he built around 20 galvanized iron canoes and hill trolleys which he equipped with sails with split bamboo booms. He sailed these in a sitting position and not as a windsurfer standing up, near his home on the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. The judge noted that, ''\"Mr Eastaugh greatly exaggerated the capacity of his galvanised iron canoes to sail to windward\"'' and that, ''\"There is no corroboration of Mr Eastaugh's experiences by any other witness. Neither of his brothers or his father was called\"''.<ref>see pages 104\u2013105 of judgment cited</ref>\n\nIt is acknowledged in the courts that the separate Eastaugh (1946\u20131949), Darby (1965) and Chilvers (1958) inventions pre-dated the Schweitzer/Drake patent (1968).<ref name=\"AMWindMag\"/>\n\nBy the late 1980s the sport was massive and in the midst of a full blown marketing and legal battle between the original market in the USA, and the exploding European markets <ref name=\"auto5\"/>. This epic legal battle laid the ground for a still running rivalry between the European and American hemispheres.\n\n====Trademarks====\nWindsurfing International claimed trademark rights with respect to the word \"windsurfer\". While this was registered in the United States for some years, it was not accepted for registration in many jurisdictions as the word was considered too descriptive. Registration was ultimately lost in the United States for the same reason.\n\nThe Schweitzers initially chose the word for its descriptive quality. Unfortunately they immediately set out diminishing its value by naming their company \"Windsurfing International\" and even referring to themselves and their own children as \"windsurfers\". History would reveal that this nomenclature from Schweitzer did indeed become the universally accepted way of describing the sport, the participants, and the equivalent.\n\nAs the word was rejected as legally registrable for patent purposes in a number of countries, lawyers advised that to be successful the word would have to be used as a [[proper adjective]]. They realised that this required a number of generic nouns to which the adjective would apply: sailboard, boardsailing, planche a voile, segelbrett and so on. The rearguard action was ultimately unsuccessful and arguably created considerable confusion which hampered marketing efforts in later years.  Today the word windsurfer is completely dominant around the world. Schweitzer's vision of the sport is complete and now fulfilled, despite an agony process that he and his company had to endure.\n\n====Marketing====\nThe numerous patent and trademark disputes disrupted the sport during the 1980s and into the early 1990s. These disputes did not occur until well after Windsurfing International, its licensees, class associations, retailers, schools and owners had built the sport to a successful commercial basis. That success brought imitation and then the legal disputes described above <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/19820201/2262.html|title=Hoyle Schweitzer's Decade Of Discontent|first=Robert A.|last=Mamis|date=February 1, 1982|website=Inc.com}}</ref>.\n\nThe launch phase with 'Windsurfing International' saw a comprehensive development of infrastructure for a new sport and dramatic sales growth. The foundation of the sport was laid down in this way by Windsurfing International and this extraordinarily clear vision has provided the sport with its powerful and demonstrated endurance.\n\nDarby is now largely recognised as the 'original inventor', while the massive growth of the sport is largely attributed to Schweitzer with his elegant refinement of the craft from a surfing background and his savvy business investment strategy. The sport of Windsurfing now honours both these individuals as the founders of the modern sport.\n\n==Equipment==\nWindsurfers are often classified as either '''shortboards''' or '''longboards'''. Longboards are usually longer than 3 meters, with a retractable [[daggerboard]], and were optimized for lighter winds or course racing. Shortboards were less than 3 meters long and were designed for [[Planing (sailing)|planing]] conditions.\n\nWhile windsurfing is possible under a wide range of wind conditions, most intermediate and advanced recreational windsurfers prefer to sail in conditions that allow for consistent planing with multi-purpose, not overly specialized, free-ride equipment. Larger (100 to 140 liters) free-ride boards are capable of planing at wind speeds as low as {{convert|12|kn|m/s|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} if rigged with an adequate, well-tuned sail in the six to eight square meter range. The pursuit of planing in lower winds has driven the popularity of wider and shorter boards, with which planing is possible in wind as low as {{convert|8|kn|m/s|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, if sails in the 10 to 12 square meter range are used.\n\nModern windsurfing boards can be classified into many categories:\nThe original ''Windsurfer'' board had a body made out of [[polyethylene]] filled with [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] foam. Later, hollow [[glass-reinforced plastic|glass-reinforced epoxy]] designs were used. Most boards produced today have an [[expanded polystyrene]] foam core reinforced with a composite sandwich shell, that can include [[carbon fiber]], [[kevlar]], or [[fiberglass]] in a matrix of [[epoxy]] and sometimes [[plywood]] and [[thermoplastic]]s. Racing and wave boards are usually very light (5 to 7&nbsp;kg), and are made out of carbon sandwich. Such boards are very stiff, and veneer is sometimes used to make them more shock-resistant. Boards aimed at the beginners are heavier (8 to 15&nbsp;kg) and more robust, containing more fiberglass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boardlady.com/anatomy.htm |title=Anatomy of an Epoxy Sandwich board |first=Eva-M. |last=Hollman |publisher=The Board Lady |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n*'''Beginner boards''': (Sometimes called funboards) these often have a [[daggerboard]], are almost as wide as Formula boards, and have plenty of volume, hence stability.\n*'''Freeride''': Boards meant for comfortable recreational cruising (mostly straight-line sailing and occasional turning) at planing speed (aka blasting), mainly in flat waters or in light to moderate swell. They typically fall into the volume range of 90 to 170 liters. The so-called freeride sailing movement diverged from course racing as more recreational sailors chose to sail freely without being constrained to sailing on courses around buoys.\n*'''Racing longboards''': [[Mistral One Design]], or the Olympic RS:X class race boards.\n*'''[[Formula Windsurfing]] Class''': Shorter boards up to one meter in width, for use in Formula Windsurfing races. See [[#Formula class|below]] for a more detailed description.[[File:Windsurf.600pix.jpg|right|thumb|Windsurfing in the late evening on a longboard at [[Sandbanks]] in the 1980s ([[Poole Harbour]], England).]]\n*'''Slalom boards''': In the past, the key feature of slalom boards was merely speed, but it has been proven that maneuverability and ease of use are as important as speed in order to get you around the slalom course faster, and therefore modern slalom boards are shortboards aimed at top speed, maneuverability and ease of use. \n*'''Speed boards''': In essence an extremely narrow and sleek slalom board, built for top speed only.\n*'''Freestyle boards''': Related to wave boards in terms of maneuverability, these are wider, higher volume boards geared specifically at performing acrobatic tricks (jumps, rotations, slides, flips and loops) on flat water. Usually 80 to 110 liters in volume, and about 203 to 230 centimeters in length, with widths frequently in excess of 60 centimeters. Freestyle boards began to diverge more noticeably in design from wave boards in the early part of the 2000 decade, as aerial tricks (the Vulcan, Spock, Grubby, Flaka, and related '''New School''' maneuvers, almost all involving a jump-and-spin component) became the predominant part of the freestyle repertoire, superseding '''Old School''' moves, in which the board did not leave contact with the water.\n*'''Wave boards''': Smaller, lighter, more maneuverable boards for use in breaking waves. Characteristically, sailors on wave boards perform high jumps while sailing against waves, and they ride the face of a wave performing narrow linked turns (bottom turns, cutbacks, and top-turns) in a similar way to [[surfing]]. Wave boards usually have a volume between 65 and 105 liters, with a length between 215 and 235 centimeters, and 50 to 60 centimeters in width. A general rule is for a sailor to use a wave board whose volume in liters is about the same as the sailor's weight in kilograms \u2013 more volume providing additional flotation for sailing in light winds, and less for high winds, where less volume is needed to achieve planing. In recent years, the average width of wave boards has increased slightly, as the length has shrunk, while the range of volume has been maintained the same more or less\u2014according to board designers this makes wave boards easier to use under a wider range of conditions by sailors of differing abilities. The most common sizes of sails used with wave boards are in the range of 3.4 to 6.0 square meters, depending on the wind speed and the weight of the sailor.\n\n'''Sails'''\n{{main|Sail}}\n\nModern windsurfing [[sail]]<nowiki/>s are often made of monofilm (clear polyester film), dacron (woven [[polyester]]) and [[mylar]]. Areas under high load may be reinforced with [[kevlar]].\n\nTwo designs of a sail are predominant: [[camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] induced and rotational. Cambered sails have 1\u20135 camber inducers - plastic devices at the ends of [[Sail batten|batten]]s which cup against the mast. They help create a rigid [[aerofoil]] shape for faster speed and stability, but at the cost of maneuverability and how light the sail feels. The trend is that racier sails have camber inducers while wave sails and most recreational sails do not. The rigidity of the sail is also determined by a number of ''battens''.\n\nBeginners' sails often do not have ''battens'', so they are lighter and easier to use in light winds. However, as the sailor improves, a battened sail will provide greater stability in stronger winds.\n\nRotational sails have ''battens'' which protrude beyond the back aspect of the mast. They flip or \"rotate\" to the other side of the mast when tacking or jibing, hence the rotation in the name. Rotational sails have an aerofoil shape on the [[leeward]] side when powered, but are nearly flat when sheeted out (unpowered). In comparison with cambered sails, rotational designs offer less power and stability when sailing straight, but are easier to handle when maneuvering. Rotational sails are usually lighter and easier to rig.\n\nA windsurfing sail is tensioned at two points: at the tack (by [[downhaul]]), and at the clew (by [[outhaul]]). There is a set of [[pulley]]s for downhauling at the tack, and a [[grommet]] at the [[clew]]. Most shape is given to the sail by applying a very strong downhaul, which by design bends the mast. The outhaul tension is relatively weak, mostly providing leverage for controlling the sail's angle of attack.\n\nThe sail is tuned by adjusting the downhaul and the outhaul tension. Generally, a sail is trimmed more (flatter shape) for stronger winds. More downhaul tension loosens the upper part of the leech, allowing the top of the sail to twist and \"spill\" wind during gusts, shifting the center of effort (strictly, the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]]) down. Releasing downhaul tension shifts the center of effort up. More outhaul lowers the camber/draft, making the sail flatter and easier to control, but less powerful; less outhaul results in more draft, providing more low-end power, but usually limiting speed by increasing aerodynamic resistance.\n\nThe disciplines of windsurfing (wave, freestyle, freeride) require different sails. Wave sails are reinforced to survive the surf, and are nearly flat when depowered to allow riding waves. Freestyle sails are also flat when depowered, and have high low-end power to allow quick acceleration. Freeride sails are all-rounders that are comfortable to use and are meant for recreational windsurfing. Race sails provide speed at the expense of qualities like comfort or maneuverability.\n\nThe size of the sail is measured in square meters and can be from 3&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> to 5.5&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> for wave sails and 6&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> to 15&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> for race sails, with ranges for freestyle and freeride sails spanning somewhere between these extremes. Learning sails for children can be as small as 0.7&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> and race sails up to 15&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>.\n\n'''Associated Equipment'''\n*[[Mast (sailing)|Mast]]\n*[[Boom (windsurfing)|Boom]]\n*[[Fin]] (similar shape to a [[surfboard fin]] but is usually stronger for windsurfing)\n*Universal joint ([[Coupling#Elastic|elastic joints]] are more common, but some are [[Universal joint|mechanical]])\n*[[Windsurfing harness|Harness]] and Harness lines\n*[[Wet suit]]/[[Dry suit]]\n*[[Wetsuit boot|Footwear]]\n*[[Helmet]]\n*[[Personal flotation device]]\n*Travel Gear \u2013 Sail Bags, Board Bags, Car Racks\n*Safety gear: line, distress strobe light, whistle, [[Marine VHF radio]] <ref>''[http://www.sfba.org/index.php/safety/windsurfing-safety Windsurfing Safety] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808055429/http://www.sfba.org/index.php/safety/windsurfing-safety |date=August 8, 2014 }}'', San Francisco Boardsailing Association (SFBA)</ref>\n\n==Technique==\nA sailboard will move, depending on wind conditions and the skill or intentions of the rider, in two entirely different manners, with two different [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]]s; it will either sail or hydroplane (referred to as \"[[planing (sailing)|planing]]\"). A sensation likened to low-level flying may be experienced by the hydroplaning windsurfer.\n\n===Beginners===\nLearning to windsurf is now easy with the development of wider, high volume beginner boards. The transition time from beginner to intermediate is now 2-3 weeks of daily sailing. Beginners, start on a large board with a tiny triangular sail in light wind in an area of safe flat water.\n\n===Youth===\nWindsurfing is suitable for children as young as 5, with several board and sail brands producing \"Kids Rigs\" to accommodate these short and light weight windsurfers.  In some countries, organisations exist to provide entry into the sport in a semi-formal or club-style environment (i.e. The RYA's Team 15 scheme).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rya.org.uk/programmes/team15/Pages/default.aspx |title=Team 15 |publisher=\"RYA |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>. Robert (Robby) Naish took up the fledgling sport of windsurfing at the age of 11, and in 1976 won his first overall World Championship title at the age of 13.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Light Winds===\nThe board moves through the water \u2013 much like a sailing boat does \u2013 using an extendable centreboard (if available) and [[fin]] or [[skeg]] for stability and lateral resistance. The centreboard is retracted at broad [[points of sail]], again similarly to a sailing boat, to allow for jibing control. In these conditions windsurf boards also [[Tack (sailing)|tack]] and [[Jibe (sailing)|jibe]] like a sailing boat.\n\n'''Directional Control''' is achieved by moving the rig either forward (turning away from the wind) or aft (turning towards the wind). When jibing, the clew of the sail is let around and allowed to rotate out and around the mast.\n\n'''Fall Recovery'''. The rider climbs onto the board, grabs the pulling rope (''uphaul''), makes sure the mast foot is placed between his/her two feet, pulls the sail about one third out of the water, lets the wind turn the sail-board combination till he/she has the wind right in the back, pulls the sail all the way out, places the \"mast hand\" (hand closest to the mast) on the boom, pulls the mast over the center line of the board, places the \"sail hand\" (hand furthest from the mast) on the boom, then pulling on it to close the sail and power it.\n\n===Strong Winds===\n[[File:Sail Size Selection Table.png|right|thumb|Ideal sail size (m\u00b2) for different wind speeds and rider weights (recreational level). The red values indicate sail sizes that are unpractical or not available.]]\nIn planing conditions a harness is typically worn to more efficiently use the rider's weight to counter the force in the sail. As the wind increases, the rider continues to sheet the sail, the fin generates more lift, and the board gains speed, transitioning onto a ''plane''. The volume of board in the water (''displacement'') decreases, and the rider moves rearward, stepping into the footstraps for improved control. When planing, the board skims on the surface rather than displacing water as it moves. Planing can be achieved at different wind speeds depending on the rider's weight, sail and fin size, wave conditions, and rider ability. With modern equipment planing can normally be achieved at a wind speed of around {{convert|12|kn|m/s|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. The transition from displacement motion to planing requires a jump in energy, but once planing, water resistance decreases dramatically. This means that it is possible to continue to plane, although the wind has dropped below a level that would be required to transition to plane. A board in plane can be much smaller than a board moving by displacement (thereby gaining an advantage in gear weight and board control). Lateral resistance to the wind is provided by the fin alone (generating more lift at higher speeds) and a centreboard is no longer used (smaller boards do not have one). A fin generates lift, transferring a strong load to the board, and so is usually constructed of carbon fiber for accurate shape and strength. A low-pressure area develops on the windward side of the fin, which can lead to [[cavitation]], leading to a sudden loss of lift, called \"spin-out\" (equivalent to [[Stall (fluid dynamics)|\"stalling\"]] in flight terminology). Ideal planing conditions for most recreational riders is {{convert|15|-|25|kn|m/s|abbr=on|round=each}} of wind, but experts can windsurf in much windier conditions. Planing is considered one of the most exhilarating aspects of the sport.\n\n'''Steering''' is mainly achieved by putting rider weight pressure on either the left or the right rail (edge) of the board. Jibing is done at full speed (a so-called \"carve jibe\", \"power jibe\" or \"planing jibe\"), whereby the rider continues to apply pressure on the inside rail of the turn, leaning into the turn much like a [[snowboarder]] making a toe-side turn. Pressure is released from the sail as the board speed turns downwind, allowing for the sail to be jibed. Tacking is still possible, but at these conditions has become an advanced maneuver, because it requires quick movements and good balance. A heel-side turn while planing (called a \"cut-back\") is usually only executed in wave riding.\n\n'''Water-start''': In strong winds it is difficult to uphaul the sail (pulling it out of the water while standing on the board) so [[Waterstart|''waterstarting'']] is necessary. This is done (while [[water treading]]) by positioning the mast perpendicular to the wind, lifting the luff out of the water to allow the wind to catch the sail, and then having the sail pull the sailor onto the board. As the sail becomes powered, it is then trimmed to bring the rider, board, and sail back onto a plane. Occasionally a rider may be unable to waterstart if the wind has dropped. If this happens the rider can wait for a gust and \"''pump''\" the sail to get back on the board. If this becomes hopeless uphauling the sail will be necessary.\n\n==Racers==\n\n===Long-Board Classes===\n\n===Olympic class===\n{{main|Sailboarding at the Summer Olympics}}\n\nSailboarding has been one of the Olympic [[Sailing at the Olympics|sailing events]] at the [[Summer Olympics]] since 1984 for men and 1992 for women. Olympic Windsurfing uses 'One Design' boards, with all sailors using the same boards, [[daggerboard]]s, fins and sails. The equipment is chosen to allow racing in a wide range of sailing conditions. This is important for the [[Olympic Games]], as events have to take place regardless of whether there is enough wind for planing. The current Olympic class, the [[Neil Pryde RS:X]] was used for the first time in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. For 2024 the new Olympic Class windsurfer will use advanced foil technology <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surfertoday.com/windsurfing/ifoil-the-new-olympic-windsurfing-equipment|title=iQFoil: the new Olympic windsurfing equipment|first=|last=|website=Surfertoday}}</ref>.\n\n===Formula class===\n{{main|Formula Windsurfing}}\n[[File:Bry.jpg|right|thumb|Formula racer in [[San Francisco Bay]].]]\n[[Formula Windsurfing|Formula windsurfing]] has developed over the last 15 years in order to facilitate high-performance competition in light and moderate winds. Formula is now a class of windsurfing boards controlled by the [[International Sailing Federation]] that has the principal characteristic of a maximum 1m width. They have a single [[fin]] of maximum length 70&nbsp;cm and carry sails up to 12.5 m\u00b2. Class rules allow sailors to choose boards produced by multiple manufacturers, as long as they are certified as Formula boards and registered with ISAF, and use fins and sails of different sizes. With the sail, fin and board choices, the equipment is able to be tailored to suit sailors of all body shapes and formula windsurfing presents one of the fastest course-racing sailing craft on the water. Formula Windsurfing is popular in many locations around the globe with predominantly light winds and flat water.\n\nLarge sails in combination with the 'wide-style' design allow planing in very low wind conditions as well as control and usability in high winds and bigger sea conditions. Non-planing sailing is very difficult with this design and racing is only conducted with a strict {{convert|7|kn|m/s|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} wind minimum in place. Formula boards are used on \"flat water\" as opposed to coastal surf, but racing is still held in windy conditions involving swell and chop. In 2008, a Formula Windsurfing Grand-Prix World Tour began, with events in Europe and South America complementing the single-event World Championships as a professional tour for the Formula class.\n\nFormula boards have excellent upwind and downwind ability, but are not as comfortable on a [[Points of sail#Beam reach|beam reach]] unless fin sizes are reduced. This explains why the course is usually a box with longer upwind and downwind legs, or just a simple upwind-downwind return course.\n\n===Raceboard Class===\nRaceboards are longer windsurf boards with a daggerboard and movable mast rail allowing the sailor to be efficient on all points of sail. Excellent upwind ability is combined with good reaching and even downwind ability typically sailed in an Olympic triangle course. Whilst in decline in manufacture since the advent of shortboard course racing (which evolved into Formula) there remains some models in production and most notably the [[Mistral One Design Class|IMCO]] One Design remains popular amongst amateur racing clubs.\n\n===Short-Board Classes===\n\n===Slalom===\nSlalom is a high-speed race. Typically there are two sorts of slalom courses.\n*Figure of eight: All of the course should on a beam reach with two floating marks that have to be [[Jibe (sailing)|jibe]]d around.\n*Downwind: More than two marks are laid and sailors sail a downwind course \u2013 gybing around each mark only once.\nSlalom boards are small and narrow, and require high winds. Funboard class racing rules require winds of {{convert|9|-|35|kn|m/s|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} for the slalom event to take place. \n\n===Ocean Slalom Marathon===\nThere are 3 major Ocean Slalom Marathons in the world: The Defi-Wind in France, The Lancelin Ocean Classic in Western Australia, and the Hatterass Marathon in the USA.\n\n===Super X===\nThis discipline is a cross between freestyle and slalom. Competitors race on a short downwind slalom course, must duck jibe on all turns, and are required to perform several tricks along the way. Competitors are required to wear protective equipment.  The Super X discipline was short lived and is now largely unpracticed; it reached its peak in the early 2000s,\n\n===Speedsailing===\nSpeedsailing takes place in several forms. The ISWC (International Speed Windsurfing Class) organizes (under the umbrella of the ISAF) competitions in various locations around the world known for conditions suitable for good speeds. The events are made up of heats sailed on a 500m course. The average of each sailor's best 2 speeds on the 500m course, which is typically open for 2 hours per heat, is their speed for that heat. As such it is possible for the sailor with the outright fastest time not to win the heat if his second best time pulls his average down. Points are given for the placings in the heats and the overall event winner is the sailor with the best point score (again not necessarily the fastest sailor). Likewise points are given for places in the events and at the last event a World Speedsurfing Champion is crowned.\n\nOn record attempts controlled by the World Speed Sailing Record Council (WSSRC) competitors complete timed runs on a 500m or 1 nautical mile (1,852m) course. The current 500m record (for Windsurfers) is held by French windsurfer [[Antoine Albeau]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Windsurfer Breaks Speed Record at Over 60 mph|url = http://www.redbull.com/us/en/adventure/stories/1331758080651/fastest-windsurf-run-video|website = www.redbull.com|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}</ref> The women's 500m Record is held By Zara Davis, from England, also in Luderitz.

It can be seen as comprising two distinct (but related) parts, wave riding and wave jumping.\n\nA typical wave contest will score two jumps going out and two wave rides coming in. A high scoring heat would consist of a double clean forward rotating jump, a high one foot backward rotating jump, a long wave ride with flowing bottom turns, radical top turns, a series of aerials and a 360 aerial manoeuvre on the face of the waves such as a 'goiter', 'taka', wave 360, planing forward or clean flowing back-loop. Depending on the conditions at the location, some competitions will focus more on jumping while others focus more on the wave-riding aspects.\n\nThe most famous wave riding locations on earth include: Ho'okipa on the north shore of Maui, Diamond Head on Oahu, Klitm\u00f8ller in Denmark, Pozo and Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Cabo Verde off the north west coast of Africa, Moulay in Morocco, Margaret River in Western Australia, Pacasmayo in Peru, Topocalma in Chile, and Omaezaki in Japan. \n\nThe major wavesailing competitions are organised by the Professional Windsurfing Association ('''PWA''')<ref name=\"auto3\"/> and the International Windsurfing Tour ('''IWT''') <ref name=\"auto1\"/>. Together the PWA and IWT run the single most prestigious event in the windsurfing world called '''The Aloha Classic''' at Ho'okipa Beach on the north shore of Maui, Hawaii. Winning all three titles in one year, The Triple Crown, is the most elusive honour in the modern era of the sport. No rider has achieved this feat.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is strongly connected to its roots in surfing in style and culture. It involves the rider performing a series of bottom turns, top turns, and cutbacks whilst riding an unbroken wave back to the shore.  Top wave sailors are able to incorporate aerial moves into their wave riding and will use overhanging wave lips to launch themselves out in front of the wave in spectacular giant aerials.\n\n===Wave Jumping===\nWave jumping involves stunts of varying levels of difficulty which are performed after the rider has jumped from the peak of an unbroken wave. These are commonly referred to as aerial moves and include both forward rotation and backward rotations. The rider and his equipment rotate, doing single & double rotations and jumps where the sailor contorts his or her body and equipment. Recent innovations have included combining moves whilst airborne and, for the first time in 2008, one professional sailor, Ricardo Campello, has made attempts at a triple forward loop during a 2008 PWA competition.\n\n=== Big Wave Riding===\nAt the most extreme end of the sport is Big Wave Riding which means riders on waves faces over 30 feet high. The most popular place for this is on the north shore of Maui at place called Pe'ahi to the local Hawaiians, and known as JAWS to the rest of the world. The biggest waves here can be up to 60 foot faces. It breaks only in the winter months from late October to March. Other famous big wave locations include Nazar\u00e9 in Portugal. Famous contemporary big wave riders include Kai Lenny, Marcilio Browne, Robby Swift, Sarah Hauser, Jason Polakow, and Robby Naish.\n\n===Storm Riding===\nThe most famous storm riding event is known as The Red Bull Storm Chase. It occurs only when there is a massive storm forecast with winds over 60 knots and giant waves over 20 feet. It is an invitational event and is extremely dangerous. The most recent winner was West Australian Jaeger Stone.\n\n===Freestyle===\n\nFreestyle is a timed event which is judged. The competitor who has the greatest repertoire, or manages to complete most stunts, wins. Freestyle is about show and competitors are judged on their creativity. Both the difficulty and the number of tricks make up the final score. Sailors who perform tricks on both tacks (port and starboard), and perform the tricks fully planing score higher marks. High scoring moves include Shaka, Burner (funnel ponch), Double Forward Loops, the Funnell (invented by freestyle champion [[Windsurfing#International stars|Ricardo Campello]] in memory of Andy Funnell), the Chachoo and the Clew First Puneta (switch stance [[Spock (windsurfing)|Spock]]), Eslider, and [[Flaka]]. The latest freestyle windsurfing has been well documented in the film ''Four Dimensions''. For novice windsurfers, low-wind freestyle tricks are an appropriate start, such as sailing backwards with the fin out of the water, or transitioning from a sailing stance to sitting on the board while continuing to sail.\n\n===Big Air===\nCompetitors compete to see who can record the highest jump or maneuver.  A 3D accelerometer is worn to measure and record heights of the jumps.  Xensr is a manufacturer of 3D accelerometers and promoter of the Big Air competition.  It is a popular discipline on the Columbia River near the town of Hood River, Oregon, USA.\n\n==International Stars==\n<!-- This section is linked from Windsurfing -->\n\n===Top Men===\n* '''[[Robby Naish]]''' (USA): one of the first windsurfing champions to gain international fame, he dominated the early years of competition in the 1970s and 1980s.

Hart (left) and Gregory Newby (right) of Project Gutenberg, 2006]]\n\n[[Michael S. Hart]] began Project Gutenberg in 1971 with the digitization of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].<ref name=\"Hobbes_netTL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/ |title=Hobbes' Internet Timeline |accessdate=17 February 2009}}</ref> Hart, a student at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]], obtained access to a [[SDS Sigma series|Xerox Sigma V]] [[mainframe computer]] in the university's Materials Research Lab. Through friendly operators, he received an account with a virtually unlimited amount of computer time; its value at that time has since been variously estimated at $100,000 or $100,000,000.<ref name=\"GP_history\">{{cite web|first=Michael S. |last=Hart |authorlink=Michael S.

His initial goal was to make the 10,000 most consulted books available to the public at little or no charge, and to do so by the end of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Day, B.

Hart believed one day the general public would be able to access computers and decided to make works of literature available in electronic form for free. He used a copy of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in his backpack, and this became the first Project Gutenberg [[e-text]]. He named the project after [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the fifteenth century German printer who propelled the [[movable type]] [[printing press]] revolution.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Hart was running Project Gutenberg from [[Benedictine University|Illinois Benedictine College]]. More volunteers had joined the effort. He manually entered all of the text until 1989 when [[image scanner]]s and [[optical character recognition]] software improved and became more available, making [[book scanning]] more feasible.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Vauhini |last=Vara |title=Project Gutenberg Fears No Google |work=Wall Street Journal |date=5 December 2005 |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113415403113218620 |accessdate=15 August 2007}}</ref> Hart later came to an arrangement with [[Carnegie Mellon University]], which agreed to administer Project Gutenberg's finances. As the volume of e-texts increased, volunteers began to take over the project's day-to-day operations that Hart had run.\n\nStarting in 2004, an improved online catalog made Project Gutenberg content easier to browse, access and [[hyperlink]]. Project Gutenberg is now hosted by [[ibiblio]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].\n\nItalian volunteer Pietro Di Miceli developed and administered the first Project Gutenberg website and started the development of the Project online Catalog. In his ten years in this role (1994\u20132004), the Project web pages won a number of awards, often being featured in \"best of the Web\" listings, and contributing to the project's popularity.<ref>{{cite web|date=8 June 2006 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Credits |title=Gutenberg:Credits |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=15 August 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711033646/http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg%3ACredits |archivedate=11 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nHart died on 6 September 2011 at his home in Urbana, Illinois at the age of 64.<ref>{{cite web|date=6 September 2011 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart |title=Michael_S._Hart |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=25 September 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917035457/http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart |archivedate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Affiliated organizations ===\nIn 2000, a [[non-profit organization|non-profit corporation]], the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, Inc. was chartered in [[Mississippi]], [[United States]] to handle the project's legal needs. Donations to it are [[tax deduction|tax-deductible]]. Long-time Project Gutenberg volunteer Gregory Newby became the foundation's first [[chief executive officer|CEO]].<ref name=\"it21\" />\n\nAlso in 2000, Charles Franks founded [[Distributed Proofreaders]] (DP), which allowed the proofreading of scanned texts to be distributed among many volunteers over the Internet. This effort increased the number and variety of texts being added to Project Gutenberg, as well as making it easier for new volunteers to start contributing. DP became officially affiliated with Project Gutenberg in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff |date=August 2007 |url=http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/dpf.php |title=The Distributed Proofreaders Foundation |publisher=Distributed proofreaders |accessdate=10 August 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821001333/http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/dpf.php |archivedate=21 August 2007 }}</ref> {{As of|2018}}, the 36,000+ DP-contributed books comprised almost two-thirds of the nearly {{Num PG books}} books in Project Gutenberg.\n\n== CD and DVD project ==\nIn August 2003, Project Gutenberg created a [[Compact disc|CD]] containing approximately 600 of the \"best\" e-books from the collection. The CD is available for download as an [[ISO image]]. When users are unable to download the CD, they can request to have a copy sent to them, free of charge.\n\nIn December 2003, a [[DVD]] was created containing nearly 10,000 items. At the time, this represented almost the entire collection. In early 2004, the DVD also became available by mail.\n\nIn July 2007, a new edition of the DVD was released containing over 17,000 books, and in April 2010, a dual-layer DVD was released, containing nearly 30,000 items.\n\nThe majority of the DVDs, and all of the CDs mailed by the project, were recorded on recordable media by volunteers. However, the new dual layer DVDs were manufactured, as it proved more economical than having volunteers burn them. {{As of|2010|10}}, the project has mailed approximately 40,000 discs. As of 2017, the delivery of free CDs has been discontinued, though the ISO image is still available for download.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:The_CD_and_DVD_Project |title=The CD and DVD Project |publisher=Gutenberg |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005200927/http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg%3AThe_CD_and_DVD_Project |archivedate=5 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Scope of collection ==\n[[File:Project Gutenberg total books.svg|thumb|Growth of Project Gutenberg publications from 1994 until 2015]]\n\n{{As of|2015|08}}, Project Gutenberg claimed over {{Num PG books}} items in its collection, with an average of over 50 new [[e-book]]s being added each week.<ref>According to\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX-2006.txt gutindex-2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113114837/http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX-2006.txt |date=13 November 2012 }}, there were 1,653 new Project Gutenberg items posted in the first 33 weeks of 2006.

The most common non-ASCII format is [[HTML]], which allows markup and illustrations to be included. Some project members and users have requested more advanced formats, believing them to be much easier to read. But some formats that are not easily editable, such as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], are generally not considered to fit in with the goals of Project Gutenberg. Also Project Gutenberg has two options for master formats that can be submitted (from which all other files are generated): customized versions of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] standard (since 2005)<ref>{{cite web|date=12 April 2005 |url=http://pgtei.pglaf.org/marcello/0.3/doc/20000-h.html |title=The Guide to PGTEI |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=7 February 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518140059/http://pgtei.pglaf.org/marcello/0.3/doc/20000-h.html |archivedate=18 May 2013 }}</ref> and [[reStructuredText]] (since 2011).<ref>{{cite book|date=25 November 2010 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/181 |title=The Project Gutenberg RST Manual |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=8 February 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126113034/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/181 |archivedate=26 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 2009, the Project Gutenberg catalog began offering auto-generated alternate file formats, including HTML (when not already provided), [[EPUB]] and [[plucker]].<ref>{{cite web|date=4 April 2010 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Help_on_Bibliographic_Record_Page |title=Help on Bibliographic Record |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=3 September 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917121302/http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg%3AHelp_on_Bibliographic_Record_Page |archivedate=17 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Ideals ==\nMichael Hart said in 2004, \"The mission of Project Gutenberg is simple: 'To encourage the creation and distribution of ebooks'\".<ref name=\"hart1\" /> His goal was, \"to provide as many e-books in as many formats as possible for the entire world to read in as many languages as possible\".<ref name=USINFO /> Likewise, a project slogan is to \"break down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy\",<ref>{{cite web\n |url = http://www.gutenbergnews.org/nl_archives/2003/pgweekly_2003_12_10_part_2.txt \n |title=The Project Gutenberg Weekly Newsletter \n |date=10 December 2003 \n |publisher=Project Gutenberg \n |accessdate=8 June 2008 \n |url-status=live \n |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110511114558/http://www.gutenbergnews.org/nl_archives/2003/pgweekly_2003_12_10_part_2.txt \n |archivedate=11 May 2011 \n}}</ref> because its volunteers aim to continue spreading public [[literacy]] and appreciation for the literary heritage just as [[public library|public libraries]] began to do in the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Perry\n |first       = Ruth\n |year        = 2007\n |url         = http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_primaryrecords/repview_records/primary_records10\n |title       = Postscript about the Public Libraries\n |publisher   = Modern Language Association\n |accessdate  = 20 August 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070809000621/http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_primaryrecords/repview_records/primary_records10\n |archivedate = 9 August 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | last=Lorenzen | first=Michael | year=2002\n | url=http://www.michaellorenzen.com/carnegie.html\n | title=Deconstructing the Philanthropic Library: The Sociological Reasons Behind Andrew Carnegie's Millions to Libraries\n | publisher=Modern Language Association\n | accessdate=20 August 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070813224610/http://www.michaellorenzen.com/carnegie.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 August 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nProject Gutenberg is intentionally decentralized.

In an effort to ensure this, the entire collection is backed-up regularly and [[mirror site|mirrored]] on servers in many different locations.<ref>{{cite book | title=Information Technology and Collection Management for Library User Environments |isbn = 9781466647404| url=https://books.google.com/?id=H-ZGAwAAQBAJ&pg=PR15&lpg=PR15&dq=information+technology+and+collection+management+for+library+user+environments#v=onepage|last1 = Walker|first1 = Joseph|date = 30 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Copyright ==\nProject Gutenberg is careful to verify the status of its ebooks according to [[Copyright law of the United States|United States copyright law]]. Material is added to the Project Gutenberg archive only after it has received a copyright clearance, and records of these clearances are saved for future reference. Project Gutenberg does not claim new copyright on titles it publishes. Instead, it encourages their free reproduction and distribution.<ref name=USINFO/>\n\nMost books in the Project Gutenberg collection are distributed as [[public domain]] under United States copyright law. There are also a few copyrighted texts, such as those of [[science fiction]] author [[Cory Doctorow]], that Project Gutenberg distributes with permission. These are subject to further restrictions as specified by the copyright holder, although they generally tend to be licensed under [[Creative Commons]].\n\n\"Project Gutenberg\" is a [[trademark]] of the organization, and the mark cannot be used in commercial or modified redistributions of public domain texts from the project. There is no legal impediment to the reselling of works in the public domain if all references to Project Gutenberg are removed, but Gutenberg contributors have questioned the appropriateness of directly and commercially reusing content that has been formatted by volunteers.<ref name=\"wapo\"/> There have been instances of books being stripped of attribution to the project and sold for profit in the [[Kindle Store]] and other booksellers, one being the 1906 book ''Fox Trapping''.<ref name=\"wapo\">{{Cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2010/11/amazon_charges_kindle_users_fo.html|title=Amazon charges Kindle users for free Project Gutenberg e-books|last=Pegoraro|first=Rob|date=30 November 2010|work=Washington Post|access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough not accessible for years within [[Germany]] to comply with a court order from [[S.

Hart believed one day the general public would be able to access computers and decided to make works of literature available in electronic form for free. He used a copy of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in his backpack, and this became the first Project Gutenberg [[e-text]]. He named the project after [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the fifteenth century German printer who propelled the [[movable type]] [[printing press]] revolution.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Hart was running Project Gutenberg from [[Benedictine University|Illinois Benedictine College]]. More volunteers had joined the effort. He manually entered all of the text until 1989 when [[image scanner]]s and [[optical character recognition]] software improved and became more available, making [[book scanning]] more feasible.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Vauhini |last=Vara |title=Project Gutenberg Fears No Google |work=Wall Street Journal |date=5 December 2005 |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113415403113218620 |accessdate=15 August 2007}}</ref> Hart later came to an arrangement with [[Carnegie Mellon University]], which agreed to administer Project Gutenberg's finances. As the volume of e-texts increased, volunteers began to take over the project's day-to-day operations that Hart had run.\n\nStarting in 2004, an improved online catalog made Project Gutenberg content easier to browse, access and [[hyperlink]]. Project Gutenberg is now hosted by [[ibiblio]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].\n\nItalian volunteer Pietro Di Miceli developed and administered the first Project Gutenberg website and started the development of the Project online Catalog. In his ten years in this role (1994\u20132004), the Project web pages won a number of awards, often being featured in \"best of the Web\" listings, and contributing to the project's popularity.<ref>{{cite web|date=8 June 2006 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Credits |title=Gutenberg:Credits |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=15 August 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711033646/http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg%3ACredits |archivedate=11 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nHart died on 6 September 2011 at his home in Urbana, Illinois at the age of 64.<ref>{{cite web|date=6 September 2011 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart |title=Michael_S._Hart |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=25 September 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917035457/http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Michael_S._Hart |archivedate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Affiliated organizations ===\nIn 2000, a [[non-profit organization|non-profit corporation]], the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, Inc. was chartered in [[Mississippi]], [[United States]] to handle the project's legal needs.

The CD is available for download as an [[ISO image]]. When users are unable to download the CD, they can request to have a copy sent to them, free of charge.\n\nIn December 2003, a [[DVD]] was created containing nearly 10,000 items. At the time, this represented almost the entire collection.

There are also a few copyrighted texts, such as those of [[science fiction]] author [[Cory Doctorow]], that Project Gutenberg distributes with permission. These are subject to further restrictions as specified by the copyright holder, although they generally tend to be licensed under [[Creative Commons]].\n\n\"Project Gutenberg\" is a [[trademark]] of the organization, and the mark cannot be used in commercial or modified redistributions of public domain texts from the project. There is no legal impediment to the reselling of works in the public domain if all references to Project Gutenberg are removed, but Gutenberg contributors have questioned the appropriateness of directly and commercially reusing content that has been formatted by volunteers.<ref name=\"wapo\"/> There have been instances of books being stripped of attribution to the project and sold for profit in the [[Kindle Store]] and other booksellers, one being the 1906 book ''Fox Trapping''.<ref name=\"wapo\">{{Cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2010/11/amazon_charges_kindle_users_fo.html|title=Amazon charges Kindle users for free Project Gutenberg e-books|last=Pegoraro|first=Rob|date=30 November 2010|work=Washington Post|access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough not accessible for years within [[Germany]] to comply with a court order from [[S.

{"title_page": "Transatlantic crossing", "text_new": "{{For|other uses of the term Transatlantic|Transatlantic (disambiguation){{!}}Transatlantic}}\n\n'''Transatlantic crossings''' are passages of passengers and cargo across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[Europe]] or [[Africa]] and the [[Americas]]. The majority of passenger traffic is across the North Atlantic between [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]].  Centuries after the dwindling of sporadic [[Viking]] trade with [[Markland]], a regular and lasting transatlantic [[trade route]] was established in 1566 with the Spanish [[Spanish treasure fleet|West Indies fleets]], following the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]].\n\n== By sea ==\n{{Main|List of crossings of the Atlantic Ocean}}\nPrior to the 19th century, transatlantic crossings were undertaken in [[sailing ship]]s, and the journeys were time-consuming and often perilous. The first trade route across the Atlantic was inaugurated by Spain a few decades after the European [[Discovery of the Americas]], with the establishment of the [[Spanish treasure fleet|West Indies fleets]] in 1566, a convoy system that regularly linked its territories in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Americas]] with Spain for over two centuries. [[Portugal]] created a similar maritime route between its ports in [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] and the Portuguese mainland. Other colonial powers followed, such as [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]], as they colonized the [[New World]].\n\nTransatlantic crossings became faster, safer, and more reliable with the advent of [[steamship]]s in the 19th century.  Grand [[ocean liner]]s began making regularly scheduled crossings, and soon it became a symbol of national and company status to build the largest, fastest, and most luxurious ocean liner for transatlantic crossings. The United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy built the most famous ocean liners.  Examples of some famous transatlantic liners are [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] (had only made one voyage that was unsuccessful due to striking an iceberg),  {{RMS|Lusitania}}, {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|6}}, {{RMS|Olympic}}, {{SS|Rex}}, {{SS|America|1939|6}}, {{SS|United States}}, {{RMS|Queen Mary}}, {{SS|\u00cele de France}}, {{SS|Normandie}}, {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}}, {{SS|France|1961|6}}, ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'', and {{RMS|Queen Mary 2}}.\n\nThe [[Blue Riband]] is awarded for the record fastest crossing by [[transatlantic liner]].  The current eastbound record was set by the American ocean liner ''[[SS United States|United States]]'' in July 1952: the ship made the crossing in  3 days, 10 hours, 40 minutes. ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' has awarded world records to various classes such as luxury liners, sail boats, and rowing boats.  Because of the shape of the continents and the assistance (or resistance) of ocean currents, the Eastbound crossing is quicker than the Westbound crossing.\n\nDuring World War II the transatlantic crossing was very important for the United Kingdom as much of Europe had been taken over by Germany and its allies preventing trade and supplies; the struggle is known as the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\n===Crossings in small vessels===\n\n====Yacht=====\nThe late Tom Gentry set nearly every powerboat speed record in existence. His passion to win power boating's most coveted honor, the Blue Riband for the fastest passage across the Atlantic, drove him to design and build the 112', 11,500 horsepower Gentry Eagle. In 1989, he and a crew of five including his son, Norman Gentry, shattered the transatlantic crossing record and brought the honor back to the United States. Gentry took the Blue Riband away from the British airline and music tycoon Richard Branson. His record setting time of 62 hours & 7 minutes bested Sir Richard Branson's record by an astonishing 23%.\n\n\n====Zodiac====\nIn 1952, [[Alain Bombard]] crossed the Atlantic from East to West, spending 113 days adrift in a [[Zodiac Marine & Pool|Zodiac]], ''L'H\u00e9r\u00e9tique''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bombard|first=Alain|title=The Voyage of the Heretique|date=1953|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}</ref>\n\n====Rafts====\nIn 1956, [[L\u2019\u00c9gar\u00e9 II|Henri Beaudout]] crossed the Atlantic from West to East, from [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], on a raft of wood and rope, ''[[L\u2019\u00c9gar\u00e9 II]]'', in 88 days.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wadden|first=Marie|title=Three Canadians, two kittens, one raft: A little-known journey across the Atlantic|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/three-canadians-two-kittens-one-raft-a-little-known-journey-across-the-atlantic/article4462515/|accessdate=19 May 2014|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=3 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, [[Thor Heyerdahl]] crossed the Atlantic in ''Ra II'', a [[papyrus]] raft built to an [[Ancient Egyptian]] design.

Over the last century sailing has become more popular, and more accessible. What used to be an imposingly vast ocean has turned into an increasingly popular passage for ocean adventure travellers. With modern well-equipped boats, it has become a safer and more feasible undertaking than it was back in the day. Hundreds of sailing yachts make the Atlantic Ocean crossing each year. Most boats travel the North Atlantic starting from Europe to the Caribbean or South America. Some boats make the passage from Africa to the other side. From the Americas, boats mostly go to Europe. Several different routes exist. The most popular route is the North Atlantic circle, driven by the season and trade winds: the Southern route goes from east to west and the Northern route from west to east. A small but increasing number of yachts also make a high latitude voyage like the North West passage or cross the South Atlantic from Africa to Brazil <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoceanpreneur.com/books |website=Oceanpreneur|title=Ocean Nomad: The Atlantic Sailing Crew Guide}}</ref>\n\n=====Transatlantic rowing races=====\n{{Main|Atlantic Rowing Race}}\nIn 1997, the first East\u2013West Atlantic Rowing Race took place, running from the [[Canary Islands]] to the [[Caribbean]]. It now runs once every two years or so.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn 2006, the first West\u2013East North Atlantic Rowing Race took place, running from [[New York City]] to [[Falmouth, Cornwall]] in the [[UK]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Transatlantic flights==\n{{Main|Transatlantic flight}}\nTransatlantic flight surpassed ocean liners as the predominant mode of crossing the Atlantic in the mid 20th century.  In 1919, the American [[NC-4]] became the first [[airplane]] to cross the Atlantic (but in multiple stages). Later that year, a British [[Vickers Vimy]] piloted by [[Alcock and Brown]] made the first non-stop transatlantic flight from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to [[Ireland]]. Also in 1919, the British were the first to cross the Atlantic in an [[airship]] when the [[R33 class airship|R34]] captained by Major George Herbert Scott of the [[Royal Air Force]] with his crew and passengers flew from East Fortune, Scotland  to Mineola, Long Island, covering a distance of about {{convert|3000|smi|km}} in about four and a half days; he then made a return trip to England, thus also completing the first double crossing of the Atlantic (east\u2013west\u2013east). The first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic was made by the Portuguese naval aviators [[Gago Coutinho]] and [[Sacadura Cabral]] in 1922. Coutinho and Cabral flew from [[Lisbon, Portugal]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil in stages, using three different [[Fairey III]] biplanes, and they covered a distance of {{convert|8383|km}} between 30 March and 17 June. The first night-time crossing of the Atlantic was accomplished during 16\u201317 April 1927 by the Portuguese aviators [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Sarmento de Beires|Sarmento de Beires]], Jorge de Castilho and Manuel Gouveia, flying from the [[Bijag\u00f3s Archipelago]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], to [[Fernando de Noronha]], Brazil in the ''Argos'', a [[Dornier Do J|Dornier Wal]] flying boat. In May 1927, [[Charles Lindbergh]] made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between [[New York City]] and [[Paris]]). The second solo piloting, and the first to carry a passenger, was [[Clarence Duncan Chamberlin]] on June 6, 1927. [[Edward R. Armstrong]] proposed a string of anchored \"seadromes\" to refuel planes in a crossing.\n\nThe first serious attempt to take a share of the transatlantic passenger market away from the ocean liners was undertaken by [[Germany]]. In the 1930s, Germany crossed the Atlantic with [[Zeppelin]]s that could carry about 60 passengers in a similar luxurious style to the ocean liners. However, the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] in 1937 put an end to transatlantic Zeppelin flights.\n\nOn June 1, 1944, two [[K class blimp|K-class blimps]] from Blimp Squadron ZP-14 of the [[United States Navy]] (USN) completed the first transatlantic crossing by [[Blimp|non-rigid airships]]. The two K-ships (K-123 and K-130) left [[South Weymouth Naval Air Station|South Weymouth, MA]] on May 28, 1944 and flew approximately 16 hours to [[Naval Station Argentia]], Newfoundland.  From Argentia, the blimps flew approximately 22 hours to [[Lajes Field]] on Terceira Island in the Azores.  The final leg of the first transatlantic crossing was about a 20-hour flight from the Azores to [[Kenitra Airport|Craw Field]] in Port Lyautey ([[Kenitra]]), French [[Morocco]].<ref>Kline, R. C. and Kubarych, S. J., Blimpron 14 Overseas, 1944, Naval Historical Center, Navy Yard, Washington, D. C.</ref><ref>https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/fbd712_4eac320cdad44dd68701e9cecad8e446.pdf</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the predominance of ocean liners began to wane when larger, [[jet engine|jet]]-powered airplanes began carrying passengers across the ocean in less and less time.  The speed of crossing the ocean therefore became more important than the style of crossing it.  The maturing passenger [[Jet Age]] starting with the [[Boeing 707]] reduced the typical crossing time between [[London]] and [[New York City]] to between 6.5 and 8 hours, depending on weather conditions.  By the 1970s, supersonic [[Concorde]] airplanes could connect the two cities in less than 4 hours, and only one ocean liner, ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' remained on the transatlantic route for those who favored the slower style of travel. \n\nThe economics of commercial transatlantic flying have evolved markedly since the 1950s; the introduction of [[Wide-body aircraft|widebody]] airliners (such as the [[Boeing 747]] and [[Douglas DC-10]]) in the early 1970s made affordable transatlantic travel to the masses a reality.  Since the 1990s, the high [[reliability engineering|reliability]] of modern jet engines has meant that twin engine jet aircraft such as the [[Boeing 767]], [[Boeing 777]] and [[Airbus A330]] have largely taken over on transatlantic routes from quad-engine jets, whilst the supersonic Concorde was ultimately doomed by its high running costs, leading to its retirement in 2003.  Since the late 1990s, single aisle, narrow body jet airliners (starting with the [[Boeing 757]], and more recently the latest versions of both the [[Boeing 737 MAX|Boeing 737]] and [[Airbus A320]]) have been used for transatlantic service, meaning that city pairs between major North American hubs and secondary European cities can now be connected directly without the need for larger widebody jets, which were uneconomic on routes with lower passenger demand.\n\n== Transatlantic cables ==\n{{Further|Transatlantic communications cable}}\n\nTransatlantic cables are cables that have been laid along the ocean floor to connect North America and Europe. Before the advent of [[radio]], the only means of communication across the Atlantic Ocean was to physically connect the continents with a [[transatlantic telegraph cable]], the first of which was installed from [[Valentia Island|Valentia]], [[Ireland]] to [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1858. The first transatlantic telephone cable, [[TAT-1]], was installed in 1955.  The first transatlantic fiber optic cable, [[TAT-8]], was installed in 1988. The [[exchange rate]] between the [[United States dollar]] and [[Pound Sterling|British pound]] is still colloquially known as \"cable\" by financial marketeers, from the early use of the transatlantic cable for this purpose.\n\n==Transatlantic radio==\nTransatlantic radio communication was first accomplished on December 12, 1901 by [[Guglielmo Marconi]] who, using a temporary receiving station at [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill, Newfoundland]], received a [[Morse code]] signal representing the letter \"S\" sent from [[Poldhu]], in [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Transmission_of_Transatlantic_Radio_Signals,_1901 |title=Milestones:Transmission of Transatlantic Radio Signals, 1901 |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>  Guglielmo Marconi initiated commercial transatlantic radio communications between his high power long wave wireless telegraphy stations in [[Clifden]] Ireland and [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia]] on 17 October 1907.\n\n[[Amateur radio]] operators are usually credited with the discovery of transatlantic radio communication in the [[shortwave]] bands. The first successful transatlantic tests were conducted by radio amateurs in December 1921 operating in the 200 meter medium-wave band, the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe at 200 meters and at least 20 North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two way transatlantic shortwave radio contacts were completed by radio amateurs in November 1923, on 110 meters.\n\nMarconi initiated the first commercial shortwave transatlantic radio communication between the UK to Canada using his ''[[Imperial Wireless Chain|Beam Wireless Service]]'' which went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926.  Shortwave radio vastly increased the speed and capacity of transatlantic communications at dramatically reduced cost compared to telegraph cable and long wave radio.\n\n[[Telstar]] was the first [[communications satellite]] to provide commercial transatlantic communications. It was launched by on July 10, 1962, the first privately sponsored space launch.  Communications satellites vastly increased the speed and quality of transatlantic communication, but transatlantic [[fiber optic]] cables have carried the vast majority of transatlantic communications traffic since the early 1990s.\n\n== Transatlantic tunnel ==\n{{Main|Transatlantic tunnel}}\nA Transatlantic Tunnel is a theoretical structure proposed several times since the late 19th century.  It would be a [[tunnel]] that spans the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[New York City]] and the [[United Kingdom]] or [[France]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Transatlantic relations]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Fowler Jr., William M.

Over the last century sailing has become more popular, and more accessible. What used to be an imposingly vast ocean has turned into an increasingly popular passage for ocean adventure travellers. With modern well-equipped boats, it has become a safer and more feasible undertaking than it was back in the day. Hundreds of sailing yachts make the Atlantic Ocean crossing each year. Most boats travel the North Atlantic starting from Europe to the Caribbean or South America. Some boats make the passage from Africa to the other side. From the Americas, boats mostly go to Europe. Several different routes exist. The most popular route is the North Atlantic circle, driven by the season and trade winds: the Southern route goes from east to west and the Northern route from west to east. A small but increasing number of yachts also make a high latitude voyage like the North West passage or cross the South Atlantic from Africa to Brazil <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoceanpreneur.com/books |website=Oceanpreneur|title=Ocean Nomad: The Atlantic Sailing Crew Guide}}</ref>\n\n=====Transatlantic rowing races=====\n{{Main|Atlantic Rowing Race}}\nIn 1997, the first East\u2013West Atlantic Rowing Race took place, running from the [[Canary Islands]] to the [[Caribbean]]. It now runs once every two years or so.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn 2006, the first West\u2013East North Atlantic Rowing Race took place, running from [[New York City]] to [[Falmouth, Cornwall]] in the [[UK]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Transatlantic flights==\n{{Main|Transatlantic flight}}\nTransatlantic flight surpassed ocean liners as the predominant mode of crossing the Atlantic in the mid 20th century.  In 1919, the American [[NC-4]] became the first [[airplane]] to cross the Atlantic (but in multiple stages). Later that year, a British [[Vickers Vimy]] piloted by [[Alcock and Brown]] made the first non-stop transatlantic flight from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to [[Ireland]]. Also in 1919, the British were the first to cross the Atlantic in an [[airship]] when the [[R33 class airship|R34]] captained by Major George Herbert Scott of the [[Royal Air Force]] with his crew and passengers flew from East Fortune, Scotland  to Mineola, Long Island, covering a distance of about {{convert|3000|smi|km}} in about four and a half days; he then made a return trip to England, thus also completing the first double crossing of the Atlantic (east\u2013west\u2013east). The first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic was made by the Portuguese naval aviators [[Gago Coutinho]] and [[Sacadura Cabral]] in 1922. Coutinho and Cabral flew from [[Lisbon, Portugal]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil in stages, using three different [[Fairey III]] biplanes, and they covered a distance of {{convert|8383|km}} between 30 March and 17 June. The first night-time crossing of the Atlantic was accomplished during 16\u201317 April 1927 by the Portuguese aviators [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Sarmento de Beires|Sarmento de Beires]], Jorge de Castilho and Manuel Gouveia, flying from the [[Bijag\u00f3s Archipelago]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], to [[Fernando de Noronha]], Brazil in the ''Argos'', a [[Dornier Do J|Dornier Wal]] flying boat. In May of 1927, [[Charles Lindbergh]] made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between [[New York City]] and [[Paris]]). The second solo piloting, and the first to carry a passenger, was [[Clarence Duncan Chamberlin]] on June 6, 1927. [[Edward R. Armstrong]] proposed a string of anchored \"seadromes\" to refuel planes in a crossing.\n\nThe first serious attempt to take a share of the transatlantic passenger market away from the ocean liners was undertaken by [[Germany]]. In the 1930s, Germany crossed the Atlantic with [[Zeppelin]]s that could carry about 60 passengers in a similar luxurious style to the ocean liners. However, the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] in 1937 put an end to transatlantic Zeppelin flights.\n\nOn June 1, 1944, two [[K class blimp|K-class blimps]] from Blimp Squadron ZP-14 of the [[United States Navy]] (USN) completed the first transatlantic crossing by [[Blimp|non-rigid airships]]. The two K-ships (K-123 and K-130) left [[South Weymouth Naval Air Station|South Weymouth, MA]] on May 28, 1944 and flew approximately 16 hours to [[Naval Station Argentia]], Newfoundland.  From Argentia, the blimps flew approximately 22 hours to [[Lajes Field]] on Terceira Island in the Azores.  The final leg of the first transatlantic crossing was about a 20-hour flight from the Azores to [[Kenitra Airport|Craw Field]] in Port Lyautey ([[Kenitra]]), French [[Morocco]].<ref>Kline, R. C. and Kubarych, S. J., Blimpron 14 Overseas, 1944, Naval Historical Center, Navy Yard, Washington, D. C.</ref><ref>https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/fbd712_4eac320cdad44dd68701e9cecad8e446.pdf</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the predominance of ocean liners began to wane when larger, [[jet engine|jet]]-powered airplanes began carrying passengers across the ocean in less and less time.  The speed of crossing the ocean therefore became more important than the style of crossing it.  The maturing passenger [[Jet Age]] starting with the [[Boeing 707]] reduced the typical crossing time between [[London]] and [[New York City]] to between 6.5 and 8 hours, depending on weather conditions.  By the 1970s, supersonic [[Concorde]] airplanes could connect the two cities in less than 4 hours, and only one ocean liner, ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' remained on the transatlantic route for those who favored the slower style of travel. \n\nThe economics of commercial transatlantic flying have evolved markedly since the 1950s; the introduction of [[Wide-body aircraft|widebody]] airliners (such as the [[Boeing 747]] and [[Douglas DC-10]]) in the early 1970s made affordable transatlantic travel to the masses a reality.  Since the 1990s, the high [[reliability engineering|reliability]] of modern jet engines has meant that twin engine jet aircraft such as the [[Boeing 767]], [[Boeing 777]] and [[Airbus A330]] have largely taken over on transatlantic routes from quad-engine jets, whilst the supersonic Concorde was ultimately doomed by its high running costs, leading to its retirement in 2003.  Since the late 1990s, single aisle, narrow body jet airliners (starting with the [[Boeing 757]], and more recently the latest versions of both the [[Boeing 737 MAX|Boeing 737]] and [[Airbus A320]]) have been used for transatlantic service, meaning that city pairs between major North American hubs and secondary European cities can now be connected directly without the need for larger widebody jets, which were uneconomic on routes with lower passenger demand.\n\n== Transatlantic cables ==\n{{Further|Transatlantic communications cable}}\n\nTransatlantic cables are cables that have been laid along the ocean floor to connect North America and Europe. Before the advent of [[radio]], the only means of communication across the Atlantic Ocean was to physically connect the continents with a [[transatlantic telegraph cable]], the first of which was installed from [[Valentia Island|Valentia]], [[Ireland]] to [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1858. The first transatlantic telephone cable, [[TAT-1]], was installed in 1955.  The first transatlantic fiber optic cable, [[TAT-8]], was installed in 1988. The [[exchange rate]] between the [[United States dollar]] and [[Pound Sterling|British pound]] is still colloquially known as \"cable\" by financial marketeers, from the early use of the transatlantic cable for this purpose.\n\n==Transatlantic radio==\nTransatlantic radio communication was first accomplished on December 12, 1901 by [[Guglielmo Marconi]] who, using a temporary receiving station at [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill, Newfoundland]], received a [[Morse code]] signal representing the letter \"S\" sent from [[Poldhu]], in [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Transmission_of_Transatlantic_Radio_Signals,_1901 |title=Milestones:Transmission of Transatlantic Radio Signals, 1901 |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>  Guglielmo Marconi initiated commercial transatlantic radio communications between his high power long wave wireless telegraphy stations in [[Clifden]] Ireland and [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia]] on 17 October 1907.\n\n[[Amateur radio]] operators are usually credited with the discovery of transatlantic radio communication in the [[shortwave]] bands. The first successful transatlantic tests were conducted by radio amateurs in December 1921 operating in the 200 meter medium-wave band, the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe at 200 meters and at least 20 North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two way transatlantic shortwave radio contacts were completed by radio amateurs in November 1923, on 110 meters.\n\nMarconi initiated the first commercial shortwave transatlantic radio communication between the UK to Canada using his ''[[Imperial Wireless Chain|Beam Wireless Service]]'' which went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926.  Shortwave radio vastly increased the speed and capacity of transatlantic communications at dramatically reduced cost compared to telegraph cable and long wave radio.\n\n[[Telstar]] was the first [[communications satellite]] to provide commercial transatlantic communications. It was launched by on July 10, 1962, the first privately sponsored space launch.  Communications satellites vastly increased the speed and quality of transatlantic communication, but transatlantic [[fiber optic]] cables have carried the vast majority of transatlantic communications traffic since the early 1990s.\n\n== Transatlantic tunnel ==\n{{Main|Transatlantic tunnel}}\nA Transatlantic Tunnel is a theoretical structure proposed several times since the late 19th century.  It would be a [[tunnel]] that spans the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[New York City]] and the [[United Kingdom]] or [[France]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Transatlantic relations]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Fowler Jr., William M.
