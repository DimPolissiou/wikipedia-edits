The Ten Commandments appear twice in the [[Hebrew Bible]]: in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Deuteronomy]]. The commandments include instructions to [[Thou shalt have no other gods before me|have no other gods before him]], to [[Honour thy father and thy mother|honour one's parents]], and to [[remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy|keep the sabbath day holy]], as well as prohibitions against [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|idolatry]], [[Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain|blasphemy]], [[Thou shalt not kill|murder]], [[Thou shalt not commit adultery|adultery]], [[Thou shalt not steal|theft]], [[Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour|dishonesty]], and [[Thou shalt not covet|coveting]]. Different religious groups follow different traditions for interpreting and numbering them.\n\nModern scholarship has found likely influences in [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Mesopotamian]] laws and treaties, but is divided over exactly when the Ten Commandments were written and who wrote them.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:4Q41 2.png|right|thumb|320px|alt=The second of two parchment sheets making up 4Q41, it contains Deuteronomy 5:1\u20136:1|Part of the [[All Souls Deuteronomy]], containing the oldest extant copy of the Decalogue.<ref name=\"oldest10comms\">{{cite web\n |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/oldest-complete-copy-of-ten-commandments-goes-on-display-in-israel/\n |title=Oldest complete copy of Ten Commandments goes on display in Israel\n |last=Estrin\n |first=Daniel\n |date=5 May 2015\n |website=www.timesofisrael.com\n |publisher=[[The Times of Israel]]\n |access-date=16 August 2018\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818120125/https://www.timesofisrael.com/oldest-complete-copy-of-ten-commandments-goes-on-display-in-israel/\n |archive-date=18 August 2018\n |url-status=live\n }}</ref> It is dated to the early [[Herodian dynasty|Herodian]] period, between 30 and 1 BC.<ref name=\"Beek\">{{cite book|last=Van Beek|first=Gus Willard|editor=Smithsonian Institution|title=Scrolls from the Wilderness of the Dead Sea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9RxMUGrEzIQC&pg=PA31|year=1965|publisher=University of California Press|page=31|id=GGKEY:DB7ASUBBXXJ|access-date=18 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231191141/http://books.google.com/books?id=9RxMUGrEzIQC&pg=PA31|archive-date=31 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>]]\nIn [[biblical Hebrew]], the Ten Commandments are called {{Hebrew|\u05e2\u05e9\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd}} ([[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] {{lang|he-Latn|aseret ha-d'varim}}) and in [[Mishnaic Hebrew language|Mishnaic Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|\u05e2\u05e9\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea}} (transliterated {{lang|he-Latn|aseret ha-dibrot}}), both translatable as \"the ten words\", \"the ten sayings\", or \"the ten matters\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1WUzUAdWRVUC&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Ten Commandments: Ethics for the Twenty-First Century|first=Mark|last=Rooker|year=2010|publisher=B&H Publishing Group|location=Nashville, Tennessee|page=3|isbn=978-0-8054-4716-3|accessdate=2011-10-02|quote=The Ten Commandments are literally the 'Ten Words' (''\u0103\u015beret hadd\u011bb\u0101r\u00eem'') in Hebrew.

Echoing an earlier rabbinic comment found in the commentary of Rashi to the Songs of Songs (4:5) Ginzberg explained\u2014there is also a great bond of union between the first five commandments and the last five. The first commandment: \"I am the Lord, thy God,\" corresponds to the sixth: \"Thou shalt not kill,\" for the murderer slays the image of God. The second: \"Thou shalt have no strange gods before me,\" corresponds to the seventh: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" for conjugal faithlessness is as grave a sin as idolatry, which is faithlessness to God. The third commandment: \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain,\" corresponds to the eighth: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" for stealing result in false oath in God's name. The fourth: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" corresponds to the ninth: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,\" for he who bears false witness against his neighbor commits as grave a sin as if he had borne false witness against God, saying that He had not created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day (the holy Sabbath). The fifth commandment: \"Honor thy father and thy mother,\" corresponds to the tenth: \"Covet not thy neighbor's wife,\" for one who indulges this lust produces children who will not honor their true father, but will consider a stranger their father.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The Unity of Ten Commandments] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807032722/https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS |date=7 August 2018 }}, (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Rabbinical Jewish belief is that the observance of these commandments and the other ''mitzvot'' are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven [[Noahide laws]], several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments.

The ''ta'am 'elyon'' (upper accentuation), which makes each Commandment into a separate verse, is used for public Torah reading, while the ''ta'am tachton'' (lower accentuation), which divides the text into verses of more even length, is used for private reading or study.

''\"...all which a man loves, for which he leaves everything else but that, is his god, thus the glutton and drunkard has for his idol his own flesh, the fornicator has for his idol the harlot and the greedy has for his idol silver and gold, and so the same for every other sinner.\"''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110826202022/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/arts/barnabas/Barncoloured.html Gospel of Barnabas chapter XXXIII] ''Latrobe Edu''</ref>  Idolatory was thus the basic sin, which manifested in various acts or thoughts, which displace the primacy of God.  However, the Gospel of Barnabas does not form part of the Christian bible.  It is known only from 16th- and 17th-century manuscripts, and frequently reflects Islamic rather than Christian understandings<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne}}</ref>, so it cannot be taken as authoritative on Christian views.\n\nIn Christianity's earliest centuries, some Christians had informally adorned their homes and places of worship with images of Christ and the saints, which others thought inappropriate. No church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons,{{fact|date=February 2020}} and again in the Middle Ages, becoming a critical point of contention in the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 726 [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730 a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787 the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815 [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843 [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.{{fact|date=February 2020}} This mostly settled the matter until the Reformation, when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council \"emanated from Satan\".{{fact|date=February 2020}} Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].{{fact|date=February 2020}} Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible.

Levinson]] argued that this reconstruction assumes a Christian perspective, and dates back to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s polemic against Judaism, which asserted that religions evolve from the more [[ritual]]istic to the more [[ethic]]al. Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at [[Mt. Sinai]] would have emphasized rituals, and that the \"ethical\" Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the [[messiah]]. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of the idea that the [[supersession]] of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.<ref>Levinson, Bernard M.

Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times. This means that there is no longer any ''a priori'' reason to believe that Exodus 20:2\u201317 and Exodus 34:10\u201328 were composed during different stages of Israelite history. For example, critical historian [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] also dates the Jahwist texts to the tenth century BCE, but believes that they express a theology that \"had already been normalized in the period of the Judges\" (i.e., of the tribal alliance).<ref>John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition.

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]],<ref>PCUSA Assembly Committee on General Assembly Procedures D.3.a http://apps.pcusa.org/ga216/business/commbooks/comm03.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[American Jewish Congress]]<ref>American Jewish Congress, \"AJCongress Voices Opposition to Courtroom Display of ten Commandments,\" (May 16, 2003) http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904031027/http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 |date=4 September 2014 }}</ref>), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.\n\nThose who oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property argue that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display of the ten commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge [[Roy Moore]] that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].<ref name=\"moses.creighton.edu\" />\n\n[[File:1 Gebot (Lucas Cranach d A).jpg|thumb|''The Ten Commandments'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the townhall of [[Wittenberg]] (detail)]]\nU.S. courts have often ruled against displays of the Ten Commandments on government property. They conclude that the ten commandments are derived from [[Judeo-Christian]] religions, to the exclusion of others: the statement \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" excludes non-monotheistic religions like [[Hinduism]], for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.\n\nOne result of these legal cases has been that proponents of displaying the Ten Commandments have sometimes surrounded them with other historical texts to portray them as historical, rather than religious. Another result has been that other religious organizations have tried to put monuments to their laws on public lands. For example, an organization called [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in [[Utah]] for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.\n\n==Cultural references==\nTwo famous films with this name were directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]]: a [[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|silent movie which was released in 1923]] and starred [[Theodore Roberts]] as Moses and a colour [[VistaVision]] [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|version which was released in 1956]], and starred [[Charlton Heston]] as Moses.\n\nBoth ''[[Dekalog]]'', a 1989 Polish film series directed by [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]], and ''[[The Ten]]'', a 2007 American film, use the ten commandments as a structure for 10 smaller stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/|title=The Ten|accessdate=8 April 2020|via=www.imdb.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307211234/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/|archive-date=7 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe receipt of the Ten Commandments by Moses was satirized in [[Mel Brooks]]'s movie ''[[History of the World Part I]]'' (1981), which shows Moses (played by Brooks, in a similar costume to [[Charlton Heston]]'s Moses in the [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|1956 film]]), receiving three tablets containing fifteen commandments, but before he can present them to his people, he stumbles and drops one of the tablets, shattering it.

Echoing an earlier rabbinic comment found in the commentary of Rashi to the Songs of Songs (4:5) Ginzberg explained\u2014there is also a great bond of union between the first five commandments and the last five. The first commandment: \"I am the Lord, thy God,\" corresponds to the sixth: \"Thou shalt not kill,\" for the murderer slays the image of God. The second: \"Thou shalt have no strange gods before me,\" corresponds to the seventh: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" for conjugal faithlessness is as grave a sin as idolatry, which is faithlessness to God. The third commandment: \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain,\" corresponds to the eighth: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" for stealing result in false oath in God's name. The fourth: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" corresponds to the ninth: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,\" for he who bears false witness against his neighbor commits as grave a sin as if he had borne false witness against God, saying that He had not created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day (the holy Sabbath). The fifth commandment: \"Honor thy father and thy mother,\" corresponds to the tenth: \"Covet not thy neighbor's wife,\" for one who indulges this lust produces children who will not honor their true father, but will consider a stranger their father.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The Unity of Ten Commandments] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807032722/https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS |date=7 August 2018 }}, (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Rabbinical Jewish belief is that the observance of these commandments and the other ''mitzvot'' are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven [[Noahide laws]], several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments.

The ''ta'am 'elyon'' (upper accentuation), which makes each Commandment into a separate verse, is used for public Torah reading, while the ''ta'am tachton'' (lower accentuation), which divides the text into verses of more even length, is used for private reading or study.

No church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons,{{fact|date=February 2020}} and again in the Middle Ages, becoming a critical point of contention in the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 726 [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730 a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787 the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815 [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843 [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.{{fact|date=February 2020}} This mostly settled the matter until the Reformation, when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council \"emanated from Satan\".{{fact|date=February 2020}} Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].{{fact|date=February 2020}} Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible.

Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at [[Mt. Sinai]] would have emphasized rituals, and that the \"ethical\" Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the [[messiah]]. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of the idea that the [[supersession]] of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.<ref>Levinson, Bernard M. (July 2002). \"Goethe's Analysis of Exodus 34 and Its Influence on Julius Wellhausen: the Pfropfung of the Documentary Hypothesis\".

Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times. This means that there is no longer any ''a priori'' reason to believe that Exodus 20:2\u201317 and Exodus 34:10\u201328 were composed during different stages of Israelite history. For example, critical historian [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] also dates the Jahwist texts to the tenth century BCE, but believes that they express a theology that \"had already been normalized in the period of the Judges\" (i.e., of the tribal alliance).<ref>John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition.

The Decalogue, he argues, was modelled on the suzerainty treaties of the [[Hittites]] (and other Mesopotamian Empires), that is, represents the relationship between God and Israel as a relationship between king and vassal, and enacts that bond.<ref>John Bright, 1972, p., 146\u2013147 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&lpg=PA146&dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false 4th ed. p.150\u2013151] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428085746/https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&lpg=PA146&dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=28 April 2016 }}</ref>\n\n\"The prologue of the Hittite treaty reminds his vassals of his benevolent acts..

It is likely to be an independent document, which was inserted here by the Redactor.\"<ref>Friedman, p. 153</ref> In his view, the [[Covenant Code]] follows that version of the Ten Commandments in the northern Israel E narrative. In the J narrative in Exodus 34 the editor of the combined story known as the Redactor (or RJE), adds in an explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets which were shattered. \"In the combined JE text, it would be awkward to picture God just commanding Moses to make some tablets, as if there were no history to this matter, so RJE adds the explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets that were shattered.\"<ref>Friedman, p. 177</ref>\n\nHe writes that Exodus 34:14\u201326 is the J text of the Ten Commandments: \"The first two commandments and the sabbath commandment have parallels in the other versions of the Ten Commandments.

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]],<ref>PCUSA Assembly Committee on General Assembly Procedures D.3.a http://apps.pcusa.org/ga216/business/commbooks/comm03.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[American Jewish Congress]]<ref>American Jewish Congress, \"AJCongress Voices Opposition to Courtroom Display of ten Commandments,\" (May 16, 2003) http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904031027/http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 |date=4 September 2014 }}</ref>), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.\n\nThose who oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property argue that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display of the ten commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge [[Roy Moore]] that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].<ref name=\"moses.creighton.edu\" />\n\n[[File:1 Gebot (Lucas Cranach d A).jpg|thumb|''The Ten Commandments'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the townhall of [[Wittenberg]] (detail)]]\nU.S. courts have often ruled against displays of the Ten Commandments on government property. They conclude that the ten commandments are derived from [[Judeo-Christian]] religions, to the exclusion of others: the statement \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" excludes non-monotheistic religions like [[Hinduism]], for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.\n\nOne result of these legal cases has been that proponents of displaying the Ten Commandments have sometimes surrounded them with other historical texts to portray them as historical, rather than religious. Another result has been that other religious organizations have tried to put monuments to their laws on public lands. For example, an organization called [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in [[Utah]] for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.\n\n==Cultural references==\nTwo famous films with this name were directed by [[Cecil B.
