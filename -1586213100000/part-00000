{"title_page": "Window film", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Tinted windows|the musical group|Tinted Windows (band)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2012}}\n\n'''Window film''' is a thin laminate film that can be installed to the interior or exterior of glass surfaces in automobiles and boats and also to the interior or exterior of glass in homes and buildings. It is usually made from [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET), a thermoplastic polymer resin of the [[polyester]] family, due to its clarity, tensile strength, dimensional stability, and ability to accept a variety of surface-applied or embedded treatments.\n\nWindow films are generically categorised by their construction components (dyed, pigmented, metallized, ceramic or nano), by their intended use (automotive, marine or architectural), by substrate type (glass or [[polycarbonate]]), and/or by their technical performance (privacy, solar control, safety and security).\n\nWindow film is normally installed by professional service companies but there are also DIY kits widely available.\n\nThe International Window Film Association, founded in 1991, provides unbranded information about window films.<ref>{{cite web|title=IWAF Website|url=http://www.iwfa.com/|website=International Window Film Association|publisher=International Window Film Association|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\nThere are many different grades, shades, colours, and thicknesses of available window films built to offer solutions to a variety of challenges. Window films are a retrofit upgrade for existing glass that can be used to address  problems inherent to glazing, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/windows.php|title=Windows and Glazing - WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=www.wbdg.org}}</ref>\n* heat and glare reduction\n* thermal insulation\n* UV filtration\n* safety and security\n* privacy\n* decoration, signage and branding\n* protection from [[graffiti]].\n*Automotive styling\n\nWindow films are an extremely cost-effective method to reduce heating and cooling costs in existing buildings by reducing the amount of heat transfer through glazing.<ref name=\"Energy Saving\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iwfa.com/Portals/0/PDFDocs/IWFA%20Energy%20Study%20FINAL.pdf |title=Window Films and Energy Saving |date=7 February 2012 |publisher=International Window Film Association }}</ref>\n\n==Primary properties==\n[[File:CIT Building Herndon Va.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The colorful film on these windows gives the building a unique appearance while providing privacy and insulation from the sun.]]\nHeat rejection films are normally applied to the interior of flat glass windows to reduce the amount of [[infrared]], [[Visible spectrum|visible light]], and [[ultraviolet]] (UV) [[radiation]] entering windows. Such films are usually dyed or metalized (which can be transparent to visible light) to convert incoming [[solar radiation]] to infrared radiation, which is then rejected back through the glass to the exterior. Modern window film technology has created ceramic window films which are non-metallic and do not contain dyes that can result in discoloration. The ceramic and metallic window films usually cost 50-100+  percent more than regular window film but can reduce energy transmission by as much as 80 percent.<ref name=\"DOE\">[http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/windows_doors_skylights/index.cfm/mytopic=13430 Your Home: Low-emissivity Window Glazing or Glass]. ''A Consumer's Guide to Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy''. United States Department of Energy Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.</ref>  Ceramic window films cost slightly more but provide a substantial increase by reflecting and absorbing Infrared radiation (radiant heat).\n\nTo keep the sun's heat out of the house, a low-emissivity coating should be applied to the outside pane of [[Insulated glazing|glazed windows]]. If the windows are designed to provide heat energy in the winter and keep heat inside the house (typical of cold climates), the low-emissivity coating should be applied to the inside pane of glazed windows. Such films also reduce the amount of visible and ultraviolet radiation entering a window, and are often applied to reduce fading of the contents of a room. Silvered film may also be employed to the same end. Spectrally selective films act by blocking certain wavelengths of the sun's infrared radiation and reject heat without reducing natural light.\n\nSecurity films are applied to glass so when the glass is broken it holds together, preventing dangerous shards from flying about, or to make it more difficult for an intruder to gain entry. Typically applied to commercial glass, these films are made of heavy-gauge plastic and are intended to maintain the integrity of glass when subject to heavy [[Impact force|impact]]. The most robust security films are capable of preventing fragmentation and the production of hazardous glass [[wikt:shard|shards]] from forces such as [[bomb]] blasts. Some companies have even experimented with bullet ballistics and multiple layers of security film.<ref name=\"FEMA\">\"[http://www.fema.gov/txt/plan/prevent/rms/428/FEMA428_ch6.txt Safe Rooms Within Schools].\" Federal Emergency Management Agency, United States Department of Homeland Security.</ref>  Another key application for security window films (safety window films) is on large areas of \"flat glass\" such as storefront windows, sliding glass doors, and larger windows that are prone to hurricane damage. These security films, if applied properly, can also provide protection for vehicles.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} These security films are often tinted and can be up to 400 [[Micrometre|micrometers]] (\u00b5m) thick, compared to less than 50&nbsp;\u00b5m for ordinary tint films. If anchored correctly, they can also provide protection for architectural glazing in the event of an explosion. A layer of film (of 100&nbsp;\u00b5m thickness or greater) can prevent the ejection of [[spall]] when a projectile impacts on its surface, which otherwise creates small dagger-like shards of glass that can cause injury.\n\nSwitchable films can be switched from opaque to clear by a safe voltage under 36V AC. In its opaque state, it can be perfectly used as a projection screen that is viewable from both sides. 3G switchable film also has UV (100%) and IR (94%) blocking functions and security function.\n\nGraphic design films are generally colored vinyl or frosted. Frosted finish films closely resemble [[sandblasting|sandblasted]] or [[Etching|acid-etched]] glass, while vinyl films are available in a range of colors. Both types of films are commonly used in commercial applications.\n\nPrivacy films reduce visibility through the glass. Privacy film for flat-glass commercial and residential applications may be silvered, offering an unimpeded view from the low-light side but virtually no view from the high-light side. It may also be frosted, rendering the window [[Transparency (optics)|translucent]] but not transparent. Privacy films for automobiles are available in [[gradient]]s of darkness, with the darker tints commonly known as \"limo tint.\"\n\nCorrectly applied mirror film can create [[one-way mirror]]s. Note that in order to be effective the light differential must be from 6 to 10 times greater to maintain the intended performance.  For example, the buildings in a city, during the daytime are difficult to see into, at night however, they can be seen in with ease and if a light is on in the interior space it is easily seen along with the contents.\n\nOther benefits include protection for passengers in the rear of automobiles, protection from UV rays (which have some [[Ultraviolet#Harmful effects|harmful effects]]), cooling for pets, greater [[privacy]], reduced chance of theft (because valuables are less visible), reduced [[Glare (vision)|glare]] and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] on [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD) screens, and protection for those who have conditions involving [[photosensitivity]] or skin sensitivity, such as [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]] (SLE). Window film is also considered more effective and practical than stick-on blinds.\n\n=== UV filtering to reduce fading ===\n\nProtection from UV light can be accomplished by film that addresses only the UV spectrum. As UV is one of the main sources of fading,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/buildings/basics/windows/fading.htm|title=UV Transmittance and Fading|website=www.fsec.ucf.edu}}</ref> it can prolong the life of fixtures and fittings. Basic colorless clear films reject (absorbs) some UV radiation up to 380&nbsp;nm, and depending on the manufacturer, UV inhibitors are added to the polyester, with specialist films offering protection to 400&nbsp;nm. Tinted films are necessary for protection to 500&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kylonusa.com/technology/|title=Technology - Kylon Window Tinting Films|website=kylonusa.com}}</ref>\n\nWindow films filter out over 99% of UV rays to 380&nbsp;nm, reducing the main factor in fading. However, additional factors such as solar heat, visible light, humidity, and presence or absence of chemical vapors also contribute to fading. Therefore, the greatest protection from fading is offered by tinted or metallised window films that reject large levels of heat and visible light, in addition to UV.\n\n== Selection of window film ==\n\nNot all films are suitable for all glass. The absorptance of the glass and the film, the size of the pane, the thickness of the glass, the construction of the window should be considered in terms of single pane, insulated glass, treated (with a low-emissivity coating), laminated or toughened.\n\nAdvice on the appropriate selection of film for the glass is vital to ensure that the glass does not crack as a result of thermal stress. However, it is possible that a pane of glass may break subsequent to the application of an appropriate film, because the pane has been damaged during the glazing of the window, or as a result of movement of the building or other physical stresses that are not apparent at the time of the application of the film.\n\nGlass may crack subsequent to the application of sign writing or if heavy, thermally efficient drapes are hung close to the glass, particularly if the edges of the glass are damaged.\n\nThe chances of glass breakage occurring subsequent to the application of film or sign writing or the hanging of drapes, are very small. However breakage can occur and it is impossible to predict the edge condition of the glass without removing it from the frame \u2013 an approach that is not practical.\n\n===Thermal properties===\n[[HVAC|Heating and cooling]] systems have energy costs, and window films can be used to increase [[building insulation]].\nModern windows with [[Solar heat gain|low-solar-gain]] glass do not need retrofit films, but since most of the existing windows do not have a low [[solar heat gain]], window films make a lot of sense as a retrofit energy improvement.<ref>[http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/energy-efficient-window-treatments \" Energy efficient window treatments \"]; Energy.gov</ref> They can provide thermal comfort and are one of the most cost-competitive and environmentally-friendly energy improvements, especially in hot and mixed climates.\n\n== Unintended features ==\n\nUnder certain conditions, window film will exhibit [[iridescence]] also known as Thin film Interference (TFI) and is well known in the Aviation industry. This phenomenon usually occurs at night, when the source of illumination within a building is fluorescent lighting. The amount of iridescence may vary from almost imperceptible to very visible. It most frequently occurs when the film is constructed with scratch resistance protection. When iridescence does occur in window film, the best way to stop it is to prevent the fluorescent light from illuminating the film or to use an alternative type of light.\n\n==Building use==\nWindow tints can be used in applications like shopfront windows, office block windows, and house windows. This is often done to increase privacy, and decrease heating and cooling costs. Window tints are used in some [[energy efficient buildings]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Window Film and Energy Efficient Buildings video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EZps46gK24|publisher=EWFA, the European Window Film Association|via=Youtube}}</ref>\n\nWindow films are also used to apply [[see-through graphics]] to glass and other transparent surfaces, to provide advertising, branding, signage and decoration. See-through graphics are most commonly applied using a perforated window film with a graphic visible from one side but not the other side, which remains see-though. [[Vehicle wrap advertising|Vehicle wraps]] on buses are perhaps the widest application of see-through graphics.\n\n== Certification and standards ==\n\nThe thicker window films known as [[safety and security window film]] are designed to perform under extreme conditions, and as such there are specific standard criteria these films should meet, such as American standards [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Z.97, [[Consumer Product Safety Commission|CPSC]] 16 CFR 1201, Cat II (400&nbsp;ft-lb), and the [[British Standards]] BS 6206 (Class A, B, C).  The [[European Committee for Standardization]] offer the EN12600 standard Classification of Resistance of Glazing to Impact. Often, building codes dictate that a film must have a report verifying that it has met at least one of these standards.\n\nSolar window film is usually subject to less critical testing. However, standards are in place to maintain a level of quality in the industry. The ANSI Standards ASTM E903 and ASTM D1044-93 relate to the solar/UV transmission properties and abrasion resistance, respectively. The larger window film manufacturers use these standards to guarantee the quality of their raw materials and finished products.\n\n== Regulations for automotive use ==\n[[File:Window tint car.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Window tint on a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] in America. Tint on the front window is lighter than on the back window because of window tint laws.]]\n[[File:CRASH2-24-09 001.jpg|right|thumb|Photo of vehicle with illegal window tint being measured at 2% light transmittance.|230px]]\nAutomobile window tinting reduces the \"Visible Light Transmission\" (VLT) through car windows. This can be problematic at night, or when [[Driving|motorists]] must be able to see through the windows of other vehicles in order to spot hazards. Police also may want to be able to identify the passengers or any potential threat inside a vehicle. Therefore, in many [[jurisdiction]]s, there are laws to restrict the darkness of tinting.\n\n=== Factory tint ===\n\"[[Factory tint]]\", done at the time of manufacture is generally not an applied film, but instead is done by dyeing the inside of the glass with a darkened pigment during glass manufacturing, an electrical process known as \"deep dipping.\" The pigment gives the glass a tint, but doesn't provide UV ray protection or heat rejection like most window films do. The average VLT of factory tint is between 15\u201326%.\n\n=== Regulation by country ===\n* '''Australia'''\u2014 In [[New South Wales]], the [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] permits VLT of 35% on windows other than the windscreen. Tint on the windscreen \u2013 a band across the top is permitted with a depth of no more than 10% of the depth of the windscreen.

It is usually made from [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET), a thermoplastic polymer resin of the [[polyester]] family, due to its clarity, tensile strength, dimensional stability, and ability to accept a variety of surface-applied or embedded treatments.\n\nWindow films are generically categorised by their construction components (dyed, pigmented, metallized, ceramic or nano), by their intended use (automotive, marine or architectural), by substrate type (glass or [[polycarbonate]]), and/or by their technical performance (privacy, solar control, safety and security).\n\nWindow film is normally installed by professional service companies but there are also DIY kits widely available.\n\nThe International Window Film Association, founded in 1991, provides unbranded information about window films.<ref>{{cite web|title=IWAF Website|url=http://www.iwfa.com/|website=International Window Film Association|publisher=International Window Film Association|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\nThere are many different grades, shades, colours, and thicknesses of available window films built to offer solutions to a variety of challenges. Window films are a retrofit upgrade for existing glass that can be used to address  problems inherent to glazing, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/windows.php|title=Windows and Glazing - WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=www.wbdg.org}}</ref>\n* heat and glare reduction\n* thermal insulation\n* UV filtration\n* safety and security\n* privacy\n* decoration, signage and branding\n* protection from [[graffiti]].\n*Automotive styling\n\nWindow films are an extremely cost-effective method to reduce heating and cooling costs in existing buildings by reducing the amount of heat transfer through glazing.<ref name=\"Energy Saving\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iwfa.com/Portals/0/PDFDocs/IWFA%20Energy%20Study%20FINAL.pdf |title=Window Films and Energy Saving |date=7 February 2012 |publisher=International Window Film Association }}</ref>\n\n==Primary properties==\n[[File:CIT Building Herndon Va.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The colorful film on these windows gives the building a unique appearance while providing privacy and insulation from the sun.]]\nHeat rejection films are normally applied to the interior of flat glass windows to reduce the amount of [[infrared]], [[Visible spectrum|visible light]], and [[ultraviolet]] (UV) [[radiation]] entering windows. Such films are usually dyed or metalized (which can be transparent to visible light) to convert incoming [[solar radiation]] to infrared radiation, which is then rejected back through the glass to the exterior. Modern window film technology has created ceramic window films which are non-metallic and do not contain dyes that can result in discoloration. The ceramic and metallic window films usually cost 50-100+  percent more than regular window film but can reduce energy transmission by as much as 80 percent.<ref name=\"DOE\">[http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/windows_doors_skylights/index.cfm/mytopic=13430 Your Home: Low-emissivity Window Glazing or Glass]. ''A Consumer's Guide to Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy''. United States Department of Energy Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.</ref>  Ceramic window films cost slightly more but provide a substantial increase by reflecting and absorbing Infrared radiation (radiant heat).\n\nTo keep the sun's heat out of the house, a low-emissivity coating should be applied to the outside pane of [[Insulated glazing|glazed windows]]. If the windows are designed to provide heat energy in the winter and keep heat inside the house (typical of cold climates), the low-emissivity coating should be applied to the inside pane of glazed windows. Such films also reduce the amount of visible and ultraviolet radiation entering a window, and are often applied to reduce fading of the contents of a room. Silvered film may also be employed to the same end. Spectrally selective films act by blocking certain wavelengths of the sun's infrared radiation and reject heat without reducing natural light.\n\nSecurity films are applied to glass so when the glass is broken it holds together, preventing dangerous shards from flying about, or to make it more difficult for an intruder to gain entry. Typically applied to commercial glass, these films are made of heavy-gauge plastic and are intended to maintain the integrity of glass when subject to heavy [[Impact force|impact]]. The most robust security films are capable of preventing fragmentation and the production of hazardous glass [[wikt:shard|shards]] from forces such as [[bomb]] blasts. Some companies have even experimented with bullet ballistics and multiple layers of security film.<ref name=\"FEMA\">\"[http://www.fema.gov/txt/plan/prevent/rms/428/FEMA428_ch6.txt Safe Rooms Within Schools].\" Federal Emergency Management Agency, United States Department of Homeland Security.</ref>  Another key application for security window films (safety window films) is on large areas of \"flat glass\" such as storefront windows, sliding glass doors, and larger windows that are prone to hurricane damage. These security films, if applied properly, can also provide protection for vehicles.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} These security films are often tinted and can be up to 400 [[Micrometre|micrometers]] (\u00b5m) thick, compared to less than 50&nbsp;\u00b5m for ordinary tint films. If anchored correctly, they can also provide protection for architectural glazing in the event of an explosion. A layer of film (of 100&nbsp;\u00b5m thickness or greater) can prevent the ejection of [[spall]] when a projectile impacts on its surface, which otherwise creates small dagger-like shards of glass that can cause injury.\n\nSwitchable films can be switched from opaque to clear by a safe voltage under 36V AC. In its opaque state, it can be perfectly used as a projection screen that is viewable from both sides. 3G switchable film also has UV (100%) and IR (94%) blocking functions and security function.\n\nGraphic design films are generally colored vinyl or frosted. Frosted finish films closely resemble [[sandblasting|sandblasted]] or [[Etching|acid-etched]] glass, while vinyl films are available in a range of colors. Both types of films are commonly used in commercial applications.\n\nPrivacy films reduce visibility through the glass. Privacy film for flat-glass commercial and residential applications may be silvered, offering an unimpeded view from the low-light side but virtually no view from the high-light side. It may also be frosted, rendering the window [[Transparency (optics)|translucent]] but not transparent. Privacy films for automobiles are available in [[gradient]]s of darkness, with the darker tints commonly known as \"limo tint.\"\n\nCorrectly applied mirror film can create [[one-way mirror]]s. Note that in order to be effective the light differential must be from 6 to 10 times greater to maintain the intended performance.  For example, the buildings in a city, during the daytime are difficult to see into, at night however, they can be seen in with ease and if a light is on in the interior space it is easily seen along with the contents.\n\nOther benefits include protection for passengers in the rear of automobiles, protection from UV rays (which have some [[Ultraviolet#Harmful effects|harmful effects]]), cooling for pets, greater [[privacy]], reduced chance of theft (because valuables are less visible), reduced [[Glare (vision)|glare]] and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] on [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD) screens, and protection for those who have conditions involving [[photosensitivity]] or skin sensitivity, such as [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]] (SLE). Window film is also considered more effective and practical than stick-on blinds.\n\n=== UV filtering to reduce fading ===\n\nProtection from UV light can be accomplished by film that addresses only the UV spectrum. As UV is one of the main sources of fading,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/buildings/basics/windows/fading.htm|title=UV Transmittance and Fading|website=www.fsec.ucf.edu}}</ref> it can prolong the life of fixtures and fittings. Basic colorless clear films reject (absorbs) some UV radiation up to 380&nbsp;nm, and depending on the manufacturer, UV inhibitors are added to the polyester, with specialist films offering protection to 400&nbsp;nm. Tinted films are necessary for protection to 500&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kylonusa.com/technology/|title=Technology - Kylon Window Tinting Films|website=kylonusa.com}}</ref>\n\nWindow films filter out over 99% of UV rays to 380&nbsp;nm, reducing the main factor in fading. However, additional factors such as solar heat, visible light, humidity, and presence or absence of chemical vapors also contribute to fading. Therefore, the greatest protection from fading is offered by tinted or metallised window films that reject large levels of heat and visible light, in addition to UV.\n\n== Selection of window film ==\n\nNot all films are suitable for all glass. The absorptance of the glass and the film, the size of the pane, the thickness of the glass, the construction of the window should be considered in terms of single pane, insulated glass, treated (with a low-emissivity coating), laminated or toughened.\n\nAdvice on the appropriate selection of film for the glass is vital to ensure that the glass does not crack as a result of thermal stress. However, it is possible that a pane of glass may break subsequent to the application of an appropriate film, because the pane has been damaged during the glazing of the window, or as a result of movement of the building or other physical stresses that are not apparent at the time of the application of the film.\n\nGlass may crack subsequent to the application of sign writing or if heavy, thermally efficient drapes are hung close to the glass, particularly if the edges of the glass are damaged.\n\nThe chances of glass breakage occurring subsequent to the application of film or sign writing or the hanging of drapes, are very small. However breakage can occur and it is impossible to predict the edge condition of the glass without removing it from the frame \u2013 an approach that is not practical.\n\n===Thermal properties===\n[[HVAC|Heating and cooling]] systems have energy costs, and window films can be used to increase [[building insulation]].\nModern windows with [[Solar heat gain|low-solar-gain]] glass do not need retrofit films, but since most of the existing windows do not have a low [[solar heat gain]], window films make a lot of sense as a retrofit energy improvement.<ref>[http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/energy-efficient-window-treatments \" Energy efficient window treatments \"]; Energy.gov</ref> They can provide thermal comfort and are one of the most cost-competitive and environmentally-friendly energy improvements, especially in hot and mixed climates.\n\n== Unintended features ==\n\nUnder certain conditions, window film will exhibit [[iridescence]] also known as Thin film Interference (TFI) and is well known in the Aviation industry. This phenomenon usually occurs at night, when the source of illumination within a building is fluorescent lighting. The amount of iridescence may vary from almost imperceptible to very visible. It most frequently occurs when the film is constructed with scratch resistance protection. When iridescence does occur in window film, the best way to stop it is to prevent the fluorescent light from illuminating the film or to use an alternative type of light.\n\n==Building use==\nWindow tints can be used in applications like shopfront windows, office block windows, and house windows. This is often done to increase privacy, and decrease heating and cooling costs. Window tints are used in some [[energy efficient buildings]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Window Film and Energy Efficient Buildings video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EZps46gK24|publisher=EWFA, the European Window Film Association|via=Youtube}}</ref>\n\nWindow films are also used to apply [[see-through graphics]] to glass and other transparent surfaces, to provide advertising, branding, signage and decoration. See-through graphics are most commonly applied using a perforated window film with a graphic visible from one side but not the other side, which remains see-though. [[Vehicle wrap advertising|Vehicle wraps]] on buses are perhaps the widest application of see-through graphics.\n\n== Certification and standards ==\n\nThe thicker window films known as [[safety and security window film]] are designed to perform under extreme conditions, and as such there are specific standard criteria these films should meet, such as American standards [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Z.97, [[Consumer Product Safety Commission|CPSC]] 16 CFR 1201, Cat II (400&nbsp;ft-lb), and the [[British Standards]] BS 6206 (Class A, B, C).  The [[European Committee for Standardization]] offer the EN12600 standard Classification of Resistance of Glazing to Impact. Often, building codes dictate that a film must have a report verifying that it has met at least one of these standards.\n\nSolar window film is usually subject to less critical testing. However, standards are in place to maintain a level of quality in the industry. The ANSI Standards ASTM E903 and ASTM D1044-93 relate to the solar/UV transmission properties and abrasion resistance, respectively. The larger window film manufacturers use these standards to guarantee the quality of their raw materials and finished products.\n\n== Regulations for automotive use ==\n[[File:Window tint car.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Window tint on a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] in America. Tint on the front window is lighter than on the back window because of window tint laws.]]\n[[File:CRASH2-24-09 001.jpg|right|thumb|Photo of vehicle with illegal window tint being measured at 2% light transmittance.|230px]]\nAutomobile window tinting reduces the \"Visible Light Transmission\" (VLT) through car windows. This can be problematic at night, or when [[Driving|motorists]] must be able to see through the windows of other vehicles in order to spot hazards. Police also may want to be able to identify the passengers or any potential threat inside a vehicle. Therefore, in many [[jurisdiction]]s, there are laws to restrict the darkness of tinting.\n\n=== Factory tint ===\n\"[[Factory tint]]\", done at the time of manufacture is generally not an applied film, but instead is done by dyeing the inside of the glass with a darkened pigment during glass manufacturing, an electrical process known as \"deep dipping.\" The pigment gives the glass a tint, but doesn't provide UV ray protection or heat rejection like most window films do. The average VLT of factory tint is between 15\u201326%.\n\n=== Regulation by country ===\n* '''Australia'''\u2014 In [[New South Wales]], the [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] permits VLT of 35% on windows other than the windscreen. Tint on the windscreen \u2013 a band across the top is permitted with a depth of no more than 10% of the depth of the windscreen. An exception to the side & rear window tinting regulations applies to cars tinted before 1 August 1994.<ref>\n[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/registration/downloads/vsi/vsi03_rev3.pdf rta.nsw.gov.au] Vehicle Standards Information - Windscreens and window tinting</ref>\n* '''Belarus'''\u2014 Any kind of window tint is illegal.

This trend has continued with many players representing New Zealand in two sports or representing two different countries in rugby league due to the eligibility rules in place at the time. For example, [[Dally Messenger]] represented Australia in both rugby union and rugby league as well as playing with the 1907 touring side.\n\nOf the 36 players that have played for both the Kiwis and the [[All Blacks]], only [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Sonny Bill Williams]]  have been a Kiwi before they became an All Black.\n\nAs well as the dual internationals below, [[Charles Savory]] won the New Zealand National Amateur Heavyweight Boxing championship in 1914, [[Sonny Bill Williams]] won the [[New Zealand Professional Boxing Association]] Heavyweight Championship in 2012 and Kiwis captain [[Puti Tipene Watene|Puti Tipene (Steve) Watene]] became a [[Member of Parliament]] after his retirement from rugby league.<ref name=akl100>Coffey, John and Bernie Wood ''Auckland, 100 years of rugby league, 1909-2009'', 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-86969-366-4}}, p.46</ref>\n\nFour Kiwis have gone on to be test referees; [[Albert House]], [[Maurice Wetherill]], [[Vic Belsham]] and [[Henry Perenara]].<ref>[http://www.nzrl.co.nz/media/63553/in%20touch%20nov%20dec%202011.pdf In Touch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114025947/http://www.nzrl.co.nz/media/63553/in%20touch%20nov%20dec%202011.pdf |date=14 January 2015 }} ''New Zealand Rugby League'', December 2011</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n!width=\"100\"|Country!!width=\"80\"|Sport!!width=\"50\"|No.!!Players\n|-\n|[[All Blacks|New Zealand]]||rugby union||37||[[Albert Asher]], [[Frano Botica]], [[Alphonsus Carroll]], [[Bert Cooke (rugby)|Bert Cooke]], [[Tom Cross (rugby)|Tom Cross]], [[Marc Ellis (rugby)|Marc Ellis]], [[David Evans (rugby)|Dave Evans]], [[Charles Fitzgerald (rugby)|Charles Fitzgerald]], [[Arthur Francis (rugby)|Arthur Francis]], [[George A.

[[Claude-Jean Allouez]], S.J., established the Ste-Marie-des-Lacs mission on the south shore of the St. Mary's lake, in order to serve the local [[Potawatomi]] tribe along with French trappers and settlers in the area. The French Catholic missionaries were expelled by the British from the area following the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763, but in 1832 Ste-Marie-des-Lacs was re-established by [[Stephen Badin]] and the [[Log Chapel (University of Notre Dame)]] was built. \n\n===The first church===\nWhen Rev. [[Edward Sorin]], C.S.C., established the University of Notre Dame, the community held religious services in the small log cabin built by Stephen Badin. This was replaced by a larger log cabin between 1842 and 1843.   \n[[File:Sacred Heart basilica, Interior 4.jpg|left|thumb|330x330px|Nave and vaulted ceiling]]The growth of the institution required a proper church, and school leaders decided to spend $1500 to construct a new edifice. Work began on 25 May 1848, and the structure was dedicated on 12 November of the following year. The solemn consecration took place a year later, on 11 November 1849, with [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vincennes, Indiana|Bishop of Vincennes]], [[Jacques-Maurice De Saint Palais|Maurice de St. Palais]] presiding.<ref>{{cite web| title=Notre Dame \u2014 One Hundred Years: Chapter V| url=http://archives.nd.edu/hope/hope05.htm| first=Arthur J.| last=Hope, C.S.C.| publisher=University of Notre Dame|\n year=1999}}</ref> Father Sorin describes the first church: \"The style is Greek, with rounded arches. There are three vaults and six columns which produce a very pretty effect. The tribune, which has been built for the use of the Sisters, is elliptical like the sanctuary. It is already enriched with an organ of Mr. H. Erben, and, though a little weak for the church, is one of its most precious ornaments.\"<ref>16 Sorin, ''Chronicle'', 84-85.</ref>\n\nShortly after the completion of the church, the university added a bell to its tower. In the spring of 1851, the wind swept tower and bell to the ground. That summer, university leaders purchased a larger bell in Cincinnati weighing {{convert|3220|lb|kg}} and installed it in one of the church towers after it was blessed on the feast of the Assumption. In 1852 double spires were built by a local carpenter in exchange for his son's tuition at the school.<ref>{{cite web |title=Basilica of the Sacred Heart is the heart of Indiana's University of Notre Dame campus |url=https://www.midwestguest.com/2010/12/basilica-of-the-sacred-heart-is-the-heart-of-indianas-university-of-notre-dame-campus.html |website=Midwest Guest |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===The second (and present) church===\nThe University's needs soon outgrew the small first church and in spring of 1869 the leaders decided to build a new church dedicated to Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, despite the lack of funds in the school's treasury.  [[File:Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Notre Dame, Indiana) - interior, vault.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ceiling of the nave|275x275px]]\n\nPopular architect [[Patrick Keely]] drew the first plans which envisioned a baroque plan similar to the [[Church of the Ges\u00f9|Church of the Gesu]] in Rome.<ref>''St. Joseph Valley Register'', 30 September 1869.</ref> Because of the limited budget, the church at Notre Dame was not to be as large or as elaborate as the Roman edifice, but rather the size of the [[Church of the Ges\u00f9 (Montreal)|church of the same name  in Montreal]].<ref>Lemonnier to Edwards, 7 July 1869. Lemonnier Letters. UNDA.</ref> The original plan featured a cruciform church two hundred feet in length with three naves and a transept, a dome over the crossing, two large bell-towers, and a capacity of 2,000. The estimated cost would be around $100,000.\n\nFr. Sorin decided that these plans were too grandiose, and that the church could not cost more than half that sum, since at the moment they had only about $8,000 dollars at hand. In January 1870, a new architect, Mr. T. Brady from St. Louis, drew new plans for the church. It is not sure who drew the definite plans, but it is likely that also Fr. Sorin,  Rev. Alexis Granger, C.S.C., and Irish-born Brother Charles Borromeo Harding, C.S.C., a hard-working, self-taught campus builder were part of the planning and building. The new church was erected in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] rather than [[Baroque architecture|baroque,]] reflecting Fr. Sorin's French taste and his will to build a remarkable and striking landmark. Work on the foundations for the new church began in the spring of 1870, and the cornerstone was laid on 31 May 1871, with six bishops present, including Cincinnati Archbishop [[John Baptist Purcell|John Purcell]]. The building took many years to finish and underwent many changes.  As soon as it was inhabitable, university leaders installed an organ and held functions and celebrations in the unfinished building.  Bishop [[Joseph Gregory Dwenger]] finally consecrated the new sanctuary on 15 August 1888. In 1931, it underwent its first thorough renovation by designed by New York architect Wilfred E. Anthony.  [[File:Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Notre Dame, Indiana) - interior, The Lady Chapel, mural, The Exaltation of the Holy Cross by Luigi Gregori, looking straight up.jpg|thumbnail|left|Exaltation of the Holy Cross|244x244px]]In 1968, the church was renovated with the intention of bringing it in line with the liturgical reform of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The church again received a renovation 20 years later, executed by [[Conrad Schmitt Studios]], during which some of the 1968 renovations were reverted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Basilica of the Sacred Heart is the heart of Indiana's University of Notre Dame campus |url=https://www.midwestguest.com/2010/12/basilica-of-the-sacred-heart-is-the-heart-of-indianas-university-of-notre-dame-campus.html |website=Midwest Guest |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref> The conservation and restoration of the historic stained glass windows, created in Le Mans, France, was one of the studio's largest single projects, with 116 windows and over 1,200 panels of glass. On 17 January 1992, [[Pope John Paul II]] raised the Church of the Sacred Heart to the status of [[Minor basilica]]. This designation is one factor in making it a popular destination for approximately 50,000 pilgrims and tourists who visit annually. From 1977 through 1997, Rev. [[Daniel R. Jenky]], C.S.C., of the Diocese of Peoria, Illinois, served as rector of the basilica, before he became head of the religious community there and later [[Auxiliary Bishop]] and vicar general of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne\u2013South Bend|The Dioceseof Fort Wayne\u2013South Bend]] and later [[bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of the  [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria|Diocese of Peoria]], [[Illinois]].

The bell tower is 218 feet tall, and topped by a 12 feet tall golden cross, making its total of 230 feet the tallest height on campus.<ref>{{cite web |title=10 Iconic Landmarks at Notre Dame |url=https://visitsouthbend.com/10-iconic-landmarks-at-notre-dame/ |website=Visit South Bend Mishawaka |accessdate=15 January 2019 |date=28 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Notre Dame, Indiana) - exterior, east portal, memorial to Notre Dame students killed in WWI.jpg|thumb|right|World War I memorial door]]\n\n===World War I Memorial Door===\nPlans for a memorial for Notre Dame's contributions to World War I began in 1919 shortly after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice]]. Funds were collected by the Notre Dame Service Club and the local chapter of the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]]. Notre Dame architects Francis Kervick and Vincent Fagan designed the work for a memorial door on the east transept of the basilica. The final design featured a door surmounted by a pointed arch and flanked by two [[buttresses]], all in gothic style and yellow brick as the rest of the Basilica. Initially, the memorial was meant to commemorate all 2,500 Notre Dame affiliates who fought in the war, including future presidents Rev. [[Matthew J. Walsh]] and Rev. [[Charles L. O'Donnell]] who had served as [[military chaplains]]. However, later revisions to the plan reduced it to two plaques flanking the door and commemorating the 46 Notre Dame students, alumni, and faculty who died in combat. The door itself is in oak with iron hinges, and contains two stained glass windows displaying the [[Tudor Rose]] and the [[Poppy]]. The stone [[lintel]] topping the door is inscribed with the words \u201cIn Glory Everlasting\u201d, while above the lintel a carved panel depicts two eagles supporting a shield with the old university seal (in use before 1930) and carrying in their claws a ribbon which the words \u201cGod, Country, Notre Dame.\u201d Above the door, the words \"Our Gallant Dead\" are inscribed in the stone facade. <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Scholastic |date=May 1924 |volume=57 |issue=9 |pages=232\u2013233 |url=http://archives.nd.edu/Scholastic/VOL_0057/VOL_0057_ISSUE_0009.pdf |accessdate=7 November 2019}}</ref> Statues of [[Jean of Arc]] and [[St. Michael]] by Rev.

The [[tabernacle]] tower, which holds the reserved Blessed Sacrament, was inspired by Revelation 21:9, the vision of the [[new Jerusalem]]. Following the [[Second Vatican Council]] the gothic altar was moved to the apse, and a new altar was placed in the transept. This altar, called the Altar of Sacrifice, was made from old pews and choir stalls from the Lady Chapel. The third altar is a baroque altar in the Lady Chapel believed to come from the studios of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Giovanni Bernini]] in Rome. Next to the gothic altar there are the [[Umbraculum]] and the [[Tintinnabulum]], which are adorned with the insignia of the Roman Pontiff and the coat of arms of the Basilica, the diocesis, and the congregation. These two objects are symbols of the designation of minor basilica.\nThe baptismal font, which is located at the entrance of the church, dates from 1871.<ref>{{cite web |title=Basilica of the Sacred Heart is the heart of Indiana's University of Notre Dame campus |url=https://www.midwestguest.com/2010/12/basilica-of-the-sacred-heart-is-the-heart-of-indianas-university-of-notre-dame-campus.html |website=Midwest Guest |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref> \n\n===Frescoes===\nThe frescoes adorning the walls and the ceilings of the nave were painted by Vatican painter and artist in residence [[Luigi Gregori]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sniteartmuseum.nd.edu/assets/134872/gregori_artist_in_residence_catalog_2.5_mb_pdf_.pdf | title=Artist in Residence: Working Drawings by Luigi Gregori (1819\u20131896) | publisher=The Snite Museum of Art | accessdate=6 December 2018 }}</ref>.

Each of the 12 bays of the vaulted veilinceuling is decorated with an angel, for a total of 96 painted angels. Gregori also painted the stations of the Cross that decorate the walls of the main nave. The neogothic style of the frescoes is similar to that of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]], which was done by Bernardino Riccardi, [[Pietro Gagliardi]], Tommaso Greggia, and [[Raffaele Casn\u00e9di]] in the mid 1800s.

The windows in the chapel depict stories connected to Mary in history: two panels depict the [[Battle of Lepanto]], then [[Louis IX]]  promises a pilgrimage to [[Nazareth]], then [[Louis XIII]] and [[Cardinal Richelieu]] increased devotion to [[Our Lady of the Rosary|Our Lady of Victories]], then Our Lady of Victories with the [[Child Jesus]] above the globe of universe, and [[John Eudes]] venerating the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=O'Meara |first1=Thomas |title=The Basilica of the Sacred Heart at Notre Dame : a theological guide to the paintings and windows |date=1991 |publisher=Ave Maria Press |location=Notre Dame, IN |edition=1st |url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no%3A39701090}}</ref>\n*The Chapel of Holy Angels contains a framed modern painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe, painted by Maria Tomasula, Professor of Art and Art History and The Michael P.

The Lady Chapel was a common feature in medieval cathedrals and it was also inspired by the one present in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. The main feature of the chapel is the statue of Mary. Under it, is a baroque altar believed to come from the studios of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Giovanni Bernini]] in Rome, where Fr. Sorin saw it during one of his trips. The tabernacle doors contain a fragment of wood believed to be from a table on which St. Peter celebrated Mass in Rome. The Chapel, also known as Chapel of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (depicted in the ceiling painted by Luigi Gregori) and Sacred Heart Chapel, was added on to the Basilica in 1886 to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of Fr. Sorin's ordination in 1888. The windows depict stories from the life of Jesus.\n*The Reliquary Chapel houses [[relics]] of the [[Twelve Apostles]], a piece of the [[True Cross]], the burial of St. Severa, and numerous other objects of veneration. The wax figure is of [[St. Severa]], a third century martyr. The cloth covered boxes at her head and feet contain her relics. Above the relic case is a copy of a portion of Raphael's fresco, [[Disputation of the Holy Sacrament]]. The chapel also hosts a copy of the [[Bronze statue of Saint Peter]] in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] and a copy of the icon of [[Our Lady of Czestochova]]. The windows depict stories and miracles of Christian relics, such as the [[Translation of the Relics of Saint Nicholas from Myra to Bari]] or the relics of [[Martin_of_Tours#Legend_of_Martin's_cloak|St. Martin]].\n*The Brother Andre Chapel, which houses a statue of Saint [[Andre Bessette]], C.S.C., is dedicated to the first saint of the Congregation. He was canonized in 2010 for his work among the needy in [[Montreal]]. The chapel holds a statue of Saint Andr\u00e9 Bessette was designed by the Rev. Anthony Lauck, C.S.C. (1985). The windows depict episodes about Mary starting with the presentation to the temple.\n*The Holy Family Chapel honors the life of [[St. Joseph]] and hosts Ivan Mestrovic's masterpiece, The Descent from the Cross or Pieta. The sculptor did the sketches for this magnificent [[pieta]] while he was a political prisoner of the Nazis. Mestrovic used his own likeness for [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. The work was exhibited at New York's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] before going on display in the church in 1955. A copy of it is held at the [[Vatican Museums]]. The windows of the Chapel depict stories of the Holy Family and the Nativity. \n\n[[File:Mestrovic Pieta.jpg|thumbnail|left|Mestrovic Pieta]]\n\n===Organ===\n[[File:Sacred Heart basilica, Interior new organ.jpg|thumbnail|The Murdy family organ, the basilica's fifth organ, installed in 2016]]\nThe first Sacred Heart Church had a small reed organ in the 1850s. In 1865 Father Edward Sorin approved its replacement with a hand-pumped organ of 1,500 pipes. In 1875 [[Felgemaker Organ Company|Derrick and Felgemeker]] of [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] installed a 2,000 pipe organ inside the new and still incomplete Sacred Heart Church, which was eventually brought inside the completed church. In 1961 university president Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh approved the addition 300 pipes to the organ. On April 2, 1978, a new organ is installed, donated by Marjorie O'Malley and built by the [[Holtkamp Organ Company]] of [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. It debuted at a dedication Mass celebrated by Hesburgh and a recital performed by Professor Michael Schneider of [[Cologne, Germany]]. Professor Craig Cramer joined Notre Dame's Department of Music in the fall of 1981 and inherited department chair Calvin Bower's charge to form the organ performance program.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Timeline of the Basilica Organ Project // Notre Dame Magazine // University of Notre Dame |url=https://magazine.nd.edu/basilica-organ/the-timeline-of-the-basilica-organ-project/ |website=magazine.nd.edu |accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2006, Campus Ministry formed a committee to consider replacement of the basilica organ, headed by Dr. Gail Walton, the basilica's director of music since 1988. The committee performed a nationwide search, and in December 2006 it traveled to Columbus, Ohio, for the dedication of the new [[Paul Fritts]] organ in [[St. Joseph Cathedral (Columbus, Ohio)|Saint Joseph Cathedral]] and decided to commission the new organ to Fritts, which became Fritt's second commission from Notre Dame. Previously, Paul Fritts and Company Organ Builders of Tacoma, Washington, had finished a 35-stop organ, also an O\u2019Malley gift, designed in the northern German tradition, for the Reyes Organ and Choral Hall of the new DeBartolo Performing Arts Center in 2004. The [[Great Recession of 2008]] halted the project by taking a hit on the university endowment and benefactions, and the idea of replacing the basilica organ was tabled indefinitely. The project was further dealt a blow by the death of its foremost champion Gail Walton in February 2010. Yet, in the fall of 2010, the university approves a plan to commission a new organ for the basilica and the begins to search for a donor. As decided previously, organ maker Paul Fritts was commissioned with the project and began to design and authorizes pipe making in 2012 before signing the contract. Work on the case in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] began in 2013. The project eventually called for a four-manual instrument with 70 stops, 5,164 pipes and a case inspired by Dutch masterpieces, and it was to become Fritts\u2019 [[magnum opus]]. The basilica closed in Christmas 2013 for the first phase of the organ project, the a 44-day replacement of the church carpeting with 25,000 slate-colored porcelain tiles to improve acoustics. In the meanwhile, a third Fritts commission, sponsored by Denis \u201967 and Susan McCusker, sees a studio organ designed in 2014 for the Walton Choir Rehearsal Hall in Coleman-Morse Center.\nOn December 28, 2015, the Holtkamp organs played its last song, [[Silent Night]], before its dismantling started the next morning. The organ pipes were donated to the reconstruction of a local parish, Pius XI in Granger Indiana. In October 2015, Fritts loans the church the fourth organ  once the Holtkamp is removed. Work commences on reinforcing the [[choir loft]]\u2019s concrete and adding steel support structures to the foundation. During the installation of the new organ, the basilica choirs will sing next to the interim organ in the west transept. <ref>{{cite web |title=The Timeline of the Basilica Organ Project // Notre Dame Magazine // University of Notre Dame |url=https://magazine.nd.edu/basilica-organ/the-timeline-of-the-basilica-organ-project/ |website=magazine.nd.edu |accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe new organ, named for benefactors Wayne and Diana Murdy, was transported onto a pair of tractor-trailers to the basilica on Sunday, July 31 2016. By end of August 2016, the fa\u00e7ade and case was completed, and Fritts Company beginned the process of tuning and voicing the pipes and connecting the organ's key action, stop actiwind worksorks and electrical wiring. The organ's first full performance test occurred during the annual [[Blue Mass]] honoring police, firefighters and emergency medical personnel on October 6, with the tuning of last rank of pipes in the following weeks. It was finished on schedule for Christmas 2016. <ref>{{cite web |title=The Timeline of the Basilica Organ Project // Notre Dame Magazine // University of Notre Dame |url=https://magazine.nd.edu/basilica-organ/the-timeline-of-the-basilica-organ-project/ |website=magazine.nd.edu |accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref> The new four-manual 70-stop Murdy Family Organ was designed and built by [[Paul Fritts|Paul Fritts & Company Organ Builders]] as its Opus 37.

Many items belonged to Fr. Edward Sorin, founder of the University. Items on display also include liturgical vessels and chalices, personal effects of Luigi Gregori, a cassock that belonged to [[Pope Paul VI]], chalices and cassock of [[Pope Pius IX]], and a six-foot- high [[processional cross]] presented to Notre Dame by [[Napoleon III]] and [[Empress Eugenie]]. Of particular significance, a [[papal tiara]] from the 1850s donated to Edward Sorin by Pope Pius IX. It is only one of two in existence outside the Vatican, and of these two the only traditional one, the other being the modernist [[ List of papal tiaras in existence|tiara of Paul VI]].\n\nThe basement holds the Bishop's Museum, which contains pontificalia of various American bishops, dating from the 19th century. It hosts ornate and embroidered [[vestments]], [[Mitre|mitres]], shoes, caps, sandals, sashes, gloves, Cardinals\u2019 [[Galero|galeros]], chalices, vestments embroidered by the daughter of the Empress of Austria. These include Rev. Alexis Granger's sick-call satchel, containing oils to [[Last rites|anoint the sick]]; [[crosier]] and [[pectoral cross]] of the Reverend John Carroll (first Catholic bishop of the United States); a gold screen from the sanctuary of [[Santa Brigida, Rome|Santa Brigida]] through which [[St. Bridget of Sweden]] used to hear Mass; [[mitre]] of bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] (first bishop of Philadelphia); crosier, mitre, and rabbi used by cardinal [[John McCloskey]], first bishop of Albany; [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]] from 1840 of the first bishop of California, [[Francisco Diego]]; cassock and books written by and about Archbishop Marcos G. McGrath, CSC.\n\n==Liturgies==\n[[File:NDBasilicaWedding.jpg|right|thumb|Basilica Wedding]]\nThe basilica is the main liturgical center for the university community. Mass is held twice daily, while the university is in session, and once daily during breaks. Each weekend there are three Sunday masses celebrated for students, faculty, staff and community members. The basilica is a popular place for weddings of Notre Dame alumni, hosting several weddings each Saturday, whenever the [[Fighting Irish]] do not have a home football game. The basilica has also been the site of final professions and [[ordination]] masses for the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]], as well as funerals for the religious community and for alumni.\n[[File:Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Notre Dame, Indiana) - interior, original altar (designed by Froc-Robert and Sons of Paris) with tabernacle tower.jpg|left|thumb|The High altar]]\nEach Sunday evening the basilica holds Solemn [[Vespers]] and a special service during [[Advent]], known as Lessons and Carols. [[Stations of the Cross]] is celebrated each Friday during the season of [[Lent]]. At other times throughout the year, the basilica hosts special liturgies of all kinds. The [[Paschal Triduum]] is celebrated every Easter and it lasts from [[Holy Thursday]] with the celebration of the [[Last Supper]] until [[Easter Sunday]] with [[Vespers]]. These celebrations are very popular among students and local inhabitants, and Easter liturgies are always very crowded. Located in the Crypt Church (basement level) of the basilica is Sacred Heart Parish. \nTwo people are buried in the Basilica: Cardinal [[John Francis O'Hara]], who is buried in the Chapel of the Holy Cross, and [[Orestes Brownson]], who is buried in the crypt. \n\n===Broadcasts===\nSince 2002, Sunday masses from the basilica have been broadcast nationwide. Special care is taken to ensure that broadcasting equipment captures the beauty of the mass without impacting the rite. Currently, the 10:00 A.M. mass is broadcast on [[CatholicTV]], while the 11:45 A.M. mass is broadcast online at NDPrayerCast.org and through [[iTunes]].\n\n==Carillon==\nThe original 23 bells were installed in 1856 and make-up the oldest [[carillon]] in North America. They were made in France, and each has a name related to Mary. The final bell, which is one of the grandest in the United States, was blessed in 1888, during Father Sorin's Golden jubilee. It is named for [[St. Anthony of Padua]], it is an immense bass bell, or bourdon, more than seven feet tall and weighing 15,400 pounds.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallery\n|width=160 | height=170\n|File:Sacred Heart basilica, Interior 3.jpg\n |alt2=Nave\n |Nave\n|File:God Quad in the Winter with a view of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart.JPG\n |alt1=Basilica in the winter\n |Basilica in the winter\n|File:Sacred Heart Basilica -

[[Claude-Jean Allouez]], S.J., established the Ste-Marie-des-Lacs mission on the south shore of the St. Mary's lake, in order to serve the local [[Potawatomi]] tribe along with French trappers and settlers in the area. The French Catholic missionaries were expelled by the British from the area following the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763, but in 1832 Ste-Marie-des-Lacs was re-established by [[Stephen Badin]] and the [[Log Chapel (University of Notre Dame)]] was built. \n\n===The first church===\nWhen Rev. [[Edward Sorin]], C.S.C., established the University of Notre Dame, the community held religious services in the small log cabin built by Stephen Badin. This was replaced by a larger log cabin between 1842 and 1843.   \n[[File:Sacred Heart basilica, Interior 4.jpg|left|thumb|330x330px|Nave and vaulted ceiling]]The growth of the institution required a proper church, and school leaders decided to spend $1500 to construct a new edifice. Work began on 25 May 1848, and the structure was dedicated on 12 November of the following year. The solemn consecration took place a year later, on 11 November 1849, with [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vincennes, Indiana|Bishop of Vincennes]], [[Jacques-Maurice De Saint Palais|Maurice de St. Palais]] presiding.<ref>{{cite web| title=Notre Dame \u2014 One Hundred Years: Chapter V| url=http://archives.nd.edu/hope/hope05.htm| first=Arthur J.| last=Hope, C.S.C.| publisher=University of Notre Dame|\n year=1999}}</ref> Father Sorin describes the first church: \"The style is Greek, with rounded arches. There are three vaults and six columns which produce a very pretty effect. The tribune, which has been built for the use of the Sisters, is elliptical like the sanctuary. It is already enriched with an organ of Mr. H. Erben, and, though a little weak for the church, is one of its most precious ornaments.\"<ref>16 Sorin, ''Chronicle'', 84-85.</ref>\n\nShortly after the completion of the church, the university added a bell to its tower. In the spring of 1851, the wind swept tower and bell to the ground. That summer, university leaders purchased a larger bell in Cincinnati weighing {{convert|3220|lb|kg}} and installed it in one of the church towers after it was blessed on the feast of the Assumption. In 1852 double spires were built by a local carpenter in exchange for his son's tuition at the school.<ref>{{cite web |title=Basilica of the Sacred Heart is the heart of Indiana's University of Notre Dame campus |url=https://www.midwestguest.com/2010/12/basilica-of-the-sacred-heart-is-the-heart-of-indianas-university-of-notre-dame-campus.html |website=Midwest Guest |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===The second (and present) church===\nThe University's needs soon outgrew the small first church and in spring of 1869 the leaders decided to build a new church dedicated to Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, despite the lack of funds in the school's treasury.  [[File:Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Notre Dame, Indiana) - interior, vault.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ceiling of the nave|275x275px]]\n\nPopular architect [[Patrick Keely]] drew the first plans which envisioned a baroque plan similar to the [[Church of the Ges\u00f9|Church of the Gesu]] in Rome.<ref>''St. Joseph Valley Register'', 30 September 1869.</ref> Because of the limited budget, the church at Notre Dame was not to be as large or as elaborate as the Roman edifice, but rather the size of the [[Church of the Ges\u00f9 (Montreal)|church of the same name  in Montreal]].<ref>Lemonnier to Edwards, 7 July 1869. Lemonnier Letters. UNDA.</ref> The original plan featured a cruciform church two hundred feet in length with three naves and a transept, a dome over the crossing, two large bell-towers, and a capacity of 2,000. The estimated cost would be around $100,000.\n\nFr. Sorin decided that these plans were too grandiose, and that the church could not cost more than half that sum, since at the moment they had only about $8,000 dollars at hand. In January 1870, a new architect, Mr. T. Brady from St. Louis, drew new plans for the church. It is not sure who drew the definite plans, but it is likely that also Fr. Sorin,  Rev. Alexis Granger, C.S.C., and Irish-born Brother Charles Borromeo Harding, C.S.C., a hard-working, self-taught campus builder were part of the planning and building. The new church was erected in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] rather than [[Baroque architecture|baroque,]] reflecting Fr. Sorin's French taste and his will to build a remarkable and striking landmark. Work on the foundations for the new church began in the spring of 1870, and the cornerstone was laid on 31 May 1871, with six bishops present, including Cincinnati Archbishop [[John Baptist Purcell|John Purcell]]. The building took many years to finish and underwent many changes.  As soon as it was inhabitable, university leaders installed an organ and held functions and celebrations in the unfinished building.  Bishop [[Joseph Gregory Dwenger]] finally consecrated the new sanctuary on 15 August 1888. In 1931, it underwent its first thorough renovation by designed by New York architect Wilfred E. Anthony.  [[File:Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Notre Dame, Indiana) - interior, The Lady Chapel, mural, The Exaltation of the Holy Cross by Luigi Gregori, looking straight up.jpg|thumbnail|left|Exaltation of the Holy Cross|244x244px]]In 1968, the church was renovated with the intention of bringing it in line with the liturgical reform of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The church again received a renovation 20 years later, executed by [[Conrad Schmitt Studios]], during which some of the 1968 renovations were reverted.<ref>{{cite web |title=Basilica of the Sacred Heart is the heart of Indiana's University of Notre Dame campus |url=https://www.midwestguest.com/2010/12/basilica-of-the-sacred-heart-is-the-heart-of-indianas-university-of-notre-dame-campus.html |website=Midwest Guest |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref> The conservation and restoration of the historic stained glass windows, created in Le Mans, France, was one of the studio's largest single projects, with 116 windows and over 1,200 panels of glass. On 17 January 1992, [[Pope John Paul II]] raised the Church of the Sacred Heart to the status of [[Minor basilica]]. This designation is one factor in making it a popular destination for approximately 50,000 pilgrims and tourists who visit annually. From 1977 through 1997, Rev. [[Daniel R. Jenky]], C.S.C., of the Diocese of Peoria, Illinois, served as rector of the basilica, before he became head of the religious community there and later [[Auxiliary Bishop]] and vicar general of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne\u2013South Bend|The Dioceseof Fort Wayne\u2013South Bend]] and later [[bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of the  [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria|Diocese of Peoria]], [[Illinois]].

The bell tower is 218 feet tall, and topped by a 12 feet tall golden cross, making its total of 230 feet the tallest height on campus.<ref>{{cite web |title=10 Iconic Landmarks at Notre Dame |url=https://visitsouthbend.com/10-iconic-landmarks-at-notre-dame/ |website=Visit South Bend Mishawaka |accessdate=15 January 2019 |date=28 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Notre Dame, Indiana) - exterior, east portal, memorial to Notre Dame students killed in WWI.jpg|thumb|right|World War I memorial door]]\n\n===World War I Memorial Door===\nPlans for a memorial for Notre Dame's contributions to World War I began in 1919 shortly after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice]]. Funds were collected by the Notre Dame Service Club and the local chapter of the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]]. Notre Dame architects Francis Kervick and Vincent Fagan designed the work for a memorial door on the east transept of the basilica. The final design featured a door surmounted by a pointed arch and flanked by two [[buttresses]], all in gothic style and yellow brick as the rest of the Basilica. Initially, the memorial was meant to commemorate all 2,500 Notre Dame affiliates who fought in the war, including future presidents Rev. [[Matthew J. Walsh]] and Rev. [[Charles L. O'Donnell]] who had served as [[military chaplains]]. However, later revisions to the plan reduced it to two plaques flanking the door and commemorating the 46 Notre Dame students, alumni, and faculty who died in combat. The door itself is in oak with iron hinges, and contains two stained glass windows displaying the [[Tudor Rose]] and the [[Poppy]]. The stone [[lintel]] topping the door is inscribed with the words \u201cIn Glory Everlasting\u201d, while above the lintel a carved panel depicts two eagles supporting a shield with the old university seal (in use before 1930) and carrying in their claws a ribbon which the words \u201cGod, Country, Notre Dame.\u201d Above the door, the words \"Our Gallant Dead\" are inscribed in the stone facade. <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Scholastic |date=May 1924 |volume=57 |issue=9 |pages=232\u2013233 |url=http://archives.nd.edu/Scholastic/VOL_0057/VOL_0057_ISSUE_0009.pdf |accessdate=7 November 2019}}</ref> Statues of [[Jean of Arc]] and [[St. Michael]] by Rev.

The [[tabernacle]] tower, which holds the reserved Blessed Sacrament, was inspired by Revelation 21:9, the vision of the [[new Jerusalem]]. Following the [[Second Vatican Council]] the gothic altar was moved to the apse, and a new altar was placed in the transept. This altar, called the Altar of Sacrifice, was made from old pews and choir stalls from the Lady Chapel. The third altar is a baroque altar in the Lady Chapel believed to come from the studios of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Giovanni Bernini]] in Rome. Next to the gothic altar there are the [[Umbraculum]] and the [[Tintinnabulum]], which are adorned with the insignia of the Roman Pontiff and the coat of arms of the Basilica, the diocesis, and the congregation. These two objects are symbols of the designation of minor basilica.\nThe baptismal font, which is located at the entrance of the church, dates from 1871.<ref>{{cite web |title=Basilica of the Sacred Heart is the heart of Indiana's University of Notre Dame campus |url=https://www.midwestguest.com/2010/12/basilica-of-the-sacred-heart-is-the-heart-of-indianas-university-of-notre-dame-campus.html |website=Midwest Guest |accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref> \n\n===Frescoes===\nThe frescoes adorning the walls and the ceilings of the nave were painted by Vatican painter and artist in residence [[Luigi Gregori]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sniteartmuseum.nd.edu/assets/134872/gregori_artist_in_residence_catalog_2.5_mb_pdf_.pdf | title=Artist in Residence: Working Drawings by Luigi Gregori (1819\u20131896) | publisher=The Snite Museum of Art | accessdate=6 December 2018 }}</ref>.

Each of the 12 bays of the vaulted veilinceuling is decorated with an angel, for a total of 96 painted angels. Gregori also painted the stations of the Cross that decorate the walls of the main nave. The neogothic style of the frescoes is similar to that of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]], which was done by Bernardino Riccardi, [[Pietro Gagliardi]], Tommaso Greggia, and [[Raffaele Casn\u00e9di]] in the mid 1800s.

The Lady Chapel was a common feature in medieval cathedrals and it was also inspired by the one present in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. The main feature of the chapel is the statue of Mary. Under it, is a baroque altar believed to come from the studios of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Giovanni Bernini]] in Rome, where Fr. Sorin saw it during one of his trips. The tabernacle doors contain a fragment of wood believed to be from a table on which St. Peter celebrated Mass in Rome. The Chapel, also known as Chapel of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (depicted in the ceiling painted by Luigi Gregori) and Sacred Heart Chapel, was added on to the Basilica in 1886 to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of Fr. Sorin's ordination in 1888. The windows depict stories from the life of Jesus.\n*The Reliquary Chapel houses [[relics]] of the [[Twelve Apostles]], a piece of the [[True Cross]], the burial of St. Severa, and numerous other objects of veneration. The wax figure is of [[St. Severa]], a third century martyr. The cloth covered boxes at her head and feet contain her relics. Above the relic case is a copy of a portion of Raphael's fresco, [[Disputation of the Holy Sacrament]]. The chapel also hosts a copy of the [[Bronze statue of Saint Peter]] in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] and a copy of the icon of [[Our Lady of Czestochova]]. The windows depict stories and miracles of Christian relics, such as the [[Translation of the Relics of Saint Nicholas from Myra to Bari]] or the relics of [[Martin_of_Tours#Legend_of_Martin's_cloak|St. Martin]].\n*The Brother Andre Chapel, which houses a statue of Saint [[Andre Bessette]], C.S.C., is dedicated to the first saint of the Congregation. He was canonized in 2010 for his work among the needy in [[Montreal]]. The chapel holds a statue of Saint Andr\u00e9 Bessette was designed by the Rev. Anthony Lauck, C.S.C. (1985). The windows depict episodes about Mary starting with the presentation to the temple.\n*The Holy Family Chapel honors the life of [[St. Joseph]] and hosts Ivan Mestrovic's masterpiece, The Descent from the Cross or Pieta. The sculptor did the sketches for this magnificent [[pieta]] while he was a political prisoner of the Nazis. Mestrovic used his own likeness for [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. The work was exhibited at New York's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] before going on display in the church in 1955. A copy of it is held at the [[Vatican Museums]]. The windows of the Chapel depict stories of the Holy Family and the Nativity. \n\n[[File:Mestrovic Pieta.jpg|thumbnail|left|Mestrovic Pieta]]\n\n===Organ===\n[[File:Sacred Heart basilica, Interior new organ.jpg|thumbnail|The Murdy family organ, the basilica's fifth organ, installed in 2016]]\nThe first Sacred Heart Church had a small reed organ in the 1850s. In 1865 Father Edward Sorin approved its replacement with a hand-pumped organ of 1,500 pipes. In 1875 [[Felgemaker Organ Company|Derrick and Felgemeker]] of [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] installed a 2,000 pipe organ inside the new and still incomplete Sacred Heart Church, which was eventually brought inside the completed church. In 1961 university president Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh approved the addition 300 pipes to the organ. On April 2, 1978, a new organ is installed, donated by Marjorie O'Malley and built by the [[Holtkamp Organ Company]] of [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. It debuted at a dedication Mass celebrated by Hesburgh and a recital performed by Professor Michael Schneider of [[Cologne, Germany]]. Professor Craig Cramer joined Notre Dame's Department of Music in the fall of 1981 and inherited department chair Calvin Bower's charge to form the organ performance program.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Timeline of the Basilica Organ Project // Notre Dame Magazine // University of Notre Dame |url=https://magazine.nd.edu/basilica-organ/the-timeline-of-the-basilica-organ-project/ |website=magazine.nd.edu |accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2006, Campus Ministry formed a committee to consider replacement of the basilica organ, headed by Dr. Gail Walton, the basilica's director of music since 1988. The committee performed a nationwide search, and in December 2006 it traveled to Columbus, Ohio, for the dedication of the new [[Paul Fritts]] organ in [[St. Joseph Cathedral (Columbus, Ohio)|Saint Joseph Cathedral]] and decided to commission the new organ to Fritts, which became Fritt's second commission from Notre Dame. Previously, Paul Fritts and Company Organ Builders of Tacoma, Washington, had finished a 35-stop organ, also an O\u2019Malley gift, designed in the northern German tradition, for the Reyes Organ and Choral Hall of the new DeBartolo Performing Arts Center in 2004. The [[Great Recession of 2008]] halted the project by taking a hit on the university endowment and benefactions, and the idea of replacing the basilica organ was tabled indefinitely. The project was further dealt a blow by the death of its foremost champion Gail Walton in February 2010. Yet, in the fall of 2010, the university approves a plan to commission a new organ for the basilica and the begins to search for a donor. As decided previously, organ maker Paul Fritts was commissioned with the project and began to design and authorizes pipe making in 2012 before signing the contract. Work on the case in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] began in 2013, and The project eventually called for a four-manual instrument with 70 stops, 5,164 pipes and a case inspired by Dutch masterpieces, and it was to become Fritts\u2019 [[magnum opus]]. The basilica closed in Christmas 2013 for the first phase of the organ project, the a 44-day replacement of the church carpeting with 25,000 slate-colored porcelain tiles to improve acoustics. In the meanwhile, a third Fritts commission, sponsored by Denis \u201967 and Susan McCusker, sees a studio organ designed in 2014 for the Walton Choir Rehearsal Hall in Coleman-Morse Center.\nOn December 28, 2015, the Holtkamp organs played its last song, [[Silent Night]], before its dismantling started the next morning. The organ pipes were donated to the reconstruction of a local parish, Pius XI in Granger Indiana. In October 2015, Fritts loans the church the fourth organ  once the Holtkamp is removed. Work commences on reinforcing the [[choir loft]]\u2019s concrete and adding steel support structures to the foundation. During the installation of the new organ, the basilica choirs will sing next to the interim organ in the west transept. <ref>{{cite web |title=The Timeline of the Basilica Organ Project // Notre Dame Magazine // University of Notre Dame |url=https://magazine.nd.edu/basilica-organ/the-timeline-of-the-basilica-organ-project/ |website=magazine.nd.edu |accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe new organ, named for benefactors Wayne and Diana Murdy, was transported onto a pair of tractor-trailers to the basilica on Sunday, July 31 2016. By end of August 2016, the fa\u00e7ade and case was completed, and Fritts Company beginned the process of tuning and voicing the pipes and connecting the organ's key action, stop actiwind worksorks and electrical wiring. The organ's first full performance test occurred during the annual [[Blue Mass]] honoring police, firefighters and emergency medical personnel on October 6, with the tuning of last rank of pipes in the following weeks. It was finished on schedule for Christmas 2016. <ref>{{cite web |title=The Timeline of the Basilica Organ Project // Notre Dame Magazine // University of Notre Dame |url=https://magazine.nd.edu/basilica-organ/the-timeline-of-the-basilica-organ-project/ |website=magazine.nd.edu |accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref> The new four-manual 70-stop Murdy Family Organ was designed and built by [[Paul Fritts|Paul Fritts & Company Organ Builders]] as its Opus 37.

Many items belonged to Fr. Edward Sorin, founder of the University. Items on display also include liturgical vessels and chalices, personal effects of Luigi Gregori, a cassock that belonged to [[Pope Paul VI]], chalices and cassock of [[Pope Pius IX]], and a six-foot- high [[processional cross]] presented to Notre Dame by [[Napoleon III]] and [[Empress Eugenie]]. Of particular significance, a [[papal tiara]] from the 1850s donated to Edward Sorin by Pope Pius IX. It is only one of two in existence outside the Vatican, and of these two the only traditional one, the other being the modernist [[ List of papal tiaras in existence|tiara of Paul VI]].\n\nThe basement holds the Bishop's Museum, which contains pontificalia of various American bishops, dating from the 19th century. It hosts ornate and embroidered [[vestments]], [[Mitre|mitres]], shoes, caps, sandals, sashes, gloves, Cardinals\u2019 [[Galero|galeros]], chalices, vestments embroidered by the daughter of the Empress of Austria.

McGrath, CSC.\n\n==Liturgies==\n[[File:NDBasilicaWedding.jpg|right|thumb|Basilica Wedding]]\nThe basilica is the main liturgical center for the university community. Mass is held twice daily, while the university is in session, and once daily during breaks. Each weekend there are three Sunday masses celebrated for students, faculty, staff and community members. The basilica is a popular place for weddings of Notre Dame alumni, hosting several weddings each Saturday, whenever the [[Fighting Irish]] do not have a home football game. The basilica has also been the site of final professions and [[ordination]] masses for the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]], as well as funerals for the religious community and for alumni.\n[[File:Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Notre Dame, Indiana) - interior, original altar (designed by Froc-Robert and Sons of Paris) with tabernacle tower.jpg|left|thumb|The High altar]]\nEach Sunday evening the basilica holds Solemn [[Vespers]] and a special service during [[Advent]], known as Lessons and Carols. [[Stations of the Cross]] is celebrated each Friday during the season of [[Lent]]. At other times throughout the year, the basilica hosts special liturgies of all kinds. The [[Paschal Triduum]] is celebrated every Easter and it lasts from [[Holy Thursday]] with the celebration of the [[Last Supper]] until [[Easter Sunday]] with [[Vespers]]. These celebrations are very popular among students and local inhabitants, and Easter liturgies are always very crowded. Located in the Crypt Church (basement level) of the basilica is Sacred Heart Parish. \nTwo people are buried in the Basilica: Cardinal [[John Francis O'Hara]], who is buried in the Chapel of the Holy Cross, and [[Orestes Brownson]], who is buried in the crypt. \n\n===Broadcasts===\nSince 2002, Sunday masses from the basilica have been broadcast nationwide. Special care is taken to ensure that broadcasting equipment captures the beauty of the mass without impacting the rite. Currently, the 10:00 A.M. mass is broadcast on [[CatholicTV]], while the 11:45 A.M. mass is broadcast online at NDPrayerCast.org and through [[iTunes]].\n\n==Carillon==\nThe original 23 bells were installed in 1856 and make-up the oldest [[carillon]] in North America. They were made in France, and each has a name related to Mary. The final bell, which is one of the grandest in the United States, was blessed in 1888, during Father Sorin's Golden jubilee. It is named for [[St. Anthony of Padua]], it is an immense bass bell, or bourdon, more than seven feet tall and weighing 15,400 pounds.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallery\n|width=160 | height=170\n|File:Sacred Heart basilica, Interior 3.jpg\n |alt2=Nave\n |Nave\n|File:God Quad in the Winter with a view of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart.JPG\n |alt1=Basilica in the winter\n |Basilica in the winter\n|File:Sacred Heart Basilica - spring2.jpg\n |alt3=Basilica in the summer\n |Basilica in the summer\n|File:Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Notre Dame, IN) - exterior.jpg\n |alt4=East fa\u00e7ade\n |East fa\u00e7ade\n|File:Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Notre Dame, Indiana) - exterior, front portal.jpg\n |alt5=Main portal\n |Main portal\n|File:Sacred Heart basilica, Interior 1.jpg\n |alt6=Front portal\n |Pulpit and altar\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Basilica of the Sacred Heart, University of Notre Dame}}\n* [http://basilica.nd.edu/ Official web site]\n\n{{University of Notre Dame}}\n{{Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne\u2013South Bend}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sacred Heart, Indiana}}\n[[Category:Basilica churches in Indiana]]\n[[Category:Congregation of Holy Cross]]\n[[Category:University of Notre Dame buildings and structures]]\n[[Category:University and college chapels in the United States]]\n[[Category:Churches in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne\u2013South Bend]]\n[[Category:Churches in St. Joseph County, Indiana]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in St. Joseph County, Indiana]]\n[[Category:Historic district contributing properties in Indiana]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic chapels in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Harris7", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOrgan:fix incomplete sentence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_the_Sacred_Heart_(Notre_Dame)"}

{"title_page": "Government of Alabama", "text_new": "[[File:Flag of Alabama.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the state of Alabama]]\nThe '''government of Alabama''' is organized under the provisions of the 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]], the lengthiest constitution of any political entity in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130031023/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596687/ Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds].  From MSNBC.</ref>  Like other [[U.S. state|states]] within the United States, Alabama's government is divided into executive, judicial, and legislative branches.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe Alabama Executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Alabama]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]], the [[Cabinet (government)|Governor's Cabinet]], several popularly elected executive officials, and the executive staff.  The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n\n===Governor===\nThe Governor is the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the state's government. He or she (currently Governor Kay Ivey) is responsible for upholding the [[Alabama Constitution]] and executing [[state law]]. The Governor is elected by [[Direct election|popular election]] every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States. He may also call upon them to render aid during natural disasters or other times when he or she may deem their services to be required.\n\nThe governor of Alabama has power to [[veto]] laws passed by the state legislature (see below). However, in contrast to the practice in most states (and the federal government) that requires the legislature to garner a two-thirds majority to override an executive veto, the Alabama constitution requires only a majority within both legislative houses to accomplish this.  The governor also possesses the power to [[pardon]] convicted criminals, except in cases of [[impeachment]].\n\nAt least once every [[legislative session]], the governor is required to deliver an address to the [[Alabama Legislature]], referred to as the \"[[State of the State address]].\" This address encompasses the condition and operation of the [[State governments of the United States|state government]], and may also suggest new legislation for the legislature's consideration.\n\nThe Governor of Alabama is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]], who has served since 2017.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\nThe current Lieutenant governor is [[Will Ainsworth]] since 2019.\n\n===Independent executive officials===\nAlong with the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, the executive branch is composed of five other popularly elected officials, as well as the Superintendent of Education, who is chosen by the state school board:\n*[[Attorney General of Alabama]] [[Steve Marshall (politician)|Steve Marshall]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109025131/http://www.ago.alabama.gov/bio.cfm ]</ref>\n*[[State Auditor of Alabama]] [[Jim Zeigler]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923180643/http://www.auditor.alabama.gov/about/biography.htm ]</ref>\n*[[Secretary of State of Alabama]] [[John Merrill (American politician)|John Merrill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sos-office/biography|title=Biography &#124; Alabama Secretary of State|website=www.sos.alabama.gov}}</ref>\n*[[State Treasurer of Alabama]] [[John McMillan (Alabama politician)|John McMillan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.alabama.gov/Content/About_Young_Boozer.htm|title=About Young Boozer|work=Alabama State Treasury}}</ref>\n*[[Superintendent of Education of Alabama]] Eric Mackey, Ed.D.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.alsde.edu/sites/boe/Pages/boardmembers-item.aspx?ID=500 |title=SBOE Member |accessdate=9 March 2018 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]] [[Rick Pate]] <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110131040355/http://agi.alabama.gov/about/meet-comm-mcmillan ]</ref>\n\nAll of the independent executive officials serve four-year terms that run concurrent with that of the Governor, who is currently Kay Ivey.\n\n===Cabinet members (as of April 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://governor.alabama.gov/administration/staff/|title=Staff &#124; Kay Ivey - Governor of Alabama}}</ref>===\n* Chief of Staff: Steve Pelham \n* Communications Director: Josh Pendergrass\n* Legal Advisor:  David Byrne\n* Director of Policy: David White\n* Legislative Director: Wesley Helton\n* Administrator of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board: H.

Sellers, Michael F. Bolin, Tom Parker, Brad Mendheim, Greg Shaw, James Allan Main, and Alisa Kelli Wise<ref name=\"supreme\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090618080929/http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm ]</ref>). The Clerk of Court is Robert G. Esdale, Sr.<ref name=\"supreme\"/> As the highest state court, the Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative responsibilities. The court is housed in the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has authority to review decisions rendered by the other courts of the state. It also has authority to determine certain legal matters over which no other court has jurisdiction, and to issue such orders as may prove necessary to carry out its general superintendence over the court system in Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama has exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, as well as appeals from the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]].\n\nThe [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the state's [[judicial system]].  The Supreme Court may make rules governing administration, practice, and procedure for all Alabama courts. Under this authority, uniform rules of practice and procedure and judicial administration have been adopted to eliminate many of the technicalities which cause delay in the trial courts, and needless reversals in the appellate courts.\n\n===Court of the Judiciary===\nA \"Court of the Judiciary\" is created under Alabama law, consisting of one judge of an appellate court (other than the Supreme Court), who shall be selected by the Supreme Court and shall serve as Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary. In addition, two judges of the circuit court are to be appointed to this body, who shall be selected by the Circuit Judges' Association; together with one district judge, who shall be selected by the District Judges' Association. Other members of the Court of the Judiciary are: two members of the state bar, who shall be selected by the governing body of the [[Alabama State Bar]]; three persons (as of 2005) who are not lawyers who shall be appointed by the Governor; and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Members appointed by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be subject to Senate confirmation before serving.\n\nThe Court of the Judiciary is convened to hear complaints filed by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. It has authority, after notice and public hearing, to impose one of two penalties:\n*To remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his or her duties, or\n*To suspend with or without pay, or to retire a judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform his duties.<ref>''Constitution of Alabama of 1901, Amendment 581, \u00a76.18''.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Alabama Legislature}}\nLike other states within the United States, Alabama has a [[State legislature (United States)|legislative branch]].\n\n===House of Representatives===\n{{main|Alabama House of Representatives}}The [[Alabama House of Representatives]] is composed of 105 members, all elected from single-member districts of equal population across the state in the same cycle.  Each member represents a district of approximately 40,000 people,<ref>Article IV, Section 50 of the [[Alabama Constitution]].</ref>  and is elected to a four-year term. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] is currently [[Mac McCutcheon (Alabama politician)|Mac McCutcheon]], a Republican.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201234723/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/houseleaders.html ]</ref>  The current partisan line-up of the House of Representatives is 72 Republicans and 33 Democrats.\n\nAll revenue-raising matters must originate in the Alabama House. A majority of a quorum can pass any bill except a constitutional amendment, which requires a three-fifths vote of all those elected.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Senate===\n{{main|Alabama Senate}}The [[Alabama Senate]] is composed of 35 Senators. Each Senator represents a single-member district of approximately 125,000 Alabamians.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years of age at the time of their election, must be citizens and residents of the state of Alabama for at least 3 years, and reside within their district for at least one year prior to election.<ref>Article IV, Section 47 of the Alabama Constitution]</ref>\n\nAll Senators are elected for four-year terms in the same cycle as the House of Representatives, the Governor, and other statewide constitutional officers.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives has exclusive power to originate revenue bills, such legislation can be amended and/or substituted by the Senate. Moreover, because the Senate is historically considered to be the \"deliberative body\", its rules concerning length of debate are more relaxed than those of the House of Representatives.  The Senate also has a history of filibusters that the rules of the lower house do not as easily tolerate.\n\nThe Alabama Senate has sole power of Confirmation of certain appointees designated by the Constitution and by statute.\n\n===Legislative sessions===\n\n====Regular sessions====\nThe [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]] convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except:\n\n*In the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March, and\n*In the last year of a four-year term, when the session begins on the second Tuesday in January.\n\nThe length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Generally, two meeting or \"legislative\" days are held per week, with other days being devoted to committee meetings. The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n'''General Information'''\n\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n== Seals of the Government of Alabama ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Governor-Elect of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[President-elect|Governor-Elect]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Speaker of the House of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Speaker of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\nFile:Seal of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Courts of Alabama|Unified Judicial System]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Attorney General of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Attorney General of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.svg|Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.svg|Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Corrections.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Corrections]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Homeland Security]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Health.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Health]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Safety.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department.svg|Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department\nFile:Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Alabama National Guard.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama National Guard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elections in Alabama]]\n*[[Courts of Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://governor.state.al.us/ Governor's Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920100305/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/ Legislature Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050917073603/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/ Judicial Office Website]\n*{{Ballotpedia|Alabama|Alabama}}\n\n{{Alabama}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Alabama| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Alabama]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Flag of Alabama.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the state of Alabama]]\nThe '''government of Alabama''' is organized under the provisions of the 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]], the lengthiest constitution of any political entity in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130031023/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596687/ Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds].

The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States. He may also call upon them to render aid during natural disasters or other times when he or she may deem their services to be required.\n\nThe governor of Alabama has power to [[veto]] laws passed by the state legislature (see below). However, in contrast to the practice in most states (and the federal government) that requires the legislature to garner a two-thirds majority to override an executive veto, the Alabama constitution requires only a majority within both legislative houses to accomplish this.  The governor also possesses the power to [[pardon]] convicted criminals, except in cases of [[impeachment]].\n\nAt least once every [[legislative session]], the governor is required to deliver an address to the [[Alabama Legislature]], referred to as the \"[[State of the State address]].\" This address encompasses the condition and operation of the [[State governments of the United States|state government]], and may also suggest new legislation for the legislature's consideration.\n\nThe Governor of Alabama is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]], who has served since 2017.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\nThe current Lieutenant governor is [[Will Ainsworth]] since 2019.\n\n===Independent executive officials===\nAlong with the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, the executive branch is composed of five other popularly elected officials, as well as the Superintendent of Education, who is chosen by the state school board:\n*[[Attorney General of Alabama]] [[Steve Marshall (politician)|Steve Marshall]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109025131/http://www.ago.alabama.gov/bio.cfm ]</ref>\n*[[State Auditor of Alabama]] [[Jim Zeigler]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923180643/http://www.auditor.alabama.gov/about/biography.htm ]</ref>\n*[[Secretary of State of Alabama]] [[John Merrill (American politician)|John Merrill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sos-office/biography|title=Biography &#124; Alabama Secretary of State|website=www.sos.alabama.gov}}</ref>\n*[[State Treasurer of Alabama]] [[John McMillan (Alabama politician)|John McMillan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.alabama.gov/Content/About_Young_Boozer.htm|title=About Young Boozer|work=Alabama State Treasury}}</ref>\n*[[Superintendent of Education of Alabama]] Eric Mackey, Ed.D.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.alsde.edu/sites/boe/Pages/boardmembers-item.aspx?ID=500 |title=SBOE Member |accessdate=9 March 2018 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]] [[Rick Pate]] <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110131040355/http://agi.alabama.gov/about/meet-comm-mcmillan ]</ref>\n\nAll of the independent executive officials serve four-year terms that run concurrent with that of the Governor, who is currently Kay Ivey.\n\n===Cabinet members (as of April 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://governor.alabama.gov/administration/staff/|title=Staff &#124; Kay Ivey - Governor of Alabama}}</ref>===\n* Chief of Staff: Steve Pelham \n* Communications Director: Josh Pendergrass\n* Legal Advisor:  David Byrne\n* Director of Policy: David White\n* Legislative Director: Wesley Helton\n* Administrator of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board: H.

Sellers, Michael F. Bolin, Tom Parker, Brad Mendheim, Greg Shaw, James Allan Main, and Alisa Kelli Wise<ref name=\"supreme\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090618080929/http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm ]</ref>). The Clerk of Court is Robert G. Esdale, Sr.<ref name=\"supreme\"/> As the highest state court, the Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative responsibilities. The court is housed in the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has authority to review decisions rendered by the other courts of the state. It also has authority to determine certain legal matters over which no other court has jurisdiction, and to issue such orders as may prove necessary to carry out its general superintendence over the court system in Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama has exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, as well as appeals from the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]].\n\nThe [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the state's [[judicial system]].  The Supreme Court may make rules governing administration, practice, and procedure for all Alabama courts. Under this authority, uniform rules of practice and procedure and judicial administration have been adopted to eliminate many of the technicalities which cause delay in the trial courts, and needless reversals in the appellate courts.\n\n===Court of the Judiciary===\nA \"Court of the Judiciary\" is created under Alabama law, consisting of one judge of an appellate court (other than the Supreme Court), who shall be selected by the Supreme Court and shall serve as Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary. In addition, two judges of the circuit court are to be appointed to this body, who shall be selected by the Circuit Judges' Association; together with one district judge, who shall be selected by the District Judges' Association. Other members of the Court of the Judiciary are: two members of the state bar, who shall be selected by the governing body of the [[Alabama State Bar]]; three persons (as of 2005) who are not lawyers who shall be appointed by the Governor; and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Members appointed by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be subject to Senate confirmation before serving.\n\nThe Court of the Judiciary is convened to hear complaints filed by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. It has authority, after notice and public hearing, to impose one of two penalties:\n*To remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his or her duties, or\n*To suspend with or without pay, or to retire a judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform his duties.<ref>''Constitution of Alabama of 1901, Amendment 581, \u00a76.18''.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Alabama Legislature}}\nLike other states within the United States, Alabama has a [[State legislature (United States)|legislative branch]].\n\n===House of Representatives===\n{{main|Alabama House of Representatives}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama House of Representatives]] is composed of 105 members, all elected from single-member districts of equal population across the state in the same cycle.  Each member represents a district of approximately 40,000 people,<ref>Article IV, Section 50 of the [[Alabama Constitution]].</ref>  and is elected to a four-year term. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] is currently [[Mac McCutcheon (Alabama politician)|Mac McCutcheon]], a Republican.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201234723/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/houseleaders.html ]</ref>  The current partisan line-up of the House of Representatives is 72 Republicans and 33 Democrats.\n\nAll revenue-raising matters must originate in the Alabama House. A majority of a quorum can pass any bill except a constitutional amendment, which requires a three-fifths vote of all those elected.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Senate===\n{{main|Alabama Senate}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama Senate]] is composed of 35 Senators. Each Senator represents a single-member district of approximately 125,000 Alabamians.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years of age at the time of their election, must be citizens and residents of the state of Alabama for at least 3 years, and reside within their district for at least one year prior to election.<ref>Article IV, Section 47 of the Alabama Constitution]</ref>\n\nAll Senators are elected for four-year terms in the same cycle as the House of Representatives, the Governor, and other statewide constitutional officers.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives has exclusive power to originate revenue bills, such legislation can be amended and/or substituted by the Senate. Moreover, because the Senate is historically considered to be the \"deliberative body\", its rules concerning length of debate are more relaxed than those of the House of Representatives.  The Senate also has a history of filibusters that the rules of the lower house do not as easily tolerate.\n\nThe Alabama Senate has sole power of Confirmation of certain appointees designated by the Constitution and by statute.\n\n===Legislative sessions===\n\n====Regular sessions====\nThe [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]] convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except:\n\n*In the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March, and\n*In the last year of a four-year term, when the session begins on the second Tuesday in January.\n\nThe length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Generally, two meeting or \"legislative\" days are held per week, with other days being devoted to committee meetings. The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n== Seals of the Government of Alabama ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Governor-Elect of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[President-elect|Governor-Elect]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Speaker of the House of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Speaker of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\nFile:Seal of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Courts of Alabama|Unified Judicial System]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Attorney General of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Attorney General of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.svg|Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.svg|Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Corrections.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Corrections]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Homeland Security]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Health.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Health]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Safety.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department.svg|Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department\nFile:Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Alabama National Guard.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama National Guard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elections in Alabama]]\n*[[Courts of Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://governor.state.al.us/ Governor's Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920100305/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/ Legislature Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050917073603/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/ Judicial Office Website]\n*{{Ballotpedia|Alabama|Alabama}}\n\n{{Alabama}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Alabama| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Alabama]]\n", "name_user": "AveryRedPandaGirl", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eGeneral information)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Alabama"}

He is known for his three-volume work ''Gnosis: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy''.<ref name=\"inner\">Smoley, Richard, ''Inner Christianity: A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition''. Boston: Shambhala, 2002, p.41.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early years: Russia ===\nBoris Mouravieff was born in Kronstadt, Imperial Russia, on 8th March 1890. He was the second of Count Piotr Petrovitch Mouravieff's three sons. His father was an [[Admiral]] and [[Secretary of State]] to the [[Russian Imperial Navy]]. His ancestor's included General Prince [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviev-Karsski | Nicolas Mouravieff -Karski]], [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A. N. Mouravieff (author)), General Count [[Mikha\u00efl Mouraviov-Vilenski | Michel Mouravieff-Vilenski]] and General Count [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviov-Amourski | Nicolas Mouravieff-Amourski]].\n\nA commissioned officer of the Imperial Russian Naval Academy Mouravieff rose through the ranks, in particular from 1909 to 1912 when he served aboard the [[Russian cruiser Aurora]]. Aurora won fame in 1917, giving the signal for the start of the [[February Revolution | Bolshevik Revolution]]. During the [[First World War]], he served in the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. Promoted to lieutenant commander in 1916, he commanded a flotilla of fast torpedo boats of which he had been the designer and the promoter.\n\nIn March 1917 at the age of 27, he was promoted to frigate captain, before being appointed Principal Private Secretary to [[Alexander Kerensky]] in the first provisional government, led by Prince [[Georgy Lvov]]. Following this he was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Black Sea fleet by Kerensky, who in turn became head of the Russian government until his overthrow by the Bolsheviks during the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. Shortly after the signing of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], in 1918, he left the military but remained in [[Crimea]] to devote himself to business interests, archaeological work as well as esoteric and historical research.\n\nAt the end of 1920, Mouravieff left Russia for [[Constantinople]] and in 1922 he moved again to [[Bulgaria]] until 1924.\n\nSince his youth, Mouravieff had been interested in the esoteric tradition of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Assisted by indications left by [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A.N. Mouravieff), his great-uncle (who died in 1874) and a founder of the [[Skete of Saint Andrew]], one of the great Orthodox monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. The latter had undertaken research in [[Egypt]], [[Armenia]], [[Kurdistan]] and even [[Persia]] to find traces of this tradition and manuscripts from the first centuries of our [[Common Era]].\n\n=== Exile ===\nWhile in Constantinople between 1920-21 Mouravieff attended public lectures given by [[P. D. Ouspensky]] and became acquainted with [[Gurdjieff]], whom he had contact with in later years both at [[Fontainebleau]] and in [[Paris]]. Mouravieff and Ouspensky became close friends and worked together either in Paris or London for many years most notably on the manuscript of [[In Search of the Miraculous]]. They met for the last time at Lyne Place Manor <ref> https://www.ouspenskytoday.org/wp/chronology/1931-1941-london-gadsden-lyne/lyne-place-house-and-history/</ref>, near London, in May 1937. Boris Mouravieff specifies the nature of his links with Ouspensky and GI Gurdjieff in a study published in 1957: \u201cOuspensky, Gurdjieff and the Fragments of a teaching unknown \u201d(in Revue\u201c Synth\u00e8ses \u201d, Brussels). This article is taken up in a work published by Dervy in September 2008 under the title \"Writings on Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and on the Christian Esoteric Tradition\".\n\n=== In France ===\nIn 1924, Boris Mouravieff arrived in [[France]] as a refugee. He first resides in Paris, then settles in [[Bordeaux]]. In 1935, he met Larissa Bassof-Volkoff, born in 1901 in [[Tashkent]], in [[Uzbekistan]]. She is a ballerina and mother of a child from a first marriage, Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, born in 1928 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine | Neuilly]]. Boris Mouravieff married her in 1936 and all three moved to Paris the same year.\n\nSince 1921, Boris Mouravieff has pursued his research relating to the political and diplomatic history of Russia, and in particular to [[Peter I the Great | Pierre the Great]], which will give rise to the publication of several works.\n\nUntil 1941, he worked as a consulting engineer for various oil companies, while devoting his free time to his historical research, as well as to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nOn June 11, 1940, Boris Mouravieff left Paris for [[Carry-le-Rouet]] in the South of France, where the firm that employed him had relocated. He then moved to [[Aix-en-Provence]] until July 1943, and finally to [[Haute-Savoie]], [[Neuvecelle]], above [[Evian]]. Refusing to collaborate with the Germans, he was arrested in early 1944 by the [[Gestapo]], interned in [[Annemasse]], then released under surveillance.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nAt this point resistance fighters of the French Gendarmerie in the department organised his flight and that of his family on March 9, 1944 for [[Switzerland]]. Received as refugees, Boris and Larissa Mouravieff are first assigned to residence in a refugee camp in [[Randa]] in [[Valais]]. At the end of the war, they were allowed to settle in Geneva in an establishment called \"Home for intellectual refugees\", while waiting to occupy an apartment in town.\n\nBoris Mouravieff is 55 years old. He has to start from scratch again. His material situation is precarious: he hardly earns his living by means of lessons and industrial translations.\n\nAs early as April 1945, Boris Mouravieff applied for enrolment as a student at the [[Institute for Advanced International and Development Studies | Institute for Advanced International Studies]] in Geneva. In 1951, he graduated from this institute for his work: \"The Russian-Turkish Alliance in the Middle of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\".\n\nAround the same time, his wife opened the \"Larissa Mouravieff Classical Dance School\", which she ran for a quarter of a century. At the beginning, Boris Mouravieff participated by accompanying the lessons, on the piano.\n\nDuring this period, he undertook work to formalize the esoteric Christian tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. He initially planned to present this doctrine in romantic form (unfinished manuscript: \"Initiation - The life and dreams of Boris Kouratov\").\n\n=== Teaching ===\nIn April 1955, Boris Mouravieff becomes [[privat-docent]] at [[University of Geneva]] where he gives two courses until 1961, one concerning the history of Russia before 1917 and the other esoteric philosophy. This last course will be entitled precisely: \"Introduction to esoteric philosophy according to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy\". It will regularly bring together between ten and thirty students. The introductory speech of the 1956 academic year on the theme of \"The Problem of the New Man\" will be published by the journal \"Syntheses\". Other articles will follow this first publication.\n\nThe teaching provided at the University of Geneva served as the basis for writing his master work, \"Gn\u00f4sis\", the first volume of which was published in April 1961 by the editions \"La Colombe\" in Paris. The mastery and the clarity of the presentation were recognized and the work obtained the following year the price of esoteric literature [[Victor-\u00c9mile Michelet]]. A rigorous and concrete spirit, Boris Mouravieff presents and comments, through this work, the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy in a language that is clear and accessible to a cultivated person of our time.\n\nThat same year, 1961, Boris Mouravieff created the Center for Esoteric Christian Studies (C.E.C.E.), based in Geneva, which he chaired and led until his death. The main goal assigned to the C.E.C.E. was to contribute to the formation of the New Man whom Boris Mouravieff wished for, in a critical historical period - ours - which he qualified as\n\"Transition period\", between a cycle which is ending and a new cycle, carrying promises as much as heavy dangers.\n\nFollowing the publication of volume I of '' Gn\u00f4sis '', Boris Mouravieff receives a voluminous correspondence. He does not just respond to people interested in the education disclosed in \"Gn\u00f4sis\": he encourages the creation of study groups that are emerging in Geneva, Paris, [[Lille]], [[Brussels] ], [[Cairo]], at {{lh | Congo}}, etc. These groups, formed under the aegis of the C.E.C.E., aimed to jointly deepen the doctrine set out in Gn\u00f4sis.\n\nIn 1962, Boris Mouravieff took leave of the University of Geneva to devote himself entirely to the activities of the Center and to the writing of the last two volumes of the trilogy of \"Gn\u00f4sis\". Volume II appeared in 1962, volume III in 1965.\n\nWithin the framework of the C.E.C.E., Boris Mouravieff sees his audience widened to multiple groups whose work he follows, personally responding to the collective or individual questioning of their members. Visits will support the activity of certain groups such as Paris, Lille or Brussels. In the same way, he made a trip to [[Greece]] in July 1964 (A translation of \"Gn\u00f4sis\" in Greek was made following this trip).\n\nTo inform the groups and coordinate their work, \"Information Bulletins\" are periodically published by the C.E.C.E. for members. The development of the activity of the C.E.C.E. was made possible thanks to a patronage which made it possible to have the necessary material means.\n\nThe last years of Boris Mouravieff's life are devoted to this teaching activity. In a perspective of clarification, deepening and practical application, he undertook the writing of a \u201cCollection of Notes on esoteric Christian teaching: The Stromata\u201d, in imitation of [[Clement of Alexandria] ]. With these Stromates, grouped under the general title of \"The Art of Winning\", Boris Mouravieff embarks on a vast and ambitious project. The aim was to supplement the teaching given in \"Gn\u00f4sis\" with practical elements answering the questions that the study of doctrine raised among students. The first chapter appeared in 1966. Two other chapters were published posthumously.\n\n=== Death ===\nThis intense activity has an impact on Boris Mouravieff's state of health. In March 1965, already, a heart attack imposed him a short rest in Cannes. In June 1966, he was struck down by a crisis of rheumatoid arthritis accompanied by severe pain which forced him to live in bed.\n\nBoris Mouravieff died in Geneva of a [[heart attack]] on September 28, 1966, at 8.15 p.m., at the age of 76. He rests at [[Geneva # Saint-Georges | Saint-Georges cemetery]], in Geneva <ref> At N \u00b0 2071, District 3, of the St-Georges Cemetery,\nPlateau de Saint-Georges - 1 avenue du Cimeti\u00e8re, 1213 Petit-Lancy (Geneva). </ref>.\n\nThe C.E.C.E. ceases operations shortly after the death of its founder.\n\n=== Posterity ===\nHis widow, Larissa Mouravieff published chapters 2 and 3 of the first \"Stromate\" in 1968 and 1970. She watches over the archives of the Center and, in 1988, has them deposited at the [[Library of Geneva | Public and University Library of Geneva]] before leaving for [[Canada]] to join her son. Larissa Mouravieff died in [[Montreal]] on September 26, 1989, leaving Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, sole heir of rights. When the latter died, in March 2012, the remaining archives were handed over to the Library of Geneva (BGE, department of manuscripts), where a Mouravieff collection had been set up, which could be consulted by researchers who request it.\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Political and Diplomatic History (in French)'''\n* ''L\u2019histoire de Russie mal connue'' (\u00e9puis\u00e9).\n* ''Le Testament de Pierre le Grand, l\u00e9gende et r\u00e9alit\u00e9'', \u00e0 la Baconni\u00e8re, Collection \u00ab L\u2019\u00e9volution du monde et des id\u00e9es \u00bb.

He is known for his three-volume work ''Gnosis: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy''.<ref name=\"inner\">Smoley, Richard, ''Inner Christianity: A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition''. Boston: Shambhala, 2002, p.41.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early years: Russia ===\nBoris Mouravieff was born in Kronstadt, Imperial Russia, on 8th March 1890. He was the second of Count Piotr Petrovitch Mouravieff's three sons. His father was an [[Admiral]] and [[Secretary of State]] to the [[Russian Imperial Navy]]. His ancestor's included General Prince [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviev-Karsski | Nicolas Mouravieff -Karski]], [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A. N. Mouravieff (author)), General Count [[Mikha\u00efl Mouraviov-Vilenski | Michel Mouravieff-Vilenski]] and General Count [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviov-Amourski | Nicolas Mouravieff-Amourski]].\n\nA commissioned officer of the Imperial Russian Naval Academy Mouravieff rose through the ranks, in particular from 1909 to 1912 when he served aboard the [[Russian cruiser Aurora]]. Aurora won fame in 1917, giving the signal for the start of the [[February Revolution | Bolshevik Revolution]]. During the [[First World War]], he served in the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. Promoted to lieutenant commander in 1916, he commanded a flotilla of fast torpedo boats of which he had been the designer and the promoter.\n\nIn March 1917 at the age of 27, he was promoted to frigate captain, before being appointed Principal Private Secretary to [[Alexander Kerensky]] in the first provisional government, led by Prince [[Georgy Lvov]]. Following this he was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Black Sea fleet by Kerensky, who in turn became head of the Russian government until his overthrow by the Bolsheviks during the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. Shortly after the signing of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], in 1918, he left the military but remained in [[Crimea]] to devote himself to business interests, archaeological work as well as esoteric and historical research.\n\nAt the end of 1920, Mouravieff left Russia for [[Constantinople]] and in 1922 he moved again to [[Bulgaria]] until 1924.\n\nSince his youth, Mouravieff had been interested in the esoteric tradition of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Assisted by indications left by [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov]] (A.N. Mouravieff), his great-uncle (who died in 1874) and a founder of the [[Skete of Saint Andrew]], one of the great Orthodox monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. The latter had undertaken research in [[Egypt]], [[Armenia]], [[Kurdistan]] and even [[Persia]] to find traces of this tradition and manuscripts from the first centuries of our [[Common Era]].\n\n=== Exile ===\nIn Constantinople, in 1920-21, Boris Mouravieff attended public lectures given by [[P. D. Ouspensky]]. This is where the latter puts Boris Mouravieff in touch with [[Gurdjieff]], with whom he will later have several contacts, at [[Fontainebleau]] and [[Paris]], without having been his disciple . For many years, Boris Mouravieff and Ouspensky, linked by a friendship based on the same spirit of research, will be brought to deepen and compare their work during their meetings in Paris or in [[London]]. They will meet for the last time at the castle of Lyne, near London, in May 1937. Boris Mouravieff specifies the nature of his links with Ouspensky and GI Gurdjieff in a study published in 1957: \u201cOuspensky, Gurdjieff and the Fragments of a teaching unknown \u201d(in Revue\u201c Synth\u00e8ses \u201d, Brussels). This article is taken up in a work published by Dervy in September 2008 under the title \"Writings on Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and on the Christian Esoteric Tradition\".\n\n=== In France ===\nIn 1924, Boris Mouravieff arrived in [[France]] as a refugee. He first resides in Paris, then settles in [[Bordeaux]]. In 1935, he met Larissa Bassof-Volkoff, born in 1901 in [[Tashkent]], in [[Uzbekistan]]. She is a ballerina and mother of a child from a first marriage, Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, born in 1928 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine | Neuilly]]. Boris Mouravieff married her in 1936 and all three moved to Paris the same year.\n\nSince 1921, Boris Mouravieff has pursued his research relating to the political and diplomatic history of Russia, and in particular to [[Peter I the Great | Pierre the Great]], which will give rise to the publication of several works.\n\nUntil 1941, he worked as a consulting engineer for various oil companies, while devoting his free time to his historical research, as well as to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nOn June 11, 1940, Boris Mouravieff left Paris for [[Carry-le-Rouet]] in the South of France, where the firm that employed him had relocated. He then moved to [[Aix-en-Provence]] until July 1943, and finally to [[Haute-Savoie]], [[Neuvecelle]], above [[Evian]]. Refusing to collaborate with the Germans, he was arrested in early 1944 by the [[Gestapo]], interned in [[Annemasse]], then released under surveillance.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nAt this point resistance fighters of the French Gendarmerie in the department organised his flight and that of his family on March 9, 1944 for [[Switzerland]]. Received as refugees, Boris and Larissa Mouravieff are first assigned to residence in a refugee camp in [[Randa]] in [[Valais]]. At the end of the war, they were allowed to settle in Geneva in an establishment called \"Home for intellectual refugees\", while waiting to occupy an apartment in town.\n\nBoris Mouravieff is 55 years old. He has to start from scratch again. His material situation is precarious: he hardly earns his living by means of lessons and industrial translations.\n\nAs early as April 1945, Boris Mouravieff applied for enrolment as a student at the [[Institute for Advanced International and Development Studies | Institute for Advanced International Studies]] in Geneva. In 1951, he graduated from this institute for his work: \"The Russian-Turkish Alliance in the Middle of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\".\n\nAround the same time, his wife opened the \"Larissa Mouravieff Classical Dance School\", which she ran for a quarter of a century. At the beginning, Boris Mouravieff participated by accompanying the lessons, on the piano.\n\nDuring this period, he undertook work to formalize the esoteric Christian tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. He initially planned to present this doctrine in romantic form (unfinished manuscript: \"Initiation - The life and dreams of Boris Kouratov\").\n\n=== Teaching ===\nIn April 1955, Boris Mouravieff becomes [[privat-docent]] at [[University of Geneva]] where he gives two courses until 1961, one concerning the history of Russia before 1917 and the other esoteric philosophy. This last course will be entitled precisely: \"Introduction to esoteric philosophy according to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy\". It will regularly bring together between ten and thirty students. The introductory speech of the 1956 academic year on the theme of \"The Problem of the New Man\" will be published by the journal \"Syntheses\". Other articles will follow this first publication.\n\nThe teaching provided at the University of Geneva served as the basis for writing his master work, \"Gn\u00f4sis\", the first volume of which was published in April 1961 by the editions \"La Colombe\" in Paris. The mastery and the clarity of the presentation were recognized and the work obtained the following year the price of esoteric literature [[Victor-\u00c9mile Michelet]]. A rigorous and concrete spirit, Boris Mouravieff presents and comments, through this work, the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy in a language that is clear and accessible to a cultivated person of our time.\n\nThat same year, 1961, Boris Mouravieff created the Center for Esoteric Christian Studies (C.E.C.E.), based in Geneva, which he chaired and led until his death. The main goal assigned to the C.E.C.E. was to contribute to the formation of the New Man whom Boris Mouravieff wished for, in a critical historical period - ours - which he qualified as\n\"Transition period\", between a cycle which is ending and a new cycle, carrying promises as much as heavy dangers.\n\nFollowing the publication of volume I of '' Gn\u00f4sis '', Boris Mouravieff receives a voluminous correspondence. He does not just respond to people interested in the education disclosed in \"Gn\u00f4sis\": he encourages the creation of study groups that are emerging in Geneva, Paris, [[Lille]], [[Brussels] ], [[Cairo]], at {{lh | Congo}}, etc. These groups, formed under the aegis of the C.E.C.E., aimed to jointly deepen the doctrine set out in Gn\u00f4sis.\n\nIn 1962, Boris Mouravieff took leave of the University of Geneva to devote himself entirely to the activities of the Center and to the writing of the last two volumes of the trilogy of \"Gn\u00f4sis\". Volume II appeared in 1962, volume III in 1965.\n\nWithin the framework of the C.E.C.E., Boris Mouravieff sees his audience widened to multiple groups whose work he follows, personally responding to the collective or individual questioning of their members. Visits will support the activity of certain groups such as Paris, Lille or Brussels. In the same way, he made a trip to [[Greece]] in July 1964 (A translation of \"Gn\u00f4sis\" in Greek was made following this trip).\n\nTo inform the groups and coordinate their work, \"Information Bulletins\" are periodically published by the C.E.C.E. for members. The development of the activity of the C.E.C.E. was made possible thanks to a patronage which made it possible to have the necessary material means.\n\nThe last years of Boris Mouravieff's life are devoted to this teaching activity. In a perspective of clarification, deepening and practical application, he undertook the writing of a \u201cCollection of Notes on esoteric Christian teaching: The Stromata\u201d, in imitation of [[Clement of Alexandria] ]. With these Stromates, grouped under the general title of \"The Art of Winning\", Boris Mouravieff embarks on a vast and ambitious project. The aim was to supplement the teaching given in \"Gn\u00f4sis\" with practical elements answering the questions that the study of doctrine raised among students. The first chapter appeared in 1966. Two other chapters were published posthumously.\n\n=== Death ===\nThis intense activity has an impact on Boris Mouravieff's state of health. In March 1965, already, a heart attack imposed him a short rest in Cannes. In June 1966, he was struck down by a crisis of rheumatoid arthritis accompanied by severe pain which forced him to live in bed.\n\nBoris Mouravieff died in Geneva of a [[heart attack]] on September 28, 1966, at 8.15 p.m., at the age of 76. He rests at [[Geneva # Saint-Georges | Saint-Georges cemetery]], in Geneva <ref> At N \u00b0 2071, District 3, of the St-Georges Cemetery,\nPlateau de Saint-Georges - 1 avenue du Cimeti\u00e8re, 1213 Petit-Lancy (Geneva). </ref>.\n\nThe C.E.C.E. ceases operations shortly after the death of its founder.\n\n=== Posterity ===\nHis widow, Larissa Mouravieff published chapters 2 and 3 of the first \"Stromate\" in 1968 and 1970. She watches over the archives of the Center and, in 1988, has them deposited at the [[Library of Geneva | Public and University Library of Geneva]] before leaving for [[Canada]] to join her son. Larissa Mouravieff died in [[Montreal]] on September 26, 1989, leaving Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, sole heir of rights. When the latter died, in March 2012, the remaining archives were handed over to the Library of Geneva (BGE, department of manuscripts), where a Mouravieff collection had been set up, which could be consulted by researchers who request it.\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Political and Diplomatic History (in French)'''\n* ''L\u2019histoire de Russie mal connue'' (\u00e9puis\u00e9).\n* ''Le Testament de Pierre le Grand, l\u00e9gende et r\u00e9alit\u00e9'', \u00e0 la Baconni\u00e8re, Collection \u00ab L\u2019\u00e9volution du monde et des id\u00e9es \u00bb.
