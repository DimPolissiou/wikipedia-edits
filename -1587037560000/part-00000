Exposure to exogenous oxidizing drugs and their metabolites (such as benzocaine, dapsone, and nitrates) may lead to an increase of up to a thousandfold of the methemoglobin formation rate, overwhelming the protective enzyme systems and acutely increasing methemoglobin levels.\n\nInfants under 6 months of age have lower levels of a key methemoglobin reduction enzyme ([[cytochrome b5 reductase|NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase]]) in their red blood cells.

Instead of being red in color, the arterial blood of met-Hb patients is brown. This results in the skin of [[White people|Caucasian]] patients gaining a bluish hue. Hereditary met-Hb is caused by a [[recessive gene]]. If only one parent has this gene, offspring will have normal-hued skin, but if both parents carry the gene, there is a chance the offspring will have blue-hued skin.\n\nAnother cause of congenital methemoglobinemia is seen in patients with abnormal hemoglobin variants such as hemoglobin M (HbM), or [[Hemoglobin h|hemoglobin H (HbH)]], which are not amenable to [[redox|reduction]] despite intact enzyme systems.\n\nMethemoglobinemia can also arise in patients with [[pyruvate kinase deficiency]] due to impaired production of [[NADH]]  \u2013 the essential cofactor for diaphorase I. Similarly, patients with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] may have impaired production of another co-factor, [[NADPH]].\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nThe affinity for oxygen of ferric iron is impaired. The binding of oxygen to methemoglobin results in an ''increased'' affinity for oxygen in the remaining heme sites that are in ferrous state within the same tetrameric hemoglobin unit.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Darling|first1=AU|last2=Roughton|first2=R|title=The effect of methemoglobin on the equilibrium between oxygen and hemoglobin|journal=Am J Physiol|date=1942|volume=137|page=56|doi=10.1152/ajplegacy.1942.137.1.56}}</ref>  This leads to an overall reduced ability of the red blood cell to release oxygen to tissues, with the associated [[oxygen\u2013haemoglobin dissociation curve|oxygen\u2013hemoglobin dissociation curve]] therefore shifted to the left. When methemoglobin concentration is elevated in [[red blood cells]], [[tissue hypoxia]] may occur.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajh.20738|pmid=16986127|title=Methemoglobin\u2014It's not just blue: A concise review|journal=American Journal of Hematology|volume=82|issue=2|pages=134\u2013144|year=2007|last1=Umbreit|first1=Jay|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/21923800ec0579f77655b09c3a5ba910e4f8ca64}}</ref>\n\nNormally, methemoglobin levels are <1%, as measured by the [[CO-oximeter|CO-oximetry test]]. Elevated levels of methemoglobin in the blood are caused when the mechanisms that defend against [[oxidative stress]] within the red blood cell are overwhelmed and the oxygen carrying [[ferrous|ferrous ion (Fe<sup>2+</sup>)]] of the [[heme]] group of the hemoglobin molecule is oxidized to the [[ferric|ferric state (Fe<sup>3+</sup>)]]. This converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin, resulting in a reduced ability to release oxygen to tissues and thereby hypoxia. This can give the blood a bluish or chocolate-brown color.\n\nSpontaneously formed methemoglobin is normally reduced (regenerating normal hemoglobin) by protective enzyme systems, e.g., NADH methemoglobin reductase ([[cytochrome-b5 reductase]]) (major pathway), NADPH methemoglobin reductase (minor pathway) and to a lesser extent the ascorbic acid and glutathione enzyme systems. Disruptions with these enzyme systems lead to methemoglobinemia.\n\nHypoxia occurs due to the decreased oxygen-binding capacity of methemoglobin, as well as the increased oxygen-binding affinity of other subunits in the same hemoglobin molecule, which prevents them from releasing oxygen at normal tissue oxygen levels.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:MethemoglobinDiag.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|Color chart for the detection of the amount of methemoglobin in the blood]]\nArterial blood with elevated methemoglobin levels has a characteristic chocolate-brown color as compared to normal bright red oxygen-containing arterial blood.<ref name=emedmed1466>{{cite web|title = eMedicine - Methemoglobinemia| url = http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1466.htm|accessdate = 2008-09-13}}</ref> If methemoglobinemia is suspected, an arterial blood gas and CO-oximetry panel should be obtained.\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\nOther conditions that can cause bluish skin include [[argyria]], [[sulfhemoglobinemia]], and [[heart failure]].<ref name=Stat2019/>\n\n==Treatment==\n[[File:Eplasty16ic18 fig1.jpg|thumb|Cyanosis from methemoglobinemia]]\n[[File:Eplasty16ic18 fig3.jpg|thumb|Resolved after methylene blue]]\n\nMethemoglobinemia can be treated with supplemental oxygen and [[methylene blue]].<ref name=\"pmid17572332\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yusim Y, Livingstone D, Sidi A |title=Blue dyes, blue people: the systemic effects of blue dyes when administered via different routes |journal=J Clin Anesth |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=315\u2013321 |year=2007 |pmid=17572332 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinane.2007.01.006 }}</ref> Methylene blue is given as a 1% solution (10&nbsp;mg/ml) 1 to 2&nbsp;mg/kg administered intravenously slowly over five minutes.

Exposure to exogenous oxidizing drugs and their metabolites (such as benzocaine, dapsone, and nitrates) may lead to an increase of up to a thousandfold of the methemoglobin formation rate, overwhelming the protective enzyme systems and acutely increasing methemoglobin levels.\n\nInfants under 6 months of age have lower levels of a key methemoglobin reduction enzyme ([[cytochrome b5 reductase|NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase]]) in their red blood cells.

Instead of being red in color, the arterial blood of met-Hb patients is brown. This results in the skin of [[White people|Caucasian]] patients gaining a bluish hue. Hereditary met-Hb is caused by a [[recessive gene]]. If only one parent has this gene, offspring will have normal-hued skin, but if both parents carry the gene, there is a chance the offspring will have blue-hued skin.\n\nAnother cause of congenital methemoglobinemia is seen in patients with abnormal hemoglobin variants such as hemoglobin M (HbM), or [[Hemoglobin h|hemoglobin H (HbH)]], which are not amenable to [[redox|reduction]] despite intact enzyme systems.\n\nMethemoglobinemia can also arise in patients with [[pyruvate kinase deficiency]] due to impaired production of [[NADH]]  \u2013 the essential cofactor for diaphorase I. Similarly, patients with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] may have impaired production of another co-factor, [[NADPH]].\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nThe affinity for oxygen of ferric iron is impaired. The binding of oxygen to methemoglobin results in an ''increased'' affinity for oxygen in the remaining heme sites that are in ferrous state within the same tetrameric hemoglobin unit.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Darling|first1=AU|last2=Roughton|first2=R|title=The effect of methemoglobin on the equilibrium between oxygen and hemoglobin|journal=Am J Physiol|date=1942|volume=137|page=56|doi=10.1152/ajplegacy.1942.137.1.56}}</ref>  This leads to an overall reduced ability of the red blood cell to release oxygen to tissues, with the associated [[oxygen\u2013haemoglobin dissociation curve|oxygen\u2013hemoglobin dissociation curve]] therefore shifted to the left.

Elevated levels of methemoglobin in the blood are caused when the mechanisms that defend against [[oxidative stress]] within the red blood cell are overwhelmed and the oxygen carrying [[ferrous|ferrous ion (Fe<sup>2+</sup>)]] of the [[heme]] group of the hemoglobin molecule is oxidized to the [[ferric|ferric state (Fe<sup>3+</sup>)]]. This converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin, resulting in a reduced ability to release oxygen to tissues and thereby hypoxia. This can give the blood a bluish or chocolate-brown color.\n\nSpontaneously formed methemoglobin is normally reduced (regenerating normal hemoglobin) by protective enzyme systems, e.g., NADH methemoglobin reductase ([[cytochrome-b5 reductase]]) (major pathway), NADPH methemoglobin reductase (minor pathway) and to a lesser extent the ascorbic acid and glutathione enzyme systems. Disruptions with these enzyme systems lead to methemoglobinemia.\n\nHypoxia occurs due to the decreased oxygen-binding capacity of methemoglobin, as well as the increased oxygen-binding affinity of other subunits in the same hemoglobin molecule, which prevents them from releasing oxygen at normal tissue oxygen levels.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:MethemoglobinDiag.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|Color chart for the detection of the amount of methemoglobin in the blood]]\nArterial blood with elevated methemoglobin levels has a characteristic chocolate-brown color as compared to normal bright red oxygen-containing arterial blood.<ref name=emedmed1466>{{cite web|title = eMedicine - Methemoglobinemia| url = http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1466.htm|accessdate = 2008-09-13}}</ref> If methemoglobinemia is suspected, an arterial blood gas and CO-oximetry panel should be obtained.\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\nOther conditions that can cause bluish skin include [[argyria]], [[sulfhemoglobinemia]], and [[heart failure]].<ref name=Stat2019/>\n\n==Treatment==\n[[File:Eplasty16ic18 fig1.jpg|thumb|Cyanosis from methemoglobinemia]]\n[[File:Eplasty16ic18 fig3.jpg|thumb|Resolved after methylene blue]]\n\nMethemoglobinemia can be treated with supplemental oxygen and [[methylene blue]].<ref name=\"pmid17572332\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yusim Y, Livingstone D, Sidi A |title=Blue dyes, blue people: the systemic effects of blue dyes when administered via different routes |journal=J Clin Anesth |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=315\u2013321 |year=2007 |pmid=17572332 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinane.2007.01.006 }}</ref> Methylene blue is given as a 1% solution (10&nbsp;mg/ml) 1 to 2&nbsp;mg/kg administered intravenously slowly over five minutes.

non-[[cognates]] when listening to Afrikaans than the other way round.<ref name=\"gooskens\" /><!--see page 460-->\n\nFor example, the Afrikaans sentence ''ons is uit die Land van Israel'' (\"we are from the Land of Israel\") would be understood by a Dutch speaker as meaning \"us is from that Land of Israel\", whereas the Dutch equivalent ''we komen uit het Land Isra\u00ebl'' would be less readily understood by an Afrikaans speaker as there are no words cognate with ''we'' or ''het''.\n\nIn Afrikaans, ''het'' is the inflection of the verb ''h\u00ea'' (\"to have\" from Dutch ''hebben'') although ''sy'' (cognate with ''zijn'') is used as the subjunctive of \"to be\", while ''we'' in Dutch is cognate with \"we\" in English, a language widely understood by Afrikaans speakers. Conversely, ''wees'', meaning \"to be\" in Afrikaans, is used as the imperative in Dutch, although it is used as the imperative in religious contexts in Afrikaans (e.g. ''wees genadig'', meaning \"be merciful\" or \"have mercy\").\n\n====Verb forms====\nThe simplification of verbs in Afrikaans, with almost all verbs being regular and the near absence of the simple past tense, means that while the phrase ''ek het gehelp'' (\"I have helped\" or \"I helped\") would be recognisable by Dutch speakers, the Dutch phrases ''ik heb geholpen'' and ''ik hielp'' would not be as readily understood by speakers of Afrikaans.\n\nSimilarly, the resemblance of Afrikaans verbs like ''lees'' (\"to read\", Dutch ''lezen'') to the first person singular and verbs like ''gaan'' (\"to go\") to infinitive forms in Dutch means that ''julle lees'' (\"you [plural] read\") or ''ek gaan'' (\"I go\") would be understood by Dutch speakers more readily than ''jullie lezen'' or ''ik ga'' would be by Afrikaans speakers.\n\n====Unmarked and marked forms of words====\nAs Afrikaans no longer has unmarked and marked forms of words, instead using words derived from the marked forms in Dutch, the Afrikaans words for \"there\" and \"now\", ''daar'' and ''nou'', are more intelligible to speakers of Dutch than the unmarked Dutch forms ''er'' and ''nu''  are to Afrikaans speakers.\n\nFor example, ''nou is daar'', meaning \"now there is\" in Afrikaans,<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Stemme/Menings/tim-du-plessis-nou-is-daar-geen-keuse-meer-nie-20160313 Tim du Plessis: Nou is daar geen keuse meer nie], [[News24|Netwerk 24]], 13 March 2016</ref> is sometimes encountered in Dutch<ref>[http://www.nu.nl/weekend/4019985/pieter-derks-verwerkt-maart-integriteitsakkefietjes.html Het leukste bericht van deze maand kwam van vliegbasis Volkel.], [[NU.nl]], 27 March 2015</ref> although ''nou'' is used more colloquially for emphasis, in the sense of the English \"well\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ilTCY6hePRkC&lpg=PA166&ots=_XGH0rtNmz&dq=nou%20nu%20dutch&pg=PA166#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Dubbel Dutch''], Kevin Cook, Kemper Conseil Publishing, 2002, page 166</ref> In Dutch, \"now there is\" would be translated as ''nu is er'', using the unmarked forms, which do not exist in Afrikaans.<ref>[http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/27085791/___Nu_is_er_helemaal_geen_flow_bij_PSV___.html 'Nu is er helemaal geen flow bij PSV'], ''[[De Telegraaf]]'', 22 November 2016</ref>\n\n===Intelligibility of Dutch to Afrikaans speakers===\n\n====Loanwords vs purisms====\nAfrikaans uses purisms or calques where Dutch would use loans from [[French language|French]], [[Latin]] or [[English language|English]]. Owing to the exposure of Afrikaans speakers to English, Dutch words like ''computer'', ''lift'' and ''appartement'' are more readily understood by them than Afrikaans equivalents like ''rekenaar'', ''hysbak'' and ''woonstel'' are by Dutch speakers.\n\nSimilarly, Dutch words such as ''favoriet'' (\"favourite\"), ''film'', and ''station'' are intelligible to Afrikaans speakers on account of their resemblance to their English equivalents, whereas the Afrikaans ''gunsteling'', ''rolprent'', and ''stasie'' (cognate with Dutch ''statie''), while intelligible to Dutch speakers, would be considered old-fashioned.\n\n====Words of Dutch and non-Dutch origin====\nIn addition, while Afrikaans may use words of non-Dutch origin unintelligible to Dutch speakers (such as those derived from [[Malay language|Malay]] like ''baie'', meaning \"very\" or \"much\", and ''amper'' meaning \"almost\" or \"nearly\"), their Dutch equivalents, or cognates, are also used in Afrikaans, and would therefore be more intelligible to Afrikaans speakers.\n\nFor example, although ''baie'', from ''banyak''<ref name=\"Mesthrie\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aIivedw-oZYC&lpg=PA214&ots=IW0w-cL9xz&dq=baie%20banyak&pg=PA214#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Language and Social History: Studies in South African Sociolinguistics''], Rajend Mesthrie\nNew Africa Books, 1995, page 214</ref> has no cognate in Dutch, ''heel'' as in ''heel goed'' (\"very good\") is used in Afrikaans as well as Dutch.<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Wereld/niks-kan-trump-masjien-nou-stuit-20160504 'Dit gaan 'heel goed' met die ekonoom Dawie Roodt n\u00e1 mesaanval'], [[News 24 (South Africa)|Netwerk24]], 25 July 2015</ref> The word ''amper'' is unrelated to the Dutch word ''amper'' (\"scarcely\" or \"sour\"), being derived from the Malay ''hampir'',<ref name=\"Mesthrie\" /> but the Dutch word ''bijna'', also meaning \"almost\" or \"nearly\",<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uVP1CAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA199&dq=%22bijna%22%20english%20%22almost%22&pg=PA216#v=onepage&q&f=true ''A Contrastive Grammar of English and Dutch / Contrastieve grammatica Engels / Nederlands''], F.

Thieme, 1832, page 90</ref>\n\nOther simplifications in Afrikaans had earlier been proposed for Dutch by R.A Kollewijn, but were either not adopted until 1934, such as changing {{angbr|sch}} to {{angbr|s}} (hence ''Nederlandsch'' to ''Nederlands''), or rejected, such as changing {{angbr|isch}} to {{angbr|ies}} (hence ''logisch'' to ''logies'') and {{angbr|ijk}} to {{angbr|ik}} (hence ''moeilijk'' to ''moeilik'').<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xo2MGkyEfbMC&lpg=PA170&dq=kollewijn%20spelling%20afrikaans&pg=PA170#v=onepage&q=kollewijn%20spelling%20afrikaans&f=true ''Dutch: Biography of a Language''], Roland Willemyns, Oxford University Press USA, page 170</ref>\n\n=== Afrikaans simplifications ===\n\n====Replacement of {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|ch}}====\nAfrikaans uses {{angbr|k}} for the Dutch hard {{angbr|c}}, both pronounced [[International Phonetic Alphabet|[ k ]]]; compare Dutch ''{{wiktnl|cultuur}}'' (\"culture\") with Afrikaans ''{{wiktaf|kultuur}}''. Before the 1990s major spelling reform, the latter spelling was also accepted in Dutch,<ref>[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1990/05/18/als-gegrift-6930363-a615439 Als gegrift], ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 18 May 1990</ref> although other Dutch words such as ''commissie'' (\"commission\") were already spelt with {{angbr|c}}, which in Afrikaans would be ''kommissie''.<ref>[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1994/01/27/beeindig-wederkeer-der-spellingcommissies-7211661-a386148 Be\u00ebindig wederkeer der spellingcommissies], ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 27 January 1994</ref>\n\nWords in Dutch with the letter combination {{angbr|cc}}, when pronounced as [[International Phonetic Alphabet|[ kk ]]] are transliterated in Afrikaans using {{angbr|kk}}, for example, ''acclimatiseren'' and ''accommodatie'' in Dutch become Afrikaans ''akklimatiseer'' and ''akkommodasie''. Those in which {{angbr|cc}} is pronounced as {{angbr|ks}}, such as Dutch ''accent'' and ''accepteren'', become ''aksent'' and ''aksepteer'' in Afrikaans.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1H6BP6SMMGkC&lpg=PP1&dq=afrikaans%20dictionary&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Afrikaans-English, English-Afrikaans Dictionary''], Jan Kromhout, Hippocrene Books, 2001, page 9</ref> \n  \nSimilarly, Afrikaans uses {{angbr|s}} for the Dutch soft {{angbr|c}}, both pronounced [[International Phonetic Alphabet|[ s ]]]; compare Dutch ''{{wiktnl|centraal}}'' (\"central\") and ''{{wiktnl|ceremonie}}'' (\"ceremony\") with Afrikaans ''{{wiktaf|sentraal}}'' and ''{{wiktnl|seremonie}}''. Afrikaans also uses {{angbr|s}} instead of {{angbr|c}} in words like ''spesiaal'' (\"special\") and ''spesifiek'' (\"specific\") which in Dutch would be ''speciaal'' and ''specifiek''.\n\nMost Afrikaans words using {{angbr|c}} begin with the digraph {{angbr|[[ch (digraph)|ch]]}}, pronounced [[International Phonetic Alphabet|[ x ]]], such as ''Christelik'' (\"Christian\") or ''chemie'' (\"chemistry\") with some exceptions like ''confetti'', although Afrikaans dictionaries may also list more phonetic alternative spellings using {{angbr|k}} or {{angbr|sj}}, such as ''kronies'' for ''chronies'' (\"chronic\", similar to Dutch ''chronisch'') and ''sjirurg'' for ''chirurg'' (\"surgeon\").<ref name=\"Kromhout30\" />\n\nHowever, although the Dutch words ''China'' and ''Chinees'' (inflected as ''Chinese'') are transliterated in Afrikaans using {{angbr|[[sj (digraph)|sj]]}} as ''Sjina'', ''Sjinees'', and ''Sjinese'' respectively,<ref>[http://news.nwu.ac.za/af/skool-vir-basiese-wetenskappe-verken-sjinees-japanese-geskiedenis Skool vir Basiese Wetenskappe verken Sjinees-Japanese geskiedenis], [[North-West University]], 16 September 2014</ref> the Dutch spellings are also used, particularly in the media.<ref>[http://landbou.com/nuus/china-raak-sku-vir-sa-ingelegde-vrugte/ China raak sku vir SA ingelegde vrugte], ''Landbou'', 18 December 2015</ref> In some Afrikaans dictionaries, ''China'' is standard, while ''Sjinees'' is listed as an alternative spelling to ''Chinees''.<ref name=\"Kromhout30\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1H6BP6SMMGkC&lpg=PP1&dq=afrikaans%20dictionary&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Afrikaans-English, English-Afrikaans Dictionary''], Jan Kromhout, Hippocrene Books, 2001, page 30</ref>\n\n====Transliteration of loanwords====\nFrench loanwords in Dutch beginning in {{angbr|[[ch (digraph)|ch]]}} (pronounced [[International Phonetic Alphabet|[ \u0283 ]]]), are transliterated in Afrikaans using {{angbr|[[sj (digraph)|sj]]}}; compare Dutch ''champagne'' and ''chic'' with Afrikaans ''sjampanje'' and ''sjiek''.<ref name=\"Donaldson2014\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jnFsBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA6&ots=LWxqTeNXho&dq=sjampanje%20afrikaans&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=sjampanje%20afrikaans&f=true ''Colloquial Afrikaans: The Complete Course for Beginners''], Bruce Donaldson, Routledge, 2014, page 6</ref> Afrikaans also changes {{angbr|gn}}, encountered in French loanwords in Dutch like ''campagne'' and ''compagnie'' to {{angbr|nj}}, hence ''kampanje'' and ''kompanjie''.\n\nWhen {{angbr|[[ch (digraph)|ch]]}} (pronounced [[International Phonetic Alphabet|[ \u0283 ]]]) appears within a Dutch word, in its Afrikaans equivalent, it is replaced by {{angbr|[[sj (digraph)|sj]]}}; compare ''{{wiktnl|machine}}'' with ''{{wiktaf|masjien}}''.<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Wereld/niks-kan-trump-masjien-nou-stuit-20160504 'Niks kan Trump-masjien nou stuit'], [[News 24 (South Africa)|Netwerk24]], 4 May 2016</ref> This also applies to word endings; compare Dutch ''Jiddisch'' (\"[[Yiddish]]\") with Afrikaans ''Jiddisj'',<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=77sMAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA19&dq=afrikaans%20jiddisj&pg=PA19#v=onepage&q=afrikaans%20jiddisj&f=false ''n Vaste plek vir Afrikaans: taaluitdagings op kampus''], Hermann Buhr Giliomee, Lawrence Schlemmer, African Sun Media, 2006, 19</ref> although the latter is also encountered in Dutch.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q2cZAQAAIAAJ&dq=jiddisch+nederlands&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=jiddisj ''Kroniek van het Jiddisj: taalkundige aspecten van achttiende-eeuws Nederlands Jiddisj''], Ariane Zwiers, Eburon, 2003</ref> In Dutch, ''hasjiesj'' (\"hashish\") is always written with {{angbr|[[sj (digraph)|sj]]}} similar to ''hasjisj'' in Afrikaans.<ref name=\"Donaldson2014\" />\n\nThe Dutch word ''cheque'', in which {{angbr|[[ch (digraph)|ch]]}} is pronounced as [[International Phonetic Alphabet|[ t\u0283 ]]], is written in Afrikaans as ''tjek'', while the [[Italian language|Italian]]-derived word ''cello'' is written as ''tjello''.

An example is ''{{wiktnl|prijs}}'' (price), which is spelt ''prys'' in Afrikaans. Dutch words ''ending'' in {{angbr|lijk}}, however, end in {{angbr|lik}} in Afrikaans, not {{angbr|lyk}}, for example ''{{wiktnl|lelijk}}'' (ugly) in Dutch becomes ''{{wiktaf|lelik}}'' in Afrikaans. In both languages, this suffix is pronounced {{IPA|[l\u0259k]}}, with a [[schwa]].\n\nIn Dutch, in which {{angbr|[[IJ (digraph)|ij]]}} is treated as a separate [[Dutch alphabet|letter of the alphabet]], ''IJ'' often features in place names in the Netherlands like [[IJsselmeer]], or in the Dutch name for [[Iceland]], ''IJsland''. Afrikaans similarly uses ''Ysland'',<ref>[http://www.sarie.com/lewe-liefdes/hieroor-praat-mense/besoek-aan-ysland/ My besoek aan Ysland], ''[[Sarie]]'', 12 August 2013</ref> which was also used in 18th century Dutch.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3JpaAAAAcAAJ&lpg=RA1-PP3&ots=b1axfSbbnV&dq=%22Ysland%22&pg=RA1-PP3#v=onepage&q=%22Ysland%22&f=false ''Beschryving van Ysland, Groenland en de Straat Davis''], Johann Anderson, D. J. J., Niels Horrebow, Johann Dietrich Winckler, Jan van Dalen, 1756</ref>\n\nHowever, few place names in South Africa of Dutch origin begin with ''Y'', with the exception of [[Yzerfontein]] in the [[Western Cape]]. The spelling of name of the town, which means ''iron fountain'', is based on the old Dutch word for iron, ''yzer''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jj5EAAAAcAAJ&dq=%22yzer%22&pg=RA4-PA97#v=onepage&q=%22yzer%22&f=true ''Lexicon Hieroglyphicum Sacro-Profanum Of Woordboek Van Gewyde en Ongewyde Voor- En Zinnebeelden''], Martinus Koning, Van Braam, 1717, page 97</ref> It was also previously written as Ijsterfontein.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/recordsofcapecol00thea Records of the Cape Colony],\nGeorge McCall Theal, Clowes, 1837-1919</ref> The modern Afrikaans word for iron is ''yster'', while in Dutch it is ''ijzer''.\t \n  \nIn modern Dutch, {{angbr|y}} is now typically used in words of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin like ''cyclus'' (\"cycle\") replaced by {{angbr|i}} in its Afrikaans equivalent ''siklus'', although both are pronounced as {{IPA|[i]}}. However, unlike the {{angbr|y}} in Dutch ''syndroom'' (\"syndrome\"), the {{angbr|i}} in  Afrikaans ''sindroom'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[\u0259]}}, as is the rule for the short i in Afrikaans in general.\n\n==== Mergers of digraphs or trigraphs ====\nAfrikaans merged Dutch trigraphs {{angbr|tie}}, {{angbr|cie}} and {{angbr|sie}} to a single spelling {{angbr|sie}}. Apart from {{angbr|tie}}, generally pronounced as {{IPA|[tsi]}} in the Netherlands, there is no difference in pronunciation; compare Dutch ''{{wiktnl|provincie}}'' (\"province\") and ''{{wiktnl|politie}}'' (\"police\") with Afrikaans ''{{wiktaf|provinsie}}'' and ''{{wiktaf|polisie}}''. However, words ending in {{angbr|tie}} in Dutch are often pronounced as {{IPA|[si]}} particularly in [[Flanders]].<ref name=\"OT99\">[http://cf.hum.uva.nl/poldernederlands/abn_nederlands/twee_uitspraaknormen.html \u00c9\u00e9n taal, twee uitspraaknormen], ''Onze Taal'', June 1999, pages 148-150</ref>\n\nAfrikaans merged Dutch digraphs and trigraphs {{angbr|ou}}, {{angbr|ouw}}, {{angbr|au}}, and {{angbr|auw}} (pronounced identically as {{IPA|/\u0251\u028a/}} by many Dutch speakers) to a single spelling {{angbr|ou}}, (contrasingly pronounced {{IPA|/\u0153u/}}); ''{{wiktnl|vrouw}}'' (\"woman\") and ''{{wiktnl|dauw}}'' (\"dew\") in Dutch become ''{{wiktaf|vrou}}'' and ''{{wiktaf|dou}}'' in Afrikaans respectively. Similarly, some Dutch words beginning with {{angbr|au}}, such as ''autonomie'' are written with {{angbr|ou}}, hence \n''outonomie''. \n\nThe Dutch cluster {{angbr|tion}} became {{angbr|sion}} in Afrikaans. Compare ''{{wiktnl|nationaal}}'' (\"national\") with ''{{wiktaf|nasionaal}}''. In Dutch, the pronunciation differs from region to region and include {{IPA|[tsi\u0254n]}}, {{IPA|[si\u0254n]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0283on]}}.\n\nConversely, the Afrikaans cluster {{angbr|si}} in words such as ''spesiaal'' (\"special\") and ''pensioen'' (\"pension\") is pronounced as {{IPA|[\u0283i]}} with an extra syllable  {{angbr|i}}, but in Dutch, both the {{angbr|ci}} in ''speciaal'' and {{angbr|si}} in ''pensioen'' are pronounced as {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, although the pronunciation {{IPA|[\u0283j]}} is encountered in the [[Southern Netherlands]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iG-Y04tngq8C&lpg=PA108&ots=_vk0lefOj2&dq=uitspraak%20politie%20vlaanderen&pg=PA108#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Nederlands in het perspectief van uitspraakverwerving en contrastieve taalkunde''], Laurent Rasier, Academia Press, 2011, page 108</ref>\n\n==== Dropping of final letters ====\nAt the end of words, Afrikaans often dropped the {{angbr|n}} in the Dutch cluster {{angbr|en}} (pronounced as a schwa, {{IPA|[\u0259]}}), mainly present in plural nouns and verb forms, to become {{angbr|e}} Compare Dutch ''{{wiktnl|leven}}'' (life) and ''{{wiktnl|mensen}}'' (people) to Afrikaans ''{{wiktaf|lewe}}'' and ''{{wiktaf|mense}}''. Also in Dutch, final -n is often deleted after a schwa, but the occurrence and frequency of this phenomenon varies between speakers, and it is not recognised in spelling.\n\n=== Phonetically induced spelling differences ===\n\n====Simplification of consonant clusters====\nAfrikaans has frequently simplified [[consonant cluster]]s in final position that are still present in Dutch, although they are used in inflected forms of adjectives, for example, ''bes'' (\"best\") in Afrikaans is still inflected as ''beste'', as in Dutch, hence ''beste man ooit'' (''best man ever'') is correct in both languages.\n\nAt the end of words, Dutch clusters {{angbr|cht}} and {{angbr|st}} were reduced in Afrikaans to {{angbr|g}} and {{angbr|s}} respectively, with ''lucht'' (\"air\", pronounced {{IPA|[l\u028fxt]}}) and ''dienst'' (service, pronounced {{IPA|[dinst]}}) in Dutch becoming ''lug'' ({{IPA|[l\u0259\u03c7]}}) and ''diens'' ({{IPA|[dins]}}) in Afrikaans. Between two vowels, {{angbr|cht}} is replaced with {{angbr|gg}}; compare Dutch ''echtgenoot'' (\"husband\") with Afrikaans ''eggenoot''.\n\nSimilarly, whereas Dutch words like ''technologie'' (\"technology\") and ''monarchie'' contain {{angbr|ch}} (in this case pronounced as {{IPA|[\u03c7]}}) their Afrikaans equivalents use {{angbr|g}}, hence ''tegnologie'' and ''monargie''. In other cases, {{angbr|ch}} is replaced with {{angbr|gg}}, compare ''Tsjechische Republiek'' (\"Czech Republic\") in Dutch with ''Tsjeggiese Republiek'' in Afrikaans.\n\nAt the end of words, Dutch cluster {{angbr|ct}} was reduced to {{angbr|k}} in Afrikaans, hence Dutch ''contact'' and ''perfect'' with Afrikaans ''kontak'' and ''perfek''. Similarly, {{angbr|ctie}} in Dutch (pronounced {{IPA|[ktsi]}}) is replaced by {{angbr|ksie}} (pronounced {{IPA|[ksi]}}); compare ''reactie'' (\"reaction\") and ''connectie'' (\"connection\") in Dutch with ''reaksie'' and ''konneksie'' in Afrikaans.\n\n====Consonant mergers====\nAs a result of Afrikaans merging Dutch consonants {{angbr|z}} and {{angbr|s}} to a single sound {{IPA|[s]}}, spelt {{angbr|s}}, the use of {{angbr|z}} in Afrikaans is confined to words of non-Dutch origin, such as ''Zoeloe'' (\"Zulu\") and ''zero'', or country names like ''Zambi\u00eb'' (\"Zambia\"), while use of {{angbr|z}} is preserved only in Dutch place names in South Africa like [[Zonnebloem]] and [[Zeerust]].\n\nHowever, although ''Suid-Afrika'' (\"South Africa\") is used in Afrikaans rather than ''Zuid-Afrika'' as in Dutch, South Africa adopted \"ZA\" as its [[List of international vehicle registration codes|international vehicle registration code]] in 1936, which later became the country's [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2#ZA|ISO country code]], with [[.za]] becoming the country's [[country code top-level domain|internet domain]].\n\nIn the middle of words, Afrikaans merged Dutch {{angbr|v}} and {{angbr|w}} to a single sound {{IPA|[v]}} and consequently to a single spelling, {{angbr|w}}. Compare Dutch ''haven'' (port) with Afrikaans ''hawe'', both pronounced {{IPA|[\u0266a\u02d0v\u0259]}}. Meanwhile, at the beginning of words, {{angbr|v}} became devoiced to {{IPA|/f/}} in Afrikaans (except in words of Latin origin, like ''visueel'').\n\nAfrikaans merged Dutch fricatives {{angbr|ch}} and {{angbr|g}} to a single sound {{IPA|[\u03c7]}}, spelt {{angbr|g}}, except when preceded by {{angbr|s}}, in which case {{angbr|sk}} (pronounced as spelt) is used where Dutch uses {{angbr|sch}} (pronounced {{IPA|[sx]}}, {{IPA|[s\u03c7]}} or {{IPA|[s\u00e7]}}; hence \"school\" is ''school'' in Dutch but ''skool'' in Afrikaans, but Dutch ''misschien'' (\"maybe\") is written with {{angbr|ss}}, while Afrikaans ''miskien'' is written with {{angbr|s}}.\n\n====Consonant omissions====\nBetween two vowels, the Dutch {{angbr|g}} is omitted in Afrikaans; hence Dutch uses ''hoger'' (\"higher\"), pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0266o\u02d0\u0263\u0259r]}} and ''\"regen\"'' (\"rain\"), pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8re\u02d0.\u0263\u0259(n)]}} while Afrikaans uses ''ho\u00ebr'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u0266u\u0259\u032fr]}}) and ''re\u00ebn'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8r\u026a\u0259\u032fn]}}), in which the second vowel requires a [[umlaut (diacritic)|trema]] to avoid confusion with the digraphs {{angbr|oe}} ({{IPA|[u(\u02d0)]}}) and {{angbr|ee}} ({{IPA|[\u026a\u0259]}}).\n\nThis also applies to Afrikaans nouns that, while ending in {{angbr|g}} as in Dutch, end with {{angbr|e\u00eb}} in the plural; while \"railway\" in both languages is ''spoorweg'', \"railways\" is ''spoorwegen'' in Dutch ({{IPA|[spo\u02d0r\u028be\u02d0\u0263\u0259(n)]}}) but ''spoorwe\u00eb'' ({{IPA|[sp\u028a\u0259rv\u026a\u0259\u032f]}}) in Afrikaans.\n\nBetween two vowels, Dutch {{angbr|v}} is omitted in Afrikaans; compare Dutch  ''avond'' (\"evening\"), pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u02d0.v\u0254nt]}} and ''over'' (\"over\"), pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8o\u02d0v\u0259r]}}, with Afrikaans ''aand'' ({{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0nt]}}) and ''oor'' ({{IPA|[\u028a\u0259r]}}), with {{angbr|aa}} and {{angbr|oo}} being {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[\u028a\u0259]}} respectively. In Afrikaans, as in Dutch, ''oor'' also means \"ear\".\n\nWhere {{angbr|ov}} precedes final {{angbr|en}} in Dutch, as in ''boven'' (\"above\") pronounced {{IPA|[bo\u02d0v\u0259n]}} and ''geloven'' (\"believe\") pronounced {{IPA|[\u0263\u0259\u02c8lo\u02d0v\u0259(n)]}}, in Afrikaans they merge to form the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[\u028a\u0259]}}, resulting in ''bo'' ({{IPA|[b\u028a\u0259]}}) and ''glo'' ({{IPA|[\u03c7l\u028a\u0259]}}). Similarly, ''open'' and ''samen'' (\"together\") in Dutch become ''oop'' ({{IPA|[\u028a\u0259p]}}), and ''saam'' ({{IPA|[s\u0251\u02d0m]}}) in Afrikaans.\n\nAt the end of words, Dutch {{angbr|g}} is sometimes omitted in Afrikaans, which opens up the preceding vowel (usually a short ''{{angbr|e}}'') now written with a [[circumflex]]. For example, the Dutch verb form ''zeg'' (\"say\", pronounced {{IPA|[z\u025bx]}}) became ''s\u00ea'' ({{IPA|[s\u025b\u02d0]}}) in Afrikaans, as did the infinitive ''zeggen'', pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8z\u025b\u0263\u0259(n)]}}. Another example is the Dutch ''leggen'' (\"to lay\", pronounced {{IPA|[l\u025b\u0263\u0259(n)]}}), which becomes ''l\u00ea'' ({{IPA|[l\u025b\u02d0]}}) in Afrikaans.\n\nAlternatively, Dutch verb form ''vraag'' (\"ask\", pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8vra\u02d0\u0263]}}) became ''vra'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8fr\u0251\u02d0]}}) in Afrikaans, which is also the equivalent of the Dutch verb ''vragen'', \"to ask\". Unlike Dutch, ''vraag'' in Afrikaans, pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8fr\u0251\u02d0\u03c7]}}, is only used as a noun meaning \"question\", with ''vrae'', pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8fr\u0251\u02d0\u0259]}}, being the plural form.\n\nThe word for \"day\" in both languages is ''dag'', but whereas the plural in Dutch is ''dagen'' ({{IPA|[da\u02d0\u0263\u0259(n)]}}), in Afrikaans it is ''dae'' ({{IPA|[d\u0251\u02d0\u0259]}}). By contrast, ''wagen'' or \"wagon\" in Dutch, pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8\u028ba\u02d0\u0263\u0259(n)]}}, became ''wa'' in Afrikaans, ({{IPA|[\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0]}}), with the plural form, ''wagens'', pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8\u028ba\u02d0\u0263\u0259ns]}}, became ''wa\u00ebns'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0\u0259ns]}}).\n\n====Circumflex==== \nIn contrast to Dutch, where the use of the [[circumflex]] is essentially limited to French borrowings, like ''enqu\u00eate'', Afrikaans makes frequent use of {{angbr|\u00ea}}, {{angbr|\u00f4}}, and {{angbr|\u00fb}}; examples include ''n\u00earens'' (\"nowhere\", Dutch ''nergens''), ''m\u00f4re'' (\"morning\", Dutch ''morgen''), and ''br\u00fbe'' (\"bridges\", Dutch ''bruggen'').\n\nAs a result of the disappearance of consonants found in equivalent Dutch words, particularly {{angbr|g}}, Afrikaans uses circumflexes with single vowel letters in open syllables to indicate the long monophthongal pronunciations {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}}, {{IPA|[\u0254\u02d0]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0153\u02d0]}}, as opposed to the vowel letters without a circumflex, pronounced as {{IPA|[\u026a\u0259]}}, {{IPA|[\u028a\u0259]}} and {{IPA|[y\u02d0]}}, respectively.\n\nThe circumflex is also used in {{angbr|\u00ee}}, appearing only in ''w\u00eee'' (\"wedges\", Dutch ''wiggen''), where it denotes a long pronunciation {{IPA|[\u0259\u02d0]}}, keeping the digraph {{angbr|ie}} from being pronounced {{IPA|i}}.\n\n====Diminutive====\nIn [[diminutive form]]s, Afrikaans uses {{angbr|tjie}} and {{angbr|etjie}} (normally pronounced {{IPA|[ki]}} and {{IPA|[\u0259ki]}}) where Standard Dutch would use {{angbr|tje}} (pronounced {{IPA|[c\u0259]}} or {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0283\u0259]}}). For example, whereas the diminutive of ''beet'' (\"bit\") in Dutch would be ''beetje''  (pronounced [be\u02d0t\u0361\u0283\u0259]), in Afrikaans, the diminutive of ''biet'' would be ''bietjie'' (pronounced [bi\u02d0ki]).\n\nIn [[Belgium]] and the [[Southern Netherlands]], the diminutive is often realised as {{IPA|[(s)k\u0259]}} in the spoken language. This ending is also found in some varieties of [[Dutch Low Saxon]], a group of dialects spoken in the Northeastern Netherlands. Conversely, in the [[Western Cape]], it is common to hear it realised as {{IPA|[tji]}}. The diminutive of words ending in {{angbr|k}} in Afrikaans is {{angbr|ie}}, hence whereas ''doek'' in Dutch becomes ''doekje'', in Afrikaans, it becomes ''doekie''.\n\nWhere Dutch would use {{angbr|je}}, {{angbr|pje}} and {{angbr|mpje}} (pronounced {{IPA|[j\u0259]}}, {{IPA|[pj\u0259]}} and {{IPA|[mpj\u0259]}}) Afrikaans would use   {{angbr|ie}}, {{angbr|pie}} and {{angbr|mpie}} (pronounced {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[pi]}} and {{IPA|[mpi]}}) hence the diminutives of ''glas'', ''kop'' and ''probleem'' in Dutch would become ''glaasje'', ''kopje'' and ''probleempje'', while in Afrikaans they would be ''glasie'', ''koppie'' and ''probleempie'', with an extra {{angbr|p}} being added to ''kop''. The {{angbr|ie(n)}} ending is also found in some varieties of Dutch Low Saxon: ''glassie(n)'', ''koppie(n)'', ''probleempie(n)''. In addition, the {{angbr|ie}} diminutive is used in Hollands dialects such as that of [[Amsterdam]] as well as in less formal registers of general Dutch. \"A cute little face\", for instance, can be rendered as ''Een schattig koppie''.\n\nOther words formed from diminutives in Dutch ending in {{angbr|tje}} may have different equivalents in Afrikaans; for example, the Dutch term of endearment  ''schatje'' (the diminutive of ''schat'' or \"sweetheart\", literally \"treasure\") is ''skattie'', of which ''skatjie'' is used either as the diminutive or to mean \"little treasure\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&lpg=PA93&ots=PfjIg7lSk9&dq=skattie%20afrikaans&pg=PA93#v=onepage&q=skattie%20afrikaans&f=true ''A Grammar of Afrikaans''], Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, pages 89-93</ref>\n\nIn both languages, the word for \"niece\" is a diminutive of the word for \"female cousin\", but owing to the simplification of consonant clusters in Afrikaans, ''nig'' becomes ''niggie'', using {{angbr|gie}}  in contrast to Dutch, in which ''nicht'' becomes ''nichtje''. The adjectives ''saggies'' and ''zachtjes'', both meaning \"softly\", are diminutives of Afrikaans ''sag'' and Dutch ''zacht'' respectively.\n\n=== Other spelling differences ===\n\nUnlike Dutch, the names of months in Afrikaans are capitalised, hence 2 June 2016 would be written as ''2 Junie 2016'',<ref>[https://www.mysubs.co.za/magazine/product/890401 Huisgenoot | 2 Junie 2016]</ref> whereas in Dutch, it would be written as ''2 juni 2016''.<ref>[http://digitaleeditie.nrc.nl/losseverkoop/NN/2016/5/20160602___/1_01/ nrc.next van donderdag 2 juni 2016]</ref>\n\n== Phonetic differences ==\n\nAfrikaans pronunciation tends to be closest to the dialects of the province of [[South Holland]], in particular that of [[Zoetermeer]].<ref name=\"heeringa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/~heeringa/dialectology/papers/prasa08.pdf |title=The origin of Afrikaans pronunciation: a comparison to west Germanic languages and Dutch dialects |author=Wilbert Heeringa, Febe de Wet |pages=445\u2013467 |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Groningen]] |accessdate=2010-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011940/http://www.let.rug.nl/~heeringa/dialectology/papers/prasa08.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><!--see page 3-->\n\n===Consonant mergers===\nAfrikaans merged Dutch consonants {{angbr|z}} and {{angbr|s}} to a single sound {{IPA|[s]}}, spelt {{angbr|s}}, with ''zorg'' (\"care\") and ''zout'' (\"salt\") in Dutch becoming ''sorg'' and ''sout'' in Afrikaans. A similar phonetic evolution can be found in the Northern Netherlands.\n\nAt the start of words, Afrikaans often merged Dutch voiced {{IPA|[v]}} with voiceless {{IPA|[f]}}, as in ''ver'' (\"far\"), pronounced {{IPA|[f\u025br]}} in Afrikaans and {{IPA|[v\u025br]}} in Standard Dutch. The same merger is present though in the areas around Amsterdam, where all voiced consonants merged with the voiceless ones, pronounced as the latter ones.\n\nAfrikaans merged Dutch voiced {{IPA|[w]}} with voiced {{IPA|[v]}}, as in ''werk'' (\"work\"), pronounced {{IPA|[v\u025brk]}} in Afrikaans and {{IPA|[w\u025brk]}} in Belgium and Suriname or {{IPA|[\u028b\u025brk]}} in the Netherlands. A similar near-assimilation of {{angbr|w}} to {{angbr|v}} can also be found in the Northern Netherlands, where {{angbr|w}} is pronounced {{IPA|[\u028b]}}, and {{angbr|v}} {{IPA|[v]}}.\n<!-- Afrikaans merged /v/ and /f/ as [f], whereafter [w]/[\u028b] became [v].

(\"be strong!\") while ''wezen'' is used as a less formal form of to be than ''zijn''.\n\n=== Verb conjugations ===\nIn Afrikaans verbs, the same form is generally used for both the infinitive and the present tense, with the exception of ''wees'' (\"to be\") conjugated as ''is'' and ''h\u00ea'' (\"to have\") conjugated as ''het'', and there is no inflection for person; contrast ''ek gaan'' (\"I go\") with ''ik ga'', ''hy doen'' (\"he does\") with ''hij doet'', and ''julle was'' (\"you (plural) were\") with ''jullie waren''.\n\nThe [[past participle]] is usually regularly formed by adding the prefix ''ge-'' to the verb, hence ''gedoen'' (\"done\") is formed from ''doen'' in Afrikaans, although Dutch ''gedaan'' survives in Afrikaans as ''welgedaan!'' (\"well done!\") One exception is the verb ''h\u00ea'' (\"to have\") of which the past participle is ''gehad'', while sometimes an irregular past participle is used with the verb ''dink'' (\"to think\") hence  ''hy het gedag'' or ''hy het gedog'', similar to Dutch ''hij heeft gedacht'', instead of ''hy het gedink''.<ref name=\"Donaldsonp223\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&lpg=PA223&dq=%22gedog%22%20%22Afrikaans%22&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q=%22gedink%22&f=false ''A Grammar of Afrikaans''], Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, page 223</ref>\n\nAll other verbs use the existing form as the past participle. For example, \"to pay\" is ''betaal'' and \"I have paid\" is \"ek het betaal\", while \"to translate\" is \"vertaal\" and \"he has translated\" is ''hy het vertaal''; Dutch would use ''betaald'' (from ''betalen'') and ''vertaald'' (from ''vertalen'') respectively.\n\n=== Verb tenses ===\n<!-- only \"had\" and \"mog\" are rarely used, and there are seven which aren't -->\nAfrikaans has dropped the simple past tense for all but a few verbs, of which five are [[modal verb|modals]], hence kon (\"could\") from ''kan'' or \"can\" and ''moes'' or \"should\" from ''moet'' or \"must\"; instead, it generally uses either the present perfect or the present tense, depending on context, the latter being used as the [[historical present]]. It has also lost the pluperfect, conjugated using ''had'', no longer used,<ref name=\"Donaldson258\" /> with the present perfect, conjugated with ''het'', being used instead.<ref name=\"Auwera\" />\n\nConsequently, the sentence ''ek het die boek vir haar gegee'' in Afrikaans can be translated into Dutch as ''ik heb het boek aan haar gegeven'' (\"I have given the book to her\") ''ik gaf het boek aan haar'' (\"I gave the book to her\") or ''ik had het boek aan haar gegeven'' (\"I had given the book to her\").\n\nHowever, the verb ''dink'' (\"to think\") still makes use of a simple past tense; for example, instead of ''ek het gedink'' to mean \"I thought\", ''ek dag'' or ''ek dog'', similar to Dutch ''ik dacht'', is sometimes used instead.<ref name=\"Donaldsonp223\" />\n\nWhereas Dutch distinguishes between verbs that use ''zijn'' (\"to be\") and verbs that use ''hebben'' (\"to have\") in the present perfect, Afrikaans has dropped this distinction, instead using ''h\u00ea'' (\"to have\"), hence \"he has been\" is ''hy '''het al''' gewees'' in Afrikaans, while ''hij '''is''' geweest'' would be used in Dutch. In [[Dutch Low Saxon]], ''hebben'' is found in the present perfect as well: ''hi'j '''hef''' (e)west''.\n\nThe past tense of the passive voice in Afrikaans uses ''is'', the present tense of ''wees'' instead of ''word'', hence ''dit '''word''' geskryf'' (\"it is written\") becomes ''dit '''is''' geskryf'' (\"it was/has been written\").<ref name=\"Donaldson258\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&lpg=PA236&dq=auxiliary%20is%20afrikaans&pg=PA257#v=snippet&q=passive&f=true ''A Grammar of Afrikaans''], Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, pages 257-258</ref> In Dutch, the passive voice can be constructed by both ''zijn'' and ''worden'', hence ''het is/wordt geschreven'', and ''het was/werd geschreven''.\n\nDutch, like English, has a continuous tense using the verb ''zijn'' (\"to be\") with ''aan het'' (\"on the\") and the infinitive, hence \"I am reading\" is ''ik ben aan het lezen'', which may be expressed periphrastically in Afrikaans as ''ek is besig om te lees'' (literally \"I am busy of to read\") or \"I am busy reading\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IZVqidxVsLwC&lpg=PA110&dq=continuous%20tense%20in%20afrikaans&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Focus on South Africa''], Vivian De Klerk, John Benjamins Publishing, 1996, page 110</ref> However, a similar grammatical construction may be found in Afrikaans using ''wees'' (\"to be\") and ''aan die'' (\"on the\") as in ''ek is aan die werk'' (\"I am working\"), though this is less common than ''ek werk'' (\"I work\"/\"I am working\").<ref name=\"Auwera\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rp0hYcAjlIoC&lpg=PA496&dq=%22is%20aan%20die%20werk%22&pg=PA496#v=onepage&q=%22is%20aan%20die%20werk%22&f=false ''The Germanic Languages''], Johan van der Auwera, Ekkehard K\u00f6nig, Taylor & Francis, 1994, pages 496-497</ref>\n\n===Omitting of subordinate conjunctions===\n\nIn Afrikaans, as in English, it is possible to omit the [[subordinate conjunction]] ''dat'' (\"that\"); for example, the phrase \"I believe [that] she has done it\" can be translated into Afrikaans as either ''ek glo dat sy dit gedoen het'' or ''ek glo sy het dit gedoen'' (note the change in position of the auxiliary verb ''het''), but in Dutch it is not possible to do so, hence the sentence would be translated as ''ik geloof '''dat''' ze het gedaan heeft''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DVBdAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA499&dq=afrikaans%20grammar%20subordinate%20clause%20dat&pg=PA499#v=onepage&q&f=true ''The Germanic Languages''], Ekkehard Konig, Johan van der Auwera, Routledge, December 2013, page 499</ref>\n\n===Merger of marked and unmarked forms of words===\nWhereas Dutch has unmarked and marked forms for pronouns, adverbs and indicatives, Afrikaans uses only one form; for example, whereas Dutch uses ''er'' to mean \"here\" or \"there\", Afrikaans only uses ''hier'' for \"here\" and ''daar'' for \"there\", as well as ''hiervan'' (\"hereof\") for \"of this/these\" and ''daarvan''  (\"thereof\") for \"of that/those/them\" , not ''ervan'' as in Dutch.\n\nPronouns in Afrikaans, whether [[Subject pronoun|subjects]], [[Object pronoun|objects]] or [[Possessive pronoun|possessives]], usually have only one form, derived from the Dutch marked forms; compare ''my'' in Afrikaans, which can be used either as the object \"me\" or the possessive \"my\", with Dutch marked forms ''mij'' and ''mijn'', the unmarked forms being ''me'' for \"me\" and ''m'n'' for \"my\" respectively. Whereas Dutch uses the term ''van mij, van jou, van hem, van haar, van ons, van hullie''. to mean \"mine\", \"yours\", \"his\", \"her\", \"ours\" and \"theirs\" respectively, Afrikaans uses ''myne, joune, syne, haar sunne, ons sunne'', and ''hulle sunne''.\n\nDutch uses an apostrophe in some unmarked possessive pronouns instead of the digraph {{angbr|[[IJ (digraph)|ij]]}}, hence ''zijn'' \"his\" or \"its\" becomes ''z'n'', whereas in Afrikaans, ''sy'' is not abbreviated. In Afrikaans ''sy'' also means \"she\", but Dutch equivalents ''ze'' (unmarked) and ''zij'' (marked)  mean either \"she\" as in ''ze/zij is'' (\"she is\"), or \"they\", as in ''ze/zij zijn'' (\"they are\").\n\nSimilarly, Afrikaans uses only ''jy'' as the subject \"you\" (singular) where Dutch uses ''je'' or ''jij'', ''jou'' as the object \"you\" where Dutch uses ''je'' or ''jou'', and as the possessive \"your\" where Dutch would use ''jou'' or ''jouw''.\n\n===Personal pronouns===\n\nAfrikaans, unlike Dutch, has no unmarked or marked forms of pronouns; whereas Dutch distinguishes between ''je/jij'' and ''ze/zij'' for \"you\" (singular) and \"she\" as subject pronouns, Afrikaans uses only ''jy'' and ''sy'', while whereas ''me/mij'' and ''je/jou'' are the Dutch unmarked or marked forms of object pronouns for  \"me\" and \"you\", Afrikaans only uses ''my'' and ''jou''.\n\nIt also lacks the distinction between the [[subject pronoun|subject]] and [[object pronoun|object]] form for plural [[personal pronouns]]; the [[first person plural]] pronoun in Afrikaans differs markedly from Dutch, with ''ons'' meaning either \"we\" or \"us\", in contrast to Dutch ''we'' and ''wij'', hence \"we go to the beach\" is ''ons gaan na die strand'' as opposed to ''we gaan naar het strand''.\n\nSimilarly, the [[third person plural]] pronoun in Afrikaans is ''hulle'', used to mean \"they\" or \"them\", in contrast to Dutch in which ''ze'' and ''zij'' are used as plural pronouns, hence \"they are the best\" is ''hulle is die beste'' as opposed to ''ze zijn de beste'', although ''hullie'' is encountered in Dutch dialects, particularly in [[North Brabant]] and [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=28HkERPkipMC&pg=PA223&lpg=PA223&dq=hullie+nederlands+niet+correct&source=bl&ots=_q7bT0lQg5&sig=g8ARJ9ODCCQ4i4kQrlhH_wunXOA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjt7TmrovQAhXFAsAKHcWOCmIQ6AEIqAEwEg#v=onepage&q=hullie%20nederlands%20niet%20correct&f=false ''Taalkunde voor de tweede fase van het vwo''], Hans Hulshof, Maaike Rietmeijer, Arie Verhagen, Amsterdam University Press, 2006, page 223</ref>\n\nOther possessive pronouns like ''ons'' (\"our\", inflected as ''onze'' in Dutch and ''onse'' in Afrikaans) and Dutch ''jullie'' (\"your\" plural, ''julle'' in Afrikaans) work in a similar fashion in both languages.\n\n===Demonstrative pronouns===\n\nThe word ''die'' is used in Afrikaans as a definite article, but in Dutch, it is used as a [[demonstrative pronoun]] meaning \"that\" or \"those\", or as a relative pronoun meaning \"who\", \"which\" or \"that\", for which Afrikaans would use ''wat''; compare Afrikaans ''die man wat weet'' (\"the man who knows\") with Dutch ''de man die weet''.\n\nFor demonstratives, Afrikaans uses ''hierdie'' for \"this\" or \"these\" and ''daardie'' for \"that\" or \"those\", which are shortened to ''di\u00e9'' (with an acute accent) and ''daai''.<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Ontspan/Gesondheid/dink-2-keer-oor-daai-glas-wyn-20161016 Dink 2 keer oor daai glas wyn], [[News 24 (South Africa)|News24]], 16 October 2016</ref> In Dutch, ''dit'' is used as the word for \"this\", whereas in Afrikaans it is the third-person singular impersonal pronoun meaning \"it\", with ''dis'' being a contraction of ''dit is'', similar to \"it's\" in English.\n\n=== Genitive ===\n\nAs Afrikaans has no genitive forms of nouns, the official titles of most countries include the word ''van'', although this was considered optional, hence ''Republiek '''van''' Malta'' (as opposed to ''Republiek  Malta'' as in Dutch) although ''Republiek van Suid-Afrika'' was previously considered an anglicism.<ref name=\"Donaldson93\" /> However, the [[Union of South Africa]] was known in Dutch and Afrikaans as ''Unie van Zuid-Afrika'' and ''Unie van Suid-Afrika'' respectively.<ref name=\"wetten\" />\n\nThe title \"Kingdom of the Netherlands\", which refers to the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|entire realm]] including its [[Dutch Caribbean|Caribbean islands]], is known in Afrikaans as ''Koninkryk van die Nederlande'', a direct translation of the Dutch title ''Koninkrijk der Nederlanden'', which uses the genitive article ''der'' meaning \"of the\".<ref name=\"wetten\">[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBV0005957/geldigheidsdatum_27-06-2013 Notawisseling tussen de Nederlandse en de Zuid-Afrikaanse Regering houdende een overeenkomst &#91;...&#93; het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Unie van Zuid-Afrika, Kaapstad, 20-02-1935], wetten.overheid.nl, 20 February 1935</ref>\n\nAfrikaans may form [[Compound (linguistics)#Germanic languages|compounds]] where Dutch would use separate words using the genitive or equivalent, or vice versa.

(\"is that your glass or his?\") in contrast to ''is dat jouw glas of '''het''' zijne?'' in Dutch.\n\nSimilarly, ''van'' or \"of\" is also omitted in Afrikaans; compare ''dit is my fiets, waar is joune?'' (\"that is my bike, where is yours?\") to Dutch ''dat is mijn fiets, waar is die van jou?'' However, Dutch also uses the construction ''waar is de jouwe?''\n\n=== Plural ===\n\nWhile Afrikaans uses ''-e'' as the plural of most nouns, similar to Dutch ''-en'', it also uses the ''-s''  ending where Dutch would use ''-en'', hence the plural of ''seun'' (\"son\") being ''seuns'', in contrast to Dutch, in which the plural of ''zoon'' is ''zonen'', ''zoons'' being used as a plural in eighteenth century Dutch.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hWtKAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22zoons%22&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q=%22zoons%22&f=false ''Nieuwe Nederlandsche jaerboeken''], 1784, page 9</ref>\n\nSimilarly, ''-ers'' is used as a [[double plural]] instead of ''-eren'', hence the plural of ''kind'' (\"child\") is ''kinders'', not ''kinderen'', although the plural ''kinders'' being used in nineteenth century forms of Dutch,<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UCXKKvxyPagC&dq=%22kinders%22&pg=PA267#v=onepage&q=%22kinders%22&f=false ''De Fransche taal gemakkelyk gemaakt, of duidelyke en korte manier om het Fransch te leeren en te onderwyzen''], Johan Rudolph Wurstysen, St.-Jacobs-straat, No. 753, 1806, page 267</ref> including [[West Flemish]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fp-eP8-JVfMC&dq=%22kinders%22&pg=PA148#v=onepage&q=%22kinders%22&f=false ''Annales de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Emulation de Bruges''], Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Emulation pour l'Histoire et les Antiquit\u00e9s de la Flandre Occidentale, 1866, page 148</ref>\n\n=== Double negative === \nA notable feature of Afrikaans is its use of a [[double negative]], which is absent in standard Dutch (yet still exists in some dialects like [[West Flemish]]).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7ec2TKXlEAC |title=Negative sentences in the languages of Europe: a typological approach. |accessdate=2010-05-19 |first1=Giuliano |last1=Bernini |first2=Paolo |last2=Ramat |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |year=2007}}</ref> For example, Dutch ''Ik spreek '''geen''' Engels'' (I do not speak English) in Afrikaans becomes ''Ek praat '''nie''' Engels '''nie'''.''

Unlike Dutch, this inflection depends only on position, not grammatical gender; for example, ''nasionaal'', when followed by ''party'' becomes ''nasionale'', hence ''Nasionale Party''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bHAdAQAAMAAJ&q=Nasionale+Party&dq=Nasionale+Party&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLmN72i5DQAhViOMAKHVGECjoQ6AEIMTAD ''Die Nasionale Party: die eerste bewindsjare 1924-1934''], J.

(\"pets, like cats and dogs,...\") could be translated into Dutch either as ''huisdieren '''als''' katten en honden''  or ''dieren '''zoals''' katten en honden...''.<ref>[http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1336/als_zoals/ Als / zoals], [[Taalunie]]</ref>\n\nWhile the Afrikaans verb ''heet'' can be used to mean \"to be called\",<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMM3R6giBDwC&lpg=PA413&dq=hy%20praat%20hollands%20afrikaans&pg=PA380#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Afrikaans for All''], Jan Nieuwoudt Tromp, Dent, 1952, page 41</ref> like the Dutch ''heten'', it is less commonly used for that purpose, hence \"what is your name?\" and \"my name is John\" would be ''wat is jou naam?'' and ''my naam is Johan'', rather than ''hoe heet jy?'' (\"how are you called?\") and ''ek heet Johan''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMM3R6giBDwC&lpg=PA413&dq=hy%20praat%20hollands%20afrikaans&pg=PA380#v=onepage&q&f=true ''A Grammar of Afrikaans''], Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, page 324</ref> By contrast, Dutch would use ''hoe heet je?'' and ''ik heet John''.\n\nIn Afrikaans, ''heet'' is used to mean \"to be said\", for example, ''soos dit heet'' (\"as it is claimed\") or, as in Dutch, \"to bid\", as in ''ek heet jou welkom'' (\"I bid you welcome\" or \"I welcome you\"). As an adjective, like the Dutch ''heet'', it means \"hot\", as in \"high temperature\", and can also mean \"fiery temper\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMM3R6giBDwC&lpg=PA413&dq=hy%20praat%20hollands%20afrikaans&pg=PA380#v=onepage&q=heet&f=true ''HAT: verklarende handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse taal''], edited by F.

E. Osselton, R. Hempelman\nRoutledge, 2003, page 158</ref>\n\nLike ''praten'' in Dutch, the verb ''praat'' in Afrikaans means \"to talk\", but can also mean \"to speak\", where Dutch uses ''spreken''; compare ''sy praat vlot Engels'' (\"she speaks English fluently\") with ''zij spreekt vlot Engels''. However, Afrikaans uses ''sprekend'' as an adjective meaning \"speaking\", as in ''Afrikaansprekend'' (\"Afrikaans-speaking\"). ''Spreek'' is used interchangeably with ''praat'', but ''praat'' is more common.\n\nLike \"football\" in [[American English|American]] and [[Australian English]], the term ''voetbal'' is not generally used in Afrikaans to mean [[soccer]], which, unlike in Dutch, is called ''sokker''.<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Sport/Sokker/euro2016-meer-as-sokker-op-die-spel-vir-frankryk-20160610 Euro 2016: Meer as sokker op die spel vir Frankryk], ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 10 June 2016</ref> Instead, it is used in the context of other [[Code of football|codes of football]], such as [[American football]], hence ''Amerikaanse voetbal''.<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Sport/Keniaan-verruil-Kings-vir-Amerikaanse-voetbal-20130726 Keniaan 'verruil Kings vir Amerikaanse voetbal'], [[News 24 (South Africa)|Netwerk 24]], 26 July 2013</ref> In Dutch, ''soccer'' is only used to refer to the game when played in the [[United States]].<ref>[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/07/04/soccer-is-leuk-en-lucratief-ontdekken-ook-de-amerikanen-a1501049 Soccer is leuk \u00e9n lucratief, ontdekken ook de Amerikanen], ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 4 July 2014</ref> [[Rugby football|Rugby]], however, is the more popular sport amongst [[Afrikaners]].<ref>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/football-or-rugby-whose-players-are-tougher-83608687/\n</ref>\n\n===Changes due to spelling and pronunciation===\nThe changes in spelling and pronunciation in Afrikaans means that two unrelated words become [[homophone]]s and are written identically, unlike their Dutch equivalents; ''bly'' in Afrikaans, like ''blij'' in Dutch is used as an adjective to mean \"happy\", it is also a verb meaning \"to remain\", cognate with ''blijven'' in Dutch.\n\nIn Afrikaans, unlike Dutch, the word ''n\u00e1'' (meaning \"after\") is written with an [[acute accent]], as ''na'' (derived from Dutch ''naar'') means \"to\". Conversely, while the Dutch word for \"one\" is written as ''\u00e9\u00e9n'', to distinguish it from the indefinite article ''een'', in Afrikaans, ''een'' (\"one\") is written without any [[diacritics]] as the indefinite article in that language is ''\u0149''.\n\nSimilarly, the Dutch word for \"before\", ''v\u00f3\u00f3r'', may be written with acute accents on both vowels to distinguish it from ''voor'', meaning \"for\", although it is correct to write the word without them irrespective of meaning.<ref>[http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1217/vr_voor/ V\u00f3\u00f3r / voor], [[Taalunie]]</ref> By contrast, ''voor'' in Afrikaans only means \"before\", the word for \"for\" being ''vir'', and so no diacritics are required.\n\nIn both languages, ''oor'' means \"ear\", but in Afrikaans ''oor'' (derived from Dutch ''over'') can also mean \"over\" or \"about\", as in ''hy praat oor die weer'' (\"he talks about the weather\", or in Dutch ''hij spreekt over het weer'').<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Hy-praat-oor-die-weer-en-meer-20141128 Hy praat oor die weer, en meer], ''Netwerk24'', 28 November 2014</ref> Although Dutch and Afrikaans share a number of words prefixed with {{angbr|oor}}, such as ''oorsprong'' (\"origin\"), this is an unrelated word meaning \"original\".\n\nAlthough ''kus'' in Afrikaans can mean \"kiss\", as in Dutch, the more usual term is ''soen'', similar to Dutch ''zoen'',<ref>[http://www.huisgenoot.com/bekendes/massahisterie-volg-nadat-victoria-beckham-haar-dogtertjie-soen/ Massahisterie volg nadat Victoria Beckham haar dogtertjie soen], ''[[Huisgenoot]]'', 14 July 2016</ref> as the [[homophone]] ''kus'' means \"coast\". In contrast to the Dutch equivalents ''kus'' and ''kust'' (plural ''kussen'' and ''kusten''), it is only in their inflected plural forms ''kusse'' and ''kuste'' that the two Afrikaans words can be clearly distinguished.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMM3R6giBDwC&lpg=PA413&dq=hy%20praat%20hollands%20afrikaans&pg=PA639#v=onepage&q&f=true ''HAT: verklarende handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse taal''], edited by F. F. Odendal, R. H. Gouws, Pearson South Africa, 2005, page 639</ref>\n\n===False friends due to English influence===\nEnglish language influence has also resulted in changes in the meanings of some Afrikaans words, such as ''eventueel'', which now means \"eventual\" or \"eventually\", rather than \"possibly\", as in Dutch.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&lpg=PA207&ots=PfjIcblSk6&dq=eventueel%20afrikaans%20dutch&pg=PA207#v=onepage&q=eventueel%20afrikaans%20dutch&f=true ''A Grammar of Afrikaans''], Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, page 207</ref> Consequently, some Afrikaans dictionaries give both meanings, with the entry for ''eventueel'' listing ''uitendelik'' (\"finally\") as well as ''moontlik'' (\"possible\") as definitions.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0I6CvubZf0gC&lpg=PA182&vq=eventueel&dq=%22skietparty%22&pg=PA166#v=snippet&q=eventueel&f=false ''Makro Blokraaisels Woordeboek''], L.L. Pansegrouw, Pearson South Africa, 1998, page 166</ref> However, the latter is described as ''Nederlandisties'' or \"Dutch-influenced\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMM3R6giBDwC&lpg=PA413&dq=hy%20praat%20hollands%20afrikaans&pg=PA226#v=onepage&q&f=true ''HAT: verklarende handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse taal''], edited by F. F. Odendal, R. H. Gouws, Pearson South Africa, 2005, page 226</ref>\n \nBy contrast, other Afrikaans words cognate with Dutch ones retain the same meaning, such as ''aktueel'', which, like ''actueel'' in Dutch, means \"up to date\" or \"concerned with current affairs\", although ''aktualiteit'' can also mean \"reality\" in the sense of the English word \"actuality\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMM3R6giBDwC&lpg=PA413&dq=hy%20praat%20hollands%20afrikaans&pg=PA39#v=onepage&q=aktueel&f=false ''HAT: verklarende handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse taal''], edited by F. F. Odendal, R. H. Gouws, Pearson South Africa, 2005, page 226</ref> The Dutch word ''actualiteit'', on the other hand, only means \"topicality\" or \"current events\". Dutch also previously spelled both ''actueel'' and ''actualiteit'' with a \"k\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eJlKaUpjInUC&lpg=PA199&dq=aktualiteit&pg=PA199#v=onepage&q=aktualiteit&f=false ''Middeleeuwse wijsbegeerte: traditie en vernieuwing''], Uitgeverij Van Gorcum, 1977, page 198-199</ref>\n\n===Colloquialisms===\nAnother consequence of the two languages diverging has been the differences between colloquialisms, meaning that a word in Dutch which has no offensive connotations is used as an expletive or term of abuse in Afrikaans, and vice versa, although other changes in meanings have also arisen.\n\nFor example, the Afrikaans phrase ''die meisie gooi haar flikkers'' (\"the girl throws her sparkle\") was highlighted by the Dutch journalist, [[Derk-Jan Eppink]], in an article in the daily ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', as an example of differences in meaning.<ref>[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1990/03/27/artikel-ontketent-polemiek-over-afrikaans-maagbom-6926523-a716110 Artikel ontketent polemiek over Afrikaans; Maagbom voorkaaskop], ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 27 March 1990</ref> In Afrikaans, ''flikkers by iemand gooi'' means to [[Flirting|flirt]] with someone,<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=keVT5aIL9fAC&lpg=PA147&ots=lCWP-IxSmG&dq=die%20meisie%20gooi%20haar%20flikkers&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q=die%20meisie%20gooi%20haar%20flikkers&f=true ''HAT: verklarende handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse taal''], edited by F. F. Odendal, R. H. Gouws, Pearson South Africa, 2005, page 147</ref> but in Dutch, ''flikker'' means a male homosexual, while ''flikker op!'' is akin to the [[British English]] expletive \"bugger off!\"<ref>[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/11/01/japke-dflikker-op-met-je-punt-op-de-horizon-5064719-a1529599 Flikker op met je punt op de horizon], ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 1 November 2016</ref>\n\n===List of words with different meanings===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:28%;\"| Word \n!

non-[[cognates]] when listening to Afrikaans than the other way round.<ref name=\"gooskens\" /><!--see page 460-->\n\nFor example, the Afrikaans sentence ''ons is uit die Land van Israel'' (\"we are from the Land of Israel\") would be understood by a Dutch speaker as meaning \"us is from that Land of Israel\", whereas the Dutch equivalent ''we komen uit het Land Isra\u00ebl'' would be less readily understood by an Afrikaans speaker as there are no words cognate with ''we'' or ''het''.\n\nIn Afrikaans, ''het'' is the inflection of the verb ''h\u00ea'' (\"to have\" from Dutch ''hebben'') although ''sy'' (cognate with ''zijn'') is used as the subjunctive of \"to be\", while ''we'' in Dutch is cognate with \"we\" in English, a language widely understood by Afrikaans speakers. Conversely, ''wees'', meaning \"to be\" in Afrikaans, is used as the imperative in Dutch, although it is used as the imperative in religious contexts in Afrikaans (e.g. ''wees genadig'', meaning \"be merciful\" or \"have mercy\").\n\n====Verb forms====\nThe simplification of verbs in Afrikaans, with almost all verbs being regular and the near absence of the simple past tense, means that while the phrase ''ek het gehelp'' (\"I have helped\" or \"I helped\") would be recognisable by Dutch speakers, the Dutch phrases ''ik heb geholpen'' and ''ik hielp'' would not be as readily understood by speakers of Afrikaans.\n\nSimilarly, the resemblance of Afrikaans verbs like ''lees'' (\"to read\", Dutch ''lezen'') to the first person singular and verbs like ''gaan'' (\"to go\") to infinitive forms in Dutch means that ''julle lees'' (\"you [plural] read\") or ''ek gaan'' (\"I go\") would be understood by Dutch speakers more readily than ''jullie lezen'' or ''ik ga'' would be by Afrikaans speakers.\n\n====Unmarked and marked forms of words====\nAs Afrikaans no longer has unmarked and marked forms of words, instead using words derived from the marked forms in Dutch, the Afrikaans words for \"there\" and \"now\", ''daar'' and ''nou'', are more intelligible to speakers of Dutch than the unmarked Dutch forms ''er'' and ''nu''  are to Afrikaans speakers.\n\nFor example, ''nou is daar'', meaning \"now there is\" in Afrikaans,<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Stemme/Menings/tim-du-plessis-nou-is-daar-geen-keuse-meer-nie-20160313 Tim du Plessis: Nou is daar geen keuse meer nie], [[News24|Netwerk 24]], 13 March 2016</ref> is sometimes encountered in Dutch<ref>[http://www.nu.nl/weekend/4019985/pieter-derks-verwerkt-maart-integriteitsakkefietjes.html Het leukste bericht van deze maand kwam van vliegbasis Volkel.], [[NU.nl]], 27 March 2015</ref> although ''nou'' is used more colloquially for emphasis, in the sense of the English \"well\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ilTCY6hePRkC&lpg=PA166&ots=_XGH0rtNmz&dq=nou%20nu%20dutch&pg=PA166#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Dubbel Dutch''], Kevin Cook, Kemper Conseil Publishing, 2002, page 166</ref> In Dutch, \"now there is\" would be translated as ''nu is er'', using the unmarked forms, which do not exist in Afrikaans.<ref>[http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/27085791/___Nu_is_er_helemaal_geen_flow_bij_PSV___.html 'Nu is er helemaal geen flow bij PSV'], ''[[De Telegraaf]]'', 22 November 2016</ref>\n\n===Intelligibility of Dutch to Afrikaans speakers===\n\n====Loanwords vs purisms====\nAfrikaans uses purisms or calques where Dutch would use loans from [[French language|French]], [[Latin]] or [[English language|English]]. Owing to the exposure of Afrikaans speakers to English, Dutch words like ''computer'', ''lift'' and ''appartement'' are more readily understood by them than Afrikaans equivalents like ''rekenaar'', ''hysbak'' and ''woonstel'' are by Dutch speakers.\n\nSimilarly, Dutch words such as ''favoriet'' (\"favourite\"), ''film'', and ''station'' are intelligible to Afrikaans speakers on account of their resemblance to their English equivalents, whereas the Afrikaans ''gunsteling'', ''rolprent'', and ''stasie'' (cognate with Dutch ''statie''), while intelligible to Dutch speakers, would be considered old-fashioned.\n\n====Words of Dutch and non-Dutch origin====\nIn addition, while Afrikaans may use words of non-Dutch origin unintelligible to Dutch speakers (such as those derived from [[Malay language|Malay]] like ''baie'', meaning \"very\" or \"much\", and ''amper'' meaning \"almost\" or \"nearly\"), their Dutch equivalents, or cognates, are also used in Afrikaans, and would therefore be more intelligible to Afrikaans speakers.\n\nFor example, although ''baie'', from ''banyak''<ref name=\"Mesthrie\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aIivedw-oZYC&lpg=PA214&ots=IW0w-cL9xz&dq=baie%20banyak&pg=PA214#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Language and Social History: Studies in South African Sociolinguistics''], Rajend Mesthrie\nNew Africa Books, 1995, page 214</ref> has no cognate in Dutch, ''heel'' as in ''heel goed'' (\"very good\") is used in Afrikaans as well as Dutch.<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Wereld/niks-kan-trump-masjien-nou-stuit-20160504 'Dit gaan 'heel goed' met die ekonoom Dawie Roodt n\u00e1 mesaanval'], [[News 24 (South Africa)|Netwerk24]], 25 July 2015</ref> The word ''amper'' is unrelated to the Dutch word ''amper'' (\"scarcely\" or \"sour\"), being derived from the Malay ''hampir'',<ref name=\"Mesthrie\" /> but the Dutch word ''bijna'', also meaning \"almost\" or \"nearly\",<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uVP1CAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA199&dq=%22bijna%22%20english%20%22almost%22&pg=PA216#v=onepage&q&f=true ''A Contrastive Grammar of English and Dutch / Contrastieve grammatica Engels / Nederlands''], F.

Thieme, 1832, page 90</ref>\n\nOther simplifications in Afrikaans had earlier been proposed for Dutch by R.A Kollewijn, but were either not adopted until 1934, such as changing {{angbr|sch}} to {{angbr|s}} (hence ''Nederlandsch'' to ''Nederlands''), or rejected, such as changing {{angbr|isch}} to {{angbr|ies}} (hence ''logisch'' to ''logies'') and {{angbr|ijk}} to {{angbr|ik}} (hence ''moeilijk'' to ''moeilik'').<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xo2MGkyEfbMC&lpg=PA170&dq=kollewijn%20spelling%20afrikaans&pg=PA170#v=onepage&q=kollewijn%20spelling%20afrikaans&f=true ''Dutch: Biography of a Language''], Roland Willemyns, Oxford University Press USA, page 170</ref>\n\n=== Afrikaans simplifications ===\n\n====Replacement of {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|ch}}====\nAfrikaans uses {{angbr|k}} for the Dutch hard {{angbr|c}}, both pronounced [[International Phonetic Alphabet|[ k ]]]; compare Dutch ''{{wiktnl|cultuur}}'' (\"culture\") with Afrikaans ''{{wiktaf|kultuur}}''.

An example is ''{{wiktnl|prijs}}'' (price), which is spelt ''prys'' in Afrikaans. Dutch words ''ending'' in {{angbr|lijk}}, however, end in {{angbr|lik}} in Afrikaans, not {{angbr|lyk}}, for example ''{{wiktnl|lelijk}}'' (ugly) in Dutch becomes ''{{wiktaf|lelik}}'' in Afrikaans. In both languages, this suffix is pronounced {{IPA|[l\u0259k]}}, with a [[schwa]].\n\nIn Dutch, in which {{angbr|[[IJ (digraph)|ij]]}} is treated as a separate [[Dutch alphabet|letter of the alphabet]], ''IJ'' often features in place names in the Netherlands like [[IJsselmeer]], or in the Dutch name for [[Iceland]], ''IJsland''. Afrikaans similarly uses ''Ysland'',<ref>[http://www.sarie.com/lewe-liefdes/hieroor-praat-mense/besoek-aan-ysland/ My besoek aan Ysland], ''[[Sarie]]'', 12 August 2013</ref> which was also used in 18th century Dutch.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3JpaAAAAcAAJ&lpg=RA1-PP3&ots=b1axfSbbnV&dq=%22Ysland%22&pg=RA1-PP3#v=onepage&q=%22Ysland%22&f=false ''Beschryving van Ysland, Groenland en de Straat Davis''], Johann Anderson, D. J. J., Niels Horrebow, Johann Dietrich Winckler, Jan van Dalen, 1756</ref>\n\nHowever, few place names in South Africa of Dutch origin begin with ''Y'', with the exception of [[Yzerfontein]] in the [[Western Cape]]. The spelling of name of the town, which means ''iron fountain'', is based on the old Dutch word for iron, ''yzer''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jj5EAAAAcAAJ&dq=%22yzer%22&pg=RA4-PA97#v=onepage&q=%22yzer%22&f=true ''Lexicon Hieroglyphicum Sacro-Profanum Of Woordboek Van Gewyde en Ongewyde Voor- En Zinnebeelden''], Martinus Koning, Van Braam, 1717, page 97</ref> It was also previously written as Ijsterfontein.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/recordsofcapecol00thea Records of the Cape Colony],\nGeorge McCall Theal, Clowes, 1837-1919</ref> The modern Afrikaans word for iron is ''yster'', while in Dutch it is ''ijzer''.\t \n  \nIn modern Dutch, {{angbr|y}} is now typically used in words of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin like ''cyclus'' (\"cycle\") replaced by {{angbr|i}} in its Afrikaans equivalent ''siklus'', although both are pronounced as {{IPA|[i]}}. However, unlike the {{angbr|y}} in Dutch ''syndroom'' (\"syndrome\"), the {{angbr|i}} in  Afrikaans ''sindroom'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[\u0259]}}, as is the rule for the short i in Afrikaans in general.\n\n==== Mergers of digraphs or trigraphs ====\nAfrikaans merged Dutch trigraphs {{angbr|tie}}, {{angbr|cie}} and {{angbr|sie}} to a single spelling {{angbr|sie}}. Apart from {{angbr|tie}}, generally pronounced as {{IPA|[tsi]}} in the Netherlands, there is no difference in pronunciation; compare Dutch ''{{wiktnl|provincie}}'' (\"province\") and ''{{wiktnl|politie}}'' (\"police\") with Afrikaans ''{{wiktaf|provinsie}}'' and ''{{wiktaf|polisie}}''. However, words ending in {{angbr|tie}} in Dutch are often pronounced as {{IPA|[si]}} particularly in [[Flanders]].<ref name=\"OT99\">[http://cf.hum.uva.nl/poldernederlands/abn_nederlands/twee_uitspraaknormen.html \u00c9\u00e9n taal, twee uitspraaknormen], ''Onze Taal'', June 1999, pages 148-150</ref>\n\nAfrikaans merged Dutch digraphs and trigraphs {{angbr|ou}}, {{angbr|ouw}}, {{angbr|au}}, and {{angbr|auw}} (pronounced identically as {{IPA|/\u0251\u028a/}} by many Dutch speakers) to a single spelling {{angbr|ou}}, (contrasingly pronounced {{IPA|/\u0153u/}}); ''{{wiktnl|vrouw}}'' (\"woman\") and ''{{wiktnl|dauw}}'' (\"dew\") in Dutch become ''{{wiktaf|vrou}}'' and ''{{wiktaf|dou}}'' in Afrikaans respectively. Similarly, some Dutch words beginning with {{angbr|au}}, such as ''autonomie'' are written with {{angbr|ou}}, hence \n''outonomie''. \n\nThe Dutch cluster {{angbr|tion}} became {{angbr|sion}} in Afrikaans. Compare ''{{wiktnl|nationaal}}'' (\"national\") with ''{{wiktaf|nasionaal}}''. In Dutch, the pronunciation differs from region to region and include {{IPA|[tsi\u0254n]}}, {{IPA|[si\u0254n]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0283on]}}.\n\nConversely, the Afrikaans cluster {{angbr|si}} in words such as ''spesiaal'' (\"special\") and ''pensioen'' (\"pension\") is pronounced as {{IPA|[\u0283i]}} with an extra syllable  {{angbr|i}}, but in Dutch, both the {{angbr|ci}} in ''speciaal'' and {{angbr|si}} in ''pensioen'' are pronounced as {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, although the pronunciation {{IPA|[\u0283j]}} is encountered in the [[Southern Netherlands]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iG-Y04tngq8C&lpg=PA108&ots=_vk0lefOj2&dq=uitspraak%20politie%20vlaanderen&pg=PA108#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Nederlands in het perspectief van uitspraakverwerving en contrastieve taalkunde''], Laurent Rasier, Academia Press, 2011, page 108</ref>\n\n==== Dropping of final letters ====\nAt the end of words, Afrikaans often dropped the {{angbr|n}} in the Dutch cluster {{angbr|en}} (pronounced as a schwa, {{IPA|[\u0259]}}), mainly present in plural nouns and verb forms, to become {{angbr|e}} Compare Dutch ''{{wiktnl|leven}}'' (life) and ''{{wiktnl|mensen}}'' (people) to Afrikaans ''{{wiktaf|lewe}}'' and ''{{wiktaf|mense}}''. Also in Dutch, final -n is often deleted after a schwa, but the occurrence and frequency of this phenomenon varies between speakers, and it is not recognised in spelling.\n\n=== Phonetically induced spelling differences ===\n\n====Simplification of consonant clusters====\nAfrikaans has frequently simplified [[consonant cluster]]s in final position that are still present in Dutch, although they are used in inflected forms of adjectives, for example, ''bes'' (\"best\") in Afrikaans is still inflected as ''beste'', as in Dutch, hence ''beste man ooit'' (''best man ever'') is correct in both languages.\n\nAt the end of words, Dutch clusters {{angbr|cht}} and {{angbr|st}} were reduced in Afrikaans to {{angbr|g}} and {{angbr|s}} respectively, with ''lucht'' (\"air\", pronounced {{IPA|[l\u028fxt]}}) and ''dienst'' (service, pronounced {{IPA|[dinst]}}) in Dutch becoming ''lug'' ({{IPA|[l\u0259\u03c7]}}) and ''diens'' ({{IPA|[dins]}}) in Afrikaans. Between two vowels, {{angbr|cht}} is replaced with {{angbr|gg}}; compare Dutch ''echtgenoot'' (\"husband\") with Afrikaans ''eggenoot''.\n\nSimilarly, whereas Dutch words like ''technologie'' (\"technology\") and ''monarchie'' contain {{angbr|ch}} (in this case pronounced as {{IPA|[\u03c7]}}) their Afrikaans equivalents use {{angbr|g}}, hence ''tegnologie'' and ''monargie''. In other cases, {{angbr|ch}} is replaced with {{angbr|gg}}, compare ''Tsjechische Republiek'' (\"Czech Republic\") in Dutch with ''Tsjeggiese Republiek'' in Afrikaans.\n\nAt the end of words, Dutch cluster {{angbr|ct}} was reduced to {{angbr|k}} in Afrikaans, hence Dutch ''contact'' and ''perfect'' with Afrikaans ''kontak'' and ''perfek''. Similarly, {{angbr|ctie}} in Dutch (pronounced {{IPA|[ktsi]}}) is replaced by {{angbr|ksie}} (pronounced {{IPA|[ksi]}}); compare ''reactie'' (\"reaction\") and ''connectie'' (\"connection\") in Dutch with ''reaksie'' and ''konneksie'' in Afrikaans.\n\n====Consonant mergers====\nAs a result of Afrikaans merging Dutch consonants {{angbr|z}} and {{angbr|s}} to a single sound {{IPA|[s]}}, spelt {{angbr|s}}, the use of {{angbr|z}} in Afrikaans is confined to words of non-Dutch origin, such as ''Zoeloe'' (\"Zulu\") and ''zero'', or country names like ''Zambi\u00eb'' (\"Zambia\"), while use of {{angbr|z}} is preserved only in Dutch place names in South Africa like [[Zonnebloem]] and [[Zeerust]].\n\nHowever, although ''Suid-Afrika'' (\"South Africa\") is used in Afrikaans rather than ''Zuid-Afrika'' as in Dutch, South Africa adopted \"ZA\" as its [[List of international vehicle registration codes|international vehicle registration code]] in 1936, which later became the country's [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2#ZA|ISO country code]], with [[.za]] becoming the country's [[country code top-level domain|internet domain]].\n\nIn the middle of words, Afrikaans merged Dutch {{angbr|v}} and {{angbr|w}} to a single sound {{IPA|[v]}} and consequently to a single spelling, {{angbr|w}}. Compare Dutch ''haven'' (port) with Afrikaans ''hawe'', both pronounced {{IPA|[\u0266a\u02d0v\u0259]}}. Meanwhile, at the beginning of words, {{angbr|v}} became devoiced to {{IPA|/f/}} in Afrikaans (except in words of Latin origin, like ''visueel'').\n\nAfrikaans merged Dutch fricatives {{angbr|ch}} and {{angbr|g}} to a single sound {{IPA|[\u03c7]}}, spelt {{angbr|g}}, except when preceded by {{angbr|s}}, in which case {{angbr|sk}} (pronounced as spelt) is used where Dutch uses {{angbr|sch}} (pronounced {{IPA|[sx]}}, {{IPA|[s\u03c7]}} or {{IPA|[s\u00e7]}}; hence \"school\" is ''school'' in Dutch but ''skool'' in Afrikaans, but Dutch ''misschien'' (\"maybe\") is written with {{angbr|ss}}, while Afrikaans ''miskien'' is written with {{angbr|s}}.\n\n====Consonant omissions====\nBetween two vowels, the Dutch {{angbr|g}} is omitted in Afrikaans; hence Dutch uses ''hoger'' (\"higher\"), pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0266o\u02d0\u0263\u0259r]}} and ''\"regen\"'' (\"rain\"), pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8re\u02d0.\u0263\u0259(n)]}} while Afrikaans uses ''ho\u00ebr'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u0266u\u0259\u032fr]}}) and ''re\u00ebn'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8r\u026a\u0259\u032fn]}}), in which the second vowel requires a [[umlaut (diacritic)|trema]] to avoid confusion with the digraphs {{angbr|oe}} ({{IPA|[u(\u02d0)]}}) and {{angbr|ee}} ({{IPA|[\u026a\u0259]}}).\n\nThis also applies to Afrikaans nouns that, while ending in {{angbr|g}} as in Dutch, end with {{angbr|e\u00eb}} in the plural; while \"railway\" in both languages is ''spoorweg'', \"railways\" is ''spoorwegen'' in Dutch ({{IPA|[spo\u02d0r\u028be\u02d0\u0263\u0259(n)]}}) but ''spoorwe\u00eb'' ({{IPA|[sp\u028a\u0259rv\u026a\u0259\u032f]}}) in Afrikaans.\n\nBetween two vowels, Dutch {{angbr|v}} is omitted in Afrikaans; compare Dutch  ''avond'' (\"evening\"), pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u02d0.v\u0254nt]}} and ''over'' (\"over\"), pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8o\u02d0v\u0259r]}}, with Afrikaans ''aand'' ({{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0nt]}}) and ''oor'' ({{IPA|[\u028a\u0259r]}}), with {{angbr|aa}} and {{angbr|oo}} being {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[\u028a\u0259]}} respectively. In Afrikaans, as in Dutch, ''oor'' also means \"ear\".\n\nWhere {{angbr|ov}} precedes final {{angbr|en}} in Dutch, as in ''boven'' (\"above\") pronounced {{IPA|[bo\u02d0v\u0259n]}} and ''geloven'' (\"believe\") pronounced {{IPA|[\u0263\u0259\u02c8lo\u02d0v\u0259(n)]}}, in Afrikaans they merge to form the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[\u028a\u0259]}}, resulting in ''bo'' ({{IPA|[b\u028a\u0259]}}) and ''glo'' ({{IPA|[\u03c7l\u028a\u0259]}}). Similarly, ''open'' and ''samen'' (\"together\") in Dutch become ''oop'' ({{IPA|[\u028a\u0259p]}}), and ''saam'' ({{IPA|[s\u0251\u02d0m]}}) in Afrikaans.\n\nAt the end of words, Dutch {{angbr|g}} is sometimes omitted in Afrikaans, which opens up the preceding vowel (usually a short ''{{angbr|e}}'') now written with a [[circumflex]]. For example, the Dutch verb form ''zeg'' (\"say\", pronounced {{IPA|[z\u025bx]}}) became ''s\u00ea'' ({{IPA|[s\u025b\u02d0]}}) in Afrikaans, as did the infinitive ''zeggen'', pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8z\u025b\u0263\u0259(n)]}}. Another example is the Dutch ''leggen'' (\"to lay\", pronounced {{IPA|[l\u025b\u0263\u0259(n)]}}), which becomes ''l\u00ea'' ({{IPA|[l\u025b\u02d0]}}) in Afrikaans.\n\nAlternatively, Dutch verb form ''vraag'' (\"ask\", pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8vra\u02d0\u0263]}}) became ''vra'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8fr\u0251\u02d0]}}) in Afrikaans, which is also the equivalent of the Dutch verb ''vragen'', \"to ask\". Unlike Dutch, ''vraag'' in Afrikaans, pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8fr\u0251\u02d0\u03c7]}}, is only used as a noun meaning \"question\", with ''vrae'', pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8fr\u0251\u02d0\u0259]}}, being the plural form.\n\nThe word for \"day\" in both languages is ''dag'', but whereas the plural in Dutch is ''dagen'' ({{IPA|[da\u02d0\u0263\u0259(n)]}}), in Afrikaans it is ''dae'' ({{IPA|[d\u0251\u02d0\u0259]}}). By contrast, ''wagen'' or \"wagon\" in Dutch, pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8\u028ba\u02d0\u0263\u0259(n)]}}, became ''wa'' in Afrikaans, ({{IPA|[\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0]}}), with the plural form, ''wagens'', pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8\u028ba\u02d0\u0263\u0259ns]}}, became ''wa\u00ebns'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0\u0259ns]}}).\n\n====Circumflex==== \nIn contrast to Dutch, where the use of the [[circumflex]] is essentially limited to French borrowings, like ''enqu\u00eate'', Afrikaans makes frequent use of {{angbr|\u00ea}}, {{angbr|\u00f4}}, and {{angbr|\u00fb}}; examples include ''n\u00earens'' (\"nowhere\", Dutch ''nergens''), ''m\u00f4re'' (\"morning\", Dutch ''morgen''), and ''br\u00fbe'' (\"bridges\", Dutch ''bruggen'').\n\nAs a result of the disappearance of consonants found in equivalent Dutch words, particularly {{angbr|g}}, Afrikaans uses circumflexes with single vowel letters in open syllables to indicate the long monophthongal pronunciations {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}}, {{IPA|[\u0254\u02d0]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0153\u02d0]}}, as opposed to the vowel letters without a circumflex, pronounced as {{IPA|[\u026a\u0259]}}, {{IPA|[\u028a\u0259]}} and {{IPA|[y\u02d0]}}, respectively.\n\nThe circumflex is also used in {{angbr|\u00ee}}, appearing only in ''w\u00eee'' (\"wedges\", Dutch ''wiggen''), where it denotes a long pronunciation {{IPA|[\u0259\u02d0]}}, keeping the digraph {{angbr|ie}} from being pronounced {{IPA|i}}.\n\n====Diminutive====\nIn [[diminutive form]]s, Afrikaans uses {{angbr|tjie}} and {{angbr|etjie}} (normally pronounced {{IPA|[ki]}} and {{IPA|[\u0259ki]}}) where Standard Dutch would use {{angbr|tje}} (pronounced {{IPA|[c\u0259]}} or {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0283\u0259]}}). For example, whereas the diminutive of ''beet'' (\"bit\") in Dutch would be ''beetje''  (pronounced [be\u02d0t\u0361\u0283\u0259]), in Afrikaans, the diminutive of ''biet'' would be ''bietjie'' (pronounced [bi\u02d0ki]).\n\nIn [[Belgium]] and the [[Southern Netherlands]], the diminutive is often realised as {{IPA|[(s)k\u0259]}} in the spoken language. This ending is also found in some varieties of [[Dutch Low Saxon]], a group of dialects spoken in the Northeastern Netherlands. Conversely, in the [[Western Cape]], it is common to hear it realised as {{IPA|[tji]}}. The diminutive of words ending in {{angbr|k}} in Afrikaans is {{angbr|ie}}, hence whereas ''doek'' in Dutch becomes ''doekje'', in Afrikaans, it becomes ''doekie''.\n\nWhere Dutch would use {{angbr|je}}, {{angbr|pje}} and {{angbr|mpje}} (pronounced {{IPA|[j\u0259]}}, {{IPA|[pj\u0259]}} and {{IPA|[mpj\u0259]}}) Afrikaans would use   {{angbr|ie}}, {{angbr|pie}} and {{angbr|mpie}} (pronounced {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[pi]}} and {{IPA|[mpi]}}) hence the diminutives of ''glas'', ''kop'' and ''probleem'' in Dutch would become ''glaasje'', ''kopje'' and ''probleempje'', while in Afrikaans they would be ''glasie'', ''koppie'' and ''probleempie'', with an extra {{angbr|p}} being added to ''kop''. The {{angbr|ie(n)}} ending is also found in some varieties of Dutch Low Saxon: ''glassie(n)'', ''koppie(n)'', ''probleempie(n)''. In addition, the {{angbr|ie}} diminutive is used in Hollands dialects such as that of [[Amsterdam]] as well as in less formal registers of general Dutch. \"A cute little face\", for instance, can be rendered as ''Een schattig koppie''.\n\nOther words formed from diminutives in Dutch ending in {{angbr|tje}} may have different equivalents in Afrikaans; for example, the Dutch term of endearment  ''schatje'' (the diminutive of ''schat'' or \"sweetheart\", literally \"treasure\") is ''skattie'', of which ''skatjie'' is used either as the diminutive or to mean \"little treasure\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&lpg=PA93&ots=PfjIg7lSk9&dq=skattie%20afrikaans&pg=PA93#v=onepage&q=skattie%20afrikaans&f=true ''A Grammar of Afrikaans''], Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, pages 89-93</ref>\n\nIn both languages, the word for \"niece\" is a diminutive of the word for \"female cousin\", but owing to the simplification of consonant clusters in Afrikaans, ''nig'' becomes ''niggie'', using {{angbr|gie}}  in contrast to Dutch, in which ''nicht'' becomes ''nichtje''. The adjectives ''saggies'' and ''zachtjes'', both meaning \"softly\", are diminutives of Afrikaans ''sag'' and Dutch ''zacht'' respectively.\n\n=== Other spelling differences ===\n\nUnlike Dutch, the names of months in Afrikaans are capitalised, hence 2 June 2016 would be written as ''2 Junie 2016'',<ref>[https://www.mysubs.co.za/magazine/product/890401 Huisgenoot | 2 Junie 2016]</ref> whereas in Dutch, it would be written as ''2 juni 2016''.<ref>[http://digitaleeditie.nrc.nl/losseverkoop/NN/2016/5/20160602___/1_01/ nrc.next van donderdag 2 juni 2016]</ref>\n\n== Phonetic differences ==\n\nAfrikaans pronunciation tends to be closest to the dialects of the province of [[South Holland]], in particular that of [[Zoetermeer]].<ref name=\"heeringa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/~heeringa/dialectology/papers/prasa08.pdf |title=The origin of Afrikaans pronunciation: a comparison to west Germanic languages and Dutch dialects |author=Wilbert Heeringa, Febe de Wet |pages=445\u2013467 |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Groningen]] |accessdate=2010-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011940/http://www.let.rug.nl/~heeringa/dialectology/papers/prasa08.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><!--see page 3-->\n\n===Consonant mergers===\nAfrikaans merged Dutch consonants {{angbr|z}} and {{angbr|s}} to a single sound {{IPA|[s]}}, spelt {{angbr|s}}, with ''zorg'' (\"care\") and ''zout'' (\"salt\") in Dutch becoming ''sorg'' and ''sout'' in Afrikaans. A similar phonetic evolution can be found in the Northern Netherlands.\n\nAt the start of words, Afrikaans often merged Dutch voiced {{IPA|[v]}} with voiceless {{IPA|[f]}}, as in ''ver'' (\"far\"), pronounced {{IPA|[f\u025br]}} in Afrikaans and {{IPA|[v\u025br]}} in Standard Dutch. The same merger is present though in the areas around Amsterdam, where all voiced consonants merged with the voiceless ones, pronounced as the latter ones.\n\nAfrikaans merged Dutch voiced {{IPA|[w]}} with voiced {{IPA|[v]}}, as in ''werk'' (\"work\"), pronounced {{IPA|[v\u025brk]}} in Afrikaans and {{IPA|[w\u025brk]}} in Belgium and Suriname or {{IPA|[\u028b\u025brk]}} in the Netherlands. A similar near-assimilation of {{angbr|w}} to {{angbr|v}} can also be found in the Northern Netherlands, where {{angbr|w}} is pronounced {{IPA|[\u028b]}}, and {{angbr|v}} {{IPA|[v]}}.\n<!-- Afrikaans merged /v/ and /f/ as [f], whereafter [w]/[\u028b] became [v].

A similar phonetic evolution can be heard in the Northern Netherlands, where the sounds have also been merged to {{IPA|[\u03c7]}} or {{IPA|[x]}}, although the spelling difference has been retained.

However, in some Dutch varieties, such as Southern [[West Flemish]] and certain dialects of [[Dutch Low Saxon]], {{angbr|sk}} can also be heard word-medially as well as syllable-initially.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Sqy1mvIPx4wC&lpg=PA54&ots=LTlY1806OE&dq=west%20vlaams%20sk-&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q=west%20vlaams%20sk-&f=true ''West-Vlaams''], Magda Devos, Reinhild Vandekerckhove, Lannoo Uitgeverij, 2005, page 54</ref>\n\n== Grammatical differences ==\nGrammatical differences are arguably the most considerable difference between Afrikaans and Dutch, as a result of the loss of inflections in Afrikaans, as well as the loss of some verb tenses, leading to it being greatly simplified in its grammar compared to Dutch.\n\nUnlike Dutch, Afrikaans has no [[grammatical gender]], and therefore only has one form of the [[definite article]] ''die'', while standard Dutch has two (''de'' for both [[masculine noun|masculine]] and [[feminine noun]]s and ''het'' for [[neuter nouns|neuter ones]]) and Dutch dialects in the [[Southern Netherlands]] have a third, ''den'', used for masculine nouns.\n\nThe verb \"to be\" in Afrikaans is ''wees'' (from Dutch ''wezen''); the Dutch ''zijn'' only survives in Afrikaans in the form of the subjunctive ''sy'', as in ''God sy met u'' (\"God be with you\").<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&lpg=PA239&dq=%22god%20sy%20met%20u%22&pg=PA239#v=onepage&q=%22god%20sy%20met%20u%22&f=true ''A Grammar of Afrikaans''], Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, page 293</ref> In Dutch, as in Afrikaans, ''wees'' is used as an imperative, hence ''wees sterk!'' (\"be strong!\") while ''wezen'' is used as a less formal form of to be than ''zijn''.\n\n=== Verb conjugations ===\nIn Afrikaans verbs, the same form is generally used for both the infinitive and the present tense, with the exception of ''wees'' (\"to be\") conjugated as ''is'' and ''h\u00ea'' (\"to have\") conjugated as ''het'', and there is no inflection for person; contrast ''ek gaan'' (\"I go\") with ''ik ga'', ''hy doen'' (\"he does\") with ''hij doet'', and ''julle was'' (\"you (plural) were\") with ''jullie waren''.\n\nThe [[past participle]] is usually regularly formed by adding the prefix ''ge-'' to the verb, hence ''gedoen'' (\"done\") is formed from ''doen'' in Afrikaans, although Dutch ''gedaan'' survives in Afrikaans as ''welgedaan!'' (\"well done!\") One exception is the verb ''h\u00ea'' (\"to have\") of which the past participle is ''gehad'', while sometimes an irregular past participle is used with the verb ''dink'' (\"to think\") hence  ''hy het gedag'' or ''hy het gedog'', similar to Dutch ''hij heeft gedacht'', instead of ''hy het gedink''.<ref name=\"Donaldsonp223\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&lpg=PA223&dq=%22gedog%22%20%22Afrikaans%22&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q=%22gedink%22&f=false ''A Grammar of Afrikaans''], Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, page 223</ref>\n\nAll other verbs use the existing form as the past participle. For example, \"to pay\" is ''betaal'' and \"I have paid\" is \"ek het betaal\", while \"to translate\" is \"vertaal\" and \"he has translated\" is ''hy het vertaal''; Dutch would use ''betaald'' (from ''betalen'') and ''vertaald'' (from ''vertalen'') respectively.\n\n=== Verb tenses ===\n<!-- only \"had\" and \"mog\" are rarely used, and there are seven which aren't -->\nAfrikaans has dropped the simple past tense for all but a few verbs, of which five are [[modal verb|modals]], hence kon (\"could\") from ''kan'' or \"can\" and ''moes'' or \"should\" from ''moet'' or \"must\"; instead, it generally uses either the present perfect or the present tense, depending on context, the latter being used as the [[historical present]]. It has also lost the pluperfect, conjugated using ''had'', no longer used,<ref name=\"Donaldson258\" /> with the present perfect, conjugated with ''het'', being used instead.<ref name=\"Auwera\" />\n\nConsequently, the sentence ''ek het die boek vir haar gegee'' in Afrikaans can be translated into Dutch as ''ik heb het boek aan haar gegeven'' (\"I have given the book to her\") ''ik gaf het boek aan haar'' (\"I gave the book to her\") or ''ik had het boek aan haar gegeven'' (\"I had given the book to her\").\n\nHowever, the verb ''dink'' (\"to think\") still makes use of a simple past tense; for example, instead of ''ek het gedink'' to mean \"I thought\", ''ek dag'' or ''ek dog'', similar to Dutch ''ik dacht'', is sometimes used instead.<ref name=\"Donaldsonp223\" />\n\nWhereas Dutch distinguishes between verbs that use ''zijn'' (\"to be\") and verbs that use ''hebben'' (\"to have\") in the present perfect, Afrikaans has dropped this distinction, instead using ''h\u00ea'' (\"to have\"), hence \"he has been\" is ''hy '''het al''' gewees'' in Afrikaans, while ''hij '''is''' geweest'' would be used in Dutch. In [[Dutch Low Saxon]], ''hebben'' is found in the present perfect as well: ''hi'j '''hef''' (e)west''.\n\nThe past tense of the passive voice in Afrikaans uses ''is'', the present tense of ''wees'' instead of ''word'', hence ''dit '''word''' geskryf'' (\"it is written\") becomes ''dit '''is''' geskryf'' (\"it was/has been written\").<ref name=\"Donaldson258\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&lpg=PA236&dq=auxiliary%20is%20afrikaans&pg=PA257#v=snippet&q=passive&f=true ''A Grammar of Afrikaans''], Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, pages 257-258</ref> In Dutch, the passive voice can be constructed by both ''zijn'' and ''worden'', hence ''het is/wordt geschreven'', and ''het was/werd geschreven''.\n\nDutch, like English, has a continuous tense using the verb ''zijn'' (\"to be\") with ''aan het'' (\"on the\") and the infinitive, hence \"I am reading\" is ''ik ben aan het lezen'', which may be expressed periphrastically in Afrikaans as ''ek is besig om te lees'' (literally \"I am busy of to read\") or \"I am busy reading\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IZVqidxVsLwC&lpg=PA110&dq=continuous%20tense%20in%20afrikaans&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Focus on South Africa''], Vivian De Klerk, John Benjamins Publishing, 1996, page 110</ref> However, a similar grammatical construction may be found in Afrikaans using ''wees'' (\"to be\") and ''aan die'' (\"on the\") as in ''ek is aan die werk'' (\"I am working\"), though this is less common than ''ek werk'' (\"I work\"/\"I am working\").<ref name=\"Auwera\">[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rp0hYcAjlIoC&lpg=PA496&dq=%22is%20aan%20die%20werk%22&pg=PA496#v=onepage&q=%22is%20aan%20die%20werk%22&f=false ''The Germanic Languages''], Johan van der Auwera, Ekkehard K\u00f6nig, Taylor & Francis, 1994, pages 496-497</ref>\n\n===Omitting of subordinate conjunctions===\n\nIn Afrikaans, as in English, it is possible to omit the [[subordinate conjunction]] ''dat'' (\"that\"); for example, the phrase \"I believe [that] she has done it\" can be translated into Afrikaans as either ''ek glo dat sy dit gedoen het'' or ''ek glo sy het dit gedoen'' (note the change in position of the auxiliary verb ''het''), but in Dutch it is not possible to do so, hence the sentence would be translated as ''ik geloof '''dat''' ze het gedaan heeft''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DVBdAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA499&dq=afrikaans%20grammar%20subordinate%20clause%20dat&pg=PA499#v=onepage&q&f=true ''The Germanic Languages''], Ekkehard Konig, Johan van der Auwera, Routledge, December 2013, page 499</ref>\n\n===Merger of marked and unmarked forms of words===\nWhereas Dutch has unmarked and marked forms for pronouns, adverbs and indicatives, Afrikaans uses only one form; for example, whereas Dutch uses ''er'' to mean \"here\" or \"there\", Afrikaans only uses ''hier'' for \"here\" and ''daar'' for \"there\", as well as ''hiervan'' (\"hereof\") for \"of this/these\" and ''daarvan''  (\"thereof\") for \"of that/those/them\" , not ''ervan'' as in Dutch.\n\nPronouns in Afrikaans, whether [[Subject pronoun|subjects]], [[Object pronoun|objects]] or [[Possessive pronoun|possessives]], usually have only one form, derived from the Dutch marked forms; compare ''my'' in Afrikaans, which can be used either as the object \"me\" or the possessive \"my\", with Dutch marked forms ''mij'' and ''mijn'', the unmarked forms being ''me'' for \"me\" and ''m'n'' for \"my\" respectively. Whereas Dutch uses the term ''van mij, van jou, van hem, van haar, van ons, van hullie''. to mean \"mine\", \"yours\", \"his\", \"her\", \"ours\" and \"theirs\" respectively, Afrikaans uses ''myne, joune, syne, haar sunne, ons sunne'', and ''hulle sunne''.\n\nDutch uses an apostrophe in some unmarked possessive pronouns instead of the digraph {{angbr|[[IJ (digraph)|ij]]}}, hence ''zijn'' \"his\" or \"its\" becomes ''z'n'', whereas in Afrikaans, ''sy'' is not abbreviated. In Afrikaans ''sy'' also means \"she\", but Dutch equivalents ''ze'' (unmarked) and ''zij'' (marked)  mean either \"she\" as in ''ze/zij is'' (\"she is\"), or \"they\", as in ''ze/zij zijn'' (\"they are\").\n\nSimilarly, Afrikaans uses only ''jy'' as the subject \"you\" (singular) where Dutch uses ''je'' or ''jij'', ''jou'' as the object \"you\" where Dutch uses ''je'' or ''jou'', and as the possessive \"your\" where Dutch would use ''jou'' or ''jouw''.\n\n===Personal pronouns===\n\nAfrikaans, unlike Dutch, has no unmarked or marked forms of pronouns; whereas Dutch distinguishes between ''je/jij'' and ''ze/zij'' for \"you\" (singular) and \"she\" as subject pronouns, Afrikaans uses only ''jy'' and ''sy'', while whereas ''me/mij'' and ''je/jou'' are the Dutch unmarked or marked forms of object pronouns for  \"me\" and \"you\", Afrikaans only uses ''my'' and ''jou''.\n\nIt also lacks the distinction between the [[subject pronoun|subject]] and [[object pronoun|object]] form for plural [[personal pronouns]]; the [[first person plural]] pronoun in Afrikaans differs markedly from Dutch, with ''ons'' meaning either \"we\" or \"us\", in contrast to Dutch ''we'' and ''wij'', hence \"we go to the beach\" is ''ons gaan na die strand'' as opposed to ''we gaan naar het strand''.\n\nSimilarly, the [[third person plural]] pronoun in Afrikaans is ''hulle'', used to mean \"they\" or \"them\", in contrast to Dutch in which ''ze'' and ''zij'' are used as plural pronouns, hence \"they are the best\" is ''hulle is die beste'' as opposed to ''ze zijn de beste'', although ''hullie'' is encountered in Dutch dialects, particularly in [[North Brabant]] and [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=28HkERPkipMC&pg=PA223&lpg=PA223&dq=hullie+nederlands+niet+correct&source=bl&ots=_q7bT0lQg5&sig=g8ARJ9ODCCQ4i4kQrlhH_wunXOA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjt7TmrovQAhXFAsAKHcWOCmIQ6AEIqAEwEg#v=onepage&q=hullie%20nederlands%20niet%20correct&f=false ''Taalkunde voor de tweede fase van het vwo''], Hans Hulshof, Maaike Rietmeijer, Arie Verhagen, Amsterdam University Press, 2006, page 223</ref>\n\nOther possessive pronouns like ''ons'' (\"our\", inflected as ''onze'' in Dutch and ''onse'' in Afrikaans) and Dutch ''jullie'' (\"your\" plural, ''julle'' in Afrikaans) work in a similar fashion in both languages.\n\n===Demonstrative pronouns===\n\nThe word ''die'' is used in Afrikaans as a definite article, but in Dutch, it is used as a [[demonstrative pronoun]] meaning \"that\" or \"those\", or as a relative pronoun meaning \"who\", \"which\" or \"that\", for which Afrikaans would use ''wat''; compare Afrikaans ''die man wat weet'' (\"the man who knows\") with Dutch ''de man die weet''.\n\nFor demonstratives, Afrikaans uses ''hierdie'' for \"this\" or \"these\" and ''daardie'' for \"that\" or \"those\", which are shortened to ''di\u00e9'' (with an acute accent) and ''daai''.<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Ontspan/Gesondheid/dink-2-keer-oor-daai-glas-wyn-20161016 Dink 2 keer oor daai glas wyn], [[News 24 (South Africa)|News24]], 16 October 2016</ref> In Dutch, ''dit'' is used as the word for \"this\", whereas in Afrikaans it is the third-person singular impersonal pronoun meaning \"it\", with ''dis'' being a contraction of ''dit is'', similar to \"it's\" in English.\n\n=== Genitive ===\n\nAs Afrikaans has no genitive forms of nouns, the official titles of most countries include the word ''van'', although this was considered optional, hence ''Republiek '''van''' Malta'' (as opposed to ''Republiek  Malta'' as in Dutch) although ''Republiek van Suid-Afrika'' was previously considered an anglicism.<ref name=\"Donaldson93\" /> However, the [[Union of South Africa]] was known in Dutch and Afrikaans as ''Unie van Zuid-Afrika'' and ''Unie van Suid-Afrika'' respectively.<ref name=\"wetten\" />\n\nThe title \"Kingdom of the Netherlands\", which refers to the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|entire realm]] including its [[Dutch Caribbean|Caribbean islands]], is known in Afrikaans as ''Koninkryk van die Nederlande'', a direct translation of the Dutch title ''Koninkrijk der Nederlanden'', which uses the genitive article ''der'' meaning \"of the\".<ref name=\"wetten\">[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBV0005957/geldigheidsdatum_27-06-2013 Notawisseling tussen de Nederlandse en de Zuid-Afrikaanse Regering houdende een overeenkomst &#91;...&#93; het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Unie van Zuid-Afrika, Kaapstad, 20-02-1935], wetten.overheid.nl, 20 February 1935</ref>\n\nAfrikaans may form [[Compound (linguistics)#Germanic languages|compounds]] where Dutch would use separate words using the genitive or equivalent, or vice versa.

(\"is that your glass or his?\") in contrast to ''is dat jouw glas of '''het''' zijne?'' in Dutch.\n\nSimilarly, ''van'' or \"of\" is also omitted in Afrikaans; compare ''dit is my fiets, waar is joune?'' (\"that is my bike, where is yours?\") to Dutch ''dat is mijn fiets, waar is die van jou?'' However, Dutch also uses the construction ''waar is de jouwe?''\n\n=== Plural ===\n\nWhile Afrikaans uses ''-e'' as the plural of most nouns, similar to Dutch ''-en'', it also uses the ''-s''  ending where Dutch would use ''-en'', hence the plural of ''seun'' (\"son\") being ''seuns'', in contrast to Dutch, in which the plural of ''zoon'' is ''zonen'', ''zoons'' being used as a plural in eighteenth century Dutch.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hWtKAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22zoons%22&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q=%22zoons%22&f=false ''Nieuwe Nederlandsche jaerboeken''], 1784, page 9</ref>\n\nSimilarly, ''-ers'' is used as a [[double plural]] instead of ''-eren'', hence the plural of ''kind'' (\"child\") is ''kinders'', not ''kinderen'', although the plural ''kinders'' being used in nineteenth century forms of Dutch,<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UCXKKvxyPagC&dq=%22kinders%22&pg=PA267#v=onepage&q=%22kinders%22&f=false ''De Fransche taal gemakkelyk gemaakt, of duidelyke en korte manier om het Fransch te leeren en te onderwyzen''], Johan Rudolph Wurstysen, St.-Jacobs-straat, No. 753, 1806, page 267</ref> including [[West Flemish]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fp-eP8-JVfMC&dq=%22kinders%22&pg=PA148#v=onepage&q=%22kinders%22&f=false ''Annales de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Emulation de Bruges''], Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Emulation pour l'Histoire et les Antiquit\u00e9s de la Flandre Occidentale, 1866, page 148</ref>\n\n=== Double negative === \nA notable feature of Afrikaans is its use of a [[double negative]], which is absent in standard Dutch (yet still exists in some dialects like [[West Flemish]]).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7ec2TKXlEAC |title=Negative sentences in the languages of Europe: a typological approach. |accessdate=2010-05-19 |first1=Giuliano |last1=Bernini |first2=Paolo |last2=Ramat |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |year=2007}}</ref> For example, Dutch ''Ik spreek '''geen''' Engels'' (I do not speak English) in Afrikaans becomes ''Ek praat '''nie''' Engels '''nie'''.'' Similar constructions can be found in [[French language|French]] (''Je <u>ne</u> parle <u>pas</u> anglais'') but also in West Flemish (''k <u>en</u> klappe <u>geen</u> Engels'') as well as in other Dutch dialects in the southern part of Holland (''Ik praat geen Engels nie'')\n\n=== Adjective inflections ===\nLike Dutch, adjectives in Afrikaans are generally inflected (with a number of exceptions) in the attributive position (when preceding the noun) and not in the predicative. Unlike Dutch, this inflection depends only on position, not grammatical gender; for example, ''nasionaal'', when followed by ''party'' becomes ''nasionale'', hence ''Nasionale Party''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bHAdAQAAMAAJ&q=Nasionale+Party&dq=Nasionale+Party&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLmN72i5DQAhViOMAKHVGECjoQ6AEIMTAD ''Die Nasionale Party: die eerste bewindsjare 1924-1934''], J. H. Le Roux, P. W. Coetzer,  Instituut vir Eietydse Geskiedenis, U.O.V.S. Academica, 1980, page 2</ref>\n\nThis also applies to adjectives from which the final \"t\" has been dropped, for example, while \"first\" is ''eers'', not ''eerst'', \"first time\" is ''eers'''te''' keer'' in both languages;<ref>[http://www.nu.nl/tennis/4320054/wawrinka-wint-eerste-keer-titel-us-open.html Wawrinka wint voor eerste keer titel op US], [[NU.nl]], 12 September 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Local/Kouga-Express/dodelike-pes-tref-sa-tamaties-eerste-keer-wat-is-tuta-absoluta-20161102 Dodelike pes tref SA tamaties eerste keer], [[News 24 (South Africa)|News24]], 3 November 2016</ref> similarly, while \"bad\" is ''sleg'' in Afrikaans (instead of Dutch ''slecht''), the \"t\" is reintroduced in inflected form, hence ''sleg'''te''' tye''<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Stemme/Kommentaar/Rapport-se-Slegte-tye-Reaksie-is-ons-keuse-20150425 Rapport s\u00ea: Slegte tye?

By contrast, the Dutch term ''rijbewijs'', translates as \"driving certificate\", but while ''ry'' is used in Afrikaans to mean \"driving\", ''bewys'' means \"evidence\" or \"proof\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1H6BP6SMMGkC&lpg=PP1&dq=afrikaans%20dictionary&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Afrikaans-English, English-Afrikaans Dictionary''], Hippocrene Books, 2001, page 22</ref>\n\nThe Dutch term for [[peanut butter]], ''pindakaas'' (literally \"peanut cheese\"), was coined because when it was first sold in the Netherlands, the term ''boter'' was a protected name and could only be used for products containing actual butter.<ref>[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/10/25/is-pindakaas-hartig-of-zoet-4976598-a1528379 Der Nederlanden: Calv\u00e9, pindakaas van;Calvinisme], ''[[Volkskrant]]'', 30 October 2010</ref> The word ''pinda'', a loanword from [[Papiamentu]], spoken in the [[Dutch Caribbean]], is ultimately of [[Kongo language|Kongo]] origin.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9_X44k9-3j8C&lpg=PA521&dq=pinda%20papiamento&pg=PA521#v=onepage&q=pinda%20papiamento&f=false ''Nederlands Etymologisch Woordenboek''], Jan De Vries, BRILL, 1987, pag 521</ref>\n\n===Comparison of vocabulary=== \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:28%;\"| Afrikaans  \n!

(\"pets, like cats and dogs,...\") could be translated into Dutch either as ''huisdieren '''als''' katten en honden''  or ''dieren '''zoals''' katten en honden...''.<ref>[http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1336/als_zoals/ Als / zoals], [[Taalunie]]</ref>\n\nWhile the Afrikaans verb ''heet'' can be used to mean \"to be called\",<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMM3R6giBDwC&lpg=PA413&dq=hy%20praat%20hollands%20afrikaans&pg=PA380#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Afrikaans for All''], Jan Nieuwoudt Tromp, Dent, 1952, page 41</ref> like the Dutch ''heten'', it is less commonly used for that purpose, hence \"what is your name?\" and \"my name is John\" would be ''wat is jou naam?'' and ''my naam is Johan'', rather than ''hoe heet jy?'' (\"how are you called?\") and ''ek heet Johan''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMM3R6giBDwC&lpg=PA413&dq=hy%20praat%20hollands%20afrikaans&pg=PA380#v=onepage&q&f=true ''A Grammar of Afrikaans''], Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, page 324</ref> By contrast, Dutch would use ''hoe heet je?'' and ''ik heet John''.\n\nIn Afrikaans, ''heet'' is used to mean \"to be said\", for example, ''soos dit heet'' (\"as it is claimed\") or, as in Dutch, \"to bid\", as in ''ek heet jou welkom'' (\"I bid you welcome\" or \"I welcome you\"). As an adjective, like the Dutch ''heet'', it means \"hot\", as in \"high temperature\", and can also mean \"fiery temper\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMM3R6giBDwC&lpg=PA413&dq=hy%20praat%20hollands%20afrikaans&pg=PA380#v=onepage&q=heet&f=true ''HAT: verklarende handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse taal''], edited by F. F. Odendal, R. H. Gouws, Pearson South Africa, 2005, page 380</ref> In Dutch, ''heet'' can also mean \"hot\" in the sense of \"spicy\" or \"horny\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ca4pc4RDdVUC&lpg=PA225&dq=english%20dutch%20dictionary&pg=PA155#v=onepage&q=heet&f=false ''The New Routledge Dutch Dictionary: Dutch-English/English-Dutch''], N. E. Osselton, R. Hempelman\nRoutledge, 2003, page 158</ref>\n\nLike ''praten'' in Dutch, the verb ''praat'' in Afrikaans means \"to talk\", but can also mean \"to speak\", where Dutch uses ''spreken''; compare ''sy praat vlot Engels'' (\"she speaks English fluently\") with ''zij spreekt vlot Engels''. However, Afrikaans uses ''sprekend'' as an adjective meaning \"speaking\", as in ''Afrikaansprekend'' (\"Afrikaans-speaking\"). ''Spreek'' is used interchangeably with ''praat'', but ''praat'' is more common.\n\nLike \"football\" in [[American English|American]] and [[Australian English]], the term ''voetbal'' is not generally used in Afrikaans to mean [[soccer]], which, unlike in Dutch, is called ''sokker''.<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Sport/Sokker/euro2016-meer-as-sokker-op-die-spel-vir-frankryk-20160610 Euro 2016: Meer as sokker op die spel vir Frankryk], ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 10 June 2016</ref> Instead, it is used in the context of other [[Code of football|codes of football]], such as [[American football]], hence ''Amerikaanse voetbal''.<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Sport/Keniaan-verruil-Kings-vir-Amerikaanse-voetbal-20130726 Keniaan 'verruil Kings vir Amerikaanse voetbal'], [[News 24 (South Africa)|Netwerk 24]], 26 July 2013</ref> In Dutch, ''soccer'' is only used to refer to the game when played in the [[United States]].<ref>[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/07/04/soccer-is-leuk-en-lucratief-ontdekken-ook-de-amerikanen-a1501049 Soccer is leuk \u00e9n lucratief, ontdekken ook de Amerikanen], ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 4 July 2014</ref> [[Rugby football|Rugby]], however, is the more popular sport amongst [[Afrikaners]].<ref>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/football-or-rugby-whose-players-are-tougher-83608687/\n</ref>\n\n===Changes due to spelling and pronunciation===\nThe changes in spelling and pronunciation in Afrikaans means that two unrelated words become [[homophone]]s and are written identically, unlike their Dutch equivalents; ''bly'' in Afrikaans, like ''blij'' in Dutch is used as an adjective to mean \"happy\", it is also a verb meaning \"to remain\", cognate with ''blijven'' in Dutch.\n\nIn Afrikaans, unlike Dutch, the word ''n\u00e1'' (meaning \"after\") is written with an [[acute accent]], as ''na'' (derived from Dutch ''naar'') means \"to\". Conversely, while the Dutch word for \"one\" is written as ''\u00e9\u00e9n'', to distinguish it from the indefinite article ''een'', in Afrikaans, ''een'' (\"one\") is written without any [[diacritics]] as the indefinite article in that language is ''\u0149''.\n\nSimilarly, the Dutch word for \"before\", ''v\u00f3\u00f3r'', may be written with acute accents on both vowels to distinguish it from ''voor'', meaning \"for\", although it is correct to write the word without them irrespective of meaning.<ref>[http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1217/vr_voor/ V\u00f3\u00f3r / voor], [[Taalunie]]</ref> By contrast, ''voor'' in Afrikaans only means \"before\", the word for \"for\" being ''vir'', and so no diacritics are required.\n\nIn both languages, ''oor'' means \"ear\", but in Afrikaans ''oor'' (derived from Dutch ''over'') can also mean \"over\" or \"about\", as in ''hy praat oor die weer'' (\"he talks about the weather\", or in Dutch ''hij spreekt over het weer'').<ref>[http://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Hy-praat-oor-die-weer-en-meer-20141128 Hy praat oor die weer, en meer], ''Netwerk24'', 28 November 2014</ref> Although Dutch and Afrikaans share a number of words prefixed with {{angbr|oor}}, such as ''oorsprong'' (\"origin\"), this is an unrelated word meaning \"original\".\n\nAlthough ''kus'' in Afrikaans can mean \"kiss\", as in Dutch, the more usual term is ''soen'', similar to Dutch ''zoen'',<ref>[http://www.huisgenoot.com/bekendes/massahisterie-volg-nadat-victoria-beckham-haar-dogtertjie-soen/ Massahisterie volg nadat Victoria Beckham haar dogtertjie soen], ''[[Huisgenoot]]'', 14 July 2016</ref> as the [[homophone]] ''kus'' means \"coast\". In contrast to the Dutch equivalents ''kus'' and ''kust'' (plural ''kussen'' and ''kusten''), it is only in their inflected plural forms ''kusse'' and ''kuste'' that the two Afrikaans words can be clearly distinguished.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMM3R6giBDwC&lpg=PA413&dq=hy%20praat%20hollands%20afrikaans&pg=PA639#v=onepage&q&f=true ''HAT: verklarende handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse taal''], edited by F. F. Odendal, R. H. Gouws, Pearson South Africa, 2005, page 639</ref>\n\n===False friends due to English influence===\nEnglish language influence has also resulted in changes in the meanings of some Afrikaans words, such as ''eventueel'', which now means \"eventual\" or \"eventually\", rather than \"possibly\", as in Dutch.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&lpg=PA207&ots=PfjIcblSk6&dq=eventueel%20afrikaans%20dutch&pg=PA207#v=onepage&q=eventueel%20afrikaans%20dutch&f=true ''A Grammar of Afrikaans''], Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, page 207</ref> Consequently, some Afrikaans dictionaries give both meanings, with the entry for ''eventueel'' listing ''uitendelik'' (\"finally\") as well as ''moontlik'' (\"possible\") as definitions.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0I6CvubZf0gC&lpg=PA182&vq=eventueel&dq=%22skietparty%22&pg=PA166#v=snippet&q=eventueel&f=false ''Makro Blokraaisels Woordeboek''], L.L. Pansegrouw, Pearson South Africa, 1998, page 166</ref> However, the latter is described as ''Nederlandisties'' or \"Dutch-influenced\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMM3R6giBDwC&lpg=PA413&dq=hy%20praat%20hollands%20afrikaans&pg=PA226#v=onepage&q&f=true ''HAT: verklarende handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse taal''], edited by F. F. Odendal, R. H. Gouws, Pearson South Africa, 2005, page 226</ref>\n \nBy contrast, other Afrikaans words cognate with Dutch ones retain the same meaning, such as ''aktueel'', which, like ''actueel'' in Dutch, means \"up to date\" or \"concerned with current affairs\", although ''aktualiteit'' can also mean \"reality\" in the sense of the English word \"actuality\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMM3R6giBDwC&lpg=PA413&dq=hy%20praat%20hollands%20afrikaans&pg=PA39#v=onepage&q=aktueel&f=false ''HAT: verklarende handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse taal''], edited by F. F. Odendal, R. H. Gouws, Pearson South Africa, 2005, page 226</ref> The Dutch word ''actualiteit'', on the other hand, only means \"topicality\" or \"current events\". Dutch also previously spelled both ''actueel'' and ''actualiteit'' with a \"k\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eJlKaUpjInUC&lpg=PA199&dq=aktualiteit&pg=PA199#v=onepage&q=aktualiteit&f=false ''Middeleeuwse wijsbegeerte: traditie en vernieuwing''], Uitgeverij Van Gorcum, 1977, page 198-199</ref>\n\n===Colloquialisms===\nAnother consequence of the two languages diverging has been the differences between colloquialisms, meaning that a word in Dutch which has no offensive connotations is used as an expletive or term of abuse in Afrikaans, and vice versa, although other changes in meanings have also arisen.\n\nFor example, the Afrikaans phrase ''die meisie gooi haar flikkers'' (\"the girl throws her sparkle\") was highlighted by the Dutch journalist, [[Derk-Jan Eppink]], in an article in the daily ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', as an example of differences in meaning.<ref>[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1990/03/27/artikel-ontketent-polemiek-over-afrikaans-maagbom-6926523-a716110 Artikel ontketent polemiek over Afrikaans; Maagbom voorkaaskop], ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 27 March 1990</ref> In Afrikaans, ''flikkers by iemand gooi'' means to [[Flirting|flirt]] with someone,<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=keVT5aIL9fAC&lpg=PA147&ots=lCWP-IxSmG&dq=die%20meisie%20gooi%20haar%20flikkers&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q=die%20meisie%20gooi%20haar%20flikkers&f=true ''HAT: verklarende handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse taal''], edited by F. F. Odendal, R. H. Gouws, Pearson South Africa, 2005, page 147</ref> but in Dutch, ''flikker'' means a male homosexual, while ''flikker op!'' is akin to the [[British English]] expletive \"bugger off!\"<ref>[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/11/01/japke-dflikker-op-met-je-punt-op-de-horizon-5064719-a1529599 Flikker op met je punt op de horizon], ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 1 November 2016</ref>\n\n===List of words with different meanings===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:28%;\"| Word \n!
