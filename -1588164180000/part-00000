It is one of the few stations with no surrounding business district, due to William Chorley placing [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] on the surrounding land.\n\nThe [[M2 Hills Motorway]] runs along the southern border of the suburb. For many years, Sutherland Road ran through both Beecroft and Cheltenham, and acted as a short cut between Beecroft Road and Epping Road. This road ran to the east of the Railway line and, during peak hour, was quite busy.With the opening of the [[M2 Hills Motorway]] in 1997, Sutherland Road was closed at the Devlins Creek bridge - where the M2 enters a tunnel under North Epping. The result of this closure is that the areas east of the railway line are now very quiet and the house values have benefitted.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Cheltenham Railway Station 2.JPG|Cheltenham station from the bridge on Cheltenham Road\nImage:Cheltenham_tunnel-1w.jpg|Devlins Creek, in flood under the M2, looking to Sutherland Road\n</gallery>\n\n==Schools==\n[[Cheltenham Girls High School|Cheltenham Girls' High School]], a government school is located along Beecroft Road and The Promenade.

Residents of Cheltenham often shop in [[Beecroft, New South Wales|Beecroft]], [[Pennant Hills, New South Wales|Pennant Hills]] or [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]].

The next most common country of birth was China at 8.2%.  The most common ancestries in Cheltenham were English 23.0%, Australian 21.1%, Chinese 15.5%, Irish 7.6% and Scottish 7.4%. 69.3% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 8.5% and Cantonese 7.1%. The median age was 43 years, five years older than the national median of 38. Children aged under 15 made up 18.2% of the population and people aged 65 and over made up 16.3% of the population. The median weekly household income in Cheltenham was $3,170, more than double the national median weekly income of $1,438. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 34.2%, Anglican 16.6% and Catholic 14.4%.<ref name=Census2016/>\n\n==Transport==\n[[Cheltenham railway station, Sydney|Cheltenham railway station]] is on the one [[Northern Line (Sydney)|Northern Line]] of the [[Sydney Trains]] network. It is one of the few stations with no surrounding business district, due to William Chorley placing [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] on the surrounding land.\n\nThe [[M2 Hills Motorway]] runs along the southern border of the suburb. For many years, Sutherland Road ran through both Beecroft and Cheltenham, and acted as a short cut between Beecroft Road and Epping Road. This road ran to the east of the Railway line and, during peak hour, was quite busy.With the opening of the [[M2 Hills Motorway]] in 1997, Sutherland Road was closed at the Devlins Creek bridge - where the M2 enters a tunnel under North Epping. The result of this closure is that the areas east of the railway line are now very quiet and the house values have benefitted.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Cheltenham Railway Station 2.JPG|Cheltenham station from the bridge on Cheltenham Road\nImage:Cheltenham_tunnel-1w.jpg|Devlins Creek, in flood under the M2, looking to Sutherland Road\n</gallery>\n\n==Schools==\n[[Cheltenham Girls High School|Cheltenham Girls' High School]], a government school is located along Beecroft Road and The Promenade. Beecroft Public School and Arden Anglican School are primary schools in nearby Beecroft{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.\n\n==Commercial area==\nFrom its early days, Cheltenham was almost exclusively a residential suburb with no shopping area developed at all in its planning. Residents of Cheltenham often shop in [[Beecroft, New South Wales|Beecroft]], [[Pennant Hills, New South Wales|Pennant Hills]] or [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]]. The nearest shopping mall is in [[Carlingford, New South Wales|Carlingford]].\n\n==Ahimsa==\n\nAhimsa (an Indian word meaning non-violence) is the name of a bush retreat located in Cobran Road. It was originally the home of the environmentalist [[Marie Byles]], who died in the house in 1979. It can be accessed at the rear of Day Road and Cobran Road (both roads are cul-de-sacs). The site is administered by the [[National Trust of Australia]].

''NR-1'' was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 25 January 1969, completed initial sea trials 19 August 1969, and was home-ported at [[Naval Submarine Base New London]]. ''NR-1'' was the smallest nuclear submarine ever put into operation. The vessel was casually known as \"Nerwin\" and was never officially named or [[ship commissioning|commissioned]]. The U.S. Navy is allocated a specific number of warships by the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]]. [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Hyman Rickover]] avoided using one of those allocations, and he also wanted to avoid the oversight that a warship receives from various bureaus.\n\n==History==\n''NR-1''{{'}}s missions included search, object recovery, geological survey, oceanographic research, and installation and maintenance of underwater equipment. ''NR-1'' had the unique capability to remain at one site and completely map or search an area with a high degree of accuracy, and this was a valuable asset on several occasions.<ref name=doe_2016_p64>{{cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/08/f36/nuclear_propulsion_program_8-30-2016%5B1%5D.pdf#page=70|pages=64-65|date=November 2015|access-date=30 January 2020|quote=Able to remain submerged and move at maximum speed for extended periods of time, she performed detailed studies and mapping of the ocean bottom (including temperature, currents, and other oceanographic data) for military and scientific uses.

''NR-1'' was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 25 January 1969, completed initial sea trials 19 August 1969, and was home-ported at [[Naval Submarine Base New London]]. ''NR-1'' was the smallest nuclear submarine ever put into operation. The vessel was casually known as \"Nerwin\" and was never officially named or [[ship commissioning|commissioned]]. The U.S. Navy is allocated a specific number of warships by the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]]. [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Hyman Rickover]] avoided using one of those allocations, and he also wanted to avoid the oversight that a warship receives from various bureaus.\n\n==History==\n''NR-1''{{'}}s missions included search, object recovery, geological survey, oceanographic research, and installation and maintenance of underwater equipment. ''NR-1'' had the unique capability to remain at one site and completely map or search an area with a high degree of accuracy, and this was a valuable asset on several occasions.<ref name=doe_2016_p64>{{cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/08/f36/nuclear_propulsion_program_8-30-2016%5B1%5D.pdf#page=70|pages=64-65|date=November 2015|access-date=30 January 2020|quote=Able to remain submerged and move at maximum speed for extended periods of time, she performed detailed studies and mapping of the ocean bottom (including temperature, currents, and other oceanographic data) for military and scientific uses.

The ship is equipped and has the capacity for work near or on the seabed performing sample gathering recovery implantation or repair of objects in the ocean. The installed equipment can be supplemented by scientist-supplied sensors to conduct experiments and obtain knowledge of the ocean's chemical, thermal, optical, biological, and acoustical dharacteristics.}}\n\n''NR-1'' was equipped with two electric motor-driven propellers and its maneuverability was enhanced by four ducted thrusters, two forward and two aft.

They ate frozen TV dinners, bathed once a week with a bucket of water, and burned [[Chemical oxygen generator#Oxygen candle|chlorate candles]] to produce oxygen. The sub was so slow that it was towed to sea by a surface vessel, and so tiny that the crew felt the push and pull of the ocean's currents. \"Everybody on ''NR-1'' got sick,\" said Allison J.
