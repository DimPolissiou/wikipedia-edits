Soon after, they independently recorded and released two EPs in limited quantities (250\u2013500 units): ''All Hallows Eve EP'' (2004) and ''Hell Demo'' (2006). Evile toured extensively throughout the UK (2004\u20132006) and Netherlands (2006), played as the support act for [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] and eventually signed to [[Earache Records]]. Though Earache had received the band's ''Hell Demo'', it was after label head [[Digby Pearson]] witnessed Evile's set at [[Bloodstock Open Air]] in 2006 that he contacted the band and signed them to the label. In an interview Matt Drake said that the band was originally supposed to be called \"Exile\", but there were \"a million other bands that called themself that\" so the \"X\" in the band's name was changed to a \"V,\" and the band became known as Evile.<ref name=\"digevile\">{{cite web | title=Evile Metal Mayhem Interview | work=Metal Mayhem | url=http://www.metal-mayhem.co.uk/interviews/evile.html | accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>\n\n===''Enter the Grave'' (2007\u20132009)===\n[[File:Evile live in SB.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Evile live in Saarbr\u00fccken 2010]]\nPrior to the album's recording, [[Matt Drake]] contacted producer [[Flemming Rasmussen]] ([[Metallica]], [[Morbid Angel]], [[Blind Guardian]], [[Artillery (band)|Artillery]]) by doing a search for his name on [[Google]] and enquired as to whether or not he would like to hear Evile's material.

We had a few ideas floating around which were out of the ordinary for Evile, and when Mike passed away those ideas just started to make more and more sense. \"In Memoriam\"'s initial intention was for Mike and Mike alone. All of us in the band have different views and thoughts on what the song means and who it is for, but it was born out of a want to include something special for Mike, his family and ourselves. As the song grew it started to take on a life of its own, so to speak. It is for anyone who's lost anyone close to them. There is a lot of meaning behind this song, and I expect a few people will question Evile doing such a song, but if the sentiment isn't understood, I couldn't care less.

I wondered what we could do to the track to make it our own, so we approached it like we would one of our own songs. That bass riff is brilliant and I wanted to make it more a core element of the track guitar-wise and just metal it up in general.

It's been well documented why the song exists. When it came to getting the \"right\"/\"appropriate\" treatment for the video, it was a lengthy process. The song is so close to all of us that we wanted to make sure the video complemented the song and its subject matter, and that all four of us were happy with how the song will be portrayed visually. If we'd have settled on the first idea after \"Cult\", we wouldn't have been happy, so amidst touring and gigging, we've been working hard on getting this 100% before we move on to the next video. The song is basically about loss, which we can all relate to, so we wanted to express that in the video, while staying respectful to why the song exists. We can't wait to get this filmed and out there for all to enjoy!</blockquote>\n\n===''Skull'' and the departure of Ol Drake (2013\u20132015)===\nOn 31 January 2013, Ol Drake announced via his Tumblr that Evile were to begin recording their fourth album the following weekend.

Evile toured extensively throughout the UK (2004\u20132006) and Netherlands (2006), played as the support act for [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] and eventually signed to [[Earache Records]]. Though Earache had received the band's ''Hell Demo'', it was after label head [[Digby Pearson]] witnessed Evile's set at [[Bloodstock Open Air]] in 2006 that he contacted the band and signed them to the label. In an interview Matt Drake said that the band was originally supposed to be called \"Exile\", but there were \"a million other bands that called themself that\" so the \"X\" in the band's name was changed to a \"V,\" and the band became known as Evile.<ref name=\"digevile\">{{cite web | title=Evile Metal Mayhem Interview | work=Metal Mayhem | url=http://www.metal-mayhem.co.uk/interviews/evile.html | accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>\n\n===''Enter the Grave'' (2007\u20132009)===\n[[File:Evile live in SB.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Evile live in Saarbr\u00fccken 2010]]\nPrior to the album's recording, [[Matt Drake]] contacted producer [[Flemming Rasmussen]] ([[Metallica]], [[Morbid Angel]], [[Blind Guardian]], [[Artillery (band)|Artillery]]) by doing a search for his name on [[Google]] and enquired as to whether or not he would like to hear Evile's material.

We had a few ideas floating around which were out of the ordinary for Evile, and when Mike passed away those ideas just started to make more and more sense. \"In Memoriam\"'s initial intention was for Mike and Mike alone. All of us in the band have different views and thoughts on what the song means and who it is for, but it was born out of a want to include something special for Mike, his family and ourselves. As the song grew it started to take on a life of its own, so to speak. It is for anyone who's lost anyone close to them. There is a lot of meaning behind this song, and I expect a few people will question Evile doing such a song, but if the sentiment isn't understood, I couldn't care less.

I was a big fan of Nirvana when I was a young teen, so it's an extra honor in that way for me. I wondered what we could do to the track to make it our own, so we approached it like we would one of our own songs. That bass riff is brilliant and I wanted to make it more a core element of the track guitar-wise and just metal it up in general. I wanted to respect the approach of the song but also alter Kurt's [Cobain] chord approach to a style more suited to EVILE, and that's a chug-athon!</blockquote>\n\nIn October Evile celebrated the release of ''Five Serpent's Teeth'' by taking part in in-store signing sessions in select Blue Banana stores as well as a short tour of Release Shows in the UK; London, Birmingham and Holmfirth.<ref name=\"BlueBanana\">{{cite web | title=Evile schedule signings | work=Blabbermouth.net | url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=163212 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201092938/http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=163212 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2013-02-01 | accessdate=2012-05-02 }}</ref> On 17 October The band were featured in a Live Session on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''Rock Show'' with [[Daniel P.

It's been well documented why the song exists. When it came to getting the \"right\"/\"appropriate\" treatment for the video, it was a lengthy process. The song is so close to all of us that we wanted to make sure the video complemented the song and its subject matter, and that all four of us were happy with how the song will be portrayed visually. If we'd have settled on the first idea after \"Cult\", we wouldn't have been happy, so amidst touring and gigging, we've been working hard on getting this 100% before we move on to the next video. The song is basically about loss, which we can all relate to, so we wanted to express that in the video, while staying respectful to why the song exists. We can't wait to get this filmed and out there for all to enjoy!</blockquote>\n\n===''Skull'' and the departure of Ol Drake (2013\u20132015)===\nOn 31 January 2013, Ol Drake announced via his Tumblr that Evile were to begin recording their fourth album the following weekend.

{"title_page": "1960 24 Hours of Le Mans", "text_new": "{{Le Mans Races\n| Previous = 1959\n| Current = 1960\n| Next = 1961\n}}\nThe '''1960 24 Hours of Le Mans''' was the 28th [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] Grand Prix of Endurance, and took place on 25 and 26 June 1960, on [[Circuit de la Sarthe]].  It was the fifth and final round of the [[1960 World Sportscar Championship season|F.I.A. World Sports Car Championship]] as well as being the fifth round of the inaugural FIA GT Cup. It was held just a week after the tragic [[1960 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian F1 GP]] in which four drivers, including [[Stirling Moss]] were either killed or seriously injured. The prospect of a duel between the {{Convert|3|l|cuin|adj=on}} [[Ferrari]] versus the {{Convert|2|l|cuin|adj=on}} [[Porsche]] championship-leaders was enough to draw large crowds to the 24 Hours race and some 200,000 spectators had gathered for Europe's classic sports car race, around the {{Convert|13.5|km||abbr=on|adj=on}} course.\n[[File:Le_Mans_Circuit_de_la_Sarthe_1932-1967.png|thumb|300px|Le Mans in 1960]]\n\nFaced with a must-win result to take the World Championship, Ferrari came well-prepared and with 13 entries, from the works and privateer teams. Their main competition would come from Maserati and the British teams, although American Corvettes also made an appearance in the GT-category. The race was barely three hours old when torrential rain hit the circuit causing a number of accidents and issues as water got into the engines. More and more rivals fell away through the night leaving Ferrari to dominate the race. In the end its Sports and GT cars taking 7 of the top 8 places, with only the Aston Martin of the Scottish Border Reivers team in 3rd breaking the sequence. Belgian [[Olivier Gendebien]] got his second victory, this time with his countryman, sports journalist/racing-driver, [[Paul Fr\u00e8re]] in the works car. Through fast, but reliable, driving they were never seriously threatened, finishing four laps and over 50km ahead of the second-placed Ferrari.\n\n==Regulations==\nAfter its overhaul of the GT classes in its Appendix J regulations, the CSI (Commission Sportive Internationale - the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]\u2019s regulations body) looked at retro-fitting them to the Appendix C rules for Sports Cars. \n\nThere were fourteen classes based on engine capacity (with a maximum of {{Convert|5|l|cuin}} although the World Championship was only open to a {{Convert|3|l|cuin|adj=on}} maximum<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.109\"> Clausager 1982, p.109</ref>) with corresponding set fuel tank sizes. But it was the minimum height and width of widescreens (based on those of GT cars) that caused controversy and after the first round in Argentina a number of senior drivers had protested about the danger in poor weather.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.18\">Spurring 2010, p.18</ref> There were also new provisions for minimum luggage space, carrying the spare wheel inboard, a minimum ground clearance of {{Convert|120|mm||abbr=on}} and a maximum turning-circle of {{Convert|13.5|m|}}.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.18\">Spurring 2011, p.18</ref><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.81\"> Moity 1974, p.81</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

Although some bodywork changes could be done the net weight could not change by more than 5%.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.18\"/>\n\nWith the new fuel-tank sizes, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) dropped the minimum distance between fuel refills but kept the 25-lap limit for the other fluids. The maximum single-stint for a driver was increased to 52 laps (about 4 hours), although the total driver time was still 14 hours.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.18\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.81\"/> To be classified, cars had to complete the last lap in less than 30 minutes, and stay within 20% of their nominated Index distance at every 6 hour interval.<ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.46\"> Clarke 2009, p.46: Autocar Jun24 1960</ref>\n\nTo promote their new Index of Thermal Efficiency fuel-economy competition, this year the ACO increased the prize money at the expense of the older Index of Performance. After the 1960 currency devaluation, the winner's purse was now 30000 New Francs (about \u00a36750 equivalent at the time) and 2000 New Francs respectively (and 50000 New Frances for the overall distance winner). The Index calculations were also tweaked slightly to account for the bigger windscreens reducing top speeds.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.18\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.48\"> Clarke 2009, p.48: Autocar Jun24 1960</ref>\n\n==Entries==\nThe ACO received 72 entries for the event, of which only 58 were allowed to practice trying to qualify for the 55 places on the grid (increasing by one from the 54 of previous years).<ref>http://www.racingsportscars.com/race/Le_Mans-1960-06-26.html</ref><ref>http://www.lemans-history.com/provas.php?ano=1960</ref> Official \u2018works\u2019 entries numbered 27, but a number of companies gave strong support to their customer teams.

Four works cars arrived: two were updated [[Ferrari TR|Testarossas]] and two were the new TRI chassis with independent suspension. Driving the updated TR59/60s this year the experienced pairing of [[Olivier Gendebien|Gendebien]] & [[Phil Hill]] were split up. Belgian Gendebien was paired with compatriot [[Paul Fr\u00e8re]] (who had been second in 1959 for Aston Martin), while Hill was driving with fellow Ferrari F1 team-member [[Wolfgang von Trips]]. One of the newer TRIs were driven by the other Scuderia F1 drivers [[Willy Mairesse]]/[[Richie Ginther]] and the second by youngsters [[Ludovico Scarfiotti]]/ [[Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez]]. A 1959-model Testarossa was also run by [[Luigi Chinetti]]\u2019s [[North American Racing Team]] (NART), driven by the older Rodriguez brother, [[Pedro Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Pedro]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Pilette]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.20\">Spurring 2010, p.20</ref>\n\nEven though the company was still having financial difficulties, this year marked the successful return of [[Maserati]] to sports car racing with the highly competitive [[Maserati Tipo 61|Tipo 61 \u2018Birdcage\u2019]], raced by American Lloyd Casner's [[Casner Motor Racing Division|Camoradi Racing Team]]. The new team, sponsored by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tyres, had just caused an upset winning the previous race in the championship at the [[1960 1000 km N\u00fcrburgring|N\u00fcrburgring]]. Three cars were entered, driven by Casner himself with Jim Jeffords, [[Gino Munaron]]/[[Giorgio Scarlatti]], while [[Masten Gregory]] and [[Chuck Daigh]] drove the updated original prototype. Designer [[Giulio Alfieri]] had carefully interpreted the CSI windscreen rules which specified a height but not an angle. So with a windscreen almost half the length of the car, it was very aerodynamic and very fast \u2013 reaching {{Convert|170|mph||abbr=on|round=5}} on the Mulsanne straight, compared to the Testarossa's {{Convert|160|mph||abbr=on|round=5}}.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.23\">Spurring 2010, p.23</ref><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.79\"> Moity 1974, p.79</ref>\n\nThis year there were four British cars in the premier class. Ecurie Ecosse entered the 6-year old D-Type that had finished 2nd in [[1957 24 Hours of Le Mans|1957]], modified with an enlarged windscreen and luggage hump, detracting from its formerly elegant lines. It was driven by [[Ron Flockhart (racing driver)|Ron Flockhart]] and [[Bruce Halford]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.35\">Spurring 2010, p.35</ref> Their local rivals, Jock McBain's Border Reivers team ran an equally modified Aston Martin DBR, with the previous year's winner [[Roy Salvadori]] this year partnered with rising star [[Jim Clark]]. The Aston Martin that won [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans|that race]] had been bought by Ian Baillie, a Major in the [[Grenadier Guards]] who had [[Jack Fairman]] as co-driver.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.29\">Spurring 2010, p.29</ref>\n\nThe other British car caused a sensation and marked a welcome return to Le Mans for American [[Briggs Cunningham]]. Jaguar Cars had worked with Cunningham, their New York dealer, to prepare one of their new E-type prototypes for competition. The 3-litre XK-engine developed 290&nbsp;bhp (against the Testarossa's 300&nbsp;bhp) giving a top speed of {{Convert|158|mph||abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.26\">Spurring 2010, p.26</ref> Americans [[Dan Gurney]] and [[Walt Hansgen]] were the drivers.\n\nAfter two outright wins (at [[1960 12 Hours of Sebring|Sebring]] and the [[1960 Targa Florio|Targa Florio]]) Porsche came to Le Mans as leaders of the Championship with its new RS60 variant. But with a top speed of only 145&nbsp;mph (235&nbsp;kp/h) they would be no match for the bigger cars on the long straight. Working with the new rules, they fitted two cars with special 1606cc engines (generating 180&nbsp;bhp) to put them into the 2-litre category with the consequent bigger fuel tank. They were also the only team to fit wipers on both the inside and outside of the windscreens.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.31\">Spurring 2010, p.31</ref> This year the works cars were driven by [[Joakim Bonnier|Jo Bonnier]]/[[Graham Hill]] and [[Hans Herrmann]]/ [[Maurice Trintignant]]. [[Edgar Barth]] / [[Wolfgang Seidel]] drove the regular RS60, supported again by the two privateer entries from [[Carel Godin de Beaufort]] and Jean Kerguen.\n\nTriumph returned to take on the Porsches with their TRS prototype of the upcoming [[Triumph TR4|TR4]], led once again by former winner [[Ninian Sanderson]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.37\">Spurring 2010, p.37</ref>  The privateer MG that raced the previous year also returned. In the smaller classes there were single entries from Alfa Romeo and the new [[Lola Cars|Lola]] company competing in the S-1150 class. The Lola Mk 1 was fitted with the Coventry Climax FWA engine, developing 90&nbsp;bhp. It was also the lightest car in the field, only {{Convert|567|kg||abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.81\"/>\n\nIn the next class down, S-1000, two works DB-Panhards would vie with Austin-Healey returning to the circuit with their new [[Austin-Healey Sebring Sprite|Sprite]]. In the busy smallest class there were eleven entries including four DB-Panhards, as well as Stanguellini, OSCA and a trio of cars from Fiat performance-specialists [[Abarth]]. Reflecting changing times, the six DB-Panhard sports were the only French cars in the field this year.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.24\">Spurring 2010, p.24</ref>\n\nThere were 22 entries in the GT classes. The largest cars in the race were four {{Convert|4.6|l|cuin|adj=on}} V8 [[Chevrolet Corvette]]s after a good showing at [[1960 12 Hours of Sebring|Sebring]]. The [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Rochester smallblock engine]] generated over 300&nbsp;bhp and got up to {{Convert|150|mph||abbr=on}}. Stopping the heavy cars would be an issue and many thought they would suffer from brake problems on the tight corners like at the end of the long Mulsanne Straight.<ref>http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z9082/Chevrolet-Corvette-LeMans-Racer.aspx</ref> Three were entered by [[Briggs Cunningham]], returning to Le Mans after five years away. He drove one with Bill Kimberly, with the others by [[Dick Thompson (racing driver)|Dick Thompson]]/Fred Windridge and Cunningham team-regular [[John Fitch (racing driver)|John Fitch]]/Bob Grossman. The fourth Corvette was entered by the Camoradi team.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.28\">Spurring 2010, p.28</ref><ref>http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z9082/Chevrolet-Corvette-LeMans-Racer.aspx</ref>\n\nUp against them was a squadron of eight [[Ferrari 250|Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta]]s. [[Mauro Forghieri|Forghieri's]] new short-wheelbase variant had just been homologated on raceweek. The V12 3-litre engine produced 280&nbsp;bhp with a top speed of {{Convert|160|mph||abbr=on|round=5}}. Three were entered by Chinetti's NART, two more by the Belgian [[Ecurie Francorchamps]] and [[Ecurie Nationale Belge|Equipe Nationale Belge]]. There were also entries from the new Italian [[Scuderia Serenissima]], Graham Whitehead (changing from running Jaguar and Aston Martin) and Le Mans local Fernand Tavano who had only received his car at the start of the week.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.35\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.64\"> Clarke 2009, p.64: Motor Jun29 1960</ref>\n\nLotus dominated the middle categories with the five Elites. One of the three works cars had been given the {{Convert|2|l|cuin|adj=on}} FPF Climax engine to enter the GT-2000 class against a pair of privateer AC Aces.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.26\"/> Porsche entered a new coup\u00e9 version of the 356, styled by Abarth and capable of over {{Convert|140|mph||abbr=on|round=5}}. It would be driven by [[Herbert Linge]] and [[Heini Walter]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.33\">Spurring 2010, p.33</ref>\n\n==Practice==\nAfter the success last year, the ACO was again able to close the public roads on 9 April. Fourteen cars took advantage of the 10 hours of extended testing time.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.18\"/>\n\nOfficial qualifying was held over two sessions for a total of 540 minutes over the two days and there were two major accidents. On Wednesday evening after having just done a fast qualifying lap, Dan Gurney in his Jaguar E2A collided at {{Convert|150|mph||abbr=on|round=5}} with Fritz d\u2019Orey's Sc. Serenissima Ferrari GT. D\u2019Orey's car speared off the track and hit a roadside tree with such force that it broke the car in two. The young Brazilian suffered severe head injuries that kept him in hospital for 8 months. On Thursday, Jonathon Sieff's Team Lotus car had catastrophic suspension collapse while on the Mulsanne straight. He hit a small hut and the [[Marcus Sieff, Baron Sieff of Brimpton|Marks & Spencer heir]] was badly injured.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.17\"/> Out of caution, Lotus withdrew its {{Convert|2|l|cuin|adj=on}} GT as it was fitted with the same suspension units.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.26\">Spurring 2011, p.26</ref>\n\nOn Friday, when the roads were public domain once again, the repaired Jaguar went out for test laps finding its handling was not perfect.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.26\"/>\n\n==Race==\n===Start===\nWith no [[Stirling Moss]] at the race, it was the equally fleet-footed Jim Clark who was first away in his Aston Martin. But he was soon overtaken, firstly by Walt Hansgen in the Jaguar prototype, then the extremely fast Camoradi Maserati. After a delayed start Masten Gregory blasted past twenty cars to be leading at the end of the first lap. He set about building a considerable lead, getting out to 70 seconds at the end of an incident-free first hour. The five Testarossas, led by Gendebien, were 2nd through 6th, then came the Ecosse Jaguar, Scarlatti's Maserati and Tavano leading the GT classes ahead of Clark in 10th.\n\nBut it was as the first pit-stops were approaching that things started going wrong. The increased drag on the enlarged windscreens meant fuel consumption was increased. Two of the Ferraris, pushing hard to keep up with the Maserati were caught out and both von Trips and Scarlatti ran out of fuel ending up marooned out on the track on their 22nd lap. Gendebien was extremely lucky to run out just as he approached the pits, and coasted into his pit-box.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.20\">Spurring 2011, p.20</ref> Then when Gregory brought in the Maserati from the lead to refuel and change drivers the car refused to restart. They lost nearly an hour, and 11 laps, while the starter motor was replaced. Rejoining in 46th place they made up 17 places before soaked electrics put them out after midnight.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.19\">Spurring 2011, p.19</ref> Refueled, Fr\u00e8re, then Gendebien, took a lead they would never relinquish.\n\nGoing into the third hour it started to rain heavily, even hailing at times, creating havoc on the track. With the windscreens impossible to see through, many drivers pitted for cushions to allow them to see over the screens.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.19\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.58\"> Clarke 2009, p.58: Motor Jun29 1960</ref> Bill Kimberley had just taken over Cunningham's Corvette, sent out by his team manager on [[Racing slick|slick tyres]] when he aquaplaned off at Maison Blanche, rolled end-over-end twice then slid down the grass ending right side up. Fortunately Kimberly was unhurt.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.28\">Spurring 2011, p.28</ref><ref>http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z9082/Chevrolet-Corvette-LeMans-Racer.aspx</ref>\n\nAt 8pm, after four hours, Gendebien and Fr\u00e8re had a lap's lead over the field. Gunther/Mairesse led the chase ahead of the NART Ferrari and Ecosse Jaguar then, a lap further back, the Aston Martin & Tavano leading the GT classes.\n\n===Night===\nGoing into the night, with the better handling Aston Martin, and superb car control, Clark and Salvadori were able to catch up and overtake the Ferraris, getting up to second place soon after 11pm. The rain then eased allowing the power of the Ferraris to come to bear again. At midnight, after 8 hours racing, Gendebien still led from Ginther/Mairesse, then the Aston Martin, Rodriguez\u2019 Ferrari and the Ecosse Jaguar. In 6th was Whitehead's Ferrari leading the GTs, chased by the Fitch/Grossman Corvette and the French & Belgian Ferrari GTs. In 10th was the first Porsche, of Barth/Seidel, with a handy lead over the rest of the smaller cars. \n\nThe final Maserati (Casner's own) retired with engine issues likely caused by debris from Casner's slip into the Tertre Rouge sand-trap.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.23\">Spurring 2011, p.23</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.55\"> Clarke 2009, p.55: Car and Driver Oct 1960</ref> The E-type lost three laps at the start with fuel-injection issues, had fought back to the edge of the top-10, lost time with burnt pistons then retired with a blown head gasket after midnight.\n\nLater through the night Pedro Rodriguez put in very fast laps moving up from 5th to catch, pass and then lap Mairesse into second, only to lose it again when he was stopped for ten minutes to fix a misfire. The Ecosse Jaguar had been running third and fourth through the night until at dawn at 5.30am it came to a halt at Arnage with a broken camshaft.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.35\">Spurring 2011, p.35</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.63\"> Clarke 2009, p.63: Motor Jun29 1960</ref>  It was the end of the illustrious D-type story at Le Mans.\n\n===Morning===\nBy Sunday morning, the rain had cleared and the sun was shining. About 8.15am, with Gendebien/ Fr\u00e8re now holding a 5-lap lead,<ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.63\"/> the Ginther/Mairesse Ferrari's gearbox gave up, handing second place back to the NART car, now well ahead of the Aston Martin. Through most of the race the Laureau/Armagnac DB had been leading the Index of Performance from the Guichet/Condriller Abarth, with one of the Porsches back in 3rd.  The Porsches had been falling away through the night. After being delayed at the start, the Hill/Bonnier car had got back up to 14th until it too was stopped with engine problems. It was the smaller car of Barth/Seidel that had been the best performer, getting up to 9th and mixing it with the Ferrari and Corvette GTs when it started getting gearbox problems.\n\nThe Ferrari GTs had all been running strongly. The Whitehead/Taylor car, after initially leading the GT pack until midnight, had been chasing the French Ferrari of Tavano running in 4th. Then at 12.45 when Taylor was travelling at full speed down the Mulsanne straight the engine detonated with such force it blew the bonnet of the car.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p. 53\">Spurring 2011, p.35</ref>\n\n===Finish and post-race===\nWith the retirements, the remaining Corvette of Fitch/Grossman had moved up to 6th. Then with barely two hours Grossman came in with no water, well before the next fluid refill. Fetching ice from their VIP tent, the crew packed it around the engine instructing the driver to do 10-minute laps, attracting great attention from the crowd.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.29\">Spurring 2011, p.29</ref> Then the gearbox of the Barth Porsche lost three of it gears with a couple of hours to go. The team parked it up waiting for the last quarter-hour to make a fraught final lap. In the meantime it was overtaken by the Porsche GT that finished 10th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.33\">Spurring 2011, p.33</ref>\n\nOtherwise, the last part of the race was processional. The winning partnership of Gendebien and Fr\u00e8re, averaged a speed of {{Convert|106.201|mph||abbr=on}}, and their winning margin over the second placed crew was four laps, driven by [[Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Pilette]]. Coming home third, a further four laps adrift, was 1959 winner [[Roy Salvadori]] with Jim Clark in their Aston Martin, breaking up the Ferrari train. The Ferrari GTs followed up their 3-4-5-6 result in 1959 with a 4-5-6-7, forming up in a formation finish behind the leading Testarossas.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.teamdan.com/archive/wsc/1960/60lemans.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170724/http://www.teamdan.com/archive/wsc/1960/60lemans.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.racingsportscars.com/race/Le_Mans-1960-06-26.html</ref> The Corvette struggled on, finishing 8th, before the engine seized completely just after the finishing line. The other Aston Martin, despite leaking oil for most of the race they stayed consistent and finished 9th.\n\nOnce again the bullet-proof Panhard-engined DBs performed very well, four of the five cars finishing. The {{Convert|851|cc||abbr=on|adj=on}} coup\u00e9 of Bouharde and Jaeger ran an impressive {{Convert|32|mpgimp||abbr=on}} fuel economy. The open-top spyder of Armagnac and Laureau comfortably won the Index of Performance going over 25% than its nominal distance. They were also the final winners of the Biennial Cup for best performance over consecutive years.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.25\">Spurring 2011, p.25</ref>\n\nBut it was the two surviving Lotus Elites that carried off the Thermal Efficiency prize \u2013 the works car just beating the French privateer entry. The three Triumphs staged a formation finish, however after battling valve problems all race none could cover their mandatory distance and were not classified.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.37\">Spurring 2011, p.37</ref> British cars also won class trophies \u2013 the privateer MG was first 2-litre car home and the Austin-Healey Sprite beat the DBs in the 1-litre class.\n\nA proud day for Belgium with three of the drivers in the first two cars coming from that country. The Belgian Prince de M\u00e9rode was the honorary starter in his role as President of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]], and on hand to congratulate his countrymen at the end of the race. Likewise the [[Baudouin of Belgium|Belgian king]] sent telegrams of congratulations to the drivers.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.21\">Spurring 2011, p.21</ref><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.81\"/> After this success, Paul Fr\u00e8re retired from racing, to resume his regular employment as a motoring journalist, and consultant on motor-racing regulations.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.21\"/>\n\n==Official results==\n=== Finishers===\nResults taken from Quentin Spurring's book, officially licensed by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest|ACO]]<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.2\">Spurring 2010, p.2</ref>\n''Class Winners are in '''Bold''' text.''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\"\n!

It was the fifth and final round of the [[1960 World Sportscar Championship season|F.I.A. World Sports Car Championship]] as well as being the fifth round of the inaugural FIA GT Cup. It was held just a week after the tragic [[1960 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian F1 GP]] in which four drivers, including [[Stirling Moss]] were either killed or seriously injured. The prospect of a duel between the {{Convert|3|l|cuin|adj=on}} [[Ferrari]] versus the {{Convert|2|l|cuin|adj=on}} [[Porsche]] championship-leaders was enough to draw large crowds to the 24 Hours race and some 200,000 spectators had gathered for Europe's classic sports car race, around the {{Convert|13.5|km||abbr=on|adj=on}} course.\n[[File:Le_Mans_Circuit_de_la_Sarthe_1932-1967.png|thumb|300px|Le Mans in 1960]]\n\nFaced with a must-win result to take the World Championship, Ferrari came well-prepared and with 13 entries, from the works and privateer teams. Their main competition would come from Maserati and the British teams, although American Corvettes also made an appearance in the GT-category. The race was barely three hours old when torrential rain hit the circuit causing a number of accidents and issues as water got into the engines. More and more rivals fell away through the night leaving Ferrari to dominate the race. In the end its Sports and GT cars taking 7 of the top 8 places, with only the Aston Martin of the Scottish Border Reivers team in 3rd breaking the sequence. Belgian [[Olivier Gendebien]] got his second victory, this time with his countryman, sports journalist/racing-driver, [[Paul Fr\u00e8re]] in the works car. Through fast, but reliable, driving they were never seriously threatened, finishing four laps and over 50km ahead of the second-placed Ferrari.\n\n==Regulations==\nAfter its overhaul of the GT classes in its Appendix J regulations, the CSI (Commission Sportive Internationale - the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]\u2019s regulations body) looked at retro-fitting them to the Appendix C rules for Sports Cars. \n\nThere were fourteen classes based on engine capacity (with a maximum of {{Convert|5|l|cuin}} although the World Championship was only open to a {{Convert|3|l|cuin|adj=on}} maximum<ref name=\"Clausager 1982, p.109\"> Clausager 1982, p.109</ref>) with corresponding set fuel tank sizes. But it was the minimum height and width of widescreens (based on those of GT cars) that caused controversy and after the first round in Argentina a number of senior drivers had protested about the danger in poor weather.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.18\">Spurring 2010, p.18</ref> There were also new provisions for minimum luggage space, carrying the spare wheel inboard, a minimum ground clearance of {{Convert|120|mm||abbr=on}} and a maximum turning-circle of {{Convert|13.5|m|}}.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.18\">Spurring 2011, p.18</ref><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.81\"> Moity 1974, p.81</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

Although some bodywork changes could be done the net weight could not change by more than 5%.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.18\"/>\n\nWith the new fuel-tank sizes, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) dropped the minimum distance between fuel refills but kept the 25-lap limit for the other fluids. The maximum single-stint for a driver was increased to 52 laps (about 4 hours), although the total driver time was still 14 hours.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.18\"/><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.81\"/> To be classified, cars had to complete the last lap in less than 30 minutes, and stay within 20% of their nominated Index distance at every 6 hour interval.<ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.46\"> Clarke 2009, p.46: Autocar Jun24 1960</ref>\n\nTo promote their new Index of Thermal Efficiency fuel-economy competition, this year the ACO increased the prize money at the expense of the older Index of Performance. After the 1960 currency devaluation, the winner's purse was now 30000 New Francs (about \u00a36750 equivalent at the time) and 2000 New Francs respectively (and 50000 New Frances for the overall distance winner). The Index calculations were also tweaked slightly to account for the bigger windscreens reducing top speeds.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.18\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.48\"> Clarke 2009, p.48: Autocar Jun24 1960</ref>\n\n==Entries==\nThe ACO received 72 entries for the event, of which only 58 were allowed to practice trying to qualify for the 55 places on the grid (increasing by one from the 54 of previous years).<ref>http://www.racingsportscars.com/race/Le_Mans-1960-06-26.html</ref><ref>http://www.lemans-history.com/provas.php?ano=1960</ref> Official \u2018works\u2019 entries numbered 27, but a number of companies gave strong support to their customer teams.

Four works cars arrived: two were updated [[Ferrari TR|Testarossas]] and two were the new TRI chassis with independent suspension. Driving the updated TR59/60s this year the experienced pairing of [[Olivier Gendebien|Gendebien]] & [[Phil Hill]] were split up. Belgian Gendebien was paired with compatriot [[Paul Fr\u00e8re]] (who had been second in 1959 for Aston Martin), while Hill was driving with fellow Ferrari F1 team-member [[Wolfgang von Trips]]. One of the newer TRIs were driven by the other Scuderia F1 drivers [[Willy Mairesse]]/[[Richie Ginther]] and the second by youngsters [[Ludovico Scarfiotti]]/ [[Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez]]. A 1959-model Testarossa was also run by [[Luigi Chinetti]]\u2019s [[North American Racing Team]] (NART), driven by the older Rodriguez brother, [[Pedro Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Pedro]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Pilette]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.20\">Spurring 2010, p.20</ref>\n\nEven though the company was still having financial difficulties, this year marked the successful return of [[Maserati]] to sports car racing with the highly competitive [[Maserati Tipo 61|Tipo 61 \u2018Birdcage\u2019]], raced by American Lloyd Casner's [[Casner Motor Racing Division|Camoradi Racing Team]]. The new team, sponsored by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tyres, had just caused an upset winning the previous race in the championship at the [[1960 1000 km N\u00fcrburgring|N\u00fcrburgring]]. Three cars were entered, driven by Casner himself with Jim Jeffords, [[Gino Munaron]]/[[Giorgio Scarlatti]], while [[Masten Gregory]] and [[Chuck Daigh]] drove the updated original prototype. Designer [[Giulio Alfieri]] had carefully interpreted the CSI windscreen rules which specified a height but not an angle. So with a windscreen almost half the length of the car, it was very aerodynamic and very fast \u2013 reaching {{Convert|170|mph||abbr=on|round=5}} on the Mulsanne straight, compared to the Testarossa's {{Convert|160|mph||abbr=on|round=5}}.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.23\">Spurring 2010, p.23</ref><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.79\"> Moity 1974, p.79</ref>\n\nThis year there were four British cars in the premier class. Ecurie Ecosse entered the 6-year old D-Type that had finished 2nd in [[1957 24 Hours of Le Mans|1957]], modified with an enlarged windscreen and luggage hump, detracting from its formerly elegant lines. It was driven by [[Ron Flockhart (racing driver)|Ron Flockhart]] and [[Bruce Halford]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.35\">Spurring 2010, p.35</ref> Their local rivals, Jock McBain's Border Reivers team ran an equally modified Aston Martin DBR, with the previous year's winner [[Roy Salvadori]] this year partnered with rising star [[Jim Clark]]. The Aston Martin that won [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans|that race]] had been bought by Ian Baillie, a Major in the [[Grenadier Guards]] who had [[Jack Fairman]] as co-driver.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.29\">Spurring 2010, p.29</ref>\n\nThe other British car caused a sensation and marked a welcome return to Le Mans for American [[Briggs Cunningham]]. Jaguar Cars had worked with Cunningham, their New York dealer, to prepare one of their new E-type prototypes for competition. The 3-litre XK-engine developed 290&nbsp;bhp (against the Testarossa's 300&nbsp;bhp) giving a top speed of {{Convert|158|mph||abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.26\">Spurring 2010, p.26</ref> Americans [[Dan Gurney]] and [[Walt Hansgen]] were the drivers.\n\nAfter two outright wins (at [[1960 12 Hours of Sebring|Sebring]] and the [[1960 Targa Florio|Targa Florio]]) Porsche came to Le Mans as leaders of the Championship with its new RS60 variant. But with a top speed of only 145&nbsp;mph (235&nbsp;kp/h) they would be no match for the bigger cars on the long straight. Working with the new rules, they fitted two cars with special 1606cc engines (generating 180&nbsp;bhp) to put them into the 2-litre category with the consequent bigger fuel tank. They were also the only team to fit wipers on both the inside and outside of the windscreens.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.31\">Spurring 2010, p.31</ref> This year the works cars were driven by [[Joakim Bonnier|Jo Bonnier]]/[[Graham Hill]] and [[Hans Herrmann]]/ [[Maurice Trintignant]]. [[Edgar Barth]] / [[Wolfgang Seidel]] drove the regular RS60, supported again by the two privateer entries from [[Carel Godin de Beaufort]] and Jean Kerguen.\n\nTriumph returned to take on the Porsches with their TRS prototype of the upcoming [[Triumph TR4|TR4]], led once again by former winner [[Ninian Sanderson]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.37\">Spurring 2010, p.37</ref>  The privateer MG that raced the previous year also returned. In the smaller classes there were single entries from Alfa Romeo and the new [[Lola Cars|Lola]] company competing in the S-1150 class. The Lola Mk 1 was fitted with the Coventry Climax FWA engine, developing 90&nbsp;bhp. It was also the lightest car in the field, only {{Convert|567|kg||abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.81\"/>\n\nIn the next class down, S-1000, two works DB-Panhards would vie with Austin-Healey returning to the circuit with their new [[Austin-Healey Sebring Sprite|Sprite]]. In the busy smallest class there were eleven entries including four DB-Panhards, as well as Stanguellini, OSCA and a trio of cars from Fiat performance-specialists [[Abarth]]. Reflecting changing times, the six DB-Panhard sports were the only French cars in the field this year.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.24\">Spurring 2010, p.24</ref>\n\nThere were 22 entries in the GT classes. The largest cars in the race were four {{Convert|4.6|l|cuin|adj=on}} V8 [[Chevrolet Corvette]]s after a good showing at [[1960 12 Hours of Sebring|Sebring]]. The [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Rochester smallblock engine]] generated over 300&nbsp;bhp and got up to {{Convert|150|mph||abbr=on}}. Stopping the heavy cars would be an issue and many thought they would suffer from brake problems on the tight corners like at the end of the long Mulsanne Straight.<ref>http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z9082/Chevrolet-Corvette-LeMans-Racer.aspx</ref> Three were entered by [[Briggs Cunningham]], returning to Le Mans after five years away. He drove one with Bill Kimberly, with the others by [[Dick Thompson (racing driver)|Dick Thompson]]/Fred Windridge and Cunningham team-regular [[John Fitch (racing driver)|John Fitch]]/Bob Grossman. The fourth Corvette was entered by the Camoradi team.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.28\">Spurring 2010, p.28</ref><ref>http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z9082/Chevrolet-Corvette-LeMans-Racer.aspx</ref>\n\nUp against them was a squadron of eight [[Ferrari 250|Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta]]s. [[Mauro Forghieri|Forghieri's]] new short-wheelbase variant had just been homologated on raceweek. The V12 3-litre engine produced 280&nbsp;bhp with a top speed of {{Convert|160|mph||abbr=on|round=5}}. Three were entered by Chinetti's NART, two more by the Belgian [[Ecurie Francorchamps]] and [[Ecurie Nationale Belge|Equipe Nationale Belge]]. There were also entries from the new Italian [[Scuderia Serenissima]], Graham Whitehead (changing from running Jaguar and Aston Martin) and Le Mans local Fernand Tavano who had only received his car at the start of the week.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.35\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.64\"> Clarke 2009, p.64: Motor Jun29 1960</ref>\n\nLotus dominated the middle categories with the five Elites. One of the three works cars had been given the {{Convert|2|l|cuin|adj=on}} FPF Climax engine to enter the GT-2000 class against a pair of privateer AC Aces.<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.26\"/> Porsche entered a new coup\u00e9 version of the 356, styled by Abarth and capable of over {{Convert|140|mph||abbr=on|round=5}}. It would be driven by [[Herbert Linge]] and [[Heini Walter]].<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.33\">Spurring 2010, p.33</ref>\n\n==Practice==\nAfter the success last year, the ACO was again able to close the public roads on 9 April. Fourteen cars took advantage of the 10 hours of extended testing time.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.18\"/>\n\nOfficial qualifying was held over two sessions for a total of 540 minutes over the two days and there were two major accidents. On Wednesday evening after having just done a fast qualifying lap, Dan Gurney in his Jaguar E2A collided at {{Convert|150|mph||abbr=on|round=5}} with Fritz d\u2019Orey's Sc. Serenissima Ferrari GT. D\u2019Orey's car speared off the track and hit a roadside tree with such force that it broke the car in two. The young Brazilian suffered severe head injuries that kept him in hospital for 8 months. On Thursday, Jonathon Sieff's Team Lotus car had catastrophic suspension collapse while on the Mulsanne straight. He hit a small hut and the [[Marcus Sieff, Baron Sieff of Brimpton|Marks & Spencer heir]] was badly injured.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.17\"/> Out of caution, Lotus withdrew its {{Convert|2|l|cuin|adj=on}} GT as it was fitted with the same suspension units.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.26\">Spurring 2011, p.26</ref>\n\nOn Friday, when the roads were public domain once again, the repaired Jaguar went out for test laps finding its handling was not perfect.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.26\"/>\n\n==Race==\n===Start===\nWith no [[Stirling Moss]] at the race, it was the equally fleet-footed Jim Clark who was first away in his Aston Martin. But he was soon overtaken, firstly by Walt Hansgen in the Jaguar prototype, then the extremely fast Camoradi Maserati. After a delayed start Masten Gregory blasted past twenty cars to be leading at the end of the first lap. He set about building a considerable lead, getting out to 70 seconds at the end of an incident-free first hour. The five Testarossas, led by Gendebien, were 2nd through 6th, then came the Ecosse Jaguar, Scarlatti's Maserati and Tavano leading the GT classes ahead of Clark in 10th.\n\nBut it was as the first pit-stops were approaching that things started going wrong. The increased drag on the enlarged windscreens meant fuel consumption was increased. Two of the Ferraris, pushing hard to keep up with the Maserati were caught out and both von Trips and Scarlatti ran out of fuel ending up marooned out on the track on their 22nd lap. Gendebien was extremely lucky to run out just as he approached the pits, and coasted into his pit-box.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.20\">Spurring 2011, p.20</ref> Then when Gregory brought in the Maserati from the lead to refuel and change drivers the car refused to restart. They lost nearly an hour, and 11 laps, while the starter motor was replaced. Rejoining in 46th place they made up 17 places before soaked electrics put them out after midnight.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.19\">Spurring 2011, p.19</ref> Refueled, Fr\u00e8re, then Gendebien, took a lead they would never relinquish.\n\nGoing into the third hour it started to rain heavily, even hailing at times, creating havoc on the track. With the windscreens impossible to see through, many drivers pitted for cushions to allow them to see over the screens.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.19\"/><ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.58\"> Clarke 2009, p.58: Motor Jun29 1960</ref> Bill Kimberley had just taken over Cunningham's Corvette, sent out by his team manager on [[Racing slick|slick tyres]] when he aquaplaned off at Maison Blanche, rolled end-over-end twice then slid down the grass ending right side up. Fortunately Kimberly was unhurt.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.28\">Spurring 2011, p.28</ref><ref>http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z9082/Chevrolet-Corvette-LeMans-Racer.aspx</ref>\n\nAt 8pm, after four hours, Gendebien and Fr\u00e8re had a lap's lead over the field. Gunther/Mairesse led the chase ahead of the NART Ferrari and Ecosse Jaguar then, a lap further back, the Aston Martin & Tavano leading the GT classes.\n\n===Night===\nGoing into the night, with the better handling Aston Martin, and superb car control, Clark and Salvadori were able to catch up and overtake the Ferraris, getting up to second place soon after 11pm. The rain then eased allowing the power of the Ferraris to come to bear again. At midnight, after 8 hours racing, Gendebien still led from Ginther/Mairesse, then the Aston Martin, Rodriguez\u2019 Ferrari and the Ecosse Jaguar. In 6th was Whitehead's Ferrari leading the GTs, chased by the Fitch/Grossman Corvette and the French & Belgian Ferrari GTs. In 10th was the first Porsche, of Barth/Seidel, with a handy lead over the rest of the smaller cars. \n\nThe final Maserati (Casner's own) retired with engine issues likely caused by debris from Casner's slip into the Tertre Rouge sand-trap.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.23\">Spurring 2011, p.23</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.55\"> Clarke 2009, p.55: Car and Driver Oct 1960</ref> The E-type lost three laps at the start with fuel-injection issues, had fought back to the edge of the top-10, lost time with burnt pistons then retired with a blown head gasket after midnight.\n\nLater through the night Pedro Rodriguez put in very fast laps moving up from 5th to catch, pass and then lap Mairesse into second, only to lose it again when he was stopped for ten minutes to fix a misfire. The Ecosse Jaguar had been running third and fourth through the night until at dawn at 5.30am it came to a halt at Arnage with a broken camshaft.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.35\">Spurring 2011, p.35</ref><ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.63\"> Clarke 2009, p.63: Motor Jun29 1960</ref>  It was the end of the illustrious D-type story at Le Mans.\n\n===Morning===\nBy Sunday morning, the rain had cleared and the sun was shining. About 8.15am, with Gendebien/ Fr\u00e8re now holding a 5-lap lead,<ref name=\"Clarke 2009, p.63\"/> the Ginther/Mairesse Ferrari's gearbox gave up, handing second place back to the NART car, now well ahead of the Aston Martin. Through most of the race the Laureau/Armagnac DB had been leading the Index of Performance from the Guichet/Condriller Abarth, with one of the Porsches back in 3rd.  The Porsches had been falling away through the night. After being delayed at the start, the Hill/Bonnier car had got back up to 14th until it too was stopped with engine problems. It was the smaller car of Barth/Seidel that had been the best performer, getting up to 9th and mixing it with the Ferrari and Corvette GTs when it started getting gearbox problems.\n\nThe Ferrari GTs had all been running strongly. The Whitehead/Taylor car, after initially leading the GT pack until midnight, had been chasing the French Ferrari of Tavano running in 4th. Then at 12.45 when Taylor was travelling at full speed down the Mulsanne straight the engine detonated with such force it blew the bonnet of the car.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p. 53\">Spurring 2011, p.35</ref>\n\n===Finish and post-race===\nWith the retirements, the remaining Corvette of Fitch/Grossman had moved up to 6th. Then with barely two hours Grossman came in with no water, well before the next fluid refill. Fetching ice from their VIP tent, the crew packed it around the engine instructing the driver to do 10-minute laps, attracting great attention from the crowd.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.29\">Spurring 2011, p.29</ref> Then the gearbox of the Barth Porsche lost three of it gears with a couple of hours to go. The team parked it up waiting for the last quarter-hour to make a fraught final lap. In the meantime it was overtaken by the Porsche GT that finished 10th.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.33\">Spurring 2011, p.33</ref>\n\nOtherwise, the last part of the race was processional. The winning partnership of Gendebien and Fr\u00e8re, averaged a speed of {{Convert|106.201|mph||abbr=on}}, and their winning margin over the second placed crew was four laps, driven by [[Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Pilette]]. Coming home third, a further four laps adrift, was 1959 winner [[Roy Salvadori]] with Jim Clark in their Aston Martin, breaking up the Ferrari train. The Ferrari GTs followed up their 3-4-5-6 result in 1959 with a 4-5-6-7, forming up in a formation finish behind the leading Testarossas.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.teamdan.com/archive/wsc/1960/60lemans.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170724/http://www.teamdan.com/archive/wsc/1960/60lemans.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.racingsportscars.com/race/Le_Mans-1960-06-26.html</ref> The Corvette struggled on, finishing 8th, before the engine seized completely just after the finishing line. The other Aston Martin, despite leaking oil for most of the race they stayed consistent and finished 9th.\n\nOnce again the bullet-proof Panhard-engined DBs performed very well, four of the five cars finishing. The {{Convert|851|cc||abbr=on|adj=on}} coup\u00e9 of Bouharde and Jaeger ran an impressive {{Convert|32|mpgimp||abbr=on}} fuel economy. The open-top spyder of Armagnac and Laureau comfortably won the Index of Performance going over 25% than its nominal distance. They were also the final winners of the Biennial Cup for best performance over consecutive years.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.25\">Spurring 2011, p.25</ref>\n\nBut it was the two surviving Lotus Elites that carried off the Thermal Efficiency prize \u2013 the works car just beating the French privateer entry. The three Triumphs staged a formation finish, however after battling valve problems all race none could cover their mandatory distance and were not classified.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.37\">Spurring 2011, p.37</ref> British cars also won class trophies \u2013 the privateer MG was first 2-litre car home and the Austin-Healey Sprite beat the DBs in the 1-litre class.\n\nA proud day for Belgium with three of the drivers in the first two cars coming from that country. The Belgian Prince de M\u00e9rode was the honorary starter in his role as President of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]], and on hand to congratulate his countrymen at the end of the race. Likewise the [[Baudouin of Belgium|Belgian king]] sent telegrams of congratulations to the drivers.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.21\">Spurring 2011, p.21</ref><ref name=\"Moity 1974, p.81\"/> After this success, Paul Fr\u00e8re retired from racing, to resume his regular employment as a motoring journalist, and consultant on motor-racing regulations.<ref name=\"Spurring 2011, p.21\"/>\n\n==Official results==\n=== Finishers===\nResults taken from Quentin Spurring's book, officially licensed by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest|ACO]]<ref name=\"Spurring 2010, p.2\">Spurring 2010, p.2</ref>\n''Class Winners are in '''Bold''' text.''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\"\n!
