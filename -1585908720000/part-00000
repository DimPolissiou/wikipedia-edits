Locked in her room, she reads most of the time.\n\nThough attractive at thirty-six, she feels past her prime, fatigued and fatalistic. After a failed early marriage roaming Europe and the death of a baby, she had drifted to Paris during the ''[[Ann\u00e9es folles]]''. She has survived for six months on 300 [[French franc|francs]] a week from ex-lover Mr Mackenzie, posted each Tuesday by high-handed solicitor Henri Legros. One Tuesday Ma\u00eetre Legros writes informing Julia he is instructed to terminate the allowance, enclosing final payment of 1,500 francs. That evening she follows Mr Mackenzie down the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] to Restaurant Albert. She sits at his table, pours herself wine from his carafe and confronts him. She ends saying she doesn't want his severance cheque, slaps him lightly around the face [[Duel|with her glove]] and walks out.\n\nFrom a nearby table Englishman George Horsfield has watched the incident. When Julia exits, Mr Horsfield follows and befriends her, buys her a drink in another caf\u00e9 and takes her to a cinema. Afterwards, seeing her cry, the awkward Mr Horsfield invites her to his hotel to talk. He pours whiskey and she describes fragments of her life since leaving London the February after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 armistice]] a decade or so earlier. When Mr Horsfield asks if she is stuck for money, she takes from her purse two ten franc notes and some coins, saying that is all she has. She recounts to him her rejection of Mr Mackenzie's severance cheque (which Mr Horsfield had witnessed in Restaurant Albert). Mr Horsfield gives her another 1,500 francs, suggests she visit London and jots down his address there.\n\n'''Part Two''' \n\nIn London Julia books into at a drab [[Bloomsbury]] hotel. The first morning she walks aimlessly, reminiscing. In [[Woburn Square]] a familiar old flower seller man ignores her when she buys his violets. On [[Tottenham Court Road]] she envisages a ghost of her younger self emerge from the fog. She crosses [[Tottenham Court Road|Oxford Street]] into [[Charing Cross Road]], gets lost in [[Soho]] and stops at a [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons tea shop]], overhearing patrons chatter while a band plays military music.\n\nReunions with her dour Uncle Griffiths and disapproving sister Norah are tense. At his [[Bayswater]] [[boarding house]] Uncle Griffiths says she should have secured a settlement from her ex-husband, prior to Mr Mackenzie. He gives her a pound note but wants little more contact. Living in [[Acton, London|Acton]], Norah has devoted her life to their sick mother, now dying, so is unsympathetic to Julia's plight. Their mother dies during Julia's London visit. Julia attends the funeral at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], causes a scene at the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] and is asked to leave.\n\nShe looks up W. Neil James Esq, her rich and generous first love from when she was nineteen. Ushered into his study, Julia sees Mr James is different. He says he has forty-five minutes. She hints at hardship, but to him this is an old story. He asks to change the subject, looks at the clock, shows her his art collection and sees her out. He posts her twenty pounds, stressing there can be no more. Some of it she spends on new clothes, some on second hand ones. She moves to a boarding house in cheaper [[Notting Hill]].\n\nMr Horsfield, also back in London, takes her for outings, meals and drinks, but withdraws his support as his interest in the troubled Julia wanes. Retreating to his [[Holland Park]] house, he promises to visit her in Paris in a week or ten days.\n\n'''Part Three''' \n\nJulia is back in her cheap Paris hotel on the Quay des Grands Augustins, overlooking the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]]. On the eleventh day she receives a letter from Mr Horsfield explaining he is unable to visit as soon as he had hoped. Enclosing ten pounds, he writes he cannot send more as times are hard. He closes by wishing her the best of luck.\n\nIn the late afternoon, from inside a caf\u00e9 on the [[rue Dauphine]], Mr Mackenzie notices Julia approach on the street. He shields his face so as not to be seen, but she sees him anyway, looks away and passes aimlessly with her head down. Having second thoughts, he leaves and catches up with her at a kerb where she waits to cross. He invites her for a drink, takes her to a caf\u00e9 and buys her a Pernod. She drinks it quickly and asks him to lend her 100 francs. Flustered, he pushes some cash across the table, which she puts in to her bag uncounted. She looks untidy, set to continue in the downward spiral of other Rhys heroines, but accepts Mr Mackenzie's offer of a second drink. He buys her another Pernod and leaves.\n\n== Background ==\nJean Rhys's material for this novel was drawn partly from her late 1927 visit to London for her mother's last days and funeral at Golders Green Crematorium. There, aged thirty-seven, she encountered estranged relatives including her aunt and sisters. This humiliating funeral scene is depicted in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''.<ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's disapproval extended back to Rhys's [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] chorus girl career, which she embarked on against parental wishes after leaving Cambridge's [[Perse School for Girls]] to enrol at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], where she lasted just two terms.<ref>Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref> Showbusiness led to her [[Demimonde|demimondaine]] phase, financed by wealthy first lover Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, until he ended the affair. A backstreet abortion followed, with Smith subsidising her London boarding house life. She became a nude art model in the prelude to [[World War I]]. Her post-war Europe jaunts with first husband Jean Lenglet ended when he served prison time in France and was deported to Holland. Rhys's failure to keep their daughter Maryvonne,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Jean-Rhys/6000000056987680063|title=Jean Rhys|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> who spent much of her infancy in care, seemed another stain on her character. Her extramarital affair in Paris with [[Ford Madox Ford]] compounded this. The Ford affair's aftermath is what ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' explores, with Julia Martin lightly slapping her ex-lover's face with an empty glove in a Paris bar, as Rhys had to Ford.<ref name=pizz2020 /><ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's indifference to the publication of ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'', and to her grief at the death of first baby William Owen Lenglet, felt unjust to Rhys, who hints at bourgeois prejudice and hypocrisy in this and most of her novels.\n\nOn the same late 1927 London visit, she met for the last time with Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, who for the last time lent her money (as with old flame Mr James in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''). Smith, like others, was tired of her suffering.\n\nBesides visiting London for these purposes, getting ''Quartet'' published necessitated her presence there. A literary agent, divorcee Leslie Tilden Smith, had offered help. In May 1928 she moved into Tilden Smith's Holland Park house (located as per Mr Horsfield's in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'') and began a relationship with him, formalising her separation from Lenglet on 19 June. Tilden Smith would become Rhys's second husband in 1934, the year after her divorce from Lenglet. By the time of ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s release in September 1928, Rhys was writing ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' with Tilden Smith's full-time support. She wrote in bed while he did the housework and proofread her pages.\n\nIn 1928 she persuaded Tilden Smith to finance a writing trip for her, alone in ''Rive Gauche'' Paris. She stayed in the Hotel Henri IV behind the Quai Grands Augustins, inhabiting the world of ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''<nowiki/>'s Julia Martin who lives in the same hotel. Julia read most of the time. Jean Rhys wrote.<ref name=pizz2020 />\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewers noted its bleakness but praised Rhys's style.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Savory, Elaine.|title=The Cambridge introduction to Jean Rhys|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-71960-8|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=611066786}}</ref> [[Rebecca West]] wrote in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'': \"Miss Jean Rhys has already in '[[The Left Bank and Other Stories|The Left Bank]]' and '[[Quartet (Jean Rhys novel)|Postures]]' quietly proved herself to be one of the finest writers of fiction under middle age, but she has also proved herself to be enamoured of gloom to an incredible degree.\" West acknowledged the quality: \"It is a terrible book about the final foundering to destruction of a friendless and worthless but pitiful woman. It is terrible, but it is superb.\"<ref>West, Rebecca, ''The Pursuit of Misery in Some New Novels'', Books of the Day, The Daily Telegraph, 30 January 1931, 7</ref>\n\n[[Gerald Gould]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' called the novel: \"A hard, clean, dry, desperate book, so rigid in its economy that its impressiveness seems almost contemptuous.\" Deeming it not a \"pleasant\" novel, Gould wrote \"it has more important merits.\" He concluded: \"Of its kind, and within its limits, this book is a flawless work of art.\"<ref>Gould, Gerald, ''All Sorts of Societies'', New Novels, The Observer 7289, 8 February 1931</ref><ref>{{Cite thesis|title=The mirror image: The representation of social roles for women in novels by Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Kate Chopin, Edith Wharton and Jean Rhys|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/nl/publications/the-mirror-image(843bf106-13d1-4fb0-b3e0-146f6b1fd32d).html|publisher=University of Groningen|date=2011|language=English|first=G.

It is no defect in the work\". Impressed by the economy of Rhys's style, he added: \"Julia\u2019s existence and the existence of those with whom she came in contact are somehow made meaningful by these very meaningless odds and ends of observation.\"<ref>Stone, Geoffrey, ''Bookman'', 74, New York, September 1931, 84</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* [[Carole Angier|Angier, Carole]], ''Jean Rhys: Life and Work'', London, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, 1990\n* Pizzichini, Lilian, ''The Blue Hour: A Life of Jean Rhys'', New York, W.

After a failed early marriage roaming Europe and the death of a baby, she had drifted to Paris during the ''[[Ann\u00e9es folles]]''. She has survived for six months on 300 [[French franc|francs]] a week from ex-lover Mr Mackenzie, posted each Tuesday by high-handed solicitor Henri Legros. One Tuesday Ma\u00eetre Legros writes informing Julia he is instructed to terminate the allowance, enclosing final payment of 1,500 francs. That evening she follows Mr Mackenzie down the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] to Restaurant Albert. She sits at his table, pours herself wine from his carafe and confronts him. She ends saying she doesn't want his severance cheque, slaps him lightly around the face with her glove and walks out.\n\nFrom a nearby table Englishman George Horsfield has watched the incident. When Julia exits, Mr Horsfield follows and befriends her, buys her a drink in another caf\u00e9 and takes her to a cinema. Afterwards, seeing her cry, the awkward Mr Horsfield invites her to his hotel to talk. He pours whiskey and she describes fragments of her life since leaving London the February after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 armistice]] a decade or so earlier. When Mr Horsfield asks if she is stuck for money, she takes from her purse two ten franc notes and some coins, saying that is all she has. She recounts to him her rejection of Mr Mackenzie's severance cheque (which Mr Horsfield had witnessed in Restaurant Albert). Mr Horsfield gives her another 1,500 francs, suggests she visit London and jots down his address there.\n\n'''Part Two''' \n\nIn London Julia books into at a drab [[Bloomsbury]] hotel. The first morning she walks aimlessly, reminiscing. In [[Woburn Square]] a familiar old flower seller man ignores her when she buys his violets. On [[Tottenham Court Road]] she envisages a ghost of her younger self emerge from the fog. She crosses [[Tottenham Court Road|Oxford Street]] into [[Charing Cross Road]], gets lost in [[Soho]] and stops at a [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons tea shop]], overhearing patrons chatter while a band plays military music.\n\nReunions with her dour Uncle Griffiths and disapproving sister Norah are tense. At his [[Bayswater]] [[boarding house]] Uncle Griffiths says she should have secured a settlement from her ex-husband, prior to Mr Mackenzie. He gives her a pound note but wants little more contact. Living in [[Acton, London|Acton]], Norah has devoted her life to their sick mother, now dying, so is unsympathetic to Julia's plight. Their mother dies during Julia's London visit. Julia attends the funeral at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], causes a scene at the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] and is asked to leave.\n\nShe looks up W. Neil James Esq, her rich and generous first love from when she was nineteen. Ushered into his study, Julia sees Mr James is different. He says he has forty-five minutes. She hints at hardship, but to him this is an old story. He asks to change the subject, looks at the clock, shows her his art collection and sees her out. He posts her twenty pounds, stressing there can be no more. Some of it she spends on new clothes, some on second hand ones. She moves to a boarding house in cheaper [[Notting Hill]].\n\nMr Horsfield, also back in London, takes her for outings, meals and drinks, but withdraws his support as his interest in the troubled Julia wanes. Retreating to his [[Holland Park]] house, he promises to visit her in Paris in a week or ten days.\n\n'''Part Three''' \n\nJulia is back in her cheap Paris hotel on the Quay des Grands Augustins, overlooking the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]]. On the eleventh day she receives a letter from Mr Horsfield explaining he is unable to visit as soon as he had hoped. Enclosing ten pounds, he writes he cannot send more as times are hard. He closes by wishing her the best of luck.\n\nIn the late afternoon, from inside a caf\u00e9 on the [[rue Dauphine]], Mr Mackenzie notices Julia approach on the street. He shields his face so as not to be seen, but she sees him anyway, looks away and passes aimlessly with her head down. Having second thoughts, he leaves and catches up with her at a kerb where she waits to cross. He invites her for a drink, takes her to a caf\u00e9 and buys her a Pernod. She drinks it quickly and asks him to lend her 100 francs. Flustered, he pushes some cash across the table, which she puts in to her bag uncounted. She looks untidy, set to continue in the downward spiral of other Rhys heroines, but accepts Mr Mackenzie's offer of a second drink. He buys her another Pernod and leaves.\n\n== Background ==\nJean Rhys's material for this novel was drawn partly from her late 1927 visit to London for her mother's last days and funeral at Golders Green Crematorium. There, aged thirty-seven, she encountered estranged relatives including her aunt and sisters. This humiliating funeral scene is depicted in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''.<ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's disapproval extended back to Rhys's [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] chorus girl career, which she embarked on against parental wishes after leaving Cambridge's [[Perse School for Girls]] to enrol at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], where she lasted just two terms.<ref>Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref> Showbusiness led to her [[Demimonde|demimondaine]] phase, financed by wealthy first lover Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, until he ended the affair. A backstreet abortion followed, with Smith subsidising her London boarding house life. She became a nude art model in the prelude to [[World War I]]. Her post-war Europe jaunts with first husband Jean Lenglet ended when he served prison time in France and was deported to Holland. Rhys's failure to keep their daughter Maryvonne,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Jean-Rhys/6000000056987680063|title=Jean Rhys|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> who spent much of her infancy in care, seemed another stain on her character. Her extramarital affair in Paris with [[Ford Madox Ford]] compounded this. The Ford affair's aftermath is what ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' explores, with Julia Martin lightly slapping her ex-lover's face with an empty glove in a Paris bar, as Rhys had to Ford.<ref name=pizz2020 /><ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's indifference to the publication of ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'', and to her grief at the death of first baby William Owen Lenglet, felt unjust to Rhys, who hints at bourgeois prejudice and hypocrisy in this and most of her novels.\n\nOn the same late 1927 London visit, she met for the last time with Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, who for the last time lent her money (as with old flame Mr James in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''). Smith, like others, was tired of her suffering.\n\nBesides visiting London for these purposes, getting ''Quartet'' published necessitated her presence there. A literary agent, divorcee Leslie Tilden Smith, had offered help. In May 1928 she moved into Tilden Smith's Holland Park house (located as per Mr Horsfield's in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'') and began a relationship with him, formalising her separation from Lenglet on 19 June. Tilden Smith would become Rhys's second husband in 1934, the year after her divorce from Lenglet. By the time of ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s release in September 1928, Rhys was writing ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' with Tilden Smith's full-time support. She wrote in bed while he did the housework and proofread her pages.\n\nIn 1928 she persuaded Tilden Smith to finance a writing trip for her, alone in ''Rive Gauche'' Paris. She stayed in the Hotel Henri IV behind the Quai Grands Augustins, inhabiting the world of ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''<nowiki/>'s Julia Martin who lives in the same hotel. Julia read most of the time.

It is located in the transition area between the [[Natural Park Monta\u00f1a Palentina]] and the [[Tierra de Campos]] in the province [[Spain]] of [[Palencia]] ([[Castilla y Le\u00f3n]]), on the upper side of the Triangle formed by [[Salda\u00f1a, Palencia|Salda\u00f1a]], [[Carri\u00f3n de los Condes]] and [[Herrera de Pisuerga]] and located at the foot of the route [[Camino de Santiago|Jacobea]] that linked [[San Vicente de la Barquera]] with Carri\u00f3n de los Condes through the [[Royal way of La Valdavia]].\n\nIt is on the right bank of the [[Valdavia River]], joined by the road ''PP-2454'' called ''camino vecinal'' (0.8 km) to the kilometre 21.2 of the provincial road ''P236''.\n\n== Physical data ==\n[http://maps.google.es/?ie=UTF8&t=h&lci=lmc:panoramio,lmc:wikipedia_es&ll=42.538015,-4.573982&spn=0.007605,0.019999&z=16 Map of Villamelendro de Valdavia]\n\n* Distance to Palencia: 75.6 km\n* Distance to Burgos: 88.1 km\n* Distance to Le\u00f3n: 131.3 km\n* Distance to Santander: 155.6 km\n\nCrossed by the [[Valdavia River]] from north to south, Villamelendro is on its right bank.\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Northwest = [[Villabasta de Valdavia]]\n| North = [[Villaeles de Valdavia]]\n| Northeast = [[Villaeles de Valdavia]]<br />[[Collazos de Boedo]] \n| West = [[Vega de Do\u00f1a Olimpa]]\n| Center = Villamelendro de Valdavia\n| East = [[San Mart\u00edn del Monte]]\n| Southwest = [[Vega de Do\u00f1a Olimpa]]<br />[[Villasila de Valdavia]]\n| South = [[Villasila de Valdavia]]\n| Southeast = [[Villasila de Valdavia]]\n}}\n\n== Demographic evolution ==\n{{historical populations|align=none|cols=3\n| 2000| 28\n| 2001| 27\n| 2002| 24\n| 2003| 21\n| 2004| 19\n| 2005| 18\n| 2006| 17\n| 2007| 17\n| 2008| 16\n| 2009| 16\n| 2010| 16\n| 2011| 16\n| 2008| 12\n}}\n\n== Urban development ==\n[[File:Villamelendro vista general 001.JPG|thumb|Vista General del Pueblo.

On the other hand, crossing the ''arroyo de Matafrades'', on the southern slope of the ''alto de la Horca'', there was a permanent source of drinking water that guaranteed the provision of any settlement. And finally, both ruins and fountain were at the confluence of a crossroads. \n\nFrom the West, coming from the Morcorio, the ''old road of Salda\u00f1a'' arrived, through Vega de Do\u00f1a Olimpa. This road, crossing the river Valdavia, would project itself along the so-called ''road of cows'' in the direction of [[Sotoba\u00f1ado y Priorato]] and would cross with another, the ''royal road of Valdavia'', on the northwest-southeast axis that would run through the region of Valdavia parallel to the river. \n\nFrom [[Congosto de Valdavia|Congosto]], passing through [[La Puebla de Valdavia|La Puebla]], [[Buenavista de Valdavia|Buenavista]], the depopulated area of Santa Mar\u00eda de Villaverde, [[Polvorosa de Valdavia|Polvorosa]], [[Renedo de Valdavia|Renedo]], [[Arenillas de San Pelayo]], always on the left bank until it reaches Villaeles where it would cross the river and continue on its right bank along the river terraces that are not flooded, entering Villamelendro by the Villabasta road. Then it would cross the whole village until it left by the ''Arnillas'' path towards the Villanes de [[Villanu\u00f1o de Valdavia|Villanu\u00f1o]] and [[B\u00e1rcena de Campos]] to connect at the height of the ''Esperina'' with the [[Camino_de_Santiago_del_Norte:_Ruta_del_Besaya|camino del Besaya]] towards Carri\u00f3n de los Condes. \n\nIt is the establishment of buildings along this road that gives an elongated shape to the town centre, articulating around the Calle Mayor, which is the name taken by the ''camino real de la Valdavia'' as it passes through Villamelendro.\n\n=== Construction phases ===\nThe village has two clearly differentiated construction phases. \n\nDepending on the position of the Church, the village fountain and the area where the Roman [[vicus]] was presumably located, we can deduce a first phase in which the oldest part of the urban centre would be the one in the far north. Specifically, the group of houses that go from the slope where the ''camino de Villabasta'' arrives to the ''calle Sol''. This means that the intersection of the ''Calle Mayor'' with the ''Calle Cantarranas'' is the area where the original settlement of the repopulation village was structured, gradually projecting towards the river in the direction of the ''Calle de las Huertas'' which would close the complex from the east. \n\nOn the other hand, a second phase, where the rest of the houses that are to the South of the ''Calle Sol'' are being built, which although now it is in the center of the village, takes its name at a time when it was the southern end of the village, being the first street of the village to which the sun was shining at dawn. This evolution was the result of population growth and improved production conditions in the area from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n\n=== Local road ===\nThe Camino Real de la Valdavia, together with the Camino Viejo de Salda\u00f1a, would be the main communication routes through which goods and travellers would arrive at the village, the Camino Real de la Valdavia being the main artery of the valley. Although there was a wooden bridge and lawns about 30 metres to the north of the current bridge, it was not until 1948 that this was built and the local road connecting to the Valdavia road was asphalted, which is the main axis of communication today.\n\n== Illustrious sons ==\n* [[Lucas Espinosa]] (1895-1975): father Augustin and eminent Palencia philologist born in [[Villabasta de Valdavia|Villabasta]], but that spent long seasons in Villamelendro.

Brick doorway of [[semicircular arch]], preceded by a cobbled portico and an arched access doorway to [[sardinel]], on the Epistle side. The interior consists of a single nave, separated by ashlar arches in three bodies covered with [[groin_vault]] and a high wooden choir at the feet. On the side of the presbytery is the main altarpiece from the first half of the 17th century with paintings on the bench of the [[Annunciation]] and [[Adoration]] of the Shepherds, flanked by four small panels representing the [[Fathers of the Church]], from left to right: St [[Augustine of Hippo]], St [[Gregory the Great]], St [[Ambrose of Milan]] and St [[Jerome of Stridon]] on which four columns [[Corinthian Order]] are supported as an allegory for the pillars of the Church. The altarpiece is articulated around a central niche with the image of [[Asunci\u00f3n]] presiding and in the side streets four panels with paintings of the martyrdom of [[Julita y Quirico]], and in the attic Crucifix. [[Tabernacle]] with relief of the [[Resurrection]] on the door. The current work dates mostly from the 16th century, and presented problems from early times. It was necessary to reinforce the building with period buttresses so that they would reinforce the pressures that the groin vaults projected outwards. In the area of the apse it is reinforced with very thick but low buttresses, as in this area the church tends to open up as well. In the cemetery area, the base of these buttresses are eroded by humidity and burials, leaving the building unprotected. That is why in the mid-20th century the arch of the presbytery was reinforced with a double tensor that gave it stability. The second arch of the nave, however, is increasingly giving way inwards, endangering the integrity of the second vault. This is the reason why this building is included in the [[Red List of Heritage]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://listarojapatrimonio.org/ficha/iglesia-nuestra-senora-la-asuncion/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029145310/https://listarojapatrimonio.org/ficha/iglesia-nuestra-senora-la-asuncion/ |archivedate=29 October 2019 }}</ref>of the Association for the care and promotion of Heritage [[Hispania Nostra]] since November 2019.\n\n== History ==\nThe first written mention of this town under the name of \"Uilla Melendi\", along with other neighbouring villages, takes place in 1175 in a manuscript volume belongs to the [[monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Retuerta]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Ant\u00f3n|first=Francisco|publisher=Valladolid : Maxtor, 2005.|title=Monasterios medievales de la provincia de Valladolid|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=dkyqFU1ZNbEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|ref=N\u00famero 19 \u2013 (Crism\u00f3n).

On the other hand, crossing the ''arroyo de Matafrades'', on the southern slope of the ''alto de la Horca'', there was a permanent source of drinking water that guaranteed the provision of any settlement. And finally, both ruins and fountain were at the confluence of a crossroads. \n\nFrom the West, coming from the Morcorio, the ''old road of Salda\u00f1a'' arrived, through Vega de Do\u00f1a Olimpa. This road, crossing the river Valdavia, would project itself along the so-called ''road of cows'' in the direction of [[Sotoba\u00f1ado y Priorato]] and would cross with another, the ''royal road of Valdavia'', on the northwest-southeast axis that would run through the region of Valdavia parallel to the river. \n\nFrom [[Congosto de Valdavia|Congosto]], passing through [[La Puebla de Valdavia|La Puebla]], [[Buenavista de Valdavia|Buenavista]], the depopulated area of Santa Mar\u00eda de Villaverde, [[Polvorosa de Valdavia|Polvorosa]], [[Renedo de Valdavia|Renedo]], [[Arenillas de San Pelayo]], always on the left bank until it reaches Villaeles where it would cross the river and continue on its right bank along the river terraces that are not flooded, entering Villamelendro by the Villabasta road. Then it would cross the whole village until it left by the ''Arnillas'' path towards the Villanes de [[Villanu\u00f1o de Valdavia|Villanu\u00f1o]] and [[B\u00e1rcena de Campos]] to connect at the height of the ''Esperina'' with the [[Camino_de_Santiago_del_Norte:_Ruta_del_Besaya|camino del Besaya]] towards Carri\u00f3n de los Condes. \n\nIt is the establishment of buildings along this road that gives an elongated shape to the town centre, articulating around the Calle Mayor, which is the name taken by the ''camino real de la Valdavia'' as it passes through Villamelendro.\n\n=== Construction phases ===\nThe village has two clearly differentiated construction phases. \n\nDepending on the position of the Church, the village fountain and the area where the Roman [[vicus]] was presumably located, we can deduce a first phase in which the oldest part of the urban centre would be the one in the far north. Specifically, the group of houses that go from the slope where the ''camino de Villabasta'' arrives to the ''calle Sol''. This means that the intersection of the ''Calle Mayor'' with the ''Calle Cantarranas'' is the area where the original settlement of the repopulation village was structured, gradually projecting towards the river in the direction of the ''Calle de las Huertas'' which would close the complex from the east. \n\nOn the other hand, a second phase, where the rest of the houses that are to the South of the ''Calle Sol'' are being built, which although now it is in the center of the village, takes its name at a time when it was the southern end of the village, being the first street of the village to which the sun was shining at dawn. This evolution was the result of population growth and improved production conditions in the area from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n\n=== Local road ===\nThe Camino Real de la Valdavia, together with the Camino Viejo de Salda\u00f1a, would be the main communication routes through which goods and travellers would arrive at the village, the Camino Real de la Valdavia being the main artery of the valley. Although there was a wooden bridge and lawns about 30 metres to the north of the current bridge, it was not until 1948 that this was built and the local road connecting to the Valdavia road was asphalted, which is the main axis of communication today.\n\n== Illustrious sons ==\n* [[Lucas Espinosa]] (1895-1975): father Augustin and eminent Palencia philologist born in [[Villabasta de Valdavia|Villabasta]], but that spent long seasons in Villamelendro. Specializing in indigenous languages [[Cocama|Kokama]], [[Cocamilla|Kokamilla]] and [[Omagua]] of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], [[Peru]].\n* Mat\u00edas Santos, doctor in Medicine by [[Universidad de Alcal\u00e1]] in 1678.<ref>AHN.

S.XVI]]\n[[File:Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n in Villamelendro de Valdavia 09 Tabernacle.jpg|thumb|Tabernacle with relief of the Resurrection]]\n* [[Church of Our Lady of the Assumption, Villamelendro de Valdavia|Church of Our Lady of the Assumption]]: A work of brick, [[masonry]] and stonework, with a modern tower of [[belfry (architecture)|belfry]] at its feet, which replaced the old tower of masonry and brick, with a hipped roof and two [[loopholes]], which in the middle of the 20th century threatened ruin. Brick doorway of [[semicircular arch]], preceded by a cobbled portico and an arched access doorway to [[sardinel]], on the Epistle side. The interior consists of a single nave, separated by ashlar arches in three bodies covered with [[groin_vault]] and a high wooden choir at the feet. On the side of the presbytery is the main altarpiece from the first half of the 17th century with paintings on the bench of the [[Annunciation]] and [[Adoration]] of the Shepherds, flanked by four small panels representing the [[Fathers of the Church]], from left to right: St [[Augustine of Hippo]], St [[Gregory the Great]], St [[Ambrose of Milan]] and St [[Jerome of Stridon]] on which four columns [[Corinthian Order]] are supported as an allegory for the pillars of the Church. The altarpiece is articulated around a central niche with the image of [[Asunci\u00f3n]] presiding and in the side streets four panels with paintings of the martyrdom of [[Julita y Quirico]], and in the attic Crucifix. [[Tabernacle]] with relief of the [[Resurrection]] on the door. The current work dates mostly from the 16th century, and presented problems from early times. It was necessary to reinforce the building with period buttresses so that they would reinforce the pressures that the groin vaults projected outwards. In the area of the apse it is reinforced with very thick but low buttresses, as in this area the church tends to open up as well. In the cemetery area, the base of these buttresses are eroded by humidity and burials, leaving the building unprotected. That is why in the mid-20th century the arch of the presbytery was reinforced with a double tensor that gave it stability. The second arch of the nave, however, is increasingly giving way inwards, endangering the integrity of the second vault. This is the reason why this building is included in the [[Red List of Heritage]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://listarojapatrimonio.org/ficha/iglesia-nuestra-senora-la-asuncion/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029145310/https://listarojapatrimonio.org/ficha/iglesia-nuestra-senora-la-asuncion/ |archivedate=29 October 2019 }}</ref>of the Association for the care and promotion of Heritage [[Hispania Nostra]] since November 2019.\n\n== History ==\nThe first written mention of this town under the name of \"Uilla Melendi\", along with other neighbouring villages, takes place in 1175 in a manuscript volume belongs to the [[monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Retuerta]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Ant\u00f3n|first=Francisco|publisher=Valladolid : Maxtor, 2005.|title=Monasterios medievales de la provincia de Valladolid|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=dkyqFU1ZNbEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|ref=N\u00famero 19 \u2013 (Crism\u00f3n).

It refers to metrics related to human characteristics .\nBiometrics authentication (or realistic authentication) is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control. It is also used to [[identify]] individuals in groups that are under surveillance.\n\nBiometric identifiers are the distinctive, measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals.Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological versus behavioral characteristics. Physiological characteristics are related to the shape of the body. Examples include, but are not limited to fingerprint, palm veins, facerecognition, DNA, palmprint, hand geometry, iris recognition, retina and odour/scent. Behavioral characteristics are related to the pattern of behavior of a person, including but not limited to typing rhythm, gait, and voice.Some researchers have coined the term behaviometrics to describe the latter class of biometrics.\n\nMore traditional means of access control include token-based identification systems, such as a driver's license or passport, and knowledge-based identification systems, such as a password or personal identification number. Since biometric identifiers are unique to individuals, they are more reliable in verifying identity than token and knowledge-based methods; however, the collection of biometric identifiers raises privacy concerns about the ultimate use of this information.\n\n==Biometric functionality==\nMany different aspects of human physiology, chemistry or behavior can be used for [[Biometrical Journal|biometric]] [[authentication]]. The selection of a particular biometric for use in a specific application involves a weighting of several factors. Jain ''et al.'' (1999)<ref name=Jain2>{{Cite book\n | title = Biometrics: Personal Identification in Networked Society\n | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publications\n | editor-last = Jain\n | editor-first = A.

More specifically, a trait with 'good' permanence will be reasonably invariant over time with respect to the specific matching [[Algorithm|algorithm.]]\n* Measurability (collectability) relates to the ease of acquisition or measurement of the trait. In addition, acquired data should be in a form that permits subsequent processing and extraction of the relevant feature sets. \n* Performance relates to the accuracy, speed, and robustness of technology used (see [[Biometrics#Performance|performance]] section for more details). \n* Acceptability relates to how well individuals in the relevant population accept the technology such that they are willing to have their biometric trait captured and assessed. \n* Circumvention relates to the ease with which a trait might be imitated using an artifact or substitute.\n\nProper biometric use is very application dependent. Certain biometrics will be better than others based on the required levels of convenience and security.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/biometrics-comes-age|title = Biometrics comes of age: despite accuracy and security concerns, biometrics are gaining in popularity|last = Bleicher|first = Paul|date = 2005|journal = Applied Clinical Trials|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 6 December 2019}}</ref> No single biometric will meet all the requirements of every possible application.<ref name=Jain2 />\n\n[[File:Biometric system diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.5]]The block diagram illustrates the two basic modes of a biometric system.<ref name=\"Jain1\">{{Cite book|last=Jain|first=Anil K.|title=Handbook of Biometrics|last2=Ross|first2=Arun|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=978-0-387-71040-2|editor-last=Jain|editor-first=AK|pages=1\u201322|chapter=Introduction to Biometrics|editor2-last=Flynn|editor3-last=Ross|editor3-first=A|chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/book/978-1-4419-4375-0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309042959/http://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/book/978-1-4419-4375-0|archivedate=9 March 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}{{payment required}}</ref> First, in [[Authentication|verification]] (or authentication) mode the system performs a one-to-one comparison of a captured biometric with a specific template stored in a biometric database in order to verify the individual is the person they claim to be.

In the second step, some samples are matched with reference models to generate the genuine and impostor scores and calculate the threshold. The third step is the testing step. This process may use a [[smart card]], username or ID number (e.g. [[Personal identification number|PIN]]) to indicate which template should be used for comparison.<ref group=\"note\">Systems can be designed to use a template stored on media like an [[Biometric passport|e-Passport]] or [[smart card]], rather than a remote database.</ref> 'Positive recognition' is a common use of the verification mode, \"where the aim is to prevent multiple people from using the same identity\".<ref name=Jain1 />\n\nSecond, in identification mode the system performs a one-to-many comparison against a biometric database in an attempt to establish the identity of an unknown individual. The system will succeed in identifying the individual if the comparison of the biometric sample to a template in the [[database]] falls within a previously set threshold. Identification mode can be used either for 'positive recognition' (so that the user does not have to provide any information about the template to be used) or for 'negative recognition' of the person \"where the system establishes whether the person is who she (implicitly or explicitly) denies to be\".<ref name=Jain1 /> The latter function can only be achieved through biometrics since other methods of personal recognition such as [[passwords]], PINs or keys are ineffective.\n\nThe first time an individual uses a biometric system is called ''enrollment''. During enrollment, biometric information from an individual is captured and stored. In subsequent uses, biometric information is detected and compared with the information stored at the time of enrollment. Note that it is crucial that storage and retrieval of such systems themselves be secure if the biometric system is to be robust. The first block (sensor) is the interface between the real world and the system; it has to acquire all the necessary data. Most of the times it is an image acquisition system, but it can change according to the characteristics desired. The second block performs all the necessary pre-processing: it has to remove [[artifact (error)|artifact]]s from the sensor, to enhance the input (e.g. removing background noise), to use some kind of [[normalization (image processing)|normalization]], etc. In the third block, necessary features are extracted. This step is an important step as the correct features need to be extracted in an optimal way. A vector of numbers or an image with particular properties is used to create a ''template''. A template is a synthesis of the relevant characteristics extracted from the source. Elements of the biometric measurement that are not used in the comparison algorithm are discarded in the template to reduce the filesize and to protect the identity of the enrollee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ievoreader.com/how-biometric-data-is-stored/|title=How Biometric Data is Stored|date=2018-12-10|website=ievo Ltd|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> However, depending on the scope of the biometric system, original biometric image sources may be retained such as the PIV-cards used in the Federal Information Processing Standard Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors (FIPS 201).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grother|first=Patrick|last2=Salamon|first2=Wayne|last3=Chandramouli|first3=Ramaswamy|date=July 2013|title=Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification|url=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-76-2.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=NIST SP 800\u201376\u20132|doi=10.6028/nist.sp.800-76-2|via=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the enrollment phase, the template is simply stored somewhere (on a card or within a database or both). During the matching phase, the obtained template is passed to a matcher that compares it with other existing templates, estimating the distance between them using any algorithm (e.g. [[Hamming distance]]). The matching program will analyze the template with the input. This will then be output for a specified use or purpose (e.g. entrance in a restricted area), though it is a fear that the use of biometric data may face mission creep<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/08/09/2018-17079/agency-information-collection-activities-biometric-identity|title=Agency Information Collection Activities: Biometric Identity|date=2018-08-09|website=Federal Register|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Center%20for%20Democracy%20%20Technology%20Comment%20DHS-2019-0001%20%28003%29.pdf|title=Re: DHS 2019-00001, DHS Data Privacy and Integrity Advisory Council|last=Taylor|first=Sandra|date=25 February 2019|website=Department of Homeland Security|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref>.\nSelection of biometrics in any practical application depending upon the characteristic measurements and user requirements.<ref name=Choubisa /> In selecting a particular biometric, factors to consider include, performance, social acceptability, ease of circumvention and/or spoofing, robustness, population coverage, size of equipment needed and [[identity theft]] deterrence.

While unimodal biometric systems are limited by the integrity of their identifier, it is unlikely that several unimodal systems will suffer from identical limitations. Multimodal biometric systems can obtain sets of information from the same marker (i.e., multiple images of an iris, or scans of the same finger) or information from different biometrics (requiring fingerprint scans and, using voice recognition, a spoken passcode).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJqxM8sAJmIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780306822988 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = This is the 'biometric war' Michael Saylor was talking about | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/10/this-is-the-biometric-war-michael.html | date = 3 October 2013 | work = Washington Business Journal | author = Bill Flook | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131007031912/http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/10/this-is-the-biometric-war-michael.html | archivedate = 7 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nMultimodal biometric systems can fuse these unimodal systems sequentially, simultaneously, a combination thereof, or in series, which refer to sequential, parallel, hierarchical and serial integration modes, respectively.\nFusion of the biometrics information can occur at different stages of a recognition system. In case of feature level fusion, the data itself or the features extracted from multiple biometrics are fused. Matching-score level fusion consolidates the scores generated by multiple [[classification rule|classifiers]] pertaining to different modalities. Finally, in case of decision level fusion the final results of multiple classifiers are combined via techniques such as [[majority voting]]. Feature level fusion is believed to be more effective than the other levels of fusion because the feature set contains richer information about the input biometric data than the matching score or the output decision of a classifier. Therefore, fusion at the feature level is expected to provide better recognition results.<ref name=dca />\n\n[[Spoof attack]]s consist in submitting fake biometric traits to biometric systems, and are a major threat that can curtail their security. Multi-modal biometric systems are commonly believed to be intrinsically more robust to spoof attacks, but recent studies<ref>Zahid Akhtar, [http://pralab.diee.unica.it/sites/default/files/Akhtar_PhD2012.pdf \"Security of Multimodal Biometric Systems against Spoof Attacks\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104529/http://pralab.diee.unica.it/sites/default/files/Akhtar_PhD2012.pdf |date=2 April 2015 }}, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy, 6 March 2012.</ref> have shown that they can be evaded by spoofing even a single biometric trait.\n\n==Performance==\nThe following are used as performance metrics for biometric systems:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccert.edu.cn/education/cissp/hism/039-041.html|title=Characteristics of Biometric Systems|publisher=Cernet|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017165633/http://www.ccert.edu.cn/education/cissp/hism/039-041.html|archivedate=17 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* '''False match rate''' (FMR, also called FAR = False Accept Rate): the probability that the system incorrectly matches the input pattern to a non-matching template in the database. It measures the percent of invalid inputs that are incorrectly accepted. In case of similarity scale, if the person is an imposter in reality, but the matching score is higher than the threshold, then he is treated as genuine. This increases the FMR, which thus also depends upon the threshold value.<ref name=Choubisa />\n* '''False non-match rate''' (FNMR, also called FRR = False Reject Rate): the probability that the system fails to detect a match between the input pattern and a matching template in the database. It measures the percent of valid inputs that are incorrectly rejected.\n* '''[[Receiver operating characteristic]]''' or relative operating characteristic (ROC): The ROC plot is a visual characterization of the trade-off between the FMR and the FNMR. In general, the matching algorithm performs a decision based on a threshold that determines how close to a template the input needs to be for it to be considered a match. If the threshold is reduced, there will be fewer false non-matches but more false accepts. Conversely, a higher threshold will reduce the FMR but increase the FNMR. A common variation is the ''Detection error trade-off (DET)'', which is obtained using normal deviation scales on both axes. This more linear graph illuminates the differences for higher performances (rarer errors).\n* '''Equal error rate''' or crossover error rate (EER or CER): the rate at which both acceptance and rejection errors are equal. The value of the EER can be easily obtained from the ROC curve. The EER is a quick way to compare the accuracy of devices with different ROC curves. In general, the device with the lowest EER is the most accurate.\n* '''Failure to enroll rate''' (FTE or FER): the rate at which attempts to create a template from an input is unsuccessful. This is most commonly caused by low-quality inputs.\n* '''Failure to capture rate''' (FTC): Within automatic systems, the probability that the system fails to detect a biometric input when presented correctly.\n* '''Template capacity''': the maximum number of sets of data that can be stored in the system.\n\n==History==\n{{further|Biostatistics}}\n\nAn early cataloguing of fingerprints dates back to 1881 when [[Juan Vucetich]] started a collection of fingerprints of criminals in Argentina.<ref>[http://onin.com/fp/fphistory.html The History of Fingerprints] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312012330/http://onin.com/fp/fphistory.html |date=12 March 2013 }}.</ref> Josh Ellenbogen and Nitzan Lebovic argued that Biometrics originated in the identification systems of criminal activity developed by [[Alphonse Bertillon]] (1853\u20131914) and by [[Francis Galton|Francis Galton's]] theory of fingerprints and physiognomy.<ref>Josh Ellenbogen, ''Reasoned and Unreasoned Images: The Photography of Bertillon, Galton, and Marey'' (University Park, PA, 2012)</ref> According to Lebovic, Galton's work \"led to the application of mathematical models to fingerprints, phrenology, and facial characteristics\", as part of \"absolute identification\" and \"a key to both inclusion and exclusion\" of populations.<ref>Nitzan Lebovic, \"Biometrics or the Power of the Radical Center\", in ''Critical Inquiry'' 41:4 (Summer, 2015), 841\u2013868.</ref> Accordingly, \"the biometric system is the absolute political weapon of our era\" and a form of \"soft control\".<ref>Nitzan Lebovic, \"Biometrics or the Power of the Radical Center\", in ''Critical Inquiry'' 41:4 (Summer, 2015), p. 853.</ref> The theoretician [[David Lyon (sociologist)|David Lyon]] showed that during the past two decades biometric systems have penetrated the civilian market, and blurred the lines between governmental forms of control and private corporate control.<ref>David Lyon, ''Surveillance Society: Monitoring Everyday Life'' (Philadelphia, 2001).</ref> Kelly A.

Rattani, \"Adaptive Biometric System based on Template Update Procedures\", PhD thesis, University of Cagliari, Italy, 2010</ref> The two-fold advantages of these systems are solving the problem of limited training data and tracking the temporal variations of the input data through adaptation. Recently, adaptive biometrics have received a significant attention from the research community. This research direction is expected to gain momentum because of their key promulgated advantages. First, with an adaptive biometric system, one no longer needs to collect a large number of biometric samples during the enrollment process. Second, it is no longer necessary to enrol again or retrain the system from scratch in order to cope with the changing environment. This convenience can significantly reduce the cost of maintaining a biometric system. Despite these advantages, there are several open issues involved with these systems. For mis-classification error (false acceptance) by the biometric system, cause adaptation using impostor sample. However, continuous research efforts are directed to resolve the open issues associated to the field of adaptive biometrics. More information about adaptive biometric systems can be found in the critical review by Rattani ''et al.''\n\n==Recent advances in emerging biometrics==\nIn recent times, biometrics based on brain ([[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]]) and heart ([[Electrocardiography|electrocardiogram]]) signals have emerged.<ref>[R.

The advantage of such 'futuristic' technology is that it is more fraud resistant compared to conventional biometrics like fingerprints. However, such technology is generally more cumbersome and still has issues such as lower accuracy and poor reproducibility over time. \nThis new generation of biometrical systems is called [https://web.archive.org/web/20170404045422/http://hir.harvard.edu/behavioral-profiling-politics-intent/ biometrics of intent] and it aims to scan ''intent''.

Humanitarian efforts are motivated by promoting the welfare of individuals in need, however the use of biometrics as a form of surveillance humanitarianism can create conflict due to varying interests of the groups involved in the particular situation. Disputes over the use of biometrics between aid programs and party officials stalls the distribution of resources to people that need help the most. In July of 2019, the United Nations World Food Program and Houthi Rebels were involved in a large dispute over the use of biometrics to ensure resources are provided to the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Yemen whose lives are threatened. The refusal to cooperate with the interests of the United Nations World Food Program resulted in the suspension of food aid to the Yemen population. The use of biometrics may provide aid programs with valuable information, however its potential solutions may not be best suited for chaotic times of crisis. Conflicts that are caused by deep-rooted political problems, in which the implementation of biometrics may not provide a long-term solution. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/opinion/data-humanitarian-aid.html</ref>\n\n===Human dignity===\nBiometrics have been considered also instrumental to the development of state authority<ref>Breckenridge K.

Reproduced from Le Monde (10 January 2004).</ref> Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] refused to enter the United States in protest at the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator (US-VISIT) program's requirement for visitors to be fingerprinted and photographed. Agamben argued that gathering of biometric data is a form of bio-political tattooing, akin to the tattooing of Jews during the Holocaust. According to Agamben, biometrics turn the human persona into a bare body. Agamben refers to the two words used by Ancient Greeks for indicating \"life\", ''zoe'', which is the life common to animals and humans, just life; and ''bios'', which is life in the human context, with meanings and purposes. Agamben envisages the reduction to bare bodies for the whole humanity.<ref>Agamben G.(1998), ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life''. Trans. Daniel Heller-Roazen. Stanford: Stanford University Press</ref> For him, a new bio-political relationship between citizens and the state is turning citizens into pure biological life (''zoe'') depriving them from their humanity (''bios''); and biometrics would herald this new world.\n\nIn [https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness], [[surveillance]] scholar [[Simone Browne (sociologist)|Simone Browne]] formulates a similar critique as Agamben, citing a recent study<ref name=\"Gao 169\u2013178\">{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221383488|chapter=Face Gender Classification on Consumer Images in a Multiethnic Environment|last=Gao|first=Wei|last2=Ai|first2=Haizhou|pages=169\u2013178|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-01793-3_18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009123149/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221383488_Face_Gender_Classification_on_Consumer_Images_in_a_Multiethnic_Environment|archivedate=9 October 2016|df=dmy-all|title=Advances in Biometrics|volume=5558|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2009|isbn=978-3-642-01792-6}}</ref> relating to biometrics [[Research and development|R&D]] that found that the gender classification system being researched \"is inclined to classify Africans as males and [[Mongoloid]]s as females.\"<ref name=\"Gao 169\u2013178\"/> Consequently, Browne argues that the conception of an objective biometric technology is difficult if such systems are subjectively designed, and are vulnerable to cause errors as described in the study above. The stark expansion of biometric technologies in both the public and private sector magnifies this concern. The increasing [[commodification]] of biometrics by the private sector adds to this danger of loss of human value. Indeed, corporations value the biometric characteristics more than the individuals value them.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=25+Fordham+Intell.+Prop.+Media+%26+Ent.+L.J.+831&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=a4b55d68b2513a0c985a62bb9064501d|title = Biometric Boom: How the private sector Commodifies Human characteristics|last = Walker|first = Elizabeth|date = 2015|journal = Fordham Intellectual Property, Media & Entertainment Law Journal|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170120172630/https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay|archivedate = 20 January 2017|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Browne goes on to suggest that modern society should incorporate a \"biometric consciousness\" that \"entails informed public debate around these technologies and their application, and accountability by the state and the private sector, where the ownership of and access to one's own body data and other intellectual property that is generated from one's body data must be understood as a right.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness|last=Browne|first=Simone|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=116}}</ref>\n\nOther scholars<ref>Mordini, E; Massari, S.

If the item is secured with a biometric device, the damage to the owner could be irreversible, and potentially cost more than the secured property. For example, in 2005, Malaysian car thieves cut off the finger of a [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] owner when attempting to steal the car.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm|title=Malaysia car thieves steal finger|last=Kent|first=Jonathan|date=31 March 2005|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=11 December 2010|location=Kuala Lumpur|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120203534/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm|archivedate=20 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}<br /></ref>\n\n===Presentation attacks===\nIn the context of biometric systems, presentation attacks may also be called \"spoofing attacks\".\n\nAs per the recent ISO/IEC 30107 standard,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/cms/render/live/en/sites/isoorg/contents/data/standard/05/32/53227.html|title=ISO/IEC 30107-1:2016|last=14:00-17:00|website=ISO|language=en|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> presentation attacks are defined as \"presentation to the biometric capture subsystem with the goal of interfering with the operation of the biometric system\". These attacks can be either impersonation or obfuscation attacks. Impersonation attacks try to gain access by pretending to be someone else. Obfuscation attacks may, for example, try to evade [[face detection]] and face recognition systems.\n\nRecently several methods have been proposed to counteract presentation attacks.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014|editor-last=Marcel|editor-first=S\u00e9bastien|editor2-last=Nixon|editor2-first=Mark S.|editor3-last=Li|editor3-first=Stan Z.|title=Handbook of Biometric Anti-Spoofing|journal=Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition|doi=10.1007/978-1-4471-6524-8|issn=2191-6586|isbn=978-1-4471-6523-1}}</ref> Today's sophisticated biometric systems use \"liveness\" elements to detect spoofs (a.k.a. fake images), and some [[Electronic fingerprint recognition|fingerprint scanners]] have pulse detectors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miteksystems.com/blog/looking-ahead-7-reasons-why-biometric-security-is-important-for-digital-identity|title=Looking ahead: 7 reasons why biometric security is important for digital identity {{!}} Mitek|website=www.miteksystems.com|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> Automated detection of a presentation attack is called a \"presentation attack detection\" (PAD).\n\n===Cancelable biometrics===\nOne advantage of passwords over biometrics is that they can be re-issued. If a token or a password is lost or stolen, it can be cancelled and replaced by a newer version. This is not naturally available in biometrics. If someone's face is compromised from a database, they cannot cancel or reissue it. If the electronic biometric identifier is stolen, it is nearly impossible to change a biometric feature. This renders the person's biometric feature questionable for future use in authentication, such as the case with the hacking of security-clearance-related background information from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the United States.\n\nCancelable biometrics is a way in which to incorporate protection and the replacement features into biometrics to create a more secure system. It was first proposed by Ratha ''et al.''<ref>N. K. Ratha, J. H. Connell, and R. M. Bolle, \"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Connell/publication/220353130_Enhancing_Security_and_Privacy_in_Biometrics-Based_Authentication_Systems/links/555a010508ae6fd2d8281b10/Enhancing-Security-and-Privacy-in-Biometrics-Based-Authentication-Systems.pdf Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics-based authentication systems]\", ''IBM Systems Journal'', vol. 40, pp. 614\u2013634, 2001.</ref>\n\n\"Cancelable biometrics refers to the intentional and systematically repeatable distortion of biometric features in order to protect sensitive user-specific data.

The first fingerprint-based cancelable biometric system was designed and developed by Tulyakov ''et al.''<ref>S. Tulyakov, F. Farooq, and V. Govindaraju, \"[https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~tulyakov/papers/tulyakov_ICAPR05_fingerprint_hash.pdf Symmetric Hash Functions for Fingerprint Minutiae]\", ''Proc. Int'l Workshop Pattern Recognition for Crime Prevention, Security, and Surveillance'', pp. 30\u201338, 2005</ref> Essentially, cancelable biometrics perform a distortion of the biometric image or features before matching. The variability in the distortion parameters provides the cancelable nature of the scheme. Some of the proposed techniques operate using their own recognition engines, such as Teoh ''et al.''<ref>A. B. J. Teoh, A. Goh, and D. C. L. Ngo, \"Random Multispace Quantization as an Analytic Mechanism for BioHashing of Biometric and Random Identity Inputs\", ''IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence'', vol. 28, pp. 1892\u20131901, 2006.</ref> and Savvides ''et al.'',<ref>M.

Khosla, \"'Corefaces' \u2013 Robust Shift-Invariant PCA based Correlation Filter for Illumination Tolerant Face Recognition\", presented at IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'04), 2004.</ref> whereas other methods, such as Dabbah ''et al.'',<ref>M. A. Dabbah, W. L. Woo, and S. S. Dlay, \"Secure Authentication for Face Recognition\", presented at Computational Intelligence in Image and Signal Processing, 2007. CIISP 2007.

Although this increases the restrictions on the protection system, it makes the cancellable templates more accessible for available biometric technologies\n\n===Soft biometrics===\n[[Soft biometrics]] traits are physical, behavioral or adhered human characteristics that have been derived from the way human beings normally distinguish their peers (e.g. height, gender, hair color). They are used to complement the identity information provided by the primary biometric identifiers. Although soft biometric characteristics lack the distinctiveness and permanence to recognize an individual uniquely and reliably, and can be easily faked, they provide some evidence about the users identity that could be beneficial. In other words, despite the fact they are unable to individualize a subject, they are effective in distinguishing between people. Combinations of personal attributes like gender, race, eye color, height and other visible identification marks can be used to improve the performance of traditional biometric systems.<ref>Ratha, N.

It refers to metrics related to human characteristics .\nBiometrics authentication (or realistic authentication) is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control. It is also used to [[identify]] individuals in groups that are under [[surveillance]].\n\nBiometric identifiers are the distinctive, measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals.Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological versus behavioral characteristics. Physiological characteristics are related to the shape of the body. Examples include, but are not limited to [[Fingerprint (computing)|fingerprint]], palm veins, [[Facial recognition system|facerecognition]], [[DNA]], [[Palm print|palmprint]], [[hand geometry]], iris recognition, [[retinal scan|retina]] and odour/scent. Behavioral characteristics are related to the pattern of behavior of a person, including but not limited to typing rhythm, gait, and [[speaker recognition|voice]].Some researchers have coined the term behaviometrics to describe the latter class of biometrics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://biosecure.it-sudparis.eu/public_html/biosecure1/public_docs_deli/BioSecure_Deliverable_D10-2-3_b3.pdf |title=Biometrics for Secure Authentication |accessdate=2012-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325163848/http://biosecure.it-sudparis.eu/public_html/biosecure1/public_docs_deli/BioSecure_Deliverable_D10-2-3_b3.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nMore traditional means of access control include token-based identification systems, such as a [[driver's license]] or [[passport]], and knowledge-based identification systems, such as a password or personal identification number. Since biometric identifiers are unique to individuals, they are more reliable in verifying identity than token and knowledge-based methods; however, the collection of biometric identifiers raises privacy concerns about the ultimate use of this information.\n\n==Biometric functionality==\nMany different aspects of human physiology, chemistry or behavior can be used for [[Biometrical Journal|biometric]] [[authentication]]. The selection of a particular biometric for use in a specific application involves a weighting of several factors. Jain ''et al.''

More specifically, a trait with 'good' permanence will be reasonably invariant over time with respect to the specific matching [[Algorithm|algorithm.]]\n* Measurability (collectability) relates to the ease of acquisition or measurement of the trait. In addition, acquired data should be in a form that permits subsequent processing and extraction of the relevant feature sets. \n* Performance relates to the accuracy, speed, and robustness of technology used (see [[Biometrics#Performance|performance]] section for more details). \n* Acceptability relates to how well individuals in the relevant population accept the technology such that they are willing to have their biometric trait captured and assessed. \n* Circumvention relates to the ease with which a trait might be imitated using an artifact or substitute.\n\nProper biometric use is very application dependent. Certain biometrics will be better than others based on the required levels of convenience and security.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/biometrics-comes-age|title = Biometrics comes of age: despite accuracy and security concerns, biometrics are gaining in popularity|last = Bleicher|first = Paul|date = 2005|journal = Applied Clinical Trials|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 6 December 2019}}</ref> No single biometric will meet all the requirements of every possible application.<ref name=Jain2 />\n\n[[File:Biometric system diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.5]]The block diagram illustrates the two basic modes of a biometric system.<ref name=\"Jain1\">{{Cite book|last=Jain|first=Anil K.|title=Handbook of Biometrics|last2=Ross|first2=Arun|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=978-0-387-71040-2|editor-last=Jain|editor-first=AK|pages=1\u201322|chapter=Introduction to Biometrics|editor2-last=Flynn|editor3-last=Ross|editor3-first=A|chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/book/978-1-4419-4375-0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309042959/http://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/book/978-1-4419-4375-0|archivedate=9 March 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}{{payment required}}</ref> First, in [[Authentication|verification]] (or authentication) mode the system performs a one-to-one comparison of a captured biometric with a specific template stored in a biometric database in order to verify the individual is the person they claim to be.

In the second step, some samples are matched with reference models to generate the genuine and impostor scores and calculate the threshold. The third step is the testing step. This process may use a [[smart card]], username or ID number (e.g. [[Personal identification number|PIN]]) to indicate which template should be used for comparison.<ref group=\"note\">Systems can be designed to use a template stored on media like an [[Biometric passport|e-Passport]] or [[smart card]], rather than a remote database.</ref> 'Positive recognition' is a common use of the verification mode, \"where the aim is to prevent multiple people from using the same identity\".<ref name=Jain1 />\n\nSecond, in identification mode the system performs a one-to-many comparison against a biometric database in an attempt to establish the identity of an unknown individual. The system will succeed in identifying the individual if the comparison of the biometric sample to a template in the [[database]] falls within a previously set threshold. Identification mode can be used either for 'positive recognition' (so that the user does not have to provide any information about the template to be used) or for 'negative recognition' of the person \"where the system establishes whether the person is who she (implicitly or explicitly) denies to be\".<ref name=Jain1 /> The latter function can only be achieved through biometrics since other methods of personal recognition such as [[passwords]], PINs or keys are ineffective.\n\nThe first time an individual uses a biometric system is called ''enrollment''. During enrollment, biometric information from an individual is captured and stored. In subsequent uses, biometric information is detected and compared with the information stored at the time of enrollment. Note that it is crucial that storage and retrieval of such systems themselves be secure if the biometric system is to be robust. The first block (sensor) is the interface between the real world and the system; it has to acquire all the necessary data. Most of the times it is an image acquisition system, but it can change according to the characteristics desired. The second block performs all the necessary pre-processing: it has to remove [[artifact (error)|artifact]]s from the sensor, to enhance the input (e.g. removing background noise), to use some kind of [[normalization (image processing)|normalization]], etc. In the third block, necessary features are extracted. This step is an important step as the correct features need to be extracted in an optimal way. A vector of numbers or an image with particular properties is used to create a ''template''. A template is a synthesis of the relevant characteristics extracted from the source. Elements of the biometric measurement that are not used in the comparison algorithm are discarded in the template to reduce the filesize and to protect the identity of the enrollee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ievoreader.com/how-biometric-data-is-stored/|title=How Biometric Data is Stored|date=2018-12-10|website=ievo Ltd|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> However, depending on the scope of the biometric system, original biometric image sources may be retained such as the PIV-cards used in the Federal Information Processing Standard Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors (FIPS 201).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grother|first=Patrick|last2=Salamon|first2=Wayne|last3=Chandramouli|first3=Ramaswamy|date=July 2013|title=Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification|url=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-76-2.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=NIST SP 800\u201376\u20132|doi=10.6028/nist.sp.800-76-2|via=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the enrollment phase, the template is simply stored somewhere (on a card or within a database or both). During the matching phase, the obtained template is passed to a matcher that compares it with other existing templates, estimating the distance between them using any algorithm (e.g. [[Hamming distance]]). The matching program will analyze the template with the input. This will then be output for a specified use or purpose (e.g. entrance in a restricted area), though it is a fear that the use of biometric data may face mission creep<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/08/09/2018-17079/agency-information-collection-activities-biometric-identity|title=Agency Information Collection Activities: Biometric Identity|date=2018-08-09|website=Federal Register|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Center%20for%20Democracy%20%20Technology%20Comment%20DHS-2019-0001%20%28003%29.pdf|title=Re: DHS 2019-00001, DHS Data Privacy and Integrity Advisory Council|last=Taylor|first=Sandra|date=25 February 2019|website=Department of Homeland Security|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref>.\nSelection of biometrics in any practical application depending upon the characteristic measurements and user requirements.<ref name=Choubisa /> In selecting a particular biometric, factors to consider include, performance, social acceptability, ease of circumvention and/or spoofing, robustness, population coverage, size of equipment needed and [[identity theft]] deterrence.

Multimodal biometric systems can obtain sets of information from the same marker (i.e., multiple images of an iris, or scans of the same finger) or information from different biometrics (requiring fingerprint scans and, using voice recognition, a spoken passcode).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJqxM8sAJmIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780306822988 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = This is the 'biometric war' Michael Saylor was talking about | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/10/this-is-the-biometric-war-michael.html | date = 3 October 2013 | work = Washington Business Journal | author = Bill Flook | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131007031912/http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/10/this-is-the-biometric-war-michael.html | archivedate = 7 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nMultimodal biometric systems can fuse these unimodal systems sequentially, simultaneously, a combination thereof, or in series, which refer to sequential, parallel, hierarchical and serial integration modes, respectively.\nFusion of the biometrics information can occur at different stages of a recognition system. In case of feature level fusion, the data itself or the features extracted from multiple biometrics are fused. Matching-score level fusion consolidates the scores generated by multiple [[classification rule|classifiers]] pertaining to different modalities. Finally, in case of decision level fusion the final results of multiple classifiers are combined via techniques such as [[majority voting]]. Feature level fusion is believed to be more effective than the other levels of fusion because the feature set contains richer information about the input biometric data than the matching score or the output decision of a classifier. Therefore, fusion at the feature level is expected to provide better recognition results.<ref name=dca />\n\n[[Spoof attack]]s consist in submitting fake biometric traits to biometric systems, and are a major threat that can curtail their security.

It measures the percent of invalid inputs that are incorrectly accepted. In case of similarity scale, if the person is an imposter in reality, but the matching score is higher than the threshold, then he is treated as genuine. This increases the FMR, which thus also depends upon the threshold value.<ref name=Choubisa />\n* '''False non-match rate''' (FNMR, also called FRR = False Reject Rate): the probability that the system fails to detect a match between the input pattern and a matching template in the database. It measures the percent of valid inputs that are incorrectly rejected.\n* '''[[Receiver operating characteristic]]''' or relative operating characteristic (ROC): The ROC plot is a visual characterization of the trade-off between the FMR and the FNMR. In general, the matching algorithm performs a decision based on a threshold that determines how close to a template the input needs to be for it to be considered a match. If the threshold is reduced, there will be fewer false non-matches but more false accepts. Conversely, a higher threshold will reduce the FMR but increase the FNMR. A common variation is the ''Detection error trade-off (DET)'', which is obtained using normal deviation scales on both axes. This more linear graph illuminates the differences for higher performances (rarer errors).\n* '''Equal error rate''' or crossover error rate (EER or CER): the rate at which both acceptance and rejection errors are equal. The value of the EER can be easily obtained from the ROC curve. The EER is a quick way to compare the accuracy of devices with different ROC curves. In general, the device with the lowest EER is the most accurate.\n* '''Failure to enroll rate''' (FTE or FER): the rate at which attempts to create a template from an input is unsuccessful. This is most commonly caused by low-quality inputs.\n* '''Failure to capture rate''' (FTC): Within automatic systems, the probability that the system fails to detect a biometric input when presented correctly.\n* '''Template capacity''': the maximum number of sets of data that can be stored in the system.\n\n==History==\n{{further|Biostatistics}}\n\nAn early cataloguing of fingerprints dates back to 1881 when [[Juan Vucetich]] started a collection of fingerprints of criminals in Argentina.<ref>[http://onin.com/fp/fphistory.html The History of Fingerprints] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312012330/http://onin.com/fp/fphistory.html |date=12 March 2013 }}.</ref> Josh Ellenbogen and Nitzan Lebovic argued that Biometrics originated in the identification systems of criminal activity developed by [[Alphonse Bertillon]] (1853\u20131914) and by [[Francis Galton|Francis Galton's]] theory of fingerprints and physiognomy.<ref>Josh Ellenbogen, ''Reasoned and Unreasoned Images: The Photography of Bertillon, Galton, and Marey'' (University Park, PA, 2012)</ref> According to Lebovic, Galton's work \"led to the application of mathematical models to fingerprints, phrenology, and facial characteristics\", as part of \"absolute identification\" and \"a key to both inclusion and exclusion\" of populations.<ref>Nitzan Lebovic, \"Biometrics or the Power of the Radical Center\", in ''Critical Inquiry'' 41:4 (Summer, 2015), 841\u2013868.</ref> Accordingly, \"the biometric system is the absolute political weapon of our era\" and a form of \"soft control\".<ref>Nitzan Lebovic, \"Biometrics or the Power of the Radical Center\", in ''Critical Inquiry'' 41:4 (Summer, 2015), p. 853.</ref> The theoretician [[David Lyon (sociologist)|David Lyon]] showed that during the past two decades biometric systems have penetrated the civilian market, and blurred the lines between governmental forms of control and private corporate control.<ref>David Lyon, ''Surveillance Society: Monitoring Everyday Life'' (Philadelphia, 2001).</ref> Kelly A.

Rattani, \"Adaptive Biometric System based on Template Update Procedures\", PhD thesis, University of Cagliari, Italy, 2010</ref> The two-fold advantages of these systems are solving the problem of limited training data and tracking the temporal variations of the input data through adaptation. Recently, adaptive biometrics have received a significant attention from the research community. This research direction is expected to gain momentum because of their key promulgated advantages. First, with an adaptive biometric system, one no longer needs to collect a large number of biometric samples during the enrollment process. Second, it is no longer necessary to enrol again or retrain the system from scratch in order to cope with the changing environment. This convenience can significantly reduce the cost of maintaining a biometric system. Despite these advantages, there are several open issues involved with these systems. For mis-classification error (false acceptance) by the biometric system, cause adaptation using impostor sample. However, continuous research efforts are directed to resolve the open issues associated to the field of adaptive biometrics. More information about adaptive biometric systems can be found in the critical review by Rattani ''et al.''\n\n==Recent advances in emerging biometrics==\nIn recent times, biometrics based on brain ([[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]]) and heart ([[Electrocardiography|electrocardiogram]]) signals have emerged.<ref>[R.

The advantage of such 'futuristic' technology is that it is more fraud resistant compared to conventional biometrics like fingerprints. However, such technology is generally more cumbersome and still has issues such as lower accuracy and poor reproducibility over time. \nThis new generation of biometrical systems is called [https://web.archive.org/web/20170404045422/http://hir.harvard.edu/behavioral-profiling-politics-intent/ biometrics of intent] and it aims to scan ''intent''.

Humanitarian efforts are motivated by promoting the welfare of individuals in need, however the use of biometrics as a form of surveillance humanitarianism can create conflict due to varying interests of the groups involved in the particular situation. Disputes over the use of biometrics between aid programs and party officials stalls the distribution of resources to people that need help the most. In July of 2019, the United Nations World Food Program and Houthi Rebels were involved in a large dispute over the use of biometrics to ensure resources are provided to the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Yemen whose lives are threatened. The refusal to cooperate with the interests of the United Nations World Food Program resulted in the suspension of food aid to the Yemen population. The use of biometrics may provide aid programs with valuable information, however its potential solutions may not be best suited for chaotic times of crisis.

Agamben argued that gathering of biometric data is a form of bio-political tattooing, akin to the tattooing of Jews during the Holocaust. According to Agamben, biometrics turn the human persona into a bare body. Agamben refers to the two words used by Ancient Greeks for indicating \"life\", ''zoe'', which is the life common to animals and humans, just life; and ''bios'', which is life in the human context, with meanings and purposes. Agamben envisages the reduction to bare bodies for the whole humanity.<ref>Agamben G.(1998), ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life''. Trans. Daniel Heller-Roazen. Stanford: Stanford University Press</ref> For him, a new bio-political relationship between citizens and the state is turning citizens into pure biological life (''zoe'') depriving them from their humanity (''bios''); and biometrics would herald this new world.\n\nIn [https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness], [[surveillance]] scholar [[Simone Browne (sociologist)|Simone Browne]] formulates a similar critique as Agamben, citing a recent study<ref name=\"Gao 169\u2013178\">{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221383488|chapter=Face Gender Classification on Consumer Images in a Multiethnic Environment|last=Gao|first=Wei|last2=Ai|first2=Haizhou|pages=169\u2013178|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-01793-3_18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009123149/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221383488_Face_Gender_Classification_on_Consumer_Images_in_a_Multiethnic_Environment|archivedate=9 October 2016|df=dmy-all|title=Advances in Biometrics|volume=5558|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2009|isbn=978-3-642-01792-6}}</ref> relating to biometrics [[Research and development|R&D]] that found that the gender classification system being researched \"is inclined to classify Africans as males and [[Mongoloid]]s as females.\"<ref name=\"Gao 169\u2013178\"/> Consequently, Browne argues that the conception of an objective biometric technology is difficult if such systems are subjectively designed, and are vulnerable to cause errors as described in the study above. The stark expansion of biometric technologies in both the public and private sector magnifies this concern. The increasing [[commodification]] of biometrics by the private sector adds to this danger of loss of human value.

Obfuscation attacks may, for example, try to evade [[face detection]] and face recognition systems.\n\nRecently several methods have been proposed to counteract presentation attacks.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014|editor-last=Marcel|editor-first=S\u00e9bastien|editor2-last=Nixon|editor2-first=Mark S.|editor3-last=Li|editor3-first=Stan Z.|title=Handbook of Biometric Anti-Spoofing|journal=Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition|doi=10.1007/978-1-4471-6524-8|issn=2191-6586|isbn=978-1-4471-6523-1}}</ref> Today's sophisticated biometric systems use \"liveness\" elements to detect spoofs (a.k.a. fake images), and some [[Electronic fingerprint recognition|fingerprint scanners]] have pulse detectors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miteksystems.com/blog/looking-ahead-7-reasons-why-biometric-security-is-important-for-digital-identity|title=Looking ahead: 7 reasons why biometric security is important for digital identity {{!}} Mitek|website=www.miteksystems.com|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> Automated detection of a presentation attack is called a \"presentation attack detection\" (PAD).\n\n===Cancelable biometrics===\nOne advantage of passwords over biometrics is that they can be re-issued. If a token or a password is lost or stolen, it can be cancelled and replaced by a newer version. This is not naturally available in biometrics. If someone's face is compromised from a database, they cannot cancel or reissue it. If the electronic biometric identifier is stolen, it is nearly impossible to change a biometric feature. This renders the person's biometric feature questionable for future use in authentication, such as the case with the hacking of security-clearance-related background information from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the United States.\n\nCancelable biometrics is a way in which to incorporate protection and the replacement features into biometrics to create a more secure system. It was first proposed by Ratha ''et al.''<ref>N. K. Ratha, J. H. Connell, and R. M. Bolle, \"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Connell/publication/220353130_Enhancing_Security_and_Privacy_in_Biometrics-Based_Authentication_Systems/links/555a010508ae6fd2d8281b10/Enhancing-Security-and-Privacy-in-Biometrics-Based-Authentication-Systems.pdf Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics-based authentication systems]\", ''IBM Systems Journal'', vol. 40, pp. 614\u2013634, 2001.</ref>\n\n\"Cancelable biometrics refers to the intentional and systematically repeatable distortion of biometric features in order to protect sensitive user-specific data. If a cancelable feature is compromised, the distortion characteristics are changed, and the same biometrics is mapped to a new template, which is used subsequently. Cancelable biometrics is one of the major categories for biometric template protection purpose besides biometric cryptosystem.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Cancelable biometrics \u2013 Scholarpedia|journal = Scholarpedia|volume = 5|pages = 9201|df = dmy-all|doi = 10.4249/scholarpedia.9201|year = 2010|last1 = Hui|first1 = Lim|last2 = Jin|first2 = Andrew}}</ref> In biometric cryptosystem, \"the error-correcting coding techniques are employed to handle intraclass variations.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feng|first=Y.

The first fingerprint-based cancelable biometric system was designed and developed by Tulyakov ''et al.''<ref>S. Tulyakov, F. Farooq, and V. Govindaraju, \"[https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~tulyakov/papers/tulyakov_ICAPR05_fingerprint_hash.pdf Symmetric Hash Functions for Fingerprint Minutiae]\", ''Proc. Int'l Workshop Pattern Recognition for Crime Prevention, Security, and Surveillance'', pp. 30\u201338, 2005</ref> Essentially, cancelable biometrics perform a distortion of the biometric image or features before matching. The variability in the distortion parameters provides the cancelable nature of the scheme. Some of the proposed techniques operate using their own recognition engines, such as Teoh ''et al.''<ref>A. B. J. Teoh, A. Goh, and D. C. L. Ngo, \"Random Multispace Quantization as an Analytic Mechanism for BioHashing of Biometric and Random Identity Inputs\", ''IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence'', vol. 28, pp. 1892\u20131901, 2006.</ref> and Savvides ''et al.'',<ref>M. Savvides, B. V. K. V. Kumar, and P. K. Khosla, \"'Corefaces' \u2013 Robust Shift-Invariant PCA based Correlation Filter for Illumination Tolerant Face Recognition\", presented at IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'04), 2004.</ref> whereas other methods, such as Dabbah ''et al.'',<ref>M. A. Dabbah, W. L. Woo, and S. S. Dlay, \"Secure Authentication for Face Recognition\", presented at Computational Intelligence in Image and Signal Processing, 2007. CIISP 2007. IEEE Symposium on, 2007.</ref> take the advantage of the advancement of the well-established biometric research for their recognition front-end to conduct recognition. Although this increases the restrictions on the protection system, it makes the cancellable templates more accessible for available biometric technologies\n\n===Soft biometrics===\n[[Soft biometrics]] traits are physical, behavioral or adhered human characteristics that have been derived from the way human beings normally distinguish their peers (e.g. height, gender, hair color). They are used to complement the identity information provided by the primary biometric identifiers. Although soft biometric characteristics lack the distinctiveness and permanence to recognize an individual uniquely and reliably, and can be easily faked, they provide some evidence about the users identity that could be beneficial. In other words, despite the fact they are unable to individualize a subject, they are effective in distinguishing between people. Combinations of personal attributes like gender, race, eye color, height and other visible identification marks can be used to improve the performance of traditional biometric systems.<ref>Ratha, N. K., J. H. Connell, and R. M. Bolle. (2001). \"Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics based authentication systems\". ''IBM Systems Journal'' 40(3): 614\u2013634.</ref> Most soft biometrics can be easily collected and are actually collected during enrollment. Two main ethical issues are raised by soft biometrics.<ref>Mordini E, Ashton H (2012), \"The Transparent Body \u2013 Medical Information, Physical Privacy and Respect for Body Integrity'\".

Magnuson in the National Defense Magazine entitled \"Defense Department Under Pressure to Share Biometric Data\" the United States has bilateral agreements with other nations aimed at sharing biometric data.<ref name=\"DefensePressureShare\">{{Cite journal\n |last1       = Magnuson\n |first1      = S\n |title       = Defense department under pressure to share biometric data.\n |website     = NationalDefenseMagazine.org\n |date        = January 2009\n |url         = http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/ARCHIVE/2009/JANUARY/Pages/DefenseDepartmentUnderPressuretoShareBiometricData.aspx\n |accessdate  = 20 February 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100312215019/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2009/January/Pages/DefenseDepartmentUnderPressuretoShareBiometricData.aspx\n |archivedate = 12 March 2010\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> To quote that article:\n{{cquote|''Miller [a consultant to the Office of Homeland Defense and America's security affairs] said the United States has bilateral agreements to share biometric data with about 25 countries. Every time a foreign leader has visited Washington during the last few years, the State Department has made sure they sign such an agreement.''}}\n\n===Likelihood of full governmental disclosure===\nCertain members of the civilian community are worried about how biometric data is used but full disclosure may not be forthcoming. In particular, the Unclassified Report of the United States' Defense Science Board Task Force on Defense Biometrics states that it is wise to protect, and sometimes even to disguise, the true and total extent of national capabilities in areas related directly to the conduct of security-related activities.<ref name=\"OnDefenseBiometrics\">{{Citation |mode=cs1\n |last        = Defense Science Board (DSB)\n |title       = On Defense Biometrics\n |series      = Unclassified Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force\n |publisher   = Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics\n |date        = March 2007\n |place       = Washington, D.C.\n |chapter-url         = http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/ADA465930.pdf\n |accessdate  = 20 February 2010\n |page        = 84\n |chapter     = Chapter 17 \u00a7Recommendation 45\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110613155549/http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/ADA465930.pdf\n |archivedate = 13 June 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> This also potentially applies to Biometrics.

Indigenous cultures developed here for thousands of years before the arrival of Spaniards in 1532.\n\nIn 2017, the 5,972,606 indigenous people formed about 31.7% of the [[Demographics of Peru|total population of Peru]].<ref name=inei/> At the time of the Spanish arrival, the indigenous peoples of the rain forest of the [[Amazon basin]] to the east of the Andes were mostly [[nomad|semi-nomadic]] tribes; they subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering and migrant agriculture. Those peoples living in the Andes and to the west were dominated by the [[Inca Empire]], who had a complex, hierarchical civilization. It developed many cities, building major temples and monuments with techniques of highly skilled stonemasonry.\n\nMany of the estimated 2000 nations and tribes present in 1500 died out as a consequence of the [[Inca_Empire#Expansion_and_consolidation|expansion and consolidation of the Inca Empire]], especially due to slavery and the genocide of the natives who refused to lose their territories.\n\nWith the arrival of the [[Spaniards]], many natives perished to Eurasian [[infectious disease]]s among the foreigners, to which they had acquired no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. After the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], a large medical campaign was launched, saving the life of thousands of natives and descendants of indigenous and Spanish unions called ''[[mestizo]]s'' (\"mixed race\"), which are nowadays the largest portion of the Peruvian population. \n\nAll of the Peruvian indigenous groups, such as the [[Urarina people|Urarina]],<ref>Dean, Bartholomew.

They have adopted the use of [[firearm]]s and other manufactured items, and trade goods at a remove from mainstream Peruvian society. However, many indigenous groups work to uphold traditional cultural practices and identities.\n\n==Origins==\n{{Further|Ancient Peru|Periodization of pre-Columbian Peru}}\n{{see| Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Qichwa conchucos 01.jpg|thumb|[[Quechua people]] in [[Conchucos District]], Peru]]\n[[Anthropology|Anthropological]] and [[genetics|genetic]] evidence indicates that most of the original population of the Americas descended from migrants from [[North Asia]] ([[Siberia]]) who entered North America across the [[Bering Strait]] in at least three separate waves. DNA analysis has shown that most of those resident in Peru in 1500 were descended from the first wave of Asian migrants, who are theorized, but not proven conclusively, to have crossed [[Beringia]] at the end of the [[last glacial period]] during the [[Upper Paleolithic]], around 24,000 BCE. Migrants from that first wave are thought to have reached Peru in the [[10th millennium BC|10th millennium BCE]], probably entering the Amazon basin from the northwest.\n\nThe [[Norte Chico civilization]] of Peru is the oldest known civilization in the [[Americas]] and one of the [[cradle of civilization|six sites]] where civilization, including the development of agriculture and government, separately originated in the ancient [[world]]. The sites, located {{convert|100|miles}} north of [[Lima]], developed a trade between coastal fisherman and cotton growers and built monumental [[pyramid]]s around the [[30th century BC|30th century BCE]].<ref>Grossman, Ron.

Indigenous cultures developed here for thousands of years before the arrival of Spaniards in 1532.\n\nIn 2017, the 5,972,606 indigenous people formed about 31.7% of the [[Demographics of Peru|total population of Peru]].<ref name=inei/> At the time of the Spanish arrival, the indigenous peoples of the rain forest of the [[Amazon basin]] to the east of the Andes were mostly [[nomad|semi-nomadic]] tribes; they subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering and migrant agriculture. Those peoples living in the Andes and to the west were dominated by the [[Inca Empire]], who had a complex, hierarchical civilization. It developed many cities, building major temples and monuments with techniques of highly skilled stonemasonry.\n\nMany of the estimated 2000 nations and tribes present in 1500 died out as a consequence of the [[Inca_Empire#Expansion_and_consolidation|expansion and consolidation of the Inca Empire]], especially due to slavery and the genocide of the natives who refused to lose their territories.\n\nWith the arrival of the [[Spaniards]], many natives perished to Eurasian [[infectious disease]]s among the foreigners, to which they had acquired no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. After the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], a large medical campaign was launched, saving the life of thousands of natives and descendants of indigenous and Spanish unions called ''[[mestizo]]s'' (\"mixed race\"), which are nowadays the largest portion of the Peruvian population. \n\nAll of the Peruvian indigenous groups, such as the [[Urarina people|Urarina]],<ref>Dean, Bartholomew.

They have adopted the use of [[firearm]]s and other manufactured items, and trade goods at a remove from mainstream Peruvian society. However, many indigenous groups work to uphold traditional cultural practices and identities.\n\n==Origins==\n{{Further|Ancient Peru|Periodization of pre-Columbian Peru}}\n{{see| Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Qichwa conchucos 01.jpg|thumb|[[Quechua people]] in [[Conchucos District]], Peru]]\n[[Anthropology|Anthropological]] and [[genetics|genetic]] evidence indicates that most of the original population of the Americas descended from migrants from [[North Asia]] ([[Siberia]]) who entered North America across the [[Bering Strait]] in at least three separate waves. DNA analysis has shown that most of those resident in Peru in 1500 were descended from the first wave of Asian migrants, who are theorized, but not proven conclusively, to have crossed [[Beringia]] at the end of the [[last glacial period]] during the [[Upper Paleolithic]], around 24,000 BCE. Migrants from that first wave are thought to have reached Peru in the [[10th millennium BC|10th millennium BCE]], probably entering the Amazon basin from the northwest.\n\nThe [[Norte Chico civilization]] of Peru is the oldest known civilization in the [[Americas]] and one of the [[cradle of civilization|six sites]] where civilization, including the development of agriculture and government, separately originated in the ancient [[world]].

{"title_page": "Nauta", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Refimprove|date=August 2013}}\n\n'''Nauta''' is a town in the northeastern part of Loreto Province in the [[Peru]]vian [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]], roughly 100&nbsp;km south [[Iquitos]], the provincial capital. Nauta is located on the north bank of the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River]], a major tributary of the [[Upper Amazon]], a few miles from the confluence of the R\u00edo [[Ucayali]].\n\nEstablished by Manuel [[Pacaya\u2013Samiria]], a leader of the [[Kokama people|Cocama]] peoples, following the 1830 uprising at the [[Jesuit]] mission of Lagunas, Nauta soon became the primary commercial hub of the Peruvian ''selva baja'' (known also as [[Omagua]], or the [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] lowlands).<ref>William Smyth and Frederick Lowe, 1836:204, 258</ref> In 1853, a [[Brazil]]ian owned [[paddle steamer]] made it all the way to Nauta.<ref>Edward Mathews, 1879</ref>\n\nNauta is the primary destination of the only major road leading out of Iquitos, and is a staging area for several ecotourism lodges and ships on the Mara\u00f1\u00f2n River. Boats take passengers from Nauta to the [[Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve]].\n\n== Areas of Interest ==\nNauta is home to many unique features of nature.<ref>''Traveling in Peru: The Amazon Lowlands.'' Peru: Nelles Guide, 2001.</ref> One example is the Sapi Sapi lagoon, where many exotic animals are found, such as the [[Yellow-spotted river turtle]], the [[Arapaima gigas|pirarucu fish]], [[Crocodilia|crocodiles]], and the [[Arrau turtle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/amazon|title=Amazon.|website=World Wild Life|access-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref> For those interested in seeing these animals up close, the option to take a boat around the lagoon is available. According to legend, there was once a mysterious mermaid that attracted locals with her clothing and natural beauty.\n\nAnother attraction is the ''Playa del Amor'', located on the outskirts of Nauta and surrounded by jungle.

Nauta is located on the north bank of the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River]], a major tributary of the [[Upper Amazon]], a few miles from the confluence of the R\u00edo [[Ucayali]].\n\nEstablished by Manuel [[Pacaya\u2013Samiria]], a leader of the [[Cocama]] peoples, following the 1830 uprising at the [[Jesuit]] mission of Lagunas, Nauta soon became the primary commercial hub of the Peruvian ''selva baja'' (known also as [[Omagua]], or the [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] lowlands).<ref>William Smyth and Frederick Lowe, 1836:204, 258</ref> In 1853, a [[Brazil]]ian owned [[paddle steamer]] made it all the way to Nauta.<ref>Edward Mathews, 1879</ref>\n\nNauta is the primary destination of the only major road leading out of Iquitos, and is a staging area for several ecotourism lodges and ships on the Mara\u00f1\u00f2n River. Boats take passengers from Nauta to the [[Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve]].\n\n== Areas of Interest ==\nNauta is home to many unique features of nature.<ref>''Traveling in Peru: The Amazon Lowlands.'' Peru: Nelles Guide, 2001.</ref> One example is the Sapi Sapi lagoon, where many exotic animals are found, such as the [[Yellow-spotted river turtle]], the [[Arapaima gigas|pirarucu fish]], [[Crocodilia|crocodiles]], and the [[Arrau turtle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/amazon|title=Amazon.|website=World Wild Life|access-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref> For those interested in seeing these animals up close, the option to take a boat around the lagoon is available. According to legend, there was once a mysterious mermaid that attracted locals with her clothing and natural beauty.\n\nAnother attraction is the ''Playa del Amor'', located on the outskirts of Nauta and surrounded by jungle.
