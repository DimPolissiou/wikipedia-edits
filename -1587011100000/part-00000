The screenplay concerns a man who leaves his middle class job to run a hotel left to him by his great uncle.\n\n==Plot==\nJohnny Baxter is at his corporate job when a [[probate]] attorney tells him that his recently deceased uncle, Jacob Barnesworth, has left him sole ownership of the lucrative Grand Imperial Hotel in the fictional town of Silver Hill, [[Colorado]]. Barnesworth claimed that the hotel brings in more than $14,000 per month. Baxter views this as a golden opportunity and quits his job. He moves his family to Colorado to take [[proprietorship]] of the hotel. It is an immense but ramshackle building with no heat and a colorful old codger, Jesse McCord, living in the shed. McCord offers his services as a bartender, but Baxter assigns him the job of bellhop. Local [[mechanic|grease monkey]] Wally Perkins explains that the Grand Imperial sits on a huge amount of property. Baxter realizes that they can turn the hotel into a [[ski resort]].\n\nBaxter attempts to secure funding for his plans. Local banker Martin Ridgeway expresses great interest in Baxter's idea, but also offers to buy the lodge, supposedly in order to convert it into a boys' school. Baxter declines, so Ridgeway declines to give Baxter a loan, citing him as a bad collateral risk and specifically pointing out that Baxter has no experience in hotel or restaurant management. Baxter meets with a friendly banker, Mr. Wainwright, at a ski lodge. Baxter claims to be an avid skier and Wainwright takes him to a [[Alpine skiing#Ski trail ratings|black diamond]] run called \"Nightmare Alley.\" Baxter ends up crashing into a tree.\n\nWhile Baxter is recovering, Ridgeway gives him a check for $3,000. Baxter starts making a list of repairs for the lodge. Meanwhile, Wally works with McCord to repair the hot water heater. The water heater explodes, tearing a hole in the kitchen wall. Ridgeway's check covers the repair, but leaves nothing for the ski lift Baxter had in mind. McCord pulls an old [[Steam donkey|donkey engine]] out of mothballs, tying a rope around it, and offers it as a makeshift ski lift. When Wally dynamites a tree stump from the ground, the explosion sets off an avalanche, blocking a passing train carrying several hundred skiers. The Baxters quickly shuttle the skiers to their resort.\n\nAll goes well until Wally loses his balance and skis down a steep mountain, dangling over a ledge. Using the donkey engine and a rope to lower Baxter down the mountain to rescue Wally, McCord accidentally cause the donkey engine to slide down the mountain and plow through the hotel. All of the guests check out, leaving the Baxters out of money once again.\n\nBaxter goes back to Ridgeway, asking for an extension on his loan, which Ridgeway refuses. Baxter notices a sign for the Silver Hills [[Snowmobile#Types of races|Snowmobile]] Race, with a $5,000 prize. Baxter decides to drive in the race, with McCord as his partner. Baxter's wife threatens to leave him over his carelessness and obsession. Though they come close, Baxter and McCord narrowly lose the race. \n\nRidgeway brings the deed transfer papers to the lodge for Baxter to sign. After threatening to begin the foreclosure process, he offers to buy the resort from Baxter. Ridgeway's secretary, Miss Wigginton, tells everyone the truth: the property includes several hundred acres of timberland originally donated to the local Indian tribes by Barnesworth for as long as the tribe inhabited the land. As the tribe has moved away or died out, the land reverts to the estate. Ridgeway wants to buy the resort in order to [[logging|log]] the timber. McCord adds that the land the town was built on was granted by Barnesworth on the condition that several buildings be erected, including a library. Baxter's son notes that he has not seen a library, and asks why the land has not reverted to Baxter. Silver Hill is in violation of the grant, meaning that the entire town is built on land now owned by Baxter. Ridgeway agrees to loan Baxter the money necessary to repair and expand the resort.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as Johnny Baxter\n* [[Nancy Olson]] as Sue Baxter\n* [[Harry Morgan]] as Jesse McCord\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Martin Ridgeway\n* [[Johnny Whitaker]] as Richard Baxter\n* [[Michael McGreevey]] as Wally Perkins\n* [[George Lindsey]] as Double L.

The screenplay concerns a man who leaves his middle class job to run a hotel left to him by his great uncle.\n\n==Plot==\nJohnny Baxter is at his corporate job when a [[probate]] attorney tells him that his recently deceased uncle, Jacob Barnesworth, has left him sole ownership of the lucrative Grand Imperial Hotel in the fictional town of Silver Hill, [[Colorado]]. Barnesworth claimed that the hotel brings in more than $14,000 per month. Baxter views this as a golden opportunity and quits his job. He moves his family to Colorado to take [[proprietorship]] of the hotel. It is an immense but ramshackle building with no heat and a colorful old codger, Jesse McCord, living in the shed. McCord offers his services as a bartender, but Baxter assigns him the job of bellhop. Local [[mechanic|grease monkey]] Wally Perkins explains that the Grand Imperial sits on a huge amount of property. Baxter realizes that they can turn the hotel into a [[ski resort]].\n\nBaxter attempts to secure funding for his plans. Local banker Martin Ridgeway expresses great interest in Baxter's idea, but also offers to buy the lodge, supposedly in order to convert it into a boys' school. Baxter declines, so Ridgeway declines to give Baxter a loan, citing him as a bad collateral risk and specifically pointing out that Baxter has no experience in hotel or restaurant management. Baxter meets with a friendly banker, Mr. Wainwright, at a ski lodge. Baxter claims to be an avid skier and Wainwright takes him to a [[Alpine skiing#Ski trail ratings|black diamond]] run called \"Nightmare Alley.\" Baxter ends up crashing into a tree.\n\nWhile Baxter is recovering, Ridgeway gives him a check for $3,000. Baxter starts making a list of repairs for the lodge. Meanwhile, Wally works with McCord to repair the hot water heater. The water heater explodes, tearing a hole in the kitchen wall. Ridgeway's check covers the repair, but leaves nothing for the ski lift Baxter had in mind. McCord pulls an old [[Steam donkey|donkey engine]] out of mothballs, tying a rope around it, and offers it as a makeshift ski lift. When Wally dynamites a tree stump from the ground, the explosion sets off an avalanche, blocking a passing train carrying several hundred skiers. The Baxters quickly shuttle the skiers to their resort.\n\nAll goes well until Wally loses his balance and skis down a steep mountain, dangling over a ledge. Using the donkey engine and a rope to lower Baxter down the mountain to rescue Wally, McCord accidentally cause the donkey engine to slide down the mountain and plow through the hotel. All of the guests check out, leaving the Baxters out of money once again.\n\nBaxter goes back to Ridgeway, asking for an extension on his loan, which Ridgeway refuses. Baxter notices a sign for the Silver Hills Snowmobile Race, with a $5,000 prize. Baxter decides to drive in the race, with McCord as his partner.

Fish argued that independence could \"shake up British politics\" to ensure a more \"fair distribution of wealth\" throughout the UK. However, he declined to actively campaign in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] because he believed it would be \"hypocritical\" as he was planning to leave Scotland for Germany to live

They achieved further chart success in the UK, attaining top ten hit singles in 1985 with \"[[Kayleigh]]\" and \"[[Lavender (Marillion song)|Lavender]]\", and again in 1987 with \"[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]\". In 1988, Fish left Marillion to pursue a solo career.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Lyrics from the song \"[[Kayleigh]]\" were etched into paving stones in Market Square in [[Galashiels]] in 2012; the lines \u2018stilettoes in the snow\u2019, and \u2018moon-washed college halls\u2019 were inspired by Fish\u2019s girlfriend of the time who was at the Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels in the 1980s.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Solo career==\nMany of Fish's later works contain lengthy [[spoken word]] lyrics, shorter examples of which can be heard on earlier Marillion albums. Fish has collaborated with [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] founder [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] on his ''[[Still (Tony Banks album)|Still]]'' and ''[[Soundtracks (Tony Banks album)|Soundtracks]]'' albums, singing on the tracks \"Shortcut to Somewhere\", \"Angel Face\" and \"Another Murder of a Day\", co-writing the latter.\n\nFish appeared at World Bowl XI, 14 June 2003, Hampden Park, Glasgow. His performance included a rousing rendition of \"Caledonia\" before kick-off.\n\nOn 26 August 2007, Fish performed at the 'Hobble on The Cobbles' show at the Market Square in [[Aylesbury]]. He was accompanied on stage by his four former Marillion bandmates from the classic line-up ([[Mark Kelly (keyboardist)|Mark Kelly]], [[Steve Rothery]], [[Ian Mosley]] and [[Pete Trewavas]]) for one song: '[[Market Square Heroes]]'. This was the first time they had performed together in nearly two decades.

The studio recorded ''In Amber'' by [[Dream Disciples]] (1994) and ''Man Dancin'' by [[Tam White]] in (1996). He released a number of \"official [[bootleg recording|bootleg]]\" albums to finance the company before selling it to [[Roadrunner Records]].

Fish argued that independence could \"shake up British politics\" to ensure a more \"fair distribution of wealth\" throughout the UK. However, he declined to actively campaign in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] because he believed it would be \"hypocritical\" as he was planning to leave Scotland for Germany to live

Denise, the wife of the proprietor, tends to her chores while singing \"Chanson\": first in French, then English. She sees the same faces every day, but sometimes, things can happen that change you, making life different and new.\n\nFocus is shifted to the customers at the tables. Bits of conversation are heard: complaints from a gardener whose neighbor's tree is shading his spinach; an argument between the local priest and the school teacher who has been teaching that Joan of Arc \"thought\" she heard voices; the owner of a well quarrelling with the neighbor whose dog had breached that well seven years previously. The bickering villagers insist to one another that their lives would be much better \"If It Wasn't for You\". All are anticipating the arrival of the baker: the village has been without bread since the previous baker died, and tensions are running higher than normal.\n\nThe Marquis enters with his three \"nieces\" and welcomes the new baker, Aimable Castagnet. Accurately named, he is a jolly, middle-aged fellow. With him is his young and beautiful wife Genevi\u00e8ve, whom the Marquis mistakes for the baker's daughter. The error is quickly addressed, but does not go unremarked by the townspeople. With Pompom, their cat, the couple is shown to their new home\u2014with comments from the townsfolk, about the baker robbing the cradle, following in their wake.\n\nIn their new bakery, Aimable is clearly pleased with his new shop. To Genevi\u00e8ve, he sings \"Merci, Madame\", as enchanted with her as he is with his new surroundings. He is excited about the prospects of a prosperous life with a family. The villagers, too, are pleased with the return of \"Bread\" to the small town.\n\nThe customers argue about their place in line in the small shop, eager to sample the wares of the new baker.  Others gossip about the Marquis and his nieces; and Antoine, one of the villagers, asks Aimable how an old man like him was able to snare the beautiful Genevi\u00e8ve. \"God was good to me,\" he replies, and Genevi\u00e8ve reminds the villagers that not only did her husband choose her, she chose him, too\u2014and, she insists, she couldn't be happier.  She smiles at the customers but, embarrassed by their prying, rushes inside in tears.  She sings of the \"Gifts of Love\" she's received from men in her past: her passionate affair with a married man named Paul, and her gentler feelings for Aimable. Closing the door on her past, she resolves to be a good wife to the baker.\n\nWhile picking up the Marquis' pastry order, his driver, Dominique, eyes Genevi\u00e8ve, mistaking her for the baker's daughter, just as the Marquis himself did earlier. Genevi\u00e8ve corrects the handsome chauffeur, but he cockily insists on addressing her as Mademoiselle. Genevi\u00e8ve insists, \"Madame!\", but he continues flirting with her, flustering her. Aimable returns after trying to find Pompom and reports that the cat has run off.\n\nSome time later in the village square, Dominique again advances upon Genevi\u00e8ve. She rebuffs him, reminding him that she is happily married, but he resolves that he will be with his \"Proud Lady\".\n\nThe villagers gather again outside the caf\u00e9, engaged in their usual squabbles. The baker and his wife arrive and sit at a table near Antoine who continues to tease them about the difference in their ages. He implies that while the baker may be able to create the perfect croissant, his ability to create a child might have passed. Dominique comes to the couple's defense, hitting Antoine, but Genevieve is humiliated by the entire scene and exits in a huff. The men of the village slyly advise one another to \"Look For the Woman\" whenever conflict arises among them: \"It's when the hen walks into the barnyard that the roosters start pecking at each other.\"\n\nThat evening, we see three couples \u2014 including the baker and his wife \u2014 getting ready for bed. Dominique and his guitar-toting friend Philippe plot their evening in the town square, and as the three couples end their reprise of \"Chanson\", Dominique and Philippe start their \"Serenade\". The baker believes their song is a tribute offered in thanks for his baking, but Genevi\u00e8ve understands correctly that Dominique is singing to her. Aimable, ever the good man, sends Genevi\u00e8ve to give Dominique some unsold baguettes.  She castigates her insistent suitor, but Dominique is undeterred. Despite her protests, Genevi\u00e8ve is unable to resist him, and they decide to meet an hour later and run off together.\n\nAimable calls down to Genevi\u00e8ve, and she replies that she'll return to bed in a minute. As he drops off to sleep, she contemplates her situation, singing the legend of the \"Meadowlark\". In the story, the bird decides to stay with the old king who adored her\u2014and perishes of sadness, having missed her opportunity to fly away with the sun-god who had wooed her. Resisting the meadowlark's sad fate, Genevi\u00e8ve embarks for an unknown future with her \"beautiful young man\".\n\nThe neighbors are awakened to a fire in the bakery's oven, where the baker finds charred loaves. Usually Genevi\u00e8ve is the early riser of the household, and he begins to search for her, believing that she has gone in search for Pompom. A crowd begins to gather and the gossip begins at once, \"Buzz A-Buzz\": they know Aimable's search will yield neither cat nor wife.\n\nThe Marquis arrives and takes the baker aside, telling him that Genevi\u00e8ve had run off with his chauffeur in the Marquis' Peugeot. Philippe arrives and confirms the story, but Aimable chooses to believe that Genevi\u00e8ve has merely gone to visit her mother. As the gossip continues, the Marquis threatens to report his stolen car to the police, and to have the two lovers arrested. The gossiping townsfolk gleefully agree that the whole outrageous scandal is the \"best thing to happen in this town in all my life!\"\n\n===Act Two===\nThe second act opens as the first, with Denise reprising her \"Chanson\". The villagers reprise \"If It Wasn't for You\", while keeping an eye on the baker: they are relieved to see him begin a new batch of dough. The teacher and the priest argue again, the priest accusing the villagers of contaminating Genevieve with their immoral conduct, the teacher championing free will. The Marquis dismisses both explanations, insisting that Genevieve's behavior was simple human nature\u2014that we are all captive to the joys of the flesh.\n\nAimable crosses to the caf\u00e9 to inform the customers that the bread will be ready momentarily. The typically sober baker orders a cognac, and another, and sings tipsily that Genevieve will be home on an \"Any-Day-Now Day\": she has just gone to visit her mother. In an attempt to sober him up, the villagers follow him into the bakery, only to find it in a shambles. Aimable collapses amongst the spilled flour, dough hanging from the ceiling, and burnt loaves of bread.\n\nThe villagers realize that the town is in danger of being once again without a baker, and they blame the despondent baker's runaway wife for the sorry state of affairs. In the closed bakery, they try to cheer up Aimable and get him baking again by telling him that he's the \"Luckiest Man in the World\": he's been spared the boredom and arguments of married life.\n\nThe Marquis enters, telling Aimable that all he needs to cheer up is some \"Feminine Companionship,\" even offering to loan his \"nieces\". The villagers ask the Marquis if the girls are really his nieces, to which he responds, \"What is a niece but the daughter of a brother, and as I consider all men my brothers....\" The girls surround the baker, flirting and caressing him. The priest enters and, shocked at the scene, begins feuding with the Marquis.  The villagers join in the fray, and the baker throws them all out.\n\nAt a town meeting in the church, Aimable admits that he knows that Genevi\u00e8ve has run off. He offers the Marquis his life savings to deter him from hunting down the couple. He leaves the church, and the villagers\u2014chastened by the aging man's selflessness even in the face of profound anguish\u2014vow to work together to find Genevi\u00e8ve and persuade her to return to her husband.\n\nAlone in the bakery, Aimable decides \"If I Have to Live Alone\", that he will do so with dignity.\n\nThe villagers are again at the cafe, and Antoine enters claiming that he has found the young couple at a hotel in a nearby town.  They agree to form a search party, and the Marquis, the priest, and the teacher go after the outcasts to persuade the baker's wife to return home. Left behind, the women of the town comment ruefully on the \"Romance\" that is missing from their own lives.\n\nIn a small hotel room, Genevi\u00e8ve and Dominique are together, but all is not well. She admits her passion for the young man, but wonders \"Where Is the Warmth?\" She gathers her things and leaves him asleep.\n\nAt a bus stop, the villagers encounter Genevi\u00e8ve on her way to [[Marseille]]. They beg her to return but, guilt-stricken and ashamed, she tells them that she can never go home again. They eventually convince her to return: \"all sins are forgivable\".\n\nThe villagers are asked to remain in their houses so as to not embarrass Genevi\u00e8ve when she arrives. Escorted by the priest and the Marquis, Genevi\u00e8ve walks through the empty street to the bakery and cautiously approaches her door.\n\nShe finds Aimable and attempts to tell him the truth, but he awkwardly refuses to listen, offering her dinner and insisting that she has returned from visiting her mother. Pompom arrives at the window, and Aimable angrily chastises the cat for running after \"some tom that looked good in the moonlight.\" He unleashes all of his pent-up bitterness toward Genevi\u00e8ve on the small cat, but offers it a saucer of milk. He has faithfully refilled the milk each day, and when Aimable charges that the cat will run off yet again, a tearful Genevi\u00e8ve assures him that \"she will not leave\". Reconciled, the two begin to prepare the bread for the next day.\n\nDenise begins the new day at the caf\u00e9, reprising her \"Chanson\", joined by the town in harmony.\n\n==Songs==\nThis song list reflects the recording of the 1990 London production.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"Chanson\" \u2013 Denise\n* \"If It Wasn't for You\" \u2013 Teacher, Priest, Marquis, and Villagers\n* \"Merci, Madame\" \u2013 Aimable and Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Bread \u2013 Villagers\n* \"Gifts of Love\" \u2013 Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Plain and Simple\" \u2013 Aimable and Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Proud Lady\" \u2013 Dominique\n* \"Look for the Woman\" \u2013 Teacher, Marquis, Claude, Barnab\u00e9, Antoine, Casimir, Pierre, Doumergue\n* \"Chanson (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise\n* \"Serenade\" \u2013 Dominique, Philippe, Aimable, and Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"[[Meadowlark (song)|Meadowlark]]\" \u2013 Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Buzz A-Buzz\" \u2013 Aimable, Marquis, Philippe, Villagers\n{{col-break}}\n;Act II\n* \"Chanson (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise\n* \"If It Wasn't for You\" \u2013 Priest, Teacher, Marquis, and Villagers\n* \"Any-Day-Now Day\" \u2013 Aimable, Villagers\n* \"Endless Delights\" \u2013 Dominique, Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Luckiest Man in the World\" \u2013 Claude, Village Men, Marquis, Simone, In\u00e8s, Nicole\n* \"Feminine Companionship\" \u2013 Claude, Village Men, Marquis, Simone, In\u00e8s, Nicole\n* \"If I Have to Live Alone\" \u2013 Aimable\n* \"Romance\" \u2013 Denise, Hortense, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Simone, Inez, Nicole\n* \"Where is the Warmth?\" \u2013 Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Gifts of Love (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise, Aimable, Genevi\u00e8ve, Villagers\n* \"Chanson (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise, Aimable, Genevi\u00e8ve, Villagers\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Cast recordings==\nAlthough bootleg live recordings are known to exist, a full cast album of ''The Baker's Wife'' was never recorded at the time of its original tour in 1976. While the show was playing in Boston, it was seen by long-time theatre enthusiasts Bruce and Doris Yeko, who had only recently started up their own record label, [[Original Cast (record label)|''Take Home Tunes'']], devoted to the preservation of musical scores that might not otherwise be recorded.  Impressed by the score, the Yekos contacted Stephen Schwartz, who suggested to them that a full cast album might be recorded.<ref>Carol de Giere, ''Defying Gravity'', pp. 138-39.</ref> At that time, however, the couple had little experience in record production, having only released an EP of songs from ''[[The Robber Bridegroom (musical)|The Robber Bridegroom]]''. However, after ''The Baker's Wife'' closed on the road, the Yekos and Schwartz negotiated to record an LP of excerpts from the score, with the composer himself selecting what he considered to be the best songs (rather than those, necessarily, that might advance the plot).\n\nThe recording sessions took place in early 1977 in an apartment studio in Greenwich Village that was too small to accommodate an ensemble. As a result, Schwartz suggested that, to save both space and money, only the songs performed by the three protagonists would be recorded. Thus the resulting LP contained six solo numbers and five duets, performed by original cast members Paul Sorvino and Patti LuPone, along with Terri Ralston (who sang \"Chanson\").\n\nAt the same time, the Yekos produced and released an EP with additional songs performed by original cast member Sorvino along with [[Darlene Conley]], [[Denise Lor]], and [[Portia Nelson]] (who were not in the touring production) and composer/lyricist Stephen Schwartz and his wife, Carol.\n\nThis \"original cast\" LP of ''The Baker's Wife'' became very popular. It has since been re-released on CD twice: once in 1989 (the first CD to be released by Bruce Yeko's Original Cast label) and again in 1992.\n\nThe 1990 London production, directed by Trevor Nunn, was recorded and released on the JAY label as a lavish two-CD set.  This comprised 20 songs, of which 10 had been previously heard on the 1976 LP and one other from the studio cast EP. The remaining songs, not previously recorded, either came from the original tour, the 1985 off-Broadway revival, or had been specially written for the new London production.\n\nSince the late 1980s, songs from the show have also been recorded by solo artists. \"Meadowlark\" is by far the most frequently covered song, having been recorded by [[Sarah Brightman]], [[Betty Buckley]], [[Susan Egan]], [[Liz Callaway]], [[Sandy Campbell (singer)|Sandy Campbell]], [[Meredith Braun]], [[Dianne Pilkington]], [[Judy Kuhn]], [[Roslyn Kind]], [[Susannah Mars]] and others.\n\n==References==\n*De Giere, Carol.

Nearly a decade later [[Zero Mostel]] was named to take the lead.\n\nBy 1976 the rights had devolved to producer [[David Merrick]].

Denise, the wife of the proprietor, tends to her chores while singing \"Chanson\": first in French, then English. She sees the same faces every day, but sometimes, things can happen that change you, making life different and new.\n\nFocus is shifted to the customers at the tables. Bits of conversation are heard: complaints from a gardener whose neighbor's tree is shading his spinach; an argument between the local priest and the school teacher who has been teaching that Joan of Arc \"thought\" she heard voices; the owner of a well quarrelling with the neighbor whose dog had breached that well seven years previously. The bickering villagers insist to one another that their lives would be much better \"If It Wasn't for You\". All are anticipating the arrival of the baker: the village has been without bread since the previous baker died, and tensions are running higher than normal.\n\nThe Marquis enters with his three \"nieces\" and welcomes the new baker, Aimable Castagnet. Accurately named, he is a jolly, middle-aged fellow. With him is his young and beautiful wife Genevi\u00e8ve, whom the Marquis mistakes for the baker's daughter. The error is quickly addressed, but does not go unremarked by the townspeople. With Pompom, their cat, the couple is shown to their new home\u2014with comments from the townsfolk, about the baker robbing the cradle, following in their wake.\n\nIn their new bakery, Aimable is clearly pleased with his new shop. To Genevi\u00e8ve, he sings \"Merci, Madame\", as enchanted with her as he is with his new surroundings. He is excited about the prospects of a prosperous life with a family. The villagers, too, are pleased with the return of \"Bread\" to the small town.\n\nThe customers argue about their place in line in the small shop, eager to sample the wares of the new baker.  Others gossip about the Marquis and his nieces; and Antoine, one of the villagers, asks Aimable how an old man like him was able to snare the beautiful Genevi\u00e8ve. \"God was good to me,\" he replies, and Genevi\u00e8ve reminds the villagers that not only did her husband choose her, she chose him, too\u2014and, she insists, she couldn't be happier.  She smiles at the customers but, embarrassed by their prying, rushes inside in tears.  She sings of the \"Gifts of Love\" she's received from men in her past: her passionate affair with a married man named Paul, and her gentler feelings for Aimable. Closing the door on her past, she resolves to be a good wife to the baker.\n\nWhile picking up the Marquis' pastry order, his driver, Dominique, eyes Genevi\u00e8ve, mistaking her for the baker's daughter, just as the Marquis himself did earlier. Genevi\u00e8ve corrects the handsome chauffeur, but he cockily insists on addressing her as Mademoiselle. Genevi\u00e8ve insists, \"Madame!\", but he continues flirting with her, flustering her. Aimable returns after trying to find Pompom and reports that the cat has run off.\n\nSome time later in the village square, Dominique again advances upon Genevi\u00e8ve. She rebuffs him, reminding him that she is happily married, but he resolves that he will be with his \"Proud Lady\".\n\nThe villagers gather again outside the caf\u00e9, engaged in their usual squabbles. The baker and his wife arrive and sit at a table near Antoine who continues to tease them about the difference in their ages. He implies that while the baker may be able to create the perfect croissant, his ability to create a child might have passed. Dominique comes to the couple's defense, hitting Antoine, but Genevieve is humiliated by the entire scene and exits in a huff. The men of the village slyly advise one another to \"Look For the Woman\" whenever conflict arises among them: \"It's when the hen walks into the barnyard that the roosters start pecking at each other.\"\n\nThat evening, we see three couples \u2014 including the baker and his wife \u2014 getting ready for bed. Dominique and his guitar-toting friend Philippe plot their evening in the town square, and as the three couples end their reprise of \"Chanson\", Dominique and Philippe start their \"Serenade\". The baker believes their song is a tribute offered in thanks for his baking, but Genevi\u00e8ve understands correctly that Dominique is singing to her. Aimable, ever the good man, sends Genevi\u00e8ve to give Dominique some unsold baguettes.  She castigates her insistent suitor, but Dominique is undeterred. Despite her protests, Genevi\u00e8ve is unable to resist him, and they decide to meet an hour later and run off together.\n\nAimable calls down to Genevi\u00e8ve, and she replies that she'll return to bed in a minute. As he drops off to sleep, she contemplates her situation, singing the legend of the \"Meadowlark\". In the story, the bird decides to stay with the old king who adored her\u2014and perishes of sadness, having missed her opportunity to fly away with the sun-god who had wooed her. Resisting the meadowlark's sad fate, Genevi\u00e8ve embarks for an unknown future with her \"beautiful young man\".\n\nThe neighbors are awakened to a fire in the bakery's oven, where the baker finds charred loaves. Usually Genevi\u00e8ve is the early riser of the household, and he begins to search for her, believing that she has gone in search for Pompom. A crowd begins to gather and the gossip begins at once, \"Buzz A-Buzz\": they know Aimable's search will yield neither cat nor wife.\n\nThe Marquis arrives and takes the baker aside, telling him that Genevi\u00e8ve had run off with his chauffeur in the Marquis' Peugeot. Philippe arrives and confirms the story, but Aimable chooses to believe that Genevi\u00e8ve has merely gone to visit her mother. As the gossip continues, the Marquis threatens to report his stolen car to the police, and to have the two lovers arrested. The gossiping townsfolk gleefully agree that the whole outrageous scandal is the \"best thing to happen in this town in all my life!\"\n\n===Act Two===\nThe second act opens as the first, with Denise reprising her \"Chanson\". The villagers reprise \"If It Wasn't for You\", while keeping an eye on the baker: they are relieved to see him begin a new batch of dough. The teacher and the priest argue again, the priest accusing the villagers of contaminating Genevieve with their immoral conduct, the teacher championing free will. The Marquis dismisses both explanations, insisting that Genevieve's behavior was simple human nature\u2014that we are all captive to the joys of the flesh.\n\nAimable crosses to the caf\u00e9 to inform the customers that the bread will be ready momentarily. The typically sober baker orders a cognac, and another, and sings tipsily that Genevieve will be home on an \"Any-Day-Now Day\": she has just gone to visit her mother. In an attempt to sober him up, the villagers follow him into the bakery, only to find it in a shambles. Aimable collapses amongst the spilled flour, dough hanging from the ceiling, and burnt loaves of bread.\n\nThe villagers realize that the town is in danger of being once again without a baker, and they blame the despondent baker's runaway wife for the sorry state of affairs. In the closed bakery, they try to cheer up Aimable and get him baking again by telling him that he's the \"Luckiest Man in the World\": he's been spared the boredom and arguments of married life.\n\nThe Marquis enters, telling Aimable that all he needs to cheer up is some \"Feminine Companionship,\" even offering to loan his \"nieces\". The villagers ask the Marquis if the girls are really his nieces, to which he responds, \"What is a niece but the daughter of a brother, and as I consider all men my brothers....\" The girls surround the baker, flirting and caressing him. The priest enters and, shocked at the scene, begins feuding with the Marquis.  The villagers join in the fray, and the baker throws them all out.\n\nAt a town meeting in the church, Aimable admits that he knows that Genevi\u00e8ve has run off. He offers the Marquis his life savings to deter him from hunting down the couple. He leaves the church, and the villagers\u2014chastened by the aging man's selflessness even in the face of profound anguish\u2014vow to work together to find Genevi\u00e8ve and persuade her to return to her husband.\n\nAlone in the bakery, Aimable decides \"If I Have to Live Alone\", that he will do so with dignity.\n\nThe villagers are again at the cafe, and Antoine enters claiming that he has found the young couple at a hotel in a nearby town.  They agree to form a search party, and the Marquis, the priest, and the teacher go after the outcasts to persuade the baker's wife to return home. Left behind, the women of the town comment ruefully on the \"Romance\" that is missing from their own lives.\n\nIn a small hotel room, Genevi\u00e8ve and Dominique are together, but all is not well. She admits her passion for the young man, but wonders \"Where Is the Warmth?\" She gathers her things and leaves him asleep.\n\nAt a bus stop, the villagers encounter Genevi\u00e8ve on her way to [[Marseille]]. They beg her to return but, guilt-stricken and ashamed, she tells them that she can never go home again. They eventually convince her to return: \"all sins are forgivable\".\n\nThe villagers are asked to remain in their houses so as to not embarrass Genevi\u00e8ve when she arrives. Escorted by the priest and the Marquis, Genevi\u00e8ve walks through the empty street to the bakery and cautiously approaches her door.\n\nShe finds Aimable and attempts to tell him the truth, but he awkwardly refuses to listen, offering her dinner and insisting that she has returned from visiting her mother. Pompom arrives at the window, and Aimable angrily chastises the cat for running after \"some tom that looked good in the moonlight.\" He unleashes all of his pent-up bitterness toward Genevi\u00e8ve on the small cat, but offers it a saucer of milk. He has faithfully refilled the milk each day, and when Aimable charges that the cat will run off yet again, a tearful Genevi\u00e8ve assures him that \"she will not leave\". Reconciled, the two begin to prepare the bread for the next day.\n\nDenise begins the new day at the caf\u00e9, reprising her \"Chanson\", joined by the town in harmony.\n\n==Songs==\nThis song list reflects the recording of the 1990 London production.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"Chanson\" \u2013 Denise\n* \"If It Wasn't for You\" \u2013 Teacher, Priest, Marquis, and Villagers\n* \"Merci, Madame\" \u2013 Aimable and Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Bread \u2013 Villagers\n* \"Gifts of Love\" \u2013 Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Plain and Simple\" \u2013 Aimable and Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Proud Lady\" \u2013 Dominique\n* \"Look for the Woman\" \u2013 Teacher, Marquis, Claude, Barnab\u00e9, Antoine, Casimir, Pierre, Doumergue\n* \"Chanson (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise\n* \"Serenade\" \u2013 Dominique, Philippe, Aimable, and Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"[[Meadowlark (song)|Meadowlark]]\" \u2013 Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Buzz A-Buzz\" \u2013 Aimable, Marquis, Philippe, Villagers\n{{col-break}}\n;Act II\n* \"Chanson (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise\n* \"If It Wasn't for You\" \u2013 Priest, Teacher, Marquis, and Villagers\n* \"Any-Day-Now Day\" \u2013 Aimable, Villagers\n* \"Endless Delights\" \u2013 Dominique, Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Luckiest Man in the World\" \u2013 Claude, Village Men, Marquis, Simone, In\u00e8s, Nicole\n* \"Feminine Companionship\" \u2013 Claude, Village Men, Marquis, Simone, In\u00e8s, Nicole\n* \"If I Have to Live Alone\" \u2013 Aimable\n* \"Romance\" \u2013 Denise, Hortense, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Simone, Inez, Nicole\n* \"Where is the Warmth?\" \u2013 Genevi\u00e8ve\n* \"Gifts of Love (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise, Aimable, Genevi\u00e8ve, Villagers\n* \"Chanson (Reprise)\" \u2013 Denise, Aimable, Genevi\u00e8ve, Villagers\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Cast recordings==\nAlthough bootleg live recordings are known to exist, a full cast album of ''The Baker's Wife'' was never recorded at the time of its original tour in 1976. While the show was playing in Boston, it was seen by long-time theatre enthusiasts Bruce and Doris Yeko, who had only recently started up their own record label, [[Original Cast (record label)|''Take Home Tunes'']], devoted to the preservation of musical scores that might not otherwise be recorded.  Impressed by the score, the Yekos contacted Stephen Schwartz, who suggested to them that a full cast album might be recorded.<ref>Carol de Giere, ''Defying Gravity'', pp. 138-39.</ref> At that time, however, the couple had little experience in record production, having only released an EP of songs from ''[[The Robber Bridegroom (musical)|The Robber Bridegroom]]''. However, after ''The Baker's Wife'' closed on the road, the Yekos and Schwartz negotiated to record an LP of excerpts from the score, with the composer himself selecting what he considered to be the best songs (rather than those, necessarily, that might advance the plot).\n\nThe recording sessions took place in early 1977 in an apartment studio in Greenwich Village that was too small to accommodate an ensemble. As a result, Schwartz suggested that, to save both space and money, only the songs performed by the three protagonists would be recorded. Thus the resulting LP contained six solo numbers and five duets, performed by original cast members Paul Sorvino and Patti LuPone, along with Terri Ralston (who sang \"Chanson\").\n\nAt the same time, the Yekos produced and released an EP with additional songs performed by original cast member Sorvino along with [[Darlene Conley]], [[Denise Lor]], and [[Portia Nelson]] (who were not in the touring production) and composer/lyricist Stephen Schwartz and his wife, Carol.\n\nThis \"original cast\" LP of ''The Baker's Wife'' became very popular. It has since been re-released on CD twice: once in 1989 (the first CD to be released by Bruce Yeko's Original Cast label) and again in 1992.\n\nThe 1990 London production, directed by Trevor Nunn, was recorded and released on the JAY label as a lavish two-CD set.  This comprised 20 songs, of which 10 had been previously heard on the 1976 LP and one other from the studio cast EP. The remaining songs, not previously recorded, either came from the original tour, the 1985 off-Broadway revival, or had been specially written for the new London production.\n\nSince the late 1980s, songs from the show have also been recorded by solo artists. \"Meadowlark\" is by far the most frequently covered song, having been recorded by [[Sarah Brightman]], [[Betty Buckley]], [[Susan Egan]], [[Liz Callaway]], [[Sandy Campbell (singer)|Sandy Campbell]], [[Meredith Braun]], [[Dianne Pilkington]], [[Judy Kuhn]], [[Roslyn Kind]], [[Susannah Mars]] and others.\n\n==References==\n*De Giere, Carol.
