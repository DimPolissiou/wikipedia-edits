CBeebies Radio, however, has continued as a feature on the channel's website since 2013, and as a station on [[BBC Sounds]] broadcasting from 6am to 10pm. A magazine called ''CBeebies Weekly'' (now called CBeebies Magazine) was first published in 2006.\n\nSince 27 March 2013, CBeebies has been carried by the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]], sharing a channel with BFBS Extra.<ref>[http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 BFBS TV IS CHANGING] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017201105/http://www.bfbs.com/tv/node/823536 |date=17 October 2012 }}</ref> The UK channel is also available in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==International and Non-English versions==\n[[BBC Studios]] owns and operates the international CBeebies feeds, with most of them operating on a 24-hour schedule.\n\nThe first international launch for the CBeebies channel was in India in May 2007, although the channel was withdrawn at the end of November 2012 due to \"commercial considerations\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/11/02/bbc-pulls-plug-on-two-india-channels/|title=BBC Pulls Plug on Two India Channels|author=Will Davies|work=WSJ}}</ref>.

It is serving a similar schedule to the main channel. The block ceased alongside its main channel on 31 December 2018, with some programmes moving to [[Knowledge Network]].\n\nIn April 2015, BBC Worldwide signed with South Korean broadcaster [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] and Japanese broadcaster [[Kids Station]] to launch CBeebies blocks on both channels.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldwide/2015/cbeebies-programming-blocks</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, a channel for the [[MENA]] region was launched.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, CBeebies Asia was launched in Taiwan, replacing [[BBC Entertainment]].

This block features its own presentation, presenters and shows all dubbed into [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nOn 1 December 2019, The Australian feed launched in New Zealand on [[Sky (New Zealand)|Sky]].\n\n==Management==\nIn the UK, CBeebies is operated by the BBC Children's division and part of [[BBC North]]. The division is also responsible for CBBC and overall strategic responsibility for all of the BBC's domestic services for children rests with the Director of Children's, Alice Webb (since 2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/alice-webb|title=BBC - Alice Webb named as Director, BBC Children's - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The direction of the domestic CBeebies channel itself rested with [[Kay Benbow]], the last Controller of the channel commissioning all CBeebies content across BBC television, online, interactive TV, and radio.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography \u2013 Kay Benbow|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/controllers/kay_benbow.shtml|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref> She took over from the first controller [[Michael Carrington (television executive)|Michael Carrington]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/27/cbeebies-michael-carrington-bbc-turner |title=Carrington Leaves BBC |date=27 January 2010|work= by Mark Sweney, guardian.co.uk }}</ref> In 2017 it was announced that the CBeebies controller post will close in December 2017 and all content for the CBeebies brand would be commissioned by a new, pan BBC Children's role entitled Head of Content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tbivision.com/news/2017/07/benbow-exiting-bbc-childrens-shake/776711/|title=Benbow exiting in BBC Children's shake-up - TBI Vision - Page 776711|website=tbivision.com}}</ref>\n\nInternationally, CBeebies is owned by [[BBC Studios]], who operate the brand.\n\n==Presentation==\nThe links between programmes on CBeebies are primarily achieved through the use of [[Continuity (broadcasting)|in-vision continuity]], using presenters to interact with the children. In the UK, links are pre-recorded rather than broadcast live, as is the case on sister channel [[CBBC]]. They were originally pre-recorded from studio TC0 at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] in London, however, moved out in 2008 to [[Teddington Studios]], and returned briefly in 2010. From September 2011, the links have been based at the BBC's Northern base at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]], following the move of the BBC Children's department there. International variants feature broadcast links produced either in the corresponding country or from a central base.\n\n===Logo and idents===\n{{main|CBBC idents}}\n\n{{see also|History of BBC television idents}}\n\n===Presenters===\n\nAs well as hosting some of the shows, a number of presenters fill the gaps between the CBeebies shows, speaking directly to the child, leading activities based on a topic from the CBeebies website, showing viewers' birthday cards, and introducing the shows. Many of the presenters have histories as characters on other services or on children's programmes.\n\nIn the UK, presenters seen on the channel and the stranded service are:\n* [[Andy Day]] (2007\u2013present)\n* [[Katy Ashworth]] (2011\u2013present)\n* [[Cat Sandion]] (2013\u2013present)\n* [[Rebecca Keatley]] (2014\u2013present)\n* [[Ben Cajee]] (2015\u2013present)\n* [[Warrick Brownlow-Pike|Dodge T.

Includes programmes such as ''[[Something Special (TV series)|Something Special]]'', ''[[Baby Jake]]'', ''[[Twirlywoos]]'', ''[[Raa Raa the Noisy Lion]]'', ''[[Postman Pat]]'', ''[[Bing (TV series)|Bing]]'', ''[[Hey Duggee]]'', ''[[Tinpo]]'', ''[[Biggleton]]'', ''[[Justin's House]]'', ''[[Octonauts]]'' and ''[[Go Jetters]]''. \n* '''Discover and Do''' \u2013 Late morning and early afternoon, weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. The strand is aimed at young children who would not be attending school or pre-school. It often contains programmes that give a learning opportunity to viewers, such as ''[[Show Me Show Me]]'', ''[[Let's Play (TV series)|Let's Play]]'', ''[[Andy's Baby Animals]]'', ''[[Teletubbies]]'', ''[[My First]]'', ''[[Alphablocks]]'', ''[[Numberblocks]]'' & ''[[Yakka Dee]]''. The hour between 12:00&nbsp;pm and 1:00&nbsp;pm is branded as Lunch Time and features shows such as ''[[My World Kitchen]]'', ''[[Molly and Mack]]'' & [[Patchwork Pals]].\n* '''Big Fun Time''' \u2013 Late afternoon weekdays between 3:00&nbsp;pm and 5:45&nbsp;pm. This strand is notable for aiming at the higher end of its remit, airing programming for children who have recently returned from school. Programmes include ''[[Swashbuckle]]'', ''[[Do You Know? (TV series)|Do You Know?]]'', ''[[Andy's Safari Adventures]]'', ''[[Apple Tree House]]'', ''[[Catie's Amazing Machines]]'', ''[[Bitz & Bob]]'', ''[[Waffle the Wonder Dog]]'' & ''[[Gigglebiz]]''. \n* '''Bedtime''' \u2013 The final hour and 15 minutes of CBeebies broadcasting between 5:45&nbsp;pm and 7:00&nbsp;pm. The original stranded section of the channel (and the only to still air to this day), Bedtime helps to prepare children for bed and features calm-natured programming. Programmes include ''[[Clangers]]'',  ''[[Moon & Me]]'',  ''[[Charlie and Lola (TV series)|Charlie and Lola]]'', ''[[Tee and Mo]]'' and ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' Story-telling is often told during the programmes. The final programme is always the ''Bedtime Stories'' slot (see below) and is followed by a final song, \"The Time Has Come to Say Goodnight\", before the channel closes for the day and [[BBC Four]] starts up. CBeebies Bedtime was renamed from Bedtime Hour as of 4 February 2019.\n\nWhen these segments were initially introduced, each segment featured its own presenting team and set, with [[Chris Jarvis (presenter)|Chris Jarvis]] and [[Pui Fan Lee]] ([[Alex Winters]] and [[Cerrie Burnell]] after they left in January 2009) presenting '''Discover and Do''' in the CBeebies \"living room\"; '''Lunch Time''' in the \"kitchen\"; '''Bedtime Hour''' in the \"bedroom\"; [[Sidney Sloane]] (plus [[Andy Day]] when he joined the channel later in 2007) presenting '''Get, Set, Go!''' in the \"living room\" and '''Big Fun Time''' in the \"garage\". However, since moving production to Manchester this is no longer the case, with the exception of '''Bedtime Hour''' which is presented from the area nearest the house's bed.\n\n[[File:Bedtime Hour.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|The Bedtime Hour on-screen ident from March 2003 to March 2016.]]\n\n===Storytimes===\nWhile the lunchtime story is usually read by one of the regular presenters, the final show of each day, the ''Bedtime Story'' (known as ''St\u00f2iridh'' in Gaelic) is read by a guest storyteller, including well known actors, comedians, and past presenters of BBC children's television (Like [[Derek Jacobi|Sir Derek Jacobi]] who Narrated all 100 episodes of 2007's ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' when he appeared in April 2018 and again in June 2018).

It is serving a similar schedule to the main channel. The block ceased alongside its main channel on 31 December 2018, with some programmes moving to [[Knowledge Network]].\n\nIn April 2015, BBC Worldwide signed with South Korean broadcaster [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] and Japanese broadcaster [[Kids Station]] to launch CBeebies blocks on both channels.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldwide/2015/cbeebies-programming-blocks</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, a channel for the [[MENA]] region was launched.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, CBeebies Asia was launched in Taiwan, replacing [[BBC Entertainment]].

From September 2011, the links have been based at the BBC's Northern base at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]], following the move of the BBC Children's department there. International variants feature broadcast links produced either in the corresponding country or from a central base.\n\n===Logo and idents===\n{{main|CBBC idents}}\n\n{{see also|History of BBC television idents}}\n\n===Presenters===\n\nAs well as hosting some of the shows, a number of presenters fill the gaps between the CBeebies shows, speaking directly to the child, leading activities based on a topic from the CBeebies website, showing viewers' birthday cards, and introducing the shows. Many of the presenters have histories as characters on other services or on children's programmes.\n\nIn the UK, presenters seen on the channel and the stranded service are:\n* [[Andy Day]] (2007\u2013present)\n* [[Katy Ashworth]] (2011\u2013present)\n* [[Cat Sandion]] (2013\u2013present)\n* [[Rebecca Keatley]] (2014\u2013present)\n* [[Ben Cajee]] (2015\u2013present)\n* [[Warrick Brownlow-Pike|Dodge T.

Includes programmes such as ''[[Something Special (TV series)|Something Special]]'', ''[[Baby Jake]]'', ''[[Twirlywoos]]'', ''[[Raa Raa the Noisy Lion]]'', ''[[Postman Pat]]'', ''[[Bing (TV series)|Bing]]'', ''[[Hey Duggee]]'', ''[[Tinpo]]'', ''[[Biggleton]]'', ''[[Justin's House]]'', ''[[Octonauts]]'' and ''[[Go Jetters]]''. \n* '''Discover and Do''' \u2013 Late morning and early afternoon, weekdays between 9:00&nbsp;am and 3:00&nbsp;pm. The strand is aimed at young children who would not be attending school or pre-school. It often contains programmes that give a learning opportunity to viewers, such as ''[[Show Me Show Me]]'', ''[[Let's Play (TV series)|Let's Play]]'', ''[[Andy's Baby Animals]]'', ''[[Teletubbies]]'', ''[[My First]]'', ''[[Alphablocks]]'', ''[[Numberblocks]]'' & ''[[Yakka Dee]]''. The hour between 12:00&nbsp;pm and 1:00&nbsp;pm is branded as Lunch Time and features shows such as ''[[My World Kitchen]]'', ''[[Molly and Mack]]'' & [[Patchwork Pals]].\n* '''Big Fun Time''' \u2013 Late afternoon weekdays between 3:00&nbsp;pm and 5:45&nbsp;pm. This strand is notable for aiming at the higher end of its remit, airing programming for children who have recently returned from school. Programmes include ''[[Swashbuckle]]'', ''[[Do You Know? (TV series)|Do You Know?]]'', ''[[Andy's Safari Adventures]]'', ''[[Apple Tree House]]'', ''[[Catie's Amazing Machines]]'', ''[[Bitz & Bob]]'', ''[[Waffle the Wonder Dog]]'' & ''[[Gigglebiz]]''. \n* '''Bedtime''' \u2013 The final hour and 15 minutes of CBeebies broadcasting between 5:45&nbsp;pm and 7:00&nbsp;pm. The original stranded section of the channel (and the only to still air to this day), Bedtime helps to prepare children for bed and features calm-natured programming. Programmes include ''[[Clangers]]'',  ''[[Moon & Me]]'',  ''[[Charlie and Lola (TV series)|Charlie and Lola]]'', ''[[Tee and Mo]]'' and ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' Story-telling is often told during the programmes. The final programme is always the ''Bedtime Stories'' slot (see below) and is followed by a final song, \"The Time Has Come to Say Goodnight\", before the channel closes for the day and [[BBC Four]] starts up. CBeebies Bedtime was renamed from Bedtime Hour as of 4 February 2019.\n\nWhen these segments were initially introduced, each segment featured its own presenting team and set, with [[Chris Jarvis (presenter)|Chris Jarvis]] and [[Pui Fan Lee]] ([[Alex Winters]] and [[Cerrie Burnell]] after they left in January 2009) presenting '''Discover and Do''' in the CBeebies \"living room\"; '''Lunch Time''' in the \"kitchen\"; '''Bedtime Hour''' in the \"bedroom\"; [[Sidney Sloane]] (plus [[Andy Day]] when he joined the channel later in 2007) presenting '''Get, Set, Go!''' in the \"living room\" and '''Big Fun Time''' in the \"garage\". However, since moving production to Manchester this is no longer the case, with the exception of '''Bedtime Hour''' which is presented from the area nearest the house's bed.\n\n[[File:Bedtime Hour.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|The Bedtime Hour on-screen ident from March 2003 to March 2016.]]\n\n===Storytimes===\nWhile the lunchtime story is usually read by one of the regular presenters, the final show of each day, the ''Bedtime Story'' (known as ''St\u00f2iridh'' in Gaelic) is read by a guest storyteller, including well known actors, comedians, and past presenters of BBC children's television (Like [[Derek Jacobi|Sir Derek Jacobi]] who Narrated all 100 episodes of 2007's ''[[In the Night Garden...]]'' when he appeared in April 2018 and again in June 2018).
