Austenal founders, Reiner Erdle and Charles Prange worked to improve investment chrome base castings utilizing two separate investments: The first coating named 'protective coat\" giving a smooth finish was smothered with alcohol binder investment to obtain a correct expansion. This technology replaced gold alloy with [[vitallium]] and was popular in depression time. During the 1930s, Austenal expanded into aircraft engine [[superchargers]] with superior castings when [[General Electric]] asked for help to improve manufacturing practices for wartime production demands.\n\nHowe Sound Company, a metals and mining business, acquired Austenal in 1958, and a year later in 1959, Howe acquired Michigan Steel Casting Co. (MISCO), which provided the monolithic shell process, which uses a ceramic shell with thin, strong walls to increase control of the solidification process to produce a sounder [[casting]].\n\nHowe became Howmet in 1965, marking a transition from a mining company to a manufacturer of precision metal products. Howmet was purchased in 1975 by [[Pechiney]], a multinational aluminum company. In 1989, Pechiney purchased the Cercast group of companies, bringing Howmet into the aluminum casting industry.\n\nIn 1995, Pechiney sold Howmet to a joint venture between [[Thiokol]] and [[The Carlyle Group]]. By late 1997 the ownership structure of Howmet had morphed into a distribution of Thiokol owning 62%, Carlyle 23%, and the public 15%. Thiokol later in 1998 changed its name to Cordant Technologies Inc. By February 1999, Cordant had acquired an 84.7% stake in Howmet.\n\nIn 2000, Cordant sold its stake in Howmet Corp. to [[Alcoa]], which merged Howmet into its Alcoa Industrial Components unit. In 2004, Howmet was merged to form the Alcoa Investment Casting and Forged Products unit. In 2007, Howmet was renamed Alcoa Howmet as a division of the newly formed Alcoa Power and Propulsion unit.\n\nOn November 1, 2016, Alcoa Inc. spun off its bauxite, alumina, and aluminum operations to a new company called Alcoa Corp. Alcoa Inc. was renamed Arconic Inc., and retained the operations in aluminum rolling (excluding the Warrick operations), aluminum plate, precision castings, and aerospace and industrial fasteners.\n\nOn April 1, 2020, Howmet was separated from [[Arconic]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2020/03/31/arconic-completes-split-into-two-companies.html | title=Arconic completes split into two companies | first=Julia | last=Mericle | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=March 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Locations==\n* Acuna, Mexico\n* [[Branford, Connecticut]]\n* [[Cleveland, OH]]\n* [[Dives-sur-Mer]], France\n* [[Dover, New Jersey]] - (2)\n* [[\u00e9vron|Evron]], France\n* Exeter, UK - (2)\n* [[Gennevilliers]], France\n* [[Georgetown, Ontario]]\n* [[Hampton, Virginia]]\n* [[La Porte, Indiana]]\n* [[Laval, Quebec]]\n* [[Morristown, Tennessee]]\n* [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], Hungary\n* Nomi, Japan\n* [[Whitehall, Michigan]] - (6)\n* [[Wichita Falls, Texas]]\n* [[Winsted, Connecticut]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Howmet TX]] - Howmet-backed turbine race car.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.howmet.com}}\n{{Finance links\n| name      = Howmet Aerospace Inc.\n| google    = HWM\n| yahoo     = HWM\n| bloomberg = HWM:US\n| symbol    = HWM\n| sec_cik   = HWM\n}}\n\n{{Alcoa}}\n[[Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Arconic]]\n[[Category:Aerospace companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Alcoa]]\n[[Category:Howmet Aerospace]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American industrial company}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name                = Howmet Aerospace Inc.\n| type                = [[Public company]]\n| traded_as           = {{New York Stock Exchange|HWM}}<BR>[[S&P 500 Index]] component\n| industry            = Manufacturing\n| founded             = \n| hq_location         = [[Whitehall, Michigan]], U.S.\n| key_people          = John C.

Howmet was purchased in 1975 by [[Pechiney]], a multinational aluminum company. In 1989, Pechiney purchased the Cercast group of companies, bringing Howmet into the aluminum casting industry.\n\nIn 1995, Pechiney sold Howmet to a joint venture between [[Thiokol]] and [[The Carlyle Group]]. By late 1997 the ownership structure of Howmet had morphed into a distribution of Thiokol owning 62%, Carlyle 23%, and the public 15%. Thiokol later in 1998 changed its name to Cordant Technologies Inc. By February 1999, Cordant had acquired an 84.7% stake in Howmet.\n\nIn 2000, Cordant sold its stake in Howmet Corp. to [[Alcoa]], which merged Howmet into its Alcoa Industrial Components unit. In 2004, Howmet was merged to form the Alcoa Investment Casting and Forged Products unit. In 2007, Howmet was renamed Alcoa Howmet as a division of the newly formed Alcoa Power and Propulsion unit.\n\nOn November 1, 2016, Alcoa Inc. spun off its bauxite, alumina, and aluminum operations to a new company called Alcoa Corp. Alcoa Inc. was renamed Arconic Inc., and retained the operations in aluminum rolling (excluding the Warrick operations), aluminum plate, precision castings, and aerospace and industrial fasteners.\n\nOn April 1, 2020, Howmet was separated from [[Arconic]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2020/03/31/arconic-completes-split-into-two-companies.html | title=Arconic completes split into two companies | first=Julia | last=Mericle | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=March 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Locations==\n* Acuna, Mexico\n* [[Branford, Connecticut]]\n* [[Cleveland, OH]]\n* [[Dives-sur-Mer]], France\n* [[Dover, New Jersey]] - (2)\n* [[\u00e9vron|Evron]], France\n* Exeter, UK - (2)\n* [[Gennevilliers]], France\n* [[Georgetown, Ontario]]\n* [[Hampton, Virginia]]\n* [[La Porte, Indiana]]\n* [[Laval, Quebec]]\n* [[Morristown, Tennessee]]\n* [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], Hungary\n* Nomi, Japan\n* [[Whitehall, Michigan]] - (6)\n* [[Wichita Falls, Texas]]\n* [[Winsted, Connecticut]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Howmet TX]] - Howmet-backed turbine race car.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.howmet.com}}\n{{Finance links\n| name      = Howmet Aerospace Inc.\n| google    = HWM\n| yahoo     = HWM\n| bloomberg = HWM:US\n| symbol    = HWM\n| sec_cik   = HWM\n}}\n\n{{Alcoa}}\n[[Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Arconic]]\n[[Category:Aerospace companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Alcoa]]\n[[Category:Howmet Aerospace]]\n", "name_user": "P.erwin", "label": "safe", "comment": "Updated industry to correct industry.

The government's policies generally support the free practice of religion in the country, and it provides funding to religious organizations and anti-discrimination programs on a regular basis. According to [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and the [[Norwegian Police Service|Norwegian police]], religiously motivated hate speech is prevalent, particularly online, and primarily targeting the Muslim and Jewish communities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe origins of the modern Kingdom of Norway can be traced to the kingdoms established by Vikings during the [[Middle Ages]].

[[Muslims]] comprise 2.9 percent of the population. [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostalists]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism|Sikhs]], [[Hindus]], and [[Judaism|Jews]] each make up less than 1 percent of the population. The [[Norwegian Humanist Association]], with a registered membership of around 6 percent of the population, accounts for nearly all those registered with [[Life stance|life-stance]] organizations (nonreligious or philosophical communities with organizational ethics based on humanist values).<ref name=\":0\">''[https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/norway International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Norway],'' US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nImmigrants comprise the majority of members of religious groups outside the Church of Norway. Immigrants from [[Poland]] and the [[Philippines]] have increased the number of Catholics, while those from such countries as [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Somalia]] have increased the size of the Muslim community. Catholics and Muslims generally have greater representation in cities than in rural areas. Muslims are located throughout the country, but the population is concentrated in the [[Oslo]] region. Many recent immigrants from Muslim majority countries still reside in asylum reception centers. According to [[Norwegian Directorate of Immigration]] statistics, approximately 5,600 of the 6,300 persons residing in reception centers as of October 2017 come from Muslim majority countries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Norway}}\n=== Unification and Christianization of the Kingdom of Norway (10th c.

As of 2013, it has a population of 6,761 inhabitants, while the town of \u0160ekovi\u0107i has a population of 1,519 inhabitants.\n\n==History==\nFrom the Roman period to the present day major roads were cutting through the \u0160ekovi\u0107i region. These roads connected regions East of Drina River with Central Bosnia. \u0160ekovi\u0107i got its name by one portion of its inhabitants from \u0160ekovina in [[Herzegovina]], who immigrated to this region at the end of the 17th century. Until the end of the 17th century Sekovici was a well-inhabited area, till army invasions and different diseases decreased the population of \u0160ekovi\u0107i and almost wiped out the first people living there. Soon after that the new inhabitants from Herzegovina settled in \u0160ekovi\u0107i and they make up most of today\u2019s populations. One of the first settlers beginning XVII left \u0160ekovi\u0107i, Ilija Bir\u010danin, Had\u017ei Milentije and Prote Matije Nenadovi\u0107. Because of the family and other ties through the monastery this region had strong military cooperation with Serbia during the [[First Serbian Uprising]]. Ivan Groznog's mother Jelica Jak\u0161i\u0107 Glinska is from \u0160ekovi\u0107i and because of the Monastery Papra\u0107a and Russian Czar Palace had a good relationship. Monastery Lovnica and Papraca in the past were significant cultural and freedom centers. From the 16th century these two monasteries had ties with Russia, and monasteries in [[Serbia]], [[Poland]] and [[Vlachs]]. \u0160ekovi\u0107i have special places in NOB (Serbian: Narodno Oslobodilacka Borba, English:Peoples Freedom Fight), they belong to one of the first uprising regions in [[Yugoslavia]].

As of 2013, it has a population of 6,761 inhabitants.\n\n==History==\nFrom the Roman period to the present day major roads were cutting through the \u0160ekovi\u0107i region. These roads connected regions East of Drina River with Central Bosnia. \u0160ekovi\u0107i got its name by one portion of its inhabitants from \u0160ekovina in [[Herzegovina]], who immigrated to this region at the end of the 17th century. Until the end of the 17th century Sekovici was a well-inhabited area, till army invasions and different diseases decreased the population of \u0160ekovi\u0107i and almost wiped out the first people living there. Soon after that the new inhabitants from Herzegovina settled in \u0160ekovi\u0107i and they make up most of today\u2019s populations. One of the first settlers beginning XVII left \u0160ekovi\u0107i, Ilija Bir\u010danin, Had\u017ei Milentije and Prote Matije Nenadovi\u0107. Because of the family and other ties through the monastery this region had strong military cooperation with Serbia during the [[First Serbian Uprising]]. Ivan Groznog's mother Jelica Jak\u0161i\u0107 Glinska is from \u0160ekovi\u0107i and because of the Monastery Papra\u0107a and Russian Czar Palace had a good relationship. Monastery Lovnica and Papraca in the past were significant cultural and freedom centers. From the 16th century these two monasteries had ties with Russia, and monasteries in [[Serbia]], [[Poland]] and [[Vlachs]]. \u0160ekovi\u0107i have special places in NOB (Serbian: Narodno Oslobodilacka Borba, English:Peoples Freedom Fight), they belong to one of the first uprising regions in [[Yugoslavia]]. In \u0160ekovi\u0107i were formed the Prva Bircanslka Brigada (First Birac Brigate), Sesta Istocnobosanska Brigada (Sixst Estern Bosnian Brigate) and Prva Pionirska Divizija ( First Pionir Division). In 1943, Sekovici was the military, political and cultural center for eastern Bosnia, according to author Rudi Petovara. Inside of it was the highest military and political leadership for Eastern Bosnia.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| type = \n| percentages = pagr\n|1971|10570 |1991|9639 |2013|6761\n}}\nAccording to the 2013 census results, the municipality has 6,761 inhabitants.\n\n===Ethnic groups===\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The report highlighted the issues of having an old private facility at the end of its lifespan servicing a growing ice sports community and national sports franchise in the national capital. The report suggested a full business case and plan be drawn up at exploring alternative options for building a new multi-purpose facility in the fastest growing areas of Canberra, the [[Molonglo Valley]] and [[Gungahlin]], where the lower land values can boost a feasibility case for construction compared to re-building in Phillip.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sport.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/811331/ACT-Indoor-Facilities-Combined-Document.pdf | title = Full Report: ACT Indoor Sports Facilities Study | publisher=ACT Government - Sport and Recreation Services | first= | last= | date=December 2015 | accessdate = 2016-04-21 }}</ref> Shane Rattenbury responded to the release of the report by saying a new ice sports facility with duel rinks for competition and practice was in the Government's longer-term plans but stressed the need for community engagement and private sector support.

This rivalry intensified at the end of the [[2015 AIHL season]] when the Northstars came from behind to beat the CBR Brave in the Goodall Cup semi-finals. The Brave scored two shorthanded goals on the way to securing a 3\u20130 lead deep into the second period of the match before League MVP and AIHL record breaker, Geordie Wudrick, came to life and scored a third period hat trick that set up the Northstars comeback win as they scored a fourth and final goal to win the match 4\u20133. The Brave were devastated at missing out on the chance to contest the Goodall Cup final for the second year straight and just before the start of the 2016 AIHL season the club announced the signing of the very player that knocked them out the year before, naming Geordie Wudrick as one of the Brave's six import signings for 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/aihl-canberra-brave-snare-sharpshooter-geordie-wudrick-from-defending-champs-20160422-gocgq6.html | title = AIHL: Canberra Brave snare sharpshooter Geordie Wudrick from defending champs | publisher=[[The Canberra Times]] | first=Jon | last=Tuxworth | date=2016-04-22 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}</ref>[[File:CBR_Brave_fan-made_fake_classifieds_poster,_May_2016.png|thumb|right|Fan made poster]][[File:CBR_Brave_Welcome_to_the_Middle_of_Nowhere_Placard,_May_2016.png|thumb|left|Middle of nowhere placard given out pre-game on 28 May 2016 for the CBR Brave vs Newcastle North Stars AIHL match]] It is very rare in the AIHL to see players switch teams so the move of Wudrick from Newcastle to Canberra made headlines.

Webster body slammed Wudrick from behind, knocking him out cold and hospitalising the Brave player. Wudrick missed a large amount of the 2016 AIHL season as a result. The inaction by the match referees incensed the CBR Brave team and fans and this carried through to the return double header weekend in Canberra in August. Brave DJ set the tone for the encounters with a rendition of [[The Imperial March|The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)]] from [[Star Wars]] when the Melbourne Ice players walked out onto the ice. A total of 252 penalty minutes were handed out during the two matches which also saw 6 players ejected, 5 players suspended, 4 separate fights and an all-out on ice melee between all the players. In amongst all the carnage there was nineteen goals scored in the first game and a further seven scored in the second game with two hard fought one goal victories being split between the two teams. The Ice secured a 10\u20139 victory in the first match after leading 7-2 before a third period rally by the Brave saw them score six unanswered goals to temporarily take the lead 8-7 before succumbing to the visitors late on. While the Brave won the second match 4\u20133 to inflict only the second regulation time loss of the 2016 season on the Melbourne Ice.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://brave.theaihl.com/leagues/hockey_boxscores.cfm?clientid=6061&leagueid=25105&gameid=1547440 | title = CBR Brave vs Melbourne Ice \u2013 06 August 2016 | publisher= www.theaihl.com | first= | last= | date=2016-08-06 | accessdate = 2017-01-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://brave.theaihl.com/leagues/hockey_boxscores.cfm?clientID=6061&leagueID=25105&gameID=1547442 | title = CBR Brave vs Melbourne Ice \u2013 07 August 2016 | publisher= www.theaihl.com | first= | last= | date=2016-08-07 | accessdate = 2017-01-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/cbr-brave-hockey-gladiators-get-skates-on-as-national-ice-finals-loom-20160801-gqi0vs.html | title = CBR Brave hockey gladiators get skates on as national ice finals loom | publisher=[[The Canberra Times]] | first=Ian | last=Warden | date=2016-08-08 | accessdate = 2017-01-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/ice-hockey-cbr-brave-vs-melbourne-ice-20160807-gqmv78.html | title = AIHL: Canberra Brave coach Josh Unice says 'nobody wants to play us in the finals' | publisher=[[The Canberra Times]] | first=Caden | last=Helmers | date=2016-08-07 | accessdate = 2017-01-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe two teams met again in the semi-finals of the [[2016 AIHL season#Goodall Cup playoffs|AIHL Finals weekend]] as 1st (Ice) versus 4th (Brave).

The purpose of the foundation is to raise awareness and assist people in need who are struggling with mental health issues, particularly PTSD and depression in young men. The Foundation was born out of terrible circumstance when the brother-in-law, Robbie, of former Brave captain Mark Rummukainen sadly took his own life after suffering from depression. Robbie was well known to the Brave management and players with the loss felt by the whole Brave community. Since inception, the foundation has raised money through a number of events including dinners with players and auctioning off match-worn hockey gear. The Brave Foundation spends the money raised on tangible achievements as opposed to handing money over to a charity and not knowing where it ends up. For example, putting people through a program called \u2018Accidental Councillor\u2019 or funding of additional telephones for Lifeline. The Foundation has formed strong connections with a number of reputable charities and services such as [[Lifeline (crisis support service)|Lifeline]], [[beyondblue]] and [[Soldier On (charity)|Soldier On]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://brave.theaihl.com/leagues/newsletter.cfm?page=95298&clientID=6061&leagueID=25105 | title = The BRAVE Foundation | publisher=www.theaihl.com | first=Georgia | last=Briggs | date=2016-05-24 | accessdate = 2017-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Ownership===\n\nIn 2014, the ACT community banded together to raise funds to keep AIHL hockey in Canberra following the demise of the [[Canberra Knights|Knights]].

CBR set then league records for most points (72 points) and most wins (24 wins) in a regular AIHL season. The Brave won the finals weekend in Melbourne, defeating the [[Melbourne Mustangs]] 5\u20131 in semi final 1 before defeating the [[Sydney Bears]] 4\u20133 in overtime in the Goodall Cup final. Trevor Gerling was named finals MVP and finished the regular season equal top point scorer (67 points) with [[Perth Thunder|Thunder]] player Pier-Olivier Grandmaison. The Cup victory provided Joey Hughes with his sixth Goodall Cup success, breaking the league record for a single player. It was the first time a Canberra franchise had won the AIHL championship and secured the Goodall Cup. While it was only the second time a team from the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] had claimed the Goodall Cup. An ACT representative team, which also included Dave Lewis and Mark Rummukainen, won the cup in 1998 in the old inter-state tournament format.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:800px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#0c1f3d;\" colspan=\"4\"| <span style=\"color:#FFFF00;\">2018 Championship Roster</span>\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd; width:90px;\"| Goaltenders\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#29'''</small> Tynan Theobald || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#31'''</small> Jakob Doornbos || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#35'''</small> Alexandre Tetreault || {{flagicon|CAN}} <small>'''#92'''</small> Mat Hewitt\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd\"| Defencemen\n|-\n| {{flagicon|CAN}} <small>'''#4'''</small> Channing Bresciani || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#7'''</small> Bayley Kubara || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#12'''</small> Mark Rummukainen || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#17'''</small> James Byers\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#25'''</small> Matt Buskas || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#26'''</small> Darcy Flanagan || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#59'''</small> Per Daniel G\u00f6ransson || {{flagicon|NZL}} <small>'''#81'''</small> Matthew Harvey <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)|C]])'''</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd\"| Forwards\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#3'''</small> Mitchell Henning || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#6'''</small> Christopher McPhail || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#9'''</small> Wehebe Darge <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains|A]])'''</small> || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#11'''</small> David Lewis \n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#14'''</small> Jayden Lewis || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#15'''</small> Casey Kubara || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#16'''</small> Tyler Kubara || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#19'''</small> Jordan Gavin <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains|A]])'''</small>\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#20'''</small> Hayden Dawes || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#24'''</small> Joseph Hughes || {{flagicon|CAN}} <small>'''#48'''</small> Chris Leveille || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#64'''</small> Kai Miettinen <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains|A]])'''</small>\n|- style=\"border:0px;\"\n| {{flagicon|LAT}} <small>'''#66'''</small> Ainars Podzins || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#71'''</small> Jordan Brunt || {{flagicon|USA}} <small>'''#78'''</small> Trevor Gerling || \n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd\"| Coaching staff\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"| {{align|center|{{flagicon|AUS}} Robert Starke <small>'''([[Head coach]])'''</small>}} || {{align|center|{{flagicon|AUS}} Mike Sargeant <small>'''([[Assistant coach|Assistant]])'''</small>}} || {{align|center|{{flagicon|CAN}} Gordon Cocknell <small>'''([[Assistant coach|Assistant]])'''</small>}}\n|}\n\n'''<big>2019 Premiership roster</big>'''\n\nThe 2019 Brave team broke AIHL regular season records for most wins (26), most points (79), largest winning streak (17 matches), most goals scored (161), least goals conceded in a 28 match season (67) and least losses in a 28 match season (2).

The report highlighted the issues of having an old private facility at the end of its lifespan servicing a growing ice sports community and national sports franchise in the national capital. The report suggested a full business case and plan be drawn up at exploring alternative options for building a new multi-purpose facility in the fastest growing areas of Canberra, the [[Molonglo Valley]] and [[Gungahlin]], where the lower land values can boost a feasibility case for construction compared to re-building in Phillip.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sport.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/811331/ACT-Indoor-Facilities-Combined-Document.pdf | title = Full Report: ACT Indoor Sports Facilities Study | publisher=ACT Government - Sport and Recreation Services | first= | last= | date=December 2015 | accessdate = 2016-04-21 }}</ref> Shane Rattenbury responded to the release of the report by saying a new ice sports facility with duel rinks for competition and practice was in the Government's longer-term plans but stressed the need for community engagement and private sector support.

This rivalry intensified at the end of the [[2015 AIHL season]] when the Northstars came from behind to beat the CBR Brave in the Goodall Cup semi-finals. The Brave scored two shorthanded goals on the way to securing a 3-0 lead deep into the second period of the match before League MVP and AIHL record breaker, Geordie Wudrick, came to life and scored a third period hat trick that set up the Northstars comeback win as they scored a fourth and final goal to win the match 4-3. The Brave were devastated at missing out on the chance to contest the Goodall Cup final for the second year straight and just before the start of the 2016 AIHL season the club announced the signing of the very player that knocked them out the year before, naming Geordie Wudrick as one of the Brave's six import signings for 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/aihl-canberra-brave-snare-sharpshooter-geordie-wudrick-from-defending-champs-20160422-gocgq6.html | title = AIHL: Canberra Brave snare sharpshooter Geordie Wudrick from defending champs | publisher=[[The Canberra Times]] | first=Jon | last=Tuxworth | date=2016-04-22 | accessdate = 2016-12-30 }}</ref>[[File:CBR_Brave_fan-made_fake_classifieds_poster,_May_2016.png|thumb|right|Fan made poster]][[File:CBR_Brave_Welcome_to_the_Middle_of_Nowhere_Placard,_May_2016.png|thumb|left|Middle of nowhere placard given out pre-game on 28 May 2016 for the CBR Brave vs Newcastle North Stars AIHL match]] It is very rare in the AIHL to see players switch teams so the move of Wudrick from Newcastle to Canberra made headlines.

Webster body slammed Wudrick from behind, knocking him out cold and hospitalising the Brave player. Wudrick missed a large amount of the 2016 AIHL season as a result. The inaction by the match referees incensed the CBR Brave team and fans and this carried through to the return double header weekend in Canberra in August. Brave DJ set the tone for the encounters with a rendition of [[The Imperial March|The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)]] from [[Star Wars]] when the Melbourne Ice players walked out onto the ice. A total of 252 penalty minutes were handed out during the two matches which also saw 6 players ejected, 5 players suspended, 4 separate fights and an all-out on ice melee between all the players. In amongst all the carnage there was nineteen goals scored in the first game and a further seven scored in the second game with two hard fought one goal victories being split between the two teams. The Ice secured a 10-9 victory in the first match after leading 7-2 before a third period rally by the Brave saw them score six unanswered goals to temporarily take the lead 8-7 before succumbing to the visitors late on. While the Brave won the second match 4-3 to inflict only the second regulation time loss of the 2016 season on the Melbourne Ice.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://brave.theaihl.com/leagues/hockey_boxscores.cfm?clientid=6061&leagueid=25105&gameid=1547440 | title = CBR Brave vs Melbourne Ice \u2013 06 August 2016 | publisher= www.theaihl.com | first= | last= | date=2016-08-06 | accessdate = 2017-01-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://brave.theaihl.com/leagues/hockey_boxscores.cfm?clientID=6061&leagueID=25105&gameID=1547442 | title = CBR Brave vs Melbourne Ice \u2013 07 August 2016 | publisher= www.theaihl.com | first= | last= | date=2016-08-07 | accessdate = 2017-01-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/cbr-brave-hockey-gladiators-get-skates-on-as-national-ice-finals-loom-20160801-gqi0vs.html | title = CBR Brave hockey gladiators get skates on as national ice finals loom | publisher=[[The Canberra Times]] | first=Ian | last=Warden | date=2016-08-08 | accessdate = 2017-01-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/ice-hockey-cbr-brave-vs-melbourne-ice-20160807-gqmv78.html | title = AIHL: Canberra Brave coach Josh Unice says 'nobody wants to play us in the finals' | publisher=[[The Canberra Times]] | first=Caden | last=Helmers | date=2016-08-07 | accessdate = 2017-01-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe two teams met again in the semi-finals of the [[2016 AIHL season#Goodall Cup playoffs|AIHL Finals weekend]] as 1st (Ice) versus 4th (Brave).

The purpose of the foundation is to raise awareness and assist people in need who are struggling with mental health issues, particularly PTSD and depression in young men. The Foundation was born out of terrible circumstance when the brother-in-law, Robbie, of former Brave captain Mark Rummukainen sadly took his own life after suffering from depression. Robbie was well known to the Brave management and players with the loss felt by the whole Brave community. Since inception, the foundation has raised money through a number of events including dinners with players and auctioning off match-worn hockey gear. The Brave Foundation spends the money raised on tangible achievements as opposed to handing money over to a charity and not knowing where it ends up. For example, putting people through a program called \u2018Accidental Councillor\u2019 or funding of additional telephones for Lifeline. The Foundation has formed strong connections with a number of reputable charities and services such as [[Lifeline (crisis support service)|Lifeline]], [[beyondblue]] and [[Soldier On (charity)|Soldier On]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://brave.theaihl.com/leagues/newsletter.cfm?page=95298&clientID=6061&leagueID=25105 | title = The BRAVE Foundation | publisher=www.theaihl.com | first=Georgia | last=Briggs | date=2016-05-24 | accessdate = 2017-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Ownership===\n\nIn 2014, the ACT community banded together to raise funds to keep AIHL hockey in Canberra following the demise of the [[Canberra Knights|Knights]].

CBR set then league records for most points (72 points) and most wins (24 wins) in a regular AIHL season. The Brave won the finals weekend in Melbourne, defeating the [[Melbourne Mustangs]] 5-1 in semi final 1 before defeating the [[Sydney Bears]] 4-3 in overtime in the Goodall Cup final. Trevor Gerling was named finals MVP and finished the regular season equal top point scorer (67 points) with [[Perth Thunder|Thunder]] player Pier-Olivier Grandmaison. The Cup victory provided Joey Hughes with his sixth Goodall Cup success, breaking the league record for a single player. It was the first time a Canberra franchise had won the AIHL championship and secured the Goodall Cup. While it was only the second time a team from the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] had claimed the Goodall Cup. An ACT representative team, which also included Dave Lewis and Mark Rummukainen, won the cup in 1998 in the old inter-state tournament format.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:800px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#0c1f3d;\" colspan=\"4\"| <span style=\"color:#FFFF00;\">2018 Championship Roster</span>\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd; width:90px;\"| Goaltenders\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#29'''</small> Tynan Theobald || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#31'''</small> Jakob Doornbos || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#35'''</small> Alexandre Tetreault || {{flagicon|CAN}} <small>'''#92'''</small> Mat Hewitt\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd\"| Defencemen\n|-\n| {{flagicon|CAN}} <small>'''#4'''</small> Channing Bresciani || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#7'''</small> Bayley Kubara || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#12'''</small> Mark Rummukainen || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#17'''</small> James Byers\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#25'''</small> Matt Buskas || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#26'''</small> Darcy Flanagan || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#59'''</small> Per Daniel G\u00f6ransson || {{flagicon|NZL}} <small>'''#81'''</small> Matthew Harvey <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)|C]])'''</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd\"| Forwards\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#3'''</small> Mitchell Henning || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#6'''</small> Christopher McPhail || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#9'''</small> Wehebe Darge <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains|A]])'''</small> || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#11'''</small> David Lewis \n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#14'''</small> Jayden Lewis || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#15'''</small> Casey Kubara || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#16'''</small> Tyler Kubara || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#19'''</small> Jordan Gavin <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains|A]])'''</small>\n|-\n| {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#20'''</small> Hayden Dawes || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#24'''</small> Joseph Hughes || {{flagicon|CAN}} <small>'''#48'''</small> Chris Leveille || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#64'''</small> Kai Miettinen <small>'''([[Captain (ice hockey)#Alternate captains|A]])'''</small>\n|- style=\"border:0px;\"\n| {{flagicon|LAT}} <small>'''#66'''</small> Ainars Podzins || {{flagicon|AUS}} <small>'''#71'''</small> Jordan Brunt || {{flagicon|USA}} <small>'''#78'''</small> Trevor Gerling || \n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#dddddd\"| Coaching staff\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"| {{align|center|{{flagicon|AUS}} Robert Starke <small>'''([[Head coach]])'''</small>}} || {{align|center|{{flagicon|AUS}} Mike Sargeant <small>'''([[Assistant coach|Assistant]])'''</small>}} || {{align|center|{{flagicon|CAN}} Gordon Cocknell <small>'''([[Assistant coach|Assistant]])'''</small>}}\n|}\n\n'''<big>2019 Premiership roster</big>'''\n\nThe 2019 Brave team broke AIHL regular season records for most wins (26), most points (79), largest winning streak (17 matches), most goals scored (161), least goals conceded in a 28 match season (67) and least losses in a 28 match season (2).

During this semester, the ship circumnavigates the globe, travelling from [[North America]] and heading either east across the [[Atlantic]] or west across the [[Pacific]], visiting 10 to 11 countries in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[South America]], and [[North America]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey {{!}} Semester at Sea|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> Previously, the program had voyages that would sail through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, but due to piracy concerns in the [[Gulf of Aden]], voyages now typically travel around Africa.\n\nFor many years, ISE hosted a shorter 65-day Semester at Sea program in the summer that focused on one general region of the world. In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum based around the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn four to five transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea decided to cancel short-term voyages indefinitely due to low enrolment. Additionally, a two-week ''\"Enrichment Voyage\"'' program was previously held for continuing education participants during December and January. Itineraries for these voyages focused on [[Central America]] and [[South America]], often transiting the [[Panama Canal]] or travelling up the [[Amazon River]]. Currently, ISE only offers fall and spring voyages.\n\n== Academics ==\nStudents attend classes on a variety of subjects and disciplines while the ship is at sea. Typically, these classes include [[humanities]] classes that are relevant to one or more of the countries on the itinerary. All students are also required to take an interdisciplinary core course, called [[Global studies|Global Studies.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215223032/https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-12-15|title=Course Information|format=PDF}}</ref> While in port, no classes are held and students can travel on Semester at Sea sponsored trips or independently in the country,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/in-country/|title=In-country destinations: field classes & program {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> however, travel outside the country of a port is strictly prohibited, resulting in the student's dismissal from the program.\n\nAlthough [[Colorado State University]] is the academic sponsor for the program, Semester at Sea is open to students from any university. Faculty members are drawn from colleges and universities throughout the United States and around the world, including [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[George Washington University]], [[Boston University]], [[Bucknell University]], [[Emerson College]], [[Yale University]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[California Lutheran University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Bentley University]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[Duke University]], [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)]], [[Cornell University]], [[Jacksonville University]], [[University of Arizona]], [[University of Michigan]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Virginia]], [[University of Colorado]], [[University of Maine]], [[University of San Diego]], [[University of Southern California]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[New York University]], and [[Columbia University]].\n\nBefore arriving at a port, students receive a pre-port briefing regarding the culture and societal rules of the country they are visiting. Upon arrival at the port of call, special guest speakers, ranging from community leaders from the country to American ambassadors, give lectures to the students and faculty. The pre-port briefing and the guest lectures are intended to help prepare students for their time in the country.\n\n== Notable lecturers and guests<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/experts/|title=Faculty & Staff - your expert education team {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> ==\n*[[Fidel Castro]], Cuban President\n*[[Anwar Sadat]], Egyptian President\n*[[Indira Gandhi]], Indian Prime Minister\n*[[Mikhail Gorbachev]], USSR President\n*[[Corazon Aquino]], President of the Philippines\n*[[King Mohammed VI of Morocco]], King of Morocco\n*[[Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco]], Prince of Morocco\n*[[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Mother Teresa]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Nelson Mandela]], First Black President of South Africa, Nobel Laureate\n*[[Arthur C.

Students are transformed from \"[[Polywog|polywogs]]\" to \"shellbacks\" in an initiation ceremony, involving slime-smearing, fish-kissing, and (optional) [[head shaving|head-shaving]]. Neptune Day is one of several holidays celebrated during the voyage.\n\n=== Sea Olympics ===\nStudents aboard the ship are divided into groups named for various seas, (occasionally including [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Bering Sea|Bering]], [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Red Sea|Red]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], the [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Three Seas Initiative|Three Seas]], (for the Lifelong Learners, faculty, and children of faculty). \n\nThe student seas are generally determined by their deck and will participate in an all-day Olympic challenge. Opening ceremonies are held in the morning, and no classes are held during the challenge.

However, the ship was unable to consistently meet its sailing schedule during the semester due to persistent mechanical difficulties. The ship made several unscheduled stops and had to anchor between ports while repairs were accomplished. It was decided to tow the ship to the [[South China Sea]] and anchor overnight. Captain Chang had all crew members patrolling the deck 3\u20135 feet apart with flashlights throughout the night to notify of any pirate boarding attempts. The planned stop at [[Manila|Manila, Philippines]] was canceled and the SS ''Universe'' rerouted to Singapore. Exams completed at anchor in the harbor, then the students and faculty flew to the next two planned ports of Osaka, Japan, and Shanghai, China. The ''Universe'' then met the students in Shanghai to complete the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong.\n\nTraveling in foreign countries poses risks for all travelers and a few incidents of non-shipboard fatalities have occurred to participants of Semester at Sea. One student died in a hiking accident on a 1993 voyage, and SaS Spring 1996, five students were killed in a bus crash during a field trip in India.<ref>Hong, Peter (1996) \u201cDeaths Cloud Floating College : After Losing Children to Accidents, Parents Say Risks Weren't Publicized; Officials Defend Program\u201d,  http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/me-15911_1_international-programs.  Accessed 2011-06-30</ref>\n\nThe Fall 1997 voyage was rerouted due to [[terrorism]] concerns. On November 12, 1997, [[Ramzi Yousef]] was convicted of masterminding the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. Consequently, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] issued a travel warning for American citizens in the Middle East. On November 17, 1997, while the ship was docked in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], and the students were in [[Egypt]], the [[Luxor massacre]] occurred. Although no students were involved, fears of further terrorism resulted in the removal of the next two ports, [[Israel]] and [[Turkey]], from the itinerary, and the ship was rerouted to [[Cyprus]] and then [[Spain]].\n\nThe Fall 2000 semester on the SS ''Universe Explorer'' had two incidents. When entering Vietnam, the ship was hit by a barge, causing damage to the hull along the side of the ship and closing student rooms. No one was injured by this incident. The SS ''Universe Explorer'' had to remain an extra day in Vietnam to be patched but subsequently continued on the journey with all passengers. While preparing to head north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain, the ship's captain decided to reroute due to threats against all ships in the Suez region. Instead, the Fall 2000 voyage stopped in Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nIn the Fall 2001 semester following the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the SS ''Universe Explorer'' was redirected after its stop in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. The planned route \u2014 from [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], into the [[Indian Ocean]] through the [[Suez Canal]] to ports in [[Egypt]] and [[Croatia]] \u2014 was changed by the U.S. State Department. The ship's route for the semester was then rerouted south to include [[Singapore]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. While in the Indian Ocean, the ship's communication with other vessels in the Indian Ocean was limited to protect the security of the American citizens on board.\n\nOn January 26, 2005, the MV ''Explorer'' weathered a combination of three storms in the [[North Pacific]], and a {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} [[Rogue wave|freak wave]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Storm Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DBGhXI586k#t=8m42s|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 2005}}</ref> smashed the windows of the bridge, breaking one of them, and briefly affecting the navigation systems.

The students on board the MV ''World Odyssey'' were rerouted to Vietnam where students received an extra week to make up for lost time in China. The MV ''World Odyssey'' left [[Kobe]], Japan, as scheduled on January 28, 2020, with arrival in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]], on February 4, 2020. The ship was expected to have left [[Ho Chi Minh City]] at 0800 local time on February 16 but left 3 hours later at 1100 local time. The original itinerary had the MV ''World Odyssey'' stopping in Malaysia from February 19 to February 24 before heading to India from February 29 to March 5. Following a one-day fuel stop in Malaysia on February 19, the MV ''World Odyssey'' attempted to reroute to [[Victoria, Seychelles]] (with arrival expected on February 27 and departure on March 1). However, the evening before arrival, the Seychellois government denied the vessel entry. The MV ''World Odyssey'' then headed directly south to Mauritius and docked on February 29. The ship spent one day at port, followed by two days at sea around the island due to limited dock availability. The ship then returned to dock in [[Port Louis]] March 3\u20137. At about 0715 on March 6, students were informed of another itinerary change due to concerns of [[quarantine]] when arriving at European ports from northern Africa.

In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum based around the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn four to five transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea decided to cancel short-term voyages indefinitely due to low enrollment. Additionally, a two-week ''\"Enrichment Voyage\"'' program was previously held for continuing education participants during December and January.

In Fall 2019, Semester at Sea embarked on a new voyage that included ports such as the Netherlands, [[Poland]], the [[Kiel Canal]] Transit, [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Croatia]], Morocco, Ghana, [[Brazil]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Panama Canal]] Transit, [[Ecuador]], and [[Costa Rica]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey|website=Semester At Sea|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>\n \nThe ship docked in [[Denmark]] during Summer 2008,<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Semester at Sea \u2013 Summer 2008 Itinerary/Calendar\n |url         = http://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/current-voyage/itinerary.php\n |accessdate  = 2008-07-08\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080703042836/http://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/current-voyage/itinerary.php\n |archivedate = 2008-07-03\n}}</ref> [[Namibia]] during Fall 2008, [[Bulgaria]] during Summer 2009, and [[Senegal]] during Fall 2015, the first time in the history of the program that Semester at Sea had visited these countries.\n\n== Traditions ==\n=== Neptune Day celebration ===\nWhen the ship crosses the equator, the students, faculty and crew of the vessel celebrate [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] Day, a maritime [[line-crossing ceremony]]. Students are transformed from \"[[Polywog|polywogs]]\" to \"shellbacks\" in an initiation ceremony, involving slime-smearing, fish-kissing, and (optional) [[head shaving|head-shaving]]. Neptune Day is one of several holidays celebrated during the voyage.\n\n=== Sea Olympics ===\nStudents aboard the ship are divided into groups named for various seas, (occasionally including [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Bering Sea|Bering]], [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Red Sea|Red]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], the [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Three Seas Initiative|Three Seas]], (for the Lifelong Learners, faculty, and children of faculty). \n\nThe student seas are generally determined by their deck and will participate in an all-day Olympic challenge. Opening ceremonies are held in the morning, and no classes are held during the challenge. Events may include synchronized swimming, pull-ups, dodgeball, trivia, a lip-sync routine, and a ship-wide relay. The teams compete for the opportunity to disembark the ship first in its final port of call as well as a celebration in the faculty/staff-only lounge.\n\n==Notable Alumni==\n*[[Joan Lunden]], F67 \u2013 TV Host\n*[[Joel Douglas]], F67 \u2013 Film Producer \u2013 ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and ''[[The Jewel of the Nile]]''\n*[[Stephen Gaghan]], F86 \u2013 Emmy and Oscar Winning Screenwriter, ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''\n*[[Cynthia Nixon]], S86 \u2013 Emmy Winning Actress \u2013 \"Miranda\" on TV show ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and challenged Andrew Cuomo<ref>[[Andrew Cuomo]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} in the 2018 New York Gubernatorial Election.\n*[[Richard Lamm]], S91 \u2013 Former Governor of [[Colorado]]\n*[[Arthur C.

However, the ship was unable to consistently meet its sailing schedule during the semester due to persistent mechanical difficulties. The ship made several unscheduled stops and had to anchor between ports while repairs were accomplished. It was decided to tow the ship to the [[South China Sea]] and anchor overnight. Captain Chang had all crew members patrolling the deck 3\u20135 feet apart with flashlights throughout the night to notify of any pirate boarding attempts. The planned stop at [[Manila|Manila, Philippines]] was canceled and the SS ''Universe'' rerouted to Singapore. Exams completed at anchor in the harbor, then the students and faculty flew to the next two planned ports of Osaka, Japan, and Shanghai, China. The ''Universe'' then met the students in Shanghai to complete the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong.\n\nTraveling in foreign countries poses risks for all travelers and a few incidents of non-shipboard fatalities have occurred to participants of Semester at Sea. One student died in a hiking accident on a 1993 voyage, and SaS Spring 1996, five students were killed in a bus crash during a field trip in India.<ref>Hong, Peter (1996) \u201cDeaths Cloud Floating College : After Losing Children to Accidents, Parents Say Risks Weren't Publicized; Officials Defend Program\u201d,  http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/me-15911_1_international-programs.  Accessed 2011-06-30</ref>\n\nThe Fall 1997 voyage was rerouted due to [[terrorism]] concerns. On November 12, 1997, [[Ramzi Yousef]] was convicted of masterminding the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. Consequently, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] issued a travel warning for American citizens in the Middle East. On November 17, 1997, while the ship was docked in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], and the students were in [[Egypt]], the [[Luxor massacre]] occurred. Although no students were involved, fears of further terrorism resulted in the removal of the next two ports, [[Israel]] and [[Turkey]], from the itinerary, and the ship was rerouted to [[Cyprus]] and then [[Spain]].\n\nThe Fall 2000 semester on the SS ''Universe Explorer'' had two incidents. When entering Vietnam, the ship was hit by a barge, causing damage to the hull along the side of the ship and closing student rooms. No one was injured by this incident. The SS ''Universe Explorer'' had to remain an extra day in Vietnam to be patched but subsequently continued on the journey with all passengers. While preparing to head north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain, the ship's captain decided to reroute due to threats against all ships in the Suez region. Instead, the Fall 2000 voyage stopped in Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nIn the Fall 2001 semester following the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the SS ''Universe Explorer'' was redirected after its stop in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. The planned route \u2014 from [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], into the [[Indian Ocean]] through the [[Suez Canal]] to ports in [[Egypt]] and [[Croatia]] \u2014 was changed by the U.S. State Department. The ship's route for the semester was then rerouted south to include [[Singapore]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. While in the Indian Ocean, the ship's communication with other vessels in the Indian Ocean was limited to protect the security of the American citizens on board.\n\nOn January 26, 2005, the MV ''Explorer'' weathered a combination of three storms in the [[North Pacific]], and a {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} [[Rogue wave|freak wave]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Storm Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DBGhXI586k#t=8m42s|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 2005}}</ref> smashed the windows of the bridge, breaking one of them, and briefly affecting the navigation systems.

The students on board the MV ''World Odyssey'' were rerouted to Vietnam where students received an extra week to make up for lost time in China. The MV ''World Odyssey'' left [[Kobe]], Japan, as scheduled on January 28, 2020, with arrival in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]], on February 4, 2020. The ship was expected to have left [[Ho Chi Minh City]] at 0800 local time on February 16 but left 3 hours later at 1100 local time. The original itinerary had the MV ''World Odyssey'' stopping in Malaysia from February 19 to February 24 before heading to India from February 29 to March 5. Following a one-day fuel stop in Malaysia on February 19, the MV ''World Odyssey'' attempted to reroute to [[Victoria, Seychelles]] (with arrival expected on February 27 and departure on March 1). However, the evening before arrival, the Seychellois government denied the vessel entry. The MV ''World Odyssey'' then headed directly south to Mauritius and docked on February 29. The ship spent one day at port, followed by two days at sea around the island due to limited dock availability. The ship then returned to dock in [[Port Louis]] March 3\u20137. At about 0715 on March 6, students were informed of another itinerary change due to concerns of [[quarantine]] when arriving at European ports from northern Africa.
