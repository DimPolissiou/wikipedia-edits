He falls in love with Neeraja ([[Anushka Shetty]]), who is in Hyderabad to attend a marriage. Sathi Babu makes his way into her heart and she also starts loving him. Sathi Babu tells her the truth about him being a thief and resolves to give up crime forever. But before that, he decides to swindle one last person for a large sum of money along with his uncle Duvva ([[Brahmanandam]]). He tricks a woman in a bus stand and flees with a trunk. This leads Sathi Babu to Neha (Baby Neha), a young girl who was in the trunk instead of the wealth he thought was in the trunk, who thinks that Sathi Babu is her father. Flummoxed by what is happening, but forced to keep Neha with her as a police officer Inspector Mahanti ([[Rajiv Kanakala]]) keeps his eye on him.\n \nAlthough he tries keeping Neha away from Neeraja\u2019s eyes, the latter finds out about Neha. Angry and hurt, Neeraja leaves for her place leaving Sathi Babu heartbroken. Soon, unknown goons attack him, taking him to be  superintendent of Police, Vikram Rathore (also Ravi Teja), Neha\u2019s real father. Rathore looks exactly like Sathi Babu, which had caused all the confusion. While many unknown people help Sathi Babu run to safety with Neha in his arms, he is soon surrounded by the goons. It is then that Rathore makes an appearance and saves the day killing every goon by himself, but he soon dies suffering from injuries.\n \nThe other policemen who had assisted the SP then inform Sathi Babu of the whole incident. In Chambal village of Devgarh, Madhya Pradesh, the slain, and corrupt local [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|M. L. A.]] Bavuji ([[Vineet Kumar]]), a borderline psychopath, engulfs the town with his political corruption, illegal activities, criminal nexus, rape, and money laundering. His son Munna ([[Amit Tiwari]]) indulges in abusing women, and raping the wives of policemen. Rathore immediately arrests him and also makes him mentally insane. Munna humiliates police by removing their clothes but was killed by Rathod when he was hung from a tree by the belt of a humiliated inspector. Rathore was attacked by Bavuji's brother Titla ([[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]]) on Holi where he was stabbed from the back as well as shot in the head while trying to save a village child and was assumed to be dead. But he survives with a brain injury although the goons assumed that he is dead. Effects of this brain injury are later visible and these effects are diminished by water falling on his head.\n \nSathi Babu then adopts Neha, who does not know that her father is dead. Then Sathi Babu returns to Devgarh posing as Rathore, and heads to settle the scores with Bavuji. Duvva tells Neeraja the truth and she forgives Sathi Babu. Sathi Babu, being a goon, handles Bavuji well with tricks. He sets the MLA's wine factory afire and makes the villagers rob his food store. In the ensuing fight, he single-handedly defeats all of Bavuji's men. In the end, he fights with Titla on a rope bridge. Sathi Babu ties and cuts the rope and Titla falls to death. Sathi Babu marries Neeraja, and they leave for a new life with Neha and Duvva.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ravi Teja]] as Athili Sathi Babu / ASP Vikram Singh Rathore IPS (double role)\n* [[Anushka Shetty]] as Neeraja Goswami\n* [[Ruthika]] as Sub-inspector Razia\n* [[Vineet Kumar]] as Bavuji, MLA\n* [[Amit Tiwari]] as Bavuji's son\n* Abdul Rehman as Bavuji's Henchman\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as Duvva Abbulu\n* Baby Neha as Neha\n* [[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]] as Titla\n* [[Rajiv Kanakala]] as Inspector Mahanti\n* [[Raghu Babu]] as Bavuji\u2019s brother-in-law\n* [[Jaya Prakash Reddy]] as Home Minister\n* [[Madhuri Sen]] as Inspector Mahanti's wife\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as DGP (guest appearance)\n* [[Jyothika]] as wife of Vikram  Rathore (in portrait)\n* [[Meghna Naidu]] as [[item number|Item girl]] in song \"Vastavaa\"\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\nThe shooting was disrupted by quarry workers started pelting the film\u2019s unit with stones, damaging most of the equipment and injuring some of the film crew including director [[S.

{"title_page": "Cathedral Peak Granodiorite", "text_new": "[[Image:MatterhornPeakCA.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Matterhorn Peak]] consists of Cathedral Peak Granodiorite]]\n\nThe '''Cathedral Peak Granodiorite''' ('''CPG''') was named after its type locality, [[Cathedral Peak (California)|Cathedral Peak]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], [[California]]. The [[granodiorite]] forms part of the [[Tuolumne Intrusive Suite]] (Tuolumne Batholith), one of the four major [[intrusive suites]] within the [[Sierra Nevada (California)|Sierra Nevada]]. It has been assigned [[Radiometric dating|radiometric ages]] between 88 and 87 million years and therefore reached its cooling stage in the [[Coniacian]] (Upper Cretaceous).\n\n== Geographic situation ==\n[[Image:Cathedral Range.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Cathedral Range]] is shaped from Cathedral Peak Granodiorite.]]\nThe Cathedral Peak Granodiorite forms part of the central eastern Sierra Nevada in California. It is exposed in glaciated outcrops from the upper Yosemite Valley into the high Sierra Divide. It covers large parts of [[Mariposa County]] and [[Tuolumne County]] and also touches [[Madera County]] and [[Mono County]]. At its northern end it includes [[Tower Peak (California)|Tower Peak]] and [[Matterhorn Peak]], at 12,264 feet (3743 m) its highest elevation. In its southwestern section rises the [[Cathedral Range]] with the 10,911 feet [[Cathedral Peak (California)|Cathedral Peak]] (3326 m) above [[Tuolumne Meadows]]. [[California State Route 120]] traverses the granodiorite in its southern half. Due to the block-faulting and tilting of the Sierra Nevada to the west its drainage system is oriented to the west and follows mainly southwesterly courses, especially in the northern section.\n\nThe shape of the intrusion is a drawn-out rectangle or ellipse oriented roughly in the NNW-SSE-direction. Its long dimension measures about {{convert|30|mi|km}}, its width hardly reaches {{convert|12|mi|km}} at the northern end. The surface area amounts to about {{convert|230|mi2|km2}}, roughly half of the total area of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite. The granodiorite completely engulfes the [[Johnson Granite Porphyry]] in the south. It is surrounded in the southeast, southwest and northwest by the [[Half Dome Granodiorite]]. In its central belt region it touches the [[Kuna Crest Granodiorite]]. In the north and northeast it comes into contact with weakly [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] [[Country rock (geology)|country rock]]s, mainly [[Paleozoic]] and [[Jurassic]] [[metavolcanic]]s and [[metasediment]]s.\n\n== Geological overview ==\n[[File:Map of Cathedral Peak Granodiorite.svg|thumb|350px|Geologic map of the [[Yosemite National Park]]: {{legend|#fbede5|Cathedral Peak Granodiorite}}]]\nThe Cathedral Peak Granodiorite is the third and most important intrusive pulse of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite. The intrusions of this magmatic suite were spaced out over quite a long period. They started in the [[Turonian]] at about 93.5 million years BP and lasted right to the beginning of the [[Santonian]] at 85.4 million years BP. Radiometric dating of the cooling ages of the Cathedral Peak Granodiorite yielded 88.1 \u00b1 0.2 down to 87.0 \u00b1 0.7 million years BP, i.e. [[Coniacian]].\n\nThe Tuolumne Intrusive Suite is accompanied by other major intrusive complexes in the Sierra Nevada: the [[John Muir Intrusive Suite|John Muir]] and [[Mount Whitney Intrusive Suite|Mount Whitney]] intrusive suites, both further south and the [[Sonora Plutonic Complex]] to the north.  The surface area of these four complexes surpasses {{convert|970|mi2|km2}}.\n\nThe Tuolumne Intrusive Suite was constructed over a long time span of 8.1 million years by the following magmatic pulses (ordered by increasing age):\n* Johnson Granite Porphyry\n* Cathedral Peak Granodiorite\n* Half Dome Granodiorite, further subdivided into a porphyritic and an equigranular facies\n* Kuna Crest Granodiorite \u2013 [[quartz diorite]] and [[granodiorite]]\nThis magmatic sequence shows the following geochronological and geochemical trends:\n* decreasing age from the margin to the center, with the marginal Kuna Crest Granodiorte being the oldest magmatic pulse and the central Johnson Granite Porphyry the youngest.\n* an increase in silica and alkali contents from rim to center, the composition of the rocks changing from [[mafic]]/intermediate to more [[felsic]] compositions.\n* an increase in [[rubidium]] contents from rim to center.\n* a steady decrease in Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, FeO, MgO and CaO contents.\n* a decrease in [[barium]], [[strontium]] and [[LREE|light rare earth elements]] such as [[scandium]].\n\n== Petrological description ==\nThe immediately apparent trait of the grey-white Cathedral Peak Granodiorite is its [[porphyritic]] habit with very large megacrysts of [[alkali feldspar]] commonly reaching 10, occasionally even 20 centimeters. The grain size of the groundmass stays in the 5 millimeter range.\n\n=== Mineralogy ===\nThe Cathedral Peak Granodiorite is modally composed of the following minerals:\n* [[plagioclase]] \u2013 47.5 volume percent. Present as subhedral to euhedral, tabular [[oligoclase]] with An<sub>27\u201329</sub>. Shows normal zoning with [[calcium]]-rich cores and [[sodium]]-rich rims. Exhibits simple carlsbad and albite [[Crystal twinning|twinning]]. Grain size varies between 1 and 15 millimeters. Can be [[cataclastic rock|cataclastically]] broken and infiltrated/replaced by [[microcline]] in shear zone.\n* [[alkali feldspar]] \u2013 20.9 volume percent. Present as blocky, [[Perthite|perthitic]] [[orthoclase]] with Or<sub>88</sub>. [[Phenocryst]]s with grain sizes up to 20 centimeters in length, normal range up to 10 centimeters, 2 centimeters wide. Exhibit carlsbad twinning. Grain size and abundance of the phenocrysts decreases inwards towards the Johnson Granite Porphyry. The megacrysts engulf ([[poikilitic]]ally enclose) other smaller minerals such as biotite, hornblende,  plagioclase and alkali feldspar due to a rapid growth rate. Cracks have been filled with opaque minerals, bigger fractures are in-filled with groundmass material. The surface is fractured with irregular edges. Some grains show signs of secondary alteration to [[clay mineral]]s. Alkali feldspar occurs interstitially also in the fine- to medium-grained [[matrix (geology)|groundmass]].\n* [[quartz]] \u2013 25.9 volume percent. Equidimensional subhedral crystals of medium grain size (10 millimeter).\n* [[biotite]] \u2013 3.5 volume percent. Equidimensional and subhedral. Main [[mafic]] constituent. Shows strong brown [[pleochroism]], occasionally with [[pleochroic halo]]s.\n* [[hornblende]] \u2013 0.8 volume percent.\n* [[apatite]] \u2013 0.3 volume percent. Prismatic crystals.\n* [[titanite]]. Irregular fine-grained crystals. Can appear in euhedral habit.\n* opaque ore minerals such as [[ilmenite]] and [[magnetite]] \u2013 0.6 volume percent.\n* accessories such as [[allanite]] and [[zircon]].\n* [[myrmekite]] in shear zone.\n\n=== Chemical composition ===\nThe following analyses by Bateman & Chappell<ref>Bateman, P.C. & Chappell, B.W.

Two [[magmatic foliations]] can be observed:\n** a major NNW-SSE-striking, steeply dipping foliation bearing a steep lineation.\n** a secondary ESE-WNW-striking foliation.\n* [[Schlieren]] generally strike NNW-SSE (N 157 \u2013 with local deviations up to 50 \u00b0) and show a fairly steep dip of about 60 \u00b0 to the ENE.\n* [[Ladder dike]]s represent tubular, locally confined magmatic upwellings. These structures are sometimes displaced by later magmatic motions.\n* Microgranitoid [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]]s are similar in their mineralogy to the host rock, yet contain a higher percentage of mafic minerals like hornblende and biotite. Phenocrysts are plagioclase and hornblende with a grain size of 5 to 8 millimeter. The inclusions are sometimes surrounded by up to 3 centimeter wide felsic rims. Their mode of occurrence is singular or in clusters without a preferred direction.\n* [[Aplite]]s form one to three centimeter wide dykes. Their mineralogy is fine-grained and homogeneous. They cut through all other structures with mostly sharp contacts. Larger dykes can host pegmatitic cores of quartz, plagioclase and alkali feldspar. Smaller splaying dyke terminations can end in a diffuse fashion in the host rock.\n* [[Displacement (vector)|Displacement]]s in the magmatic state which can affect schlieren, ladder dykes and also the homogeneous granodiorite. They are later healed by aplitic material and concentrations of alkali feldspar. Displacements in schlieren are flat-lying, obliquely sinistral and show top to the WSW motion.\n\nStructures that imply [[Tectonics|tectonic]] movements are signs of [[cataclastic rock|cataclasis]]:\n* on magmatic plagioclases\n* on [[Matrix (geology)|groundmass]] minerals like quartz\n* along the edges of microcline phenocrysts\nStructures that strongly hint at later-stage [[metasomatism|metasomatic]] changes are:\n* [[myrmekite]]\n* substitution of primary plagioclase by microcline\nTaken together all these structural phenomena reveal a very complex evolution of the Cathedral Peak Granodiorite showing the succession of magmatic, tectonic and metasomatic stages \u2013 and most likely their occasional synergy and interdependence.\n\n== Formation and origin ==\n[[Image:Plagioclase Replacement.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Thin section]] view of cataclastically broken, albite-twinned plagioclase is invaded by microcline]]\n\nOriginally petrologists favoured a single [[magma chamber]] model for the genesis of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite which underwent [[fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallization]] and successively produced the different rock types like the Cathedral Peak Granodiorite. This somewhat simplistic model is now being questioned as underlined by the following facts:\n* the extremely long activity of this magma chamber protracted over 8.1 million years.<ref>Coleman, D.S., Gray, W. & Glazner, A.F.

The geochemical parameters of the two granodiorites also overlap, differences are mainly textural. They form a continuum and therefore cannot be clearly separated as two distinctive intrusive pulses.<ref>Gray, W., Glazner, A.F., Coleman, D.S. & Bartley, J.M. (2008).

The [[granodiorite]] forms part of the [[Tuolumne Intrusive Suite]] (Tuolumne Batholith), one of the four major [[intrusive suites]] within the [[Sierra Nevada (California)|Sierra Nevada]]. It has been assigned [[Radiometric dating|radiometric ages]] between 88 and 87 million years and therefore reached its cooling stage in the [[Coniacian]] (Upper Cretaceous).\n\n== Geographic situation ==\n[[Image:Cathedral Range.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Cathedral Range]] is shaped from Cathedral Peak Granodiorite.]]\nThe Cathedral Peak Granodiorite forms part of the central eastern Sierra Nevada in California. It is exposed in glaciated outcrops from the upper Yosemite Valley into the high Sierra Divide. It covers large parts of [[Mariposa County]] and [[Tuolumne County]] and also touches [[Madera County]] and [[Mono County]]. At its northern end it includes [[Tower Peak (California)|Tower Peak]] and [[Matterhorn Peak]], at 12,264 feet (3743 m) its highest elevation. In its southwestern section rises the [[Cathedral Range]] with the 10,911 feet [[Cathedral Peak (California)|Cathedral Peak]] (3326 m) above [[Tuolumne Meadows]]. [[California State Route 120]] traverses the granodiorite in its southern half. Due to the block-faulting and tilting of the Sierra Nevada to the west its drainage system is oriented to the west and follows mainly southwesterly courses, especially in the northern section.\n\nThe shape of the intrusion is a drawn-out rectangle or ellipse oriented roughly in the NNW-SSE-direction. Its long dimension measures about {{convert|30|mi|km}}, its width hardly reaches {{convert|12|mi|km}} at the northern end. The surface area amounts to about {{convert|230|mi2|km2}}, roughly half of the total area of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite. The granodiorite completely engulfes the [[Johnson Granite Porphyry]] in the south. It is surrounded in the southeast, southwest and northwest by the [[Half Dome Granodiorite]]. In its central belt region it touches the [[Kuna Crest Granodiorite]]. In the north and northeast it comes into contact with weakly [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] [[Country rock (geology)|country rock]]s, mainly [[Paleozoic]] and [[Jurassic]] [[metavolcanic]]s and [[metasediment]]s.\n\n== Geological overview ==\n[[File:Map of Cathedral Peak Granodiorite.svg|thumb|350px|Geologic map of the [[Yosemite National Park]]: {{legend|#fbede5|Cathedral Peak Granodiorite}}]]\nThe Cathedral Peak Granodiorite is the third and most important intrusive pulse of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite. The intrusions of this magmatic suite were spaced out over quite a long period. They started in the [[Turonian]] at about 93.5 million years BP and lasted right to the beginning of the [[Santonian]] at 85.4 million years BP. Radiometric dating of the cooling ages of the Cathedral Peak Granodiorite yielded 88.1 \u00b1 0.2 down to 87.0 \u00b1 0.7 million years BP, i.e. [[Coniacian]].\n\nThe Tuolumne Intrusive Suite is accompanied by other major intrusive complexes in the Sierra Nevada: the [[John Muir Intrusive Suite|John Muir]] and [[Mount Whitney Intrusive Suite|Mount Whitney]] intrusive suites, both further south and the [[Sonora Plutonic Complex]] to the north.  The surface area of these four complexes surpasses {{convert|970|mi2|km2}}.\n\nThe Tuolumne Intrusive Suite was constructed over a long time span of 8.1 million years by the following magmatic pulses (ordered by increasing age):\n* Johnson Granite Porphyry\n* Cathedral Peak Granodiorite\n* Half Dome Granodiorite, further subdivided into a porphyritic and an equigranular facies\n* Kuna Crest Granodiorite \u2013 [[quartz diorite]] and [[granodiorite]]\nThis magmatic sequence shows the following geochronological and geochemical trends:\n* decreasing age from the margin to the center, with the marginal Kuna Crest Granodiorte being the oldest magmatic pulse and the central Johnson Granite Porphyry the youngest.\n* an increase in silica and alkali contents from rim to center, the composition of the rocks changing from [[mafic]]/intermediate to more [[felsic]] compositions.\n* an increase in [[rubidium]] contents from rim to center.\n* a steady decrease in Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, FeO, MgO and CaO contents.\n* a decrease in [[barium]], [[strontium]] and [[LREE|light rare earth elements]] such as [[scandium]].\n\n== Petrological description ==\nThe immediately apparent trait of the grey-white Cathedral Peak Granodiorite is its [[porphyritic]] habit with very large megacrysts of [[alkali feldspar]] commonly reaching 10, occasionally even 20 centimeters. The grain size of the groundmass stays in the 5 millimeter range.\n\n=== Mineralogy ===\nThe Cathedral Peak Granodiorite is modally composed of the following minerals:\n* [[plagioclase]] \u2013 47.5 volume percent. Present as subhedral to euhedral, tabular [[oligoclase]] with An<sub>27\u201329</sub>. Shows normal zoning with [[calcium]]-rich cores and [[sodium]]-rich rims. Exhibits simple carlsbad and albite [[Crystal twinning|twinning]]. Grain size varies between 1 and 15 millimeters. Can be [[cataclastic rock|cataclastically]] broken and infiltrated/replaced by [[microcline]] in shear zone.\n* [[alkali feldspar]] \u2013 20.9 volume percent. Present as blocky, [[Perthite|perthitic]] [[orthoclase]] with Or<sub>88</sub>. [[Phenocryst]]s with grain sizes up to 20 centimeters in length, normal range up to 10 centimeters, 2 centimeters wide. Exhibit carlsbad twinning. Grain size and abundance of the phenocrysts decreases inwards towards the Johnson Granite Porphyry. The megacrysts engulf ([[poikilitic]]ally enclose) other smaller minerals such as biotite, hornblende,  plagioclase and alkali feldspar due to a rapid growth rate. Cracks have been filled with opaque minerals, bigger fractures are in-filled with groundmass material. The surface is fractured with irregular edges. Some grains show signs of secondary alteration to [[clay mineral]]s. Alkali feldspar occurs interstitially also in the fine- to medium-grained [[matrix (geology)|groundmass]].\n* [[quartz]] \u2013 25.9 volume percent. Equidimensional subhedral crystals of medium grain size (10 millimeter).\n* [[biotite]] \u2013 3.5 volume percent. Equidimensional and subhedral. Main [[mafic]] constituent. Shows strong brown [[pleochroism]], occasionally with [[pleochroic halo]]s.\n* [[hornblende]] \u2013 0.8 volume percent.\n* [[apatite]] \u2013 0.3 volume percent. Prismatic crystals.\n* [[titanite]]. Irregular fine-grained crystals. Can appear in euhedral habit.\n* opaque ore minerals such as [[ilmenite]] and [[magnetite]] \u2013 0.6 volume percent.\n* accessories such as [[allanite]] and [[zircon]].\n* [[myrmekite]] in shear zone.\n\n=== Chemical composition ===\nThe following analyses by Bateman & Chappell<ref>Bateman, P.C. & Chappell, B.W.

Two [[magmatic foliations]] can be observed:\n** a major NNW-SSE-striking, steeply dipping foliation bearing a steep lineation.\n** a secondary ESE-WNW-striking foliation.\n* [[Schlieren]] generally strike NNW-SSE (N 157 \u2013 with local deviations up to 50 \u00b0) and show a fairly steep dip of about 60 \u00b0 to the ENE.\n* [[Ladder dike]]s represent tubular, locally confined magmatic upwellings. These structures are sometimes displaced by later magmatic motions.\n* Microgranitoid [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]]s are similar in their mineralogy to the host rock, yet contain a higher percentage of mafic minerals like hornblende and biotite. Phenocrysts are plagioclase and hornblende with a grain size of 5 to 8 millimeter. The inclusions are sometimes surrounded by up to 3 centimeter wide felsic rims. Their mode of occurrence is singular or in clusters without a preferred direction.\n* [[Aplite]]s form one to three centimeter wide dykes. Their mineralogy is fine-grained and homogeneous. They cut through all other structures with mostly sharp contacts. Larger dykes can host pegmatitic cores of quartz, plagioclase and alkali feldspar. Smaller splaying dyke terminations can end in a diffuse fashion in the host rock.\n* [[Displacement (vector)|Displacement]]s in the magmatic state which can affect schlieren, ladder dykes and also the homogeneous granodiorite. They are later healed by aplitic material and concentrations of alkali feldspar. Displacements in schlieren are flat-lying, obliquely sinistral and show top to the WSW motion.\n\nStructures that imply [[Tectonics|tectonic]] movements are signs of [[cataclastic rock|cataclasis]]:\n* on magmatic plagioclases\n* on [[Matrix (geology)|groundmass]] minerals like quartz\n* along the edges of microcline phenocrysts\nStructures that strongly hint at later-stage [[metasomatism|metasomatic]] changes are:\n* [[myrmekite]]\n* substitution of primary plagioclase by microcline\nTaken together all these structural phenomena reveal a very complex evolution of the Cathedral Peak Granodiorite showing the succession of magmatic, tectonic and metasomatic stages \u2013 and most likely their occasional synergy and interdependence.\n\n== Formation and origin ==\n[[Image:Plagioclase Replacement.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Thin section]] view of cataclastically broken, albite-twinned plagioclase is invaded by microcline]]\n\nOriginally petrologists favoured a single [[magma chamber]] model for the genesis of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite which underwent [[fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallization]] and successively produced the different rock types like the Cathedral Peak Granodiorite. This somewhat simplistic model is now being questioned as underlined by the following facts:\n* the extremely long activity of this magma chamber protracted over 8.1 million years.<ref>Coleman, D.S., Gray, W. & Glazner, A.F. (2004). Rethinking the emplacement and evolution of zoned plutons: geochronologic evidence for incremental assembly of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite, California. Geology, 32, 433\u2013436.</ref>\n* inconsistencies in the distribution of the [[trace element]]s and in the initial [[isotope ratio]]s of [[strontium]] and [[neodymium]].<ref>Kistler, R.W., Chappell, B.W., Peck, D.L. & Bateman, P.C. (1986). Isotopic variation in the Tuolumne intrusive suite, central Sierra Nevada, California. Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology, 94, 205\u2013220.</ref>\n\nIsotope ratios favour the mixing of two magmas, one with [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] affinities and another one with more felsic compositions approaching the Johnson Granite Porphyry in composition.\n\n[[Thermobarometry|Thermobarometric]] data document an intrusion depth of 6 kilometers and a [[crystallization]] temperature range between 750 and 660&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nFeldspars, hornblende, biotite and magnetite often show unmixing in the lower temperature subsolidus region.\n\nThe Cathedral Peak Granodiorite cannot always be clearly distinguished from the porphyritic Half Dome Granodiorite in the field, at some places it shows gradual merging over about a hundred meters and apophyses are observed branching into the Half Dome rocks. The geochemical parameters of the two granodiorites also overlap, differences are mainly textural. They form a continuum and therefore cannot be clearly separated as two distinctive intrusive pulses.<ref>Gray, W., Glazner, A.F., Coleman, D.S. & Bartley, J.M. (2008).

Geologic and geophysical investigation of two fine-grained granites, Sierra Nevada Batholith, California; evidence for structural controls on emplacement and volcanism. Geological Society of America Bulletin, 117, 1256\u20131271.</ref>\n\nThe origin of the microcline in shear zones poses another problem. M.D. Higgins favours the possibility of recrystallization based on [[Ostwald ripening]] via [[Metasomatism|metasomatic]] fluids.<ref>Higgins, M. D. (1999). Ostwald ripening: in Understanding Granites: Integrating Modern and Classical Techniques, Castro, A., Fernandez, C. and Vigneresse, J.

K-metasomatism of plagioclase to produce microcline megacrysts in a shear zone of the Cathedral Peak granodiorite, Sierra Nevada, California, USA</ref>  To be fully effective this process is dependent on the cataclastic breaking-up of the original crystals as realized in a ductile [[shear zone]] along the eastern edge of the Cathedral Peak Granodiorite (Gem Lake Shear Zone).\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[El Capitan Granite]]\n* [[Geology of the Yosemite area]]\n* [[Half Dome Granodiorite]]\n* [[Kuna Crest Granodiorite]]\n* [[Sentinel granodiorite]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/i2697/i2697.pdf Geologic map of the Tower Peak Quadrangle (northwest corner of the Cathedral Peak Granodiorite)]; PDF file, 7,27 MB.\n\n[[Category:Igneous petrology of California]]\n[[Category:Geology of Yosemite National Park]]\n[[Category:Cretaceous magmatism]]\n", "name_user": "Cobham1", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed refs", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_Peak_Granodiorite"}

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012.\n\nApple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive and idiosyncratic sound, lyrically exploring freedom from oppression and Apple's relationships with women.\n\nThe album was released during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]], and many critics found its exploration of confinement pertinent. It received universal critical acclaim, and is currently the highest-rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> As well as Apple's home, recording sessions took place at Stanley Recordings and at engineer [[Dave Way]]'s private studio, Waystation.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n===Musical style===\nThe album's sound is defined by percussion.

The unpredictable songs feature looped sections, sudden stops and tempo changes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\".<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> It has been noted as less melancholy than Apple's past work, with the uptempo songs being described as \"funny, angry, and at times triumphant\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> The album features frequent improvisation, as well as background noise such as the barking of dogs, largely as a result of its home recording. Apple's dog Mercy appears on the album, as well as [[Cara Delevigne]]'s Leo and Alfie, and Zelda Hallman's Maddie.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: \"I have fun with my voice, but I\u2019m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\u2019m not trying to convince anybody I\u2019m a singer. It just turned out to be another instrument\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Breihan noted that Apple demonstrates \"a [[rapper]]\u2019s sense that words can be music\",<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> while ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Laura Barton]] highlighted the intimacy of Apple's vocals: \"half-conversational, half-self-mutters, allowing every scuff, breath and feral yelp\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found that \"whether she\u2019s cooing with sarcastic solicitousness or rasping close to a scream, she articulates every word clearly, emoting but never losing control\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\nThe album defies genre categorisation, and critics have noted its originality.<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-homemade-insight-of-fetch-the-bolt-cutters|title=The Homemade Insight of Fiona Apple\u2019s \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters\"|last=Battan|first=Carrie|date=April 18, 2020|website=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> Nevertheless, it has been compared to the works of [[Joni Mitchell]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Tom Waits]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Nina Simone]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/> and [[Kate Bush]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> who is quoted on the title track.<ref name=\"Observer\"/>\n\n===Lyrics and themes===\nLyrically, Apple identified the album's main theme as \"not being afraid to speak,\"<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> with Barton similarly recognising \"a refusal to be silenced\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Apple later said that this was an oversimplification, elaborating that \"it's about breaking out of whatever prison you\u2019ve allowed yourself to live in,\" and pinpointing the message as: \"Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\u2019re in\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Pareles found that the album explored \"both past and present injuries: bullying, sexual assault, destructive mind games, romantic debacles, [Apple's] own fears and compulsions and the people who have taken advantage of them\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The album explores freedom,<ref name=\"Observer\"/> with Breihan writing that \"we can hear the euphoria of a great unburdening\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> The album has also been identified as Apple's most humorous album.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nAnother theme Apple explores on the album are her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple commented that these relationships began to suffer in middle school,<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> and the album features Apple trying to make peace \"the sorts of women that society has always deemed her 'competition'\", such as subsequent girlfriends of her exes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> Apple summarised this idea as \"not letting men pit us against each other or keep us separate from each other so they can control the message\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At the start of April, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref> [[Epic Records]] had planned to release the album in October, due to promotional limitations brought by the [[impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage|coronavirus pandemic]].

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012.\n\nApple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive and idiosyncratic sound, lyrically exploring freedom from oppression and Apple's relationships with women.\n\nThe album was released during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]], and many critics found its exploration of confinement pertinent. It received universal critical acclaim, and is currently the highest-rated album of all time on review aggregator [[Metacritic]].\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> As well as Apple's home, recording sessions took place at Stanley Recordings and at engineer [[Dave Way]]'s private studio, Waystation.<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n===Musical style===\nThe album's sound is defined by percussion.

The unpredictable songs feature looped sections, sudden stops and tempo changes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\".<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> It has been noted as less melancholy than Apple's past work, with the uptempo songs being described as \"funny, angry, and at times triumphant\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> The album features frequent improvisation, as well as background noise such as the barking of dogs, largely as a result of its home recording. Apple's dog Mercy appears on the album, as well as [[Cara Delevigne]]'s Leo and Alfie, and Zelda Hallman's Maddie.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: \"I have fun with my voice, but I\u2019m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\u2019m not trying to convince anybody I\u2019m a singer. It just turned out to be another instrument\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Breihan noted that Apple demonstrates \"a [[rapper]]\u2019s sense that words can be music\",<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> while ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Laura Barton]] highlighted the intimacy of Apple's vocals: \"half-conversational, half-self-mutters, allowing every scuff, breath and feral yelp\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found that \"whether she\u2019s cooing with sarcastic solicitousness or rasping close to a scream, she articulates every word clearly, emoting but never losing control\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\nThe album defies genre categorisation, and critics have noted its originality.<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-homemade-insight-of-fetch-the-bolt-cutters|title=The Homemade Insight of Fiona Apple\u2019s \"Fetch the Bolt Cutters\"|last=Battan|first=Carrie|date=April 18, 2020|website=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> Nevertheless, it has been compared to the works of [[Joni Mitchell]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Tom Waits]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"Observer\"/> [[Nina Simone]],<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"LA Times\"/> and [[Kate Bush]],<ref name=\"The Times\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> who is quoted on the title track.<ref name=\"Observer\"/>\n\n===Lyrics and themes===\nLyrically, Apple identified the album's main theme as \"not being afraid to speak,\"<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> with Barton similarly recognising \"a refusal to be silenced\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Apple later said that this was an oversimplification, elaborating that \"it's about breaking out of whatever prison you\u2019ve allowed yourself to live in,\" and pinpointing the message as: \"Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\u2019re in\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> Pareles found that the album explored \"both past and present injuries: bullying, sexual assault, destructive mind games, romantic debacles, [Apple's] own fears and compulsions and the people who have taken advantage of them\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> The album explores freedom,<ref name=\"Observer\"/> with Breihan writing that \"we can hear the euphoria of a great unburdening\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> The album has also been identified as Apple's most humorous album.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nAnother theme Apple explores on the album are her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> Apple commented that these relationships began to suffer in middle school,<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> and the album features Apple trying to make peace \"the sorts of women that society has always deemed her 'competition'\", such as subsequent girlfriends of her exes.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> Apple summarised this idea as \"not letting men pit us against each other or keep us separate from each other so they can control the message\".<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At the start of April, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref> [[Epic Records]] had planned to release the album in October, due to promotional limitations brought by the [[impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on the arts and cultural heritage|coronavirus pandemic]].

Apple sent him a photo she had taken of herself \"two or three\" years earlier, and saved as a potential cover photo. On the choice of photograph, she commented: \"That face is very much me. I just wanted to be like, 'Hey, guess what? I\u2019m back! Here are some songs. Want to listen to the music, huh? Hi, hi, hi, hi.'\"<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/>\n\nThe title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| AOTY = 95/100<ref name=\"aoty\">{{cite web |title=Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Reviews |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/224348-fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.php |publisher=Album of The Year |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| ADM = 9.0/10<ref name=\"adm\">{{cite web |title=Fetch The Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple reviews|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/11368/Fiona-Apple-Fetch-The-Bolt-Cutters.aspx |publisher=[[AnyDecentMusic?]] |accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 100/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/fetch-the-bolt-cutters/fiona-apple|title=Fetch the Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple Reviews and Tracks|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.

Report of the Standing Committee on National Defence. Rick Casson, MP, Chair. Retrieved on: 10 December 2011.</ref> At the [[2012 NATO Summit]] in [[Chicago]], Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] announced that an undisclosed number of Canadian soldiers would remain in the country to help train and mentor the [[Afghan National Army]] until 12 March 2014 (though Canadian troops ended their combat role there in 2011).\n\nIn September 2001 after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]], [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] [[Art Eggleton]] advised [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] to authorize more than 100 Canadian Forces members serving on [[Exchange officer|military exchange programs]] in the United States and other countries to participate in U.S. operations in Afghanistan. Eggleton summed up the dominant thinking in the government at the time when he said, \"Any Canadian military deployment to Afghanistan may well be similar to a situation in Eritrea and Ethiopia where we went in on the first wave, we helped establish the stabilization, the basis for ongoing peace support operations that would come after ... but then turned it over to somebody else.\"<ref>{{harvp|Stein|Lang|2008}}</ref> The operations were aimed at identifying and neutralizing [[al-Qaeda]] members in that country, as well as toppling the [[Taliban]] regime, which was supporting international terrorism.\n\n==Canadian experience in nation-building and sector reform==\n\n{{tone|date=April 2014}}\nIn post-Cold War conflicts, Canada \"experienced a steep\u2014and at times bloody\u2014learning curve as it tried to develop new techniques to contain violence and restore functioning civil societies.\"<ref>{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008}}</ref> After a 15-hour firefight in [[Croatia]] involving Canadian troops at a site known as the [[Medak Pocket]], it became clear that the rules of engagement had to allow that what were defined initially as \"peacekeeping forces had to be able to make that rapid tactical transition. It meant that they had to be allowed to take the offensive in combat just as much as they were for peacekeeping.\"<ref>{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008|p=14}}</ref> This notion is reflected in the training and professionalism of the Canadian army mentioned later on the page. Moving to Bosnia, [[Somalia]], and [[Haiti]] a new peacekeeping partnership began to form. It required the assistance of soldiers and development organizations working closely to achieve their rebuilding goals. These peacekeeping initiatives carried out by \"Canadians and other NATO troops in Bosnia and elsewhere in the post-Cold War conflicts are similar and relevant to what they are carrying out in Afghanistan. In many respects the peace-building in Kandahar is just one more example of the 'new normal.'\"<ref>{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008|p=16}}</ref>\n\n==2001\u20132002: initial deployment==\n\nGeneral [[Ray Henault]], the [[Chief of the Defense Staff (Canada)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], issued preliminary orders to several CF units, as [[Operation Apollo]] was established. The Canadian commitment was originally planned to last to October 2003.\n\nApproximately 40 [[Joint Task Force 2]] (JTF2) assaulters were sent to southern Afghanistan in early December 2001, although the Canadian public was not informed of the deployment, following the American declaration of a War on Terror. Sean M. Maloney's book ''Enduring the Freedom'', however, reported that JTF2 was secretly deployed without Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien's knowledge in early October 2001.<ref name=\"afghanistan2005\"/> (In October 2004, these JTF2 personnel received the [[US Navy Presidential Unit Citation]] as part of [[Task Force K-Bar]], a multinational special-operations task force led by the [[US Navy SEAL]]s that was decorated for its operations during the period 17 October 2001 through 30 March 2002.)\n\nRegular forces arrived in Kandahar in January\u2013February 2002. In March 2002, three [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] [[sniper]]s fought alongside [[U.S. Army]] units during [[Operation Anaconda]]. In the operation the team broke, and re-broke, the [[Rob Furlong|kill record for a long distance sniper kill]] set in the [[Vietnam War]] by a U.S. Marine, Staff Sergeant [[Carlos Hathcock]].<ref>{{cite web|authorlink=Michael Friscolanti|url=http://www.macleans.ca/canada/national/article.jsp?content=20060515_126689_126689 |author=Friscolanti, Michael|title=We were abandoned|publisher=Macleans, Rogers Publishing|pages=18\u201325 |website=Macleans.ca |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |accessdate=24 March 2008 |date=April 2007 |publisher=Stupid Beaver |title=World longest distance kill \u2013 2,430 metres (1.5 miles) |url=http://stupidbeaver.com/world-longest-distance-kill-2430-metres15-miles/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322063243/http://stupidbeaver.com/world-longest-distance-kill-2430-metres15-miles/ |archivedate=22 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Operation Anaconda was also the first time since the [[Korean War]] that Canadian soldiers relieved American soldiers in a combat situation.\nCanadian forces also undertook [[Operation Harpoon (2002)|Operation Harpoon]] in the [[Shah-i-Kot Valley]].

The soldiers were conducting night-time training on a designated live-fire range, and the American pilots mistook their gunfire for a Taliban insurgent attack.

This plays a huge part in the war in Afghanistan. In preparations, \"soldiers needed to know as much as possible about local customs, culture, and politics, and about the nature and motivation of groups that might oppose the establishment of peace and order.\"<ref name=\"Windsor59\">{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|p=59}}</ref> This, accompanied with psychological triaging with a soldier's family, made this deployment of Canadian forces the most ever prepared overseas. In training for the mission the goal in Afghanistan was clear: \"The Afghan mission would only succeed when the Government of Afghanistan could provide for the needs of its people.\"<ref name=\"Windsor59\"/> It was this notion that shaped the Canadian and NATO approach toward reconstructing the Afghan society.\n\n==2006 renewed commitments: Operation Archer==\n\n[[File:M777 Howitzer Helmand April2007.JPEG|thumb|Canadian soldiers fire an M777 155mm Howitzer field artillery gun at Taliban fighting positions near the Sangin District Center.]]\n[[Operation Archer]] followed Athena beginning in February 2006. Unlike the ISAF-led ATHENA, ARCHER was part of the American military command. By the spring of 2006, Canada had a major role in southern Afghanistan, with Task Force Afghanistan being a battle group of 2,300 soldiers based at [[Kandahar]]. Canada also commanded the Multi-National Brigade for Command South, a main military force in the region. In May 2006, the Canadian government extended Canadian military commitments to Afghanistan by two years, replacing earlier plans to withdraw soldiers in 2006.\n\nOn 28 February 2006, control of [[Train Advise Assist Command - South|Regional Command South]] was transferred from U.S. Lieutenant General [[Karl Eikenberry]] to Canadian Brigadier-General [[David Fraser (Canadian)|David Fraser]] in a ceremony at [[Kandahar Airfield]].\n\nAdditionally, [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (Canada)|Foreign Affairs]] Canada stated that the commitment was more than just military, employing a \"whole of government approach\", in which a [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]] (PRT), utilizing personnel from the military, Foreign Affairs, the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], would provide a dual role of security as well as reconstruction of the country and political structure.<ref name=\"Canada.html\"/>\n\nOn 31 July 2006, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force assumed command of the south of the country and the Canadian Task Force was transferred from the jurisdiction of ARCHER ([[Operation Enduring Freedom]]) back to ATHENA (ISAF).\n\n==2006\u20132009: Taliban resurgence==\n\n[[File:LAV3patrol.jpg|thumb|left|Kandahar Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) during a patrol]]\nWhen the Canadian Forces returned to Kandahar after being deployed to Kabul in 2003, the Taliban began a major offensive, and the Canadians were caught in the middle. After a spring in which a record number of attacks against Canadian soldiers had been set, which included six deaths to the CF, the Taliban in Kandahar and [[Helmand Province]]s were massing.\n\n[[Operation Mountain Thrust]] was launched in the beginning of the summer in 2006. Canadians of the 1 PPCLI Battle Group were one of the leading combatants and the first fighting when the [[Battle of Panjwaii]] took place. Complex mud-walled compounds made the rural [[Panjwaii District]] take on an almost urban style of fighting in some places. Daily firefights, artillery bombardments, and allied airstrikes turned the tides of the battle in favour of the Canadians. After Operation Mountain Thrust came to an end, Taliban fighters flooded back into the Panjwaii District in numbers that had not been seen yet in a single area in the \"post Anaconda\" war.\n\nThe Canadian Forces came under [[NATO]] command at the end of July, and the 1 RCR Battle Group replaced the PPCLI. Canadians launched [[Operation Medusa]] in September in an attempt to clear the areas of Taliban fighters from Panjwaii once and for all. The fighting of Operation Medusa led the way to the second, and most fierce Battle of Panjwaii in which daily gun-battles, ambushes, and mortar and rocket attacks were targeting the Canadian troops. The Taliban had massed with an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 fighters. The Taliban were reluctant to give up the area, and after being surrounded by the Canadian Forces, they dug in and fought a more conventional style battle. After weeks of fighting, the Taliban had been cleared from the Panjwaii area and Canadian reconstruction efforts in the area began.\n\nOn 15 September 2006, the Canadian government committed a [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of [[Leopard C1 tank|Leopard C2 tank]]s from [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)|Lord Strathcona's Horse]], and an additional 200 to 500 troops to Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/09/15/tanks-afghanistan.html | work=[[CBC News]] | title=More soldiers, tanks necessary to fight Taliban: Ottawa | date=15 September 2006}}</ref>\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 110703-A-QR782-071.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian CH-147 and CH-146 over Daman District Center.]] \nOn 1 November 2006, Dutch Major-General [[Ton van Loon]] succeeded Brigadier-General [[David Fraser (Canadian)|David Fraser]] as head of NATO Regional Command South in Afghanistan, a post which he retained for six months.<ref>[http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/lf/English/6_1_1.asp?id=1275 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208065114/http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/lf/English/6_1_1.asp?id=1275 |date=8 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn 15 December 2006, the Canadians launched [[Operation Falcon Summit]] into\n[[Zhari District]], to the north of Panjwaii. The operation was the Canadian involvement in the NATO-led [[Operation Mountain Fury]]. During Operation Falcon Summit, the Canadians gained control of several key villages and towns that were former Taliban havens, such as Howz-E Madad. During the first week of the operation, massive Canadian artillery and tank barrages were carried out in a successful attempt to clear pockets of Taliban resistance. The operation concluded with plans to build a new road linking Panjwaii with Kandahar's Highway 1 that runs east-west through Zhari.\n\nIn February 2007, the 2 RCR Battle Group took over to carry on with combat operations in several districts in Kandahar Province.\n\nFrom 15 July 2007 to February 2008, units from [[CFB Valcartier]] near Quebec City served in Kandahar filling most positions in the [[Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team]] (OMLT) and providing the protective company for the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT). The 3rd Battalion [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]] Battle Group, with supporting troops from [[5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group]] and a composite tank squadron from [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)]] conducted operations on the ground. This rotation reflected a change in Canadian tactics, with emphasis on systematically clearing-holding-building in the districts of [[Panjwaii District|Panjwaii]] and [[Zhari]], while also protecting [[Arghandab District]] and the Afghan\u2013Pakistan border in the area of [[Spin Boldak]]. The focus was on intimately working with the Afghan army, police and civil administration to hold cleared areas rather than subsequently lose them to returning Taliban, as had previously occurred throughout the South and East.\n\nIn February 2008, the [[Van Doos]] contingent was replaced by force centred on a [[PPCLI]] battle group. Also in February 2008, Canadian Major-General [[Marc Lessard]] took command of Regional Command South for a nine-month period.\n\nOn 13 March 2008, the Harper Conservative government's motion to extend the military mission past February 2009 into 2011 was approved in a parliamentary vote with the support of the Liberal opposition. The extension of almost another three years had a focus on reconstruction and training of Afghan troops, and set a firm pullout date, calling for Canadian troops to leave Afghanistan by December 2011. While the Liberals voted in favour of the Conservatives' confidence motion, the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] and the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] voted against it, having consistently rejected any extension of the military mission. NDP leader Jack Layton said \"There are millions of Canadians who don't want this strategy to continue.

The KPRT task was in relation to the National Solidarity Program (NSP). The NSP was \"designed to re-generate local village councils and their ability to work for a common purpose, something sorely lacking after 25 years of focus on basic self-preservation.\"<ref name=\"Windsor_xx\">{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008|p=xx}}</ref> The role of KPRT to fulfill the goals of the NSP was one that required much time and patience. As the NSP grew, \"power shifted away from drug lords and Taliban chieftains and back to Afghans\" through the rebuilding of community and creating trust in the \"power of good government.\"<ref name=\"Windsor_xx\"/>\n\nCanada and its allies used several methods to develop and build the economy in Kandahar. One of its main challenges was convincing its people that their future lies in good government and much had to be done. One of the tasks at hand was the organization and professionalism that needed to be added to the Afghan police. The problem that Canadians faced is that one day they may be dealing with Afghan police who assist with tracking down the Taliban, and the next a corrupt police force taking bribes from the Taliban and drug lords. In order to correct this Canadians used the RCMP to \"train new police forces in war-shattered societies.\"<ref>{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008|p=117}}</ref>\n\nAnother crucial element toward the rebirth in Kandahar is its agriculture, and the need to show farmers how to prosper. After facing ten years of drought \"CIDA focused development on getting [[wadi]]s, [[karez]]es, canals, and more modern pipelines into the older fields so that farmers could radically increase crop production.\"<ref>{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008|p=115}}</ref> The next step was then teaching the Afghan farmers how to \"improve crop yields\" which they were receptive to, wanting to improve their way of life. The difficulty with farmers in this region is the fact that their interests coincide with the Taliban and local drug lords. Both these groups, \"depend on a climate of fear and dependency in the countryside to support their lifestyles and their wars.\"<ref>{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008|p=116}}</ref> By 2007 the work of the PRT was gaining considerable ground. This was evident as \"Kandaharis took on much of the rebuilding process themselves.\" The Taliban threat was down and the UN plan for the people of Kandahar to help it its own renewal was in full effect. Despite the continued fighting and Taliban resurgence Kandahar was maintaining stability and beginning to prosper.\n\nThe PRT is about one-eighth the size of the overall 2,830 Canadian military forces in Afghanistan. The 2008 Manley Report recommended that the KPRT be given more funding and attention and be placed under civilian leadership instead. The KPRT was transferred to civilian command in April 2010, during the update in the US civilian surge to Kandahar, with the Representative of Canada in Kandahar Ben Rowswell as KPRT Director and former US Ambassador Bill Harris as Deputy Director. With impending Canadian draw down in 2011 and increasing number of US soldiers and civilians in Kandahar, the KPRT transitioned from Canadian to American command in late 2010, completed with the transfer of authority in early 2011 of KPRT directorship from Tim Martin to American diplomat Ben Moeling.<ref name=\"Manley Panel Report\"/>\n\n==\"Signature\" projects==\nFollowing the recommendations of the Manley report, the Canadian government sought to highlight several so-called \"signature\" projects in [[Kandahar Province]].<ref name=\"Manley Panel Report\"/> The government of Canada's communications on Afghanistan website highlights:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afghanistan.gc.ca/canada-afghanistan/projects-projets/index.aspx?menu_id=64&menu=L |title=Signature Projects |publisher=Afghanistan.gc.ca |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503235500/http://www.afghanistan.gc.ca/canada-afghanistan/projects-projets/index.aspx?menu_id=64&menu=L |archive-date=3 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Dahla Dam]] and irrigation system: Canada put $50 million over three years toward this project to assist with irrigation and basic services across the region.

Roads and bridges have been repaired, new roads have been built, and new wells have been dug. Access to health clinics is vastly better than it was five years ago and the infant mortality rate is beginning to drop.

Colvin testified that \"According to our information, the likelihood is that all the Afghans we handed over were tortured.

Eggleton summed up the dominant thinking in the government at the time when he said, \"Any Canadian military deployment to Afghanistan may well be similar to a situation in Eritrea and Ethiopia where we went in on the first wave, we helped establish the stabilization, the basis for ongoing peace support operations that would come after ... but then turned it over to somebody else.\"<ref>{{harvp|Stein|Lang|2008}}</ref> The operations were aimed at identifying and neutralizing [[al-Qaeda]] members in that country, as well as toppling the [[Taliban]] regime, which was supporting international terrorism.\n\n==Canadian experience in nation-building and sector reform==\n\n{{tone|date=April 2014}}\nIn post-Cold War conflicts, Canada \"experienced a steep\u2014and at times bloody\u2014learning curve as it tried to develop new techniques to contain violence and restore functioning civil societies.\"<ref>{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008}}</ref> After a 15-hour firefight in [[Croatia]] involving Canadian troops at a site known as the [[Medak Pocket]], it became clear that the rules of engagement had to allow that what were defined initially as \"peacekeeping forces had to be able to make that rapid tactical transition.

Moving to Bosnia, [[Somalia]], and [[Haiti]] a new peacekeeping partnership began to form. It required the assistance of soldiers and development organizations working closely to achieve their rebuilding goals. These peacekeeping initiatives carried out by \"Canadians and other NATO troops in Bosnia and elsewhere in the post-Cold War conflicts are similar and relevant to what they are carrying out in Afghanistan. In many respects the peace-building in Kandahar is just one more example of the 'new normal.'\"<ref>{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008|p=16}}</ref>\n\n==2001\u20132002: initial deployment==\n\nGeneral [[Ray Henault]], the [[Chief of the Defense Staff (Canada)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], issued preliminary orders to several CF units, as [[Operation Apollo]] was established.

In May 2006, the Canadian government extended Canadian military commitments to Afghanistan by two years, replacing earlier plans to withdraw soldiers in 2006.\n\nOn 28 February 2006, control of [[Train Advise Assist Command - South|Regional Command South]] was transferred from U.S. Lieutenant General [[Karl Eikenberry]] to Canadian Brigadier-General [[David Fraser (Canadian)|David Fraser]] in a ceremony at [[Kandahar Airfield]].\n\nAdditionally, [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (Canada)|Foreign Affairs]] Canada stated that the commitment was more than just military, employing a \"whole of government approach\", in which a [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]] (PRT), utilizing personnel from the military, Foreign Affairs, the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], would provide a dual role of security as well as reconstruction of the country and political structure.<ref name=\"Canada.html\"/>\n\nOn 31 July 2006, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force assumed command of the south of the country and the Canadian Task Force was transferred from the jurisdiction of ARCHER ([[Operation Enduring Freedom]]) back to ATHENA (ISAF).\n\n==2006\u20132009: Taliban resurgence==\n\n[[File:LAV3patrol.jpg|thumb|left|Kandahar Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) during a patrol]]\nWhen the Canadian Forces returned to Kandahar after being deployed to Kabul in 2003, the Taliban began a major offensive, and the Canadians were caught in the middle. After a spring in which a record number of attacks against Canadian soldiers had been set, which included six deaths to the CF, the Taliban in Kandahar and [[Helmand Province]]s were massing.\n\n[[Operation Mountain Thrust]] was launched in the beginning of the summer in 2006. Canadians of the 1 PPCLI Battle Group were one of the leading combatants and the first fighting when the [[Battle of Panjwaii]] took place. Complex mud-walled compounds made the rural [[Panjwaii District]] take on an almost urban style of fighting in some places. Daily firefights, artillery bombardments, and allied airstrikes turned the tides of the battle in favour of the Canadians. After Operation Mountain Thrust came to an end, Taliban fighters flooded back into the Panjwaii District in numbers that had not been seen yet in a single area in the \"post Anaconda\" war.\n\nThe Canadian Forces came under [[NATO]] command at the end of July, and the 1 RCR Battle Group replaced the PPCLI. Canadians launched [[Operation Medusa]] in September in an attempt to clear the areas of Taliban fighters from Panjwaii once and for all. The fighting of Operation Medusa led the way to the second, and most fierce Battle of Panjwaii in which daily gun-battles, ambushes, and mortar and rocket attacks were targeting the Canadian troops. The Taliban had massed with an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 fighters. The Taliban were reluctant to give up the area, and after being surrounded by the Canadian Forces, they dug in and fought a more conventional style battle. After weeks of fighting, the Taliban had been cleared from the Panjwaii area and Canadian reconstruction efforts in the area began.\n\nOn 15 September 2006, the Canadian government committed a [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of [[Leopard C1 tank|Leopard C2 tank]]s from [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)|Lord Strathcona's Horse]], and an additional 200 to 500 troops to Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/09/15/tanks-afghanistan.html | work=[[CBC News]] | title=More soldiers, tanks necessary to fight Taliban: Ottawa | date=15 September 2006}}</ref>\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 110703-A-QR782-071.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian CH-147 and CH-146 over Daman District Center.]] \nOn 1 November 2006, Dutch Major-General [[Ton van Loon]] succeeded Brigadier-General [[David Fraser (Canadian)|David Fraser]] as head of NATO Regional Command South in Afghanistan, a post which he retained for six months.<ref>[http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/lf/English/6_1_1.asp?id=1275 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208065114/http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/lf/English/6_1_1.asp?id=1275 |date=8 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn 15 December 2006, the Canadians launched [[Operation Falcon Summit]] into\n[[Zhari District]], to the north of Panjwaii. The operation was the Canadian involvement in the NATO-led [[Operation Mountain Fury]]. During Operation Falcon Summit, the Canadians gained control of several key villages and towns that were former Taliban havens, such as Howz-E Madad. During the first week of the operation, massive Canadian artillery and tank barrages were carried out in a successful attempt to clear pockets of Taliban resistance. The operation concluded with plans to build a new road linking Panjwaii with Kandahar's Highway 1 that runs east-west through Zhari.\n\nIn February 2007, the 2 RCR Battle Group took over to carry on with combat operations in several districts in Kandahar Province.\n\nFrom 15 July 2007 to February 2008, units from [[CFB Valcartier]] near Quebec City served in Kandahar filling most positions in the [[Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team]] (OMLT) and providing the protective company for the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT). The 3rd Battalion [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]] Battle Group, with supporting troops from [[5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group]] and a composite tank squadron from [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)]] conducted operations on the ground. This rotation reflected a change in Canadian tactics, with emphasis on systematically clearing-holding-building in the districts of [[Panjwaii District|Panjwaii]] and [[Zhari]], while also protecting [[Arghandab District]] and the Afghan\u2013Pakistan border in the area of [[Spin Boldak]]. The focus was on intimately working with the Afghan army, police and civil administration to hold cleared areas rather than subsequently lose them to returning Taliban, as had previously occurred throughout the South and East.\n\nIn February 2008, the [[Van Doos]] contingent was replaced by force centred on a [[PPCLI]] battle group. Also in February 2008, Canadian Major-General [[Marc Lessard]] took command of Regional Command South for a nine-month period.\n\nOn 13 March 2008, the Harper Conservative government's motion to extend the military mission past February 2009 into 2011 was approved in a parliamentary vote with the support of the Liberal opposition. The extension of almost another three years had a focus on reconstruction and training of Afghan troops, and set a firm pullout date, calling for Canadian troops to leave Afghanistan by December 2011. While the Liberals voted in favour of the Conservatives' confidence motion, the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] and the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] voted against it, having consistently rejected any extension of the military mission. NDP leader Jack Layton said \"There are millions of Canadians who don't want this strategy to continue.

During this time, two major operations involving about 160 troops along with two platoons of ANA were conducted under the name Operation Azida 1 and Operation Azida 2. 7 Platoon 3RCR's involvement in the operations over three months confronted them with as many as 75 skirmishes with Taliban forces, and approximately 50\u201375 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were found. On one occasion, a Chinook helicopter was struck in flight by an insurgent RPG. This resulted in a hard landing, and complete destruction of the helicopter, but with no reported serious injuries.

The KPRT task was in relation to the National Solidarity Program (NSP). The NSP was \"designed to re-generate local village councils and their ability to work for a common purpose, something sorely lacking after 25 years of focus on basic self-preservation.\"<ref name=\"Windsor_xx\">{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008|p=xx}}</ref> The role of KPRT to fulfill the goals of the NSP was one that required much time and patience. As the NSP grew, \"power shifted away from drug lords and Taliban chieftains and back to Afghans\" through the rebuilding of community and creating trust in the \"power of good government.\"<ref name=\"Windsor_xx\"/>\n\nCanada and its allies used several methods to develop and build the economy in Kandahar. One of its main challenges was convincing its people that their future lies in good government and much had to be done. One of the tasks at hand was the organization and professionalism that needed to be added to the Afghan police. The problem that Canadians faced is that one day they may be dealing with Afghan police who assist with tracking down the Taliban, and the next a corrupt police force taking bribes from the Taliban and drug lords. In order to correct this Canadians used the RCMP to \"train new police forces in war-shattered societies.\"<ref>{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008|p=117}}</ref>\n\nAnother crucial element toward the rebirth in Kandahar is its agriculture, and the need to show farmers how to prosper. After facing ten years of drought \"CIDA focused development on getting [[wadi]]s, [[karez]]es, canals, and more modern pipelines into the older fields so that farmers could radically increase crop production.\"<ref>{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008|p=115}}</ref> The next step was then teaching the Afghan farmers how to \"improve crop yields\" which they were receptive to, wanting to improve their way of life. The difficulty with farmers in this region is the fact that their interests coincide with the Taliban and local drug lords. Both these groups, \"depend on a climate of fear and dependency in the countryside to support their lifestyles and their wars.\"<ref>{{harvp|Windsor|Charters|Wilson|2008|p=116}}</ref> By 2007 the work of the PRT was gaining considerable ground. This was evident as \"Kandaharis took on much of the rebuilding process themselves.\" The Taliban threat was down and the UN plan for the people of Kandahar to help it its own renewal was in full effect. Despite the continued fighting and Taliban resurgence Kandahar was maintaining stability and beginning to prosper.\n\nThe PRT is about one-eighth the size of the overall 2,830 Canadian military forces in Afghanistan. The 2008 Manley Report recommended that the KPRT be given more funding and attention and be placed under civilian leadership instead. The KPRT was transferred to civilian command in April 2010, during the update in the US civilian surge to Kandahar, with the Representative of Canada in Kandahar Ben Rowswell as KPRT Director and former US Ambassador Bill Harris as Deputy Director. With impending Canadian draw down in 2011 and increasing number of US soldiers and civilians in Kandahar, the KPRT transitioned from Canadian to American command in late 2010, completed with the transfer of authority in early 2011 of KPRT directorship from Tim Martin to American diplomat Ben Moeling.<ref name=\"Manley Panel Report\"/>\n\n==\"Signature\" projects==\nFollowing the recommendations of the Manley report, the Canadian government sought to highlight several so-called \"signature\" projects in [[Kandahar Province]].<ref name=\"Manley Panel Report\"/> The government of Canada's communications on Afghanistan website highlights:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afghanistan.gc.ca/canada-afghanistan/projects-projets/index.aspx?menu_id=64&menu=L |title=Signature Projects |publisher=Afghanistan.gc.ca |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503235500/http://www.afghanistan.gc.ca/canada-afghanistan/projects-projets/index.aspx?menu_id=64&menu=L |archive-date=3 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Dahla Dam]] and irrigation system: Canada put $50 million over three years toward this project to assist with irrigation and basic services across the region.

They were featured as the managers of a [[condominium|condorstonium]] development called Deadrock Arms that [[Fred Flintstone]] and [[Barney Rubble]] considered moving their families into.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/fred-and-barney-meet-the-thing/fred-and-barney-meet-the-frankenstones-755821/|title=Fred and Barney Meet the Frankenstones|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=2018-03-15}}</ref> This Frankenstone family consisted of:\n\n* '''Frank Frankenstone''', a [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]]-style father (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]])\n* '''Hidea Frankenstone''', his wife (voiced by [[Gay Autterson]])\n* '''Atrocia Frankenstone''', their giggly teenage daughter (voiced by [[Jean Vander Pyl]])\n* '''Freaky Frankenstone''', their son (voiced by [[Jim MacGeorge]])\n\nFrank's voice was patterned after [[Boris Karloff]] by voice actor John Stephenson, and Hidea had a pseudo-[[Romanian language|Transylvanian]] accent.\n\n==The Flintstone Prime-time Specials==\nA Frankenstone monster (voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]]) was featured in the 1979 Halloween special ''[[The Flintstones Meet Rockula and Frankenstone]]''. This version of Frankenstone was Count Rockula's unfinished creation, awoken prematurely when lightning strikes the machinery in Rockula's laboratory. Despite the resemblance, he is not to be confused with the Frank Frankenstone character that first appeared in ''The New Fred and Barney Show'' or featured in subsequent television specials and spin-off series.\n\nThe second version of the Frankenstones moved in next door to the Flintstones in ''[[The Flintstones' New Neighbors]]'' as part of a [[The Flintstone Primetime Specials|limited-run prime-time revival]] of ''The Flintstones'' which aired on [[NBC]] in 1980\u20131981. This time, the family consisted of:\n\n* '''Frank Frankenstone''' (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]])\n* '''Oblivia Frankenstone''', his wife (voiced by [[Patricia Parris]])\n* '''Hidea Frankenstone''', their daughter who resembles the original Atrocia (voiced by [[Julie McWhirter]])\n* '''Stubby Frankenstone''', their son who closely resembles Freaky (voiced by [[Jim MacGeorge]])\n\nAgain, the family is odd, and a friendship developed between the Flintstones and the Frankenstones. Frank's voice was still patterned after [[Boris Karloff]] by John Stephenson.

Written by [[Robert Bloch]] and directed by [[James Goldstone]], it first aired on October 20, 1966.\n\nIn the episode, [[Christine Chapel|Nurse Chapel]] searches for her long lost fianc\u00e9, and uncovers his secret plan to create sophisticated androids for galactic conquest.\n\nThe first episode of the series to be repeated on [[NBC]], the title of the episode is taken from the fourth line of the 19th-century [[nursery rhyme]], \"[[What Are Little Boys Made Of?]].\"\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] under the command of Captain [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]], travels to the icy [[planet]] Exo-III to search for the [[Astrobiology|exobiologist]] Dr. Roger Korby (played by [[Michael Strong]]). Korby is the fianc\u00e9 of [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]]'s temporary assistant, Nurse [[Christine Chapel]], who signed on to the ''Enterprise'' to search for Korby.\n\nAt Korby's request, Kirk and Chapel beam down alone to a cavern entrance, but Korby is not there to meet them. Kirk and Chapel eventually find him living in a system of [[cave]]s, left by an [[extinction|extinct]] [[Fantasy tropes#Races and species|race]]. Korby shows Kirk and Chapel machinery which creates [[android (robot)|android]]s. With the help of Ruk (played by [[Ted Cassidy]]), a still functioning android from the time of the original inhabitants, Korby has created more androids, one being a lovely woman he calls \"Andrea\". Chapel recognizes Korby's aide Dr. Brown, but is surprised the man does not remember her. In reality, Brown is also an android created as a prototype for Korby's plan to replace key personnel in the Federation with android duplicates under his control.\n\nKorby proceeds to create an exact android duplicate of Kirk as Chapel looks on. As Kirk's personality is imprinted on the android, the real Kirk imagines himself insulting Spock as a \"half-breed\". Korby has the duplicate Kirk beamed aboard the ''Enterprise'' with orders to begin the spread of android duplicates throughout the galaxy. When Spock questions the Kirk-android's orders, it repeats the insult Kirk had used. Spock, realizing that this is not Kirk, forms a security team and follows the Kirk-android back down to Exo-III.\n\nMeanwhile, the real Kirk, guarded by Ruk, convinces the android that Korby is a threat to his continued existence and must be destroyed. Ruk begins to recall the clash between the \"Old Ones\" and the androids that led to his [[civilization]]'s demise centuries ago, and concludes that conflict is again inevitable. Korby enters and Ruk confronts him, but Korby destroys Ruk with a [[Weapons in Star Trek#Phaser|phaser]]. Shortly afterwards, in a struggle with Kirk, the skin of Korby's hand is torn, revealing that he is also an android.\n\nIt is now revealed that Korby, dying of [[frostbite]], had transferred his mind to an android body. He begs Chapel to believe that he is still the same man, but Chapel is repelled by what he has done to himself. Andrea, realizing she loves Korby, kisses him, and in despair, Korby fires Andrea's phaser between the embracing pair, destroying them both.\n\nSpock arrives with the security force, but finds that the crisis has passed. When Spock inquires about Dr. Korby's whereabouts, Kirk replies, \"Dr. Korby was never here.\" In the end, Chapel decides to stay on with the ''Enterprise'' and finish out her tour of duty.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by Robert Bloch, but received rewrites during shooting by Gene Roddenberry.

Written by [[Robert Bloch]] and directed by [[James Goldstone]], it first aired on October 20, 1966.\n\nIn the episode, [[Christine Chapel|Nurse Chapel]] searches for her long lost fianc\u00e9, and uncovers his secret plan to create sophisticated androids for galactic conquest.\n\nThe first episode of the series to be repeated on [[NBC]], the title of the episode is taken from the fourth line of the 19th-century [[nursery rhyme]], \"[[What Are Little Boys Made Of?]].\"\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] under the command of Captain [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]], travels to the icy [[planet]] Exo-III to search for the [[Astrobiology|exobiologist]] Dr. Roger Korby (played by [[Michael Strong]]). Korby is the fianc\u00e9 of [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]]'s temporary assistant, Nurse [[Christine Chapel]], who signed on to the ''Enterprise'' to search for Korby.\n\nAt Korby's request, Kirk and Chapel beam down alone to a cavern entrance, but Korby is not there to meet them. Kirk and Chapel eventually find him living in a system of [[cave]]s, left by an [[extinction|extinct]] [[Fantasy tropes#Races and species|race]]. Korby shows Kirk and Chapel machinery which creates [[android (robot)|android]]s. With the help of Ruk (played by [[Ted Cassidy]]), a still functioning android from the time of the original inhabitants, Korby has created more androids, one being a lovely woman he calls \"Andrea\". Chapel recognizes Korby's aide Dr. Brown, but is surprised the man does not remember her. In reality, Brown is also an android created as a prototype for Korby's plan to replace key personnel in the Federation with android duplicates under his control.\n\nKorby proceeds to create an exact android duplicate of Kirk as Chapel looks on. As Kirk's personality is imprinted on the android, the real Kirk imagines himself insulting Spock as a \"half-breed\". Korby has the duplicate Kirk beamed aboard the ''Enterprise'' with orders to begin the spread of android duplicates throughout the galaxy. When Spock questions the Kirk-android's orders, it repeats the insult Kirk had used. Spock, realizing that this is not Kirk, forms a security team and follows the Kirk-android back down to Exo-III.\n\nMeanwhile, the real Kirk, guarded by Ruk, convinces the android that Korby is a threat to his continued existence and must be destroyed. Ruk begins to recall the clash between the \"Old Ones\" and the androids that led to his [[civilization]]'s demise centuries ago, and concludes that conflict is again inevitable. Korby enters and Ruk confronts him, but Korby destroys Ruk with a [[Weapons in Star Trek#Phaser|phaser]]. Shortly afterwards, in a struggle with Kirk, the skin of Korby's hand is torn, revealing that he is also an android.\n\nIt is now revealed that Korby, dying of [[frostbite]], had transferred his mind to an android body. He begs Chapel to believe that he is still the same man, but Chapel is repelled by what he has done to himself. Andrea, realizing she loves Korby, kisses him, and in despair, Korby fires Andrea's phaser between the embracing pair, destroying them both.\n\nSpock arrives with the security force, but finds that the crisis has passed. When Spock inquires about Dr. Korby's whereabouts, Kirk replies, \"Dr. Korby was never here.\" In the end, Chapel decides to stay on with the ''Enterprise'' and finish out her tour of duty.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by Robert Bloch, but received rewrites during shooting by Gene Roddenberry. The director of the second pilot [[Where No Man Has Gone Before]], [[James Goldstone]], was hired to direct this episode but due to problems with the script shooting went two days over schedule and Goldstone was never re-hired.<ref>{{cite book\n  | authorlink =Herbert Franklin Solow\n  | author =Herbert Franklin Solow\n  | author2 =Robert H.
