The village of Winter Park was still in its infancy at this time, less than five years old, but both the incorporation of a railroad and the inaugural classes beginning at Rollins College in 1885 influenced the town's image as a desirable place to live. Intent on creating a [[lending library]] for the community, this ambitious group of women held a meeting at the Congregational Parsonage, which is now the location of the current Rollins campus, roughly where the Archibald Granville Bush Science Center sits today. \n\nThis was a time of male-only [[suffrage]], and women had to content themselves with more \u201cladylike\u201d pursuits, such as ministering to the needy and coming up with ideas for civic projects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> All elected officers of the [[circulating library]], however, would be women. The president was Mrs. Elizabeth P. Hooker, the wife of a doctor and Congregational minister, as well as a president of Rollins College. She was raised by a professor at [[Middlebury College]], where she received some advanced education and was likely familiar with the workings of a college library. The \u201ctwo Marys\u201d in the group, Mary McClure and Mary E. Brown, were both retired teachers. Brown would be remembered as being \"of a singularly acute and independent mind, a lover of the best books, a keen critic, and an unfailing source of intellectual stimulus to all who knew her.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> Alice Guild and her sister, Clara, came from Boston with their father in 1883. Alice, 25 at the time, was elected as fundraiser for the library, while her sister, Clara, albeit not one of the library's noted founders, was in her own right a member of the first class at Rollins and later received the college's first degree conferred upon a woman. Evaline Lamson was only 30 when she became the driving force behind the library's survival and for several years served simultaneously as librarian for the town library and the one at Rollins College. Little is known about the remaining members, Mrs. C. J. Ladd, Mrs. Clark, Mrs. Cook, and Mrs. W. O. Cady, except that the latter would become the first librarian for the Winter Park Circulating Library. \n\n[[File:Winter Park Public Library, 1902.jpg|thumb|Winter Park Public Library, 1902]]While deliberating and discussing details, the most crucial decision for the women was not how to get the necessary books, as they had been circulating books among themselves for some time, but where to base their new venture.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> The first site was the Lamson house at 503 Interlachen Avenue, and initially operating only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Records for the year of 1887 gave some insight into what was being read that year, including ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'', ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', and ''[[The Rise of Silas Lapham]]''. Biographies were also popular, such as those on [[Frederick the Great]], and religious titles, ''The Blood of Jesus'', ''Thoughts on Personal Religion'', and ''Scientific Theism''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> Since the library shelves and inventory were limited, the rules for borrowing material were that members could take out one book on Wednesday and Saturday and keep it for two weeks, with a one-week renewal. They would impose a 10-cent fine for non-renewals, and those who were not members would be allowed to take out books if they paid a $1 deposit plus 10 cents for each week.\n\nOne year after the library's founding, as recorded in the minutes of the annual meeting held on December 16, 1886, the officers accepted an offer to move its operations from Miss Lamson's porch to a room in a building occupied by the [[Winter Park Company]] on the southwest corner of New England and Park Avenues. The Winter Park Circulating Library Association wrote its [[constitution]] in 1888.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nEconomic devastation would bring the library to the brink of closure in 1895. As it is today, Florida's two biggest commodities are citrus and tourism. Winter Park relied on winter visitors, but according to ''The History of Orlando'' by Eve Bacon, \u201cthe temperature dropped to 24 degrees the Sunday after Christmas Day in 1894,\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> and dropped even lower to an astounding 17 degrees in February. This hard freeze killed trees and citrus, and potential visitors to the area, hearing news of the record cold, decided not to visit. The blow to the area's economy was evident in the library's December 1895 annual meeting, where the treasurer's report revealed an existing balance of $8.60.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> In spite of this drop in profit, the overall bleak outlook of the time gave an unexpected boost in inventory, which may have been gifted books by families moving from the area. The population of Winter Park would fluctuate dramatically from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth, but the welcome addition of some wealthy new residents would bring relief via donations, which enabled the library to buy more books in 1896. \n\nIn 1900, discussion of what should be included in a new, permanent building effectively set the library's policy for years to come, as the decision was made to include a children's department. The Winter Park Circulating Library Association's president, Eleanora Comstock, called a meeting to propose plans and start fundraising efforts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> Pledges of $1,216 were received by February 1901, and land was donated by the estate of Francis Knowles. The library opened in April 1902.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> This also expanded hours of operation to every day. Fundraising consisted of outreach to the public and a financial commitment from the city government, which continues to this day.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nIndoor plumbing was not part of the original design of the new building in 1900, and in the absence of modern insulation, complaints about heat in the summer and cold in the winter are recorded aspects of its history.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nProsperity inevitably came back to the area due in part to both a revitalized citrus industry and the construction of the new [[Seminole Hotel]] in 1912 following a fire that had burned down the prior building, and had long been a great source of revenue for the library. Also, the town council agreed to provide free electricity to the library building in 1914. In light of these developments and donations, the library added a kitchen wing that same year, which inspired the ladies of the library to continue a series of teas, fundraising socials and other events of interest to potential patrons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> The library would eventually double in size in 1924 when they added two new wings and a [[Toilet (room)|lavatory]]. And by 1945, the library had a collection of 12,269 books and a circulation of 33,214.\n\nDespite the historical and commendable efforts behind the library's origin and contribution to the community of Winter Park during this time, it had remained somewhat of an exclusive group of patrons that many residents chose not to join. Furthermore, the library only served the white townspeople. A separate library was founded in the heart of the black residential community in mid-1937. Founded by Dr. Edwin O. Grover in 1937, the [[Hannibal Square Library]] was established for African American residents, dedicated in memory of his wife, who had been an activist in the cause of education and the black community.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> Initially functioning as an independent library, it began receiving regular appropriations from the city in the 1950s, albeit on a smaller scale than that received by the Winter Park Public Library. A children's room was added in 1955. A popular place for children and local organizations to meet, neighbors maintained the grounds, donated to the organization, and planted shrubbery and flowers to beautify it. The Board of Directors was composed of black and white residents. The Winter Park Public Library [[Racial integration|integrated]] in 1962 and 1963, adopting a policy of library service to all residents of Winter Park, irrespective of age, race, creed, color or financial situation. In 1979, the Hannibal Square Library was closed due to decline in circulation and the building and grounds were returned to the city's council.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it was initially proposed to simply build on to the existing library site, the issue of insufficient parking was the inspiration for constructing a new building on a different site. In September 1976, the city bought some land at 460 East New England Avenue, and in July 1977, the Library received a grant for construction on the site. Soon thereafter, the Winter Park Public Library opened with nearly twice the square footage and increased parking spaces from thirteen to sixty-five.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> The facility was expanded starting in 1994, adding a third floor to allow more space for services to patrons aged 12 to 18.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAgain, a lack of space to continue offering future-ready programming and an effective and sustainable library led to the 2016 initiative to create a new library building. In March 2016, voters passed an issuance of a $30 million bond referendum to finance the cost to construct this new facility. However, public opposition delayed the process for several years.

The village of Winter Park was still in its infancy at this time, less than five years old, but both the incorporation of a railroad and the inaugural classes beginning at Rollins College in 1885 influenced the town's image as a desirable place to live. Intent on creating a [[lending library]] for the community, this ambitious group of women held a meeting at the Congregational Parsonage, which is now the location of the current Rollins campus, roughly where the Archibald Granville Bush Science Center sits today. \n\nThis was a time of male-only [[suffrage]], and women had to content themselves with more \u201cladylike\u201d pursuits, such as ministering to the needy and coming up with ideas for civic projects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> All elected officers of the [[circulating library]], however, would be women. The president was Mrs. Elizabeth P. Hooker, the wife of a doctor and Congregational minister, as well as a president of Rollins College. She was raised by a professor at [[Middlebury College]], where she received some advanced education and was likely familiar with the workings of a collage library. The \u201ctwo Marys\u201d in the group, Mary McClure and Mary E. Brown, were both retired teachers. Brown would be remembered as being \"of a singularly acute and independent mind, a lover of the best books, a keen critic, and an unfailing source of intellectual stimulus to all who knew her.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> Alice Guild and her sister, Clara, came from Boston with their father in 1883. Alice, 25 at the time, was elected as fundraiser for the library, while her sister, Clara, albeit not one of the library's noted founders, was in her own right a member of the first class at Rollins and later received the college's first degree conferred upon a woman. Evaline Lamson was only 30 when she became the driving force behind the library's survival and for several years served simultaneously as librarian for the town library and the one at Rollins College. Little is known about the remaining members, Mrs. C. J. Ladd, Mrs. Clark, Mrs. Cook, and Mrs. W. O. Cady, except that the latter would become the first librarian for the Winter Park Circulating Library. \n\n[[File:Winter Park Public Library, 1902.jpg|thumb|Winter Park Public Library, 1902]]While deliberating and discussing details, the most crucial decision for the women was not how to get the necessary books, as they had been circulating books among themselves for some time, but where to base their new venture.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> The first site was the Lamson house at 503 Interlachen Avenue, and initially operating only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Records for the year of 1887 gave some insight into what was being read that year, including ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'', ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', and ''[[The Rise of Silas Lapham]]''. Biographies were also popular, such as those on [[Frederick the Great]], and religious titles, ''The Blood of Jesus'', ''Thoughts on Personal Religion'', and ''Scientific Theism''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> Since the library shelves and inventory were limited, the rules for borrowing material were that members could take out one book on Wednesday and Saturday and keep it for two weeks, with a one-week renewal. They would impose a 10-cent fine for non-renewals, and those who were not members would be allowed to take out books if they paid a $1 deposit plus 10 cents for each week.\n\nOne year after the library's founding, as recorded in the minutes of the annual meeting held on December 16, 1886, the officers accepted an offer to move its operations from Miss Lamson's porch to a room in a building occupied by the [[Winter Park Company]] on the southwest corner of New England and Park Avenues. The Winter Park Circulating Library Association wrote its [[constitution]] in 1888.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nEconomic devastation would bring the library to the brink of closure in 1895. As it is today, Florida's two biggest commodities are citrus and tourism. Winter Park relied on winter visitors, but according to ''The History of Orlando'' by Eve Bacon, \u201cthe temperature dropped to 24 degrees the Sunday after Christmas Day in 1894,\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> and dropped even lower to an astounding 17 degrees in February. This hard freeze killed trees and citrus, and potential visitors to the area, hearing news of the record cold, decided not to visit. The blow to the area's economy was evident in the library's December 1895 annual meeting, where the treasurer's report revealed an existing balance of $8.60.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> In spite of this drop in profit, the overall bleak outlook of the time gave an unexpected boost in inventory, which may have been gifted books by families moving from the area. The population of Winter Park would fluctuate dramatically from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth, but the welcome addition of some wealthy new residents would bring relief via donations, which enabled the library to buy more books in 1896. \n\nIn 1900, discussion of what should be included in a new, permanent building effectively set the library's policy for years to come, as the decision was made to include a children's department. The Winter Park Circulating Library Association's president, Eleanora Comstock, called a meeting to propose plans and start fundraising efforts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> Pledges of $1,216 were received by February 1901, and land was donated by the estate of Francis Knowles. The library opened in April 1902.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> This also expanded hours of operation to every day. Fundraising consisted of outreach to the public and a financial commitment from the city government, which continues to this day.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nIndoor plumbing was not part of the original design of the new building in 1900, and in the absence of modern insulation, complaints about heat in the summer and cold in the winter are recorded aspects of its history.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nProsperity inevitably came back to the area due in part to both a revitalized citrus industry and the construction of the new [[Seminole Hotel]] in 1912 following a fire that had burned down the prior building, and had long been a great source of revenue for the library. Also, the town council agreed to provide free electricity to the library building in 1914. In light of these developments and donations, the library added a kitchen wing that same year, which inspired the ladies of the library to continue a series of teas, fundraising socials and other events of interest to potential patrons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> The library would eventually double in size in 1924 when they added two new wings and a [[Toilet (room)|lavatory]]. And by 1945, the library had a collection of 12,269 books and a circulation of 33,214.\n\nDespite the historical and commendable efforts behind the library's origin and contribution to the community of Winter Park during this time, it had remained somewhat of an exclusive group of patrons that many residents chose not to join. Furthermore, the library only served the white townspeople. A separate library was founded in the heart of the black residential community in mid-1937. Founded by Dr. Edwin O. Grover in 1937, the [[Hannibal Square Library]] was established for African American residents, dedicated in memory of his wife, who had been an activist in the cause of education and the black community.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref> Initially functioning as an independent library, it began receiving regular appropriations from the city in the 1950s, albeit on a smaller scale than that received by the Winter Park Public Library. A children's room was added in 1955. A popular place for children and local organizations to meet, neighbors maintained the grounds, donated to the organization, and planted shrubbery and flowers to beautify it. The Board of Directors was composed of black and white residents. The Winter Park Public Library [[Racial integration|integrated]] in 1962 and 1963, adopting a policy of library service to all residents of Winter Park, irrespective of age, race, creed, color or financial situation. In 1979, the Hannibal Square Library was closed due to decline in circulation and the building and grounds were returned to the city's council.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parnell|first1=Susana S.|last2=Vassel|first2=Yvonne C.T.|title=\"Winter Park Public Library\"|journal=USFLDC Home - All Collection Groups|date=April 2014|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/SFS0000129/00001/pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|publisher=The Florida Library History Project}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it was initially proposed to simply build on to the existing library site, the issue of insufficient parking was the inspiration for constructing a new building on a different site. In September 1976, the city bought some land at 460 East New England Avenue, and in July 1977, the Library received a grant for construction on the site. Soon thereafter, the Winter Park Public Library opened with nearly twice the square footage and increased parking spaces from thirteen to sixty-five.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> The facility was expanded starting in 1994, adding a third floor to allow more space for services to patrons aged 12 to 18.<ref>{{cite web|title=Info - About The Library|url=https://www.wppl.org/about|website=Winter Park Public Library|publisher=Winter Park Public Library|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAgain, a lack of space to continue offering future-ready programming and an effective and sustainable library led to the 2016 initiative to create a new library building. In March 2016, voters passed an issuance of a $30 million bond referendum to finance the cost to construct this new facility. However, public opposition delayed the process for several years.

A field is thus a fundamental [[algebraic structure]] which is widely used in [[algebra]], [[number theory]], and many other areas of mathematics.\n\nThe best known fields are the field of [[rational number]]s, the field of [[real number]]s and the field of [[complex number]]s. Many other fields, such as [[field of rational functions|fields of rational functions]], [[algebraic function field]]s, [[algebraic number field]]s, and [[p-adic number|''p''-adic fields]] are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and [[algebraic geometry]]. Most [[cryptographic protocol]]s rely on [[finite field]]s, i.e., fields with finitely many [[element (set)|elements]].\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a [[field extension]]. [[Galois theory]], initiated by [[\u00c9variste Galois]] in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that [[angle trisection]] and [[squaring the circle]] cannot be done with a [[compass and straightedge]]. Moreover, it shows that [[quintic equation]]s are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of [[mathematical analysis]], which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] for a [[vector space]], which is the standard general context for [[linear algebra]]. [[Number field]]s, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in [[number theory]]. [[Function field of an algebraic variety|Function fields]] can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\n== Definition ==\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two [[binary operation|operation]]s defined on that set: an addition operation written as {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}, and a multiplication operation written as {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}, both of which behave similarly as they behave for [[rational number]]s and [[real number]]s, including the existence of an [[additive inverse]] {{math|&minus;''a''}} for all elements {{mvar|a}}, and of a [[multiplicative inverse]] {{math|''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}} for every nonzero element {{mvar|b}}. This allows one to also consider the so-called ''inverse'' operations of [[Subtraction#Real numbers|subtraction]], {{math|''a'' &minus; ''b''}}, and [[Division (mathematics)|division]], {{math|''a'' / ''b''}}, by defining:\n:{{math|1=''a'' &minus; ''b'' = ''a'' + (&minus;''b'')}},\n:{{math|1=''a'' / ''b'' = ''a'' \u00b7 ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.\n\n===Classic definition===\n\nFormally, a field is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''F''}} together with two [[binary operation]]s on {{mvar|F}} called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=Definition 4.1.1, p.&nbsp;181}}</ref> A binary operation on {{mvar|F}} is a mapping {{math|''F'' &times; ''F'' &rarr; ''F''}}, that is, a correspondence that associates with each ordered pair of elements of ''F'' a uniquely determined element of {{mvar|F}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=16}}</ref> The result of the addition of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the sum of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the product of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as ''[[Axiom#Non-logical axioms|field axioms]]''. In these axioms, {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are arbitrary [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the field {{mvar|F}}.\n\n* [[Associativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' \u00b7 ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') \u00b7 ''c''}}.\n* [[Commutativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''b'' = ''b'' \u00b7 ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive identity|Additive]] and [[multiplicative identity]]: there exist two different elements {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} in {{math|''F''}} such that {{math|1=''a'' + 0 = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 1 = ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted {{math|\u2212''a''}}, called the ''additive inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' + (\u2212''a'') = 0}}.\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted by {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} or {{math|1/''a''}}, called the ''multiplicative inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> = 1}}.\n* [[Distributivity]] of multiplication over addition: {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') + (''a'' \u00b7 ''c'')}}.\n\nThis may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called addition and multiplication; it is an [[abelian group]] under addition with 0 as the additive identity; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under multiplication with 1 as the multiplicative identity; and multiplication distributes over addition.\n\n===Alternative definition===\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and their required properties. [[Division by zero]] is, by definition, excluded.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clark|1984|loc=Chapter 3}}.</ref> In order to avoid [[existential quantifier]]s, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses respectively), and two [[arity#Nullary|nullary]] operations (the constants {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[computing]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Mines|Richman|Ruitenburg|1988|loc=\u00a7II.2}}. See also [[Heyting field]].</ref> One may equivalently define a field by the same two binary operations, one unary operation (the multiplicative inverse), and two constants {{math|1}} and {{math|\u22121}}, since {{math|1=0 = 1 + (\u22121)}} and {{math|1=&minus;''a'' = (&minus;1)''a''}}.<ref group=nb>The a priori twofold use of the symbol \"\u2212\" for denoting one part of a constant and for the additive inverses is justified by this latter condition.</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Rational numbers===\n{{main|Rational number}}\nRational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.\nThey are numbers that can be written as [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]\n{{math|''a''/''b''}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are [[integer]]s, and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. The additive inverse of such a fraction is {{math|\u2212''a''/''b''}}, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}) is {{math|''b''/''a''}}, which can be seen as follows:\n\n: <math> \\frac b a \\cdot \\frac a b = \\frac{ba}{ab} = 1.</math>\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac a b \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d + \\frac e f \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b  \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d  \\cdot \\frac f f + \\frac e f \\cdot \\frac d d \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{cf}{df} + \\frac{ed}{fd}\\right) = \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{cf + ed}{df} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} = \\frac{acf}{bdf} +  \\frac{aed}{bdf} = \\frac{ac}{bd} +  \\frac{ae}{bf} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac c d + \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac e f.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Real and complex numbers===\n\n[[File:Complex_multi.svg|thumb|255px|The multiplication of complex numbers can be visualized geometrically by rotations and scalings.]]\n\n{{main|Real number| Complex number}}\nThe [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}} consist of expressions\n:{{math|''a'' + ''bi'',}} with {{math|''a'', ''b''}} real,\nwhere {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for {{math|'''C'''}}. For example, the distributive law enforces\n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''bi'')(''c'' + ''di'') = ''ac'' + ''bci'' + ''adi'' + ''bdi''<sup>2</sup> = ''ac''\u2212''bd'' + (''bc'' + ''ad'')''i''.}}\nIt is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], with [[Cartesian coordinates]] given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is &ndash;less intuitively&ndash; combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\n[[File:Root_construction_geometric_mean5.svg|thumb|255px|The [[geometric mean theorem]] asserts that {{math|1=''h''<sup>2</sup> = ''pq''}}. Choosing {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1}} allows construction of the square root of a given constructible number {{math|''p''}}.]]\n{{main|Constructible numbers}}\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with [[compass and straightedge]]. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle in this way. These problems can be settled using the field of [[constructible numbers]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Chapter 13.4}}</ref> Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only [[compass]] and [[straightedge]]. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of [[square root]]s of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within {{math|'''Q'''}}. Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments {{math|''AB''}}, {{math|''BD''}}, and a [[semicircle]] over {{math|''AD''}} (center at the [[midpoint]] {{math|''C''}}), which intersects the [[perpendicular]] line through {{math|''B''}} in a point {{math|''F''}}, at a distance of exactly <math>h=\\sqrt p</math> from {{math|''B''}} when {{math|''BD''}} has length one.\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that <math>\\sqrt[3] 2</math> is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a [[Doubling the cube|cube with volume 2]], another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\n===A field with four elements===\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center;\"| Addition\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center'\"| Multiplication\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| + !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|}\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| \u00b7 !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|}\n|}\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called {{math|''O''}}, {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''B''}}. The notation is chosen such that {{math|''O''}} plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\n: {{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 (''B'' + ''A'') = ''A'' \u00b7 ''I'' = ''A''}}, which equals {{nowrap|1={{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 ''B'' + ''A'' \u00b7 ''A'' = ''I'' + ''B'' = ''A''}}}}, as required by the distributivity.\n\nThis field is called a [[finite field]] with four elements, and is denoted {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} or {{math|GF(4)}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Example 1.62}}</ref> The subset consisting of {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the ''[[binary field]]'' {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} or {{math|GF(2)}}. In the context of [[computer science]] and [[Boolean algebra]], {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} are often denoted respectively by ''false'' and ''true'', the addition is then denoted [[XOR]] (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted [[Bitwise AND|AND]]. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with [[bit]]s.\n\n==Elementary notions==\nIn this section, {{math|''F''}} denotes an arbitrary field and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary [[element (set theory)|elements]] of {{math|''F''}}.\n\n===Consequences of the definition===\nOne has {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 0 = 0}} and {{math|1=\u2212''a'' = (\u22121) \u00b7 ''a''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref> In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows {{math|\u20131}}.\n\nIf {{math|1=''ab'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''a''}} or {{math|''b''}} must be 0. Indeed, if ''a''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;0, then \n{{math|1=0 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>\u22c50 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>(''ab'') = (''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>''a'')''b'' = ''b''}}. This means that every field is an [[integral domain]].\n\n===The additive and the multiplicative group of a field===\nThe axioms of a field {{math|''F''}} imply that it is an [[abelian group]] under addition. This group is called the [[additive group]] of the field, and is sometimes denoted by {{math|(''F'', +)}} when denoting it simply as {{math|''F''}} could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the ''nonzero'' elements of {{math|''F''}} form an abelian group under multiplication, called the [[multiplicative group]], and denoted by {{math|(''F'' \\ {0}, \u00b7)}} or just {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} or {{math|''F''<sup>*</sup>}}. \n\nA field may thus be defined as set {{math|''F''}} equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that {{math|''F''}} is an abelian group under addition, {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] over addition.<ref group=nb>Equivalently, a field is an [[algebraic structure]] {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u00b7, \u2212, <sup>\u22121</sup>, 0, 1\u27e9}} of type {{math|\u27e82, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0\u27e9}}, such that {{math|0<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is not defined, {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u2013, 0\u27e9}} and \n{{math|\u27e8''F'' \u2216 {0}, \u00b7, <sup>\u22121</sup>\u27e9}} are abelian groups, and \n\u00b7 is distributive over +. {{harvtxt|Wallace|1998|loc=Th. 2}}</ref> Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses {{math|\u2212''a''}} and {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''a''}}.\n\nThe requirement {{math|1 \u2260 0}} follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sharpe|1987|loc=Theorem 1.3.2}}</ref> Thus, the [[trivial ring]], consisting of a single element, is not a field.\n\nEvery finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] (see {{slink|Root of unity|Cyclic groups}}).\n\n===Characteristic===\nIn addition to the multiplication of two elements of ''F'', it is possible to define the product {{math|''n'' \u22c5 ''a''}} of an arbitrary element {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''F''}} by a positive [[integer]] {{math|''n''}} to be the {{math|''n''}}-fold sum\n:{{math|''a'' + ''a'' + ... + ''a''}} (which is an element of {{math|''F''}}.)\n\nIf there is no positive integer such that\n:{{math|1=''n'' \u22c5 1 = 0}},\nthen {{math|''F''}} is said to have [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=\u00a7I.2, p.&nbsp;10}}</ref> For example, the field of rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} has characteristic 0 since no positive integer {{math|''n''}} is zero. Otherwise, if there ''is'' a positive integer {{math|''n''}} satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a [[prime number]]. It is usually denoted by {{math|''p''}} and the field is said to have characteristic {{math|''p''}} then.\nFor example, the field {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) {{math| 1= I + I = O }}.\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} has characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''p'' \u22c5 ''a'' = 0}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}. This implies that \n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')<sup>''p''</sup> = ''a''<sup>''p''</sup> + ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>}},\nsince all other [[binomial coefficient]]s appearing in the [[binomial formula]] are divisible by {{math|''p''}}. Here, {{math|1=''a''<sup>''p''</sup> := ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''p''}} factors) is the {{math|''p''}}-th power, i.e., the {{math|''p''}}-fold product of the element {{math|''a''}}.

Equivalently {{math|''E''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that contains {{math|1}}, and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that {{math|1 \u220a ''E''}}, that for all {{math|''a'', ''b'' \u220a ''E''}} both {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' \u00b7 ''b''}} are in {{math|''E''}}, and that for all {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''E''}}, both {{math|\u2013''a''}} and {{math|1/''a''}} are in {{math|''E''}}.\n\n[[Field homomorphism]]s are maps {{math|''f'': ''E'' &rarr; ''F''}} between two fields such that {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub> + ''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>) + ''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>)''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, and {{math|1=''f''(1<sub>E</sub>) = 1<sub>F</sub>}}, where {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''e''<sub>2</sub>}} are arbitrary elements of {{math|''E''}}.

Any field {{math|''F''}} contains a prime field. If the characteristic of {{math|''F''}} is {{math|''p''}} (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} introduced below.

The above introductory example {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} is a field with four elements. Its subfield {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} is the smallest field, because by definition a field has at least two distinct elements {{math|1 \u2260 0}}.\n\n[[File:Clock_group.svg|thumb|In modular arithmetic modulo&nbsp;12, 9&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 since 9&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;13 in {{math|'''Z'''}}, which divided by 12 leaves remainder&nbsp;1. However, {{math|'''Z'''/12'''Z'''}} is not a field because 12 is not a prime number.]]\nThe simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using [[modular arithmetic]]. For a fixed positive integer {{math|''n''}}, arithmetic \"modulo {{math|''n''}}\" means to work with the numbers\n:{{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' = {0, 1, ..., ''n'' \u2212 1}.}}\nThe addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, dividing by {{math|''n''}} and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if {{math|''n''}} is a [[prime number]]. For example, taking the prime {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2}} results in the above-mentioned field {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}. For {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}} and more generally, for any [[composite number]] (i.e., any number {{math|''n''}} which can be expressed as a product {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r''\u22c5''s''}} of two strictly smaller natural numbers), {{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since {{math|1=''r''\u22c5''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} in {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}, which, as was explained [[#Consequences of the definition|above]], prevents {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} from being a field. The field {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}} with {{math|''p''}} elements ({{math|''p''}} being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\nEvery finite field {{math|''F''}} has {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements, where {{math|1=''p''}} is prime and {{math|''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1}}. This statement holds since {{math|''F''}} may be viewed as a [[vector space]] over its prime field. The [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of this vector space is necessarily finite, say {{math|''n''}}, which implies the asserted statement.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Lemma 2.1, Theorem 2.2}}</ref>\n\nA field with {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements can be constructed as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial \n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>''q''</sup> &minus; ''x''}}.\nSuch a splitting field is an extension of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} in which the polynomial {{math|''f''}} has {{math|''q''}} zeros. This means {{math|''f''}} has as many zeros as possible since the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|''q''}}. For {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}}, it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} satisfy the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''}}, so they are zeros of {{math|''f''}}. By contrast, in {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|''f''}} has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so {{math|''f''}} does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Theorem 1.2.5}}</ref> It is thus customary to speak of ''the'' finite field with {{math|''q''}} elements, denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} or {{math|GF(''q'')}}.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 63}}</ref> A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who observed that permuting the zeros {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>}} of a [[cubic polynomial]] in the expression\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub> + &omega;''x''<sub>2</sub> + &omega;<sup>2</sup>''x''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>3</sup>}}\n(with {{math|&omega;}} being a third [[root of unity]]) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]], which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown {{math|''x''}} to an quadratic equation for {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kiernan|1971|loc=p. 50}}</ref> Together with a similar observation for [[quartic polynomial|equations of degree 4]], Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=pp. 75\u201376}}</ref> [[Alexandre-Th\u00e9ophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), studied the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''p''</sup> = 1}}\nfor a prime {{math|''p''}} and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic [[Galois group]]. Gauss deduced that a [[regular polygon|regular {{math|''p''}}-gon]] can be constructed if {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup></sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}}. Building on Lagrange's work, [[Paolo Ruffini]] claimed (1799) that [[quintic equation]]s (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1824.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p.24}}</ref> [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as [[Galois theory]] today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an [[algebraic number field]], but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the [[German (language)|German]] word ''K\u00f6rper'', which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Moore|1893}}.<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html ''Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)'']</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=By a field we will mean every infinite system of real or complex numbers so closed in itself and perfect that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two of these numbers again yields a number of the system.\n|author=Richard Dedekind, 1871<ref>{{harvtxt|Dirichlet|1871|loc=p. 42}}, translation by {{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 66}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1881 [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a ''domain of rationality'', which is a field of [[rational fraction]]s in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as {{math|'''Q'''(&pi;)}} abstractly as the rational function field {{math|'''Q'''(''X'')}}. Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since [[Joseph Liouville]]'s work in 1844, until [[Charles Hermite]] (1873) and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] (1882) proved the transcendence of {{math|''e''}} and {{math|&pi;}}, respectively.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 81}}</ref>\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to {{harvtxt|Weber|1893}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p. 33}}. See also {{harvtxt|Fricke|Weber|1924}}.</ref> In particular, [[Heinrich Martin Weber]]'s notion included the field '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>. [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led {{harvtxt|Hensel|1904}} to introduce the field of ''p''-adic numbers. {{harvtxt|Steinitz|1910}} synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections [[#Galois theory|Galois theory]], [[#Constructing fields|Constructing fields]] and [[#Elementary notions|Elementary notions]] can be found in Steinitz's work. {{harvtxt|Artin|Schreier|1927}} linked the notion of [[ordered field|orderings in a field]], and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 92}}</ref> [[Emil Artin]] redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the [[primitive element theorem]].\n\n==Constructing fields==\n\n===Constructing fields from rings===\nA [[commutative ring]] is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses {{math|''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7II.1}}</ref> For example, the integers {{math|'''Z'''}} form a commutative ring, but not a field: the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of an integer {{math|''n''}} is not itself an integer, unless {{math|1=''n'' = \u00b11}}.\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings {{math|''R''}} in which every nonzero element is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are the commutative rings with precisely two distinct [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, {{math|(0)}} and {{math|''R''}}. Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which {{math|(0)}} is the only [[prime ideal]].\n\nGiven a commutative ring {{math|''R''}}, there are two ways to construct a field related to {{math|''R''}}, i.e., two ways of modifying {{math|''R''}} such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of {{math|'''Z'''}} is {{math|'''Q'''}}, the rationals, while the residue fields of {{math|'''Z'''}} are the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\n====Field of fractions====\n\nGiven an [[integral domain]] {{math|''R''}}, its [[field of fractions]] {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} is built with the fractions of two elements of {{math|''R''}} exactly as '''Q''' is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} are the fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are in {{math|''R''}}, and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. Two fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} and {{math|''c''/''d''}} are equal if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \n:<math>\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.</math>\nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 10.6}}</ref>\n\nThe field {{math|''F''(''x'')}} of the [[rational fraction]]s over a field (or an integral domain) {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''F''[''x'']}}. The field {{math|''F''((''x''))}} of [[Laurent series]]\n:<math>\\sum_{i=k}^\\infty a_i x^i \\ (k \\in \\Z, a_i \\in F)</math>\nover a field {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the ring {{math|''F''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''x'']]}} of [[formal power series]] (in which {{math|''k'' &ge; 0}}). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of {{math|''x''}} (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\n====Residue fields====\nIn addition to the field of fractions, which embeds {{math|''R''}} [[injective map|injectively]] into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring {{math|''R''}} by means of a [[surjective map]] onto a field {{math|''F''}}. Any field obtained in this way is a [[quotient ring|quotient]] {{math|{{nowrap|''R'' / ''m''}}}}, where {{math|''m''}} is a [[maximal ideal]] of {{math|''R''}}. If {{math|''R''}} [[local ring|has only one maximal ideal]] {{math|''m''}}, this field is called the [[residue field]] of {{math|''R''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=p. 60}}</ref>\n\nThe [[principal ideal|ideal generated by a single polynomial]] {{math|''f''}} in the polynomial ring {{math|1=''R'' = ''E''[''X'']}} (over a field {{math|''E''}}) is maximal if and only if {{math|''f''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in {{math|''E''}}, i.e., if {{math|''f''}} cannot be expressed as the product of two polynomials in {{math|''E''[''X'']}} of smaller [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]. This yields a field\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / (''f''(''X'')).}}\nThis field {{math|''F''}} contains an element {{math|''x''}} (namely the [[residue class]] of {{math|''X''}}) which satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}.\nFor example, {{math|'''C'''}} is obtained from {{math|'''R'''}} by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] the [[imaginary unit]] symbol {{mvar|i}}, which satisfies {{math|1=''f''(''i'') = 0}}, where {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}. Moreover, {{math|''f''}} is irreducible over {{math|'''R'''}}, which implies that the map that sends a polynomial {{math|''f''(''X'') \u220a '''R'''[''X'']}} to {{math|''f''(''i'')}} yields an isomorphism\n:<math>\\mathbf R[X]/\\left(X^2 + 1\\right) \\ \\stackrel \\cong \\longrightarrow \\ \\mathbf C.</math>\n\n===Constructing fields within a bigger field===\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field {{math|''E''}}, and a field {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} as a subfield. For any element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''F''}}, there is a smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''x''}}, called the subfield of ''F'' generated by {{math|''x''}} and denoted {{math|''E''(''x'')}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 213}}</ref> The passage from {{math|''E''}} to {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is referred to by ''[[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element'' to {{math|''E''}}. More generally, for a subset {{math|''S'' \u2282 ''F''}}, there is a minimal subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''S''}}, denoted by {{math|''E''(''S'')}}.\n\nThe [[compositum]] of two subfields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E' ''}} of some field {{math|''F''}} is the smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing both {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E'.''}} The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}} satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}}, which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over {{math|''E''}}.<ref group=nb>Further examples include the maximal [[unramified extension]] or the maximal [[abelian extension]] within {{math|''F''}}.</ref>\n\n===Field extensions===\n{{See|Glossary of field theory}}\nThe notion of a subfield {{math|''E'' \u2282 ''F''}} can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to {{math|''F''}} being a ''[[field extension]]'' (or just extension) of {{math|''E''}}, denoted by\n:{{math|''F'' / ''E''}},\nand read \"{{math|''F''}} over {{math|''E''}}\".\n\nA basic datum of a field extension is its [[degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|[''F'' : ''E'']}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''F''}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space. It satisfies the formula<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Theorem 13.3.4}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=[''G'' : ''E''] = [''G'' : ''F''] [''F'' : ''E'']}}.\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions {{math|'''C''' / '''R'''}} and {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub> / '''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} are of degree 2, whereas {{math|'''R''' / '''Q'''}} is an infinite extension.\n\n====Algebraic extensions====\nA pivotal notion in the study of field extensions {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} are [[algebraic element]]s. An element {{tmath|x\\in F}} is ''algebraic'' over {{mvar|E}} if it is a [[zero of a function|root]] of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in {{mvar|E}}, that is, if it satisfies a [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''e''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''e''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''e''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''e''<sub>0</sub> = 0}},\nwith {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>0</sub>}} in {{mvar|E}}, and {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub> &ne; 0}}. \nFor example, the [[imaginary unit]] {{math|''i''}} in {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraic over {{math|'''R'''}}, and even over {{math|'''Q'''}}, since it satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}.\nA field extension in which every element of {{math|''F''}} is algebraic over {{math|''E''}} is called an [[algebraic extension]]. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Corollary 13.3.6}}</ref>\n\nThe subfield {{math|''E''(''x'')}} generated by an element {{math|''x''}}, as above, is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} if and only if {{math|''x''}} is an algebraic element. That is to say, if {{math|''x''}} is algebraic, all other elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, equals the minimal degree {{math|''n''}} such that there is a polynomial equation involving {{math|''x''}}, as above. If this degree is {{math|''n''}}, then the elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} have the form \n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \\ \\ a_k \\in E.</math>\n\nFor example, the field {{math|'''Q'''(''i'')}} of [[Gaussian rational]]s is the subfield of {{math|'''C'''}} consisting of all numbers of the form {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are rational numbers: summands of the form {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup>}} (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since {{math|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''ci''<sup>2</sup>}} can be simplified to {{math|''a'' &minus; ''c'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n====Transcendence bases====\nThe above-mentioned field of [[rational fraction]]s {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, where {{math|''X''}} is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]], is not an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in {{math|''E''}} whose zero is {{math|''X''}}. Elements, such as {{math|''X''}}, which are not algebraic are called [[Algebraic element|transcendental]]. Informally speaking, the indeterminate {{math|''X''}} and its powers do not interact with elements of {{math|''E''}}. A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}} discussed above is a key example: if {{math|''x''}} is not algebraic (i.e., {{math|''x''}} is not a [[root of a function|root]] of a polynomial with coefficients in {{math|''E''}}), then {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. This isomorphism is obtained by substituting {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''X''}} in rational fractions.\n\nA subset {{math|''S''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a [[transcendence basis]] if it is [[algebraically independent]] (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over {{math|''E''}} and if {{math|''F''}} is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''(''S'')}}. Any field extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} has a transcendence basis.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter V, \u00a714, No. 2, Theorem 1}}</ref> Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form {{math|''E''(''S'') / ''E''}} ([[transcendental extension|purely transcendental extensions]]) and algebraic extensions.\n\n===Closure operations===\nA field is [[algebraically closed]] if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''f''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''f''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''f''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0}}, with [[coefficient]]s {{math|''f''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>0</sub> \u2208 ''F'', ''n'' > 0}},\nhas a solution {{math|''x'' \u220a ''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 13.9}}</ref> By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, i.e., ''any'' polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are ''not'' algebraically closed since the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing {{math|''F''}} is called an ''[[algebraic closure]]'' of {{math|''F''}} if it is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over {{math|''F''}} (roughly speaking, not too big compared to {{math|''F''}}) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above, {{math|'''C'''}} is an algebraic closure of {{math|'''R'''}}. The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field {{math|''F''}} is quite special: by the [[Artin-Schreier theorem]], the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and {{math|''F''}} is [[elementarily equivalent]] to {{math|'''R'''}}. Such fields are also known as [[real closed field]]s.\n\nAny field {{math|''F''}} has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as ''the'' algebraic closure and denoted {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}}. For example, the algebraic closure {{math|{{Overline|'''Q'''}}}} of {{math|'''Q'''}} is called the field of [[algebraic number]]s. The field {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}} is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the [[ultrafilter lemma]], a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Banaschewski|1992}}. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post]</ref> In this regard, the algebraic closure of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}, is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (the ones of order {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}}). For any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field {{math|''F''((''t''))}} of [[Laurent series]] is the field of [[Puiseux series]], obtained by adjoining roots of {{math|''t''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ribenboim|1999|loc=p. 186, \u00a77.1}}</ref>\n\n==Fields with additional structure==\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.\n\n===Ordered fields===\n{{main|Ordered field}}\nA field ''F'' is called an ''ordered field'' if any two elements can be compared, so that {{math|''x'' + ''y'' \u2265 0}} and {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} whenever {{math|''x''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} and {{math|''y''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}}.

The [[Artin-Schreier theorem]] states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a [[formally real field]], which means that any quadratic equation\n:<math>x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 = 0</math>\nonly has the solution {{math|1=''x''<sub>1</sub> = ''x''<sub>2</sub> = \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 = ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72.3, Corollary 1}}</ref> The set of all possible orders on a fixed field {{math|''F''}} is isomorphic to the set of [[ring homomorphism]]s from the [[Witt ring (forms)|Witt ring]] {{math|W(''F'')}} of [[quadratic form]]s over {{math|''F''}}, to {{math|'''Z'''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lorenz|2008|loc=\u00a722, Theorem 1}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Archimedean field]] is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\n:{{math|1 + 1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1}}\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements. Equivalently, the field contains no [[infinitesimals]] (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded real set has a least upper bound.]]\nAn ordered field is [[Dedekind-complete]] if all [[upper bound]]s, [[lower bound]]s (see [[Dedekind cut]]) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of {{math|''F''}} is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean,<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Proposition 1.22}}</ref> since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence {{math|1/2, 1/3, 1/4, &hellip;}}, every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, {{math|'''R'''}} is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Theorem 1.23}}</ref> Several foundational results in [[calculus]] follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe [[hyperreals]] {{math|'''R'''<sup>*</sup>}} form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of [[non-standard analysis]].\n\n===Topological fields===\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a [[topological field]], in which the set {{math|''F''}} is a [[topological space]], such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps {{math|''a'' \u21a6 &minus;''a''}} and {{math|''a'' \u21a6 ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}) are [[continuous map]]s with respect to the topology of the space.<ref>{{harvtxt|Warner|1989|loc=Chapter 14}}</ref>\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], i.e., a function\n:{{math|''d'' : ''F'' \u00d7 ''F'' \u2192 '''R''',}}\nthat measures a ''distance'' between any two elements of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of {{math|''F''}} is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field {{math|''F''}} are filled, if there are any. For example, any [[irrational number]] {{math|''x''}}, such as {{math|1=''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{radic|2}}}}, is a \"gap\" in the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers {{math|''p''/''q''}}, in the sense that distance of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''/''q''}} given by the [[absolute value]] {{math|{{!}} ''x'' \u2013 ''p''/''q'' {{!}}}} is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero [[sequence]], i.e., a sequence whose limit (for {{math|''n''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;\u221e}}) is zero.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Field !! Metric !!

The algebraic closure {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} carries a unique norm extending the one on {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is sometimes called the field of [[p-adic number|Metric completions and algebraic closures|complex p-adic number]]s and is denoted by {{math|'''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|1997|loc=\u00a75.7}}</ref>\n\n====Local fields====\nThe following topological fields are called ''[[local field]]s'':<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1979}}</ref><ref group=nb>Some authors also consider the fields {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} to be local fields. On the other hand, these two fields, also called Archimedean local fields, share little similarity with the local fields considered here, to a point that {{harvtxt|Cassels|1986|loc=p. vi}} calls them \"completely anomalous\".</ref>\n* finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} (local fields of characteristic zero)\n* finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, the field of Laurent series over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} (local fields of characteristic {{math|''p''}}).\n\nThese two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities. In this relation, the elements {{math|''p'' \u2208 '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|''t'' \u2208 '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}} (referred to as [[uniformizer]]) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}. (However, since the addition in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is done using [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]]ing, which is not the case in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n* Any [[first order logic|first order]] statement that is true for almost all {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is also true for almost all {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}. An application of this is the [[Ax-Kochen theorem]] describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n* [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|Tamely ramified extension]]s of both fields are in bijection to one another.\n* Adjoining arbitrary {{math|''p''}}-power roots of {{math|''p''}} (in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}), respectively of {{math|''t''}} (in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as [[perfectoid field]]s. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:<ref>{{harvtxt|Scholze|2014}}</ref>\n::<math>\\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf Q_p\\left(p^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf F_p((t))\\left(t^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right).</math>\n\n===Differential fields===\n[[Differential field]]s are fields equipped with a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field.<ref>{{harvtxt|van der Put|Singer|2003|loc=\u00a71}}</ref> For example, the field '''R'''(''X''), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to [[differential Galois theory]], a variant of Galois theory dealing with [[linear differential equation]]s.\n\n==Galois theory==\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n\nGalois theory studies [[algebraic extension]]s of a field by studying the [[Symmetry group#Symmetry groups in general|symmetry]] in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are [[finite extension|finite]] [[Galois extension]]s {{math|''F'' / ''E''}}, which are, by definition, those that are [[separable extension|separable]] and [[normal extension|normal]]. The [[primitive element theorem]] shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily [[simple extension|simple]], i.e., of the form\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / ''f''(''X'')}},\nwhere {{math|''f''}} is an irreducible polynomial (as above).<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Theorem V.4.6}}</ref> For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of {{math|''f''}} are contained in {{math|''F''}} and that {{math|''f''}} has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if {{math|''E''}} has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the [[Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} is the group of [[field automorphism]]s of {{math|''F''}} that are trivial on {{math|''E''}} (i.e., the [[bijection]]s {{math|\u03c3 : ''F'' \u2192 ''F''}} that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of {{math|''E''}} to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which constructs an explicit [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension {{math|''F''/''E''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7VI.1}}</ref> By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not [[solvable group|solvable]] (cannot be built from [[abelian group]]s), then the zeros of {{math|''f''}} ''cannot'' be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving <math>\\sqrt[n]{\\ }</math>. For example, the [[symmetric group]]s {{math|S<sub>''n''</sub>}} is not solvable for {{math|''n''&ge;5}}. Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]:\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>5</sup> &minus; 4''X'' + 2}} (and {{math|1=''E'' = '''Q'''}}),<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Example VI.2.6}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>''X''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} (where {{math|''f''}} is regarded as a polynomial in {{math|''E''(''a''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>)}}, for some indeterminates {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, {{math|''E''}} is any field, and {{math|''n'' &ge; 5}}).\n\nThe [[tensor product of fields]] is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} of degree {{math|''n''}} is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of {{math|''F''}}-algebras\n:{{math|''F'' \u2297<sub>''E''</sub> ''F'' \u2245 ''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\nThis fact is the beginning of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.<ref>{{harvtxt|Borceux|Janelidze|2001}}. See also [[\u00c9tale fundamental group]].</ref>\n\n==Invariants of fields==\n\nBasic invariants of a field {{math|''F''}} include the characteristic and the [[transcendence degree]] of {{math|''F''}} over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in {{math|''F''}} that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|2012|loc=Theorem 6.4.8}}</ref> This implies that any two [[uncountable]] algebraically closed fields of the same [[cardinality]] and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>, '''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are isomorphic (but ''not'' isomorphic as topological fields).\n\n===Model theory of fields===\nIn [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], two fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called [[elementarily equivalent]] if every mathematical statement that is true for {{math|''E''}} is also true for {{math|''F''}} and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\n:{{math|&phi;(''E'')}} = \"for any {{math|''n'' > 0}}, any polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''E''}} has a zero in {{math|''E''}}\" (which amounts to saying that {{math|''E''}} is algebraically closed).\nThe [[Lefschetz principle]] states that {{math|'''C'''}} is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement {{math|&phi;}} holds in {{math|'''C'''}} if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Marker|Messmer|Pillay|2006|loc=Corollary 1.2}}</ref>\n\nIf {{math|''U''}} is an [[ultrafilter]] on a set {{math|''I''}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a field for every {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''I''}}, the [[ultraproduct]] of the {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''U''}} is a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Schoutens|2002|loc=\u00a72}}</ref> It is denoted by\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''i''&rarr;\u221e</sub> ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}},\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}: [[\u0141o\u015b's theorem]] states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence {{math|&phi;}}, this shows that there is an isomorphism<ref group=nb>Both {{math|'''C'''}} and {{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> {{overline|'''F'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} are algebraically closed by \u0141o\u015b's theorem.

Finally, they are both uncountable, so that they are isomorphic.</ref>\n:<math>\\operatorname{ulim}_{p \\to \\infty} \\overline \\mathbf F_p \\cong \\mathbf C.</math>\nThe Ax\u2013Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes {{math|''p''}})\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> \u2245 ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}.\nIn addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as [[real closed field]]s or [[exponential field]]s (which are equipped with an exponential function {{math|exp : ''F'' &rarr; ''F''<sup>x</sup>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kuhlmann|2000}}</ref>\n\n===The absolute Galois group===\nFor fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the [[absolute Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F'')}} is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs ''all'' finite separable extensions of {{math|''F''}}. By elementary means, the group {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} can be shown to be the [[Pr\u00fcfer group]], the [[profinite completion]] of {{math|'''Z'''}}. This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} are the fields {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub>)}} for {{math|''n'' > 0}}, and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\n:{{math|1=Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub> / '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) = '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}.\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of {{math|''p''}}-adic number fields (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Jannsen|Wingberg|1982}}</ref>\n\n[[Galois representation|Representations of Galois groups]] and of related groups such as the [[Weil group]] are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the [[Langlands program]]. The cohomological study of such representations is done using [[Galois cohomology]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|2002}}</ref> For example, the [[Brauer group]], which is classically defined as the group of [[central simple algebra|central simple {{math|''F''}}-algebras]], can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely\n:{{math|1=Br(''F'') = H<sup>2</sup>(''F'', '''G'''<sub>m</sub>)}}.\n\n===K-theory===\n[[Milnor K-theory]] is defined as\n:<math>K_n^M(F) = F^\\times \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes F^\\times / \\langle x \\otimes (1-x)\\mid x \\in F \\smallsetminus \\{0, 1\\} \\rangle.</math>\nThe [[norm residue isomorphism theorem]], proved around 2000 by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]], relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism\n:<math>K_n^M(F) / p = H^n(F, \\mu_l^{\\otimes n}).</math>\n[[Algebraic K-theory]] is related to the group of [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the [[determinant (mathematics)|determinant]] of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K<sub>1</sub>(''F'') = ''F''<sup>&times;</sup>. [[Matsumoto's theorem (K-theory)|Matsumoto's theorem]] shows that K<sub>2</sub>(''F'') agrees with K<sub>2</sub><sup>M</sup>(''F''). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Linear algebra and commutative algebra===\n[[File:euler2a.gif|thumb|[[Euler angles]] express the relation of different coordinate systems, i.e., bases of {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}.

This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=\u00a73.3}}</ref> Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in [[linear algebra]] both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.\n\n[[module (mathematics)|Modules]] (the analogue of vector spaces) over most [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, including the ring {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring {{math|''R''}} is a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} in its own right. Such rings are called [[algebra over a field|{{math|''F''}}-algebras]] and are studied in depth in the area of [[commutative algebra]]. For example, [[Noether normalization]] asserts that any [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated {{math|''F''}}-algebra]] is closely related to (more precisely, [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as a module]] over) a polynomial ring {{math|''F''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>]}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Theorem 13.3}}</ref>\n\n===Finite fields: cryptography and coding theory===\n\n[[File:ECClines.svg|thumb|The sum of three points ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' on an elliptic curve ''E'' (red) is zero if there is a line (blue) passing through these points.]]\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''n''}} factors, for an integer {{math|''n'' \u2265 1}})\nin a (large) finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} can be performed much more efficiently than the [[discrete logarithm]], which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution {{math|''n''}} to an equation\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''b''}}.\nIn [[elliptic curve cryptography]], the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an [[elliptic curve]], i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n:{{math|1=''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''}}.\n\nFinite fields are also used in [[coding theory]] and [[combinatorics]].\n\n===Geometry: field of functions===\n[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A compact Riemann surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] two (two handles). The genus can be read off the field of meromorphic functions on the surface.]]\n[[function (mathematics)|Functions]] on a suitable [[topological space]] {{math|''X''}} into a field {{mvar|k}} can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:\n:{{math|1={{nowrap|1=(''f'' \u22c5 ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u22c5 ''g''(''x'')}}}}.\nThis makes these functions a {{mvar|k}}-[[associative algebra|commutative algebra]].\n\nFor having a ''field'' of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are [[integral domains]]. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form\n:<math>\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},</math>\nform a field, called field of functions.\n\nThis occurs in two main cases. When {{math|''X''}} is a [[complex manifold]] {{math|''X''}}. In this case, one considers the algebra of [[holomorphic functions]], i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of [[meromorphic function]]s on {{math|''X''}}.\n\nThe [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of an [[algebraic variety]] {{math|''X''}} (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of [[regular function]]s, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[affine space|space]] over a field {{math|''k''}} is {{math|''k''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in {{math|''n''}} indeterminates. The function field of {{math|''X''}} is the same as the one of any [[Zariski topology|open]] dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing {{math|''X''}} by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field is invariant under [[isomorphism]] and [[birational equivalence]] of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of [[abstract algebraic variety|abstract algebraic varieties]] and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]], which equals the transcendence degree of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}, is invariant under birational equivalence.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=\u00a713, Theorem A}}</ref> For [[algebraic curve|curves]] (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field {{math|''k''(''X'')}} is very close to {{math|''X''}}: if {{math|''X''}} is [[smooth variety|smooth]] and [[proper map|proper]] (the analogue of being [[compact topological space|compact]]), {{math|''X''}} can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions.<ref group=nb>More precisely, there is an [[equivalence of categories]] between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} and finite field extensions of {{math|''F''(''T'')}}.</ref> In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about {{math|''X''}}. The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as [[birational geometry]]. The [[minimal model program]] attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\n===Number theory: global fields===\n\n[[Global field]]s are in the limelight in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]].\nThey are, by definition, [[number field]]s (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''}}) or function fields over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'')}}). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This [[function field analogy]] can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] concerning the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the [[Weil conjectures]] (proven in 1974 by [[Pierre Deligne]]).\n\n[[File:One5Root.svg|thumb|The fifth roots of unity form a [[regular pentagon]].]]\n[[Cyclotomic field]]s are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where {{math|\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}-th [[root of unity]], i.e., a complex number satisfying {{math|1={{nowrap begin}}\u03b6<sup>''n''</sup> = 1{{nowrap end}}}} and {{math|\u03b6<sup>''m''</sup> \u2260 1}} for all {{math|''m'' < ''n''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Washington|1997}}</ref> For {{math|''n''}} being a [[regular prime]], [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] used cyclotomic fields to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''y''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''z''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. [[Ostrowski's theorem]] asserts that the only completions of {{math|'''Q'''}}, a global field, are the local fields {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''R'''}}. Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the [[local-global principle]]. For example, the [[Hasse\u2013Minkowski theorem]] reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, whose solutions can easily be described.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1978|loc=Chapter IV}}</ref>\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. [[Inverse Galois theory]] studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group {{math|Gal(''F''/'''Q''')}} for some number field {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1992}}</ref> [[Class field theory]] describes the [[abelian extension]]s, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]], describes the maximal abelian {{math|'''Q'''<sup>ab</sup>}} extension of {{math|'''Q'''}}: it is the field\n:{{math|'''Q'''(&zeta;<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n'' &ge; 2)}}\nobtained by adjoining all primitive {{math|''n''}}-th roots of unity. [[Kronecker Jugendtraum|Kronecker's Jugendtraum]] asks for a similarly explicit description of {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} of general number fields {{math|''F''}}. For [[imaginary quadratic field]]s, <math>F=\\mathbf Q(\\sqrt{-d})</math>, {{math|''d'' > 0}}, the theory of [[complex multiplication]] describes {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} using [[elliptic curves]]. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\n==Related notions==\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 &ne; 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of [[field with one element]], which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, as {{math|''p''}} tends to 1.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tits|1957}}</ref> In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as [[quasifield]]s, [[Near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s and [[semifield]]s.\n\nThere are also [[proper class]]es with field structure, which are sometimes called '''Fields''', with a capital F. The [[surreal number]]s form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The [[nimber]]s, a concept from [[game theory]], form such a Field as well.<ref>{{harvtxt|Conway|1976}}</ref>\n\n===Division rings===\n[[File:Hairy_ball.png|thumb|The hairy ball theorem states that a ball cannot be combed. More formally, there is no [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[tangent bundle|tangent vector field]] on the [[sphere]] {{math|S<sup>2</sup>}}, which is everywhere non-zero.]]\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a ''[[division ring]]'' or ''skew field''.<ref group=nb>Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called ''commutative fields''.</ref> The only division rings that are finite-dimensional {{math|'''R'''}}-vector spaces are {{math|'''R'''}} itself, {{math|'''C'''}} (which is a field), the [[quaternion]]s {{math|'''H'''}} (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the [[octonion]]s {{math|'''O'''}} (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of [[algebraic topology]] in 1958 by [[Michel Kervaire]], [[Raoul Bott]], and [[John Milnor]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Baez|2002}}</ref> The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical. It can be deduced from the [[hairy ball theorem]] illustrated at the right.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Wikibooks|Abstract algebra|Fields}}\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Citation|title=Introduction to Field Theory| last=Adamson|first=I.

A field is thus a fundamental [[algebraic structure]] which is widely used in [[algebra]], [[number theory]], and many other areas of mathematics.\n\nThe best known fields are the field of [[rational number]]s, the field of [[real number]]s and the field of [[complex number]]s. Many other fields, such as [[field of rational functions|fields of rational functions]], [[algebraic function field]]s, [[algebraic number field]]s, and [[p-adic number|''p''-adic fields]] are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and [[algebraic geometry]]. Most [[cryptographic protocol]]s rely on [[finite field]]s, i.e., fields with finitely many [[element (set)|elements]].\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a [[field extension]]. [[Galois theory]], initiated by [[\u00c9variste Galois]] in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that [[angle trisection]] and [[squaring the circle]] cannot be done with a [[compass and straightedge]]. Moreover, it shows that [[quintic equation]]s are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of [[mathematical analysis]], which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] for a [[vector space]], which is the standard general context for [[linear algebra]]. [[Number field]]s, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in [[number theory]]. [[Function field of an algebraic variety|Function fields]] can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\n== Definition ==\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two [[binary operation|operation]]s defined on that set: an addition operation written as {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}, and a multiplication operation written as {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}, both of which behave similarly as they behave for [[rational number]]s and [[real number]]s, including the existence of an [[additive inverse]] {{math|&minus;''a''}} for all elements {{mvar|a}}, and of a [[multiplicative inverse]] {{math|''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}} for every nonzero element {{mvar|b}}. This allows one to also consider the so-called ''inverse'' operations of [[Subtraction#Real numbers|subtraction]], {{math|''a'' &minus; ''b''}}, and [[Division (mathematics)|division]], {{math|''a'' / ''b''}}, by defining:\n:{{math|1=''a'' &minus; ''b'' = ''a'' + (&minus;''b'')}},\n:{{math|1=''a'' / ''b'' = ''a'' \u00b7 ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.\n\n===Classic definition===\n\nFormally, a field is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''F''}} together with two [[binary operation]]s on {{mvar|F}} called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=Definition 4.1.1, p.&nbsp;181}}</ref> A binary operation on {{mvar|F}} is a mapping {{math|''F'' &times; ''F'' &rarr; ''F''}}, that is, a correspondence that associates with each ordered pair of elements of ''F'' a uniquely determined element of {{mvar|F}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=16}}</ref> The result of the addition of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the sum of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the product of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as ''[[Axiom#Non-logical axioms|field axioms]]''. In these axioms, {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are arbitrary [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the field {{mvar|F}}.\n\n* [[Associativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' \u00b7 ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') \u00b7 ''c''}}.\n* [[Commutativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''b'' = ''b'' \u00b7 ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive identity|Additive]] and [[multiplicative identity]]: there exist two different elements {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} in {{math|''F''}} such that {{math|1=''a'' + 0 = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 1 = ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted {{math|\u2212''a''}}, called the ''additive inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' + (\u2212''a'') = 0}}.\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted by {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} or {{math|1/''a''}}, called the ''multiplicative inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> = 1}}.\n* [[Distributivity]] of multiplication over addition: {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') + (''a'' \u00b7 ''c'')}}.\n\nThis may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called addition and multiplication; it is an [[abelian group]] under addition with 0 as the additive identity; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under multiplication with 1 as the multiplicative identity; and multiplication distributes over addition.\n\n===Alternative definition===\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and their required properties. [[Division by zero]] is, by definition, excluded.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clark|1984|loc=Chapter 3}}.</ref> In order to avoid [[existential quantifier]]s, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses respectively), and two [[arity#Nullary|nullary]] operations (the constants {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[computing]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Mines|Richman|Ruitenburg|1988|loc=\u00a7II.2}}. See also [[Heyting field]].</ref> One may equivalently define a field by the same two binary operations, one unary operation (the multiplicative inverse), and two constants {{math|1}} and {{math|\u22121}}, since {{math|1=0 = 1 + (\u22121)}} and {{math|1=&minus;''a'' = (&minus;1)''a''}}.<ref group=nb>The a priori twofold use of the symbol \"\u2212\" for denoting one part of a constant and for the additive inverses is justified by this latter condition.</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Rational numbers===\n{{main|Rational number}}\nRational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.\nThey are numbers that can be written as [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]\n{{math|''a''/''b''}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are [[integer]]s, and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. The additive inverse of such a fraction is {{math|\u2212''a''/''b''}}, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}) is {{math|''b''/''a''}}, which can be seen as follows:\n\n: <math> \\frac b a \\cdot \\frac a b = \\frac{ba}{ab} = 1.</math>\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac a b \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d + \\frac e f \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b  \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d  \\cdot \\frac f f + \\frac e f \\cdot \\frac d d \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{cf}{df} + \\frac{ed}{fd}\\right) = \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{cf + ed}{df} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} = \\frac{acf}{bdf} +  \\frac{aed}{bdf} = \\frac{ac}{bd} +  \\frac{ae}{bf} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac c d + \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac e f.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Real and complex numbers===\n\n[[File:Complex_multi.svg|thumb|255px|The multiplication of complex numbers can be visualized geometrically by rotations and scalings.]]\n\n{{main|Real number| Complex number}}\nThe [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}} consist of expressions\n:{{math|''a'' + ''bi'',}} with {{math|''a'', ''b''}} real,\nwhere {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for {{math|'''C'''}}. For example, the distributive law enforces\n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''bi'')(''c'' + ''di'') = ''ac'' + ''bci'' + ''adi'' + ''bdi''<sup>2</sup> = ''ac''\u2212''bd'' + (''bc'' + ''ad'')''i''.}}\nIt is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], with [[Cartesian coordinates]] given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is &ndash;less intuitively&ndash; combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\n[[File:Root_construction_geometric_mean5.svg|thumb|255px|The [[geometric mean theorem]] asserts that {{math|1=''h''<sup>2</sup> = ''pq''}}. Choosing {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1}} allows construction of the square root of a given constructible number {{math|''p''}}.]]\n{{main|Constructible numbers}}\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with [[compass and straightedge]]. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle in this way. These problems can be settled using the field of [[constructible numbers]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Chapter 13.4}}</ref> Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only [[compass]] and [[straightedge]]. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of [[square root]]s of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within {{math|'''Q'''}}. Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments {{math|''AB''}}, {{math|''BD''}}, and a [[semicircle]] over {{math|''AD''}} (center at the [[midpoint]] {{math|''C''}}), which intersects the [[perpendicular]] line through {{math|''B''}} in a point {{math|''F''}}, at a distance of exactly <math>h=\\sqrt p</math> from {{math|''B''}} when {{math|''BD''}} has length one.\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that <math>\\sqrt[3] 2</math> is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a [[Doubling the cube|cube with volume 2]], another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\n===A field with four elements===\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center;\"| Addition\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center'\"| Multiplication\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| + !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|}\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| \u00b7 !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|}\n|}\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called {{math|''O''}}, {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''B''}}. The notation is chosen such that {{math|''O''}} plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\n: {{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 (''B'' + ''A'') = ''A'' \u00b7 ''I'' = ''A''}}, which equals {{nowrap|1={{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 ''B'' + ''A'' \u00b7 ''A'' = ''I'' + ''B'' = ''A''}}}}, as required by the distributivity.\n\nThis field is called a [[finite field]] with four elements, and is denoted {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} or {{math|GF(4)}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Example 1.62}}</ref> The subset consisting of {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the ''[[binary field]]'' {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} or {{math|GF(2)}}. In the context of [[computer science]] and [[Boolean algebra]], {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} are often denoted respectively by ''false'' and ''true'', the addition is then denoted [[XOR]] (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted [[Bitwise AND|AND]]. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with [[bit]]s.\n\n==Elementary notions==\nIn this section, {{math|''F''}} denotes an arbitrary field and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary [[element (set theory)|elements]] of {{math|''F''}}.\n\n===Consequences of the definition===\nOne has {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 0 = 0}} and {{math|1=\u2212''a'' = (\u22121) \u00b7 ''a''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref> In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows {{math|\u20131}}.\n\nIf {{math|1=''ab'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''a''}} or {{math|''b''}} must be 0. Indeed, if ''a''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;0, then \n{{math|1=0 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>\u22c50 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>(''ab'') = (''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>''a'')''b'' = ''b''}}. This means that every field is an [[integral domain]].\n\n===The additive and the multiplicative group of a field===\nThe axioms of a field {{math|''F''}} imply that it is an [[abelian group]] under addition. This group is called the [[additive group]] of the field, and is sometimes denoted by {{math|(''F'', +)}} when denoting it simply as {{math|''F''}} could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the ''nonzero'' elements of {{math|''F''}} form an abelian group under multiplication, called the [[multiplicative group]], and denoted by {{math|(''F'' \\ {0}, \u00b7)}} or just {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} or {{math|''F''<sup>*</sup>}}. \n\nA field may thus be defined as set {{math|''F''}} equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that {{math|''F''}} is an abelian group under addition, {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] over addition.<ref group=nb>Equivalently, a field is an [[algebraic structure]] {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u00b7, \u2212, <sup>\u22121</sup>, 0, 1\u27e9}} of type {{math|\u27e82, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0\u27e9}}, such that {{math|0<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is not defined, {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u2013, 0\u27e9}} and \n{{math|\u27e8''F'' \u2216 {0}, \u00b7, <sup>\u22121</sup>\u27e9}} are abelian groups, and \n\u00b7 is distributive over +. {{harvtxt|Wallace|1998|loc=Th. 2}}</ref> Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses {{math|\u2212''a''}} and {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''a''}}.\n\nThe requirement {{math|1 \u2260 0}} follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sharpe|1987|loc=Theorem 1.3.2}}</ref> Thus, the [[trivial ring]], consisting of a single element, is not a field.\n\nEvery finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] (see {{slink|Root of unity|Cyclic groups}}).\n\n===Characteristic===\nIn addition to the multiplication of two elements of ''F'', it is possible to define the product {{math|''n'' \u22c5 ''a''}} of an arbitrary element {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''F''}} by a positive [[integer]] {{math|''n''}} to be the {{math|''n''}}-fold sum\n:{{math|''a'' + ''a'' + ... + ''a''}} (which is an element of {{math|''F''}}.)\n\nIf there is no positive integer such that\n:{{math|1=''n'' \u22c5 1 = 0}},\nthen {{math|''F''}} is said to have [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=\u00a7I.2, p.&nbsp;10}}</ref> For example, the field of rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} has characteristic 0 since no positive integer {{math|''n''}} is zero. Otherwise, if there ''is'' a positive integer {{math|''n''}} satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a [[prime number]]. It is usually denoted by {{math|''p''}} and the field is said to have characteristic {{math|''p''}} then.\nFor example, the field {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) {{math| 1= I + I = O }}.\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} has characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''p'' \u22c5 ''a'' = 0}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}. This implies that \n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')<sup>''p''</sup> = ''a''<sup>''p''</sup> + ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>}},\nsince all other [[binomial coefficient]]s appearing in the [[binomial formula]] are divisible by {{math|''p''}}. Here, {{math|1=''a''<sup>''p''</sup> := ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''p''}} factors) is the {{math|''p''}}-th power, i.e., the {{math|''p''}}-fold product of the element {{math|''a''}}. Therefore, the [[Frobenius map]]\n:{{math|Fr: ''F'' &rarr; ''F'', ''x'' \u27fc ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>}}\nis compatible with the addition in {{math|''F''}} (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Escofier|2012|loc=14.4.2}}</ref> The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic {{math|''p''}} quite different from fields of characteristic 0.\n\n===Subfields and prime fields===\nA ''[[Field extension|subfield]]'' {{math|''E''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that is a field with respect to the field operations of {{math|''F''}}. Equivalently {{math|''E''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that contains {{math|1}}, and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that {{math|1 \u220a ''E''}}, that for all {{math|''a'', ''b'' \u220a ''E''}} both {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' \u00b7 ''b''}} are in {{math|''E''}}, and that for all {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''E''}}, both {{math|\u2013''a''}} and {{math|1/''a''}} are in {{math|''E''}}.\n\n[[Field homomorphism]]s are maps {{math|''f'': ''E'' &rarr; ''F''}} between two fields such that {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub> + ''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>) + ''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>)''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, and {{math|1=''f''(1<sub>E</sub>) = 1<sub>F</sub>}}, where {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''e''<sub>2</sub>}} are arbitrary elements of {{math|''E''}}.

Any field {{math|''F''}} contains a prime field. If the characteristic of {{math|''F''}} is {{math|''p''}} (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} introduced below.

The above introductory example {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} is a field with four elements.

However, {{math|'''Z'''/12'''Z'''}} is not a field because 12 is not a prime number.]]\nThe simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using [[modular arithmetic]]. For a fixed positive integer {{math|''n''}}, arithmetic \"modulo {{math|''n''}}\" means to work with the numbers\n:{{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' = {0, 1, ..., ''n'' \u2212 1}.}}\nThe addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, dividing by {{math|''n''}} and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if {{math|''n''}} is a [[prime number]]. For example, taking the prime {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2}} results in the above-mentioned field {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}. For {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}} and more generally, for any [[composite number]] (i.e., any number {{math|''n''}} which can be expressed as a product {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r''\u22c5''s''}} of two strictly smaller natural numbers), {{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since {{math|1=''r''\u22c5''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} in {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}, which, as was explained [[#Consequences of the definition|above]], prevents {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} from being a field. The field {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}} with {{math|''p''}} elements ({{math|''p''}} being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\nEvery finite field {{math|''F''}} has {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements, where {{math|1=''p''}} is prime and {{math|''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1}}. This statement holds since {{math|''F''}} may be viewed as a [[vector space]] over its prime field. The [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of this vector space is necessarily finite, say {{math|''n''}}, which implies the asserted statement.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Lemma 2.1, Theorem 2.2}}</ref>\n\nA field with {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements can be constructed as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial \n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>''q''</sup> &minus; ''x''}}.\nSuch a splitting field is an extension of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} in which the polynomial {{math|''f''}} has {{math|''q''}} zeros. This means {{math|''f''}} has as many zeros as possible since the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|''q''}}. For {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}}, it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} satisfy the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''}}, so they are zeros of {{math|''f''}}. By contrast, in {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|''f''}} has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so {{math|''f''}} does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Theorem 1.2.5}}</ref> It is thus customary to speak of ''the'' finite field with {{math|''q''}} elements, denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} or {{math|GF(''q'')}}.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 63}}</ref> A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who observed that permuting the zeros {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>}} of a [[cubic polynomial]] in the expression\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub> + &omega;''x''<sub>2</sub> + &omega;<sup>2</sup>''x''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>3</sup>}}\n(with {{math|&omega;}} being a third [[root of unity]]) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]], which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown {{math|''x''}} to an quadratic equation for {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kiernan|1971|loc=p. 50}}</ref> Together with a similar observation for [[quartic polynomial|equations of degree 4]], Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=pp. 75\u201376}}</ref> [[Alexandre-Th\u00e9ophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), studied the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''p''</sup> = 1}}\nfor a prime {{math|''p''}} and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic [[Galois group]]. Gauss deduced that a [[regular polygon|regular {{math|''p''}}-gon]] can be constructed if {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup></sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}}. Building on Lagrange's work, [[Paolo Ruffini]] claimed (1799) that [[quintic equation]]s (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1824.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p.24}}</ref> [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as [[Galois theory]] today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an [[algebraic number field]], but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the [[German (language)|German]] word ''K\u00f6rper'', which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Moore|1893}}.<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html ''Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)'']</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=By a field we will mean every infinite system of real or complex numbers so closed in itself and perfect that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two of these numbers again yields a number of the system.\n|author=Richard Dedekind, 1871<ref>{{harvtxt|Dirichlet|1871|loc=p. 42}}, translation by {{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 66}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1881 [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a ''domain of rationality'', which is a field of [[rational fraction]]s in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as {{math|'''Q'''(&pi;)}} abstractly as the rational function field {{math|'''Q'''(''X'')}}. Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since [[Joseph Liouville]]'s work in 1844, until [[Charles Hermite]] (1873) and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] (1882) proved the transcendence of {{math|''e''}} and {{math|&pi;}}, respectively.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 81}}</ref>\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to {{harvtxt|Weber|1893}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p. 33}}. See also {{harvtxt|Fricke|Weber|1924}}.</ref> In particular, [[Heinrich Martin Weber]]'s notion included the field '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>. [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led {{harvtxt|Hensel|1904}} to introduce the field of ''p''-adic numbers. {{harvtxt|Steinitz|1910}} synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections [[#Galois theory|Galois theory]], [[#Constructing fields|Constructing fields]] and [[#Elementary notions|Elementary notions]] can be found in Steinitz's work. {{harvtxt|Artin|Schreier|1927}} linked the notion of [[ordered field|orderings in a field]], and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 92}}</ref> [[Emil Artin]] redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the [[primitive element theorem]].\n\n==Constructing fields==\n\n===Constructing fields from rings===\nA [[commutative ring]] is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses {{math|''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7II.1}}</ref> For example, the integers {{math|'''Z'''}} form a commutative ring, but not a field: the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of an integer {{math|''n''}} is not itself an integer, unless {{math|1=''n'' = \u00b11}}.\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings {{math|''R''}} in which every nonzero element is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are the commutative rings with precisely two distinct [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, {{math|(0)}} and {{math|''R''}}. Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which {{math|(0)}} is the only [[prime ideal]].\n\nGiven a commutative ring {{math|''R''}}, there are two ways to construct a field related to {{math|''R''}}, i.e., two ways of modifying {{math|''R''}} such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of {{math|'''Z'''}} is {{math|'''Q'''}}, the rationals, while the residue fields of {{math|'''Z'''}} are the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\n====Field of fractions====\n\nGiven an [[integral domain]] {{math|''R''}}, its [[field of fractions]] {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} is built with the fractions of two elements of {{math|''R''}} exactly as '''Q''' is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} are the fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are in {{math|''R''}}, and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. Two fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} and {{math|''c''/''d''}} are equal if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \n:<math>\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.</math>\nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 10.6}}</ref>\n\nThe field {{math|''F''(''x'')}} of the [[rational fraction]]s over a field (or an integral domain) {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''F''[''x'']}}. The field {{math|''F''((''x''))}} of [[Laurent series]]\n:<math>\\sum_{i=k}^\\infty a_i x^i \\ (k \\in \\Z, a_i \\in F)</math>\nover a field {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the ring {{math|''F''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''x'']]}} of [[formal power series]] (in which {{math|''k'' &ge; 0}}). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of {{math|''x''}} (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\n====Residue fields====\nIn addition to the field of fractions, which embeds {{math|''R''}} [[injective map|injectively]] into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring {{math|''R''}} by means of a [[surjective map]] onto a field {{math|''F''}}. Any field obtained in this way is a [[quotient ring|quotient]] {{math|{{nowrap|''R'' / ''m''}}}}, where {{math|''m''}} is a [[maximal ideal]] of {{math|''R''}}. If {{math|''R''}} [[local ring|has only one maximal ideal]] {{math|''m''}}, this field is called the [[residue field]] of {{math|''R''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=p. 60}}</ref>\n\nThe [[principal ideal|ideal generated by a single polynomial]] {{math|''f''}} in the polynomial ring {{math|1=''R'' = ''E''[''X'']}} (over a field {{math|''E''}}) is maximal if and only if {{math|''f''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in {{math|''E''}}, i.e., if {{math|''f''}} cannot be expressed as the product of two polynomials in {{math|''E''[''X'']}} of smaller [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]. This yields a field\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / (''f''(''X'')).}}\nThis field {{math|''F''}} contains an element {{math|''x''}} (namely the [[residue class]] of {{math|''X''}}) which satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}.\nFor example, {{math|'''C'''}} is obtained from {{math|'''R'''}} by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] the [[imaginary unit]] symbol {{mvar|i}}, which satisfies {{math|1=''f''(''i'') = 0}}, where {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}. Moreover, {{math|''f''}} is irreducible over {{math|'''R'''}}, which implies that the map that sends a polynomial {{math|''f''(''X'') \u220a '''R'''[''X'']}} to {{math|''f''(''i'')}} yields an isomorphism\n:<math>\\mathbf R[X]/\\left(X^2 + 1\\right) \\ \\stackrel \\cong \\longrightarrow \\ \\mathbf C.</math>\n\n===Constructing fields within a bigger field===\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field {{math|''E''}}, and a field {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} as a subfield. For any element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''F''}}, there is a smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''x''}}, called the subfield of ''F'' generated by {{math|''x''}} and denoted {{math|''E''(''x'')}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 213}}</ref> The passage from {{math|''E''}} to {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is referred to by ''[[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element'' to {{math|''E''}}. More generally, for a subset {{math|''S'' \u2282 ''F''}}, there is a minimal subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''S''}}, denoted by {{math|''E''(''S'')}}.\n\nThe [[compositum]] of two subfields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E' ''}} of some field {{math|''F''}} is the smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing both {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E'.''}} The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}} satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}}, which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over {{math|''E''}}.<ref group=nb>Further examples include the maximal [[unramified extension]] or the maximal [[abelian extension]] within {{math|''F''}}.</ref>\n\n===Field extensions===\n{{See|Glossary of field theory}}\nThe notion of a subfield {{math|''E'' \u2282 ''F''}} can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to {{math|''F''}} being a ''[[field extension]]'' (or just extension) of {{math|''E''}}, denoted by\n:{{math|''F'' / ''E''}},\nand read \"{{math|''F''}} over {{math|''E''}}\".\n\nA basic datum of a field extension is its [[degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|[''F'' : ''E'']}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''F''}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space. It satisfies the formula<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Theorem 13.3.4}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=[''G'' : ''E''] = [''G'' : ''F''] [''F'' : ''E'']}}.\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions {{math|'''C''' / '''R'''}} and {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub> / '''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} are of degree 2, whereas {{math|'''R''' / '''Q'''}} is an infinite extension.\n\n====Algebraic extensions====\nA pivotal notion in the study of field extensions {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} are [[algebraic element]]s. An element {{tmath|x\\in F}} is ''algebraic'' over {{mvar|E}} if it is a [[zero of a function|root]] of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in {{mvar|E}}, that is, if it satisfies a [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''e''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''e''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''e''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''e''<sub>0</sub> = 0}},\nwith {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>0</sub>}} in {{mvar|E}}, and {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub> &ne; 0}}. \nFor example, the [[imaginary unit]] {{math|''i''}} in {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraic over {{math|'''R'''}}, and even over {{math|'''Q'''}}, since it satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}.\nA field extension in which every element of {{math|''F''}} is algebraic over {{math|''E''}} is called an [[algebraic extension]]. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Corollary 13.3.6}}</ref>\n\nThe subfield {{math|''E''(''x'')}} generated by an element {{math|''x''}}, as above, is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} if and only if {{math|''x''}} is an algebraic element. That is to say, if {{math|''x''}} is algebraic, all other elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, equals the minimal degree {{math|''n''}} such that there is a polynomial equation involving {{math|''x''}}, as above. If this degree is {{math|''n''}}, then the elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} have the form \n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \\ \\ a_k \\in E.</math>\n\nFor example, the field {{math|'''Q'''(''i'')}} of [[Gaussian rational]]s is the subfield of {{math|'''C'''}} consisting of all numbers of the form {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are rational numbers: summands of the form {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup>}} (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since {{math|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''ci''<sup>2</sup>}} can be simplified to {{math|''a'' &minus; ''c'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n====Transcendence bases====\nThe above-mentioned field of [[rational fraction]]s {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, where {{math|''X''}} is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]], is not an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in {{math|''E''}} whose zero is {{math|''X''}}. Elements, such as {{math|''X''}}, which are not algebraic are called [[Algebraic element|transcendental]]. Informally speaking, the indeterminate {{math|''X''}} and its powers do not interact with elements of {{math|''E''}}. A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}} discussed above is a key example: if {{math|''x''}} is not algebraic (i.e., {{math|''x''}} is not a [[root of a function|root]] of a polynomial with coefficients in {{math|''E''}}), then {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. This isomorphism is obtained by substituting {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''X''}} in rational fractions.\n\nA subset {{math|''S''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a [[transcendence basis]] if it is [[algebraically independent]] (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over {{math|''E''}} and if {{math|''F''}} is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''(''S'')}}. Any field extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} has a transcendence basis.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter V, \u00a714, No. 2, Theorem 1}}</ref> Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form {{math|''E''(''S'') / ''E''}} ([[transcendental extension|purely transcendental extensions]]) and algebraic extensions.\n\n===Closure operations===\nA field is [[algebraically closed]] if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''f''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''f''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''f''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0}}, with [[coefficient]]s {{math|''f''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>0</sub> \u2208 ''F'', ''n'' > 0}},\nhas a solution {{math|''x'' \u220a ''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 13.9}}</ref> By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, i.e., ''any'' polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are ''not'' algebraically closed since the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing {{math|''F''}} is called an ''[[algebraic closure]]'' of {{math|''F''}} if it is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over {{math|''F''}} (roughly speaking, not too big compared to {{math|''F''}}) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above, {{math|'''C'''}} is an algebraic closure of {{math|'''R'''}}. The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field {{math|''F''}} is quite special: by the [[Artin-Schreier theorem]], the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and {{math|''F''}} is [[elementarily equivalent]] to {{math|'''R'''}}. Such fields are also known as [[real closed field]]s.\n\nAny field {{math|''F''}} has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as ''the'' algebraic closure and denoted {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}}. For example, the algebraic closure {{math|{{Overline|'''Q'''}}}} of {{math|'''Q'''}} is called the field of [[algebraic number]]s. The field {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}} is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the [[ultrafilter lemma]], a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Banaschewski|1992}}. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post]</ref> In this regard, the algebraic closure of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}, is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (the ones of order {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}}). For any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field {{math|''F''((''t''))}} of [[Laurent series]] is the field of [[Puiseux series]], obtained by adjoining roots of {{math|''t''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ribenboim|1999|loc=p. 186, \u00a77.1}}</ref>\n\n==Fields with additional structure==\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.\n\n===Ordered fields===\n{{main|Ordered field}}\nA field ''F'' is called an ''ordered field'' if any two elements can be compared, so that {{math|''x'' + ''y'' \u2265 0}} and {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} whenever {{math|''x''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} and {{math|''y''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}}. For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering&nbsp;{{math|\u2265}}. The [[Artin-Schreier theorem]] states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a [[formally real field]], which means that any quadratic equation\n:<math>x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 = 0</math>\nonly has the solution {{math|1=''x''<sub>1</sub> = ''x''<sub>2</sub> = ... = ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72.3, Corollary 1}}</ref> The set of all possible orders on a fixed field {{math|''F''}} is isomorphic to the set of [[ring homomorphism]]s from the [[Witt ring (forms)|Witt ring]] {{math|W(''F'')}} of [[quadratic form]]s over {{math|''F''}}, to {{math|'''Z'''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lorenz|2008|loc=\u00a722, Theorem 1}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Archimedean field]] is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\n:{{math|1 + 1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1}}\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements. Equivalently, the field contains no [[infinitesimals]] (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded real set has a least upper bound.]]\nAn ordered field is [[Dedekind-complete]] if all [[upper bound]]s, [[lower bound]]s (see [[Dedekind cut]]) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of {{math|''F''}} is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean,<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Proposition 1.22}}</ref> since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence {{math|1/2, 1/3, 1/4, &hellip;}}, every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, {{math|'''R'''}} is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Theorem 1.23}}</ref> Several foundational results in [[calculus]] follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe [[hyperreals]] {{math|'''R'''<sup>*</sup>}} form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of [[non-standard analysis]].\n\n===Topological fields===\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a [[topological field]], in which the set {{math|''F''}} is a [[topological space]], such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps {{math|''a'' \u21a6 &minus;''a''}} and {{math|''a'' \u21a6 ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}) are [[continuous map]]s with respect to the topology of the space.<ref>{{harvtxt|Warner|1989|loc=Chapter 14}}</ref>\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], i.e., a function\n:{{math|''d'' : ''F'' \u00d7 ''F'' \u2192 '''R''',}}\nthat measures a ''distance'' between any two elements of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of {{math|''F''}} is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field {{math|''F''}} are filled, if there are any. For example, any [[irrational number]] {{math|''x''}}, such as {{math|1=''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{radic|2}}}}, is a \"gap\" in the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers {{math|''p''/''q''}}, in the sense that distance of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''/''q''}} given by the [[absolute value]] {{math|{{!}} ''x'' \u2013 ''p''/''q'' {{!}}}} is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero [[sequence]], i.e., a sequence whose limit (for {{math|''n''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;\u221e}}) is zero.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Field !! Metric !!

The algebraic closure {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} carries a unique norm extending the one on {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is sometimes called the field of [[p-adic number|Metric completions and algebraic closures|complex p-adic number]]s and is denoted by {{math|'''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|1997|loc=\u00a75.7}}</ref>\n\n====Local fields====\nThe following topological fields are called ''[[local field]]s'':<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1979}}</ref><ref group=nb>Some authors also consider the fields {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} to be local fields.

In this relation, the elements {{math|''p'' \u2208 '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|''t'' \u2208 '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}} (referred to as [[uniformizer]]) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}. (However, since the addition in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is done using [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]]ing, which is not the case in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n* Any [[first order logic|first order]] statement that is true for almost all {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is also true for almost all {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}. An application of this is the [[Ax-Kochen theorem]] describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n* [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|Tamely ramified extension]]s of both fields are in bijection to one another.\n* Adjoining arbitrary {{math|''p''}}-power roots of {{math|''p''}} (in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}), respectively of {{math|''t''}} (in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as [[perfectoid field]]s. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:<ref>{{harvtxt|Scholze|2014}}</ref>\n::<math>\\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf Q_p\\left(p^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf F_p((t))\\left(t^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right).</math>\n\n===Differential fields===\n[[Differential field]]s are fields equipped with a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field.<ref>{{harvtxt|van der Put|Singer|2003|loc=\u00a71}}</ref> For example, the field '''R'''(''X''), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to [[differential Galois theory]], a variant of Galois theory dealing with [[linear differential equation]]s.\n\n==Galois theory==\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n\nGalois theory studies [[algebraic extension]]s of a field by studying the [[Symmetry group#Symmetry groups in general|symmetry]] in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are [[finite extension|finite]] [[Galois extension]]s {{math|''F'' / ''E''}}, which are, by definition, those that are [[separable extension|separable]] and [[normal extension|normal]]. The [[primitive element theorem]] shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily [[simple extension|simple]], i.e., of the form\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / ''f''(''X'')}},\nwhere {{math|''f''}} is an irreducible polynomial (as above).<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Theorem V.4.6}}</ref> For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of {{math|''f''}} are contained in {{math|''F''}} and that {{math|''f''}} has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if {{math|''E''}} has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the [[Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} is the group of [[field automorphism]]s of {{math|''F''}} that are trivial on {{math|''E''}} (i.e., the [[bijection]]s {{math|\u03c3 : ''F'' \u2192 ''F''}} that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of {{math|''E''}} to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which constructs an explicit [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension {{math|''F''/''E''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7VI.1}}</ref> By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not [[solvable group|solvable]] (cannot be built from [[abelian group]]s), then the zeros of {{math|''f''}} ''cannot'' be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving <math>\\sqrt[n]{\\ }</math>. For example, the [[symmetric group]]s {{math|S<sub>''n''</sub>}} is not solvable for {{math|''n''&ge;5}}. Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]:\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>5</sup> &minus; 4''X'' + 2}} (and {{math|1=''E'' = '''Q'''}}),<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Example VI.2.6}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>''X''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} (where {{math|''f''}} is regarded as a polynomial in {{math|''E''(''a''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>)}}, for some indeterminates {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, {{math|''E''}} is any field, and {{math|''n'' &ge; 5}}).\n\nThe [[tensor product of fields]] is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} of degree {{math|''n''}} is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of {{math|''F''}}-algebras\n:{{math|''F'' \u2297<sub>''E''</sub> ''F'' \u2245 ''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\nThis fact is the beginning of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.<ref>{{harvtxt|Borceux|Janelidze|2001}}. See also [[\u00c9tale fundamental group]].</ref>\n\n==Invariants of fields==\n\nBasic invariants of a field {{math|''F''}} include the characteristic and the [[transcendence degree]] of {{math|''F''}} over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in {{math|''F''}} that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|2012|loc=Theorem 6.4.8}}</ref> This implies that any two [[uncountable]] algebraically closed fields of the same [[cardinality]] and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>, '''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are isomorphic (but ''not'' isomorphic as topological fields).\n\n===Model theory of fields===\nIn [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], two fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called [[elementarily equivalent]] if every mathematical statement that is true for {{math|''E''}} is also true for {{math|''F''}} and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\n:{{math|&phi;(''E'')}} = \"for any {{math|''n'' > 0}}, any polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''E''}} has a zero in {{math|''E''}}\" (which amounts to saying that {{math|''E''}} is algebraically closed).\nThe [[Lefschetz principle]] states that {{math|'''C'''}} is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement {{math|&phi;}} holds in {{math|'''C'''}} if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Marker|Messmer|Pillay|2006|loc=Corollary 1.2}}</ref>\n\nIf {{math|''U''}} is an [[ultrafilter]] on a set {{math|''I''}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a field for every {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''I''}}, the [[ultraproduct]] of the {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''U''}} is a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Schoutens|2002|loc=\u00a72}}</ref> It is denoted by\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''i''&rarr;\u221e</sub> ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}},\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}: [[\u0141o\u015b's theorem]] states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence {{math|&phi;}}, this shows that there is an isomorphism<ref group=nb>Both {{math|'''C'''}} and {{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> {{overline|'''F'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} are algebraically closed by \u0141o\u015b's theorem. For the same reason, they both have characteristic zero. Finally, they are both uncountable, so that they are isomorphic.</ref>\n:<math>\\operatorname{ulim}_{p \\to \\infty} \\overline \\mathbf F_p \\cong \\mathbf C.</math>\nThe Ax\u2013Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes {{math|''p''}})\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> \u2245 ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}.\nIn addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as [[real closed field]]s or [[exponential field]]s (which are equipped with an exponential function {{math|exp : ''F'' &rarr; ''F''<sup>x</sup>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kuhlmann|2000}}</ref>\n\n===The absolute Galois group===\nFor fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the [[absolute Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F'')}} is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs ''all'' finite separable extensions of {{math|''F''}}. By elementary means, the group {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} can be shown to be the [[Pr\u00fcfer group]], the [[profinite completion]] of {{math|'''Z'''}}. This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} are the fields {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub>)}} for {{math|''n'' > 0}}, and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\n:{{math|1=Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub> / '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) = '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}.\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of {{math|''p''}}-adic number fields (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Jannsen|Wingberg|1982}}</ref>\n\n[[Galois representation|Representations of Galois groups]] and of related groups such as the [[Weil group]] are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the [[Langlands program]]. The cohomological study of such representations is done using [[Galois cohomology]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|2002}}</ref> For example, the [[Brauer group]], which is classically defined as the group of [[central simple algebra|central simple {{math|''F''}}-algebras]], can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely\n:{{math|1=Br(''F'') = H<sup>2</sup>(''F'', '''G'''<sub>m</sub>)}}.\n\n===K-theory===\n[[Milnor K-theory]] is defined as\n:<math>K_n^M(F) = F^\\times \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes F^\\times / \\langle x \\otimes (1-x)\\mid x \\in F \\smallsetminus \\{0, 1\\} \\rangle.</math>\nThe [[norm residue isomorphism theorem]], proved around 2000 by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]], relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism\n:<math>K_n^M(F) / p = H^n(F, \\mu_l^{\\otimes n}).</math>\n[[Algebraic K-theory]] is related to the group of [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the [[determinant (mathematics)|determinant]] of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K<sub>1</sub>(''F'') = ''F''<sup>&times;</sup>. [[Matsumoto's theorem (K-theory)|Matsumoto's theorem]] shows that K<sub>2</sub>(''F'') agrees with K<sub>2</sub><sup>M</sup>(''F''). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Linear algebra and commutative algebra===\n[[File:euler2a.gif|thumb|[[Euler angles]] express the relation of different coordinate systems, i.e., bases of {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}. They are used in computer graphics.]]\nIf {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}, then the [[equation]] \n:{{math|1=''ax'' = ''b''}}\nhas a unique solution {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''F''}}, namely {{math|1=''x'' = ''b''/''a''}}. This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=\u00a73.3}}</ref> Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in [[linear algebra]] both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.\n\n[[module (mathematics)|Modules]] (the analogue of vector spaces) over most [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, including the ring {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring {{math|''R''}} is a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} in its own right. Such rings are called [[algebra over a field|{{math|''F''}}-algebras]] and are studied in depth in the area of [[commutative algebra]]. For example, [[Noether normalization]] asserts that any [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated {{math|''F''}}-algebra]] is closely related to (more precisely, [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as a module]] over) a polynomial ring {{math|''F''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>]}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Theorem 13.3}}</ref>\n\n===Finite fields: cryptography and coding theory===\n\n[[File:ECClines.svg|thumb|The sum of three points ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' on an elliptic curve ''E'' (red) is zero if there is a line (blue) passing through these points.]]\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''n''}} factors, for an integer {{math|''n'' \u2265 1}})\nin a (large) finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} can be performed much more efficiently than the [[discrete logarithm]], which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution {{math|''n''}} to an equation\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''b''}}.\nIn [[elliptic curve cryptography]], the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an [[elliptic curve]], i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n:{{math|1=''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''}}.\n\nFinite fields are also used in [[coding theory]] and [[combinatorics]].\n\n===Geometry: field of functions===\n[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A compact Riemann surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] two (two handles). The genus can be read off the field of meromorphic functions on the surface.]]\n[[function (mathematics)|Functions]] on a suitable [[topological space]] {{math|''X''}} into a field {{mvar|k}} can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:\n:{{math|1={{nowrap|1=(''f'' \u22c5 ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u22c5 ''g''(''x'')}}}}.\nThis makes these functions a {{mvar|k}}-[[associative algebra|commutative algebra]].\n\nFor having a ''field'' of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are [[integral domains]]. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form\n:<math>\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},</math>\nform a field, called field of functions.\n\nThis occurs in two main cases. When {{math|''X''}} is a [[complex manifold]] {{math|''X''}}. In this case, one considers the algebra of [[holomorphic functions]], i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of [[meromorphic function]]s on {{math|''X''}}.\n\nThe [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of an [[algebraic variety]] {{math|''X''}} (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of [[regular function]]s, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[affine space|space]] over a field {{math|''k''}} is {{math|''k''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in {{math|''n''}} indeterminates. The function field of {{math|''X''}} is the same as the one of any [[Zariski topology|open]] dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing {{math|''X''}} by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field is invariant under [[isomorphism]] and [[birational equivalence]] of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of [[abstract algebraic variety|abstract algebraic varieties]] and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]], which equals the transcendence degree of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}, is invariant under birational equivalence.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=\u00a713, Theorem A}}</ref> For [[algebraic curve|curves]] (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field {{math|''k''(''X'')}} is very close to {{math|''X''}}: if {{math|''X''}} is [[smooth variety|smooth]] and [[proper map|proper]] (the analogue of being [[compact topological space|compact]]), {{math|''X''}} can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions.<ref group=nb>More precisely, there is an [[equivalence of categories]] between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} and finite field extensions of {{math|''F''(''T'')}}.</ref> In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about {{math|''X''}}. The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as [[birational geometry]]. The [[minimal model program]] attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\n===Number theory: global fields===\n\n[[Global field]]s are in the limelight in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]].\nThey are, by definition, [[number field]]s (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''}}) or function fields over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'')}}). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This [[function field analogy]] can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] concerning the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the [[Weil conjectures]] (proven in 1974 by [[Pierre Deligne]]).\n\n[[File:One5Root.svg|thumb|The fifth roots of unity form a [[regular pentagon]].]]\n[[Cyclotomic field]]s are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where {{math|\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}-th [[root of unity]], i.e., a complex number satisfying {{math|1={{nowrap begin}}\u03b6<sup>''n''</sup> = 1{{nowrap end}}}} and {{math|\u03b6<sup>''m''</sup> \u2260 1}} for all {{math|''m'' < ''n''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Washington|1997}}</ref> For {{math|''n''}} being a [[regular prime]], [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] used cyclotomic fields to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''y''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''z''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. [[Ostrowski's theorem]] asserts that the only completions of {{math|'''Q'''}}, a global field, are the local fields {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''R'''}}. Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the [[local-global principle]]. For example, the [[Hasse\u2013Minkowski theorem]] reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, whose solutions can easily be described.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1978|loc=Chapter IV}}</ref>\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. [[Inverse Galois theory]] studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group {{math|Gal(''F''/'''Q''')}} for some number field {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1992}}</ref> [[Class field theory]] describes the [[abelian extension]]s, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]], describes the maximal abelian {{math|'''Q'''<sup>ab</sup>}} extension of {{math|'''Q'''}}: it is the field\n:{{math|'''Q'''(&zeta;<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n'' &ge; 2)}}\nobtained by adjoining all primitive {{math|''n''}}-th roots of unity. [[Kronecker Jugendtraum|Kronecker's Jugendtraum]] asks for a similarly explicit description of {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} of general number fields {{math|''F''}}. For [[imaginary quadratic field]]s, <math>F=\\mathbf Q(\\sqrt{-d})</math>, {{math|''d'' > 0}}, the theory of [[complex multiplication]] describes {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} using [[elliptic curves]]. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\n==Related notions==\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 &ne; 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of [[field with one element]], which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, as {{math|''p''}} tends to 1.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tits|1957}}</ref> In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as [[quasifield]]s, [[Near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s and [[semifield]]s.\n\nThere are also [[proper class]]es with field structure, which are sometimes called '''Fields''', with a capital F. The [[surreal number]]s form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The [[nimber]]s, a concept from [[game theory]], form such a Field as well.<ref>{{harvtxt|Conway|1976}}</ref>\n\n===Division rings===\n[[File:Hairy_ball.png|thumb|The hairy ball theorem states that a ball cannot be combed. More formally, there is no [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[tangent bundle|tangent vector field]] on the [[sphere]] {{math|S<sup>2</sup>}}, which is everywhere non-zero.]]\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a ''[[division ring]]'' or ''skew field''.<ref group=nb>Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called ''commutative fields''.</ref> The only division rings that are finite-dimensional {{math|'''R'''}}-vector spaces are {{math|'''R'''}} itself, {{math|'''C'''}} (which is a field), the [[quaternion]]s {{math|'''H'''}} (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the [[octonion]]s {{math|'''O'''}} (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of [[algebraic topology]] in 1958 by [[Michel Kervaire]], [[Raoul Bott]], and [[John Milnor]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Baez|2002}}</ref> The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
