Eventually Oates's intricate web of accusations fell apart, leading to his arrest and conviction for [[perjury]].\n\n== Background ==\n===Development of English anti-Catholicism===\nThe fictitious Popish Plot must be understood against the background of the [[English Reformation]] and the subsequent development of a strong [[anti-catholicism|anti-Catholic]] sentiment among the mostly [[Protestant]] population of England.\n\nThe [[English Reformation]] began in 1533, when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] (1509\u20131547) sought an annulment of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] to marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. As the [[Pope]] would not grant this, Henry broke away from Rome and took control of the [[Church in England]]. Later, he had the monasteries dissolved, causing opposition in the still largely [[Catholicism|Catholic]] nation. Under Henry's son [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] (1547\u20131553), the Church of England was transformed into a strictly Protestant body, with many remnants of Catholicism suppressed. Edward was succeeded by his half-sister [[Mary I of England]] (1553\u20131558), daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine. She was a Catholic and returned the Church in England to union with the [[Holy See]]. Mary tainted her policy by two unpopular actions: she married her cousin, [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II of Spain]], where the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] continued, and had 300 Protestants burned at the stake, causing many Englishmen to associate Catholicism with the involvement of foreign powers and religious persecution.\n\nMary was succeeded by her Protestant half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (1558\u20131603), who again broke away from Rome and suppressed Catholicism. Elizabeth and later Protestant monarchs hanged and mutilated hundreds of Catholic priests and laymen. This, and her dubious legitimacy \u2013 she was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn \u2013 led to Catholic powers not recognising her as queen and favouring her next relative, the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Elizabeth's reign saw Catholic rebellions like the [[Rising of the North]] (1569) as well as plots like the [[Roberto di Ridolfi|Ridolfi Plot]] (1571) or the [[Babington Plot]] (1586), both intending to kill Elizabeth and replace her with Mary with the help of a Spanish invasion. Three popes' interventions, in [[ Regnans in Excelsis |a papal bull]] with its subsequent suspension and reimposition, gave grounds to suspect English Catholics' loyalty. Following the Babington Plot Mary was beheaded in 1587. This \u2013 and Elizabeth's support of the [[Dutch Revolt]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] \u2013 triggered Philip II of Spain's attempted invasion with the [[Spanish Armada]] (1588). This reinforced the impression that Catholicism was a foreign element, while the Armada's failure, largely due to unfavorable weather, convinced many Englishmen that God was supportive of Protestantism.\n\nAnti-Catholic sentiment reached new heights in 1605 after the [[Gunpowder Plot]] was discovered. Catholic plotters attempted to topple the Protestant regime of [[James VI and I|King James I]] by blowing up both King and parliament during the state opening of parliament. However, [[Guy Fawkes]], who was in charge of the explosives, was discovered the night before and the attempt thwarted. The magnitude of the plot \u2013 had it succeeded most leading government figures would have been killed in one stroke \u2013 convinced many Englishmen that Catholics were devious conspirators who would stop at nothing to have their way, thus making allegations about Catholic plots more believable.\n\n===Anti-Catholicism in the 17th century===\nAnti-Catholic sentiment was a constant factor in how England perceived the events of the following decades: the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618\u20131648) was seen as an attempt by the Catholic Habsburgs to exterminate German Protestantism. Under the early Stuart Kings, fears of Catholic conspiracies were rampant and the policies of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] \u2013 especially his church policies, which had a decidedly [[high church]] bent \u2013 were seen as pro-Catholic and likely induced by a Catholic conspiracy headed by Charles' Catholic queen, [[Henrietta Maria of France]]. This, together with accounts of Catholic atrocities in Ireland in 1641, triggered the [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131649), which led to the abolition of the monarchy and a decade of Puritan rule, which espoused religious tolerance for most forms of Protestantism but not for Catholicism. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660 under [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] brought with it a reaction against all religious dissenters, i.e. all outside the [[ State religion #Anglicanism |established]] Church of England. As a result, Catholics felt popular hostility and legal discrimination.\n\nAnti-Catholic hysteria flared up lightly during the reign of Charles II, which saw various disasters such as the [[Great Plague of London]] (1665) and the [[Great Fire of London]] (1666). After the latter, rumors and [[A True Narrative of the Horrid Hellish Popish-Plot|propaganda]] floated around about arson, with Catholics and especially [[Jesuits]] as the first to be blamed. Kenyon remarks, \"At Coventry, the townspeople were possessed by the idea that the papists were about to rise and cut their throats ...A nationwide panic seemed likely, and as homeless refugees poured out from London into the countryside, they took with them stories of a kind which were familiar to them in 1678 and 1679.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=10}}\n\nAnti-Catholicism was fueled by doubts about the religious allegiance of the King, who had married a Catholic princess, [[Catherine of Braganza|Catherine of Portugal]], and formed an alliance with France, then the leading Catholic power in Europe, against the Protestant Netherlands. Furthermore, Charles' brother and heir presumptive, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], had embraced Catholicism, although his brother forbade him to make any public announcement. In 1672, Charles issued the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], in which he suspended all [[English Penal Laws|penal law]]s against Catholics and other religious dissenters.<ref>Fraser, pp. 305\u201308; Hutton, pp. 284\u201385.{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}</ref> This resulted in growing fears by Protestants of increasing Catholic influence in England and led to [[Charles II of England#Conflict with Parliament|conflict with parliament]] during the 1670s. In December 1677 an anonymous pamphlet (possibly by [[Andrew Marvell]]) spread alarm in London by suggesting that the Pope planned to change the lawful government of England.{{sfn|Heald|1992|p=603}}\n\n==Events==\n===Beginnings===\nThe fictitious Popish Plot unfolded in a very peculiar fashion. Oates and [[Israel Tonge]], a fanatically anti-Catholic clergyman (who was widely believed to be insane), had written a large manuscript that accused the [[Catholic Church]] authorities of approving the assassination of Charles II. The [[Jesuit]]s in England were to carry out the task. The manuscript also named nearly 100 Jesuits and their supporters who were supposedly involved in this assassination plot; nothing in the document was ever proven to be true.\n\nOates slipped a copy of the manuscript into the [[wainscot]] of a gallery in the house of the [[physician]] Sir Richard Barker, with whom Tonge was living.{{sfn|Pollock|2005|p=13}} The following day Tonge claimed to find the manuscript, and showed it to an acquaintance, Christopher Kirkby, who was shocked and decided to inform the King. Kirkby was a [[chemist]] and a former assistant in Charles' scientific experiments, and Charles prided himself on being approachable to the general public.<ref name=Tonge>{{cite book |author= Alan Marshall |chapter= Tonge, Israel (1621\u20131680) |title= [[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2004}}</ref> On 13 August 1678, whilst Charles was out walking in [[St. James's Park]], the chemist informed him of the plot.<ref>{{cite book |author= Molly Brown |title= The Invitation to a Funeral |publisher= Saint Martin's Press |year= 1999 |isbn= 9780312970949}}</ref> Charles was dismissive but Kirkby stated that he knew the names of assassins who planned to shoot the King and, if that failed, the Queen's physician, [[Sir George Wakeman]], would poison him. When the King demanded proof, the chemist offered to bring Tonge who knew of these matters personally. The King did agree to see both Kirkby and Tonge that evening, when he gave them a short audience. At this stage he was already sceptical, but he was apparently not ready to rule out the possibility that there might be a plot of some sort (otherwise, Kenyon argues, he would not have given these two very obscure men a private audience). Charles told Kirkby to present Tonge to [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Thomas Osborne, Lord Danby]], [[Lord High Treasurer]], then the most influential of the King's ministers.<ref name=Danby>{{cite book |author= Mark Knights |chapter= Osborne, Thomas, first duke of Leeds (1632\u20131712) |title= [[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2004}}</ref> Tonge then lied to Danby, saying that he had found the manuscript but did not know the author.\n\n===Investigations===\nAs Kenyon points out, the government took seriously even the remotest hint of a threat to the King's life or well-being \u2013 in the previous spring a Newcastle housewife had been investigated by the Secretary of State simply for saying that \"the King gets the curse of many good and faithful wives such as myself for his bad example\".{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=61}} Danby, who seems to have believed in the Plot, advised the King to order an investigation. Charles II denied the request, maintaining that the entire affair was absurd. He told Danby to keep the events secret so as not to put the idea of [[regicide]] into people's minds.{{sfn|Pollock|2005|p=73\u201374}} However, word of the manuscript spread to the Duke of York, who publicly called for an investigation into the matter.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|pp=68\u201369}} Even Charles admitted that given the sheer number of allegations, he could not be certain that none of them was true, and reluctantly agreed. During the investigation, Oates' name arose. From the first the King was convinced that Oates was a liar, and Oates did not help his case by claiming to have met the regent of [[Spain]], [[John of Austria the Younger|Don John of Austria]]. Questioned by the King, who had met Don John in [[Brussels]] in 1656, it became obvious that Oates had no idea what he looked like.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=80}} The King had a long and frank talk with [[Paul Barillon]], the French ambassador, in which he made it clear that he did not believe that there was a word of truth in the plot, and that Oates was \"a wicked man\"; but that by now he had come round to the view that there must be an investigation, particularly with Parliament about to reassemble.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=84}}\n\nOn 6 September Oates was summoned before the magistrate [[Edmund Berry Godfrey|Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey]] to swear an oath prior to his testimony before the King. Oates claimed he had been at a [[Jesuit]] meeting held at the White Horse Tavern in the [[Strand, London]] on April 24, 1678.<ref name=\"Williams\">{{cite journal |author= Sheila Williams |title= The Pope-Burning Processions of 1679, 1680 and 1681 |journal= Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |year= 1958 |pages= 104\u201318 }}</ref> According to Oates, the purpose of that meeting was to discuss the assassination of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. The meeting discussed a variety of methods which included: stabbing by Irish ruffians, shooting by two Jesuit soldiers, or poisoning by the Queen's physician, [[George Wakeman|Sir George Wakeman]].<ref name=\"Williams\"/>\n\nOates and Tonge were brought before the [[Privy Council]] later that month, and the Council interrogated Oates for several hours; Tonge, who was generally believed to be mad, was simply laughed at, but Oates made a much better impression on the Council. On 28 September Oates made 43 allegations against various members of Catholic [[religious order]]s \u2013 including 541 Jesuits \u2013 and numerous Catholic nobles. He accused [[Sir George Wakeman]] and [[Edward Colman]], the secretary to [[Mary of Modena]] [[Duchess of York]], of planning the assassination. Colman was found to have corresponded with the French [[Jesuit]] Fr Ferrier, confessor to [[Louis XIV]], outlining his grandiose schemes for obtaining a dissolution of the present Parliament, in the hope of its replacement by a new and pro-French Parliament; in the wake of this revelation he was condemned to death for [[treason]]. Wakeman was later acquitted. Despite Oates' unsavoury reputation, the councillors were impressed by his confidence, his grasp of detail and his remarkable memory. A turning point came when he was shown five letters, supposedly written by well-known priests and giving details of the plot, which he was suspected of forging: Oates \"at a single glance\" named each of the alleged authors. At this the Council were \"amazed\" and began to give much greater credence to the plot; apparently it did not occur to them that Oates' ability to recognise the letters made it ''more'' likely, rather than less, that he had forged them.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=79}}\n\nOthers Oates accused included Dr. [[William Fogarty]], [[Archbishop Peter Talbot]] of [[Dublin]], [[Samuel Pepys]] and [[John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse]]. The list grew to 81 accusations. Oates was given a squad of soldiers and he began to round up Jesuits.\n\n===Godfrey's murder===\nThe allegations gained little credence until the murder of [[Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey]], a member of Parliament and strong supporter of Protestantism, to whom Oates had made his first depositions. His disappearance on 12 October 1678, the finding of his mutilated body on 17 October, and the subsequent failure to solve his murder sent the Protestant population into an uproar. He had been strangled and run through with his own sword. Many of his supporters blamed the murder on Catholics. As Kenyon commented, \"Next day, the 18th, James wrote to William of Orange that Godfrey's death was already 'laid against the Catholics', and even he, never the most realistic of men, feared that 'all these things happening together will cause a great flame in the Parliament.'\"{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=78}} The Lords asked King Charles to banish all Catholics from a radius of 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) around London, which Charles granted on October 30, 1678, but it was too late because London was already in a panic, which was long remembered as \"Godfrey's autumn\".\n\nOates seized on Godfrey's murder as proof that the plot was true. The murder of Godfrey and the discovery of Edward Coleman's letters<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5871?docPos=2 |title= Article 5871 |work= [[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref> provided a solid basis of facts for the lies of Oates and the other informers who followed him. Oates was called to testify before the House of Lords and the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] on October 23, 1678. He testified that he had seen a number of contracts signed by the Superior General of the Jesuits. The contracts appointed officers that would command an army of Catholic supporters to kill Charles II and establish a Catholic monarch.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|pp=78\u201381}} To this day, no one is certain who killed Sir Edmund Godfrey, and most historians regard the mystery as insoluble. Oates' associate [[William Bedloe]] denounced the silversmith [[Miles Prance]], who in turn named three working men, Berry, Green and Hill, who were tried, convicted and executed in February 1679; but it rapidly became clear that they were completely innocent, and that Prance, who had been subjected to [[torture]], named them simply to gain his freedom (Kenyon suggests that he may have chosen men against whom he had a personal grudge, or he may simply have chosen them because they were the first Catholics acquaintances of his who came to mind).\n\n===The Plot before Parliament===\nKing Charles, aware of the unrest, returned to London and summoned [[List of Parliaments of England#Parliaments of Charles II|Parliament]]. He remained unconvinced by Oates' accusations, but Parliament and public opinion forced him to order an investigation. Parliament truly believed that this plot was real, declaring, \"This House is of opinion that there hath been and still is a damnable and hellish plot contrived and carried out by the popish recusants for assigning and murdering the King.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|pp=84\u201385}} Tonge was called to testify on October 25, 1678 where he gave evidence on the Great Fire and, later, rumours of another similar plot. On November 1, both Houses ordered an investigation in which a Frenchman, Choqueux, was discovered to be storing [[gunpowder]] in a house nearby. This caused a panic, until it was discovered that he was simply the King's [[firework]] maker.\n\n===Trial of the Five Catholic Lords===\nOates became more daring and accused five Catholic lords ([[William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis]], [[William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford]], [[Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour]], [[William Petre, 4th Baron Petre]] and [[John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse]]) of involvement in the plot. The King dismissed the accusations as absurd, pointing out that Belasyse was so afflicted with [[gout]] that he could hardly stand, while Arundell and Stafford, who had not been on speaking terms for 25 years, were most unlikely to be intriguing together; but [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]] had the lords arrested and sent to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] on 25 October 1678. Seizing upon the anti-Catholic tide, Shaftesbury publicly demanded that the King's brother, James, be excluded from the [[royal succession]], prompting the [[Exclusion crisis]]. On 5 November 1678, people burned effigies of the [[Pope]] instead of those of [[Guy Fawkes]].<ref name=\"Williams\"/> At the end of the year, the parliament passed a bill, a second [[Test Act]], excluding Catholics from membership of both Houses (a law not repealed until 1829).\n\nOn 1 November 1678, the House of Commons resolved to proceed by impeachment against \"the five popish lords\". On 23 November all Arundell's papers were seized and examined by the Lords' committee; on 3 December the five peers were arraigned for [[high treason]]; and on 5 December the Commons announced the impeachment of Arundell. A month later Parliament was dissolved, and the proceedings were interrupted. In March 1679, it was resolved by both houses that the dissolution had not invalidated the motions for the impeachment. On 10 April 1679 Arundell and three of his companions (Belasyse was too ill to attend) were brought to the House of Lords to put in pleas against the articles of impeachment. Arundell complained of the uncertainty of the charges, and implored the peers to have them \"reduced to competent certainty\". But on 24 April this plea was voted irregular, and on 26 April the prisoners were again brought to the House of Lords and ordered to amend their pleas. Arundell replied by briefly declaring himself not guilty.\n\nThe trial was fixed for 13 May, but a quarrel between the two houses as to points of procedure, and the legality of admitting the bishops as judges in a capital trial, followed by a dissolution, delayed its commencement until 30 November 1680. On that day it was decided to proceed first against Lord Stafford, who was condemned to death on 7 December and beheaded on 29 December.<ref>{{cite book |author= Peter Holmes |chapter= Howard, William, Viscount Stafford (1612\u20131680) |title= [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2004}}</ref> His trial, compared to the other Plot trials, was reasonably fair, but as in all cases of alleged treason at that date the absence of defence counsel was a fatal handicap, and while Oates' credit had been seriously damaged, the evidence of the principal prosecution witnesses, Turberville and Dugdale, struck even fair minded observers like [[John Evelyn]] as being credible enough. Stafford, denied counsel, failed to exploit several inconsistencies in Tuberville's testimony, which a good lawyer might have turned to his client's advantage.\n\nOn 30 December, the evidence against Arundell and his three fellow-prisoners was ordered to be in readiness, but their public proceedings stopped. In fact the death of William Bedloe left the prosecution in serious difficulties, since one protection for a person accused of treason, that there must be two eyewitnesses to an overt act of treason, was observed scrupulously, and only Oates claimed to have any hard evidence against the remaining Lords. Lord Petre died in the Tower in 1683. His companions remained there until 12 February 1684 when an appeal to the [[Court of King's Bench]] to release them on bail was successful. On 21 May 1685 Arundell, Powis, and Belasyse came to the House of Lords to present petitions for the annulling of the charges and on the following day the petitions were granted. On 1 June 1685 their liberty was formally assured on the ground that the witnesses against them had perjured themselves, and on 4 June the [[bill of attainder]] against Stafford was reversed.<ref>{{DNB|wstitle=Arundell, Henry (DNB00)|prescript=}}</ref>\n\n===Height of the hysteria===\n[[File:Houghton EB65 A100 680s4 - Popish Plot, solemn mock procession, 1679.jpg|thumb|Broadside, \"The Solemn Mock Procession of the POPE, Cardinalls, Iesuits, Fryers etc: through y<sup>e</sup> City of London, November y<sup>e</sup> 17th. 1679.\"]]\nOn 24 November 1678, Oates claimed the Queen was working with the King's physician to poison him and enlisted the aid of \"Captain\" [[William Bedloe]], a notorious member of the London underworld. The King personally interrogated Oates, caught him out in a number of inaccuracies and lies, and ordered his arrest. However, a few days later, with the threat of constitutional crisis, Parliament forced the release of Oates.\n\nHysteria continued: [[Roger North (lawyer)|Roger North]] wrote that it was as though \"the very Cabinet of Hell has been opened\". Noblewomen carried firearms if they had to venture outdoors at night. Houses were searched for hidden guns, mostly without any significant result. Some Catholic widows tried to ensure their safety by marrying [[Anglican]] widowers. The House of Commons was searched \u2013 without result \u2013 in the expectation of a second [[Gunpowder Plot]].\n\nAnyone even suspected of being Catholic was driven out of London and forbidden to be within ten miles (16&nbsp;km) of the city. [[William Staley]], a young Catholic banker, made a drunken threat against the King and within 10 days was tried, convicted and executed for plotting to kill him. Oates, for his part, received a state apartment in [[Whitehall]] and an annual allowance. He soon presented new allegations, claiming assassins intended to shoot the King with silver bullets so the wound would not heal. The public invented their own stories, including a tale that the sound of digging had been heard near the House of Commons and rumours of a French invasion on the [[Isle of Purbeck]]. The evidence of Oates and Bedloe was supplemented by other informers; some like [[Thomas Dangerfield]], were notorious criminals, but others like [[Stephen Dugdale]], Robert Jenison and [[Edward Turberville]] were men of good social standing who from motives of greed or revenge denounced innocent victims, and by their apparently plausible evidence made the Plot seem more credible. Dugdale in particular made such a good initial impression that even the King for the first time \"began to think that there might be somewhat in the Plot\".{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=158}}\n\n===Waning of the hysteria===\nHowever, public opinion began to turn against Oates. As Kenyon points out, the steady protestations of innocence by all of those who were executed eventually took hold in the public mind. Further, outside London the priests who died were almost all venerable and popular members of the community, and there was widespread public horror at their executions. Even Lord Shaftesbury came to regret the mass executions, and is said to have quietly ordered the release of certain priests whose families he knew. Attempts to extend the plot into [[Yorkshire]], (the \"Barnbow Plot\"), where prominent local Catholics like [[Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 2nd Baronet]], were accused of signing \"the Bloody Oath of Secrecy\" ended in failure as their Protestant neighbours who sat on the juries refused to convict them. The judges gradually began to take a more impartial line, ruling that it was not treason for a Catholic to advocate the conversion of England to the old faith, nor to give financial support to religious houses (although the latter was a criminal offence). The Plot gained some credence in [[Ireland]], where the two Catholic Archbishops, [[Oliver Plunkett|Plunkett]] and [[Peter Talbot (bishop)|Talbot]] were the principal victims, but not in [[Scotland]].\n\nHaving had at least twenty-two innocent men executed (the last being [[Oliver Plunkett]], the Catholic [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Armagh]] on 1 July 1681), the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice]], [[William Scroggs]] began to declare people innocent and the King began to devise countermeasures. The King, who was notably tolerant of religious differences and generally inclined to clemency, was embittered at the number of innocent men he had been forced to condemn; possibly thinking of the [[Act of Indemnity and Oblivion]], under which he had pardoned many of his former opponents in 1660, he remarked that his people had never previously had cause to complain of his mercy. At the trial of Sir George Wakeman, and several priests who were tried with him, Scroggs virtually ordered the jury to acquit all of them, and despite public uproar the King made it clear that he approved of Scroggs' conduct. On 31 August 1681, Oates was told to leave his apartments in Whitehall, but remained undeterred and even denounced the King and the Duke of York. He was arrested for [[sedition]], sentenced to a fine of \u00a3100,000 and thrown into prison.\n\nWhen James II acceded to the throne in 1685 he had Oates tried on two charges of perjury. The Bench which tried him was presided over by the formidable [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys]], who conducted the trial in such a manner that Oates had no hope of acquittal, and the jury brought in the expected guilty verdict. The death penalty was not available for perjury and Oates was sentenced to be stripped of clerical dress, whipped through London twice, and imprisoned for life and pilloried every year (the penalties were so severe that it has been argued that Jeffreys was trying to kill Oates by ill-treatment). Oates spent the next three years in prison. At the accession of [[William III of England|William of Orange]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] in 1689, he was pardoned and granted a pension of \u00a3260 a year, but his reputation did not recover. The pension was suspended, but in 1698 was restored and increased to \u00a3300 a year. Oates died on 12 or 13 July 1705, quite forgotten by the public which had once called him a hero.\n\nOf the other informers, James II was content merely to fine Miles Prance for his perjury, on the grounds that he was a Catholic and had been coerced by threats of torture into informing. Thomas Dangerfield was subjected to the same savage penalties as Oates; on returning from his first session in the [[pillory]], Dangerfield died of an eye injury after a scuffle with the barrister Robert Francis., who was hanged for his murder. Bedloe, Turbervile and Dugdale had all died of natural causes while the Plot was still officially regarded as true.\n\n==Long-term effects==\nThe [[Society of Jesus]] suffered the most between 1678 and 1681. During this period, nine Jesuits were executed and twelve died in prison. Three other deaths were attributable to the hysteria.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=205}} They also lost [[Combe, Herefordshire|Combe]] in [[Herefordshire]], which was the Jesuit headquarters for South Wales. A quote from French Jesuit [[Claude de la Colombi\u00e8re]] highlights the plight of the Jesuits during this time period. He comments, \"The name of the Jesuit is hated above all else, even by priests both secular and regular, and by the Catholic laity as well, because it is said that the Jesuits have caused this raging storm, which is likely to overthrow the whole Catholic religion.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=206}}\n\nOther Catholic [[religious orders]] such as the [[Carmelites]], [[Franciscans]], and the [[Benedictines]] were also affected by the hysteria. They were no longer permitted to have more than a certain number of members or missions within England. John Kenyon points out that European religious orders throughout [[Continental Europe|the Continent]] were affected since many of them depended on the alms of the English Catholic community for their existence. Many Catholic [[Presbyters|priests]] were arrested and tried because the Privy Council wanted to make sure to catch all of those who might possess information about the supposed plot.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=209\u201311}}\n\nThe hysteria had serious consequences for ordinary British Catholics as well as priests. On October 30, 1678, a proclamation was made that required all Catholics who were not tradesmen or property owners to leave London and Westminster. They were not to enter a twelve-mile (c.19&nbsp;km) radius of the city without special permission. Throughout this period Catholics were subject to fines, harassment and imprisonment.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=219}} It was not until the early 19th century that most of the anti-Catholic legislation was removed by the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Roman Catholic Relief Act]] of 1829; anti-Catholic sentiment remained even longer among politicians and the general populace, although the [[Gordon Riots]] of 1780 made it clear to sensible observers that Catholics were far more likely to be the victims of violence than its perpetrators.\n\n==Gallery of playing cards==\n<gallery>\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard1.jpg|[[informant|informer]] [[William Bedloe]]\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard2.jpg|[[Titus Oates]] uncovers the supposed plot\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard3.jpg|Magistrate [[Edmund Berry Godfrey]] with Oates\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard4.jpg|[[William Brooks (Alderman of Dublin)|William Brooks]], [[Alderman]] of [[Dublin]]\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard5.jpg|[[Blessed Thomas Pickering|Thomas Pickering]], [[Benedictine monk]]\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard6.jpg|[[Nathaniel Reading]] in [[Pillory]]\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard7.jpg|[[Edward Colman]]\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard8.jpg|The execution of the five [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[A Ballad upon the Popish Plot]]\n* [[Anti-Catholicism]]\n* [[A True Narrative of the Horrid Hellish Popish-Plot]]\n* [[Crypto-papism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |editor= [[Douglas G.

Eventually Oates's intricate web of accusations fell apart, leading to his arrest and conviction for [[perjury]].\n\n== Background ==\n===Development of English anti-Catholicism===\nThe fictitious Popish Plot must be understood against the background of the [[English Reformation]] and the subsequent development of a strong [[anti-catholicism|anti-Catholic]] sentiment among the mostly [[Protestant]] population of England.\n\nThe [[English Reformation]] began in 1533, when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] (1509\u20131547) sought an annulment of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] to marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. As the [[Pope]] would not grant this, Henry broke away from Rome and took control of the [[Church in England]]. Later, he had the monasteries dissolved, causing opposition in the still largely [[Catholicism|Catholic]] nation. Under Henry's son [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] (1547\u20131553), the Church of England was transformed into a strictly Protestant body, with many remnants of Catholicism suppressed. Edward was succeeded by his half-sister [[Mary I of England]] (1553\u20131558), daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine. She was a Catholic and returned the Church in England to union with the [[Holy See]]. Mary tainted her policy by two unpopular actions: she married her cousin, [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II of Spain]], where the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] continued, and had 300 Protestants burned at the stake, causing many Englishmen to associate Catholicism with the involvement of foreign powers and religious persecution.\n\nMary was succeeded by her Protestant half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (1558\u20131603), who again broke away from Rome and suppressed Catholicism. Elizabeth and later Protestant monarchs hanged and mutilated hundreds of Catholic priests and laymen. This, and her dubious legitimacy \u2013 she was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn \u2013 led to Catholic powers not recognising her as queen and favouring her next relative, the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Elizabeth's reign saw Catholic rebellions like the [[Rising of the North]] (1569) as well as plots like the [[Roberto di Ridolfi|Ridolfi Plot]] (1571) or the [[Babington Plot]] (1586), both intending to kill Elizabeth and replace her with Mary with the help of a Spanish invasion. Three popes' interventions, in [[ Regnans in Excelsis |a papal bull]] with its subsequent suspension and reimposition, gave grounds to suspect English Catholics' loyalty. Following the Babington Plot Mary was beheaded in 1587. This \u2013 and Elizabeth's support of the [[Dutch Revolt]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] \u2013 triggered Philip II of Spain's attempted invasion with the [[Spanish Armada]] (1588). This reinforced the impression that Catholicism was a foreign element, while the Armada's failure, largely due to unfavorable weather, convinced many Englishmen that God was supportive of Protestantism.\n\nAnti-Catholic sentiment reached new heights in 1605 after the [[Gunpowder Plot]] was discovered. Catholic plotters attempted to topple the Protestant regime of [[James VI and I|King James I]] by blowing up both King and parliament during the state opening of parliament. However, [[Guy Fawkes]], who was in charge of the explosives, was discovered the night before and the attempt thwarted. The magnitude of the plot \u2013 had it succeeded most leading government figures would have been killed in one stroke \u2013 convinced many Englishmen that Catholics were devious conspirators who would stop at nothing to have their way, thus making allegations about Catholic plots more believable.\n\n===Anti-Catholicism in the 17th century===\nAnti-Catholic sentiment was a constant factor in how England perceived the events of the following decades: the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618\u20131648) was seen as an attempt by the Catholic Habsburgs to exterminate German Protestantism. Under the early Stuart Kings, fears of Catholic conspiracies were rampant and the policies of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] \u2013 especially his church policies, which had a decidedly [[high church]] bent \u2013 were seen as pro-Catholic and likely induced by a Catholic conspiracy headed by Charles' Catholic queen, [[Henrietta Maria of France]]. This, together with accounts of Catholic atrocities in Ireland in 1641, triggered the [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131649), which led to the abolition of the monarchy and a decade of Puritan rule, which espoused religious tolerance for most forms of Protestantism but not for Catholicism. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660 under [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] brought with it a reaction against all religious dissenters, i.e. all outside the [[ State religion #Anglicanism |established]] Church of England. As a result, Catholics felt popular hostility and legal discrimination.\n\nAnti-Catholic hysteria flared up lightly during the reign of Charles II, which saw various disasters such as the [[Great Plague of London]] (1665) and the [[Great Fire of London]] (1666). After the latter, rumors and [[A True Narrative of the Horrid Hellish Popish-Plot|propaganda]] floated around about arson, with Catholics and especially Jesuits as the first to be blamed. Kenyon remarks, \"At Coventry, the townspeople were possessed by the idea that the papists were about to rise and cut their throats ... A nationwide panic seemed likely, and as homeless refugees poured out from London into the countryside, they took with them stories of a kind which were familiar to them in 1678 and 1679.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=10}}\n\nAnti-Catholicism was fueled by doubts about the religious allegiance of the King, who had married a Catholic princess, [[Catherine of Braganza|Catherine of Portugal]] and formed an alliance with France, then the leading Catholic power in Europe, against the Protestant Netherlands. Furthermore, Charles' brother and heir presumptive, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], had embraced Catholicism, although his brother forbade him to make any public announcement. In 1672, Charles issued the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], in which he suspended all [[English Penal Laws|penal law]]s against Catholics and other religious dissenters.<ref>Fraser, pp. 305\u201308; Hutton, pp. 284\u201385.{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}</ref> This resulted in growing fears by Protestants of increasing Catholic influence in England and led to [[Charles II of England#Conflict with Parliament|conflict with parliament]] during the 1670s. In December 1677 an anonymous pamphlet (possibly by [[Andrew Marvell]]) spread alarm in London by suggesting that the Pope planned to change the lawful government of England.{{sfn|Heald|1992|p=603}}\n\n==Events==\n===Beginnings===\nThe fictitious Popish Plot unfolded in a very peculiar fashion. Oates and [[Israel Tonge]], a fanatically anti-Catholic clergyman (who was widely believed to be insane), had written a large manuscript that accused the [[Catholic Church]] authorities of approving the assassination of Charles II. The [[Jesuit]]s in England were to carry out the task. The manuscript also named nearly 100 Jesuits and their supporters who were supposedly involved in this assassination plot; nothing in the document was ever proven to be true.\n\nOates slipped a copy of the manuscript into the [[wainscot]] of a gallery in the house of the [[physician]] Sir Richard Barker, with whom Tonge was living.{{sfn|Pollock|2005|p=13}} The following day Tonge claimed to find the manuscript, and showed it to an acquaintance, Christopher Kirkby, who was shocked and decided to inform the King. Kirkby was a [[chemist]] and a former assistant in Charles' scientific experiments, and Charles prided himself on being approachable to the general public.<ref name=Tonge>{{cite book |author= Alan Marshall |chapter= Tonge, Israel (1621\u20131680) |title= [[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2004}}</ref> On 13 August 1678, whilst Charles was out walking in [[St. James's Park]], the chemist informed him of the plot.<ref>{{cite book |author= Molly Brown |title= The Invitation to a Funeral |publisher= Saint Martin's Press |year= 1999 |isbn= 9780312970949}}</ref> Charles was dismissive but Kirkby stated that he knew the names of assassins who planned to shoot the King and, if that failed, the Queen's physician, [[Sir George Wakeman]], would poison him. When the King demanded proof, the chemist offered to bring Tonge who knew of these matters personally. The King did agree to see both Kirkby and Tonge that evening, when he gave them a short audience. At this stage he was already sceptical, but he was apparently not ready to rule out the possibility that there might be a plot of some sort (otherwise, Kenyon argues, he would not have given these two very obscure men a private audience). Charles told Kirkby to present Tonge to [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Thomas Osborne, Lord Danby]], [[Lord High Treasurer]], then the most influential of the King's ministers.<ref name=Danby>{{cite book |author= Mark Knights |chapter= Osborne, Thomas, first duke of Leeds (1632\u20131712) |title= [[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2004}}</ref> Tonge then lied to Danby, saying that he had found the manuscript but did not know the author.\n\n===Investigations===\nAs Kenyon points out, the government took seriously even the remotest hint of a threat to the King's life or well-being \u2013 in the previous spring a Newcastle housewife had been investigated by the Secretary of State simply for saying that \"the King gets the curse of many good and faithful wives such as myself for his bad example\".{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=61}} Danby, who seems to have believed in the Plot, advised the King to order an investigation. Charles II denied the request, maintaining that the entire affair was absurd. He told Danby to keep the events secret so as not to put the idea of [[regicide]] into people's minds.{{sfn|Pollock|2005|p=73\u201374}} However, word of the manuscript spread to the Duke of York, who publicly called for an investigation into the matter.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|pp=68\u201369}} Even Charles admitted that given the sheer number of allegations, he could not be certain that none of them was true, and reluctantly agreed. During the investigation, Oates' name arose. From the first the King was convinced that Oates was a liar, and Oates did not help his case by claiming to have met the regent of [[Spain]], [[John of Austria the Younger|Don John of Austria]]. Questioned by the King, who had met Don John in [[Brussels]] in 1656, it became obvious that Oates had no idea what he looked like.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=80}} The King had a long and frank talk with [[Paul Barillon]], the French ambassador, in which he made it clear that he did not believe that there was a word of truth in the plot, and that Oates was \"a wicked man\"; but that by now he had come round to the view that there must be an investigation, particularly with Parliament about to reassemble.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=84}}\n\nOn 6 September Oates was summoned before the magistrate [[Edmund Berry Godfrey|Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey]] to swear an oath prior to his testimony before the King. Oates claimed he had been at a [[Jesuit]] meeting held at the White Horse Tavern in the [[Strand, London]] on April 24, 1678.<ref name=\"Williams\">{{cite journal |author= Sheila Williams |title= The Pope-Burning Processions of 1679, 1680 and 1681 |journal= Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |year= 1958 |pages= 104\u201318 }}</ref> According to Oates, the purpose of that meeting was to discuss the assassination of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. The meeting discussed a variety of methods which included: stabbing by Irish ruffians, shooting by two Jesuit soldiers, or poisoning by the Queen's physician, [[George Wakeman|Sir George Wakeman]].<ref name=\"Williams\"/>\n\nOates and Tonge were brought before the [[Privy Council]] later that month, and the Council interrogated Oates for several hours; Tonge, who was generally believed to be mad, was simply laughed at, but Oates made a much better impression on the Council. On 28 September Oates made 43 allegations against various members of Catholic [[religious order]]s \u2013 including 541 Jesuits \u2013 and numerous Catholic nobles. He accused [[Sir George Wakeman]] and [[Edward Colman]], the secretary to [[Mary of Modena]] [[Duchess of York]], of planning the assassination. Colman was found to have corresponded with the French [[Jesuit]] Fr Ferrier, confessor to [[Louis XIV]], outlining his grandiose schemes for obtaining a dissolution of the present Parliament, in the hope of its replacement by a new and pro-French Parliament; in the wake of this revelation he was condemned to death for [[treason]]. Wakeman was later acquitted. Despite Oates' unsavoury reputation, the councillors were impressed by his confidence, his grasp of detail and his remarkable memory. A turning point came when he was shown five letters, supposedly written by well-known priests and giving details of the plot, which he was suspected of forging: Oates \"at a single glance\" named each of the alleged authors. At this the Council were \"amazed\" and began to give much greater credence to the plot; apparently it did not occur to them that Oates' ability to recognise the letters made it ''more'' likely, rather than less, that he had forged them.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=79}}\n\nOthers Oates accused included Dr. [[William Fogarty]], [[Archbishop Peter Talbot]] of [[Dublin]], [[Samuel Pepys]] and [[John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse]]. The list grew to 81 accusations. Oates was given a squad of soldiers and he began to round up Jesuits.\n\n===Godfrey's murder===\nThe allegations gained little credence until the murder of [[Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey]], a member of Parliament and strong supporter of Protestantism, to whom Oates had made his first depositions. His disappearance on 12 October 1678, the finding of his mutilated body on 17 October, and the subsequent failure to solve his murder sent the Protestant population into an uproar. He had been strangled and run through with his own sword. Many of his supporters blamed the murder on Catholics. As Kenyon commented, \"Next day, the 18th, James wrote to William of Orange that Godfrey's death was already 'laid against the Catholics', and even he, never the most realistic of men, feared that 'all these things happening together will cause a great flame in the Parliament.'\"{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=78}} The Lords asked King Charles to banish all Catholics from a radius of 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) around London, which Charles granted on October 30, 1678, but it was too late because London was already in a panic, which was long remembered as \"Godfrey's autumn\".\n\nOates seized on Godfrey's murder as proof that the plot was true. The murder of Godfrey and the discovery of Edward Coleman's letters<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5871?docPos=2 |title= Article 5871 |work= [[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref> provided a solid basis of facts for the lies of Oates and the other informers who followed him. Oates was called to testify before the House of Lords and the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] on October 23, 1678. He testified that he had seen a number of contracts signed by the Superior General of the Jesuits. The contracts appointed officers that would command an army of Catholic supporters to kill Charles II and establish a Catholic monarch.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|pp=78\u201381}} To this day, no one is certain who killed Sir Edmund Godfrey, and most historians regard the mystery as insoluble. Oates' associate [[William Bedloe]] denounced the silversmith [[Miles Prance]], who in turn named three working men, Berry, Green and Hill, who were tried, convicted and executed in February 1679; but it rapidly became clear that they were completely innocent, and that Prance, who had been subjected to [[torture]], named them simply to gain his freedom (Kenyon suggests that he may have chosen men against whom he had a personal grudge, or he may simply have chosen them because they were the first Catholics acquaintances of his who came to mind).\n\n===The Plot before Parliament===\nKing Charles, aware of the unrest, returned to London and summoned [[List of Parliaments of England#Parliaments of Charles II|Parliament]]. He remained unconvinced by Oates' accusations, but Parliament and public opinion forced him to order an investigation. Parliament truly believed that this plot was real, declaring, \"This House is of opinion that there hath been and still is a damnable and hellish plot contrived and carried out by the popish recusants for assigning and murdering the King.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|pp=84\u201385}} Tonge was called to testify on October 25, 1678 where he gave evidence on the Great Fire and, later, rumours of another similar plot. On November 1, both Houses ordered an investigation in which a Frenchman, Choqueux, was discovered to be storing [[gunpowder]] in a house nearby. This caused a panic, until it was discovered that he was simply the King's [[firework]] maker.\n\n===Trial of the Five Catholic Lords===\nOates became more daring and accused five Catholic lords ([[William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis]], [[William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford]], [[Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour]], [[William Petre, 4th Baron Petre]] and [[John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse]]) of involvement in the plot. The King dismissed the accusations as absurd, pointing out that Belasyse was so afflicted with [[gout]] that he could hardly stand, while Arundell and Stafford, who had not been on speaking terms for 25 years, were most unlikely to be intriguing together; but [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]] had the lords arrested and sent to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] on 25 October 1678. Seizing upon the anti-Catholic tide, Shaftesbury publicly demanded that the King's brother, James, be excluded from the [[royal succession]], prompting the [[Exclusion crisis]]. On 5 November 1678, people burned effigies of the [[Pope]] instead of those of [[Guy Fawkes]].<ref name=\"Williams\"/> At the end of the year, the parliament passed a bill, a second [[Test Act]], excluding Catholics from membership of both Houses (a law not repealed until 1829).\n\nOn 1 November 1678, the House of Commons resolved to proceed by impeachment against \"the five popish lords\". On 23 November all Arundell's papers were seized and examined by the Lords' committee; on 3 December the five peers were arraigned for [[high treason]]; and on 5 December the Commons announced the impeachment of Arundell. A month later Parliament was dissolved, and the proceedings were interrupted. In March 1679, it was resolved by both houses that the dissolution had not invalidated the motions for the impeachment. On 10 April 1679 Arundell and three of his companions (Belasyse was too ill to attend) were brought to the House of Lords to put in pleas against the articles of impeachment. Arundell complained of the uncertainty of the charges, and implored the peers to have them \"reduced to competent certainty\". But on 24 April this plea was voted irregular, and on 26 April the prisoners were again brought to the House of Lords and ordered to amend their pleas. Arundell replied by briefly declaring himself not guilty.\n\nThe trial was fixed for 13 May, but a quarrel between the two houses as to points of procedure, and the legality of admitting the bishops as judges in a capital trial, followed by a dissolution, delayed its commencement until 30 November 1680. On that day it was decided to proceed first against Lord Stafford, who was condemned to death on 7 December and beheaded on 29 December.<ref>{{cite book |author= Peter Holmes |chapter= Howard, William, Viscount Stafford (1612\u20131680) |title= [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2004}}</ref> His trial, compared to the other Plot trials, was reasonably fair, but as in all cases of alleged treason at that date the absence of defence counsel was a fatal handicap, and while Oates' credit had been seriously damaged, the evidence of the principal prosecution witnesses, Turberville and Dugdale, struck even fair minded observers like [[John Evelyn]] as being credible enough. Stafford, denied counsel, failed to exploit several inconsistencies in Tuberville's testimony, which a good lawyer might have turned to his client's advantage.\n\nOn 30 December, the evidence against Arundell and his three fellow-prisoners was ordered to be in readiness, but their public proceedings stopped. In fact the death of William Bedloe left the prosecution in serious difficulties, since one protection for a person accused of treason, that there must be two eyewitnesses to an overt act of treason, was observed scrupulously, and only Oates claimed to have any hard evidence against the remaining Lords. Lord Petre died in the Tower in 1683. His companions remained there until 12 February 1684 when an appeal to the [[Court of King's Bench]] to release them on bail was successful. On 21 May 1685 Arundell, Powis, and Belasyse came to the House of Lords to present petitions for the annulling of the charges and on the following day the petitions were granted. On 1 June 1685 their liberty was formally assured on the ground that the witnesses against them had perjured themselves, and on 4 June the [[bill of attainder]] against Stafford was reversed.<ref>{{DNB|wstitle=Arundell, Henry (DNB00)|prescript=}}</ref>\n\n===Height of the hysteria===\n[[File:Houghton EB65 A100 680s4 - Popish Plot, solemn mock procession, 1679.jpg|thumb|Broadside, \"The Solemn Mock Procession of the POPE, Cardinalls, Iesuits, Fryers etc: through y<sup>e</sup> City of London, November y<sup>e</sup> 17th. 1679.\"]]\nOn 24 November 1678, Oates claimed the Queen was working with the King's physician to poison him and enlisted the aid of \"Captain\" [[William Bedloe]], a notorious member of the London underworld. The King personally interrogated Oates, caught him out in a number of inaccuracies and lies, and ordered his arrest. However, a few days later, with the threat of constitutional crisis, Parliament forced the release of Oates.\n\nHysteria continued: [[Roger North (lawyer)|Roger North]] wrote that it was as though \"the very Cabinet of Hell has been opened\". Noblewomen carried firearms if they had to venture outdoors at night. Houses were searched for hidden guns, mostly without any significant result. Some Catholic widows tried to ensure their safety by marrying [[Anglican]] widowers. The House of Commons was searched \u2013 without result \u2013 in the expectation of a second [[Gunpowder Plot]].\n\nAnyone even suspected of being Catholic was driven out of London and forbidden to be within ten miles (16&nbsp;km) of the city. [[William Staley]], a young Catholic banker, made a drunken threat against the King and within 10 days was tried, convicted and executed for plotting to kill him. Oates, for his part, received a state apartment in [[Whitehall]] and an annual allowance. He soon presented new allegations, claiming assassins intended to shoot the King with silver bullets so the wound would not heal. The public invented their own stories, including a tale that the sound of digging had been heard near the House of Commons and rumours of a French invasion on the [[Isle of Purbeck]]. The evidence of Oates and Bedloe was supplemented by other informers; some like [[Thomas Dangerfield]], were notorious criminals, but others like [[Stephen Dugdale]], Robert Jenison and [[Edward Turberville]] were men of good social standing who from motives of greed or revenge denounced innocent victims, and by their apparently plausible evidence made the Plot seem more credible. Dugdale in particular made such a good initial impression that even the King for the first time \"began to think that there might be somewhat in the Plot\".{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=158}}\n\n===Waning of the hysteria===\nHowever, public opinion began to turn against Oates. As Kenyon points out, the steady protestations of innocence by all of those who were executed eventually took hold in the public mind. Further, outside London the priests who died were almost all venerable and popular members of the community, and there was widespread public horror at their executions. Even Lord Shaftesbury came to regret the mass executions, and is said to have quietly ordered the release of certain priests whose families he knew. Attempts to extend the plot into [[Yorkshire]], (the \"Barnbow Plot\"), where prominent local Catholics like [[Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 2nd Baronet]], were accused of signing \"the Bloody Oath of Secrecy\" ended in failure as their Protestant neighbours who sat on the juries refused to convict them. The judges gradually began to take a more impartial line, ruling that it was not treason for a Catholic to advocate the conversion of England to the old faith, nor to give financial support to religious houses (although the latter was a criminal offence). The Plot gained some credence in [[Ireland]], where the two Catholic Archbishops, [[Oliver Plunkett|Plunkett]] and [[Peter Talbot (bishop)|Talbot]] were the principal victims, but not in [[Scotland]].\n\nHaving had at least twenty-two innocent men executed (the last being [[Oliver Plunkett]], the Catholic [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Armagh]] on 1 July 1681), the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice]], [[William Scroggs]] began to declare people innocent and the King began to devise countermeasures. The King, who was notably tolerant of religious differences and generally inclined to clemency, was embittered at the number of innocent men he had been forced to condemn; possibly thinking of the [[Act of Indemnity and Oblivion]], under which he had pardoned many of his former opponents in 1660, he remarked that his people had never previously had cause to complain of his mercy. At the trial of Sir George Wakeman, and several priests who were tried with him, Scroggs virtually ordered the jury to acquit all of them, and despite public uproar the King made it clear that he approved of Scroggs' conduct. On 31 August 1681, Oates was told to leave his apartments in Whitehall, but remained undeterred and even denounced the King and the Duke of York. He was arrested for [[sedition]], sentenced to a fine of \u00a3100,000 and thrown into prison.\n\nWhen James II acceded to the throne in 1685 he had Oates tried on two charges of perjury. The Bench which tried him was presided over by the formidable [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys]], who conducted the trial in such a manner that Oates had no hope of acquittal, and the jury brought in the expected guilty verdict. The death penalty was not available for perjury and Oates was sentenced to be stripped of clerical dress, whipped through London twice, and imprisoned for life and pilloried every year (the penalties were so severe that it has been argued that Jeffreys was trying to kill Oates by ill-treatment). Oates spent the next three years in prison. At the accession of [[William III of England|William of Orange]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] in 1689, he was pardoned and granted a pension of \u00a3260 a year, but his reputation did not recover. The pension was suspended, but in 1698 was restored and increased to \u00a3300 a year. Oates died on 12 or 13 July 1705, quite forgotten by the public which had once called him a hero.\n\nOf the other informers, James II was content merely to fine Miles Prance for his perjury, on the grounds that he was a Catholic and had been coerced by threats of torture into informing. Thomas Dangerfield was subjected to the same savage penalties as Oates; on returning from his first session in the [[pillory]], Dangerfield died of an eye injury after a scuffle with the barrister Robert Francis., who was hanged for his murder. Bedloe, Turbervile and Dugdale had all died of natural causes while the Plot was still officially regarded as true.\n\n==Long-term effects==\nThe [[Society of Jesus]] suffered the most between 1678 and 1681. During this period, nine Jesuits were executed and twelve died in prison. Three other deaths were attributable to the hysteria.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=205}} They also lost [[Combe, Herefordshire|Combe]] in [[Herefordshire]], which was the Jesuit headquarters for South Wales. A quote from French Jesuit [[Claude de la Colombi\u00e8re]] highlights the plight of the Jesuits during this time period. He comments, \"The name of the Jesuit is hated above all else, even by priests both secular and regular, and by the Catholic laity as well, because it is said that the Jesuits have caused this raging storm, which is likely to overthrow the whole Catholic religion.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=206}}\n\nOther Catholic [[religious orders]] such as the [[Carmelites]], [[Franciscans]], and the [[Benedictines]] were also affected by the hysteria. They were no longer permitted to have more than a certain number of members or missions within England. John Kenyon points out that European religious orders throughout [[Continental Europe|the Continent]] were affected since many of them depended on the alms of the English Catholic community for their existence. Many Catholic [[Presbyters|priests]] were arrested and tried because the Privy Council wanted to make sure to catch all of those who might possess information about the supposed plot.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=209\u201311}}\n\nThe hysteria had serious consequences for ordinary British Catholics as well as priests. On October 30, 1678, a proclamation was made that required all Catholics who were not tradesmen or property owners to leave London and Westminster. They were not to enter a twelve-mile (c.19&nbsp;km) radius of the city without special permission. Throughout this period Catholics were subject to fines, harassment and imprisonment.{{sfn|Kenyon|1985|p=219}} It was not until the early 19th century that most of the anti-Catholic legislation was removed by the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Roman Catholic Relief Act]] of 1829; anti-Catholic sentiment remained even longer among politicians and the general populace, although the [[Gordon Riots]] of 1780 made it clear to sensible observers that Catholics were far more likely to be the victims of violence than its perpetrators.\n\n==Gallery of playing cards==\n<gallery>\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard1.jpg|[[informant|informer]] [[William Bedloe]]\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard2.jpg|[[Titus Oates]] uncovers the supposed plot\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard3.jpg|Magistrate [[Edmund Berry Godfrey]] with Oates\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard4.jpg|[[William Brooks (Alderman of Dublin)|William Brooks]], [[Alderman]] of [[Dublin]]\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard5.jpg|[[Blessed Thomas Pickering|Thomas Pickering]], [[Benedictine monk]]\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard6.jpg|[[Nathaniel Reading]] in [[Pillory]]\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard7.jpg|[[Edward Colman]]\nImage:Popish Plot Playcard8.jpg|The execution of the five [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[A Ballad upon the Popish Plot]]\n* [[Anti-Catholicism]]\n* [[A True Narrative of the Horrid Hellish Popish-Plot]]\n* [[Crypto-papism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |editor= [[Douglas G.

This area extended from the 1939 eastern border of Germany proper and of [[East Prussia]] up to the [[Bug River]] where the German armies had halted their advance and linked up with the Soviet [[Red Army]] in accordance with their secret pact against Poland.\n\nThe [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] signed on 23 August 1939 had promised the vast territory between the Vistula and Bug rivers to the Soviet \"sphere of influence\" in divided Poland, while the two powers would have jointly ruled Warsaw. To settle the deviation from the original agreement, the German and Soviet representatives met again on September 28 to delineate a permanent border between the two countries. Under [[German\u2013Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation|this revised version]] of the pact the territory concerned was exchanged for the inclusion in the Soviet sphere of [[Lithuania]], which had originally fallen within the ambit of Germany. With the new agreement the entire central part of Poland, including the core ethnic area of the Poles, came under exclusively German control.\n\n[[File:Mapa 2 paktu Ribbentrop-Mo\u0142otow.gif|thumb|German-Soviet border drawn-out in the aftermath of the [[Invasion of Poland|Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland]], signed in Moscow by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] during the Second [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]] known as the [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty|Frontier Treaty]] of September 28, 1939]]\n\nHitler decreed the direct annexation to the [[German Reich]] of [[Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany|large parts]] of the occupied Polish territory in the western half of the German zone, in order to increase the Reich's [[Lebensraum]].<ref>''\"Erla\u00df des F\u00fchrers und Reichskanzlers \u00fcber die Gliederung und Verwaltung der Ostgebiete\"''</ref> Germany organized most of these areas as two new [[Reichsgau]]e: [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia|Danzig-West Prussia]] and [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Wartheland]]. The remaining three regions, the so-called areas of Zichenau, Eastern [[Upper Silesia]] and the [[Suwa\u0142ki]] triangle, became attached to adjacent [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaue]] of Germany. Draconian measures were introduced by both RKF and HTO,{{Ref|a-RKF|[a]}} to facilitate the immediate [[Germanization]] of the annexed territory, typically resulting in [[Forced resettlement|mass expulsions]], especially in the Warthegau. The remaining parts of the former Poland were to become a German ''{{lang|de|Nebenland}}'' ([[March (territory)|March]], borderland) as a frontier post of German rule in the east. A F\u00fchrer's decree of October 12, 1939 established the General Government; the decree came into force on October 26, 1939.<ref name=\"Diemut2003\"/>\n\n[[Hans Frank]] was appointed as the [[Governor-General]] of the General Government. German authorities made a sharp contrast between the new Reich territory and a supposedly occupied [[rump state]] that could serve as a bargaining chip with the Western powers. The Germans established a closed border between the two German zones to heighten the difficulty of cross-frontier communication between the different segments of the Polish population.\n\nThe official name chosen for the new entity was the ''{{lang|de|Generalgouvernement f\u00fcr die besetzten polnischen Gebiete}}'' (General Government for the Occupied Polish Territories), then changed to the ''Generalgouvernement'' (General Government) by Frank's decree of July 31, 1940. However, this name did not imply anything about the actual nature of the administration. The German authorities never regarded these Polish lands (apart from the short period of [[German military administration in occupied Poland|military administration]] during the actual [[invasion of Poland]]) as an [[Military occupation|occupied territory]].<ref name=\"Majer265\">Majer (2003), p. 265.</ref> The Nazis considered the Polish state to have effectively ceased to exist with its defeat in the September campaign.\n\nOverall, 4&nbsp;million of the 1939 population of the General Government area had lost their lives by the time the Soviet armed forces entered the area in late 1944. If the Polish underground killed a German, 50\u2013100 Poles were executed by German police as a punishment and as a warning to other Poles.<ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206246.pdf Generalgouvernement] Shoah Resource Center</ref> Most of the Jews, perhaps as many as two million, had also been rounded up and murdered.  Germans destroyed Warsaw after the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. As the Soviets advanced through Poland in late 1944 the General Government collapsed. American troops captured [[Hans Frank]], who had governed the region, in May 1945; he became one of the defendants at the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. During his trial he resumed his childhood practice of Catholicism and expressed repentance. Frank surrendered forty volumes of his diaries to the Tribunal; much evidence against him and others was gathered from them. He was found guilty of [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]. On October 1, 1946, he was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[hanging]]. The sentence was carried out on October 16.\n\n==German intentions regarding the region==\n{{Further|Generalplan Ost|Lebensraum|Wehrbauer}}\n\nThe destruction of Warsaw and construction of a new German town was [[Pabst Plan|planned]] before the war and during the occupation. Later the plans were included into the Generalplan Ost. \nIn March 1941 Hans Frank informed his subordinates that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had made the decision to \"turn this region into a purely German area within 15\u201320 years\". He explained: \"Where 12&nbsp;million [[Poles]] now live, is to be populated by 4 to 5&nbsp;million [[Germans]].

Most of the Polish population was expelled by the Nazi occupation authorities with documented brutality. Himmler intended the city of [[Lublin]] to have a German population of 20% to 25% by the beginning of 1944, and of 30% to 40% by the following year, at which time Lublin was to be declared a German city and given a German mayor.<ref>Rich, Norman (1974).

Germany had [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|already annexed]] large parts of western pre-war Poland (8 October 1939) before the establishment of the General Government (26 October 1939), and the remaining region was also intended{{by whom|date=November 2015}} to be directly incorporated into the German Reich at some future date. The Nazi leadership discussed numerous initiatives with this aim.\n\nThe earliest such proposal (October/November 1939) called for the establishment of a separate ''Reichsgau [[Beskids|Beskidenland]]'' which would encompass several southern sections of the Polish territories conquered in 1939 (around 18,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), stretching from the area to the west of [[Krak\u00f3w]] to the [[San (river)|San river]] in the east.<ref>Burleigh, Michael (1988).

For the entire period of the General Government's existence there was only one General-Governor: Dr. Hans Frank. The [[NSDAP]] structure in General Gouvernment was ''Arbeitsbereich Generalgouvernement'' led by Frank.\n\nThe Office was headed by Chief of the Government ({{lang-de|Regierung|translation=government}}), also known as the State Secretary ({{lang-de|Staatssekret\u00e4r}}) (or Deputy Governor) [[Josef B\u00fchler]]. Several other individuals had powers to issue legislative decrees in addition to the General Governor, most notably the Higher [[SS and Police Leader]] of General Government ([[Friedrich-Wilhelm Kr\u00fcger]]; from October 1943: [[Wilhelm Koppe]]).\n\n[[File:Announcement of death of 100 of Polish hostages shot by Nazi-German authority in Poland 1941.jpg|thumb|upright|Announcement of the execution of 60 Polish hostages and a list of 40 new hostages taken by Nazi authorities in Poland, 1943]]\n\n[[File:General Government issued ID card for an administration worker.jpg|thumb|ID card for an administration worker \u2013 issued by the General Government]]\n\n{{quote|No government protectorate is anticipated for Poland, but a complete German administration.

According to the Nazi government the Polish state had effectively ceased to exist, in spite of the existence of a [[Polish government-in-exile]].<ref name=\"Majer2\"/> The General Government had the character of a type of [[colony|colonial state]]. It was not a Polish [[puppet government]], as there were no Polish representatives above the local administration.\n\nThe government seat of the General Government was located in Krak\u00f3w (German: ''{{lang|de|Krakau}}''; {{lang-en|Cracow}}) rather than in [[Warsaw]] for security reasons. The official state language was German, although Polish continued in use by local government. Useful institutions of the old Polish state were retained for ease of administration. The Polish police, with no high-ranking Polish officers (they were arrested or demoted), was reorganised as the [[Blue Police]] and became subordinated to the [[Ordnungspolizei]]. The Polish educational system was similarly retained, but most higher institutions were closed. The Polish local administration was kept, subordinated to new German bosses. The Polish fiscal system, including the [[z\u0142oty]] currency, remained in use but with revenues going to the German state. A new bank was created; it issued new banknotes.\n\nThe Germans sought to play [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]] and Poles off against each other. Within ethnic Ukrainian areas annexed by Germany, beginning in October 1939, Ukrainian Committees were established{{by whom|date=April 2019}} with the purpose of representing the Ukrainian community to the German authorities and assisting the approximately 30,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled from Soviet-controlled territories. These committees also undertook cultural and economic activities that had been banned by the previous Polish government. Schools, choirs, reading societies and theaters were opened, and twenty Ukrainian churches that had been closed by the Polish government reopened. A Ukrainian publishing house was set up in Cracow, which \u2013 despite having to struggle with German censors and paper shortages \u2013 succeeded in publishing school textbooks, classics of [[Ukrainian literature]], and the works of dissident Ukrainian writers from the Soviet Union. By March 1941, there were 808 Ukrainian educational societies with 46,000 members. Ukrainian organizations within the General Government were able to negotiate the release of 85,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war from the German-Polish conflict (although they were unable to help Soviet POWs of Ukrainian ethnicity).<ref>Myroslav Yurkevich.

At that time, the Polish court system was reinstated and made decisions in cases not concerning German interests, for which a parallel German court-system was established. The German system was given priority in cases of overlapping jurisdiction.\n\nNew laws were passed, discriminating against ethnic Poles and, in particular, the Jews. In 1941 a new [[criminal law]] was introduced, introducing many new crimes, and making the [[death penalty]] very common. The death penalty was introduced for, among other things:\n* on October 31, 1939, for any acts against the German government\n* on January 21, 1940, for economic speculation\n* on February 20, 1940, for spreading [[sexually-transmitted disease]]s\n* on July 31, 1940, for any Polish officers who did not register immediately with the German administration (to be taken to [[prisoner of war]] camps)\n* on November 10, 1941, for giving any assistance to Jews\n* on July 11, 1942, for farmers who failed to provide requested contingents of crops\n* on July 24, 1943, for not joining the forced labor battalions ([[Baudienst]]) when requested\n* on October 2, 1943, for impeding the [[German Reconstruction Plan]]\n\n===Policing===\nThe police in the General Government was divided into:\n\n* [[Ordnungspolizei]] (OrPo) (native German)\n* the [[Blue Police]] (Polish under German control)\n* [[Sicherheitspolizei]] (native German) composed of:\n** [[Kriminalpolizei]] (German)\n** [[Gestapo]] (German)\n\nThe most numerous [[Ordnungspolizei#Police Battalions|OrPo battalions]] focused on traditional security roles as an occupying force.

These were the ''Distrikt [[Warsaw|Warschau]]'', the ''Distrikt [[Lublin]]'', the ''Distrikt [[Radom]]'', and the ''Distrikt [[Krak\u00f3w|Krakau]]''. After the [[Operation Barbarossa]] against the Soviets in June 1941, East [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (part of Poland, annected by [[Ukrainian SSR]] on the basis of the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]]), was incorporated into the General Government and became its fifth district: [[District of Galicia|''Distrikt Galizien'']]. The new German administrative units were much larger than those organized by the Polish government, reflecting the German lack of sufficient administrative personnel to staff smaller units.<ref>Rich (1974), p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe five districts were further sub-divided into urban counties (''Stadtkreise'') and rural counties (''Kreishauptmannschaften''). Following a decree on September 15, 1941, the names of most of the major cities (and their respective counties) were renamed based on historical German data or given germanified versions of their Polish and Soviet names if none existed. At times the previous names remained the same as well (i.e. Radom).

Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Rzeszowskiego. 2003. p.68.</ref> About 860,000 Poles and Jews were resettled into the General Government after they have been expelled from the territories 'annexed' by Nazi Germany. Offsetting this was the German genocidal campaign of liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia and other elements considered likely to resist. From 1941 disease and hunger also began to reduce the population.\n\nPoles were also deported in large numbers to work as forced labor in Germany: eventually about a million were deported, of whom many died in Germany. In 1940 the population was segregated into different groups. Each group had different rights, food rations, allowed strips in the cities, public transportation and restricted restaurants.

If the prices were set too high in cities there was a concern that workers would not be able to afford the food and protest the prices. Due to the price inflation which was occurring in the Generalgouvernement, many places relied on the [[Barter|barter system]] (exchanging goods for other goods instead of money). \"Introducing rationing in September 1940, [[Marshal Petain]] insisted that \u2018everyone must assume their share of common hardship.\u2019\"<ref name=\":1\" /> There was clearly food instability not only in the ghettos, but also in cities, which caused everyone to be conscious about food rationing, and caused conditions for Jewish people to worsen. While workers in Norway and France protested the new rationing of food, Germany and the UK, where the citizens supported war efforts were more supportive of the rationing therefore it was more effective. Cases, where a country was being occupied, caused the citizens to be more hesitant about the rationing of food and it was overall not as effective.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe|last=Mazower|first=Mark|publisher=The Penguin Press|year=2008|isbn=9780713996814|location=London, UK|pages=277\u2013279}}</ref> In December, 1941 it was recognized by the Generalgouvernement that starving the Jewish people to death was an inexpensive and expedient solution.

This rationale was utilized by the [[German Supreme Court]] to reassign the identity of all Polish nationals as [[statelessness|stateless subjects]], with the exception of the [[German diaspora|ethnic Germans]] of interwar Poland\u2014who, disregarding international law, were named the only rightful citizens of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Diemut2003\">{{cite book |title=\"Non-Germans\" Under the Third Reich: The Nazi Judicial and Administrative System in Germany and Occupied Eastern Europe with Special Regard to Occupied Poland, 1939\u20131945 |publisher=JHU Press |work=With contribution from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |year=2003 |author=Diemut Majer |pages=236\u2013246 |isbn=0801864933 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_BCNrHG9K8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22Point%20of%20Departure%3A%20Statelessness%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe General Government was run by Germany as a separate administrative unit for logistical purposes.

This area extended from the 1939 eastern border of Germany proper and of [[East Prussia]] up to the [[Bug River]] where the German armies had halted their advance and linked up with the Soviet [[Red Army]] in accordance with their secret pact against Poland.\n\nThe [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] signed on 23 August 1939 had promised the vast territory between the Vistula and Bug rivers to the Soviet \"sphere of influence\" in divided Poland, while the two powers would have jointly ruled Warsaw. To settle the deviation from the original agreement, the German and Soviet representatives met again on September 28 to delineate a permanent border between the two countries. Under [[German\u2013Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation|this revised version]] of the pact the territory concerned was exchanged for the inclusion in the Soviet sphere of [[Lithuania]], which had originally fallen within the ambit of Germany. With the new agreement the entire central part of Poland, including the core ethnic area of the Poles, came under exclusively German control.\n\n[[File:Mapa 2 paktu Ribbentrop-Mo\u0142otow.gif|thumb|German-Soviet border drawn-out in the aftermath of the [[Invasion of Poland|Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland]], signed in Moscow by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] during the Second [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]] known as the [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty|Frontier Treaty]] of September 28, 1939]]\n\nHitler decreed the direct annexation to the [[German Reich]] of [[Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany|large parts]] of the occupied Polish territory in the western half of the German zone, in order to increase the Reich's [[Lebensraum]].<ref>''\"Erla\u00df des F\u00fchrers und Reichskanzlers \u00fcber die Gliederung und Verwaltung der Ostgebiete\"''</ref> Germany organized most of these areas as two new [[Reichsgau]]e: [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia|Danzig-West Prussia]] and [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Wartheland]]. The remaining three regions, the so-called areas of Zichenau, Eastern [[Upper Silesia]] and the [[Suwa\u0142ki]] triangle, became attached to adjacent [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaue]] of Germany. Draconian measures were introduced by both RKF and HTO,{{Ref|a-RKF|[a]}} to facilitate the immediate [[Germanization]] of the annexed territory, typically resulting in [[Forced resettlement|mass expulsions]], especially in the Warthegau. The remaining parts of the former Poland were to become a German ''{{lang|de|Nebenland}}'' ([[March (territory)|March]], borderland) as a frontier post of German rule in the east. A F\u00fchrer's decree of October 12, 1939 established the General Government; the decree came into force on October 26, 1939.<ref name=\"Diemut2003\"/>\n\n[[Hans Frank]] was appointed as the [[Governor-General]] of the General Government. German authorities made a sharp contrast between the new Reich territory and a supposedly occupied [[rump state]] that could serve as a bargaining chip with the Western powers. The Germans established a closed border between the two German zones to heighten the difficulty of cross-frontier communication between the different segments of the Polish population.\n\nThe official name chosen for the new entity was the ''{{lang|de|Generalgouvernement f\u00fcr die besetzten polnischen Gebiete}}'' (General Government for the Occupied Polish Territories), then changed to the ''Generalgouvernement'' (General Government) by Frank's decree of July 31, 1940. However, this name did not imply anything about the actual nature of the administration. The German authorities never regarded these Polish lands (apart from the short period of [[German military administration in occupied Poland|military administration]] during the actual [[invasion of Poland]]) as an [[Military occupation|occupied territory]].<ref name=\"Majer265\">Majer (2003), p. 265.</ref> The Nazis considered the Polish state to have effectively ceased to exist with its defeat in the September campaign.\n\nOverall, 4&nbsp;million of the 1939 population of the General Government area had lost their lives by the time the Soviet armed forces entered the area in late 1944. If the Polish underground killed a German, 50\u2013100 Poles were executed by German police as a punishment and as a warning to other Poles.<ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206246.pdf Generalgouvernement] Shoah Resource Center</ref> Most of the Jews, perhaps as many as two million, had also been rounded up and murdered.  Germans destroyed Warsaw after the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. As the Soviets advanced through Poland in late 1944 the General Government collapsed. American troops captured [[Hans Frank]], who had governed the region, in May 1945; he became one of the defendants at the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. During his trial he resumed his childhood practice of Catholicism and expressed repentance. Frank surrendered forty volumes of his diaries to the Tribunal; much evidence against him and others was gathered from them. He was found guilty of [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]. On October 1, 1946, he was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[hanging]]. The sentence was carried out on October 16.\n\n==German intentions regarding the region==\n{{Further|Generalplan Ost|Lebensraum|Wehrbauer}}\n\nThe destruction of Warsaw and construction of a new German town was [[Pabst Plan|planned]] before the war and during the occupation.

Germany had [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|already annexed]] large parts of western pre-war Poland (8 October 1939) before the establishment of the General Government (26 October 1939), and the remaining region was also intended{{by whom|date=November 2015}} to be directly incorporated into the German Reich at some future date. The Nazi leadership discussed numerous initiatives with this aim.\n\nThe earliest such proposal (October/November 1939) called for the establishment of a separate ''Reichsgau [[Beskids|Beskidenland]]'' which would encompass several southern sections of the Polish territories conquered in 1939 (around 18,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), stretching from the area to the west of [[Krak\u00f3w]] to the [[San (river)|San river]] in the east.<ref>Burleigh, Michael (1988).

For the entire period of the General Government's existence there was only one General-Governor: Dr. Hans Frank. The [[NSDAP]] structure in General Gouvernment was ''Arbeitsbereich Generalgouvernement'' led by Frank.\n\nThe Office was headed by Chief of the Government ({{lang-de|Regierung|translation=government}}), also known as the State Secretary ({{lang-de|Staatssekret\u00e4r}}) (or Deputy Governor) [[Josef B\u00fchler]].

It was not a Polish [[puppet government]], as there were no Polish representatives above the local administration.\n\nThe government seat of the General Government was located in Krak\u00f3w (German: ''{{lang|de|Krakau}}''; {{lang-en|Cracow}}) rather than in [[Warsaw]] for security reasons. The official state language was German, although Polish continued in use by local government. Useful institutions of the old Polish state were retained for ease of administration. The Polish police, with no high-ranking Polish officers (they were arrested or demoted), was reorganised as the [[Blue Police]] and became subordinated to the [[Ordnungspolizei]]. The Polish educational system was similarly retained, but most higher institutions were closed. The Polish local administration was kept, subordinated to new German bosses. The Polish fiscal system, including the [[z\u0142oty]] currency, remained in use but with revenues going to the German state. A new bank was created; it issued new banknotes.\n\nThe Germans sought to play [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]] and Poles off against each other. Within ethnic Ukrainian areas annexed by Germany, beginning in October 1939, Ukrainian Committees were established{{by whom|date=April 2019}} with the purpose of representing the Ukrainian community to the German authorities and assisting the approximately 30,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled from Soviet-controlled territories. These committees also undertook cultural and economic activities that had been banned by the previous Polish government. Schools, choirs, reading societies and theaters were opened, and twenty Ukrainian churches that had been closed by the Polish government reopened. A Ukrainian publishing house was set up in Cracow, which \u2013 despite having to struggle with German censors and paper shortages \u2013 succeeded in publishing school textbooks, classics of [[Ukrainian literature]], and the works of dissident Ukrainian writers from the Soviet Union. By March 1941, there were 808 Ukrainian educational societies with 46,000 members. Ukrainian organizations within the General Government were able to negotiate the release of 85,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war from the German-Polish conflict (although they were unable to help Soviet POWs of Ukrainian ethnicity).<ref>Myroslav Yurkevich.

The German system was given priority in cases of overlapping jurisdiction.\n\nNew laws were passed, discriminating against ethnic Poles and, in particular, the Jews. In 1941 a new [[criminal law]] was introduced, introducing many new crimes, and making the [[death penalty]] very common.

These were the ''Distrikt [[Warsaw|Warschau]]'', the ''Distrikt [[Lublin]]'', the ''Distrikt [[Radom]]'', and the ''Distrikt [[Krak\u00f3w|Krakau]]''. After the [[Operation Barbarossa]] against the Soviets in June 1941, East [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (part of Poland, annected by [[Ukrainian SSR]] on the basis of the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]]), was incorporated into the General Government and became its fifth district: [[District of Galicia|''Distrikt Galizien'']]. The new German administrative units were much larger than those organized by the Polish government, reflecting the German lack of sufficient administrative personnel to staff smaller units.<ref>Rich (1974), p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe five districts were further sub-divided into urban counties (''Stadtkreise'') and rural counties (''Kreishauptmannschaften''). Following a decree on September 15, 1941, the names of most of the major cities (and their respective counties) were renamed based on historical German data or given germanified versions of their Polish and Soviet names if none existed. At times the previous names remained the same as well (i.e. Radom).

Offsetting this was the German genocidal campaign of liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia and other elements considered likely to resist. From 1941 disease and hunger also began to reduce the population.\n\nPoles were also deported in large numbers to work as forced labor in Germany: eventually about a million were deported, of whom many died in Germany. In 1940 the population was segregated into different groups. Each group had different rights, food rations, allowed strips in the cities, public transportation and restricted restaurants.

If the prices were set too high in cities there was a concern that workers would not be able to afford the food and protest the prices. Due to the price inflation which was occurring in the Generalgouvernement, many places relied on the [[Barter|barter system]] (exchanging goods for other goods instead of money). \"Introducing rationing in September 1940, [[Marshal Petain]] insisted that \u2018everyone must assume their share of common hardship.\u2019\"<ref name=\":1\" /> There was clearly food instability not only in the ghettos, but also in cities, which caused everyone to be conscious about food rationing, and caused conditions for Jewish people to worsen. While workers in Norway and France protested the new rationing of food, Germany and the UK, where the citizens supported war efforts were more supportive of the rationing therefore it was more effective. Cases, where a country was being occupied, caused the citizens to be more hesitant about the rationing of food and it was overall not as effective.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe|last=Mazower|first=Mark|publisher=The Penguin Press|year=2008|isbn=9780713996814|location=London, UK|pages=277\u2013279}}</ref> In December, 1941 it was recognized by the Generalgouvernement that starving the Jewish people to death was an inexpensive and expedient solution.

The Germans began the [[Holocaust|elimination of the Jewish population]] under the guise of \"resettlement\" in spring of 1942. The three Reinhard camps including [[Treblinka]] (the deadliest of them all) had transferable SS staff and almost identical design. The General Government was the location of four of the seven [[extermination camp]]s of World War II in which the most extreme measures of [[the Holocaust]] were carried out, including closely located [[Majdanek concentration camp]], [[Sobibor extermination camp]] and [[Belzec extermination camp]].  The [[genocide]] of undesired \"[[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]\", chiefly millions of Jews from Poland and other countries, was carried out by gassing between 1942 and 1944.<ref name=\"Arad\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/belzecsobibortre00yitz | url-access=registration | quote=Belzec. |ref=harv |title=Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps |first=Yitzhak |last=Arad |authorlink=Yitzhak Arad |publisher=Indiana University Press | orig-year=1987 |year=1999 |isbn=0253213053 |id= {{ASIN|0253213053|country=uk}} |via=Internet Archive |page=[https://archive.org/details/belzecsobibortre00yitz/page/37 37]}}</ref>\n\n== Punishments ==\n*Hans Frank instituted a reign of terror against the civilian population<ref>{{cite web|title=Holocaust Encyclopedia: Hans Frank|website=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007108|accessdate=18 April 2016}}</ref> and became directly involved in the mass murder of Jews.
