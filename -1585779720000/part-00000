The population was 12,232 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the principal city of the Bogalusa Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Washington Parish and is also part of the larger [[New Orleans]]&ndash;[[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]]&ndash;Bogalusa [[Combined Statistical Area]].\n\nThe name of the city derives from the [[Choctaw language]] term ''bogue lusa'', which translates into [[English language|English]] as \"dark water<ref>{{cite book|last=Leeper|first=Clare D'Artois|title=Louisiana Place Names: Popular, Unusual, and Forgotten Stories of Towns, Cities, Plantations, Bayous, and Even Some Cemeteries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHeeUa0xNxcC&pg=PA42|date=19 October 2012|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=978-0-8071-4740-5|page=42}}</ref> or \"smoky water\".<ref>Rony, Vera. \"Bogalusa: The Economics of Tragedy\". ''Dissent'' May\u2013June 1966. p 235.</ref> Located in an area of pine forests, in the early 20th century, this industrial city was developed as a company town, to provide worker housing and services in association with a [[Great Southern Lumber Company]] sawmill. In the late 1930s, this operation was replaced with paper mills and chemical operations.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bogalusa 1911 Map.jpg|170px|left|thumbnail|1911 Bogalusa maps]]\n\n===The timber industry===\nIn the early 1900s, brothers Frank Henry Goodyear and [[Charles W. Goodyear]] of [[Buffalo, New York]], bought hundreds of thousands of acres of virgin pine forests in southeastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi. They had already been successful in lumbering isolated areas in New York and Pennsylvania, and had developed a strategy of building railroad spurs to provide access to the forests. In 1902, they chartered the [[Great Southern Lumber Company]] (1908\u201338) and built its sawmill in what became Bogalusa, a company town which they built to support this rural operation. The sawmill was the largest in the world at the time.<ref name=LSU>[http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/g3225.html LSU Libraries\u2014Great Southern Lumber Company Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715192354/http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/g3225.html |date=2014-07-15 }} Retrieved 2013-12-28</ref> The Goodyear interests built the city of Bogalusa to house workers and supervisors, and associated infrastructure. They also built the [[Great Northern New Orleans Railroad]] to New Orleans to transport their lumber and products to market.\n\nThe city, designed by architect [[Rathbone DeBuys]] of New Orleans and built from the ground up in less than a year, had several hotels, a [[YMCA]] and [[YWCA]], churches of all faiths, and houses for the workers and supervisors. It was called the \"Magic City\" due to its rapid construction. The manager of Great Southern Lumber Company was [[William H. Sullivan (town boss)|William H. Sullivan]]. As sawmill manager, he acted as town boss when the city was built. After Bogalusa was incorporated as a city on July 4, 1914, Sullivan was elected as mayor by white voters (blacks had been disenfranchised), and repeatedly re-elected, serving until his death on June 26, 1929.\n\n[[File:National Atlas Louisiana closeup ESE.gif|left|thumb|Bogalusa (''top'') in regional map, northeast of [[Baton Rouge]] and [[Hammond, LA|Hammond]], north of [[New Orleans]]]]\n\nThe Great Southern Lumber Company's sprawling sawmill produced up to 1,000,000 board feet (2400&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of lumber each day. With the virgin pine forest cleared, the sawmill closed in 1938 during the [[Great Depression]]. It was replaced as the city's main industry by the Bogalusa Paper Company (a subsidiary of Great Southern), that merged with Gaylord Container Corporation in 1937 and a chemical plant run by Gaylord.  [[Crown-Zellerbach]] acquired Gaylord's operations in 1955. An attempt to keep the sawmill open with California redwood proved too costly, and the mill was closed. A paper mill and chemical operations continued. At its peak in 1960, the city had more than 21,000 residents. In 1985 Crown was split up but the timber industry still continues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crt.state.la.us/Assets/OCD/hp/nationalregister/historic_contexts/The_Louisiana_Lumber_Boom_c1880-1925.pdf|last=Fricker|first=Donna |accessdate=2019-05-09|title=The Louisiana Lumber Boom, c.1880-1925|publisher=Fricker Historic Preservation Services LLC|date=2007-10-25|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\n===Racial conflict===\nIn 1919 there was labour strife at the town's [[Great Southern Lumber Company]], the largest sawmill in the world. Company owners supported a white militia group and brought in Black strikebreakers that increased racial tension. Events culminated in the [[Bogalusa sawmill killings]] which saw four union men killed. On August 31, 1919, Black veteran [[African American veterans lynched after WWI|Lucius McCarty]] was accused of assaulting a white woman and a mob of some 1,500 people seized McCarty and shot him more than 1,000 times. The mob then dragged his corpse behind a car through the black neighborhoods before burning his body in a bonfire. {{sfn|Equal Justice Initiative|2019|p=}} {{sfn|Whitaker|2009|p=54}}\n\n===Civil rights era===\nBoth black and white industrial workers had come to the company town for work since the early 20th century. After World War II and service for their country, African-American veterans struggled in Louisiana and the South against the oppression of [[Jim Crow]] laws, state segregation, and [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] and exclusion from the political system, all continuing since the turn of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the civil rights era, black workers pressed [[Crown Zellerbach]] to open all positions to them, promote them to supervisory positions, and otherwise give them equal opportunities at work. White workers resisted these changes. Similarly, blacks pressured Bogalusa to integrate public facilities, especially after passage of the Civil Rights Law of 1964.\n\nIn Bogalusa, black workers also struggled against the industrial class system. As their activism increased in the [[civil rights era]], whites resisted. Local [[Ku Klux Klan]] members dominated the region, attacking and intimidating civil rights activists in the 1960s. In 1964, as civil rights activists continued to push for their constitutional rights after congressional passage that year of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] that year, whites increased their resistance.\n\nDetermined to fight for their rights, [[Bob Hicks (activist)|Bob Hicks]], [[Charles Sims (activist)|Charles Sims]],  [[A.Z. Young]], and others had taken leadership of the (all-black) [[Bogalusa Civic and Voters\u2019 League]]. On February 21, 1965, with the help of three activists from the [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]] based in [[Jonesboro, Louisiana]], they founded the first affiliated chapter of that African-American self-defense organization. Other leaders of the Deacons were Bert Wyre, Aurilus \u201cReeves\u201d Perkins, Sam Bonds, Fletcher Anderson, and others.<ref name=\"foundation\"/> They mobilized many war veterans within the black community to provide armed security to civil rights activists and their families.<ref name=\"hague\">{{cite web|url=http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1997-8/Hague.html |last=Hague|first=Seth Hague|title= 'Niggers Ain't Gonna Run This Town': Militancy, Conflict and the Sustenance of the Hegemony in Bogalusa, Louisiana, (Outstanding History Paper)|date=1997-1998|publisher= Loyola University-New Orleans|access-date= 11 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gimletmedia.com/episode/the-deacons/|title=\u00bb The Deacons|website=Gimlet Media|access-date=2016-11-24}}</ref> Expecting a violent summer, the State Police established an office in Bogalusa in February 1965.<ref name=\"hague\"/>\n\nAs explained by Seth Hague, \n<blockquote>...the community came to embrace the militant rhetoric of the Jonesboro Deacons. Many violent conflicts ensued under this ideology and culminated in a climactic summer in 1965. Consequently, the black workers\u2019 militancy threatened not only the power of the middle class blacks, but also the political and economic hegemony of the white power structure in Bogalusa. Except for a few noteworthy courtroom \"victories\" versus Crown-Zellerbach, threatening the power structure was virtually the struggle's only effect as the white power structure subsumed the militancy and rhetoric of the revolutionary Bogalusans.\"<ref name=\"hague\"/></blockquote>\n\nTwo unsolved murders of African Americans took place in Bogalusa during the civil rights era: killed in 1965 was [[Oneal Moore]], the first black deputy sheriff hired for the Washington Parish Sheriff's Office, and in 1966 [[Clarence Triggs]] was killed.\n\n===Since 1970===\nWith changes in the lumber industry, through the late 20th century, after 1960, a steady decline in industrial operations, jobs, and associated population of the town occurred. By 2015, the population was estimated at slightly less than 12,000,<ref name=\"USCensusEst2015\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015|accessdate=July 2, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160602200744/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015.html|archive-date=2016-06-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> more than 40% below the high in 1960. These conditions have made it more difficult for remaining residents.\n\nIn 1995, a railroad [[tank car]] imploded at [[Gaylord Chemical Corporation]], releasing [[nitrogen tetroxide]] and forcing the evacuation of about 3,000 people within a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) radius. Residents say \"the sky turned orange\" as a result. Emergency rooms filled with about 4,000 people who complained of burning eyes, skin, and lungs. Dozens of [[lawsuit]]s were filed against Gaylord Chemical and were finally settled in May 2005, with compensation checks issued to around 20,000 people affected by the accident.\n\nOn August 29, 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit the city with winds of about {{convert|110|mi/h|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}}, downing numerous trees and power lines. Many buildings in Bogalusa were damaged from falling trees, and several were destroyed. Most of the houses, businesses, and other buildings suffered roof damage from the storm's ferocious winds. Some outlying areas of the city were without power for more than a month.\n\n==Commemoration==\n*The [[Robert \"Bob\" Hicks House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]  in 2015.\n*The Robert Hicks Foundation was established to carry on the work for civil rights.

The [[Race (United States Census)|racial makeup]] of the city was 57.18% White, 41.21% African American, 0.32% Native American, 0.39% Asian, 0.16% from other races, and 0.73% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 0.75% of the population.\n\nOf the 5,431 households, 29.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 36.1% were married couples living together, 23.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.6% were not families. About 32.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 3.05.\n\nIn the city, the population was distributed as  27.4% under the age of 18, 9.2% from 18 to 24, 23.9% from 25 to 44, 21.3% from 45 to 64, and 18.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 82.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 76.0 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $19,261, and  for a family was $24,947. Males had a median income of $26,716 versus $17,992 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $11,476. About 26.1% of families and 32.9% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 45.1% of those under age 18 and 22.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Economy==\nBogalusa was founded by the [[Charles W. Goodyear|Goodyears]] of [[Buffalo, New York]], who chartered the [[Great Southern Lumber Company]] in 1902.<ref name=LSU/> The sawmill was, for many years, the largest in the world. The company was famous for its reforestation program.\n[[File:Bogalusa Texaco ad.png|thumb|Ad in ''Southern Engineer,'' Volume 27, 1917, promoting Bogalusa]]\nIn 1938, the Goodyear family's mill had clear cut all the virgin longleaf yellow pine within hundreds of miles of Bogalusa and, after an unprofitable effort to import redwood from California ended their sawmill operations at the Great Southern Lumber Company; the next phase was run by Gaylord. This was bought by [[Georgia-Pacific|Crown Zellerbach]], which in turn was acquired by Georgia Pacific in 1986. Its brown paper successor [[Gaylord Container Corporation]] owned it until 2002, when Gaylord was acquired by [[Temple-Inland]] Corporation, the area's largest employer.  As of 2012, the paper mill was owned by [[International Paper]], which acquired Temple-Inland.\n\nBogalusa's economy revolves around the lumber and paper mills, as well as agriculture.\n\n==Government==\nBogalusa is home to the 205th Engineer Battalion of the Louisiana [[Army National Guard]].  This unit is part of the [[225th Engineer Brigade]], which is headquartered in [[Pineville, Louisiana]], at [[Camp Beauregard]].\n\n==Crime==\nWith a crime rate of 60 per one thousand residents, Bogalusa has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes- from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. One's chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in 17. Within Louisiana, more than 92% of the communities have a lower crime rate than Bogalusa.<ref>https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/la/bogalusa/crime</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nBogalusa operates its own public school system, [[Bogalusa City Schools]].\n\nNorthshore Technical Community College is located in Bogalusa.

The population was 12,232 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is the principal city of the Bogalusa Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Washington Parish and is also part of the larger [[New Orleans]]&ndash;[[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]]&ndash;Bogalusa [[Combined Statistical Area]].\n\nThe name of the city derives from the [[Choctaw language]] term ''bogue lusa'', which translates into [[English language|English]] as \"dark water<ref>{{cite book|last=Leeper|first=Clare D'Artois|title=Louisiana Place Names: Popular, Unusual, and Forgotten Stories of Towns, Cities, Plantations, Bayous, and Even Some Cemeteries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHeeUa0xNxcC&pg=PA42|date=19 October 2012|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=978-0-8071-4740-5|page=42}}</ref> or \"smoky water\".<ref>Rony, Vera. \"Bogalusa: The Economics of Tragedy\". ''Dissent'' May\u2013June 1966. p 235.</ref> Located in an area of pine forests, in the early 20th century, this industrial city was developed as a company town, to provide worker housing and services in association with a [[Great Southern Lumber Company]] sawmill. In the late 1930s, this operation was replaced with paper mills and chemical operations.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bogalusa 1911 Map.jpg|170px|left|thumbnail|1911 Bogalusa maps]]\n\n===The timber industry===\nIn the early 1900s, brothers Frank Henry Goodyear and [[Charles W. Goodyear]] of [[Buffalo, New York]], bought hundreds of thousands of acres of virgin pine forests in southeastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi. They had already been successful in lumbering isolated areas in New York and Pennsylvania, and had developed a strategy of building railroad spurs to provide access to the forests. In 1902, they chartered the [[Great Southern Lumber Company]] (1908\u201338) and built its sawmill in what became Bogalusa, a company town which they built to support this rural operation. The sawmill was the largest in the world at the time.<ref name=LSU>[http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/g3225.html LSU Libraries\u2014Great Southern Lumber Company Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715192354/http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/findaid/g3225.html |date=2014-07-15 }} Retrieved 2013-12-28</ref> The Goodyear interests built the city of Bogalusa to house workers and supervisors, and associated infrastructure. They also built the [[Great Northern New Orleans Railroad]] to New Orleans to transport their lumber and products to market.\n\nThe city, designed by architect [[Rathbone DeBuys]] of New Orleans and built from the ground up in less than a year, had several hotels, a [[YMCA]] and [[YWCA]], churches of all faiths, and houses for the workers and supervisors. It was called the \"Magic City\" due to its rapid construction. The manager of Great Southern Lumber Company was [[William H. Sullivan (town boss)|William H. Sullivan]]. As sawmill manager, he acted as town boss when the city was built. After Bogalusa was incorporated as a city on July 4, 1914, Sullivan was elected as mayor by white voters (blacks had been disenfranchised), and repeatedly re-elected, serving until his death on June 26, 1929.\n\n[[File:National Atlas Louisiana closeup ESE.gif|left|thumb|Bogalusa (''top'') in regional map, northeast of [[Baton Rouge]] and [[Hammond, LA|Hammond]], north of [[New Orleans]]]]\n\nThe Great Southern Lumber Company's sprawling sawmill produced up to 1,000,000 board feet (2400&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of lumber each day. With the virgin pine forest cleared, the sawmill closed in 1938 during the [[Great Depression]]. It was replaced as the city's main industry by the Bogalusa Paper Company (a subsidiary of Great Southern), that merged with Gaylord Container Corporation in 1937 and a chemical plant run by Gaylord.  [[Crown-Zellerbach]] acquired Gaylord's operations in 1955. An attempt to keep the sawmill open with California redwood proved too costly, and the mill was closed. A paper mill and chemical operations continued. At its peak in 1960, the city had more than 21,000 residents. In 1985 Crown was split up but the timber industry still continues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crt.state.la.us/Assets/OCD/hp/nationalregister/historic_contexts/The_Louisiana_Lumber_Boom_c1880-1925.pdf|last=Fricker|first=Donna |accessdate=2019-05-09|title=The Louisiana Lumber Boom, c.1880-1925|publisher=Fricker Historic Preservation Services LLC|date=2007-10-25|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\n===Racial conflict===\nIn 1919 there was labour strife at the town's [[Great Southern Lumber Company]], the largest sawmill in the world. Company owners supported a white militia group and brought in Black strikebreakers that increased racial tension. Events culminated in the [[Bogalusa sawmill killings]] which saw four union men killed. On August 31, 1919, Black veteran [[African American veterans lynched after WWI|Lucius McCarty]] was accused of assaulting a white woman and a mob of some 1,500 people seized McCarty and shot him more than 1,000 times. The mob then dragged his corpse behind a car through the black neighborhoods before burning his body in a bonfire. {{sfn|Equal Justice Initiative|2019|p=}} {{sfn|Whitaker|2009|p=54}}\n\n===Civil rights era===\nBoth black and white industrial workers had come to the company town for work since the early 20th century. After World War II and service for their country, African-American veterans struggled in Louisiana and the South against the oppression of [[Jim Crow]] laws, state segregation, and [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] and exclusion from the political system, all continuing since the turn of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the civil rights era, black workers pressed [[Crown Zellerbach]] to open all positions to them, promote them to supervisory positions, and otherwise give them equal opportunities at work. White workers resisted these changes. Similarly, blacks pressured Bogalusa to integrate public facilities, especially after passage of the Civil Rights Law of 1964.\n\nIn Bogalusa, black workers also struggled against the industrial class system. As their activism increased in the [[civil rights era]], whites resisted. Local [[Ku Klux Klan]] members dominated the region, attacking and intimidating civil rights activists in the 1960s. In 1964, as civil rights activists continued to push for their constitutional rights after congressional passage that year of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] that year, whites increased their resistance.\n\nDetermined to fight for their rights, [[Bob Hicks (activist)|Bob Hicks]], [[Charles Sims (activist)|Charles Sims]],  [[A.Z. Young]], and others had taken leadership of the (all-black) [[Bogalusa Civic and Voters\u2019 League]]. On February 21, 1965, with the help of three activists from the [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]] based in [[Jonesboro, Louisiana]], they founded the first affiliated chapter of that African-American self-defense organization. Other leaders of the Deacons were Bert Wyre, Aurilus \u201cReeves\u201d Perkins, Sam Bonds, Fletcher Anderson, and others.<ref name=\"foundation\"/> They mobilized many war veterans within the black community to provide armed security to civil rights activists and their families.<ref name=\"hague\">{{cite web|url=http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1997-8/Hague.html |last=Hague|first=Seth Hague|title= 'Niggers Ain't Gonna Run This Town': Militancy, Conflict and the Sustenance of the Hegemony in Bogalusa, Louisiana, (Outstanding History Paper)|date=1997-1998|publisher= Loyola University-New Orleans|access-date= 11 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gimletmedia.com/episode/the-deacons/|title=\u00bb The Deacons|website=Gimlet Media|access-date=2016-11-24}}</ref> Expecting a violent summer, the State Police established an office in Bogalusa in February 1965.<ref name=\"hague\"/>\n\nAs explained by Seth Hague, \n<blockquote>...the community came to embrace the militant rhetoric of the Jonesboro Deacons. Many violent conflicts ensued under this ideology and culminated in a climactic summer in 1965. Consequently, the black workers\u2019 militancy threatened not only the power of the middle class blacks, but also the political and economic hegemony of the white power structure in Bogalusa. Except for a few noteworthy courtroom \"victories\" versus Crown-Zellerbach, threatening the power structure was virtually the struggle's only effect as the white power structure subsumed the militancy and rhetoric of the revolutionary Bogalusans.\"<ref name=\"hague\"/></blockquote>\n\nTwo unsolved murders of African Americans took place in Bogalusa during the civil rights era: killed in 1965 was [[Oneal Moore]], the first black deputy sheriff hired for the Washington Parish Sheriff's Office, and in 1966 [[Clarence Triggs]] was killed.\n\n===Since 1970===\nWith changes in the lumber industry, through the late 20th century, after 1960, a steady decline in industrial operations, jobs, and associated population of the town occurred. By 2015, the population was estimated at slightly less than 12,000,<ref name=\"USCensusEst2015\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015|accessdate=July 2, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160602200744/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015.html|archive-date=2016-06-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> more than 40% below the high in 1960. These conditions have made it more difficult for remaining residents.\n\nIn 1995, a railroad [[tank car]] imploded at [[Gaylord Chemical Corporation]], releasing [[nitrogen tetroxide]] and forcing the evacuation of about 3,000 people within a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) radius. Residents say \"the sky turned orange\" as a result. Emergency rooms filled with about 4,000 people who complained of burning eyes, skin, and lungs. Dozens of [[lawsuit]]s were filed against Gaylord Chemical and were finally settled in May 2005, with compensation checks issued to around 20,000 people affected by the accident.\n\nOn August 29, 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit the city with winds of about {{convert|110|mi/h|km/h|round=5|abbr=on}}, downing numerous trees and power lines. Many buildings in Bogalusa were damaged from falling trees, and several were destroyed. Most of the houses, businesses, and other buildings suffered roof damage from the storm's ferocious winds. Some outlying areas of the city were without power for more than a month.\n\n==Commemoration==\n*The [[Robert \"Bob\" Hicks House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]  in 2015.\n*The Robert Hicks Foundation was established to carry on the work for civil rights.

About 26.1% of families and 32.9% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 45.1% of those under age 18 and 22.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Economy==\nBogalusa was founded by the [[Charles W. Goodyear|Goodyears]] of [[Buffalo, New York]], who chartered the [[Great Southern Lumber Company]] in 1902.<ref name=LSU/> The sawmill was, for many years, the largest in the world. The company was famous for its reforestation program.\n[[File:Bogalusa Texaco ad.png|thumb|Ad in ''Southern Engineer,'' Volume 27, 1917, promoting Bogalusa]]\nIn 1938, the Goodyear family's mill had clear cut all the virgin longleaf yellow pine within hundreds of miles of Bogalusa and, after an unprofitable effort to import redwood from California ended their sawmill operations at the Great Southern Lumber Company; the next phase was run by Gaylord.

On October 12, 1548, Diego Ruiz de Vallejo left [[El Tocuyo]], under orders of Juan Villegas, to conquer the Cuicas Province, a name that was given by the natives that inhabited the area and where the Bocon\u00f3 valley was located, with the objective of taking gold from the mines that were supposedly in the area.\n\nIn 1558, an argument between Francisco Ruiz, sent by the governor of the province of Venezuela to occupy the sector of los Cuicas, and Juan de Maldonado, representative of the Real Audiencia del Nuevo Reino de Granada, occurred; Juan de Maldonado alleged that his people controlled those lands. Nevertheless, the capable work of Ruiz guaranteed that those lands were under the jurisdiction of Venezuela.<ref>[http://www.mipunto.com/venezuelavirtual/000/002/028/002/001/000.html VENEZUELA VIRTUAL | Ciudades | Los Andes | Trujillo | Bocon\u00f3 | Historia<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119121857/http://www.mipunto.com/venezuelavirtual/000/002/028/002/001/000.html |date=November 19, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1786, the Bocon\u00f3 Canton was formed.\n\nIn 1811, Bocon\u00f3 was declared a city and joined the independence movement.

On October 12, 1548, Diego Ruiz de Vallejo left [[El Tocuyo]], under orders of Juan Villegas, to conquer the Cuicas Province, a name that was given by the natives that inhabited the area and where the Bocon\u00f3 valley was located, with the objective of taking gold from the mines that were supposedly in the area.\n\nIn 1558, an argument between Francisco Ruiz, sent by the governor of the province of Venezuela to occupy the sector of los Cuicas, and Juan de Maldonado, representative of the Real Audiencia del Nuevo Reino de Granada, occurred; Juan de Maldonado alleged that his people controlled those lands.

[[Suderwick]] is part of Bocholt and is situated at the border annex to [[Dinxperlo]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe northern border of the city of Bocholt is the German border with the [[Netherlands]]. Bocholt borders the [[Wesel (district)|district of Wesel]], in the [[D\u00fcsseldorf (region)|administrative region of D\u00fcsseldorf]], in the southwest.<ref>[http://www.bocholt.de/fileadmin/DAM/Fachbereich_10/Dokumente/Ortsrecht/bocholt_rathaus_ortsrecht_0101.pdf bocholt Rathaus Ortsrecht] bocholt.de</ref>\n\nBocholt is bordered in the north by the Dutch municipalities of [[Aalten]] and [[Winterswijk]], in the east by the city of [[Rhede]], in the south by the city of [[Hamminkeln]], and in the west by the city of [[Isselburg]].\n\nThe climate in the region of Bocholt and West M\u00fcnsterland is temperate with distinct maritime influences, with very mild winters in comparison to other German regions because of the proximity to the ocean and the low [[elevation]]. Summers are moderately warm. The average temperature in January is 2.7&nbsp;\u00b0C and in July 18.4&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nIn the average year there are 12 days of snow cover, about 31 sunny days (high temperature of 25&nbsp;\u00b0C or higher) and 6 hot days (30&nbsp;\u00b0C or higher) on average. In the average year there is about 750&nbsp;mm of precipitation, with June (78&nbsp;mm) and April (41&nbsp;mm) being the driest months.\n\n==History==\nBocholt was first written about in 779, when [[Charlemagne]] won a battle against the [[Saxony|Saxon]]s nearby. However the settlement was probably much older. Bishop Dietrich III von Isenburg from [[M\u00fcnster]] gave Bocholt [[Town privileges|city rights]] in 1222.\n\nIn the 15th century the city flourished. The engraver [[Israhel van Meckenem]] lived and worked in the city.\n\nBetween 1803 and 1810 Bocholt was the capital of the [[Principality of Salm]]. The Principality of Salm was governed by the prince of [[Salm-Salm]] and the prince of [[Salm-Kyrburg]].\n\n{{anchor|Allied air attack}}During the Second World War the city survived generally unscathed until an Allied bombing raid on 22 March 1945 which destroyed most of the city. The city was then captured by the British a week later on 28 March. The city was the site of the [[List of prisoner-of-war camps in Germany|Stalag VI-F POW camp]].\n\nIn 1975 the former municipalities Barlo, Biemenhorst, Hemden, Holtwick, Liedern, Lowick, Mussum, [[Spork (locality)|Spork]], Stenern and [[Suderwick]] were merged into Bocholt.<ref>[http://www.archive.nrw.de/LAV_NRW/jsp/bestand.jsp?archivNr=208&expandId=61&tektId=22 Amt Liedern-Werth], Archive in Nordrhein-Westfalen</ref>\n\n==Population development==\n\n* 1871=6.125\n* 1880=8.534\n* 1890=13.034\n* 1900=21.278\n* 1910=26.404\n* 1925=30.182\n* 1933=33.441\n* 1939=35.099\n* 1945=29.443\n* 1950=37.674\n* 1961=45.675\n* 1970=48.852\n* 1980=65.352\n* 1987=67.028\n* 2000=72.138\n* 2007=73.560\n* 2010=73.170\n* 2015=71.443\n\n==Economy==\nBocholt is a manufacturing town. It was  centered on the textile industry for most of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today there are still several successful textile manufacturers in town, but the importance of the textile industry has greatly declined. The major employers today in Bocholt are [[Gigaset Communications|Gigaset]] (Communications) and Mechanical Drives (formerly Flender) (Siemens) - a leading manufacturer of transmissions, especially for wind energy plants. Most of Bocholt's industries are smaller and manufacture highly specialized products. Some of them are international leaders in their particular fields - A Good example is the bicycle company [[ROSE Bikes]]. Local industries profit from cooperation with the University of Applied Sciences (Fachhochschule) also located in Bocholt as well as with similar institutions in the region.\n\nBocholt is also a regional centre for shopping in the West-M\u00fcnsterland area and draws consumers from the neighbouring rural and small town areas of the Netherlands. The town features an attractive old town shopping area as well as a popular new shopping mall.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe coat of arms shows a [[beech]] tree, which has been the symbol for the city since the 13th century. Bocholt translated into [[English language|English]] roughly means \"beechwood\".

In the summer, foreign motorists need to take care because of the popularity of cycling in the city, and even in winter, many people travel only by bike. Group cycling tours, called \"P\u00e4ttkestouren\", are particularly popular in the spring. Between 2005 and 2006 the city of Bocholt won the ADFC and BUND title of \"most bicycle-friendly city in Germany\" in the category of cities under 100,000 inhabitants. Bocholt is the first city in Germany to have a guarded bike station at a Bustreff and not at a railway station. A second bike station in Bocholt went into operation in 2008.\n\n==Transport==\nBocholt is the last stop on a 25-minute 2-way-1-track train route starting in Wesel traveling north to Bocholt. From Wesel one can transfer to trains that travel south to [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]], D\u00fcsseldorf Hauptbahnhof or northwest to [[Emmerich am Rhein]] or Arnhem in the Netherlands.

It is situated 4&nbsp;km south of the border with the [[Netherlands]]. [[Suderwick]] is part of Bocholt and is situated at the border annex to [[Dinxperlo]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe northern border of the city of Bocholt is the German border with the [[Netherlands]]. Bocholt borders the [[Wesel (district)|district of Wesel]], in the [[D\u00fcsseldorf (region)|administrative region of D\u00fcsseldorf]], in the southwest.<ref>[http://www.bocholt.de/fileadmin/DAM/Fachbereich_10/Dokumente/Ortsrecht/bocholt_rathaus_ortsrecht_0101.pdf bocholt Rathaus Ortsrecht] bocholt.de</ref>\n\nBocholt is bordered in the north by the Dutch municipalities of [[Aalten]] and [[Winterswijk]], in the east by the city of [[Rhede]], in the south by the city of [[Hamminkeln]], and in the west by the city of [[Isselburg]].\n\nThe climate in the region of Bocholt and West M\u00fcnsterland is temperate with distinct maritime influences, with very mild winters in comparison to other German regions because of the proximity to the ocean and the low [[elevation]]. Summers are moderately warm. The average temperature in January is 2.7&nbsp;\u00b0C and in July 18.4&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nIn the average year there are 12 days of snow cover, about 31 sunny days (high temperature of 25&nbsp;\u00b0C or higher) and 6 hot days (30&nbsp;\u00b0C or higher) on average. In the average year there is about 750&nbsp;mm of precipitation, with June (78&nbsp;mm) and April (41&nbsp;mm) being the driest months.\n\n==History==\nBocholt was first written about in 779, when [[Charlemagne]] won a battle against the [[Saxony|Saxon]]s nearby. However the settlement was probably much older. Bishop Dietrich III von Isenburg from [[M\u00fcnster]] gave Bocholt [[Town privileges|city rights]] in 1222.\n\nIn the 15th century the city flourished. The engraver [[Israhel van Meckenem]] lived and worked in the city.\n\nBetween 1803 and 1810 Bocholt was the capital of the [[Principality of Salm]]. The Principality of Salm was governed by the prince of [[Salm-Salm]] and the prince of [[Salm-Kyrburg]].\n\n{{anchor|Allied air attack}}During the Second World War the city survived generally unscathed until an Allied bombing raid on 22 March 1945 which destroyed most of the city. The city was then captured by the British a week later on 28 March. The city was the site of the [[List of prisoner-of-war camps in Germany|Stalag VI-F POW camp]].\n\nIn 1975 the former municipalities Barlo, Biemenhorst, Hemden, Holtwick, Liedern, Lowick, Mussum, [[Spork (locality)|Spork]], Stenern and [[Suderwick]] were merged into Bocholt.<ref>[http://www.archive.nrw.de/LAV_NRW/jsp/bestand.jsp?archivNr=208&expandId=61&tektId=22 Amt Liedern-Werth], Archive in Nordrhein-Westfalen</ref>\n\n==Population development==\n\n* 1871=6.125\n* 1880=8.534\n* 1890=13.034\n* 1900=21.278\n* 1910=26.404\n* 1925=30.182\n* 1933=33.441\n* 1939=35.099\n* 1945=29.443\n* 1950=37.674\n* 1961=45.675\n* 1970=48.852\n* 1980=65.352\n* 1987=67.028\n* 2000=72.138\n* 2007=73.560\n* 2010=73.170\n* 2015=71.443\n\n==Economy==\nBocholt is a manufacturing town. It was  centered on the textile industry for most of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today there are still several successful textile manufacturers in town, but the importance of the textile industry has greatly declined. The major employers today in Bocholt are [[Gigaset Communications|Gigaset]] (Communications) and Mechanical Drives (formerly Flender) (Siemens) - a leading manufacturer of transmissions, especially for wind energy plants. Most of Bocholt's industries are smaller and manufacture highly specialized products. Some of them are international leaders in their particular fields - A Good example is the bicycle company [[ROSE Bikes]]. Local industries profit from cooperation with the University of Applied Sciences (Fachhochschule) also located in Bocholt as well as with similar institutions in the region.\n\nBocholt is also a regional centre for shopping in the West-M\u00fcnsterland area and draws consumers from the neighbouring rural and small town areas of the Netherlands. The town features an attractive old town shopping area as well as a popular new shopping mall.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe coat of arms shows a [[beech]] tree, which has been the symbol for the city since the 13th century. Bocholt translated into [[English language|English]] roughly means \"beechwood\". [http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Bocholt]\n\n==Cyclists Bocholt==\nBocholt is a designated bicycle city, and almost every citizen has one or more bikes, the bicycle network is vast and convenient. In the summer, foreign motorists need to take care because of the popularity of cycling in the city, and even in winter, many people travel only by bike. Group cycling tours, called \"P\u00e4ttkestouren\", are particularly popular in the spring. Between 2005 and 2006 the city of Bocholt won the ADFC and BUND title of \"most bicycle-friendly city in Germany\" in the category of cities under 100,000 inhabitants. Bocholt is the first city in Germany to have a guarded bike station at a Bustreff and not at a railway station. A second bike station in Bocholt went into operation in 2008.\n\n==Transport==\nBocholt is the last stop on a 25-minute 2-way-1-track train route starting in Wesel traveling north to Bocholt. From Wesel one can transfer to trains that travel south to [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]], D\u00fcsseldorf Hauptbahnhof or northwest to [[Emmerich am Rhein]] or Arnhem in the Netherlands.

Both sides had to deal with resource supply and personnel issues over the course of the siege. British resupply and reinforcement activities were limited to sea access. After eleven months of the siege, the British abandoned Boston by sailing to [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe siege began on April 19 after the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], when the militia from surrounding Massachusetts communities blocked land access to Boston. The [[Continental Congress]] formed the [[Continental Army]] from the militia, with [[George Washington]] as its Commander in Chief. In June 1775, the British [[Battle of Bunker Hill|seized Bunker and Breed's Hills]], from which the Continentals were preparing to bombard the city, but their casualties were heavy and their gains were insufficient to break the Continental Army's hold on land access to Boston. The Americans laid siege to the British-occupied city. Military actions during the remainder of the siege were limited to occasional raids, minor skirmishes, and sniper fire.\n\nIn November 1775, George Washington sent the 25-year-old bookseller-turned-soldier [[Henry Knox]] to bring to Boston the heavy artillery that had been [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured at Fort Ticonderoga]]. In a technically complex and demanding operation, Knox [[Noble train of artillery|brought many cannons to the Boston area]] by January 1776. In March 1776, these artillery [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|fortified Dorchester Heights]] (which overlooked Boston and its harbor), thereby threatening the British supply lifeline. The British commander [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] saw the British position as indefensible and withdrew the British forces in Boston to the British stronghold at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], on March 17.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|American Revolution|Boston campaign}}\n\n[[File:Grand Union Flag.svg|left|upright|thumb|The Grand Union flag flown by George Washington during the Siege of Boston<ref>Ryan P. Randolph, ''Betsy Ross: The American Flag, and Life in a Young America'', p. 38</ref>]]\nPrior to 1775, the British [[Colonial history of the United States#Tax protests lead to Revolution|imposed taxes and import duties]] on the American colonies, to which the inhabitants objected since they [[No taxation without representation|lacked British Parliamentary representation]]. In response to the [[Boston Tea Party]] and other acts of protest, 4,000 British troops under the command of General [[Thomas Gage]] were sent to occupy Boston and to pacify the restive [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]].<ref name=\"Chidsey5\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 5</ref> Parliament authorized Gage, [[Intolerable Acts|among other actions]], to disband the local provincial government (led by [[John Hancock]] and [[Samuel Adams]]). It was reformed into the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress|Provincial Congress]], and continued to meet. The Provincial Congress called for the organization of local militias and coordinated the accumulation of weapons and other military supplies.<ref name=\"FrothinghamProvCong\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 35, 54</ref> Under the terms of the [[Boston Port Act]], Gage closed the Boston port, which caused much unemployment and discontent.<ref name=\"Frothingham7\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], p. 7</ref>\n\n[[File:Lexington Concord Siege of Boston.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1775 map of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] and the Siege of Boston]]\nWhen British forces were sent to seize military supplies from the town of [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] on April 19, 1775, militia companies from surrounding towns opposed them at the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]].<ref name=\"McCullough7\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 7</ref> At Concord, some of the British forces were routed in a confrontation at the [[Old North Bridge|North Bridge]].

They particularly blocked the Charlestown Neck (the only land access to Charlestown), and the [[Boston Neck]] (the only land access to Boston, which was then [[Shawmut Peninsula|a peninsula]]), leaving only the harbor and sea access under British control.<ref name=\"Frothingham100\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\nIn the days immediately following the creation of the siege line, the size of the colonial forces grew, as militias from [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] arrived on the scene.<ref name=\"Frothingham100\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 100\u2013101</ref> General Gage wrote of his surprise of the number of rebels surrounding the city: \"The rebels are not the despicable rabble too many have supposed them to be....In all their wars against the French they never showed such conduct, attention, and perseverance as they do now.\"<ref name=\"Harvey1\">[[#Harvey|Harvey]], p. 1</ref>\n\nGeneral Gage turned his attention to fortifying easily defensible positions. In the south, at Roxbury, Gage ordered lines of defenses with 10 twenty-four pound guns. In Boston proper, four hills were quickly fortified. They were to be the main defense of the city.<ref>[[#French|French]], p. 236</ref> Over time, each of these hills was strengthened.<ref>[[#French|French]], p. 237</ref> Gage also decided to abandon Charlestown, removing the beleaguered forces (that had retreated from Concord) to Boston.  The town of Charlestown itself was entirely vacant, and the high lands of Charlestown (Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill) were left undefended, as were the [[Dorchester Heights|heights of Dorchester]], which had a commanding view of the harbor and the city.<ref name=\"FrenchUndefended\">[[#French|French]], pp. 126\u2013128,220</ref>\n\nThe British at first greatly restricted movement in and out of the city, fearing infiltration of weapons.  Besieged and besiegers eventually reached an informal agreement allowing traffic on the Boston Neck, provided no firearms were carried.  Residents of Boston turned in almost 2,000 muskets, and most of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] residents left the city.<ref name=\"Chidsey53\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 53</ref>  Many [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who lived outside the city of Boston left their homes and fled into the city. Most of them felt that it was not safe to live outside of the city, because the Patriots were now in control of the countryside.<ref name=\"French228\">[[#French|French]], p. 228</ref>  Some of the men, after arriving in Boston, joined Loyalist regiments attached to the British army.<ref name=\"French234\">[[#French|French]], p. 234</ref>\n\nBecause the siege did not blockade the harbor, the city remained open for the [[Royal Navy]], under [[Samuel Graves|Vice Admiral Samuel Graves]], to bring in supplies from [[Nova Scotia]] and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the [[Command of the sea|naval supremacy]] of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information about what was happening in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.<ref name=\"McCullough118\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 118</ref>\n\n===Early skirmishes===\nOn May 3, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress authorized [[Benedict Arnold]] to raise forces for taking [[Fort Ticonderoga]] near the southern end of [[Lake Champlain]] in the [[Province of New York]], which was known to have heavy weapons, but to be only lightly defended.  Arnold arrived in [[Castleton, Vermont|Castleton]] (in what is now [[Vermont]], but was then [[New Hampshire Grants|disputed territory]] between New York and New Hampshire) on the 9th, where he joined with [[Ethan Allen]] and a militia company from Connecticut, all of whom had independently arrived at the idea of taking Ticonderoga.  This company, under the joint leadership of Arnold and Allen, [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured Fort Ticonderoga]] and [[Fort Crown Point]].  They also captured the one large military vessel on Lake Champlain in a raid on [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)|Fort Saint-Jean]].<ref name=\"Fisher318\">[[#Fisher|Fisher]], pp. 318\u2013321</ref>  They recovered over 180 cannons, as well as other weaponry and supplies that the nascent [[Continental Army]] would find useful in tightening their grip on Boston.<ref name=\"Chidsey60\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 60</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort Ticonderoga 1775.jpg|thumb|An engraving depicting [[Ethan Allen]] demanding the surrender of [[Fort Ticonderoga]].]]\nBoston lacked a regular supply of fresh food, and many horses needed hay to produce manure. On May 21, Gage ordered a party to go to [[Grape Island (Massachusetts)|Grape Island]], in the [[Boston Harbor|outer harbor]], and bring hay to Boston.<ref name=\"French248\">[[#French|French]], p. 248</ref> When the Continentals on the mainland noticed this, they took alarm, and the militia were called out.

On May 27, in the [[Battle of Chelsea Creek]], the [[Royal Marines|British Marines]] attempted to stop removal of livestock from some of the islands.  The Americans resisted, and, in the course of the action, the British [[HMS Diana (1775)|schooner ''Diana'']] ran aground and was destroyed, but not before the Continentals recovered its weaponry.<ref name=\"French249\"/> In an attempt to help quell the rebellion, Gage issued a proclamation on June 12 offering to pardon all of those who would lay down their arms, with the exception of [[John Hancock]] and [[Samuel Adams]].<ref name=\"French251\">[[#French|French]], p. 251</ref> Instead of quelling the rebellion, it ignited anger among the Patriots, and more people began to take up arms.<ref name=\"French251\"/>\n\n===Breed's Hill===\n{{main|Battle of Bunker Hill}}\n[[File:Bunker Hill by Pyle.jpg|thumb|right|''The Battle of Bunker Hill'', [[Howard Pyle]], 1897]]\nThroughout May, the British had been receiving reinforcements, until they reached a strength of about 6,000 men.  On May 25, three Generals arrived on {{HMS|Cerberus|1758|6}}: [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], [[John Burgoyne]], and [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Henry Clinton]].  Gage began planning to break out of the city.<ref name=French249>[[#French|French]], p. 249</ref>\n\nThe plan decided on by the British command was to fortify both Bunker Hill and Dorchester Heights.  They fixed the date for taking Dorchester Heights at June 18.  On June 15, the colonists' [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] learned of the British plans. In response, they sent instructions to General Ward to fortify Bunker Hill and the heights of Charlestown; he ordered Colonel [[William Prescott]] to do so.  On the night of June 16, Prescott led 1,200 men over the Charlestown Neck, and constructed fortifications on Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill.<ref name=\"French255\">[[#French|French]], pp. 255\u2013258</ref>\n\nOn June 17, in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], British forces under General Howe took the Charlestown peninsula.<ref name=\"French288\">[[#French|French]], p. 288</ref> The British succeeded in their tactical objective of taking the high ground on the Charlestown peninsula, but they suffered significant losses. With some 1,000 men killed or wounded, including 92 officers killed, the British losses were so heavy that there were no further direct attacks on American forces.<ref name=\"French284\">[[#French|French]], p. 284</ref>  The Americans, while losing the battle, had again stood against the British regulars with some success, as they had successfully repelled two assaults on Breed's Hill during the engagement.<ref name=\"French272\">[[#French|French]], pp. 272\u2013273</ref>  From this point, the siege essentially became a [[stalemate]].\n\n===Stalemate===\nGeneral George Washington arrived at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] on July 2. He set up his headquarters at the [[Benjamin Wadsworth#Wadsworth House|Benjamin Wadsworth House]] at [[Harvard College]].<ref>[http://mass.historicbuildingsct.com/?p=32 Benjamin Wadsworth House] from Historic Buildings of Massachusetts.</ref> He took command of the newly formed [[Continental Army]] the following day. By this time forces and supplies were arriving, including companies of [[Rifleman|riflemen]] from as far away as [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]] and [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]].<ref name=\"Chidsey117\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 117</ref>  Washington began the work of molding the militias into something more closely resembling an army, appointing senior officers (where the militias had typically elected their leaders), and introducing more organization and disciplinary measures to the encamped militias.<ref name=\"Chidsey113\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 113</ref> \n\nWashington required officers of different ranks to wear differentiating apparel, so that they might be distinguished from their underlings and superiors.<ref name=\"Chidsey112\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 112</ref> On July 16, he moved his headquarters to the [[Longfellow House\u2013Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site|John Vassall House]], also in Cambridge, that would later become well known as the home of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].  Toward the end of July, about 2,000 riflemen arrived in units raised in [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], Maryland, and Virginia.  The accuracy of the [[rifle]] was previously unknown in New England, and these forces were used to harass the besieged forces.<ref name=\"Frothingham227\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 227\u2013228</ref>\n\n[[File:Washingtoncommandarmy.jpg|thumb|[[George Washington]] taking command of the Army, 1775]]\nWashington also ordered the defenses to be improved.  Trenches were dug on the Boston Neck, and then extended toward Boston. However, these activities had little effect on the British occupation.<ref>[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 10</ref>  The working parties were fired on from time to time, as were sentries guarding the works. On July 30, in retaliation for an American attack, the British pushed back an American advanced guard, and burned a few houses in Roxbury.<ref name=\"French337\">[[#French|French]], p. 337</ref> Four days later, on August 2, an American rifleman was killed, and his body hung up by the neck. In retaliation, other American riflemen marched to the lines and began to attack the British troops. They continued their sharpshooting all day, killing or wounding many of the British, and losing only one man.<ref name=\"McCullough39\"/>\n\nOn August 30, the British made a surprise breakout from the Boston Neck, set fire to a tavern, and withdrew to their defenses.<ref name=\"McCullough39\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 39</ref> On the same night, 300 Americans attacked [[Boston Light|Lighthouse Island]] and burned the lighthouse, killing several British soldiers and capturing 23 at the loss of one life.<ref name=\"McCullough39\"/> On another August night, Washington sent 1,200 men to dig entrenchments on a hill near the Charlestown Neck. Despite a British bombardment, the Americans successfully dug the trenches.<ref name=\"French311\">[[#French|French]], p. 311</ref>\n\nIn early September, Washington began drawing up plans for two moves: first, to dispatch 1,000 men from Boston and [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec]], and second, to launch an attack on Boston.<ref name=\"McCullough50\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 50</ref> Washington felt that he could afford to send some troops to Quebec, as he had received intelligence from British deserters and American spies that the British had no intention of launching an attack from Boston until they were reinforced.<ref name=\"McCullough51\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 51</ref>  On September 11, about 1,100 troops under the command of [[Benedict Arnold]] [[Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec|left for Quebec]].<ref name=\"SmithMarch57\">[[#SmithMarch|Smith]], pp. 57\u201358</ref>  Washington summoned a council of war, and made a case for an all out amphibious assault on Boston, by sending troops across [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] in flat-bottomed boats which could hold 50 men each.<ref name=\"McCullough53\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 53</ref> Washington believed it would be extremely difficult to keep the men together when winter came.

This activity was a precursor to the [[Continental Navy]], which was established in the aftermath of the British [[Burning of Falmouth]] (present-day [[Portland, Maine]]).  The provincial assemblies of Connecticut and Rhode Island had by then also begun arming ships and authorized [[privateer]]ing.<ref name=\"French319\">[[#French|French]], pp. 319\u2013320</ref>\n\nIn early November, 400 British soldiers went to [[Lechmere Square|Lechmere's Point]] on a raiding expedition to acquire some livestock.  They made off with 10 head of cattle, but lost two lives in the skirmish with colonial troops sent to defend the point.<ref name=\"French338\">[[#French|French]], p. 338</ref><ref name=\"Frothingham267\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], p. 267</ref>  On November 29, colonial Captain [[John Manley (naval officer)|John Manley]], commanding the [[schooner]] [[USS Lee (1775)|''Lee'']], captured one of the most valuable prizes of the siege, the British [[brigantine]] ''Nancy'', just outside Boston Harbor. She was carrying a large supply of [[Ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] and military stores intended for the British troops in Boston.<ref name=\"Chidsey133\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 133</ref>\n\nAs winter approached, both sides faced their own problems. The Americans were so short on gunpowder that soldiers were given spears to fight with in the event of a British attack.<ref name=\"McCullough60\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 60</ref> Many of the American troops remained unpaid and many of their enlistments would be up at the end of the year. On the British side Howe, who had replaced Gage as commander in October, was faced with different problems. Wood was so scarce that they began cutting down trees and tearing down wooden buildings, including the Old North Meeting House.<ref name=\"The North End\">p.78</ref>\n\nTo add to this, supplying the city had become increasingly difficult because of winter storms and the rise in rebel privateers.<ref name=\"McCullough60\"/> The British troops were so hungry that many were ready to desert as soon as they could.  Worse, [[scurvy]] and [[smallpox]] had broken out in the city.<ref name=\"McCullough61\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 61</ref> Washington's army faced similar problems with smallpox, as soldiers from rural communities were exposed to the disease. Washington moved infected troops to a separate hospital, the only option then available given the public stigma against inoculation.<ref>Ann M. Becker, \"Smallpox in Washington's Army: Strategic Implications of the Disease During the American Revolutionary War, ''The Journal of Military History,'' Vol. 68 No. 2 (April 2004) 388</ref>\n\nWashington again proposed to assault Boston in October, but his officers thought it best to wait until the harbor had frozen over.<ref name=\"French330\">[[#French|French]], p. 330</ref> In February, when the water had frozen between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder he would try an assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. He had not yet learned how completely he could trust in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.<ref name=\"Fisher1\">[[#Fisher|Fisher]], p. 1</ref><ref name=\"Frothingham295\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 295\u2013296</ref>\n\nIn mid-January, on orders from London, British Major General [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Henry Clinton]] and a small fleet set sail for the Carolinas with 1,500 men.  Their objective was to join forces with additional troops arriving from Europe, and to take a port in the southern colonies for further military operations.<ref name=\"McCullough78\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 78</ref> In early February a British raiding party crossed the ice and burned several farmhouses in Dorchester.<ref name=\"McCullough86\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 86</ref>\n\n==End of the siege==\n[[File:Siegeofbostonartillery.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Knox]] bringing his \"noble train\" of artillery to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]]]\n{{Main|Noble train of artillery}}\nBetween November 1775 and February 1776, Colonel [[Henry Knox]] and a team of engineers used [[sled]]ges to retrieve 60 tons of heavy artillery that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga. Bringing them across the frozen [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]] rivers in a difficult, complex operation, they arrived back at Cambridge on January 24, 1776.<ref name=\"McCullough84\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 84</ref>\n\n===Fortification of Dorchester Heights===\n{{main|Fortification of Dorchester Heights}}\nSome of the Ticonderoga cannons, which were of a size and range not previously available to the Americans, were emplaced in fortifications around the city, and on the night of March 2, 1776, the Americans began to bombard the city with those cannon, to which the British responded with cannonades of their own.<ref name=\"McCullough91\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 91</ref> The American guns, under the direction of Colonel Knox, continued to exchange fire with the British until March 4. The exchange of fire did little damage to either side, although it did damage houses and kill some British soldiers in Boston.<ref name=\"McCullough92\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 92</ref>\n\nOn March 5, Washington moved more of the Ticonderoga cannon and several thousand men overnight to occupy [[Dorchester Heights]], overlooking Boston. Since it was winter, the ground was frozen, which made the digging of trenches impractical.  [[Rufus Putnam]], who had been a millwright, developed a plan to fortify the heights using defenses made of heavy timbers and fascines.  These were prefabricated out of sight of the British, and brought in overnight.<ref>Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

Washington was given the letter, but formally rejected it, as it was not addressed to him by either name or title.<ref name=\"Frothinghame303\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 303\u2013304</ref> However, the letter had the intended effect: when the evacuation began, there was no American fire to hinder the British departure.

It killed four men with one cannonball, but that was all the damage that was done.<ref name=\"McCullough99\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 99</ref> The next day, the colonists went out and collected the 700 cannonballs that had been fired at them.<ref name=\"McCullough99\"/>\n\n[[Image:Boston area colonial map.jpg|thumb|450px|A map showing Boston and vicinity, including Bunker Hill, Dorchester Heights, and the troop disposition of Gen.

A Loyalist, [[Crean Brush]], was authorized to receive these goods, in return for which he gave certificates that were effectively worthless.<ref name=\"McCullough104\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 104</ref> Over the next week, the British fleet sat in Boston harbor waiting for favorable winds, while Loyalists and British soldiers were loaded onto the ships.

Both sides had to deal with resource supply and personnel issues over the course of the siege. British resupply and reinforcement activities were limited to sea access. After eleven months of the siege, the British abandoned Boston by sailing to [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe siege began on April 19 after the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], when the militia from surrounding Massachusetts communities blocked land access to Boston. The [[Continental Congress]] formed the [[Continental Army]] from the militia, with [[George Washington]] as its Commander in Chief. In June 1775, the British [[Battle of Bunker Hill|seized Bunker and Breed's Hills]], from which the Continentals were preparing to bombard the city, but their casualties were heavy and their gains were insufficient to break the Continental Army's hold on land access to Boston. The Americans laid siege to the British-occupied city. Military actions during the remainder of the siege were limited to occasional raids, minor skirmishes, and sniper fire.\n\nIn November 1775, George Washington sent the 25-year-old bookseller-turned-soldier [[Henry Knox]] to bring to Boston the heavy artillery that had been [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured at Fort Ticonderoga]]. In a technically complex and demanding operation, Knox [[Noble train of artillery|brought many cannons to the Boston area]] by January 1776. In March 1776, these artillery [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|fortified Dorchester Heights]] (which overlooked Boston and its harbor), thereby threatening the British supply lifeline. The British commander [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] saw the British position as indefensible and withdrew the British forces in Boston to the British stronghold at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], on March 17.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|American Revolution|Boston campaign}}\n\n[[File:Grand Union Flag.svg|left|upright|thumb|The Grand Union flag flown by George Washington during the Siege of Boston<ref>Ryan P. Randolph, ''Betsy Ross: The American Flag, and Life in a Young America'', p. 38</ref>]]\nPrior to 1775, the British [[Colonial history of the United States#Tax protests lead to Revolution|imposed taxes and import duties]] on the American colonies, to which the inhabitants objected since they [[No taxation without representation|lacked British Parliamentary representation]]. In response to the [[Boston Tea Party]] and other acts of protest, 4,000 British troops under the command of General [[Thomas Gage]] were sent to occupy Boston and to pacify the restive [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]].<ref name=\"Chidsey5\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 5</ref> Parliament authorized Gage, [[Intolerable Acts|among other actions]], to disband the local provincial government (led by [[John Hancock]] and [[Samuel Adams]]). It was reformed into the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress|Provincial Congress]], and continued to meet. The Provincial Congress called for the organization of local militias and coordinated the accumulation of weapons and other military supplies.<ref name=\"FrothinghamProvCong\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 35, 54</ref> Under the terms of the [[Boston Port Act]], Gage closed the Boston port, which caused much unemployment and discontent.<ref name=\"Frothingham7\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], p. 7</ref>\n\n[[File:Lexington Concord Siege of Boston.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1775 map of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] and the Siege of Boston]]\nWhen British forces were sent to seize military supplies from the town of [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] on April 19, 1775, militia companies from surrounding towns opposed them at the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]].<ref name=\"McCullough7\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 7</ref> At Concord, some of the British forces were routed in a confrontation at the [[Old North Bridge|North Bridge]].

They particularly blocked the Charlestown Neck (the only land access to Charlestown), and the [[Boston Neck]] (the only land access to Boston, which was then [[Shawmut Peninsula|a peninsula]]), leaving only the harbor and sea access under British control.<ref name=\"Frothingham100\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\nIn the days immediately following the creation of the siege line, the size of the colonial forces grew, as militias from [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] arrived on the scene.<ref name=\"Frothingham100\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 100\u2013101</ref> General Gage wrote of his surprise of the number of rebels surrounding the city: \"The rebels are not the despicable rabble too many have supposed them to be....In all their wars against the French they never showed such conduct, attention, and perseverance as they do now.\"<ref name=\"Harvey1\">[[#Harvey|Harvey]], p. 1</ref>\n\nGeneral Gage turned his attention to fortifying easily defensible positions. In the south, at Roxbury, Gage ordered lines of defenses with 10 twenty-four pound guns. In Boston proper, four hills were quickly fortified. They were to be the main defense of the city.<ref>[[#French|French]], p. 236</ref> Over time, each of these hills was strengthened.<ref>[[#French|French]], p. 237</ref> Gage also decided to abandon Charlestown, removing the beleaguered forces (that had retreated from Concord) to Boston.  The town of Charlestown itself was entirely vacant, and the high lands of Charlestown (Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill) were left undefended, as were the [[Dorchester Heights|heights of Dorchester]], which had a commanding view of the harbor and the city.<ref name=\"FrenchUndefended\">[[#French|French]], pp. 126\u2013128,220</ref>\n\nThe British at first greatly restricted movement in and out of the city, fearing infiltration of weapons.  Besieged and besiegers eventually reached an informal agreement allowing traffic on the Boston Neck, provided no firearms were carried.  Residents of Boston turned in almost 2,000 muskets, and most of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] residents left the city.<ref name=\"Chidsey53\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 53</ref>  Many [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who lived outside the city of Boston left their homes and fled into the city. Most of them felt that it was not safe to live outside of the city, because the Patriots were now in control of the countryside.<ref name=\"French228\">[[#French|French]], p. 228</ref>  Some of the men, after arriving in Boston, joined Loyalist regiments attached to the British army.<ref name=\"French234\">[[#French|French]], p. 234</ref>\n\nBecause the siege did not blockade the harbor, the city remained open for the [[Royal Navy]], under [[Samuel Graves|Vice Admiral Samuel Graves]], to bring in supplies from [[Nova Scotia]] and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the [[Command of the sea|naval supremacy]] of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information about what was happening in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.<ref name=\"McCullough118\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 118</ref>\n\n===Early skirmishes===\nOn May 3, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress authorized [[Benedict Arnold]] to raise forces for taking [[Fort Ticonderoga]] near the southern end of [[Lake Champlain]] in the [[Province of New York]], which was known to have heavy weapons, but to be only lightly defended.  Arnold arrived in [[Castleton, Vermont|Castleton]] (in what is now [[Vermont]], but was then [[New Hampshire Grants|disputed territory]] between New York and New Hampshire) on the 9th, where he joined with [[Ethan Allen]] and a militia company from Connecticut, all of whom had independently arrived at the idea of taking Ticonderoga.  This company, under the joint leadership of Arnold and Allen, [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured Fort Ticonderoga]] and [[Fort Crown Point]].  They also captured the one large military vessel on Lake Champlain in a raid on [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)|Fort Saint-Jean]].<ref name=\"Fisher318\">[[#Fisher|Fisher]], pp. 318\u2013321</ref>  They recovered over 180 cannons, as well as other weaponry and supplies that the nascent [[Continental Army]] would find useful in tightening their grip on Boston.<ref name=\"Chidsey60\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 60</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort Ticonderoga 1775.jpg|thumb|An engraving depicting [[Ethan Allen]] demanding the surrender of [[Fort Ticonderoga]].]]\nBoston lacked a regular supply of fresh meat, and many horses needed hay. On May 21, Gage ordered a party to go to [[Grape Island (Massachusetts)|Grape Island]], in the [[Boston Harbor|outer harbor]], and bring hay to Boston.<ref name=\"French248\">[[#French|French]], p. 248</ref> When the Continentals on the mainland noticed this, they took alarm, and the militia were called out. As the British party arrived, they came under fire from the militia. The militia set fire to a barn on the island, destroying 80 tons of hay, and prevented the British from taking more than 3 tons.<ref name=\"French248\"/>\n\nContinental forces, partly in response to the Grape Island incident, worked to clear the harbor islands of livestock and supplies useful to the British.  On May 27, in the [[Battle of Chelsea Creek]], the [[Royal Marines|British Marines]] attempted to stop removal of livestock from some of the islands.  The Americans resisted, and, in the course of the action, the British [[HMS Diana (1775)|schooner ''Diana'']] ran aground and was destroyed, but not before the Continentals recovered its weaponry.<ref name=\"French249\"/> In an attempt to help quell the rebellion, Gage issued a proclamation on June 12 offering to pardon all of those who would lay down their arms, with the exception of [[John Hancock]] and [[Samuel Adams]].<ref name=\"French251\">[[#French|French]], p. 251</ref> Instead of quelling the rebellion, it ignited anger among the Patriots, and more people began to take up arms.<ref name=\"French251\"/>\n\n===Breed's Hill===\n{{main|Battle of Bunker Hill}}\n[[File:Bunker Hill by Pyle.jpg|thumb|right|''The Battle of Bunker Hill'', [[Howard Pyle]], 1897]]\nThroughout May, the British had been receiving reinforcements, until they reached a strength of about 6,000 men.  On May 25, three Generals arrived on {{HMS|Cerberus|1758|6}}: [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], [[John Burgoyne]], and [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Henry Clinton]].  Gage began planning to break out of the city.<ref name=French249>[[#French|French]], p. 249</ref>\n\nThe plan decided on by the British command was to fortify both Bunker Hill and Dorchester Heights.  They fixed the date for taking Dorchester Heights at June 18.  On June 15, the colonists' [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] learned of the British plans. In response, they sent instructions to General Ward to fortify Bunker Hill and the heights of Charlestown; he ordered Colonel [[William Prescott]] to do so.  On the night of June 16, Prescott led 1,200 men over the Charlestown Neck, and constructed fortifications on Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill.<ref name=\"French255\">[[#French|French]], pp. 255\u2013258</ref>\n\nOn June 17, in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], British forces under General Howe took the Charlestown peninsula.<ref name=\"French288\">[[#French|French]], p. 288</ref> The British succeeded in their tactical objective of taking the high ground on the Charlestown peninsula, but they suffered significant losses. With some 1,000 men killed or wounded, including 92 officers killed, the British losses were so heavy that there were no further direct attacks on American forces.<ref name=\"French284\">[[#French|French]], p. 284</ref>  The Americans, while losing the battle, had again stood against the British regulars with some success, as they had successfully repelled two assaults on Breed's Hill during the engagement.<ref name=\"French272\">[[#French|French]], pp. 272\u2013273</ref>  From this point, the siege essentially became a [[stalemate]].\n\n===Stalemate===\nGeneral George Washington arrived at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] on July 2. He set up his headquarters at the [[Benjamin Wadsworth#Wadsworth House|Benjamin Wadsworth House]] at [[Harvard College]].<ref>[http://mass.historicbuildingsct.com/?p=32 Benjamin Wadsworth House] from Historic Buildings of Massachusetts.</ref> He took command of the newly formed [[Continental Army]] the following day. By this time forces and supplies were arriving, including companies of [[Rifleman|riflemen]] from as far away as [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]] and [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]].<ref name=\"Chidsey117\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 117</ref>  Washington began the work of molding the militias into something more closely resembling an army, appointing senior officers (where the militias had typically elected their leaders), and introducing more organization and disciplinary measures to the encamped militias.<ref name=\"Chidsey113\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 113</ref> \n\nWashington required officers of different ranks to wear differentiating apparel, so that they might be distinguished from their underlings and superiors.<ref name=\"Chidsey112\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 112</ref> On July 16, he moved his headquarters to the [[Longfellow House\u2013Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site|John Vassall House]], also in Cambridge, that would later become well known as the home of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].  Toward the end of July, about 2,000 riflemen arrived in units raised in [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], Maryland, and Virginia.  The accuracy of the [[rifle]] was previously unknown in New England, and these forces were used to harass the besieged forces.<ref name=\"Frothingham227\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 227\u2013228</ref>\n\n[[File:Washingtoncommandarmy.jpg|thumb|[[George Washington]] taking command of the Army, 1775]]\nWashington also ordered the defenses to be improved.  Trenches were dug on the Boston Neck, and then extended toward Boston. However, these activities had little effect on the British occupation.<ref>[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 10</ref>  The working parties were fired on from time to time, as were sentries guarding the works. On July 30, in retaliation for an American attack, the British pushed back an American advanced guard, and burned a few houses in Roxbury.<ref name=\"French337\">[[#French|French]], p. 337</ref> Four days later, on August 2, an American rifleman was killed, and his body hung up by the neck. In retaliation, other American riflemen marched to the lines and began to attack the British troops. They continued their sharpshooting all day, killing or wounding many of the British, and losing only one man.<ref name=\"McCullough39\"/>\n\nOn August 30, the British made a surprise breakout from the Boston Neck, set fire to a tavern, and withdrew to their defenses.<ref name=\"McCullough39\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 39</ref> On the same night, 300 Americans attacked [[Boston Light|Lighthouse Island]] and burned the lighthouse, killing several British soldiers and capturing 23 at the loss of one life.<ref name=\"McCullough39\"/> On another August night, Washington sent 1,200 men to dig entrenchments on a hill near the Charlestown Neck. Despite a British bombardment, the Americans successfully dug the trenches.<ref name=\"French311\">[[#French|French]], p. 311</ref>\n\nIn early September, Washington began drawing up plans for two moves: first, to dispatch 1,000 men from Boston and [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec]], and second, to launch an attack on Boston.<ref name=\"McCullough50\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 50</ref> Washington felt that he could afford to send some troops to Quebec, as he had received intelligence from British deserters and American spies that the British had no intention of launching an attack from Boston until they were reinforced.<ref name=\"McCullough51\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 51</ref>  On September 11, about 1,100 troops under the command of [[Benedict Arnold]] [[Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec|left for Quebec]].<ref name=\"SmithMarch57\">[[#SmithMarch|Smith]], pp. 57\u201358</ref>  Washington summoned a council of war, and made a case for an all out amphibious assault on Boston, by sending troops across [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] in flat-bottomed boats which could hold 50 men each.<ref name=\"McCullough53\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 53</ref> Washington believed it would be extremely difficult to keep the men together when winter came. In a war council, the plan was unanimously rejected, and the decision was not to attack \"for the present at least.\"<ref name=\"McCullough53\"/>\n\n[[File:Boston, 1775bsmall1.png|thumb|right|The British defenses in [[Boston]], 1775]]\nIn early September Washington authorized the appropriation and outfitting of local fishing vessels for intelligence-gathering and interdiction of supplies to the British.  This activity was a precursor to the [[Continental Navy]], which was established in the aftermath of the British [[Burning of Falmouth]] (present-day [[Portland, Maine]]).  The provincial assemblies of Connecticut and Rhode Island had by then also begun arming ships and authorized [[privateer]]ing.<ref name=\"French319\">[[#French|French]], pp. 319\u2013320</ref>\n\nIn early November, 400 British soldiers went to [[Lechmere Square|Lechmere's Point]] on a raiding expedition to acquire some livestock.  They made off with 10 head of cattle, but lost two lives in the skirmish with colonial troops sent to defend the point.<ref name=\"French338\">[[#French|French]], p. 338</ref><ref name=\"Frothingham267\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], p. 267</ref>  On November 29, colonial Captain [[John Manley (naval officer)|John Manley]], commanding the [[schooner]] [[USS Lee (1775)|''Lee'']], captured one of the most valuable prizes of the siege, the British [[brigantine]] ''Nancy'', just outside Boston Harbor. She was carrying a large supply of [[Ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] and military stores intended for the British troops in Boston.<ref name=\"Chidsey133\">[[#Chidsey|Chidsey]], p. 133</ref>\n\nAs winter approached, both sides faced their own problems. The Americans were so short on gunpowder that soldiers were given spears to fight with in the event of a British attack.<ref name=\"McCullough60\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 60</ref> Many of the American troops remained unpaid and many of their enlistments would be up at the end of the year. On the British side Howe, who had replaced Gage as commander in October, was faced with different problems. Wood was so scarce that they began cutting down trees and tearing down wooden buildings, including the Old North Meeting House.<ref name=\"The North End\">p.78</ref>\n\nTo add to this, supplying the city had become increasingly difficult because of winter storms and the rise in rebel privateers.<ref name=\"McCullough60\"/> The British troops were so hungry that many were ready to desert as soon as they could.  Worse, [[scurvy]] and [[smallpox]] had broken out in the city.<ref name=\"McCullough61\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 61</ref> Washington's army faced similar problems with smallpox, as soldiers from rural communities were exposed to the disease. Washington moved infected troops to a separate hospital, the only option then available given the public stigma against inoculation.<ref>Ann M. Becker, \"Smallpox in Washington's Army: Strategic Implications of the Disease During the American Revolutionary War, ''The Journal of Military History,'' Vol. 68 No. 2 (April 2004) 388</ref>\n\nWashington again proposed to assault Boston in October, but his officers thought it best to wait until the harbor had frozen over.<ref name=\"French330\">[[#French|French]], p. 330</ref> In February, when the water had frozen between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder he would try an assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. He had not yet learned how completely he could trust in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.<ref name=\"Fisher1\">[[#Fisher|Fisher]], p. 1</ref><ref name=\"Frothingham295\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 295\u2013296</ref>\n\nIn mid-January, on orders from London, British Major General [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Henry Clinton]] and a small fleet set sail for the Carolinas with 1,500 men.  Their objective was to join forces with additional troops arriving from Europe, and to take a port in the southern colonies for further military operations.<ref name=\"McCullough78\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 78</ref> In early February a British raiding party crossed the ice and burned several farmhouses in Dorchester.<ref name=\"McCullough86\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 86</ref>\n\n==End of the siege==\n[[File:Siegeofbostonartillery.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Knox]] bringing his \"noble train\" of artillery to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]]]\n{{Main|Noble train of artillery}}\nBetween November 1775 and February 1776, Colonel [[Henry Knox]] and a team of engineers used [[sled]]ges to retrieve 60 tons of heavy artillery that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga.

The exchange of fire did little damage to either side, although it did damage houses and kill some British soldiers in Boston.<ref name=\"McCullough92\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 92</ref>\n\nOn March 5, Washington moved more of the Ticonderoga cannon and several thousand men overnight to occupy [[Dorchester Heights]], overlooking Boston. Since it was winter, the ground was frozen, which made the digging of trenches impractical.  [[Rufus Putnam]], who had been a millwright, developed a plan to fortify the heights using defenses made of heavy timbers and fascines.

Washington was given the letter, but formally rejected it, as it was not addressed to him by either name or title.<ref name=\"Frothinghame303\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 303\u2013304</ref> However, the letter had the intended effect: when the evacuation began, there was no American fire to hinder the British departure.  On March 9, after seeing movement on Nook's Hill on Dorchester, the British opened a massive fire  barrage that lasted all night. It killed four men with one cannonball, but that was all the damage that was done.<ref name=\"McCullough99\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 99</ref> The next day, the colonists went out and collected the 700 cannonballs that had been fired at them.<ref name=\"McCullough99\"/>\n\n[[Image:Boston area colonial map.jpg|thumb|450px|A map showing Boston and vicinity, including Bunker Hill, Dorchester Heights, and the troop disposition of Gen.

A Loyalist, [[Crean Brush]], was authorized to receive these goods, in return for which he gave certificates that were effectively worthless.<ref name=\"McCullough104\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 104</ref> Over the next week, the British fleet sat in Boston harbor waiting for favorable winds, while Loyalists and British soldiers were loaded onto the ships. During this time, American naval activities outside the harbor successfully captured and diverted to ports under colonial control several British supply ships.<ref name=\"Frothingham308\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], p. 308</ref> \n\nOn March 15, the wind became favorable, but before they could leave, it turned against them. On March 17, the wind once again turned favorable. The troops, who were authorized to burn the town if there were any disturbances while they were marching to their ships,<ref name=\"McCullough104\"/> began to move out at 4:00&nbsp;a.m. By 9:00&nbsp;a.m., all ships were underway.<ref name=\"Frothingham309\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], p. 309</ref> The fleet departing from Boston included 120 ships, with more than 11,000 people aboard. Of those, 9,906 were British troops, 667 were women, and 553 were children.<ref name=\"McCullough105\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 105</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Americans clean up===\nOnce the British fleet sailed away, the Americans moved to reclaim Boston and Charlestown. At first, they thought that the British were still on Bunker Hill, but it turned out that the British had left dummies in place.<ref name=\"McCullough105\"/> Due to the risk of smallpox, at first only men picked for their prior exposure to the disease entered Boston under the command of Artemas Ward.  More of the colonial army entered on March 20, 1776, once the risk of disease was judged low.<ref name=\"Frothingham310\">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], pp. 310\u2013311</ref>  While Washington had essentially acceded to the British threat to burn Boston, and had not hindered their departure from the city, he did not make their escape from the outer harbor entirely easy.  He directed Captain Manley to harass the departing British fleet, in which he had some success, capturing among other prizes the ship carrying Crean Brush and his plunder.<ref name=\"French429\">[[#French|French]], p. 429</ref>\n\nGeneral Howe, when his fleet finally left the outer harbor, left in his wake a small contingent of vessels whose primary purpose was to intercept any arriving British vessels.  While they successfully redirected to Halifax numerous ships carrying British troops originally destined for Boston, some unsuspecting British troop ships landed in Boston, only to fall into American hands.<ref name=\"French436\">[[#French|French]], p. 436</ref>\n\nThe British departure ended major military activities in the New England colonies.  Washington, fearing that the British were going to attack New York City, departed on April 4 with his army for [[Manhattan]], beginning the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]].<ref name=\"McCullough112\">[[#McCullough|McCullough]], p. 112</ref>\n\nThere are six units of the Army National Guard (101st Eng Bn,<ref>Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 101st Engineer Battalion</ref> 125th MP Co,<ref>{{cite web|title=Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 125th Quartermaster Company |url=http://states.ng.mil/sites/MA/News/Pages/125th%20Quartermaster%20Company%20honored%20for%20storied%20lineage%20and%20service%20at%20Lexington%20and%20Concord.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218191827/http://states.ng.mil/sites/MA/News/Pages/125th%20Quartermaster%20Company%20honored%20for%20storied%20lineage%20and%20service%20at%20Lexington%20and%20Concord.aspx |work=Massachusetts National Guard |archivedate=December 18, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 181st Inf,<ref>Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 181st Infantry.

General Gage never received another combat command.  General Burgoyne would see action in the [[Saratoga campaign]], a disaster that saw his capture, as well as that of 7,500 troops under his command.  General Clinton would command the British forces in America for four years (1778\u20131782).<ref name=\"French437\">[[#French|French]], pp. 437\u2013438</ref>\n\n===Fate of the Loyalists===\nMany Massachusetts Loyalists left with the British when they evacuated Boston.  Some went to England to rebuild lives there, and some returned to America after the war.  Many stayed in [[Nova Scotia]], settling in places like [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], and many became active in the future development of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]].<ref name=\"French439\">[[#French|French]], pp. 438\u2013439</ref>\n\n===Fate of Boston===\nFollowing the siege, Boston effectively ceased to be a military target, but continued to be a focal point for revolutionary activities, with its port acting as an important point for fitting ships of war and privateers.
