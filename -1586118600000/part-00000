The situation of this place is on the river ''Croke'', 156 miles from London. The prosperity and opulence of this town, like the former [Northwich], may be said to be, principally, ''preserved'' by ''salt''; very considerable quantities being made here. Its weekly market is on a Tuesday; and its two fairs are annually held on 25 July, and on Holy Thursday. Middlewich is a deanery, hath burgesses, and other privileges, as the rest of the ''Wiches'' have.  Half a mile N. E. from the town is the goodly manor-place of Kinderton, belonging to Lord Vernon, called ''The Barn of Kinderton''. The town is well build, and a desirable place of residence not only for pleasantness of situation, but, what is far better, for the friendly and hospitable disposition of its inhabitants.\n\nThe directory goes on to list 4 esquires, 3 gentleman, 4 attorneys, 3 surgeons, a cheese factor, two publicans (of the Kings Arms and the White Bear), a school master, 2 haberdashers, a chandler, 2 tanners, 3 salt proprietors, 3 mercers, 2 clock makers, a timber merchant, a medicine vendor, a grocer, a book seller, a glazier and a keeper of the house of correction.\n\n===Middlewich in 1850===\n''The following is adapted from<ref>{{cite web | title=Middlewich 1850 | work=Northwich, Cheshire, UK.

Middlewich parish in 1850 comprised Byley-cum-Yatehouse, Clive or Cliff (now part of [[Winsford]], Croxton, Kinderton-cum-Hulme, Middlewich, Minshull Vernon (near [[Crewe]]), Moresbarrow-cum-Parme, Newton, Occleston, Ravenscroft, Sproston, Stublach, Sutton, Wimboldsley, and Weaver, (now Winsford). The total population of the parish was 4,755.\n\nMiddlewich in 1850 comprised {{convert|24|acre|m2}} of land, with its principal works being the surrounding farming district, a silk factory, and the salt works in Kinderton and Newton. A list of [[public houses]] was recorded and the following seven are still present today (although not necessarily in the same buildings): Boars Head; Golden Lion; King's Arms; Old Cheshire Cheese; Red Lion (now Cats Bar); White Bear and White Horse.\n\n===Arrival of Railways in 1867/68===\n{{main article|Middlewich railway station}}\n\nRailways arrived in the Middlewich area in 1867 when the [[London and North Western Railway]] built a branch line from Sandbach to Northwich.  The line was used for freight, including carriage of salt, from its opening in November 1867. A railway station was built at Middlewich, opening on 1 July 1868. Later, small \"halts\" were built at '''Cledford Bridge''' south of the town and '''Billinge Green''' north of the town, but these had a relatively short life.  Middlewich station closed on 4 January 1960 The Middlewich branch line is still used by freight trains and occasional passenger specials.\n\n===Middlewich in 1887===\n\"Middlewich, town, par., and township, Cheshire, 5\u00bd miles SE. of North wich and 166 NW. of London by rail \u2013 par., 13,110 ac., pop. 5205; township, 37 ac., pop. 1325; town, 238 ac., pop. 3379; P.O., T.O., 1 Bank, 1 newspaper. Middlewich was held by the Earl of Mercia under Edward the Confessor. The town has an antique appearance. The trade is chiefly in salt, obtained from brine springs in the neighbourhood; there are small silk and fustian factories, and considerable quantities of fruit and vegetables are raised in the vicinity for the Liverpool and Manchester markets.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=John | last=Bartholomew | title=Gazetteer of the British Isles | year=1887 }}</ref>\n\n===1889 football violence===\nMiddlewich Station was host to a fight between [[association football|Football]] supporters from [[Crewe]] and [[Nantwich]] in 1889 in which the platform occupied by Crewe fans was stormed by the Nantwich fans and many sustained injuries.<ref>{{cite web | title=Historical examples of violent incidents in Britain to 1960 | work=Football Violence in Europe | url=http://www.sirc.org/publik/fvhist.html#_VPID_23 | accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref>\n\n===Middlewich in 1910\u201311 from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition===\n\"Middlewich, an urban district in the Northwich parliamentary division of Cheshire, England, 166m N.W. of London, on the London & North Western railway. Pop. (1901) 4669.  It lies in open country near the river Dane, having water communications by the Trent and Mersey canal, and a branch giving access to the Shropshire Union canal.  The church of St Michael and All Angels is of various periods and contains numerous [[monument]]s.  In the streets not a few old buildings remain, making for picturesqueness, and a number of the fine [[Timber framing#English tradition|timbered houses]] in which Cheshire abounds are seen in the immediate neighbourhood.  Middlewich shares in the salt industry common to several towns, such as Northwich and Winsford, in this part of the country; there are also chemical works and a manufacture of [[condensed milk]].\"\n\n===The First and Second World Wars===\n\n[[Image:Middlewich - Cenotaph unveiling.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Unveiling of the cenotaph]]\n\nIn common with the rest of the United Kingdom, Middlewich suffered a decimation of its young male population during the First World War.  The [[cenotaph]] near to the parish church ([[media:Middlewich - Cenotaph.jpg|Image]]) lists the names of 136 men who died in this conflict, representing around 10% of the male population of the town aged between 15 and 45 years.  Forty two inhabitants of Middlewich lost their lives in the Second World War, with a further death in the [[Korean War]].  The [[Brunner Mond]] salt works in Brooks Lane also erected a cenotaph in memory of the 16 men from the works who fell in the First World War, and the two men from the works who fell in the Second World War ([[media:Middlewich - Brunner Cenotaph.jpg|Image]]).<ref>15 of the 16 names from the First World War are duplicated on the town cenotaph, as are both from the Second World War.  The one not occurring on the town cenotaph is Arthur Harrison.</ref>\n\n===The post war years===\nThe period between the First and Second World Wars and following the Second World War saw extensive housebuilding within the town, with significant new houses being built in the King Street area to the north, Cledford to the south and the Nantwich Road/St. Annes Road region to the West.\n\nThe 1970s commenced with the building of a new road, St. Michael's Way, which allowed traffic moving from east to west through the town to bypass the main shopping area of Wheelock Street. During the construction of this bypass the Talbot public house on the town bridge was demolished, along with a number of shops opposite the Boar's Head public house, and houses on Lower Street/Pepper Street adjacent to St Michael and All Angels Church. This bypass successfully eased the flow of traffic away from the main shopping street, but the confluence of three major roads remains a bottleneck, which will be eased by a proposed eastern bypass.<ref>{{cite web|title=Middlewich Eastern Bypass (Southern Section) |work=Envioronmental Statement, Non-Technical Summary |url=http://www.cw10residents.co.uk/shopping/standard/images/1212_76_file_finalntsbypassdtp9.pdf |accessdate=2006-05-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062454/http://www.cw10residents.co.uk/shopping/standard/images/1212_76_file_finalntsbypassdtp9.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the early 1980s Middlewich has seen a significant quantity of new housing development, initially in the Sutton Lane and Hayhurst Avenue areas. New developments have recently been built on the sites of old salt workings to the south of the Roman Fort at Harbutt's Field, and near to the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Baron]]'s moated [[manor house]] at Kinderton Manor.\n\nIn common with many local towns, for example [[Holmes Chapel]], [[Northwich]] and [[Winsford]] people are attracted to the area because of good road links via the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and the relatively low price and availability of suitable building land.\n\nMiddlewich [[town centre]], unlike the centres of other local towns such as [[Northwich]] and [[Winsford]], was not heavily remodelled as a [[shopping]] centre during the 1970s and consequently many of the original shops remain. This contrasts with, for example, Winsford, where the High Street was demolished and replaced by Winsford Shopping Centre. However Middlewich has not capitalised on the potentials of this [[wiktionary:quaint|quaintness]], and since there are no large supermarkets in the town, it has failed in becoming a shopping destination for residents of other towns.\n\n==Salt production in Middlewich==\n{{main article|History of salt in Middlewich}}\n\nSalt manufacture has remained the principal industry for the past 2,000 years. Salt making is mentioned in the [[Domesday book]], and by the 13th century there were approximately 100 \"wich houses\" packed around the towns two brine pits.<ref name=BARRY>{{cite book | first=Mary | last=Barry |  title=Memories of Middlewich | year=1972}}</ref> By 1908 there were nine industrial scale salt manufacturers in the town, with a number of open pan salt works close to the Canal, however salt manufacture in Middlewich is now concentrated in one manufacturer, [[British Salt]], who sell under the name [[Saxa (food product)|Saxa]], and also through third parties e.g. supermarket own brands.  Salt produced by British Salt in Middlewich has 57% of the UK market for salt used in cooking.<ref>{{cite web | title=Factors affecting rivalry in the relevant market prior to the merger | work=A report on the acquisisition by British Salt Limited of New Cheshire Salt Works Limited | url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/2005/fulltext/505.pdf#page=37 | accessdate=2006-05-21 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109013018/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/2005/fulltext/505.pdf#page=37 | archivedate=9 January 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Population changes==\n[[Image:Middlewich Population.svg|right|thumb|400px|Increase in the Population of Middlewich over the last 200 years]]\n\nThe figure to the right shows how the population of Middlewich rose through the 19th and 20th centuries.

The situation of this place is on the river ''Croke'', 156 miles from London. The prosperity and opulence of this town, like the former [Northwich], may be said to be, principally, ''preserved'' by ''salt''; very considerable quantities being made here. Its weekly market is on a Tuesday; and its two fairs are annually held on 25 July, and on Holy Thursday. Middlewich is a deanery, hath burgesses, and other privileges, as the rest of the ''Wiches'' have.  Half a mile N. E. from the town is the goodly manor-place of Kinderton, belonging to Lord Vernon, called ''The Barn of Kinderton''. The town is well build, and a desirable place of residence not only for pleasantness of situation, but, what is far better, for the friendly and hospitable disposition of its inhabitants.\n\nThe directory goes on to list 4 esquires, 3 gentleman, 4 attorneys, 3 surgeons, a cheese factor, two publicans (of the Kings Arms and the White Bear), a school master, 2 haberdashers, a chandler, 2 tanners, 3 salt proprietors, 3 mercers, 2 clock makers, a timber merchant, a medicine vendor, a grocer, a book seller, a glazier and a keeper of the house of correction.\n\n===Middlewich in 1850===\n''The following is adapted from<ref>{{cite web | title=Middlewich 1850 | work=Northwich, Cheshire, UK.

Middlewich parish in 1850 comprised Byley-cum-Yatehouse, Clive or Cliff (now part of [[Winsford]], Croxton, Kinderton-cum-Hulme, Middlewich, Minshull Vernon (near [[Crewe]]), Moresbarrow-cum-Parme, Newton, Occleston, Ravenscroft, Sproston, Stublach, Sutton, Wimboldsley, and Weaver, (now Winsford). The total population of the parish was 4,755.\n\nMiddlewich in 1850 comprised {{convert|24|acre|m2}} of land, with its principal works being the surrounding farming district, a silk factory, and the salt works in Kinderton and Newton. A list of [[public houses]] was recorded and the following seven are still present today (although not necessarily in the same buildings): Boars Head; Golden Lion; King\u2019s Arms; Old Cheshire Cheese; Red Lion (now Cats Bar); White Bear and White Horse.\n\n===Arrival of Railways in 1867/68===\n{{main article|Middlewich railway station}}\n\nRailways arrived in the Middlewich area in 1867 when the [[London and North Western Railway]] built a branch line from Sandbach to Northwich.  The line was used for freight, including carriage of salt, from its opening in November 1867. A railway station was built at Middlewich, opening on 1 July 1868. Later, small \"halts\" were built at '''Cledford Bridge''' south of the town and '''Billinge Green''' north of the town, but these had a relatively short life.  Middlewich station closed on 4 January 1960 The Middlewich branch line is still used by freight trains and occasional passenger specials.\n\n===Middlewich in 1887===\n\"Middlewich, town, par., and township, Cheshire, 5\u00bd miles SE. of North wich and 166 NW. of London by rail \u2013 par., 13,110 ac., pop. 5205; township, 37 ac., pop. 1325; town, 238 ac., pop. 3379; P.O., T.O., 1 Bank, 1 newspaper. Middlewich was held by the Earl of Mercia under Edward the Confessor. The town has an antique appearance. The trade is chiefly in salt, obtained from brine springs in the neighbourhood; there are small silk and fustian factories, and considerable quantities of fruit and vegetables are raised in the vicinity for the Liverpool and Manchester markets.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=John | last=Bartholomew | title=Gazetteer of the British Isles | year=1887 }}</ref>\n\n===1889 football violence===\nMiddlewich Station was host to a fight between [[association football|Football]] supporters from [[Crewe]] and [[Nantwich]] in 1889 in which the platform occupied by Crewe fans was stormed by the Nantwich fans and many sustained injuries.<ref>{{cite web | title=Historical examples of violent incidents in Britain to 1960 | work=Football Violence in Europe | url=http://www.sirc.org/publik/fvhist.html#_VPID_23 | accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref>\n\n===Middlewich in 1910\u201311 from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition===\n\"Middlewich, an urban district in the Northwich parliamentary division of Cheshire, England, 166m N.W. of London, on the London & North Western railway. Pop. (1901) 4669.  It lies in open country near the river Dane, having water communications by the Trent and Mersey canal, and a branch giving access to the Shropshire Union canal.  The church of St Michael and All Angels is of various periods and contains numerous [[monument]]s.  In the streets not a few old buildings remain, making for picturesqueness, and a number of the fine [[Timber framing#English tradition|timbered houses]] in which Cheshire abounds are seen in the immediate neighbourhood.  Middlewich shares in the salt industry common to several towns, such as Northwich and Winsford, in this part of the country; there are also chemical works and a manufacture of [[condensed milk]].\"\n\n===The First and Second World Wars===\n\n[[Image:Middlewich - Cenotaph unveiling.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Unveiling of the cenotaph]]\n\nIn common with the rest of the United Kingdom, Middlewich suffered a decimation of its young male population during the First World War.  The [[cenotaph]] near to the parish church ([[media:Middlewich - Cenotaph.jpg|Image]]) lists the names of 136 men who died in this conflict, representing around 10% of the male population of the town aged between 15 and 45 years.  Forty two inhabitants of Middlewich lost their lives in the Second World War, with a further death in the [[Korean War]].  The [[Brunner Mond]] salt works in Brooks Lane also erected a cenotaph in memory of the 16 men from the works who fell in the First World War, and the two men from the works who fell in the Second World War ([[media:Middlewich - Brunner Cenotaph.jpg|Image]]).<ref>15 of the 16 names from the First World War are duplicated on the town cenotaph, as are both from the Second World War.  The one not occurring on the town cenotaph is Arthur Harrison.</ref>\n\n===The post war years===\nThe period between the First and Second World Wars and following the Second World War saw extensive housebuilding within the town, with significant new houses being built in the King Street area to the north, Cledford to the south and the Nantwich Road/St. Annes Road region to the West.\n\nThe 1970s commenced with the building of a new road, St. Michael's Way, which allowed traffic moving from east to west through the town to bypass the main shopping area of Wheelock Street. During the construction of this bypass the Talbot public house on the town bridge was demolished, along with a number of shops opposite the Boar's Head public house, and houses on Lower Street/Pepper Street adjacent to St Michael and All Angels Church. This bypass successfully eased the flow of traffic away from the main shopping street, but the confluence of three major roads remains a bottleneck, which will be eased by a proposed eastern bypass.<ref>{{cite web|title=Middlewich Eastern Bypass (Southern Section) |work=Envioronmental Statement, Non-Technical Summary |url=http://www.cw10residents.co.uk/shopping/standard/images/1212_76_file_finalntsbypassdtp9.pdf |accessdate=2006-05-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062454/http://www.cw10residents.co.uk/shopping/standard/images/1212_76_file_finalntsbypassdtp9.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the early 1980s Middlewich has seen a significant quantity of new housing development, initially in the Sutton Lane and Hayhurst Avenue areas. New developments have recently been built on the sites of old salt workings to the south of the Roman Fort at Harbutt's Field, and near to the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Baron]]'s moated [[manor house]] at Kinderton Manor.\n\nIn common with many local towns, for example [[Holmes Chapel]], [[Northwich]] and [[Winsford]] people are attracted to the area because of good road links via the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and the relatively low price and availability of suitable building land.\n\nMiddlewich [[town centre]], unlike the centres of other local towns such as [[Northwich]] and [[Winsford]], was not heavily remodelled as a [[shopping]] centre during the 1970s and consequently many of the original shops remain. This contrasts with, for example, Winsford, where the High Street was demolished and replaced by Winsford Shopping Centre. However Middlewich has not capitalised on the potentials of this [[wiktionary:quaint|quaintness]], and since there are no large supermarkets in the town, it has failed in becoming a shopping destination for residents of other towns.\n\n==Salt production in Middlewich==\n{{main article|History of salt in Middlewich}}\n\nSalt manufacture has remained the principal industry for the past 2,000 years. Salt making is mentioned in the [[Domesday book]], and by the 13th century there were approximately 100 \"wich houses\" packed around the towns two brine pits.<ref name=BARRY>{{cite book | first=Mary | last=Barry |  title=Memories of Middlewich | year=1972}}</ref> By 1908 there were nine industrial scale salt manufacturers in the town, with a number of open pan salt works close to the Canal, however salt manufacture in Middlewich is now concentrated in one manufacturer, [[British Salt]], who sell under the name [[Saxa (food product)|Saxa]], and also through third parties e.g. supermarket own brands.  Salt produced by British Salt in Middlewich has 57% of the UK market for salt used in cooking.<ref>{{cite web | title=Factors affecting rivalry in the relevant market prior to the merger | work=A report on the acquisisition by British Salt Limited of New Cheshire Salt Works Limited | url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/2005/fulltext/505.pdf#page=37 | accessdate=2006-05-21 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109013018/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/2005/fulltext/505.pdf#page=37 | archivedate=9 January 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Population changes==\n[[Image:Middlewich Population.svg|right|thumb|400px|Increase in the Population of Middlewich over the last 200 years]]\n\nThe figure to the right shows how the population of Middlewich rose through the 19th and 20th centuries.

The object of interest is log [[Failure rate|hazard function]] between ages 0 and 100 years. The first mode of variation suggests that the variation of female mortality is smaller for ages around 0 or 100, and larger for ages around 25. An appropriate and intuitive interpretation is that mortality around 25 is driven by accidental death, while around 0 or 100, mortality is related to congenital disease or natural death. \n\nCompared to female mortality data, modes of variation of male mortality data shows a higher mortality after around age 20, possibly related to the fact that life expectancy for women is higher than that for men. \n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

The first mode of variation suggests that the variation of female mortality is smaller for ages around 0 or 100, and larger for ages around 25. An appropriate and intuitive interpretation is that mortality around 25 is driven by accidental death, while around 0 or 100, mortality is related to congenital disease or natural death. \n\nCompared to female mortality data, modes of variation of male mortality data shows a higher mortality after around age 20, possibly related to the fact that life expectancy for women is higher than that for men. \n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

In 1650, it was incorporated as a town under its original Native American name, [[Mattabeseck]]. It received its present name in 1653. Middletown was included within [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]] upon its creation on May 10, 1666. In 1784, the central settlement was incorporated as a city distinct from the town. Both were included within newly formed Middlesex County in May 1785. In 1923, the City of Middletown was consolidated with the Town, making the city limits extensive.\n\nOriginally a busy sailing port and then an industrial center, it is now largely residential with its downtown\u2014mainly Main Street\u2014serving as a popular retail, dining, and bar district somewhat close to [[Wesleyan University]]. Middletown was the county seat of [[Middlesex County, Connecticut|Middlesex County]] from its creation in 1785 until the elimination of county government in 1960. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 47,648. Middletown, Connecticut is considered the southernmost city in the [[Hartford-Springfield]] [[Knowledge Corridor]] Metropolitan Region, which features a combined metro population of 1.9 million.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Middletown, Connecticut}}\n\nThe land on the western bank of the Connecticut River where Middletown now lies was home to the Mattabesett [[Native Americans (United States)|Native Americans]] (also spelled ''Mattabesec,'' ''Mattabeseck,'' and ''Mattabesek''); the area they inhabited\u2014now Middletown and the surrounding area\u2014was named after them. At the time the first European settlers arrived in the region, the [[Mattabesetts]] were a part of the group of tribes in the Connecticut Valley, under a single chief named [[Sowheag]].<ref name=\"W1\">Warner,  Elizabeth.

On September 11, 1651, the General Court of Connecticut established the town of \"Mattabesett\". A couple of years later in November 1653, the settlement was renamed Middletown. It was chosen because the site was approximate halfway between Windsor and [[Saybrook, Connecticut|Saybrook]] on the Great River. Life was not easy among these early colonial [[Puritans]]; clearing the land and building homes, and tending farms in the rocky soil of New England was a labor-intensive ordeal. Law, too, was often harsh among the Puritans; offenses legally punishable by death in the Connecticut colonies included, \"witchcraft, blasphemy, cursing or smiting of parents, and incorrigible stubbornness of children.\"<ref name=\"W1\"/><ref name=\"W\"/>\n\n[[Pequot]] [[Mohegans]], at that time traditional allies of the English colonists and enemies of the Mattabesett and other local tribes, arrived in the Middletown area in the latter half of the 17th century; conflict between them and local Native American tribes ensued. The Mattabesett and other tribes referred to the Mohegan as \"destroyers of men.\" Sowheag hoped that the colonists would intervene. They did not. Smallpox, too, afflicted the Mattabesett, significantly lessening their ability to resist and their cohesion as a tribe. Records show that, over time, Sowheag was forced to sell off most of the Mattabesett property to the local colonists; by 1676 the Puritans owned all but {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of the former Mattabesett territory.<ref name=\"W\"/> Similar milieus of tragic interaction between Native Americans and colonists were common in 17th century [[New England]].<ref>Cronin, William. Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England. 2003, Hill and Wang, New York.</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century, Middletown became the largest and most prosperous settlement in Connecticut. By the time of the [[American Revolution]], Middletown was a thriving port with one-third of its citizens involved in merchant and maritime activities. Slavery was part of the early economy of Middletown; [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]] were brought to the town in 1661 from [[Barbados]]; by 1756 Middletown had the third largest African slave population in the state of Connecticut\u2014218 slaves to 5,446 whites.<ref name=\"W\"/>\n\nMiddletown merchant traders pushed for the clearance of the Saybrook Bar at the mouth of the Connecticut River, and later sought the creation of Middlesex County in 1785. The name 'Middlesex' was chosen because the intention was to make Middletown the head of a long river port, much as London was at the head of its long river port in Middlesex County, England. The same persons also established the Middlesex Turnpike (now [[Route 154 (Connecticut)|Route 154]]) to link all the settlements on the western side of the Connecticut, again with the intent of creating one long port.\n\nThe port's decline began in the early 19th century with strained American-British relations and resulting trade restrictions, which led to the [[War of 1812]]. The port never recovered; however, the city distinguished itself in the war effort, as Middletown's Commodore [[Thomas Macdonough]] led American forces to the victory on Lake Champlain in 1814 which ended British hopes for an invasion of New York.\n\nDuring this period, Middletown became a major center for firearms manufacturing. Numerous gun manufacturers in the area supplied the majority of [[pistol]]s to the United States government during the War of 1812. After that war, however, the center of this business passed to [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], Massachusetts, [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], Connecticut, and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], Connecticut. (See also [[Connecticut#History of Connecticut industry|History of Connecticut industry]].)\n\n1831 saw the establishment of [[Wesleyan University]] which was to become one of the United States' leading [[liberal arts college|liberal arts institutions]]. The institution replaced an earlier institution on the same site, Partridge's American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy, which had moved to [[Norwich, Vermont]] and later became [[Norwich University]]. The two main buildings of the original campus were built by the people of Middletown with the intent of attracting an academic institution to the city. In 1841, Middletown established the state's first public high school, which at first enrolled all students from age nine through age sixteen who had previous attended district schools.<ref>Clifford J. Dudley (1981), [http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1981/cthistory/81.ch.02.x.html The History of Public Education in Connecticut], Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, Curriculum Unit 81.ch.02</ref>\n\n[[File:PostcardMiddletownCTGovWeeksHome12Nov1909.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Home of Governor Frank Weeks, decorated for \"Wesleyan Taft Day\", 1909]]\n\nThe mid-19th century also saw manufacturing replace trade as Middletown's economic mainstay; however, industrial growth was limited by railroad operators' decision to bypass Middletown when tracks were laid between Hartford and New Haven. There had been an ambitious plan to build a railroad [[suspension bridge]] in the White Rock, Middletown to Bodkin Rock, Portland vicinity, which was seen as an unpractical solution.\n[[File:PostcardMiddletownCTMainStNorthfrCHall1912.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Main Street, looking north from City Hall, about 1912]]\nMiddletonians played an active role in the Civil War. General [[Joseph K. Mansfield]] was a Union General at Antietam, where he died in action in 1862. Another casualty at Antietam was Brigadier General [[George W. Taylor (general)|George Taylor]], who had been educated at a private military academy in Middletown. Also, the popular Civil War marching song \"[[Marching Through Georgia]]\" was written by [[Henry Clay Work]], a Middletown resident. The city was also active in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] movement, and was a hub along the [[Underground Railroad|underground railway]].\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, manufacturing was the mainstay of the city's economy, especially finely made metal parts, such as marine hardware (Wilcox, Crittendon & Co.) and typewriters (Royal Typewriters). There were also several machine tool & die manufacturers in the city. Middletown was also the site of a major unit of [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]]. In addition, there was the pioneer [[automobile]] manufacturer [[Eisenhuth Horseless Vehicle Company]].<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.51.</ref>\n\nMiddletown also briefly was the home of a major-league baseball team, the [[Middletown Mansfields]] of the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]].\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the once predominantly Anglo-Saxon city underwent a demographic transformation. First the Irish, and then large numbers of Italian immigrants arrived to work in Middletown's factories and farms, many coming from the town of [[Melilli]], [[Sicily]].<ref name=\"melilli_middletown\">{{Cite news|url=http://palermo.repubblica.it/dettaglio/melilli-fiato-sospeso-per-i-compaesani-emigrati-si-attende-la-lista-dei-feriti-di-middletown/1853340 |publisher=La Repubblica Palermo |language=Italian |accessdate=February 8, 2010 |date=February 8, 2010 |title=Melilli, fiato sospeso per gli emigrati si attende la lista dei feriti di Middletown}}</ref> Polish and German arrivals followed, and by 1910 the population had swelled to nearly 21,000. Meanwhile, the number of African-Americans dwindled to a mere 53 persons, as employers chose to hire white immigrants. Later in the century, more African-Americans migrated to the area, followed by a more recent influx of Hispanic residents. The efforts of two Wesleyan professors also brought a small group of Cambodian refugees to Middletown in the early 1980s, who became the basis of a thriving Cambodian community, and a similar story is true for Middletown's small Tibetan community. Middletown is also the home of the first Hindu temple in Connecticut, and has attracted a Hindu population as well.\n\nThis mix of people has also become evident in the range of restaurants which Middletown now has, and which is quickly becoming one of the most well-known aspects of the city.\n\n[[File:PostcardMiddletownCTBroadStFromWashingtonStLookingSouth.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Looking South on Broad Street from Washington Street, 1910 postcard]]\n\nBoth natural events and a continuing influx of people and businesses impacted the city in the first half of the 20th century. Middletown was hit by floods in 1927 and 1936, and by [[New England Hurricane of 1938|''The Great New England Hurricane'']] in 1938. Despite these occurrences, the [[Arrigoni Bridge]] was completed over the Connecticut River in 1938, which connects Middletown to [[Portland, Connecticut|Portland]] and points east, replacing an earlier bridge.\n\nDuring the 1950s, as the popularity of the automobile increased, government officials approved the construction of a highway that effectively separated Middletown from the Connecticut River, its initial, natural ''raison d'\u00eatre''. Highway construction demolished historic neighborhoods, including many buildings from the 18th century, and led people to commute to newer housing outside older neighborhoods. The loss of industry and jobs contributed to a decline in Middletown, like many other northeastern U.S. cities at the time, that did not reverse until the 1990s.\n\nDuring this time, many handsome (albeit decrepit) buildings were torn down in the name of '[[urban renewal]]', and later turned into parking lots, or left empty. Crime increased. During the 1960s, [[Pratt and Whitney|Pratt and Whitney Aircraft]] opened a large plant in the Maromas section of Middletown. Concurrently, developers bought much of the city's remaining farms, including most of Oak Grove Dairy, to create suburban developments for local workers and commuters to surrounding cities.\n\nDuring the 1970s, [[Oddfellows Playhouse]] was established. The theater attracts hundreds of young people every year from around the state to perform in plays and other performances. The playhouse is one of the few youth theaters in the state of [[Connecticut]]. It is located on 128 Washington Street, right around the corner from Middletown's famous Main Street.\n\nDuring the 1990s, a partnership between the city, the Middlesex Chamber of Commerce, and Wesleyan University invested heavily in Middletown's Main Street. Their actions helped the revival of downtown Middletown. Crime decreased, and new restaurants and shops opened.\n\nThe [[Samuel Wadsworth Russell House]] on High Street, built in 1827, was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2001. The [[Richard Alsop IV House|Alsop House]], also located on High Street, and built in 1840, was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2009. Both buildings are part of the Wesleyan campus.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Higbymountain.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Higby Mountain]] Middletown sits on the west bank of the Connecticut River, in the south-central portion of the state. Running alongside the river, [[Route 9 (Connecticut)|Route 9]] bisects the city. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 42.3&nbsp;square miles (109.6&nbsp;km\u00b2), of which, 40.9&nbsp;square miles (105.9&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it is land and 1.4&nbsp;square miles (3.7&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it is water. The total area is 3.36% water. Middletown shares borders with the neighboring towns of [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]], [[Portland, Connecticut|Portland]], [[East Hampton, Connecticut|East Hampton]], [[Haddam, Connecticut|Haddam]], [[Durham, Connecticut|Durham]], [[Middlefield, Connecticut|Middlefield]], [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]], and [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]]. Of all the neighboring towns, Portland and East Hampton are the only ones that do not have any land boundaries, as they are located on the Eastern side of the Connecticut River.\n\nThe west side of Middletown is flanked by the [[Metacomet Ridge]]\u2014a mountainous [[trap rock]] ridgeline that stretches from [[Long Island Sound]] to nearly the [[Vermont]] border. Notable mountains of the Metacomet Ridge in Middletown include [[Higby Mountain]] and the north side of [[Lamentation Mountain]]. The {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Mattabesett Trail]] traverses the ridge. [[The Nature Conservancy]] manages the summit and ledges of Higby Mountain.\n\n===Principal Communities===\n* Highland - The westernmost neighborhood of Middletown. It is the only section of the city that Interstate 91 passes through within its total distance through Middletown.\n* Westfield - A mostly-residential neighborhood located in the northwest corner of the city, lying just south of the border with Cromwell.\n* Miramichi - A mostly-residential neighborhood located in the southwest corner of the city, lying just north of the border with Middlefield.\n* Newfield Heights - A commercial-neighborhood with many businesses and restaurants located just to the north of the city center.\n* Bretton Heights - A mostly-residential neighborhood located a few miles west from the city center.\n* Lakeridge Heights - A semi-industrial neighborhood located just below the South Farms area, and just above the Durham town-line.\n* South Farms - A mostly-residential area lying just to the south of the city center.\n* Maromas - A largely industrial and mostly-uninhabited neighborhood located in the southeastern most part of the city. [[Pratt & Whitney]] has one of its offices located in this area.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1810= 2014\n|1820= 2618\n|1840= 3511\n|1850= 4211\n|1860= 5182\n|1870= 6923\n|1880= 6826\n|1890= 9013\n|1900= 9589\n|1910= 11851\n|1920= 13638\n|1930= 24554\n|1940= 26495\n|1950= 29711\n|1960= 33250\n|1970= 36924\n|1980= 39040\n|1990= 42762\n|2000= 43167\n|2010= 47648\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=46146\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n{{See also|List of Connecticut locations by per capita income}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 12, 2020|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 31, 2008|title=American FactFinder}}</ref> of 2000, there were 43,167 people, 18,554 households, and 10,390 families residing in the city.

These efforts date at least from 1931, when the city was one of the first in America to establish a planning board. Progress continued under the leadership of Democratic mayor, [[Domenique S. Thornton]], who served a record eight years (four terms) as mayor. The city attracted a 12-screen movie theater and numerous restaurants and other businesses to the downtown area, the city provided free [[wi-fi]] service along Main Street and the historic Inn at Middletown a luxury four and half star boutique hotel transformed the former vacant National Guard Armory. On November 8, 2005, Republican [[Sebastian Giuliano]] won the mayor's office, replacing Thornton, whom he criticized for raising taxes and for the awarding of a contract for the construction of a new high school to [[Tomasso Group|Tomasso Brothers, Inc.]], a firm that had been the target of a federal corruption probe. During Giuliano's three terms in office, Middletown's Main Street became a hub for small businesses, and the city began investing heavily in the arts. Democrat Daniel T. Drew defeated Giuliano in 2011. Drew has pushed for increased development in the city's North End, an area that has been plagued by poverty and crime in recent decades. In November 2012, voters approved a $37 Million initiative to move Middletown's wastewater to the Mattabassett Sewer District treatment plant in nearby [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]]. Previously, the city had operated its own sewage treatment plant on the banks of the [[Connecticut River]]. The city has made plans to tear down this older plant and develop the riverfront property on which it sits. Middletown continues to support manufacturing and small business.\n\nMiddletown has remained an important government administrative center. From the creation of Middlesex County in 1798 until the elimination of county government in 1965 Middletown was the county seat. Middletown today retains Middlesex Superior Court, and the Judicial District remains that of the former county court. Other county functions were either centralized to the state or transferred to the towns. The former county building has been removed, but there are other state agency buildings elsewhere in the city, such as the Dept. of Social Services on Main Street Ext. Middletown's Probate Court district includes the towns of Cromwell, Portland, Middlefield and Haddam. The city is also the site of the controversial State Juvenile Training Center.\n\n[[File:Middletown, CT - Arrigoni Building 01.jpg|thumb|Arrigoni Building (former Arrigoni Hotel, now low-income housing) and others in Middletown's North End]]\nCulturally and politically, Middletown is in the midst of an effort to revitalize its historically disadvantaged North End. Economic development projects recently completed in the North End include Wharfside Commons, a 96-unit mixed income apartment block, and the new Community Health Center (completed in 2012 at the corner of Main and Grand Streets<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.courant.com/community/middletown/hc-middletown-community-health-center-0404-20170501-story.html|title=Health Care Center In Middletown Expands|last=BEALS|first=SHAWN R.|work=Courant Community|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en-US}}</ref>). The [[Green Street Arts Center]], founded by Wesleyan and a coalition of community groups in 2000, is a pioneering attempt to attract residents and businesses to the neighborhood by promoting arts education and outreach. For decades, the famous [[O'Rourke's Diner]] has done much to bring some stability to the North End. A fire on August 31, 2006, gutted much of the historic structure. The Middletown community held many fundraising events to raise money for the diner's rebuilding. Reconstruction began in September 2007, and [[O'Rourke's Diner]] re-opened in February 2008. [[Daniel Drew (politician)|Mayor Daniel Drew]] (2011-2019) supported citizen-oriented efforts to revitalize the North End, such as the local nonprofit NEAT (North End Action Team). In 2012, the City of Middletown and NEAT partnered to form the \"I Heart the North End\" initiative, which plans to raise public awareness of the economic and cultural opportunities available in the area.\n\n[[File:Oddfellows Playhouse, Middletown, Connecticut 01.jpg|thumb|left|Oddfellows Playhouse]]\nMiddletown is the only location of a well-known youth theater group, [[Oddfellows Playhouse]], which is located on Washington Street and pulls in children of all ages from all over the state to learn theater skills.

In 1650, it was incorporated as a town under its original Native American name, [[Mattabeseck]]. It received its present name in 1653. Middletown was included within [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]] upon its creation on May 10, 1666. In 1784, the central settlement was incorporated as a city distinct from the town. Both were included within newly formed Middlesex County in May 1785. In 1923, the City of Middletown was consolidated with the Town, making the city limits extensive.\n\nOriginally a busy sailing port and then an industrial center, it is now largely residential with its downtown\u2014mainly Main Street\u2014serving as a popular retail, dining, and bar district somewhat close to [[Wesleyan University]]. Middletown was the county seat of [[Middlesex County, Connecticut|Middlesex County]] from its creation in 1785 until the elimination of county government in 1960. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 47,648. Middletown, Connecticut is considered the southernmost city in the [[Hartford-Springfield]] [[Knowledge Corridor]] Metropolitan Region, which features a combined metro population of 1.9 million.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Middletown, Connecticut}}\n\nThe land on the western bank of the Connecticut River where Middletown now lies was home to the Mattabesett [[Native Americans (United States)|Native Americans]] (also spelled ''Mattabesec,'' ''Mattabeseck,'' and ''Mattabesek''); the area they inhabited\u2014now Middletown and the surrounding area\u2014was named after them. At the time the first European settlers arrived in the region, the [[Mattabesetts]] were a part of the group of tribes in the Connecticut Valley, under a single chief named [[Sowheag]].<ref name=\"W1\">Warner,  Elizabeth.

On September 11, 1651, the General Court of Connecticut established the town of \"Mattabesett\". A couple of years later in November of 1653, the settlement was renamed Middletown. It was chosen because the site was approximate halfway between Windsor and [[Saybrook, Connecticut|Saybrook]] on the Great River. Life was not easy among these early colonial [[Puritans]]; clearing the land and building homes, and tending farms in the rocky soil of New England was a labor-intensive ordeal. Law, too, was often harsh among the Puritans; offenses legally punishable by death in the Connecticut colonies included, \"witchcraft, blasphemy, cursing or smiting of parents, and incorrigible stubbornness of children.\"<ref name=\"W1\"/><ref name=\"W\"/>\n\n[[Pequot]] [[Mohegans]], at that time traditional allies of the English colonists and enemies of the Mattabesett and other local tribes, arrived in the Middletown area in the latter half of the 17th century; conflict between them and local Native American tribes ensued. The Mattabesett and other tribes referred to the Mohegan as \"destroyers of men.\" Sowheag hoped that the colonists would intervene. They did not. Smallpox, too, afflicted the Mattabesett, significantly lessening their ability to resist and their cohesion as a tribe. Records show that, over time, Sowheag was forced to sell off most of the Mattabesett property to the local colonists; by 1676 the Puritans owned all but {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of the former Mattabesett territory.<ref name=\"W\"/> Similar milieus of tragic interaction between Native Americans and colonists were common in 17th century [[New England]].<ref>Cronin, William. Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England. 2003, Hill and Wang, New York.</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century, Middletown became the largest and most prosperous settlement in Connecticut. By the time of the [[American Revolution]], Middletown was a thriving port with one-third of its citizens involved in merchant and maritime activities. Slavery was part of the early economy of Middletown; [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]] were brought to the town in 1661 from [[Barbados]]; by 1756 Middletown had the third largest African slave population in the state of Connecticut\u2014218 slaves to 5,446 whites.<ref name=\"W\"/>\n\nMiddletown merchant traders pushed for the clearance of the Saybrook Bar at the mouth of the Connecticut River, and later sought the creation of Middlesex County in 1785. The name 'Middlesex' was chosen because the intention was to make Middletown the head of a long river port, much as London was at the head of its long river port in Middlesex County, England. The same persons also established the Middlesex Turnpike (now [[Route 154 (Connecticut)|Route 154]]) to link all the settlements on the western side of the Connecticut, again with the intent of creating one long port.\n\nThe port's decline began in the early 19th century with strained American-British relations and resulting trade restrictions, which led to the [[War of 1812]]. The port never recovered; however, the city distinguished itself in the war effort, as Middletown's Commodore [[Thomas Macdonough]] led American forces to the victory on Lake Champlain in 1814 which ended British hopes for an invasion of New York.\n\nDuring this period, Middletown became a major center for firearms manufacturing. Numerous gun manufacturers in the area supplied the majority of [[pistol]]s to the United States government during the War of 1812. After that war, however, the center of this business passed to [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], Massachusetts, [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], Connecticut, and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], Connecticut. (See also [[Connecticut#History of Connecticut industry|History of Connecticut industry]].)\n\n1831 saw the establishment of [[Wesleyan University]] which was to become one of the United States' leading [[liberal arts college|liberal arts institutions]]. The institution replaced an earlier institution on the same site, Partridge's American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy, which had moved to [[Norwich, Vermont]] and later became [[Norwich University]]. The two main buildings of the original campus were built by the people of Middletown with the intent of attracting an academic institution to the city. In 1841, Middletown established the state's first public high school, which at first enrolled all students from age nine through age sixteen who had previous attended district schools.<ref>Clifford J. Dudley (1981), [http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1981/cthistory/81.ch.02.x.html The History of Public Education in Connecticut], Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, Curriculum Unit 81.ch.02</ref>\n\n[[File:PostcardMiddletownCTGovWeeksHome12Nov1909.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Home of Governor Frank Weeks, decorated for \"Wesleyan Taft Day\", 1909]]\n\nThe mid-19th century also saw manufacturing replace trade as Middletown's economic mainstay; however, industrial growth was limited by railroad operators' decision to bypass Middletown when tracks were laid between Hartford and New Haven. There had been an ambitious plan to build a railroad [[suspension bridge]] in the White Rock, Middletown to Bodkin Rock, Portland vicinity, which was seen as an unpractical solution.\n[[File:PostcardMiddletownCTMainStNorthfrCHall1912.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Main Street, looking north from City Hall, about 1912]]\nMiddletonians played an active role in the Civil War. General [[Joseph K. Mansfield]] was a Union General at Antietam, where he died in action in 1862. Another casualty at Antietam was Brigadier General [[George W. Taylor (general)|George Taylor]], who had been educated at a private military academy in Middletown. Also, the popular Civil War marching song \"[[Marching Through Georgia]]\" was written by [[Henry Clay Work]], a Middletown resident. The city was also active in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] movement, and was a hub along the [[Underground Railroad|underground railway]].\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, manufacturing was the mainstay of the city's economy, especially finely made metal parts, such as marine hardware (Wilcox, Crittendon & Co.) and typewriters (Royal Typewriters). There were also several machine tool & die manufacturers in the city. Middletown was also the site of a major unit of [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]]. In addition, there was the pioneer [[automobile]] manufacturer [[Eisenhuth Horseless Vehicle Company]].<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.51.</ref>\n\nMiddletown also briefly was the home of a major-league baseball team, the [[Middletown Mansfields]] of the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]].\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the once predominantly Anglo-Saxon city underwent a demographic transformation. First the Irish, and then large numbers of Italian immigrants arrived to work in Middletown's factories and farms, many coming from the town of [[Melilli]], [[Sicily]].<ref name=\"melilli_middletown\">{{Cite news|url=http://palermo.repubblica.it/dettaglio/melilli-fiato-sospeso-per-i-compaesani-emigrati-si-attende-la-lista-dei-feriti-di-middletown/1853340 |publisher=La Repubblica Palermo |language=Italian |accessdate=February 8, 2010 |date=February 8, 2010 |title=Melilli, fiato sospeso per gli emigrati si attende la lista dei feriti di Middletown}}</ref> Polish and German arrivals followed, and by 1910 the population had swelled to nearly 21,000. Meanwhile, the number of African-Americans dwindled to a mere 53 persons, as employers chose to hire white immigrants. Later in the century, more African-Americans migrated to the area, followed by a more recent influx of Hispanic residents. The efforts of two Wesleyan professors also brought a small group of Cambodian refugees to Middletown in the early 1980s, who became the basis of a thriving Cambodian community, and a similar story is true for Middletown's small Tibetan community. Middletown is also the home of the first Hindu temple in Connecticut, and has attracted a Hindu population as well.\n\nThis mix of people has also become evident in the range of restaurants which Middletown now has, and which is quickly becoming one of the most well-known aspects of the city.\n\n[[File:PostcardMiddletownCTBroadStFromWashingtonStLookingSouth.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Looking South on Broad Street from Washington Street, 1910 postcard]]\n\nBoth natural events and a continuing influx of people and businesses impacted the city in the first half of the 20th century. Middletown was hit by floods in 1927 and 1936, and by [[New England Hurricane of 1938|''The Great New England Hurricane'']] in 1938. Despite these occurrences, the [[Arrigoni Bridge]] was completed over the Connecticut River in 1938, which connects Middletown to [[Portland, Connecticut|Portland]] and points east, replacing an earlier bridge.\n\nDuring the 1950s, as the popularity of the automobile increased, government officials approved the construction of a highway that effectively separated Middletown from the Connecticut River, its initial, natural ''raison d'\u00eatre''. Highway construction demolished historic neighborhoods, including many buildings from the 18th century, and led people to commute to newer housing outside older neighborhoods. The loss of industry and jobs contributed to a decline in Middletown, like many other northeastern U.S. cities at the time, that did not reverse until the 1990s.\n\nDuring this time, many handsome (albeit decrepit) buildings were torn down in the name of '[[urban renewal]]', and later turned into parking lots, or left empty. Crime increased. During the 1960s, [[Pratt and Whitney|Pratt and Whitney Aircraft]] opened a large plant in the Maromas section of Middletown. Concurrently, developers bought much of the city's remaining farms, including most of Oak Grove Dairy, to create suburban developments for local workers and commuters to surrounding cities.\n\nDuring the 1970s, [[Oddfellows Playhouse]] was established. The theater attracts hundreds of young people every year from around the state to perform in plays and other performances. The playhouse is one of the few youth theaters in the state of [[Connecticut]]. It is located on 128 Washington Street, right around the corner from Middletown's famous Main Street.\n\nDuring the 1990s, a partnership between the city, the Middlesex Chamber of Commerce, and Wesleyan University invested heavily in Middletown's Main Street. Their actions helped the revival of downtown Middletown. Crime decreased, and new restaurants and shops opened.\n\nThe [[Samuel Wadsworth Russell House]] on High Street, built in 1827, was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2001. The [[Richard Alsop IV House|Alsop House]], also located on High Street, and built in 1840, was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2009. Both buildings are part of the Wesleyan campus.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Higbymountain.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Higby Mountain]] Middletown sits on the west bank of the Connecticut River, in the south-central portion of the state. Running alongside the river, [[Route 9 (Connecticut)|Route 9]] bisects the city. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 42.3&nbsp;square miles (109.6&nbsp;km\u00b2), of which, 40.9&nbsp;square miles (105.9&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it is land and 1.4&nbsp;square miles (3.7&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it is water. The total area is 3.36% water. Middletown shares borders with the neighboring towns of [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]], [[Portland, Connecticut|Portland]], [[East Hampton, Connecticut|East Hampton]], [[Haddam, Connecticut|Haddam]], [[Durham, Connecticut|Durham]], [[Middlefield, Connecticut|Middlefield]], [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]], and [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]]. Of all the neighboring towns, Portland and East Hampton are the only ones that do not have any land boundaries, as they are located on the Eastern side of the Connecticut River.\n\nThe west side of Middletown is flanked by the [[Metacomet Ridge]]\u2014a mountainous [[trap rock]] ridgeline that stretches from [[Long Island Sound]] to nearly the [[Vermont]] border. Notable mountains of the Metacomet Ridge in Middletown include [[Higby Mountain]] and the north side of [[Lamentation Mountain]]. The {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Mattabesett Trail]] traverses the ridge. [[The Nature Conservancy]] manages the summit and ledges of Higby Mountain.\n\n===Principal Communities===\n* Highland - The westernmost neighborhood of Middletown. It is the only section of the city that Interstate 91 passes through within its total distance through Middletown.\n* Westfield - A mostly-residential neighborhood located in the northwest corner of the city, lying just south of the border with Cromwell.\n* Miramichi - A mostly-residential neighborhood located in the southwest corner of the city, lying just north of the border with Middlefield.\n* Newfield Heights - A commercial-neighborhood with many businesses and restaurants located just to the north of the city center.\n* Bretton Heights - A mostly-residential neighborhood located a few miles west from the city center.\n* Lakeridge Heights - A semi-industrial neighborhood located just below the South Farms area, and just above the Durham town-line.\n* South Farms - A mostly-residential area lying just to the south of the city center.\n* Maromas - A largely industrial and mostly-uninhabited neighborhood located in the southeastern most part of the city. [[Pratt & Whitney]] has one of its offices located in this area.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1810= 2014\n|1820= 2618\n|1840= 3511\n|1850= 4211\n|1860= 5182\n|1870= 6923\n|1880= 6826\n|1890= 9013\n|1900= 9589\n|1910= 11851\n|1920= 13638\n|1930= 24554\n|1940= 26495\n|1950= 29711\n|1960= 33250\n|1970= 36924\n|1980= 39040\n|1990= 42762\n|2000= 43167\n|2010= 47648\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=46146\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n{{See also|List of Connecticut locations by per capita income}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 12, 2020|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 31, 2008|title=American FactFinder}}</ref> of 2000, there were 43,167 people, 18,554 households, and 10,390 families residing in the city.

These efforts date at least from 1931, when the city was one of the first in America to establish a planning board. Progress continued under the leadership of Democratic mayor, [[Domenique S. Thornton]], who served a record eight years (four terms) as mayor. The city attracted a 12-screen movie theater and numerous restaurants and other businesses to the downtown area, the city provided free [[wi-fi]] service along Main Street and the historic Inn at Middletown a luxury four and half star boutique hotel transformed the former vacant National Guard Armory. On November 8, 2005, Republican [[Sebastian Giuliano]] won the mayor's office, replacing Thornton, whom he criticized for raising taxes and for the awarding of a contract for the construction of a new high school to [[Tomasso Group|Tomasso Brothers, Inc.]], a firm that had been the target of a federal corruption probe. During Giuliano's three terms in office, Middletown's Main Street became a hub for small businesses, and the city began investing heavily in the arts. Democrat Daniel T. Drew defeated Giuliano in 2011. Drew has pushed for increased development in the city's North End, an area that has been plagued by poverty and crime in recent decades. In November 2012, voters approved a $37 Million initiative to move Middletown's wastewater to the Mattabassett Sewer District treatment plant in nearby [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]]. Previously, the city had operated its own sewage treatment plant on the banks of the [[Connecticut River]]. The city has made plans to tear down this older plant and develop the riverfront property on which it sits. Middletown continues to support manufacturing and small business.\n\nMiddletown has remained an important government administrative center. From the creation of Middlesex County in 1798 until the elimination of county government in 1965 Middletown was the county seat. Middletown today retains Middlesex Superior Court, and the Judicial District remains that of the former county court. Other county functions were either centralized to the state or transferred to the towns. The former county building has been removed, but there are other state agency buildings elsewhere in the city, such as the Dept. of Social Services on Main Street Ext. Middletown's Probate Court district includes the towns of Cromwell, Portland, Middlefield and Haddam. The city is also the site of the controversial State Juvenile Training Center.\n\n[[File:Middletown, CT - Arrigoni Building 01.jpg|thumb|Arrigoni Building (former Arrigoni Hotel, now low-income housing) and others in Middletown's North End]]\nCulturally and politically, Middletown is in the midst of an effort to revitalize its historically disadvantaged North End. Economic development projects recently completed in the North End include Wharfside Commons, a 96-unit mixed income apartment block, and the new Community Health Center (completed in 2012 at the corner of Main and Grand Streets<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.courant.com/community/middletown/hc-middletown-community-health-center-0404-20170501-story.html|title=Health Care Center In Middletown Expands|last=BEALS|first=SHAWN R.|work=Courant Community|access-date=2017-10-09|language=en-US}}</ref>). The [[Green Street Arts Center]], founded by Wesleyan and a coalition of community groups in 2000, is a pioneering attempt to attract residents and businesses to the neighborhood by promoting arts education and outreach. For decades, the famous [[O'Rourke's Diner]] has done much to bring some stability to the North End. A fire on August 31, 2006, gutted much of the historic structure. The Middletown community held many fundraising events to raise money for the diner's rebuilding. Reconstruction began in September 2007, and [[O'Rourke's Diner]] re-opened in February 2008. [[Daniel Drew (politician)|Mayor Daniel Drew]] (2011-2019) supported citizen-oriented efforts to revitalize the North End, such as the local nonprofit NEAT (North End Action Team). In 2012, the City of Middletown and NEAT partnered to form the \"I Heart the North End\" initiative, which plans to raise public awareness of the economic and cultural opportunities available in the area.\n\n[[File:Oddfellows Playhouse, Middletown, Connecticut 01.jpg|thumb|left|Oddfellows Playhouse]]\nMiddletown is the only location of a well-known youth theater group, [[Oddfellows Playhouse]], which is located on Washington Street and pulls in children of all ages from all over the state to learn theater skills.
