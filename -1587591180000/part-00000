{"title_page": "That's Too Much, Man! (BoJack Horseman)", "text_new": "==Plot==\n\nSarah Lynn is shown to have a more calm and positive life ever since veering down the path of sobriety. She is about to hit her nine-month sober milestone and get her nine-month chip when BoJack calls her and asks her if she wants to party. She immediately accepts and downs a bottle of vodka. With the abundance of drugs and alcohol, they then proceed to drink and do drugs, as they reminisce and watch old episodes of Horsin' Around. However, BoJack begins to experience blackouts. After a few blackouts, in which Sarah Lynn asks to go to the planetarium twice, only for BoJack to reject the idea. They end up at an AA meeting because Sarah Lynn wants to get her nine-month sobriety chip. He has another blackout and comes to driving a car recklessly. Sarah Lynn tells him that he shut down the AA meeting, because he bummed everyone out.\n\nSarah Lynn also tells him, to try the twelve-step program, and to make amends to make himself feel better and get a clean slate. BoJack decides to go around and make amends to people. His first stop is Diane Nguyen and Mr. Peanutbutter's house. They break in and raid their fridge while waiting for them to come home. While they're doing this, the real Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter get home. They offer to let the two of them sleep it off in their guest bedroom but in their high state, BoJack and Sarah Lynn then run off. As they do, they shove into Diane and break her wrist again. BoJack then tries to make amends to Todd, although he ends up mistakenly apologizing to a little boy, who resembles Todd.\n\nBoJack next visits Ana Spanakopita. He asks her why she left and why she won't give them a chance to be broken together. She begins to tell him a story about why they can't work as a couple, but BoJack has another blackout. He makes Sarah Lynn drive back two more times, so that he can hear the story again, but continues to blackout. Finally, he goes to Princess Carolyn's apartment building, and tries to make amends by standing outside her apartment building on the roof of his car and screaming that he's sorry. Princess Carolyn just sighs and goes back inside with her boyfriend Ralph Stilton. BoJack returns to Ana's once again to hear her story. He apologizes for bothering her so much that night, and Ana informs him she hasn't seen him in two weeks.\n\nShe tells him her lifeguard story again\u2014after her near-death experiences a teen, where she drives her car into a lake and almost drowned. She became a lifeguard so that she would never be weaker than water. On her first day of training, her instructor told her that there will be times she will see someone in trouble, and she'll want to rush in and do anything she can to help them\u2014but she must stop herself because there are people you can't save. Those people will thrash and struggle, and try to take you down with them. BoJack doesn't get what that whole story has to do with him.\n\nBoJack has another blackout, and wakes up in the car, driving to Ohio to make amends with Penny; and to see if he messed up her life. He demands Sarah Lynn to turn the car around, but they end up at her school library. They spot Penny using the computer and BoJack says that they should stop following her, although he blacks out again and it's now later at night, outside of a party Penny is attending. BoJack says that she seems fine and that maybe he didn't ruin her. He agrees to leave after he urinates but ends up bumping into a group of guys, thus alerting Penny. She begins to freak out and tells him that he can't be here, she then says \"I was seventeen, I didn\u2019t know any better!\" The people around them start to recognize Sarah Lynn and BoJack and begin to take pictures of them, so they leave as a frightened Penny disappears into the crowd.\n\nBack in the car, Sarah Lynn tells BoJack that Penny was probably doing great before they showed up and that they should've just left her alone; to BoJack's chagrin. On the car ride home, Sarah Lynn finds a pack of heroin nicknamed \"BoJack\" in Bojack's glove compartment. She tells BoJack that they should try it, with the caveat that having a drug named after you is a big deal. He says he doesn't want to shoot heroin. Later, after the two have returned to Sarah Lynn's house, BoJack says him and Sarah Lynn are gonna snort heroin, like sophisticated adults. After he snorts some heroin, BoJack blacks out again. During his blackout, he has a flashback to Thanksgiving 2007, at Cuddlywhiskers's house. Everything in the background is shaking around them. Cuddlywhiskers gets off the phone with the network executives, and they had told him the latest episode of The BoJack Horseman Show, had gotten the lowest ratings yet. He tells BoJack he still believes their show has an audience, and they should try to get a guest star to boost ratings, presumably Sarah Lynn. BoJack is uneasy about this, as she's \u201cthe world's biggest pop star\" and they hadn't spoken since Horsin\u2019 Around ended.\n\nBoJack wakes up. He then has a series of blackouts that transition him and Sarah Lynn to different locations. While this happens, he reminisces on their time together on Horsin' Around, and tells Sarah Lynn he feels like she's the only one who understands him. He elaborates, saying they can be friends because they're the only two people who knew each other before they were famous, and they like each other for who they really are. BoJack continues this speech, as the scene transitions, to the two of them laying on a bed in a hotel. BoJack says they don't want anything from each other, and he tells Sarah Lynn he loves her. She doesn't respond, and he panics, but she is apathetic about this and complains about being bored.\n\nShe turns on the TV and discovers the Oscars are on, to BoJack's surprise as he discovers how long they were actually on the bender. Sarah Lynn states she loves the glitz and glam of the Oscars. Sarah Lynn wins the Oscar for Best Original Song in absentia, which makes her ecstatic, but then regretful as she wasn't there to receive it. She tells BoJack if someone had told her as a kid she'd win an Oscar, she wouldn't have believed it, but now she has, and she cuts herself off. Sarah Lynn tells BoJack she doesn't like anything about herself. She says even her shirt came from a company who paid her $8,000 to wear it, despite her not needing the money, she just likes that someone still cared about her enough to want her to wear their shirt. BoJack tries to comfort her, but Sarah Lynn begins to panic, thinking she and everyone else is doomed. BoJack calms her down and finally agrees to take her to the planetarium.\n\nThe two are then in the planetarium watching a show. Sarah Lynn rests her head on BoJack's shoulder and says \"I wanna be an architect.\" The narrator says, their lives are but short flashes in a universe, that is billions of years old. BoJack tells Sarah Lynn there's nothing to worry about because it doesn't matter what you did in the past or how you'll be remembered, all that matter is this precious moment that they are sharing together. He asks if she agrees, but she doesn't respond. He nudges her and says her name multiple times, but Sarah Lynn doesn't respond, Signaling that she died.\n\n==References==\n\n[1]Ettenhofer, Valerie. \u201c'That's Too Much, Man!'

He elaborates, saying they can be friends because they're the only two people who knew each other before they were famous, and they like each other for who they really are. BoJack continues this speech, as the scene transitions, to the two of them laying on a bed in a hotel. BoJack says they don't want anything from each other, and he tells Sarah Lynn he loves her. She doesn't respond, and he panics, but she is apathetic about this and complains about being bored.\n\nShe turns on the TV and discovers the Oscars are on, to BoJack's surprise as he discovers how long they were actually on the bender. Sarah Lynn states she loves the glitz and glam of the Oscars. Sarah Lynn wins the Oscar for Best Original Song in absentia, which makes her ecstatic, but then regretful as she wasn't there to receive it. She tells BoJack if someone had told her as a kid she'd win an Oscar, she wouldn't have believed it, but now she has, and she cuts herself off. Sarah Lynn tells BoJack she doesn't like anything about herself. She says even her shirt came from a company who paid her $8,000 to wear it, despite her not needing the money, she just likes that someone still cared about her enough to want her to wear their shirt. BoJack tries to comfort her, but Sarah Lynn begins to panic, thinking she and everyone else is doomed. BoJack calms her down and finally agrees to take her to the planetarium.\n\nThe two are then in the planetarium watching a show. Sarah Lynn rests her head on BoJack's shoulder and says \"I wanna be an architect.\" The narrator says, their lives are but short flashes in a universe, that is billions of years old. BoJack tells Sarah Lynn there's nothing to worry about because it doesn't matter what you did in the past or how you'll be remembered, all that matter is this precious moment that they are sharing together. He asks if she agrees, but she doesn't respond. He nudges her and says her name multiple times, but Sarah Lynn doesn't respond, Signaling that she died.\n\n==References==\n\n\nEttenhofer, Valerie. \u201c'That's Too Much, Man!'

A previous incarnation of the conference existed from 1971 to 2013. The majority of its members will be located in the state of [[Michigan]], with additional members in [[Minnesota]] and [[Ohio]]. It has also had teams located in [[Alaska]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Missouri]] and [[Nebraska]] and  over the course of its existence.\n\nThe CCHA was disbanded after the [[2012\u201313 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|2012\u201313 season]] as the result of a conference realignment stemming from the [[Big Ten Conference]] (of which three CCHA schools; Michigan, Michigan State, and Ohio State, were primary members) choosing to sponsor Division I ice hockey beginning in the 2013\u201314 season. The remaining CCHA members received invitations to other conferences, such as the newly formed [[National Collegiate Hockey Conference]] (NCHC), [[Hockey East]], and the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] (WCHA), which itself had been depleted by the Big Ten and NCHC. The conference's last game before its hiatus was the final of the [[2013 CCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]] at [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit]], where Notre Dame beat Michigan 3\u20131 to win the [[Mason Cup]] championship.\n\nOn February 18, 2020, seven schools who had applied to leave the WCHA announced they would form a new CCHA for the 2021\u201322 season. The member schools are Bemidji State, Bowling Green (who had retained the rights to the CCHA name), Ferris State, Lake Superior State, Michigan Tech, Minnesota State and Northern Michigan.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nThe CCHA began in 1971 as an [[NCAA]] conference comprised by [[Bowling Green Falcons men's ice hockey|Bowling Green]], [[Ohio Bobcats men's ice hockey|Ohio]], [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey|Ohio State]] and [[Saint Louis Billikens men's ice hockey|Saint Louis]].<ref>{{Cite web|work=College Hockey Historical Archive |url=https://www.augenblick.org/chha/ccha_his.html |title=History of the CCHA |accessdate=February 19, 2020}}</ref> After adding [[Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey|Lake Superior State]] for year two, both Ohio State and Ohio withdrew from the conference, leaving the CCHA with a scant 3 members. Despite the trouble the three teams rode out the rough patch and the league began to grow with the addition of [[Western Michigan Broncos men's ice hockey|Western Michigan]] and the return of Ohio State.<ref name=media>{{cite news|title=2012-13 CCHA Media Guide|url=http://issuu.com/cchahockey/docs/2012-13_ccha_media_guide_final_2a_compressed#|publisher=ISSUU.com|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===NCAA Acceptance===\nUp until 1976 the NCAA had only offered bids to the tournament from teams in either [[ECAC Hockey]] or the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association|WCHA]]. Because those were the only two [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] conferences for most years there was no controversy but, after the CCHA had proved to be more than just a flash in the pan, the tournament had to change. Beginning with the [[1977 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1977 Championship]] the NCAA allowed itself the freedom  to add up to four additional teams to the tournament with the understanding that the [[CCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|CCHA tournament champion]] would receive one of the additional bids. Bowling Green won the first tournament game for the conference but it wasn't until [[Northern Michigan Wildcats men's ice hockey|Northern Michigan]] reached the championship game in [[1980 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1980]] that the league began to gain acceptance.\n\n===WCHA Defectors===\n1981 saw a major shift in [[college ice hockey]] with four teams from the WCHA defecting to the CCHA. The move was done as a way to reduce travel costs as well as provide the new team with a better chance at making the NCAA Tournament (many of the CCHA teams were still seen as lesser programs). [[Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey|Michigan State]] made the tournament in its first three season of CCHA play but it was founding member Bowling Green that won the conference's first national championship in [[1984 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1984]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Official 2008 NCAA Men's and Women's Ice Hockey Records Book |publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association |location=Indianapolis |pages=54, 58 |issn=1089-0092 |url=https://www.ncaa.org/library/records/ice_hockey/m_w_ice_hockey_records_book/2008/2008_m_w_ice_hockey_records.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-05-23 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===National Prominence===\n[[Bill Beagan]] served as commissioner of the CCHA from 1985 to 1998.<ref name=\"Bacon\">{{cite book|last=Bacon|first=John U.|author-link=John U.

Additionally they vote to award up to 9 of the 12 individual trophies to an eligible player at the same time (depending upon the year). The CCHA also awards a Perani Cup, a Humanitarian Award, which are awarded rather than voted upon, and a Most Valuable Player in Tournament which is voted on at the conclusion of the conference tournament. None of the individual awards conferred by the CCHA have been given for the entire existence of the conference. Only the Tournament MVP was awarded in CCHA's inaugural season, but the award was discontinued thereafter until 1982.<ref>{{cite news|title=CCHA

A previous incarnation of the conference existed from 1971 to 2013. The majority of its members will be located in the state of [[Michigan]], with additional members in [[Minnesota]] and [[Ohio]]. It has also had teams located in [[Alaska]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Missouri]] and [[Nebraska]] and  over the course of its existence.\n\nThe CCHA was disbanded after the [[2012\u201313 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|2012\u201313 season]] as the result of a conference realignment stemming from the [[Big Ten Conference]] (of which three CCHA schools; Michigan, Michigan State, and Ohio State, were primary members) choosing to sponsor Division I ice hockey beginning in the 2013\u201314 season. The remaining CCHA members received invitations to other conferences, such as the newly formed [[National Collegiate Hockey Conference]] (NCHC), [[Hockey East]], and the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] (WCHA), which itself had been depleted by the Big Ten and NCHC. The conference's last game before its hiatus was the final of the [[2013 CCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]] at [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit]], where Notre Dame beat Michigan 3\u20131 to win the [[Mason Cup]] championship.\n\nOn February 18, 2020, seven schools who had applied to leave the WCHA announced they would form a new CCHA for the 2021\u201322 season. The member schools are Bemidji State, Bowling Green (who had retained the rights to the CCHA name), Ferris State, Lake Superior State, Michigan Tech, Minnesota State and Northern Michigan.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nThe CCHA began in 1971 as an [[NCAA]] conference comprised by [[Bowling Green Falcons men's ice hockey|Bowling Green]], [[Ohio Bobcats men's ice hockey|Ohio]], [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey|Ohio State]] and [[Saint Louis Billikens men's ice hockey|Saint Louis]].<ref>{{Cite web|work=College Hockey Historical Archive |url=https://www.augenblick.org/chha/ccha_his.html |title=History of the CCHA |accessdate=February 19, 2020}}</ref> After adding [[Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey|Lake Superior State]] for year two, both Ohio State and Ohio withdrew from the conference, leaving the CCHA with a scant 3 members. Despite the trouble the three teams rode out the rough patch and the league began to grow with the addition of [[Western Michigan Broncos men's ice hockey|Western Michigan]] and the return of Ohio State.<ref name=media>{{cite news|title=2012-13 CCHA Media Guide|url=http://issuu.com/cchahockey/docs/2012-13_ccha_media_guide_final_2a_compressed#|publisher=ISSUU.com|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===NCAA Acceptance===\nUp until 1976 the NCAA had only offered bids to the tournament from teams in either [[ECAC Hockey]] or the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association|WCHA]]. Because those were the only two [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] conferences for most years there was no controversy but, after the CCHA had proved to be more than just a flash in the pan, the tournament had to change. Beginning with the [[1977 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1977 Championship]] the NCAA allowed itself the freedom  to add up to four additional teams to the tournament with the understanding that the [[CCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|CCHA tournament champion]] would receive one of the additional bids. Bowling Green won the first tournament game for the conference but it wasn't until [[Northern Michigan Wildcats men's ice hockey|Northern Michigan]] reached the championship game in [[1980 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1980]] that the league began to gain acceptance.\n\n===WCHA Defectors===\n1981 saw a major shift in [[college ice hockey]] with four teams from the WCHA defecting to the CCHA. The move was done as a way to reduce travel costs as well as provide the new team with a better chance at making the NCAA Tournament (many of the CCHA teams were still seen as lesser programs). [[Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey|Michigan State]] made the tournament in its first three season of CCHA play but it was founding member Bowling Green that won the conference's first national championship in [[1984 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1984]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Official 2008 NCAA Men's and Women's Ice Hockey Records Book |publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association |location=Indianapolis |pages=54, 58 |issn=1089-0092 |url=https://www.ncaa.org/library/records/ice_hockey/m_w_ice_hockey_records_book/2008/2008_m_w_ice_hockey_records.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-05-23 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===National Prominence===\n[[Bill Beagan]] served as commissioner of the CCHA from 1985 to 1998.<ref name=\"Bacon\">{{cite book|last=Bacon|first=John U.|author-link=John U.

Additionally they vote to award up to 9 of the 12 individual trophies to an eligible player at the same time (depending upon the year). The CCHA also awards a Perani Cup, a Humanitarian Award, which are awarded rather than voted upon, and a Most Valuable Player in Tournament which is voted on at the conclusion of the conference tournament. None of the individual awards conferred by the CCHA have been given for the entire existence of the conference. Only the Tournament MVP was awarded in CCHA's inaugural season, but the award was discontinued thereafter until 1982.<ref>{{cite news|title=CCHA

Subsequently, these soldiers, stationed in [[Arlon]], wore the wild boar (emblem of the [[Ardennes]]) on their green berets. One regiment was not enough to hold the east lines, so in August 1934, the regiment was divided into three and a bicycle battalion was added. On 24 March 1937, three regiments were created: 1st, 2nd and 3rd ''R\u00e9giment des Chasseurs Ardennais'' they were located in Arlon, [[Bastogne]] and [[Vielsalm]]. Each unit was structured with one HQ battalion, three battalions to three companies of mixed cyclists (three ''packs'' of riflemen and three packs of MG) one motorcycle company each with each three motorbike squadrons, and one squadron with three [[Belgian combat vehicles of World War II#T15 light tank|T-15 tanks]]; one company with four [[T-13 tank destroyer|T-13 tanks]] armed with 47mm antitank cannons; and finally one medical company. On July 1, 1939, these were formed into a division. Following the [[mobilization]] of the Belgian Army in late 1939 this division comprised 35,000 men, and a second division of three more regiments was created.\n\n===Second World War===\nIn the [[Second World War]], the ''Chasseurs Ardennais'' took part in heavy fighting after Belgium was [[Battle of Belgium|invaded]] on 10 May 1940; the Germans noted the fierce resistance of the Belgians and the ''Chasseurs Ardennais'' were no exception.

He also took on kitchen work, laundry, and cleaning. After eight years at Holy Rosary, the [[prior]] Juan de Lorenzana decided to turn a blind eye to the law and permit Martin to take his vows as a member of the [[Third Order of Saint Dominic]].

By the time he died, on 3 November 1639, he had won the affection and respect of many of his fellow Dominicans as well as a host of people outside the priory.<ref name=craughwell/> Word of his miracles had made him known as a saint throughout the region. As his body was displayed to allow the people of the city to pay their respects, each person snipped a tiny piece of his habit to keep as a relic. It is said that three habits were taken from the body. His body was then interred in the grounds of the monastery.\n\nAfter De Porres died, the miracles and graces received when he was invoked multiplied in such profusion that his body was exhumed after 25 years and said to be found intact, and exhaling a fine fragrance. Letters to Rome pleaded for his beatification; the decree affirming the heroism of his virtues was issued in 1763 by [[Pope Clement XIII]].\n\nPope Gregory XVI beatified Martin de Porres on 29 October 1837, and nearly 125 years later, Pope John XXIII canonized him in Rome on May 6, 1962.<ref>[http://www.opsouth.org/about-us/st-martin-de-porres/ Dorcy, Jean Marie. \"St. Martin de Porres\", ''St. Dominic's Family'',  Tan Books and Publishers, 1983]</ref> He is the [[patron saint]] of people of [[mixed race]], and of [[innkeeper]]s, barbers, [[public health]] workers and more, with a [[feast day]] on November 3.\n\nMartin is also commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the [[Church of England]] on November 3.\n\nHe is recognised as ''Papa Candelo'' in the [[Afro-Caribbean]]-Catholic [[syncretism|syncretist]] religion, which is practised in places where [[African diaspora]] culture thrives such as [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Cuba]], the [[United States]], and his native Peru.\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:San Mart\u00edn de Porres - Reconstrucci\u00f3n Facial 3D.jpg|thumb|Forensic facial reconstruction of Martin de Porres]]\nMartin de Porres is often depicted as a young mixed-race [[friar]] wearing the old habit of the Dominican lay brother, a black [[scapular]] and [[hood (headgear)|capuce]], along with a [[broom]], since he considered all work to be sacred no matter how menial. He is sometimes shown with a dog, a cat and a mouse eating in peace from the same dish.\n\n==Legacy==\nMartin's sometimes defiant attachment to the ideal of social justice achieved deep resonance in a church attempting to carry forward that ideal in today's modern world.<ref name=ewb/>\n\nToday, Martin is commemorated by, among other things, a school building that houses the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Medicine and Surgery|medical]], [[University of Santo Tomas College of Nursing|nursing]], and [[University of Santo Tomas College of Rehabilitation Sciences|rehabilitation science]] schools of the Dominican [[University of Santo Tomas]] in the [[Philippines]].\nA programme of work is also named after him at the Las Casas Institute at [[Blackfriars Hall]], University of Oxford.<ref>[http://www.bfriars.ox.ac.uk/casas_intro.php Las Casas Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709191728/http://www.bfriars.ox.ac.uk/casas_intro.php |date=2013-07-09 }} at Blackfriars Hall website</ref>  He is also the titular saint of the parish of St. Martin de Porres in Poughkeepsie, New York,<ref>[http://stmartindeporres.org/ St. Martin de Porres Parish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312072748/http://www.stmartindeporres.org/home.html|date=2013-03-12}}</ref> and some elementary schools. A number of Catholic churches are named after him.\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 1980 novel ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'', Ignatius Reilly contemplates praying to Martin for aid in bringing social justice to the black workers at the New Orleans factory where he works.

The most known movies are ''Fray Escoba'' (''Friar Broom'') (1963)<ref>{{IMDb title|54895|Fray Escoba}}</ref> and ''Un mulato llamado Martin'' (''A mulatto called Martin'') (1975).<ref>{{IMDb title|217670|Un mulato llamado Mart\u00edn}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Moone Boy]]'' episode \"Godfellas\", the character Martin Moon is shown to be named by his grandfather after San Martin de Porres.

Letters to Rome pleaded for his beatification; the decree affirming the heroism of his virtues was issued in 1763 by [[Pope Clement XIII]].\n\nPope Gregory XVI beatified Martin de Porres on 29 October 1837, and nearly 125 years later, Pope John XXIII canonized him in Rome on May 6, 1962.<ref>[http://www.opsouth.org/about-us/st-martin-de-porres/ Dorcy, Jean Marie. \"St. Martin de Porres\", ''St. Dominic's Family'',  Tan Books and Publishers, 1983]</ref> He is the [[patron saint]] of people of [[mixed race]], and of [[innkeeper]]s, barbers, [[public health]] workers and more, with a [[feast day]] on November 3.\n\nMartin is also commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the [[Church of England]] on November 3.\n\nHe is recognised as ''Papa Candelo'' in the [[Afro-Caribbean]]-Catholic [[syncretism|syncretist]] religion, which is practised in places where [[African diaspora]] culture thrives such as [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Cuba]], the [[United States]], and his native Peru.\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:San Mart\u00edn de Porres - Reconstrucci\u00f3n Facial 3D.jpg|thumb|Forensic facial reconstruction of Martin de Porres]]\nMartin de Porres is often depicted as a young mixed-race [[friar]] wearing the old habit of the Dominican lay brother, a black [[scapular]] and [[hood (headgear)|capuce]], along with a [[broom]], since he considered all work to be sacred no matter how menial.

It takes place in a fictional universe where licensed specialists known as Hunters travel the world taking on special jobs ranging from treasure hunting to assassinations. The story initially focuses on 11-year-old [[#Gon Freecss|Gon Freecss]] and his quest to become a Hunter in order to find his father, [[#Ging Freecss|Ging]], who is himself a famous Hunter. On the way, Gon meets and becomes close friends with [[#Killua Zoldyck|Killua Zoldyck]], [[#Kurapika|Kurapika]] and [[#Leorio Paradinight|Leorio Paradinight]], who all aim to become Hunters for their own reasons, and catches the attention of the murderous magician [[#Hisoka Morow|Hisoka]].\n\nAfter becoming licensed, they clash with a gang of thieves known as the [[#Phantom Troupe|Phantom Troupe]], before Gon and Killua enter the video game ''[[#Greed Island players|Greed Island]]'' in search of clues to find Ging. The two then immediately get involved in stopping the man-eating [[#Chimera Ants|Chimera Ants]] from taking over mankind. Kurapika, Leorio and the other [[#Zodiacs|Zodiacs]], a group of high-ranking Hunters, then begin escorting the [[#Kakin|Kakin Royal Family]] and [[#Beyond Netero|Beyond Netero]] on an expedition to the unexplored Dark Continent. However, the ship ride is the start of a deadly game of succession among the princes to determine who will be the next king of Kakin.\n\nAlthough the characters are humans, most possess [[superhuman]] strength and/or [[supernatural]] abilities due to [[Nen (Hunter \u00d7 Hunter)|Nen]], the ability to control one's own life energy or aura.

Having spent a lot of time in the woods as a child, he gets along very well with animals and has superhuman senses such as heightened sense of smell and sight, as well as very keen taste. Raised by [[#Mito|Mito]], Gon wants to become a Hunter in order to find his father, [[#Ging Freecss|Ging]], who is one. During the [[#Examiners|Hunter Exam]] Gon befriends Killua Zoldyck, Kurapika and Leorio Paradinight.

Gon sometimes fails to think things through and such actions lead to him suffering. Though possessing talent far beyond the norm for his age, anytime his abilities are challenged he feels as if he has to prove his antagonist wrong. He continually strives to obtain greater power, often becoming exceptionally stronger in his anger. But Gon's anger also leads to extremely reckless tendencies. When his emotions are ignited, Gon becomes irrational and completely oblivious to anything else. Gon's Nen type is Enhancement, which gives him his great strength and recuperative abilities.{{gnr|ch|60}} His [[Nen (Hunter \u00d7 Hunter)|Hatsu]] or specific use of Nen is called {{nihongo|Ja Jan Ken|\u30b8\u30e3\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u62f3}} a play on \"Janken,\" the Japanese word for [[rock-paper-scissors]].{{gnr|ch|207}} When Gon throws out \"Rock\" it is an enhanced punch, \"Scissors\" transmutes a sword from his index and middle fingers for mid-ranged attacks, and \"Paper\" emits a ball of aura for long-ranged attacks.{{gnr|ch|145|, |193|, |209}} During his fight with [[#Neferpitou|Neferpitou]], it appears that Gon entered into a Nen Contract in order to have \"all the power [he]'ll ever have\" and grew to an older age.{{gnr|ch|305|, |306|, |324}} After returning to normal thanks to [[#Alluka Zoldyck|Alluka Zoldyck]]'s ability, Gon has lost the ability to use Nen.{{gnr|ch|333|, |334|, |345}} Gon is a popular character with fans, coming in third place in the series' first two popularity polls.<ref name=\"firstpoppoll\">{{cite book | last = Togashi | first = Yoshihiro | title = Hunter \u00d7 Hunter, Volume 7 | year = 2006 | publisher = [[Viz Media]] | pages = 27\u201328 | isbn = 978-1-4215-0332-5}}</ref><ref name=\"secondpoppoll\">{{cite book | last = Togashi | first = Yoshihiro | title = Hunter \u00d7 Hunter, Volume 12 | year = 2007 | publisher = Viz Media | pages = 184\u2013185 | isbn = 978-1-4215-0647-0}}</ref>\n\n=== Killua Zoldyck ===\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kanako Mitsuhashi]] (1999 series, Japanese),<ref name=\"firstanime\">{{cite web | url = http://www.nippon-animation.co.jp/na/hunter/chara/chara_top.html | title = ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' character and cast list | publisher =[[Nippon Animation]]  | language = Japanese | accessdate = February 24, 2018 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090925064820/http://www.nippon-animation.co.jp/na/hunter/chara/chara_top.html | archivedate = September 25, 2009 }}</ref> Annika Odegard (1999 series, English),<ref name=\"English\"/> [[Mariya Ise]] (2011 series, Japanese),<ref name=\"2011Main\"/> [[Cristina Vee]] (2011 series, English)<ref name=\"English\"/>}}\n{{nihongo|Killua Zoldyck|\u30ad\u30eb\u30a2\uff1d\u30be\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30c3\u30af|Kirua Zorudikku}} is initially introduced as a cheeky, cheerful kid full of mischievous ideas who befriends Gon during the Hunter Exam. However, his ruthlessness and aptitude in killing shows the other side of him \u2014 deadly, violent, and bloodthirsty. A member of the famous [[#Zoldyck Family|Zoldyck Family]] of assassins, Killua has been trained to be an assassin since birth and conditioned to possess extreme tolerance for poison, electricity and pain. Although Killua fails during his first Hunter Exam by killing an opponent, suspected to be due to his elder brother [[#Illumi Zoldyck|Illumi]]'s influence, he attends the exam again the following year, earning his license by eliminating all other applicants in the very first trial.{{gnr|ch|36|, |37|, |148}} Killua and Gon learn about Nen from Wing and later train further under Biscuit Krueger.{{gnr|ch|47|, |48|, |137}} He becomes one of the first people to beat ''Greed Island'', helps stop the Chimera Ants, and uses his sibling Alluka's special abilities to heal the nearly-dead Gon.\n\nConflicting with Killua's predisposition to kill is his unyielding loyalty to his new friends. Killua puts them before himself without being concerned about his own health or even his life and without a single complaint. Previously, Killua's greatest flaw was his fear of those seemingly more powerful than him.{{gnr|ch|210}} Killua had been trained as an assassin by Illumi to be extremely cautious and only engage in combat if victory is absolutely certain. Showing great promise from birth, he possesses extraordinary agility and strength that makes Killua a one-man killing machine. Killua has already mastered many killing techniques at a tender age and is set to be one of the best assassins his family has ever produced. His Nen type is Transmutation, which allows him to change the properties of his aura into electricity.{{gnr|ch|60|, |122}} His Hatsu involves various uses of electricity to increase his physical capabilities, such as {{nihongo|Godspeed|{{ruby-ja|\u795e\u901f|\u30ab\u30f3\u30e0\u30eb}}|Kanmuru}}, which allows him to move at immeasurable speeds.{{gnr|ch|281}} Killua is a popular character with fans, coming in first place in the series' first two popularity polls.<ref name=\"firstpoppoll\"/><ref name=\"secondpoppoll\"/>\n\n=== Kurapika ===\n:{{Voiced by|[[Noriko Hidaka]] (1998 film), [[Yuki Kaida]] (1999 series, Japanese),<ref name=\"firstanime\"/> Cheryl McMaster (1999 series, English), [[Miyuki Sawashiro]] (2011 series, Japanese),<ref name=\"2011Main\"/> [[Erika Harlacher]] (2011 series, English)<ref name=\"English\"/>}}\n{{nihongo|Kurapika|\u30af\u30e9\u30d4\u30ab}} is the sole survivor of the {{nihongo|Kurta|\u30af\u30eb\u30bf|Kuruta}} clan, a race with treasured irises that turn scarlet in times of anger or emotional agitation.{{gnr|ch|7}} Four years before the series, the entire Kurta clan was eradicated by a band of thieves known as the [[#Phantom Troupe|Phantom Troupe]].{{gnr|ch|2}} The Troupe desecrated the bodies of his race by stealing their scarlet eyes following the genocide, thereafter selling them on the black market. He participates in the Hunter Exam alongside Gon, Leorio and Killua in order to become a Blacklist Hunter and gain the resources to take vengeance for his race and retrieve their eyes.{{gnr|ch|2|, |7}} Despite being a moralist, Kurapika is not above adjoining himself to society's underworld in order to accomplish his own desires \u2014 aligning himself with the [[#Nostrade Family|Nostrade]] mafia family as soon as the opportunity presents itself. After becoming a licensed Hunter, he soon becomes head of Nostrade's bodyguards.{{gnr|ch|79}} Normally intelligent, quick-thinking and levelheaded, when Kurapika sees a spider, the symbol of the Phantom Troupe, he becomes enraged.{{gnr|ch|18}} He kills [[#Uvogin|Uvogin]], causes [[#Pakunoda|Pakunoda]]'s death, and seals [[#Chrollo Lucilfer|Chrollo Lucilfer]]'s Nen. He is later invited to join the [[#Zodiacs|Zodiacs]] as the \"[[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]]\" at Leorio's recommendation and only accepts upon being told that [[#Tserriednich Hui Guo Rou|Tserriednich Hui Guo Rou]] has the last batch of scarlet eyes that he needs to retrieve.{{gnr|ch|344|, |345}} This leads to his accompanying [[#Woble Hui Guo Rou|Woble Hui Guo Rou]] to the Dark Continent as her bodyguard.\n\nKurapika's Nen type is Conjuration, however, when his eyes turn scarlet, he becomes a Specialist.{{gnr|ch|83}} He conjures a unique weapon \u2014 five chains, one extending from each finger on his right hand.

Although he was born as an Enhancer, Kastro's ability completely ignores his strengths and uses Conjuration and Manipulation. Furthermore, his conjured doppelg\u00e4nger is also flawed in that although Kastro gets dirtied from blows dealt to him, it remains spotless in combat due to it being merely a reflection of what he sees of himself, thus making it easy to distinguish between the two.{{gnr|ch|54}}\n\n=== Nostrade Family ===\nThe Nostrade Family is the mafia family that Kurapika joins in order to find information concerning his people's stolen Scarlet Eyes.

It takes place in a fictional universe where licensed specialists known as Hunters travel the world taking on special jobs ranging from treasure hunting to assassinations. The story initially focuses on 11-year-old [[#Gon Freecss|Gon Freecss]] and his quest to become a Hunter in order to find his father, [[#Ging Freecss|Ging]], who is himself a famous Hunter. On the way, Gon meets and becomes close friends with [[#Killua Zoldyck|Killua Zoldyck]], [[#Kurapika|Kurapika]] and [[#Leorio Paradinight|Leorio Paradinight]], who all aim to become Hunters for their own reasons, and catches the attention of the murderous magician [[#Hisoka Morow|Hisoka]].\n\nAfter becoming licensed, they clash with a gang of thieves known as the [[#Phantom Troupe|Phantom Troupe]], before Gon and Killua enter the video game ''[[#Greed Island players|Greed Island]]'' in search of clues to find Ging. The two then immediately get involved in stopping the man-eating [[#Chimera Ants|Chimera Ants]] from taking over mankind. Kurapika, Leorio and the other [[#Zodiacs|Zodiacs]], a group of high-ranking Hunters, then begin escorting the [[#Kakin|Kakin Royal Family]] and [[#Beyond Netero|Beyond Netero]] on an expedition to the unexplored Dark Continent. However, the ship ride is the start of a deadly game of succession among the princes to determine who will be the next king of Kakin.\n\nAlthough the characters are humans, most possess [[superhuman]] strength and/or [[supernatural]] abilities due to [[Nen (Hunter \u00d7 Hunter)|Nen]], the ability to control one's own life energy or aura. The world of the series also includes fantastical beasts such as the Chimera Ants.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Protagonists==\n\n=== Gon Freecss ===\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rica Matsumoto]] (1998 film, Japanese), [[Junko Takeuchi]] (1999 series, Japanese),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2011-11-01/interview-junko-takeuchi|title=Interview: Junko Takeuchi|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2011-11-01|accessdate=2018-02-24}}</ref> [[Elinor Holt]] (1999 series, English),<ref name=\"English\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/03/19-1/viz-announces-hunter-x-hunter-english-dub-cast|title=Viz Announces \"Hunter x Hunter\" English Dub Cast|work=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=2016-03-19|accessdate=2016-03-26}}</ref> [[Megumi Han]] (2011 series, Japanese),<ref name=\"2011Main\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2011/08/18/character-design-preview-for-new-hunter-x-hunter-anime|title=Character Design Preview for New Hunter x Hunter Anime|work=Crunchyroll|date=2011-08-18|accessdate=2016-03-26}}</ref> [[Erica Mendez]] (2011 series, English)<ref name=\"English\"/>}}\n{{nihongo|Gon Freecss|\u30b4\u30f3\uff1d\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af\u30b9|Gon Fur\u012bkusu|lead=yes}} is the main protagonist of the series and an athletic, na\u00efve, and friendly boy. Having spent a lot of time in the woods as a child, he gets along very well with animals and has superhuman senses such as heightened sense of smell and sight, as well as very keen taste. Raised by [[#Mito|Mito]], Gon wants to become a Hunter in order to find his father, [[#Ging Freecss|Ging]], who is one. During the [[#Examiners|Hunter Exam]] Gon befriends Killua Zoldyck, Kurapika and Leorio Paradinight.

Gon sometimes fails to think things through and such actions lead to him suffering. Though possessing talent far beyond the norm for his age, anytime his abilities are challenged he feels as if he has to prove his antagonist wrong. He continually strives to obtain greater power, often becoming exceptionally stronger in his anger. But Gon's anger also leads to extremely reckless tendencies. When his emotions are ignited, Gon becomes irrational and completely oblivious to anything else. Gon's Nen type is Enhancement, which gives him his great strength and recuperative abilities.{{gnr|ch|60}} His [[Nen (Hunter \u00d7 Hunter)|Hatsu]] or specific use of Nen is called {{nihongo|Ja Jan Ken|\u30b8\u30e3\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u62f3}} a play on \"Janken,\" the Japanese word for [[rock-paper-scissors]].{{gnr|ch|207}} When Gon throws out \"Rock\" it is an enhanced punch, \"Scissors\" transmutes a sword from his index and middle fingers for mid-ranged attacks, and \"Paper\" emits a ball of aura for long-ranged attacks.{{gnr|ch|145|, |193|, |209}} During his fight with [[#Neferpitou|Neferpitou]], it appears that Gon entered into a Nen Contract in order to have \"all the power [he]'ll ever have\" and grew to an older age.{{gnr|ch|305|, |306|, |324}} After returning to normal thanks to [[#Alluka Zoldyck|Alluka Zoldyck]]'s ability, Gon has lost the ability to use Nen.{{gnr|ch|333|, |334|, |345}} Gon is a popular character with fans, coming in third place in the series' first two popularity polls.<ref name=\"firstpoppoll\">{{cite book | last = Togashi | first = Yoshihiro | title = Hunter \u00d7 Hunter, Volume 7 | year = 2006 | publisher = [[Viz Media]] | pages = 27\u201328 | isbn = 978-1-4215-0332-5}}</ref><ref name=\"secondpoppoll\">{{cite book | last = Togashi | first = Yoshihiro | title = Hunter \u00d7 Hunter, Volume 12 | year = 2007 | publisher = Viz Media | pages = 184\u2013185 | isbn = 978-1-4215-0647-0}}</ref>\n\n=== Killua Zoldyck ===\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kanako Mitsuhashi]] (1999 series, Japanese),<ref name=\"firstanime\">{{cite web | url = http://www.nippon-animation.co.jp/na/hunter/chara/chara_top.html | title = ''Hunter \u00d7 Hunter'' character and cast list | publisher =[[Nippon Animation]]  | language = Japanese | accessdate = February 24, 2018 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090925064820/http://www.nippon-animation.co.jp/na/hunter/chara/chara_top.html | archivedate = September 25, 2009 }}</ref> Annika Odegard (1999 series, English),<ref name=\"English\"/> [[Mariya Ise]] (2011 series, Japanese),<ref name=\"2011Main\"/> [[Cristina Vee]] (2011 series, English)<ref name=\"English\"/>}}\n{{nihongo|Killua Zoldyck|\u30ad\u30eb\u30a2\uff1d\u30be\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30c3\u30af|Kirua Zorudikku}} is initially introduced as a cheeky, cheerful kid full of mischievous ideas who befriends Gon during the Hunter Exam. However, his ruthlessness and aptitude in killing shows the other side of him \u2014 deadly, violent, and bloodthirsty. A member of the famous [[#Zoldyck Family|Zoldyck Family]] of assassins, Killua has been trained to be an assassin since birth and conditioned to possess extreme tolerance for poison, electricity and pain. Although Killua fails during his first Hunter Exam by killing an opponent, suspected to be due to his elder brother [[#Illumi Zoldyck|Illumi]]'s influence, he attends the exam again the following year, earning his license by eliminating all other applicants in the very first trial.{{gnr|ch|36|, |37|, |148}} Killua and Gon learn about Nen from Wing and later train further under Biscuit Krueger.{{gnr|ch|47|, |48|, |137}} He becomes one of the first people to beat ''Greed Island'', helps stop the Chimera Ants, and uses his sibling Alluka's special abilities to heal the nearly-dead Gon.\n\nConflicting with Killua's predisposition to kill is his unyielding loyalty to his new friends. Killua puts them before himself without being concerned about his own health or even his life and without a single complaint. Previously, Killua's greatest flaw was his fear of those seemingly more powerful than him.{{gnr|ch|210}} Killua had been trained as an assassin by Illumi to be extremely cautious and only engage in combat if victory is absolutely certain. Showing great promise from birth, he possesses extraordinary agility and strength that makes Killua a one-man killing machine. Killua has already mastered many killing techniques at a tender age and is set to be one of the best assassins his family has ever produced. His Nen type is Transmutation, which allows him to change the properties of his aura into electricity.{{gnr|ch|60|, |122}} His Hatsu involves various uses of electricity to increase his physical capabilities, such as {{nihongo|Godspeed|{{ruby-ja|\u795e\u901f|\u30ab\u30f3\u30e0\u30eb}}|Kanmuru}}, which allows him to move at immeasurable speeds.{{gnr|ch|281}} Killua is a popular character with fans, coming in first place in the series' first two popularity polls.<ref name=\"firstpoppoll\"/><ref name=\"secondpoppoll\"/>\n\n=== Kurapika ===\n:{{Voiced by|[[Noriko Hidaka]] (1998 film), [[Yuki Kaida]] (1999 series, Japanese),<ref name=\"firstanime\"/> Cheryl McMaster (1999 series, English), [[Miyuki Sawashiro]] (2011 series, Japanese),<ref name=\"2011Main\"/> [[Erika Harlacher]] (2011 series, English)<ref name=\"English\"/>}}\n{{nihongo|Kurapika|\u30af\u30e9\u30d4\u30ab}} is the sole survivor of the {{nihongo|Kurta|\u30af\u30eb\u30bf|Kuruta}} clan, a race with treasured irises that turn scarlet in times of anger or emotional agitation.{{gnr|ch|7}} Four years before the series, the entire Kurta clan was eradicated by a band of thieves known as the [[#Phantom Troupe|Phantom Troupe]].{{gnr|ch|2}} The Troupe desecrated the bodies of his race by stealing their scarlet eyes following the genocide, thereafter selling them on the black market. He participates in the Hunter Exam alongside Gon, Leorio and Killua in order to become a Blacklist Hunter and gain the resources to take vengeance for his race and retrieve their eyes.{{gnr|ch|2|, |7}} Despite being a moralist, Kurapika is not above adjoining himself to society's underworld in order to accomplish his own desires \u2014 aligning himself with the [[#Nostrade Family|Nostrade]] mafia family as soon as the opportunity presents itself. After becoming a licensed Hunter, he soon becomes head of Nostrade's bodyguards.{{gnr|ch|79}} Normally intelligent, quick-thinking and levelheaded, when Kurapika sees a spider, the symbol of the Phantom Troupe, he becomes enraged.{{gnr|ch|18}} He kills [[#Uvogin|Uvogin]], causes [[#Pakunoda|Pakunoda]]'s death, and seals [[#Chrollo Lucilfer|Chrollo Lucilfer]]'s Nen. He is later invited to join the [[#Zodiacs|Zodiacs]] as the \"[[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]]\" at Leorio's recommendation and only accepts upon being told that [[#Tserriednich Hui Guo Rou|Tserriednich Hui Guo Rou]] has the last batch of scarlet eyes that he needs to retrieve.{{gnr|ch|344|, |345}} This leads to his accompanying [[#Woble Hui Guo Rou|Woble Hui Guo Rou]] to the Dark Continent as her bodyguard.\n\nKurapika's Nen type is Conjuration, however, when his eyes turn scarlet, he becomes a Specialist.{{gnr|ch|83}} He conjures a unique weapon \u2014 five chains, one extending from each finger on his right hand.

Although he was born as an Enhancer, Kastro's ability completely ignores his strengths and uses Conjuration and Manipulation. Furthermore, his conjured doppelg\u00e4nger is also flawed in that although Kastro gets dirtied from blows dealt to him, it remains spotless in combat due to it being merely a reflection of what he sees of himself, thus making it easy to distinguish between the two.{{gnr|ch|54}}\n\n=== Nostrade Family ===\nThe Nostrade Family is the mafia family that Kurapika joins in order to find information concerning his people's stolen Scarlet Eyes.

In this book, there were illustrations of human beings who were separated by race, but were illustrated with what Cobb called \"equal dignity.\" This instigated a pondering on the concept of race, as the same type of \"equal dignity\" was not granted in the society that surrounded Cobb's life.\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1921, Cobb graduated from [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]], a highly esteemed Washington, DC. African American high school<ref name=\":0\" />. He then went on to earn his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Amherst College]] in 1925. Following completion of his baccalaureate degree, Cobb received a [[Blodgett Scholarship]] for proficiency in biology which allowed him to pursue research in [[embryology]] at [[Marine Biological Laboratory|Woods Hole Marine Biology Laboratory]] . He earned his MD ([[Doctor of Medicine]]) in 1929 from the [[Howard University]] Medical School. He worked jobs throughout his time in medical school.<ref>https://www.cobbresearchlab.com/issue-1/2015/1/26/the-life-of-dr-william-montague-cobb</ref> Cobb then accepted a position at Howard University which he was offered prior to his graduation<ref name=\":0\" />. [[Numa Pompilius Garfield Adams|Numa P.G. Adams]], who was the [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of Howard University at the time, was assigned the task of organizing a new faculty of African American physicians to help advance the school in the medical field. Cobb, in turn had the aspirations of creating a laboratory of [[anatomy]] and physical anthropology at Howard University that would have the resources for African American scholars to contribute to debates in [[racial biology]]. As a part of Dean Adams' efforts, Cobb was sent to study under biological anthropologist T.

He undertook studies within the scope of his expertise in anatomy that aimed at disproving racist explanations for social difference. He believed that scholars must take responsibility \"not only for their own thoughts and actions but also for their own society\" because he believed that the values that are expressed in scientific work, whether subtly or overtly, are key in the shaping of culture and society. He aspired to be the first anthropologist to undertake a demographic analysis that would expose the toll racism was taking on the African American population, and he wanted to create the resources so he would not be the last. His work illustrated the consequences of segregation and racism, and used his work to confront these issues. \n\nCobb was long involved in the African identified descendants' struggle for freedom, justice, and equality. He was a member of the board of directors for the [[NAACP]] since 1949 and president from 1976 to 1982. He was also active in the Associate's District of Columbia Branch prior to assuming roles in the national organization <ref name=\":0\" />.
