Gradually, a market developed at the bank and became a major place of economic activity. The bank was covered with stones to help dock ships and vessels, and the market was developed at a place that was fully covered with stones. People started to refer to the place as ''Shiler Chor'', meaning \"a bank of stones\". With the passage of time, ''Shiler Chor'' was simplified to ''Silchar'', and ultimately the British officials started to use the name ''Silchar'' in their official documents referring to the surrounding area of the market. Thus Silchar became the official name of the place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/544040/Silchar |title=Silchar (India) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Britannica.com |date=|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Sonu(Composer)\n\n==History==\n===Cachar district records===\nIn the 1850s, [[British East India Company|British]] tea planters re-discovered the game [[polo]] in [[Manipur]] on the Burmese border with India.

Gradually, a market developed at the bank and became a major place of economic activity. The bank was covered with stones to help dock ships and vessels, and the market was developed at a place that was fully covered with stones. People started to refer to the place as ''Shiler Chor'', meaning \"a bank of stones\". With the passage of time, ''Shiler Chor'' was simplified to ''Silchar'', and ultimately the British officials started to use the name ''Silchar'' in their official documents referring to the surrounding area of the market. Thus Silchar became the official name of the place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/544040/Silchar |title=Silchar (India) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Britannica.com |date=|accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Sonu(Composer)\n\n==History==\n===Cachar district records===\nIn the 1850s, [[British East India Company|British]] tea planters re-discovered the game [[polo]] in [[Manipur]] on the Burmese border with India.

The forces experienced by the rider are constantly changing, leading to feelings of joy in some riders and nausea in others. The basic principles of [[roller coaster]] mechanics have been known since 1865,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and since then roller coasters have become a popular diversion.\n\n==Centripetal acceleration==\n[[File:CoasterH=2.5r.gif|thumb|showing the centripetal acceleration and tangential acceleration with radius of loop r = 3.33m, height of release H = 2.5r = 8.325m. bigger r loop will feel less acceleration ac]] [[File:CoasterH=2.5raccelerationlowr=2.5.gif|thumb|showing the centripetal acceleration and tangential acceleration with radius of loop r = 2.50m, height of release H = 3.33r = 8.325m. smaller r loop will feel greater acceleration ac]]\nCentrifugal (center fleeing) force is not a true force, but rather the result of an object's [[inertia]], or resistance to change in direction, as the object moves in a circular path. The track's curve prevents the object from following the straight line it otherwise would, by applying a force on it (via its outside edges) towards the center of the circle, forcing it to travel in a curved path instead. This [[centripetal force|centripetal (center seeking) force]] actually points toward the center of the circle, but a roller coaster rider experiences (feels) the sensation of a [[centrifugal force]], a ''pseudo'' force pushing them toward the outer edge of the car. This sensation is actually the result of the rider's inertia.  The following equation expresses centripetal acceleration (to make it centripetal force simply multiply by the mass): \n<math> a_c =  \\frac {v^2}{r}</math>\n\nwhere ''a<sub>c</sub>'' is centripetal acceleration, ''v'' is velocity and ''r'' is the [[radius]] of the circular path. This shows that two roller coaster cars entering two loops of different size at the same speed will experience different acceleration forces: the car in the tighter loop will feel greater acceleration while the car in the wider loop will feel less acceleration.\n\n==Energy==\nInstead, the car is pulled to the top of the first hill and released, at which point it rolls freely along the track without any external mechanical assistance for the remainder of the ride. The purpose of the ascent of the first hill is to build up [[potential energy]] that will then be converted to [[kinetic energy]] as the ride progresses. The initial hill, or the [[lift hill]], is the tallest in the entire ride. As the train is pulled to the top, it gains potential energy, as explained by the equation for [[potential energy]] below:\n\n<math>U_g = mgh</math>\n\nwhere ''U<sub>g</sub>'' is potential energy, ''m'' is [[mass]], ''g'' is [[standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity]] and ''h'' is height above the ground. Two trains of identical mass at different heights will therefore have different potential energies: the train at a greater height will have more potential energy than a train at a lower height. This means that the potential energy for the roller coaster system is greatest at the highest point on the track, or the top of the lift hill. As the roller coaster train begins its descent from the lift hill, the stored potential energy converts to kinetic energy, or energy of [[Motion (physics)|motion]]. The faster the train moves, the more kinetic energy the train gains, as shown by the equation for kinetic energy:\n\n<math>K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2</math>\n\nwhere ''K'' is [[kinetic energy]], ''m'' is mass, and ''v'' is velocity. Because the mass of a roller coaster car remains constant, if the speed is increased, the kinetic energy must also increase. This means that the kinetic energy for the roller coaster system is greatest at the bottom of the largest downhill slope on the track, typically at the bottom of the lift hill. When the train begins to climb the next hill on the track, the train's kinetic energy is converted back into potential energy, decreasing the train's velocity. This process of converting kinetic energy to potential energy and back to kinetic energy continues with each hill. The energy is never destroyed, but is lost to [[friction]] between the car and track. Brakes bring the ride to a complete stop.\n\n==Inertia and gravity==\n\nWhen going around a roller coaster's [[vertical loop]], the inertia that produces a thrilling acceleration force also keeps passengers in their seats. As the car approaches a loop, the direction of a passenger's inertial velocity points straight ahead at the same angle as the track leading up to the loop. As the car enters the loop, the track guides the car up, moving the passenger up as well.

The forces experienced by the rider are constantly changing, leading to feelings of joy in some riders and nausea in others. The basic principles of [[roller coaster]] mechanics have been known since 1865,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and since then roller coasters have become a popular diversion.\n\n==Centripetal acceleration==\n[[File:CoasterH=2.5r.gif|thumb|showing the centripetal acceleration and tangential acceleration with radius of loop r = 3.33m, height of release H = 2.5r = 8.325m. bigger r loop will feel less acceleration ac]] [[File:CoasterH=2.5raccelerationlowr=2.5.gif|thumb|showing the centripetal acceleration and tangential acceleration with radius of loop r = 2.50m, height of release H = 3.33r = 8.325m. smaller r loop will feel greater acceleration ac]]\nCentrifugal (center fleeing) force is not a true force, but rather the result of an object's [[inertia]], or resistance to change in direction, as the object moves in a circular path. The track's curve prevents the object from following the straight line it otherwise would, by applying a force on it (via its outside edges) towards the center of the circle, forcing it to travel in a curved path instead. This [[centripetal force|centripetal (center seeking) force]] actually points toward the center of the circle, but a roller coaster rider experiences (feels) the sensation of a [[centrifugal force]], a ''pseudo'' force pushing them toward the outer edge of the car. This sensation is actually the result of the rider's inertia.  The following equation expresses centripetal acceleration (to make it centripetal force simply multiply by the mass): \n<math> a_c =  \\frac {v^2}{r}</math>\n\nwhere ''a<sub>c</sub>'' is centripetal acceleration, ''v'' is velocity and ''r'' is the [[radius]] of the circular path. This shows that two roller coaster cars entering two loops of different size at the same speed will experience different acceleration forces: the car in the tighter loop will feel greater acceleration while the car in the wider loop will feel less acceleration.\n\n==Energy==\nInstead, the car is pulled to the top of the first hill and released, at which point it rolls freely along the track without any external mechanical assistance for the remainder of the ride. The purpose of the ascent of the first hill is to build up [[potential energy]] that will then be converted to [[kinetic energy]] as the ride progresses. The initial hill, or the [[lift hill]], is the tallest in the entire ride. As the train is pulled to the top, it gains potential energy, as explained by the equation for [[potential energy]] below:\n\n<math>U_g = mgh</math>\n\nwhere ''U<sub>g</sub>'' is potential energy, ''m'' is [[mass]], ''g'' is [[standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity]] and ''h'' is height above the ground. Two trains of identical mass at different heights will therefore have different potential energies: the train at a greater height will have more potential energy than a train at a lower height. This means that the potential energy for the roller coaster system is greatest at the highest point on the track, or the top of the lift hill. As the roller coaster train begins its descent from the lift hill, the stored potential energy converts to kinetic energy, or energy of [[Motion (physics)|motion]]. The faster the train moves, the more kinetic energy the train gains, as shown by the equation for kinetic energy:\n\n<math>K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2</math>\n\nwhere ''K'' is [[kinetic energy]], ''m'' is mass, and ''v'' is velocity. Because the mass of a roller coaster car remains constant, if the speed is increased, the kinetic energy must also increase. This means that the kinetic energy for the roller coaster system is greatest at the bottom of the largest downhill slope on the track, typically at the bottom of the lift hill. When the train begins to climb the next hill on the track, the train's kinetic energy is converted back into potential energy, decreasing the train's velocity. This process of converting kinetic energy to potential energy and back to kinetic energy continues with each hill. The energy is never destroyed, but is lost to [[friction]] between the car and track. Brakes bring the ride to a complete stop.\n\n==Inertia and gravity==\n\nWhen going around a roller coaster's [[vertical loop]], the inertia that produces a thrilling acceleration force also keeps passengers in their seats. As the car approaches a loop, the direction of a passenger's inertial velocity points straight ahead at the same angle as the track leading up to the loop. As the car enters the loop, the track guides the car up, moving the passenger up as well. This change in direction creates a feeling of [[g-force|extra gravity]] as the passenger is pushed down into the seat.\n\nAt the top of the loop, the force of the car's acceleration pushes the passenger off the seat toward the center of the loop, while inertia pushes the passenger back into the seat. Gravity and acceleration forces push the passenger in opposite directions with nearly equal force, creating a sensation of [[weightlessness]].\n\nAt the bottom of the loop, gravity and the change in direction of the passenger's inertia from a downward vertical direction to one that is horizontal push the passenger into the seat, causing the passenger to once again feel very heavy.

This is the point to which a force may be applied to cause a [[linear acceleration]] without an [[angular acceleration]]. Calculations in [[mechanics]] are often simplified when formulated with respect to the center of mass. It is a hypothetical point where entire mass of an object may be assumed to be concentrated to visualise its motion. In other words, the center of mass is the particle equivalent of a given object for application of [[Newton's laws of motion]].\n\nIn the case of a single [[rigid body]], the center of mass is fixed in relation to the body, and if the body has uniform density, it will be located at the [[centroid]].  The center of mass may be located outside the physical body, as is sometimes the case for [[wikt:hollow|hollow]] or open-shaped objects, such as a [[horseshoe]].  In the case of a distribution of separate bodies, such as the [[planets]] of the [[Solar System]], the center of mass may not correspond to the position of any individual member of the system.\n\nThe center of mass is a useful reference point for calculations in [[mechanics]] that involve masses distributed in space, such as the [[momentum|linear]] and [[angular momentum]] of planetary bodies and [[rigid body dynamics]]. In [[orbital mechanics]], the equations of motion of planets are formulated as [[point mass]]es located at the centers of mass.  The [[center of mass frame]] is an [[inertial frame]] in which the center of mass of a system is at rest with respect to the origin of the coordinate system.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of \"center of mass\" in the form of the '''center of gravity''' was first introduced by the  great ancient Greek physicist, mathematician, and engineer [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]]. He worked with simplified assumptions about gravity that amount to a uniform field, thus arriving at the mathematical properties of what we now call the center of mass. Archimedes showed that the [[torque]] exerted on a [[lever]] by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point\u2014their center of mass. In work on floating bodies he demonstrated that the orientation of a floating object is the one that makes its center of mass as low as possible. He developed mathematical techniques for finding the centers of mass of objects of uniform density of various well-defined shapes.{{sfn|Shore|2008|pp=9\u201311}}\n\nLater mathematicians who developed the theory of the center of mass include [[Pappus of Alexandria]], [[Guido Ubaldi]], [[Francesco Maurolico]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=91\u201394}} [[Federico Commandino]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=94\u201396}} [[Simon Stevin]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=96\u2013101}} [[Luca Valerio]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=101\u2013106}} [[Jean-Charles de la Faille]], [[Paul Guldin]],{{sfn|Mancosu|1999|pp=56\u201361}} [[John Wallis]], [[Louis Carr\u00e9 (mathematician)|Louis Carr\u00e9]], [[Pierre Varignon]], and [[Alexis Clairaut]].{{sfn|Walton|1855|p=2}}\n\n[[Newton's second law]] is reformulated with respect to the center of mass in [[Euler's laws#Euler's first law|Euler's first law]].{{sfn|Beatty|2006|p=29}}\n[[File:CoG stable.svg|thumb|Diagram of an educational toy that balances on a point: the center of mass (C) settles below its support (P)]]\n<!---Please put this section back if you can revise it\n==Center of gravity==\nThe term \"center of mass\" is often used interchangeably with the term '''center of gravity''' because any uniform [[Newton's law of universal gravitation#Gravitational field|gravitational field]] '''g''' acts on a system as if the mass ''M'' of the system were concentrated at the center of mass '''R'''. The center of gravity is defined as the average position of weight distribution, and mass and weight are technically different properties. However, because weight and mass are proportional, the center of gravity and center of mass refer to the same point of an object for almost all objects on and near Earth's surface. Generally, physicists prefer to use the term ''center of mass'', as an object has a center of mass whether or not it is under the influence of gravity. In addition, the term \"center of gravity\" refers to the single point associated with an object where the force of [[Gravitation|gravity]] can be considered to act,\n\nSpecifically, the [[gravitational potential energy]] is equal to the potential energy of a point mass ''M'' at '''R''',{{sfn|Goldstein|Poole|Safko|2001|p=185}} and the gravitational [[torque]] is equal to the torque of a force ''M'''''g''' acting at '''R'''.{{sfn|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|p=19.3}} In a uniform gravitational field, the center of mass is a center of gravity, and in common usage, the two phrases are used as synonyms.\n\nIn a non-uniform field, gravitational effects such as [[potential energy]], [[force]], and [[torque]] can no longer be calculated using the center of mass alone. In particular, a non-uniform gravitational field can produce a torque on an object, causing it to rotate. The center of gravity, an application point of the [[resultant force|resultant]] gravitational force, may not exist or not be unique; see [[centers of gravity in non-uniform fields]].\n-->\n\n=={{anchor|Definition of center of mass}}Definition==\nThe center of mass is the unique point at the center of a distribution of mass in space that has the property that the weighted position vectors relative to this point sum to zero. In analogy to statistics, the center of mass is the mean location of a distribution of mass in space.\n\n===A system of particles===\nIn the case of a system of particles {{math|1=''P<sub>i</sub>'', ''i'' = 1,\u2009\u2026,\u2009''n''\u2009}}, each with mass {{mvar|m<sub>i</sub>}} that are located in space with coordinates {{math|1='''r'''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i'' = 1,\u2009\u2026,\u2009''n''\u2009}}, the coordinates '''R''' of the center of mass satisfy the condition\n:<math> \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}) = 0.</math>\nSolving this equation for '''R''' yields the formula\n:<math>\\mathbf{R} = \\frac 1M \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \\mathbf{r}_i,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|M}} is the sum of the masses of all of the particles.\n\n===A continuous volume===\nIf the mass distribution is continuous with the density \u03c1('''r''') within a solid ''Q'', then the integral of the weighted position coordinates of the points in this volume relative to the center of mass '''R''' over the volume '''V''' is zero, that is\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_{Q} \\rho(\\mathbf{r})(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})dV = 0.</math>\nSolve this equation for the coordinates '''R''' to obtain\n:<math>\\mathbf R = \\frac 1M \\iiint\\limits_{Q}\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\mathbf{r} dV,</math>\nwhere M is the total mass in the volume.\n\nIf a continuous mass distribution has uniform [[density]], which means \u03c1 is constant, then the center of mass is the same as the [[centroid]] of the volume.{{sfn|Levi|2009|p=85}}\n\n===Barycentric coordinates===\n{{further|Barycentric coordinate system}}\nThe coordinates '''R''' of the center of mass of a two-particle system, ''P<sub>1</sub>'' and ''P<sub>2</sub>'', with masses ''m<sub>1</sub>'' and ''m<sub>2</sub>'' is given by\n:<math> \\mathbf{R} = \\frac{1}{m_1+m_2}(m_1 \\mathbf{r}_1 + m_2\\mathbf{r}_2).</math>\nLet the percentage of the total mass divided between these two particles vary from 100% ''P<sub>1</sub>'' and 0% ''P<sub>2</sub>'' through 50% ''P<sub>1</sub>'' and 50% ''P<sub>2</sub>'' to 0% ''P<sub>1</sub>'' and 100% ''P<sub>2</sub>'', then the center of mass '''R''' moves along the line from ''P<sub>1</sub>'' to ''P<sub>2</sub>''.  The percentages of mass at each point can be viewed as projective coordinates of the point '''R''' on this line, and are termed barycentric coordinates. Another way of interpreting the process here is the mechanical balancing of moments about an arbitrary point. The numerator gives the total moment that is then balanced by an equivalent total force at the center of mass. This can be generalized to three points and four points to define projective coordinates in the plane, and in space, respectively.\n\n==={{anchor|Cluster straddling}}Systems with periodic boundary conditions===\nFor particles in a system with [[periodic boundary conditions]] two particles can be neighbours even though they are on opposite sides of the system. This occurs often in [[molecular dynamics]] simulations, for example, in which clusters form at random locations and sometimes neighbouring atoms cross the periodic boundary. When a cluster straddles the periodic boundary, a naive calculation of the center of mass will be incorrect. A generalized method for calculating the center of mass for periodic systems is to treat each coordinate, ''x'' and ''y'' and/or ''z'', as if it were on a circle instead of a line.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = Linge\n | last = Bai\n | author2=Breen, David\n | date = 2008\n | title = Calculating Center of Mass in an Unbounded 2D Environment\n | journal = Journal of Graphics, GPU, and Game Tools\n | volume = 13\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 53\u201360\n | doi =  10.1080/2151237X.2008.10129266\n }}</ref>\nThe calculation takes every particle's ''x'' coordinate and maps it to an angle,\n \n:<math>\\theta_i = \\frac{x_i}{x_{max}} 2 \\pi </math>\n \nwhere ''x''<sub>max</sub> is the system size in the ''x'' direction and <math>x_i\\in[0,x_{max})</math>.

If both average values are zero, <math>(\\overline{\\xi},\\overline{\\zeta}) = (0,0)</math>, then <math>\\overline{\\theta}</math> is undefined. This is a correct result, because it only occurs when all particles are exactly evenly spaced. In that condition, their ''x'' coordinates are mathematically identical in a [[periodic boundary conditions#Practical implementation: continuity and the minimum image convention|periodic system]].\n\n==Center of gravity==\n{{redirect|Center of gravity}}\n{{main|Centers of gravity in non-uniform fields}}\n\nA body's center of gravity is the point around which the [[resultant force|resultant torque]] due to gravity forces vanishes. Where a gravity field can be considered to be uniform, the mass-center and the center-of-gravity will be the same.  However, for satellites in orbit around a planet, in the absence of other torques being applied to a satellite, the slight variation (gradient) in gravitational field between closer-to (stronger) and further-from (weaker) the planet can lead to a torque that will tend to align the satellite such that its long axis is vertical.  In such a case, it is important to make the distinction between the center-of-gravity and the mass-center.  Any horizontal offset between the two will result in an applied torque.\n\nIt is useful to note that the mass-center is a fixed property for a given rigid body (e.g. with no slosh or articulation), whereas the center-of-gravity may, in addition, depend upon its orientation in a non-uniform gravitational field.  In the latter case, the center-of-gravity will always be located somewhat closer to the main attractive body as compared to the mass-center, and thus will change its position in the body of interest as its orientation is changed.\n\nIn the study of the dynamics of aircraft, vehicles and vessels, forces and moments need to be resolved relative to the mass center. That is true independent of whether gravity itself is a consideration.  Referring to the mass-center as the center-of-gravity is something of a colloquialism, but it is in common usage and when gravity gradient effects are negligible, center-of-gravity and mass-center are the same and are used interchangeably.\n\nIn physics the benefits of using the center of mass to model a mass distribution can be seen by considering the [[resultant force|resultant]] of the gravity forces on a continuous body.  Consider a body Q of volume V with density \u03c1('''r''') at each point  '''r''' in the volume.  In a parallel gravity field the force '''f''' at each point '''r''' is given by,\n:<math> \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{r}) =  -dm\\, g\\vec{k}= -\\rho(\\mathbf{r})dV\\,g\\vec{k},</math>\nwhere dm is the mass at the point '''r''', g is the acceleration of gravity, and ''k'' is a unit vector defining the vertical direction.\nChoose a reference point '''R''' in the volume and compute the [[resultant force]] and torque at this point,\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} = \\iiint\\limits_{Q} \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{r})dV =  \\iiint\\limits_{Q}\\rho(\\mathbf{r})dV( -g\\vec{k}) = -Mg\\vec{k},</math>\nand\n:<math> \\mathbf{T} =  \\iiint\\limits_{Q} (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})\\times \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{r})dV = \\iiint\\limits_{Q} (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})\\times   (-g\\rho(\\mathbf{r})dV\\vec{k} )= \\left(\\iiint\\limits_{Q} \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})dV \\right)\\times   (-g\\vec{k}) .</math>\nIf the reference point '''R''' is chosen so that it is the center of mass, then\n:<math> \\iiint\\limits_{Q} \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})dV =0, </math>\nwhich means the resultant torque '''T'''=0.  Because the resultant torque is zero the body will move as though it is a particle with its mass concentrated at the center of mass.\n\nBy selecting the center of gravity as the reference point for a rigid body, the gravity forces will not cause the body to rotate, which means the weight of the body can be considered to be concentrated at the center of mass.\n\n==Linear and angular momentum==\nThe linear and angular momentum of a collection of particles can be simplified by measuring the position and velocity of the particles relative to the center of mass.  Let the system of particles ''P<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''=1,...,''n'' of masses ''m<sub>i</sub>'' be located at the coordinates '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> with velocities '''v'''<sub>''i''</sub>.  Select a reference point '''R''' and compute the relative position and velocity vectors,\n:<math> \\mathbf{r}_i = (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}) + \\mathbf{R}, \\quad \\mathbf{v}_i = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}) + \\mathbf{v}.</math>\nThe total linear and angular momentum vectors relative to the reference point '''R''' are\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R})\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\\right) \\mathbf{v},</math>\nand\n:<math> \\mathbf{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{R})\\times \\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}) + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{R})\\right)\\times\\mathbf{v}.</math>\n\nIf '''R''' is chosen as the center of mass these equations simplify to\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = m\\mathbf{v},\\quad \\mathbf{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{R})\\times \\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}),</math>\nwhere ''m'' is the total mass of all the particles, '''p''' is the linear momentum, and '''L''' is the angular momentum\n\nThe [[Conservation of momentum|Law of Conservation of Momentum]] predicts that for any system not subjected to external forces the momentum of the system will remain constant, which means the center of mass will move with constant velocity.  This applies for all systems with classical internal forces, including magnetic fields, electric fields, chemical reactions, and so on.

Thus, the center of mass of a circular cylinder of constant density has its center of mass on the axis of the cylinder.  In the same way, the center of mass of a spherically symmetric body of constant density is at the center of the sphere.

The barycenter is the point between two objects where they balance each other; it is the center of mass where two or more celestial bodies [[orbit]] each other. When a [[natural satellite|moon]] orbits a [[planet]], or a planet orbits a [[star]], both bodies are actually orbiting a point that lies away from the center of the primary (larger) body.{{sfn|Murray|Dermott|1999|pp=45\u201347}} For example, the Moon does not orbit the exact center of the [[Earth]], but a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon, approximately 1,710&nbsp;km (1,062&nbsp;miles) below the surface of the Earth, where their respective masses balance. This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the [[Sun]]. If the masses are more similar, e.g., [[Pluto#Charon|Pluto and Charon]], the barycenter will fall outside both bodies.\n\n=== Rigging and safety ===\nKnowing the location of the center of gravity when [[rigging (material handling)|rigging]] is crucial, possibly resulting in severe injury or death if assumed incorrectly.  A center of gravity that is at or above the lift point will most likely result in a tip-over incident.  In general, the further the center of gravity below the pick point, the more safe the lift.  There are other things to consider, such as shifting loads, strength of the load and mass, distance between pick points, and number of pick points.  Specifically, when selecting lift points, it's very important to place the center of gravity at the center and well below the lift points.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/usr/module4.pdf |title=Structural Collapse Technician: Module 4 - Lifting and Rigging |accessdate=27 November 2019 |website=FEMA.gov |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Body motion ===\n{{main|Kinesiology}}{{anchor|Kinesiology}}\nIn kinesiology and biomechanics, the center of mass is an important parameter that assists people in understanding their human locomotion.

This is the point to which a force may be applied to cause a [[linear acceleration]] without an [[angular acceleration]]. Calculations in [[mechanics]] are often simplified when formulated with respect to the center of mass. It is a hypothetical point where entire mass of an object may be assumed to be concentrated to visualise its motion. In other words, the center of mass is the particle equivalent of a given object for application of [[Newton's laws of motion]].\n\nIn the case of a single [[rigid body]], the center of mass is fixed in relation to the body, and if the body has uniform density, it will be located at the [[centroid]].  The center of mass may be located outside the physical body, as is sometimes the case for [[wikt:hollow|hollow]] or open-shaped objects, such as a [[horseshoe]].  In the case of a distribution of separate bodies, such as the [[planets]] of the [[Solar System]], the center of mass may not correspond to the position of any individual member of the system.\n\nThe center of mass is a useful reference point for calculations in [[mechanics]] that involve masses distributed in space, such as the [[momentum|linear]] and [[angular momentum]] of planetary bodies and [[rigid body dynamics]]. In [[orbital mechanics]], the equations of motion of planets are formulated as [[point mass]]es located at the centers of mass.  The [[center of mass frame]] is an [[inertial frame]] in which the center of mass of a system is at rest with respect to the origin of the coordinate system.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of \"center of mass\" in the form of the '''center of gravity''' was first introduced by the  great ancient Greek physicist, mathematician, and engineer [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]]. He worked with simplified assumptions about gravity that amount to a uniform field, thus arriving at the mathematical properties of what we now call the center of mass. Archimedes showed that the [[torque]] exerted on a [[lever]] by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point\u2014their center of mass. In work on floating bodies he demonstrated that the orientation of a floating object is the one that makes its center of mass as low as possible. He developed mathematical techniques for finding the centers of mass of objects of uniform density of various well-defined shapes.{{sfn|Shore|2008|pp=9\u201311}}\n\nLater mathematicians who developed the theory of the center of mass include [[Pappus of Alexandria]], [[Guido Ubaldi]], [[Francesco Maurolico]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=91\u201394}} [[Federico Commandino]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=94\u201396}} [[Simon Stevin]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=96\u2013101}} [[Luca Valerio]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=101\u2013106}} [[Jean-Charles de la Faille]], [[Paul Guldin]],{{sfn|Mancosu|1999|pp=56\u201361}} [[John Wallis]], [[Louis Carr\u00e9 (mathematician)|Louis Carr\u00e9]], [[Pierre Varignon]], and [[Alexis Clairaut]].{{sfn|Walton|1855|p=2}}\n\n[[Newton's second law]] is reformulated with respect to the center of mass in [[Euler's laws#Euler's first law|Euler's first law]].{{sfn|Beatty|2006|p=29}}\n[[File:CoG stable.svg|thumb|Diagram of an educational toy that balances on a point: the center of mass (C) settles below its support (P)]]\n<!---Please put this section back if you can revise it\n==Center of gravity==\nThe term \"center of mass\" is often used interchangeably with the term '''center of gravity''' because any uniform [[Newton's law of universal gravitation#Gravitational field|gravitational field]] '''g''' acts on a system as if the mass ''M'' of the system were concentrated at the center of mass '''R'''. The center of gravity is defined as the average position of weight distribution, and mass and weight are technically different properties. However, because weight and mass are proportional, the center of gravity and center of mass refer to the same point of an object for almost all objects on and near Earth's surface. Generally, physicists prefer to use the term ''center of mass'', as an object has a center of mass whether or not it is under the influence of gravity. In addition, the term \"center of gravity\" refers to the single point associated with an object where the force of [[Gravitation|gravity]] can be considered to act,\n\nSpecifically, the [[gravitational potential energy]] is equal to the potential energy of a point mass ''M'' at '''R''',{{sfn|Goldstein|Poole|Safko|2001|p=185}} and the gravitational [[torque]] is equal to the torque of a force ''M'''''g''' acting at '''R'''.{{sfn|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|p=19.3}} In a uniform gravitational field, the center of mass is a center of gravity, and in common usage, the two phrases are used as synonyms.\n\nIn a non-uniform field, gravitational effects such as [[potential energy]], [[force]], and [[torque]] can no longer be calculated using the center of mass alone. In particular, a non-uniform gravitational field can produce a torque on an object, causing it to rotate. The center of gravity, an application point of the [[resultant force|resultant]] gravitational force, may not exist or not be unique; see [[centers of gravity in non-uniform fields]].\n-->\n\n=={{anchor|Definition of center of mass}}Definition==\nThe center of mass is the unique point at the center of a distribution of mass in space that has the property that the weighted position vectors relative to this point sum to zero. In analogy to statistics, the center of mass is the mean location of a distribution of mass in space.\n\n===A system of particles===\nIn the case of a system of particles {{math|1=''P<sub>i</sub>'', ''i'' = 1,\u2009\u2026,\u2009''n''\u2009}}, each with mass {{mvar|m<sub>i</sub>}} that are located in space with coordinates {{math|1='''r'''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i'' = 1,\u2009\u2026,\u2009''n''\u2009}}, the coordinates '''R''' of the center of mass satisfy the condition\n:<math> \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}) = 0.</math>\nSolving this equation for '''R''' yields the formula\n:<math>\\mathbf{R} = \\frac 1M \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \\mathbf{r}_i,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|M}} is the sum of the masses of all of the particles.\n\n===A continuous volume===\nIf the mass distribution is continuous with the density \u03c1('''r''') within a solid ''Q'', then the integral of the weighted position coordinates of the points in this volume relative to the center of mass '''R''' over the volume '''V''' is zero, that is\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_{Q} \\rho(\\mathbf{r})(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})dV = 0.</math>\nSolve this equation for the coordinates '''R''' to obtain\n:<math>\\mathbf R = \\frac 1M \\iiint\\limits_{Q}\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\mathbf{r} dV,</math>\nwhere M is the total mass in the volume.\n\nIf a continuous mass distribution has uniform [[density]], which means \u03c1 is constant, then the center of mass is the same as the [[centroid]] of the volume.{{sfn|Levi|2009|p=85}}\n\n===Barycentric coordinates===\n{{further|Barycentric coordinate system}}\nThe coordinates '''R''' of the center of mass of a two-particle system, ''P<sub>1</sub>'' and ''P<sub>2</sub>'', with masses ''m<sub>1</sub>'' and ''m<sub>2</sub>'' is given by\n:<math> \\mathbf{R} = \\frac{1}{m_1+m_2}(m_1 \\mathbf{r}_1 + m_2\\mathbf{r}_2).</math>\nLet the percentage of the total mass divided between these two particles vary from 100% ''P<sub>1</sub>'' and 0% ''P<sub>2</sub>'' through 50% ''P<sub>1</sub>'' and 50% ''P<sub>2</sub>'' to 0% ''P<sub>1</sub>'' and 100% ''P<sub>2</sub>'', then the center of mass '''R''' moves along the line from ''P<sub>1</sub>'' to ''P<sub>2</sub>''.  The percentages of mass at each point can be viewed as projective coordinates of the point '''R''' on this line, and are termed barycentric coordinates. Another way of interpreting the process here is the mechanical balancing of moments about an arbitrary point. The numerator gives the total moment that is then balanced by an equivalent total force at the center of mass. This can be generalized to three points and four points to define projective coordinates in the plane, and in space, respectively.\n\n==={{anchor|Cluster straddling}}Systems with periodic boundary conditions===\nFor particles in a system with [[periodic boundary conditions]] two particles can be neighbours even though they are on opposite sides of the system. This occurs often in [[molecular dynamics]] simulations, for example, in which clusters form at random locations and sometimes neighbouring atoms cross the periodic boundary. When a cluster straddles the periodic boundary, a naive calculation of the center of mass will be incorrect. A generalized method for calculating the center of mass for periodic systems is to treat each coordinate, ''x'' and ''y'' and/or ''z'', as if it were on a circle instead of a line.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = Linge\n | last = Bai\n | author2=Breen, David\n | date = 2008\n | title = Calculating Center of Mass in an Unbounded 2D Environment\n | journal = Journal of Graphics, GPU, and Game Tools\n | volume = 13\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 53\u201360\n | doi =  10.1080/2151237X.2008.10129266\n }}</ref>\nThe calculation takes every particle's ''x'' coordinate and maps it to an angle,\n \n:<math>\\theta_i = \\frac{x_i}{x_{max}} 2 \\pi </math>\n \nwhere ''x''<sub>max</sub> is the system size in the ''x'' direction and <math>x_i\\in[0,x_{max})</math>. From this angle, two new points <math>(\\xi_i,\\zeta_i)</math> can be generated, which can be weighted by the mass of the particle <math>x_{i}</math> for the center of mass or given a value of 1 for the geometric center:\n \n:<math> \\xi_i = \\cos(\\theta_i)  </math> \n \n:<math> \\zeta_i = \\sin(\\theta_i) </math>\n \nIn the <math>(\\xi,\\zeta)</math> plane, these coordinates lie on a circle of radius 1.

The utility of the algorithm is that it allows the mathematics to determine where the \"best\" center of mass is, instead of guessing or using [[cluster analysis]] to \"unfold\" a cluster straddling the periodic boundaries. If both average values are zero, <math>(\\overline{\\xi},\\overline{\\zeta}) = (0,0)</math>, then <math>\\overline{\\theta}</math> is undefined. This is a correct result, because it only occurs when all particles are exactly evenly spaced. In that condition, their ''x'' coordinates are mathematically identical in a [[periodic boundary conditions#Practical implementation: continuity and the minimum image convention|periodic system]].\n\n==Center of gravity==\n{{redirect|Center of gravity}}\n{{main|Centers of gravity in non-uniform fields}}\n\nA body's center of gravity is the point around which the [[resultant force|resultant torque]] due to gravity forces vanishes. Where a gravity field can be considered to be uniform, the mass-center and the center-of-gravity will be the same.  However, for satellites in orbit around a planet, in the absence of other torques being applied to a satellite, the slight variation (gradient) in gravitational field between closer-to (stronger) and further-from (weaker) the planet can lead to a torque that will tend to align the satellite such that its long axis is vertical.  In such a case, it is important to make the distinction between the center-of-gravity and the mass-center.  Any horizontal offset between the two will result in an applied torque.\n\nIt is useful to note that the mass-center is a fixed property for a given rigid body (e.g. with no slosh or articulation), whereas the center-of-gravity may, in addition, depend upon its orientation in a non-uniform gravitational field.  In the latter case, the center-of-gravity will always be located somewhat closer to the main attractive body as compared to the mass-center, and thus will change its position in the body of interest as its orientation is changed.\n\nIn the study of the dynamics of aircraft, vehicles and vessels, forces and moments need to be resolved relative to the mass center. That is true independent of whether gravity itself is a consideration.  Referring to the mass-center as the center-of-gravity is something of a colloquialism, but it is in common usage and when gravity gradient effects are negligible, center-of-gravity and mass-center are the same and are used interchangeably.\n\nIn physics the benefits of using the center of mass to model a mass distribution can be seen by considering the [[resultant force|resultant]] of the gravity forces on a continuous body.  Consider a body Q of volume V with density \u03c1('''r''') at each point  '''r''' in the volume.  In a parallel gravity field the force '''f''' at each point '''r''' is given by,\n:<math> \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{r}) =  -dm\\, g\\vec{k}= -\\rho(\\mathbf{r})dV\\,g\\vec{k},</math>\nwhere dm is the mass at the point '''r''', g is the acceleration of gravity, and ''k'' is a unit vector defining the vertical direction.\nChoose a reference point '''R''' in the volume and compute the [[resultant force]] and torque at this point,\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} = \\iiint\\limits_{Q} \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{r})dV =  \\iiint\\limits_{Q}\\rho(\\mathbf{r})dV( -g\\vec{k}) = -Mg\\vec{k},</math>\nand\n:<math> \\mathbf{T} =  \\iiint\\limits_{Q} (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})\\times \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{r})dV = \\iiint\\limits_{Q} (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})\\times   (-g\\rho(\\mathbf{r})dV\\vec{k} )= \\left(\\iiint\\limits_{Q} \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})dV \\right)\\times   (-g\\vec{k}) .</math>\nIf the reference point '''R''' is chosen so that it is the center of mass, then\n:<math> \\iiint\\limits_{Q} \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})dV =0, </math>\nwhich means the resultant torque '''T'''=0.  Because the resultant torque is zero the body will move as though it is a particle with its mass concentrated at the center of mass.\n\nBy selecting the center of gravity as the reference point for a rigid body, the gravity forces will not cause the body to rotate, which means the weight of the body can be considered to be concentrated at the center of mass.\n\n==Linear and angular momentum==\nThe linear and angular momentum of a collection of particles can be simplified by measuring the position and velocity of the particles relative to the center of mass.  Let the system of particles ''P<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''=1,...,''n'' of masses ''m<sub>i</sub>'' be located at the coordinates '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> with velocities '''v'''<sub>''i''</sub>.  Select a reference point '''R''' and compute the relative position and velocity vectors,\n:<math> \\mathbf{r}_i = (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}) + \\mathbf{R}, \\quad \\mathbf{v}_i = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}) + \\mathbf{v}.</math>\nThe total linear and angular momentum vectors relative to the reference point '''R''' are\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R})\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\\right) \\mathbf{v},</math>\nand\n:<math> \\mathbf{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{R})\\times \\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}) + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{R})\\right)\\times\\mathbf{v}.</math>\n\nIf '''R''' is chosen as the center of mass these equations simplify to\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = m\\mathbf{v},\\quad \\mathbf{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{R})\\times \\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}),</math>\nwhere ''m'' is the total mass of all the particles, '''p''' is the linear momentum, and '''L''' is the angular momentum\n\nThe [[Conservation of momentum|Law of Conservation of Momentum]] predicts that for any system not subjected to external forces the momentum of the system will remain constant, which means the center of mass will move with constant velocity.  This applies for all systems with classical internal forces, including magnetic fields, electric fields, chemical reactions, and so on.  More formally, this is true for any internal forces that cancel in accordance with [[Newton's Third Law]].{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|p=117}}\n<!-- this section is redundant and may have some errors----\nThe total momentum for any system of particles is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{p}=m\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{cm},</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' indicates the total mass, and '''v'''<sub>cm</sub> is the velocity of the center of mass.{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|p=116}} This velocity can be computed by taking the time derivative of the position of the center of mass. An analogue to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second Law]] is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{cm},</math>\n\nwhere '''F''' indicates the sum of all external forces on the system, and '''a'''<sub>cm</sub> indicates the acceleration of the center of mass. It is this principle that gives precise expression to the intuitive notion that the system as a whole behaves like a mass of ''m'' placed at '''R'''.{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|p=117}}\n\nThe [[angular momentum]] vector for a system is equal to the angular momentum of all the particles around the center of mass, plus the angular momentum of the center of mass, as if it were a single particle of mass <math>M</math>:{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|p=262}}\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L}_\\mathrm{sys} = \\mathbf{L}_\\mathrm{cm} + \\mathbf{L}_\\mathrm{around\\,cm}.</math>\n\nThis is a corollary of the [[parallel axis theorem]].{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|p=252}}\n-->\n\n==Locating the center of mass==\n{{Main|Locating the center of mass}}\n[[File:Center gravity 2.svg|thumb|Plumb line method]]\nThe experimental determination of the center of mass of a body uses gravity forces on the body and relies on the fact that in the parallel gravity field near the surface of the earth the center of mass is the same as the center of gravity.\n\nThe center of mass of a body with an axis of symmetry and constant density must lie on this axis.  Thus, the center of mass of a circular cylinder of constant density has its center of mass on the axis of the cylinder.  In the same way, the center of mass of a spherically symmetric body of constant density is at the center of the sphere.  In general, for any symmetry of a body, its center of mass will be a fixed point of that symmetry.{{sfn|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|p=19.3}}\n\n===In two dimensions===\nAn experimental method for locating the center of mass is to suspend the object from two locations and to drop [[plumb line]]s from the suspension points.

In this case, one can subdivide the complex shape into simpler, more elementary shapes, whose centers of mass are easy to find. If the total mass and center of mass can be determined for each area, then the center of mass of the whole is the weighted average of the centers.{{sfn|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|pp=19.1\u201319.2}} This method can even work for objects with holes, which can be accounted for as negative masses.{{sfn|Hamill|2009|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nA direct development of the [[planimeter]] known as an integraph, or integerometer, can be used to establish the position of the [[centroid]] or center of mass of an irregular two-dimensional shape.

To ensure the aircraft is stable enough to be safe to fly, the center of mass must fall within specified limits. If the center of mass is ahead of the [[Center of gravity of an aircraft|forward limit]], the aircraft will be less maneuverable, possibly to the point of being unable to rotate for takeoff or flare for landing.{{sfn|Federal Aviation Administration|2007|p=1.4}} If the center of mass is behind the aft limit, the aircraft will be more maneuverable, but also less stable, and possibly unstable enough so as to be impossible to fly.

The barycenter is the point between two objects where they balance each other; it is the center of mass where two or more celestial bodies [[orbit]] each other. When a [[natural satellite|moon]] orbits a [[planet]], or a planet orbits a [[star]], both bodies are actually orbiting a point that lies away from the center of the primary (larger) body.{{sfn|Murray|Dermott|1999|pp=45\u201347}} For example, the Moon does not orbit the exact center of the [[Earth]], but a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon, approximately 1,710&nbsp;km (1,062&nbsp;miles) below the surface of the Earth, where their respective masses balance. This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the [[Sun]]. If the masses are more similar, e.g., [[Pluto#Charon|Pluto and Charon]], the barycenter will fall outside both bodies.\n\n=== Rigging and safety ===\nKnowing the location of the center of gravity when [[rigging (material handling)|rigging]] is crucial, possibly resulting in severe injury or death if assumed incorrectly.  A center of gravity that is at or above the lift point will most likely result in a tip-over incident.  In general, the further the center of gravity below the pick point, the more safe the lift.  There are other things to consider, such as shifting loads, strength of the load and mass, distance between pick points, and number of pick points.  Specifically, when selecting lift points, it's very important to place the center of gravity at the center and well below the lift points.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/usr/module4.pdf |title=Structural Collapse Technician: Module 4 - Lifting and Rigging |accessdate=27 November 2019 |website=FEMA.gov |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Body motion ===\n{{main|Kinesiology}}{{anchor|Kinesiology}}\nIn kinesiology and biomechanics, the center of mass is an important parameter that assists people in understanding their human locomotion.

However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person.

Brandon Reigg, Netflix's Vice Principal of Unscripted Content, stated, \"We think the show's combination of modern social media interaction and competition will captivate Netflix members around the world, in multiple languages, and we're delighted to partner with Studio Lambert and Motion to produce these three new local versions.\"<ref name=\"adaptation\">{{cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-adapt-uk-unscripted-sensation-the-circle-with-three-local-versions-for-countries-around-the-world|title=Netflix to Adapt UK Unscripted Sensation ''The Circle'' with Three Local Versions for Countries Around the World|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Netflix Media Center|location=Hollywood, California|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production == \n=== Casting ===\nIn an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Tim Harcourt, one of the executive producers for [[Studio Lambert]], stated that ''The Circle'' format and premise allowed the casting team to search for all different kinds of people.

The first eight players to enter were all predetermined and planned, but everything after that was all luck to whoever got on. Harcourt stated that the production team would decide who would be the right fit depending on who just left the game, acknowledging that with thirteen contestants, not all who were possible players end up on the show at all.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nJennifer Teixido was the casting director for ''The Circle France''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jennifer TEIXIDO |url=https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jenn-teixido |publisher=Linkedin |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenn Teixido \ud83c\udfac Directrice des castings @tf1 .

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n''The Circle France'' was filmed in December 2019, in the same [[Salford|Salford, England]] apartment building that was also used by [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version]]'s [[The Circle (American season 1)|first season]], the [[The Circle (British TV series)|British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]], and the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version's first season]].

However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person. Then, the day after a blocking, a video message is shown to the remaining players to reveal if they were real or fake.<ref name=\"polygon\"/>\n\nDuring the finale, the contestants rate each other one final time, where the highest rated player wins the game and [[Euro|\u20ac]]100,000 ({{USD|110000}}).<ref name=\"trailer\"/>\n\n== Players ==\nThe players were selected from the \"20\u201325 individuals\" being cleared to appear on the show, with the remaining people never leaving standby status and not appearing on the show.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first nine players were revealed on ''The Circle France''{{'}}s [[Instagram]] profile.<ref>{{cite web |author1=@circlegame |title=Qui d'autre ne peut pas attendre! \ud83d\ude4c regardez les joueurs entrer dans The Circle Tomorrow sur @NetflixFR |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-tq9EsAU9X/ |website=instagram.com |publisher=Instagram |accessdate=8 April 2020 |date=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The players' profiles were revealed as they introduced themselves on-screen during an episode.<ref name=\"insider\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.craveyoutv.com/exclusive-interview-whats-next-for-best-friend-bill-from-the-circle/|title=Exclusive Interview: What's Next for Best Friend Bill from 'The Circle'|last=Buczak|first=Lizzy|date=2020-02-25|website=CraveyouTV TV Show Recaps, TV Reviews, Spoilers, Interviews|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Brandon Reigg, Netflix's Vice Principal of Unscripted Content, stated, \"We think the show's combination of modern social media interaction and competition will captivate Netflix members around the world, in multiple languages, and we're delighted to partner with Studio Lambert and Motion to produce these three new local versions.\"<ref name=\"adaptation\">{{cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-adapt-uk-unscripted-sensation-the-circle-with-three-local-versions-for-countries-around-the-world|title=Netflix to Adapt UK Unscripted Sensation ''The Circle'' with Three Local Versions for Countries Around the World|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Netflix Media Center|location=Hollywood, California|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production == \n=== Casting ===\nIn an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Tim Harcourt, one of the executive producers for [[Studio Lambert]], stated that ''The Circle'' format and premise allowed the casting team to search for all different kinds of people. He noted how the casting contrasted from casts on show like ''[[Real Housewives]]'' or ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' and how those shows are \"all one gang of quite similar characters.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> He explained how there was no set cast for the show until it was over. The first eight players to enter were all predetermined and planned, but everything after that was all luck to whoever got on. Harcourt stated that the production team would decide who would be the right fit depending on who just left the game, acknowledging that with thirteen contestants, not all who were possible players end up on the show at all.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nJennifer Teixido was the casting director for ''The Circle France''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jennifer TEIXIDO |url=https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jenn-teixido |publisher=Linkedin |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenn Teixido \ud83c\udfac Directrice des castings @tf1 .

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n''The Circle France'' was filmed in December 2019, in the same [[Salford|Salford, England]] apartment building that was also used by [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version]]'s [[The Circle (American season 1)|first season]], the [[The Circle (British TV series)|British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]], and the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version's first season]].
