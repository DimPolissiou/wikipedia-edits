Historically, Primates of particular sees were granted privileges including the authority to call and preside at national [[synod]]s, jurisdiction to hear appeals from [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] tribunals, the right to crown the sovereign of the nation, and presiding at the [[investiture]] (installation) of archbishops in their sees.<ref name=ce>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Primate}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Template-Patriarch (Latin_Rite) - Primate.svg|left|thumb|Catholic Primate (non-cardinal) coat of arms]]\nThe office is generally found only in older Catholic countries, and is now purely honorific, enjoying no effective powers under [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]\u2014except for the [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] (Gran) in Hungary.<ref name=ce/> Thus, e.g., the [[Primate of Poland]] holds no jurisdictional authority over other Polish bishops or their dioceses, but is ''durante munere'' a member of the standing committee of the episcopal conference and has honorary precedence among Polish bishops (e.g., in liturgical ceremonies).

As chief Metropolitan, he occupies a position similar to that of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England\" ({{CathEncy|wstitle=Archdiocese of Westminster}}). \"By the grant in the [[Apostolic Constitution]] of 'certain new distinctions of preeminence', for the preservation of unity in government and policy, to the Archbishop of Westminster for the time being, comprised under the following three heads: He will be permanent chairman of the meetings of the Bishops of all England and Wales, and for this reason it will be for him to summon these meetings and to preside over them, according to the rules in force in Italy and elsewhere. (2) He will take rank above the other two Archbishops, and will throughout all England and Wales enjoy the privilege of wearing the [[Pallium]], of occupying the throne, and of having the cross borne before him. (3) Lastly, in all dealings with the Supreme Civil Authority, he will in his person represent the entire Episcopate of England and Wales. Always, however, he is to take the opinion of all the Bishops, and to be guided by the votes of the major part of them'.

The loose structure of the Benedictine Confederation is claimed to have made [[Pope Leo XIII]] exclaim that the Benedictines were ''ordo sine ordine'' (\"an order without order\").  The powers of the [[Abbot]] Primate are specified, and his position defined, in a decree of the [[Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars]] dated 16 September 1893. The primacy is attached to the global [[Benedictine Confederation]] whose Primate resides at [[Sant'Anselmo]] in [[Rome]]. He takes precedence of all other abbots, is empowered to pronounce on all doubtful matters of discipline, to settle difficulties arising between monasteries, to hold a canonical visitation, if necessary, in any congregation of the order, and to exercise a general supervision for the regular observance of monastic discipline. The Primatial powers are only vested in the Abbot Primate to act by virtue of the proper law of its autonomous Benedictine congregation, which at the present is minimal to none. However, certain branches of the Benedictine Order seem to have lost their original autonomy to some extent.\n \nIn a similar way the Confederation of [[Canons Regular of St. Augustine]], elects an Abbot Primate as figurehead of the Confederation and indeed the whole Canonical Order. The Abbots and Superiors General of the nine congregations of confederated congregations of [[Canons Regular]] elect a new Abbot Primate for a term of office lasting six years. The Current Abbot Primate is Rt Rev. Fr Jean-Michel Girard, CRB, Abbot General of the Canons Regular of the Grand St Bernard.\n\n== Anglicanism ==\nAnglican usage styles the bishop who heads an independent church as its \"primate\", though commonly they hold some other title (e.g. archbishop, presiding bishop, or moderator). The primates' authority within their churches varies considerably: some churches give the primate some executive authority, while in others they may do no more than preside over church councils and represent the church ceremonially.\n\n===Anglican Communion===\n{{Main|Primates in the Anglican Communion}}\nIn the context of the [[Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting]], the chief [[bishop]] of each of the thirty-nine churches (also known as provinces) that compose the [[Anglican Communion]] acts as its primate, though this title may not necessarily be used within their own provinces. Thus the [[United Church]]es of Bangladesh, of North India, of Pakistan and of South India, which are united with other originally non-Anglican churches, are represented at the meetings by their moderators.<ref name=AC>[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/communion/primates/definition.cfm Anglican Communion: \"What Is a Primate?\"]</ref>\n\nIn both the [[Church of England]] and the [[Church of Ireland]], two bishops have the title of primate: the archbishops of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]] in England and of [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Armagh]] and [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Dublin]] in Ireland. Only the bishop of the senior primatial see of each of these two churches participates in the meetings.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, who is considered ''[[primus inter pares]]'' of all the participants, convokes the meetings and issues the invitations.<ref name=AC/>\n\nPrimates and archbishops are styled \"The Most Reverend\".

As chief Metropolitan, he occupies a position similar to that of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England\" ({{CathEncy|wstitle=Archdiocese of Westminster}}). \"By the grant in the [[Apostolic Constitution]] of 'certain new distinctions of preeminence', for the preservation of unity in government and policy, to the Archbishop of Westminster for the time being, comprised under the following three heads: He will be permanent chairman of the meetings of the Bishops of all England and Wales, and for this reason it will be for him to summon these meetings and to preside over them, according to the rules in force in Italy and elsewhere. (2) He will take rank above the other two Archbishops, and will throughout all England and Wales enjoy the privilege of wearing the [[Pallium]], of occupying the throne, and of having the cross borne before him. (3) Lastly, in all dealings with the Supreme Civil Authority, he will in his person represent the entire Episcopate of England and Wales. Always, however, he is to take the opinion of all the Bishops, and to be guided by the votes of the major part of them'.

Functions can sometimes be exercised in practice (''[[de facto]]''), as by a ''de facto'' government, without having been granted by law; but since \"Primate\" is today a title, not a function, there is no such thing as a \"''de facto''\" primate.\n\nThe pre-reformation  Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Nidaros|Archbishop of Nidaros]] was sometimes referred to as Primate of Norway,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://old.fortidsminneforeningen.no/properties/59/111 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714131504/http://old.fortidsminneforeningen.no/properties/59/111 |archive-date=2014-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> even though it is unlikely that this title ever was officially granted to him by the Holy See.\n\n=== Catholic Primatial sees ===\nThe heads of certain [[episcopal see|sees]] have at times been referred to, at least by themselves,<ref name=Dainville>[[Fran\u00e7ois de Dainville]].

The loose structure of the Benedictine Confederation is claimed to have made [[Pope Leo XIII]] exclaim that the Benedictines were ''ordo sine ordine'' (\"an order without order\").  The powers of the [[Abbot]] Primate are specified, and his position defined, in a decree of the [[Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars]] dated 16 September 1893. The primacy is attached to the global [[Benedictine Confederation]] whose Primate resides at [[Sant'Anselmo]] in [[Rome]]. He takes precedence of all other abbots, is empowered to pronounce on all doubtful matters of discipline, to settle difficulties arising between monasteries, to hold a canonical visitation, if necessary, in any congregation of the order, and to exercise a general supervision for the regular observance of monastic discipline. The Primatial powers are only vested in the Abbot Primate to act by virtue of the proper law of its autonomous Benedictine congregation, which at the present is minimal to none. However, certain branches of the Benedictine Order seem to have lost their original autonomy to some extent.\n \nIn a similar way the Confederation of [[Canons Regular of St. Augustine]], elects an Abbot Primate as figurehead of the Confederation and indeed the whole Canonical Order. The Abbots and Superiors General of the nine congregations of confederated congregations of [[Canons Regular]] elect a new Abbot Primate for a term of office lasting six years. The Current Abbot Primate is Rt Rev. Fr Jean-Michel Girard, CRB, Abbot General of the Canons Regular of the Grand St Bernard.\n\n== Anglicanism ==\nAnglican usage styles the bishop who heads an independent church as its \"primate\", though commonly they hold some other title (e.g. archbishop, presiding bishop, or moderator). The primates' authority within their churches varies considerably: some churches give the primate some executive authority, while in others they may do no more than preside over church councils and represent the church ceremonially.\n\n===Anglican Communion===\n{{Main|Primates in the Anglican Communion}}\nIn the context of the [[Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting]], the chief [[bishop]] of each of the thirty-nine churches (also known as provinces) that compose the [[Anglican Communion]] acts as its primate, though this title may not necessarily be used within their own provinces. Thus the [[United Church]]es of Bangladesh, of North India, of Pakistan and of South India, which are united with other originally non-Anglican churches, are represented at the meetings by their moderators.<ref name=AC>[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/communion/primates/definition.cfm Anglican Communion: \"What Is a Primate?\"]</ref>\n\nIn both the [[Church of England]] and the [[Church of Ireland]], two bishops have the title of primate: the archbishops of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]] in England and of [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Armagh]] and [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Dublin]] in Ireland. Only the bishop of the senior primatial see of each of these two churches participates in the meetings.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, who is considered ''[[primus inter pares]]'' of all the participants, convokes the meetings and issues the invitations.<ref name=AC/>\n\nPrimates and archbishops are styled \"The Most Reverend\".

The Project was supported by private foundations, book lovers and from the sale of facsimile copies. Over half a million pages were filmed from thousands of rare and out-of-print Hebrew works.\n\nThe recent digital book revolution started by [[Google Books]] actually started over 15 years in the Jewish World using hard drives and CDs.

The Otzrot HaTorah project, the Otzar HaHochma project and Hebrewbooks.org are a few examples of book scanners who have scanned together over 40,000 volumes of Hebraica and Rabbinics.

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and another wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows, and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls, and other rare birds. Ashy Dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar Shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharashtra & former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician \u2013 and much more \u2013 who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi.

A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and another wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows, and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls, and other rare birds. Ashy Dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar Shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharashtra & former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician \u2013 and much more \u2013 who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi. A Cambridge-educated lawyer, he had been on the watch list of British authorities during his days in Britain and upon his return to India, got involved in cooperative movements and public life in general. His legal battles in the courts are legendary)Rajni Patel's widow Bakul Patel was a former Sheriff of Mumbai. More down the road on the hill is BSES Niwas, a property now being developed for and by [[Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group|Reliance ADAG]]now Adnani. lying adjacent is the Reservoir at 'The Top Of The Hill' holding and supplying Water to the residents of both sides of the Hill. Further down the southern slopes of the hill resided the Late Nargis Dutt and her husband the late Sunil Dutt, the two besides been thespians were also connected politically Mr. Sunil Dutt, a politician, after he joined the Indian National Congress party, he had the unique distinction of getting elected to the Parliament of India for five terms from the Mumbai North West constituency.\nOn the bend is the Residence of the famous Dilip Kumar whose thespian wife Saira Banu lives therein.\n\nDown towards Union Park & Golf Links at the North end of the hill is the residence of the former chief minister of Maharashtra Mr. Narayan Rane.\nThe Golf Course today is no more, it is filed by high rise buildings overseeing the nets of The \"Danda' fishing Village.\n\nOther landmarks include Kangaroo Kids Nursery and Playschool, Juice Salon, Sundaram Stores, cozy home apartments. At Union Park lies Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls' High School.\ndown the slope on the eastern side is the Pali Market, now under reconstruction.\nIn the 19th Century, Pali Hill was called Pakhari HIll\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2016}}\n* President of The Indian Music Industry & Phonographic Performance Ltd. and Ex-Chairman of Polygram Music Ltd. and Universal Music India, Vijay Lazarus;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indianmi.org/newsletter/August%201/The%20President's%20Desk.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018013738/http://www.indianmi.org/newsletter/August%201/The%20President's%20Desk.html |archive-date=18 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[[Indian Music Industry]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioandmusic.com/biz/music/representative-bodies/imi/imi-president-vijay-lazarus-differences-radio-industry-need-be-bridged|title=IMI president Vijay Lazarus - Differences with the radio industry need to be bridged|website=www.radioandmusic.com}}</ref>\n* Late politician and actor, [[Sunil Dutt]]'s bungalow, as well as his daughter and Member of Parliament [[Priya Dutt]]'s and her brother [[Sanjay Dutt]]'s building;\n*[[Kripashankar Singh]] EX- Home Minister of Maharashtra, Presidents of [[Mumbai Regional Congress Committee|Mumbai Congress]], & MLA From [[Kalina (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Kalina]] \n* [[Kumar Gaurav]] of Love Story fame\n* Actor [[Dilip Kumar]]'s and [[Saira Banu]]'s bungalow (currently caught in a heritage structure row and in a semi-ruin state);<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/We-dont-want-Bollywood-in-our-backyard/articleshow/16119072.cms|title=We don't want Bollywood in our backyard|last=Apr 18|first=Updated|last2=2011|website=Mumbai Mirror|language=en|access-date=2019-07-31|last3=Ist|first3=02:40}}</ref>\n* Film personality Nasir's Hussain's bungalow \u2013 Pali Annexe (now being renovated); with grandson [[Imran Khan (Bollywood actor)|Imran Khan]]\n* [[Rajendranath Zutshi]] at Summer Palace\n* [[Aamir Khan]]'s flat at Belavista and [[Faisal Khan]] at Marina Apartments near the Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls' High School at Union Park;\n* Film maker and director [[Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra]]'s bungalow \u2013 Mamta\n* [[Gulzar]], poet, lyricist, writer, at his bungalow Boskiyana\n* [[Gulshan Bawra]], lyricist<ref name=down>{{cite web |title=Down the memory lane with Gulshan Bawra |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2007/07/09/2839/index.html |date=9 July 2007 |publisher=Screen Weekly }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* [[Rishi Kapoor]], his wife [[Neetu Kapoor]] at the bungalow Krishna Raj\n*[[Ranbir Kapoor]] at Vastu Apartment with [[Alia Bhatt]]\n* [[Narayan Rane]] at Gautam Apartments\n* Actors [[Sanjeev Kumar]] near Petit School \n* [[Prem Chopra]], [[Moushmi Chatterjee]], [[Vinod Mehra]] and others\n* [[Anil Dhawan]], at Nibbana Apartments; \n* [[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]] and his family\n* Actor [[Pran (actor)|Pran]] and other eminent Film production icons\n* [[Mahesh Bhatt]] and [[Pooja Bhatt]] who used to stay at Green Acres\n* Models [[Tapur Chatterjee]] and [[Kirat Bhattal]] \n* [[Anna Singh]], fashion designer\n* [[Sameer Pitalwalla]], CEO of [[Culture Machine]]\n* [[Haresh Chawla]], CEO of [[CNBC-TV18]]\n* [[Kunal Kapoor]], film director\n* [[Emraan Hashmi]], Bollywood Actor; at Nibhana\n* [[Asha Sachdev]] at Sunset Heights\n* [[A.M.

The model 92 was designed in 1975 and production of many variants in different calibers continues today.\n\nThe [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] replaced the [[M1911A1]] [[.45 ACP]] pistol in 1985 with the Beretta 92FS, designated as the [[Beretta M9|'''M9''']].\n\n==History==\nThe Beretta 92 pistol evolved from earlier Beretta designs, most notably the [[Beretta M1923|M1923]] and [[Beretta M1951|M1951]]. From the M1923 comes the open [[Pistol slide|slide]] design, while the alloy [[Receiver (firearms)|frame]] and locking block [[gun barrel|barrel]], originally from [[Walther P38]], were first used in the M1951. The grip angle and the front sight integrated with the slide were also common to earlier Beretta pistols. What were perhaps the Model 92's two most important advanced design features had first appeared on its immediate predecessor, the 1974 .380 caliber [[Beretta Cheetah|Model 84]]. These improvements both involved the magazine, which featured direct feed; that is, there was no feed ramp between the magazine and the chamber (a Beretta innovation in pistols). In addition, the magazine was a \"double-stacked\" design, a feature originally introduced in 1935 on the [[Browning Hi-Power]].<ref>Gangarosa, Gene Jr., \"Modern Beretta Firearms\", Stoeger Publishing (1994)</ref>\n\nCarlo Beretta, Giuseppe Mazzetti and Vittorio Valle, all experienced firearms designers, contributed to the final design in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berettaweb.com/92%20Successo/Beretta%2092%20a%20global%20success%201a.htm|title=Beretta Web - 92FS 15 years of evolution and success|accessdate=25 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808040443/http://www.berettaweb.com/92%20Successo/Beretta%2092%20a%20global%20success%201a.htm|archive-date=8 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution===\n\n====92====\nProduction began in May 1976, and ended in February 1983.

This resulted in the '''92S''', which was adopted by several Italian law enforcement and military units.  The magazine release button is at the bottom of the grip as is customary in Europe. This model was produced from 1978 - 1982.\n\n====92SB (92S-1)====\nThe 92SB, initially called '''92S-1''', was specifically designed for the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] trials (which it won), the model name officially adopted was the '''92SB'''. Features added include a [[firing pin block]] (thus the addition of the \"B\" to the name), ambidextrous safety levers, [[Iron sights#Contrast enhancements|3-dot sights]], and relocated the magazine release catch from the bottom of the grip to the lower bottom of the trigger guard. The later relocation of the magazine release button means preceding models (92 & 92S) cannot necessarily use later magazines, unless they have notches in both areas.<ref name=\"Ayoob2011\">{{cite book |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |authorlink=Massad Ayoob |title=Gun Digest Book of Beretta Pistols: Function / Accuracy / Performance |year=2011 |publisher=Gun Digest Books |location=Iola, Wisconsin |isbn=1-4402-2424-2 |pages=59\u201360}}</ref>\n\nA compact version with a shortened barrel and slide and 13-round magazine capacity known as the '''92SB Compact''' was manufactured from 1981 to 1991.<ref name=\"Ayoob2011\"/>\n\n====92F (92SB-F)====\nBeretta modified the model 92SB slightly to create the 92SB-F (the \"F\" added to denote entry of the model in U.S. Government federal testing) by making the following changes:\n\n* Design of all the parts to make them 100% interchangeable to simplify maintenance for large government organizations.\n* Squared off the front of the trigger guard so that one could use finger support for easier aiming.\n* Recurved the forward base of the grip to aid aiming.\n* [[Hard chromed]] the bore to protect it from corrosion and to reduce wear.\n* New surface coating on the slide called ''Bruniton'', which allegedly provides better corrosion resistance than the previous plain [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] finish.<ref name=\"Thompson2012\"/>{{rp|16}}\n\n[[File:Beretta92FS vector.svg|thumb|right|Vector-graphic of model 92FS]]\n[[File:Beretta 92FS (right).jpg|thumb|right|A Beretta 92FS Inox with the slide retracted, showing the exposed ejection port and barrel mechanism.]]\n[[File:Beretta 92FS left.jpg|thumb|A Beretta 92FS Inox stainless steel pistol.]]\n\nThe French military adopted a modified version of the 92F with a decocking-only lever as the '''PAMAS G1'''. These pistols have [[tellurium]] in the [[pistol slide|slide]], making the steel brittle and as such only have a service life of approximately 6,000 rounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/PAMAS_G1_pistol|title=PAMAS G1 pistol - ARRSEpedia|website=www.arrse.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063000/https://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/PAMAS_G1_pistol|archive-date=2018-02-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====92FS====\n{{see also|Beretta M9}}\n\nThe FS has an enlarged hammer pin that fits into a groove on the underside of the slide. The main purpose is to stop the slide from flying off the frame to the rear if it cracks. This was in response to reported defective slides during U.S. military testing.<ref name=\"LawrencePannone2015\">{{cite book |last1=Lawrence |first1=Erik |last2=Pannone |first2=Mike |title=Beretta 92FS/M9 Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcG7BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT10|date=19 February 2015 |publisher=Erik Lawrence Publications |isbn=978-1-941998-55-7 |page=10}}</ref>\nThe 92FS also came in a Centurion model which featured a shorter barrel that just clears it's full size frame.\n\n==Design==\n\nThe Beretta 92's open slide design ensures smooth feeding and ejection of ammunition and allows easy clearing of obstructions. The hard-chromed barrel bore reduces barrel wear and protects it from corrosion. The falling locking block design provides good accuracy and operability with suppressors due to the in-line travel of the barrel. This is in contrast to the complex travel of [[John Browning|Browning]] designed barrels. The magazine release button is reversible with simple field tools. Reversing the magazine release makes left-handed operation much easier.\n\nIncreasingly, it has become popular to reduce handgun weight and cost as well as increase corrosion resistance by using polymers. Starting around the year 2000, Beretta began replacing some parts with polymer and polymer coated metal. Polymer parts include the recoil spring guide rod (which is now also fluted), magazine floor plate, magazine follower and the mainspring cap/lanyard loop. Polymer coated metal parts include the left side safety lever, trigger, and magazine release button.<ref name=\"Ayoob2007\">{{cite book|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|title=The Gun Digest Book of Combat Handgunnery|date=28 September 2007|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1825-0|page=218}}</ref>\n\n===Magazines===\nTo keep in line with the introduction of laws in some locations restricting magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, Beretta now manufactures magazines that hold fewer than the factory standard 15 rounds. These magazines have heavier crimping (deeper indentations in the side) to reduce the available space while still keeping the same external dimensions and ensuring that these magazines can be used on existing firearms. Beretta also produces 15 round \"Sand Resistant\" magazines to resolve issues encountered with contractor made magazines, and 17 round magazines included with the A1 models. Both magazines function in earlier 92 series and M9 model pistols.\n\nItalian magazine manufacturer Mec-Gar now produces magazines in blue and nickel finishes with an 18-round capacity, which fit flush in the magazine well on the 92 series. Mec-Gar also produces an extended 20-round blued magazine that protrudes below the frame by {{convert|3/4|in}}. These magazines provide users in unrestricted states with a larger capacity magazine.\n\n==Variants==\n\nThe Beretta 92 is available in many configurations and models:\n\n[[File:DCB-Shooting MAS G1S.jpg|thumb|right|The French-made PAMAS G1 variant.]]\n\n===Models===\n;92D : The 92D is a double action only variant of the 92FS with no safety or decocking lever. \n\n[[File:Beretta 92 Compact L PDRM.jpg|thumb|right|Beretta 92 Compact L owned by the Royal Malaysia Police.]]\n\n;Vertec : (2001-2007, 2014-2018) \n:The Vertec is a variant of the 92-series with a recountoured, straight backstrap, removable sights, 1-slot accessory rail, flared magwell, and 4.7 inch barrel\n\n;[[Beretta 90two|90Two]] : (2006-2012) \n:The 90two is a 9mm/.40 variant of the 92-series with a redesigned, thicker slide and frame to accommodate an accessory rail, fully [[dovetail]]ed front sight and .40 S&W pressures.

Similar to the M9A3, it features a 3-slot Picatinny rail, thinner vertical grip, removable wrap-around grips that can be swapped between Vertec-style and 'old' M9 style, fully removable sights (High visibility orange dot) and a universal slide, which makes the gun convertible from decocker-safety to decocker-only mode. Unlike the M9a3, the barrel is not threaded. The 92x series comes in compact, centurion, and full size variants.\n\n;92x Performance: (2019\u2013present)\n: The 92x Performance was introduced in 2019, alongside the 92x as a competition pistol. Similar to the 92x, it features a 3-slot Picatinny rail, thinner vertical grip, removable wrap-around grips that can be swapped between Vertec-style and 'old' M9 style, dovetailed sights. The 92x Performance however includes a red fiberoptic front sight, adjustable rear sight, front and rear slide serrations, skeletonized hammer, competition hammer spring, steel spring recoil rod, extended beavertail, front and rear frame checkering, oversized magazine release, and match take down lever. The Vertec frame is made of steel rather than alloy, increasing the weight to 48 ounces. The 92x Performance utilizes a frame mounted safety compared to the slide mounted safety of the standard 92x. The Extreme-S trigger mechanism is utilized in the handgun, reducing trigger reset by 40%. The trigger is adjustable for pre-travel (in single action only models), as well as overtravel (in all models).\n\n===93R machine pistol===\n{{main|Beretta 93R}}\nThe Beretta 93R is a significantly redesigned 92 to provide the option of firing in three-round bursts.

The model 92 was designed in 1975 and production of many variants in different calibers continues today.\n\nThe [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] replaced the [[M1911A1]] [[.45 ACP]] pistol in 1985 with the Beretta 92FS, designated as the [[Beretta M9|'''M9''']].\n\n==History==\nThe Beretta 92 pistol evolved from earlier Beretta designs, most notably the [[Beretta M1923|M1923]] and [[Beretta M1951|M1951]]. From the M1923 comes the open [[Pistol slide|slide]] design, while the alloy [[Receiver (firearms)|frame]] and locking block [[gun barrel|barrel]], originally from [[Walther P38]], were first used in the M1951. The grip angle and the front sight integrated with the slide were also common to earlier Beretta pistols. What were perhaps the Model 92's two most important advanced design features had first appeared on its immediate predecessor, the 1974 .380 caliber [[Beretta Cheetah|Model 84]]. These improvements both involved the magazine, which featured direct feed; that is, there was no feed ramp between the magazine and the chamber (a Beretta innovation in pistols). In addition, the magazine was a \"double-stacked\" design, a feature originally introduced in 1935 on the [[Browning Hi-Power]].<ref>Gangarosa, Gene Jr., \"Modern Beretta Firearms\", Stoeger Publishing (1994)</ref>\n\nCarlo Beretta, Giuseppe Mazzetti and Vittorio Valle, all experienced firearms designers, contributed to the final design in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berettaweb.com/92%20Successo/Beretta%2092%20a%20global%20success%201a.htm|title=Beretta Web - 92FS 15 years of evolution and success|accessdate=25 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808040443/http://www.berettaweb.com/92%20Successo/Beretta%2092%20a%20global%20success%201a.htm|archive-date=8 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution===\n\n====92====\nProduction began in May 1976, and ended in February 1983. Approximately 7,000 units were of the first \"step slide\" design and 45,000 were of the second \"straight slide\" type.<ref name=\"Wilson2000\">{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert Lawrence|title=The World of Beretta: An International Legend|year=2000|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-375-50149-4|pages=207, 234}}</ref>\n\n====92S====\nIn order to meet requirements of some law enforcement agencies, Beretta modified the Beretta 92 by adding a slide-mounted combined safety and decocking lever, replacing the frame mounted manual thumb safety. This resulted in the '''92S''', which was adopted by several Italian law enforcement and military units.  The magazine release button is at the bottom of the grip as is customary in Europe. This model was produced from 1978 - 1982.\n\n====92SB (92S-1)====\nThe 92SB, initially called '''92S-1''', was specifically designed for the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] trials (which it won), the model name officially adopted was the '''92SB'''. Features added include a [[firing pin block]] (thus the addition of the \"B\" to the name), ambidextrous safety levers, [[Iron sights#Contrast enhancements|3-dot sights]], and relocated the magazine release catch from the bottom of the grip to the lower bottom of the trigger guard.

These pistols have [[tellurium]] in the [[pistol slide|slide]], making the steel brittle and as such only have a service life of approximately 6,000 rounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/PAMAS_G1_pistol|title=PAMAS G1 pistol - ARRSEpedia|website=www.arrse.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063000/https://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/PAMAS_G1_pistol|archive-date=2018-02-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====92FS====\n{{see also|Beretta M9}}\n\nThe FS has an enlarged hammer pin that fits into a groove on the underside of the slide. The main purpose is to stop the slide from flying off the frame to the rear if it cracks. This was in response to reported defective slides during U.S. military testing.<ref name=\"LawrencePannone2015\">{{cite book |last1=Lawrence |first1=Erik |last2=Pannone |first2=Mike |title=Beretta 92FS/M9 Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcG7BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT10|date=19 February 2015 |publisher=Erik Lawrence Publications |isbn=978-1-941998-55-7 |page=10}}</ref>\nThe 92FS also came in a Centurion model which featured a shorter barrel that just clears it's full size frame.\n\n==Design==\n\nThe Beretta 92's open slide design ensures smooth feeding and ejection of ammunition and allows easy clearing of obstructions. The hard-chromed barrel bore reduces barrel wear and protects it from corrosion. The falling locking block design provides good accuracy and operability with suppressors due to the in-line travel of the barrel. This is in contrast to the complex travel of [[John Browning|Browning]] designed barrels. The magazine release button is reversible with simple field tools. Reversing the magazine release makes left-handed operation much easier.\n\nIncreasingly, it has become popular to reduce handgun weight and cost as well as increase corrosion resistance by using polymers. Starting around the year 2000, Beretta began replacing some parts with polymer and polymer coated metal. Polymer parts include the recoil spring guide rod (which is now also fluted), magazine floor plate, magazine follower and the mainspring cap/lanyard loop. Polymer coated metal parts include the left side safety lever, trigger, and magazine release button.<ref name=\"Ayoob2007\">{{cite book|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|title=The Gun Digest Book of Combat Handgunnery|date=28 September 2007|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=1-4402-1825-0|page=218}}</ref>\n\n===Magazines===\nTo keep in line with the introduction of laws in some locations restricting magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, Beretta now manufactures magazines that hold fewer than the factory standard 15 rounds. These magazines have heavier crimping (deeper indentations in the side) to reduce the available space while still keeping the same external dimensions and ensuring that these magazines can be used on existing firearms. Beretta also produces 15 round \"Sand Resistant\" magazines to resolve issues encountered with contractor made magazines, and 17 round magazines included with the A1 models. Both magazines function in earlier 92 series and M9 model pistols.\n\nItalian magazine manufacturer Mec-Gar now produces magazines in blue and nickel finishes with an 18-round capacity, which fit flush in the magazine well on the 92 series. Mec-Gar also produces an extended 20-round blued magazine that protrudes below the frame by {{convert|3/4|in}}. These magazines provide users in unrestricted states with a larger capacity magazine.\n\n==Variants==\n\nThe Beretta 92 is available in many configurations and models:\n\n[[File:DCB-Shooting MAS G1S.jpg|thumb|right|The French-made PAMAS G1 variant.]]\n\n===Models===\n;92D : The 92D is a double action only variant of the 92FS with no safety or decocking lever. \n\n[[File:Beretta 92 Compact L PDRM.jpg|thumb|right|Beretta 92 Compact L owned by the Royal Malaysia Police.]]\n\n;Vertec : (2001-2007, 2014-2018) \n:The Vertec is a variant of the 92-series with a recountoured, straight backstrap, removable sights, 1-slot accessory rail, flared magwell, and 4.7 inch barrel\n\n;[[Beretta 90two|90Two]] : (2006-2012) \n:The 90two is a 9mm/.40 variant of the 92-series with a redesigned, thicker slide and frame to accommodate an accessory rail, fully [[dovetail]]ed front sight and .40 S&W pressures.

The 92x Performance however includes a red fiberoptic front sight, adjustable rear sight, front and rear slide serrations, skeletonized hammer, competition hammer spring, steel spring recoil rod, extended beavertail, front and rear frame checkering, oversized magazine release, and match take down lever. The Vertec frame is made of steel rather than alloy, increasing the weight to 48 ounces. The 92x Performance utilizes a frame mounted safety compared to the slide mounted safety of the standard 92x.
