Instead of the classic Bluetooth seventy-nine 1-MHz channels, Bluetooth Low Energy has forty 2-MHz channels. Within a channel, data is transmitted using [[GFSK|Gaussian frequency shift modulation]], similar to classic Bluetooth's Basic Rate scheme. The bit rate is 1&nbsp;Mbit/s (with an option of 2&nbsp;Mbit/s in Bluetooth 5), and the maximum transmit power is 10&nbsp;mW (100&nbsp;mW in Bluetooth 5). Further details are given in Volume 6 Part A (Physical Layer Specification) of the [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=229737 Bluetooth Core Specification V4.0].\n\nBluetooth Low Energy uses [[frequency hopping]] to counteract narrowband interference problems. Classic Bluetooth also uses frequency hopping but the details are different; as a result, while both [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and [[ETSI]] classify Bluetooth technology as an [[FHSS]] scheme, Bluetooth Low Energy is classified as a system using digital modulation techniques or a [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]].<ref>Bluetooth Special Interest Group [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=237781 \"Bluetooth Low Energy Regulatory Aspects\"], April 2011</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Note that power consumption is not part of the Bluetooth specification.\n\n=== Advertising and discovery ===\nBLE devices are detected through a procedure based on broadcasting advertising packets. This is done using 3 separate channels (frequencies), in order to reduce interference. The advertising device sends a packet on at least one of these three channels, with a repetition period called the advertising interval. For reducing the chance of multiple consecutive collisions, a random delay of up to 10 milliseconds is added to each advertising interval. The scanner listens to the channel for a duration called the scan window, which is periodically repeated every scan interval.\n\nThe discovery latency is therefore determined by a probabilistic process and depends on the three parameters (viz., the advertising interval, the scan interval and the scan window). The discovery scheme of BLE adopts a periodic-interval based technique, for which upper bounds on the discovery latency can be inferred for most parametrizations. While the discovery latencies of BLE can be approximated by models<ref>{{Cite journal|title=PI-LatencyComp - Neighbor Discovery in BLE-Like protocols|url=https://codeocean.com/2017/08/08/pi-latencycomp-neighbor-discovery-in-ble-like-protocols|journal=CodeOcean|volume=|pages=|doi=10.24433/co.fec70c60-c265-4eea-9e37-8f7222ec5c92|via=|year=2017|last1=Kindt|first1=Philipp H.}}</ref> for purely periodic interval-based protocols, the random delay added to each advertising interval and the three-channel discovery can cause deviations from these predictions, or potentially lead to unbounded latencies for certain parametrizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kindt|first=P.

BTLE or Bluetooth Smart, is a new modulation mode and link layer packet format targeting low powered devices and is found in recent high-end smart phones, sports devices, sensors, and will soon appear in many medical devices. Unfortunately the security implementation is broken with the encryption of any Bluetooth LE Energy link easily being rendered useless. This flaw in security can allow any device nearby to eavesdrop on Bluetooth Low Energy conversations.

The [[application programming interface]] offered by a Bluetooth Low Energy aware operating system will typically be based around GATT concepts.<ref>See for example Apple's [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CoreBluetooth_Framework/_index.html Core Bluetooth] framework</ref> GATT has the following terminology:\n\n;Client\n:A device that initiates GATT commands and requests, and accepts responses, for example, a computer or smartphone.\n;Server\n:A device that receives GATT commands and requests, and returns responses, for example, a temperature sensor.\n;Characteristic\n:A data value transferred between client and server, for example, the current battery voltage.\n;Service\n:A collection of related characteristics, which operate together to perform a particular function. For instance, the ''Health Thermometer'' service includes characteristics for a temperature measurement value, and a time interval between measurements.\n;Descriptor\n:A descriptor provides additional information about a characteristic. For instance, a temperature value characteristic may have an indication of its units (e.g. Celsius), and the maximum and minimum values which the sensor can measure. Descriptors are optional \u2013 each characteristic can have any number of descriptors.\n\nSome service and characteristic values are used for administrative purposes \u2013 for instance, the model name and serial number can be read as standard characteristics within the ''Generic Access'' service. Services may also include other services as sub-functions; the main functions of the device are so-called ''primary'' services, and the auxiliary functions they refer to are ''secondary'' services.\n\n==== Identifiers ====\n\nServices, characteristics, and descriptors are collectively referred to as ''attributes'', and identified by [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]]s. Any implementer may pick a random or pseudorandom UUID for [[Proprietary format|proprietary]] uses, but the Bluetooth SIG have reserved a range of UUIDs (of the form ''{{not a typo|xxxxxxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB}}'' <ref>See sec 2.5.1 of the ''Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification''</ref>) for standard attributes. For efficiency, these identifiers are represented as 16-bit or 32-bit values in the protocol, rather than the 128 bits required for a full UUID. For example, the ''Device Information'' service has the short code 0x180A, rather than {{not a typo|0000180A-0000-1000-}}... . The full list is kept in the [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services/ Bluetooth Assigned Numbers] document online.\n\n==== GATT operations ====\n\nThe GATT protocol provides a number of commands for the client to discover information about the server. These include:\n* Discover UUIDs for all primary services\n* Find a service with a given UUID\n* Find secondary services for a given primary service\n* Discover all characteristics for a given service\n* Find characteristics matching a given UUID\n* Read all descriptors for a particular characteristic\n\nCommands are also provided to ''read'' (data transfer from server to client) and ''write'' (from client to server) the values of characteristics:\n* A value may be read either by specifying the characteristic's UUID, or by a ''handle'' value (which is returned by the information discovery commands above).\n* Write operations always identify the characteristic by handle, but have a choice of whether or not a response from the server is required.\n* 'Long read' and 'Long write' operations can be used when the length of the characteristic's data exceeds the [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] of the radio link.\n\nFinally, GATT offers ''notifications'' and ''indications''. The client may request a notification for a particular characteristic from the server. The server can then send the value to the client whenever it becomes available. For instance, a temperature sensor server may notify its client every time it takes a measurement. This avoids the need for the client to [[Polling (computer science)|poll]] the server, which would require the server's radio circuitry to be constantly operational.\n\nAn ''indication'' is similar to a notification, except that it requires a response from the client, as confirmation that it has received the message.\n\n==== Battery impact ====\n\n[[File:BLE Chipsets Power.png|thumb|upright|300px|Bluetooth Low Energy chipset power consumption profiles with different configuration parameters, as per The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware by Aislelabs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/beacon-guide/|title=The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware: A Comprehensive Report by Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-10-03|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref>]]\n\nBluetooth Low Energy is designed to enable devices to have very low power consumption. Several chipmakers including [[Cambridge Silicon Radio]], [[Dialog Semiconductor]], [[Nordic Semiconductor]], [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Cypress Semiconductor]], [[Silicon Labs]] and [[Texas Instruments]] had introduced Bluetooth Low Energy optimized chipsets by 2014. Devices with peripheral and central roles have different power requirements. A study by beacon software company [[Aislelabs]] reported that peripherals such as proximity beacons usually function for 1\u20132 years powered by a 1,000mAh coin cell battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/11/04/how-to-find-the-best-beacon-hardware-for-everything-from-stores-to-cities/|title=How to find the best beacon hardware for everything from stores to cities|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-10-04|accessdate=2014-10-11}}</ref> This is possible because of the power efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol, which only transmits small packets as compared to Bluetooth Classic which is also suitable for audio and high bandwidth data.\n\nIn contrast, a continuous scan for the same beacons in central role can consume 1,000 mAh in a few hours. Android and iOS devices also have very different battery impact depending on type of scans and the number of Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/08/14/in-terms-of-battery-life-android-devices-are-more-optimized-for-ibeacons-than-iphones/|title=In terms of battery life, Android devices are more optimized for iBeacons than iPhones|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref> With newer chipsets and advances in software, by 2014 both Android and iOS phones had negligible power consumption in real-life Bluetooth Low Energy use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-drain-iphones/|title=iBeacon Battery Drain on Apple vs Android: A Technical Report|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 2M PHY ===\nBluetooth 5 has introduced a new transmission mode with a doubled [[symbol rate]]. Bluetooth LE has been traditionally transmitting 1 bit per symbol so that theoretically the data rate doubles as well. However the new mode doubles the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] from about 1&nbsp;MHz to about 2&nbsp;MHz which makes for more interferences on the edge regions. The partitioning of the ISM frequency band has not changed being still 40&nbsp;channels spaced at a distance of 2&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=edn2017>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459086/Bluetooth-5--More-speeds--more-range--new-RF-tests|title=Bluetooth 5: More speeds, more range, new RF tests|author=Allen Henley|date=2017-11-21|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref> This is an essential differences over Bluetooth 2 EDR which did also double the data rate but it is doing that by employing a \u03c0/4-DQPSK or 8-DPSK [[phase modulation]] on a 1&nbsp;MhZ channel while Bluetooth 5 continues to use just frequency shift keying.\n\nThe traditional transmission of 1 Mbit in the Bluetooth Basic Rate was renamed 1M PHY in Bluetooth 5. The new mode at a doubled symbol speed was introduced as the 2M PHY. In Bluetooth Low Energy every transmission starts on the 1M PHY leaving it to the application to initiate a switch to the 2M PHY. In that case both sender and receiver will switch to the 2M PHY for transmissions. This is designed to facilitate firmware updates where the application can switch back to a traditional 1M PHY in case of errors. In reality the target device should be close to the programming station (at a few meters).\n\n=== LE Coded ===\nBluetooth 5 has introduced two new modes with lower data rate. The symbol rate of the new \"Coded PHY\" is the same as the Base Rate 1M PHY but in mode S=2 there are two symbols transmitted per data bit. In mode S=2 only a simple Pattern Mapping P=1 is used which simply produces the same stuffing bit for each input data bit. In mode S=8 there are eight symbols per data bit with a Pattern Mapping P=4 producing contrasting symbol sequences - a 0 bit is encoded as binary 0011 and a 1 bit is encoded as binary 1100.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/long-distance-bluetooth-low-energy-bit-data-paths/|title=What is Bluetooth 5? Learn about the Bit Paths Behind the New BLE Standard|author=Mark Hughes}}</ref> In mode S=2 using P=1 the range doubles approximately, while in mode S=8 using P=4 it does quadruple.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/exploring-bluetooth-5-going-the-distance/|title=Exploring Bluetooth 5 -Going the Distance|first=Martin|last=Woolley|date=13 February 2017|website=Bluetooth Technology Website}}</ref>\n\nThe \"LE Coded\" transmissions have not only changed the error correction scheme but it uses a fundamentally new package format. Each \"LE Coded\" burst consists of three blocks. The switch block (\"extended preamble\") is transmitted on the LE 1M PHY but it does only consist of 10 times a binaryr '00111100' pattern. These 80 bits are not FEC encoded as usual but they are sent directly to the radio channel. It is followed by a header block (\"FEC Block 1\") which is always transmitted in S=8 mode. The header block does only contain the destination address (\"Access Address\" / 32 bit) and an encoding flag (\"Coding Indicator\" / 2 Bit). The Coding Indicator defines the Pattern Mapping used for the following payload block (\"FEC Block 2\") where S=2 is possible.<ref name=edn2018>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459130/Bluetooth-5-variations-complicate-PHY-testing|title=Bluetooth 5 variations complicate PHY testing|author=Dorine Gurney|date=2018-01-29|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref>\n\nThe new package format of Bluetooth 5 allows to transmit from 2 up to 256 bytes as the payload in a single burst. This is a lot more than the maximum of 31 bytes in Bluetooth 4. Along with reach measurements this should allow for localisation functions. As a whole the quadrupled range - at the same transmission power - is achieved at the expense of a lower data being at an eight with 125&nbsp;kBit. The old transmission package format, as it continues to be used in the 1M PHY and 2M PHY modes, has been named \"Uncoded\" in Bluetooth 5. The intermediate \"LE Coded\" S=2 mode allows for a  500&nbsp;kBit data rate in the payload which is both beneficial for shorter latencies as well lower power consumption as the burst time itself is shorter.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ANT (network)|ANT]]\n* [[ANT+]]\n* [[DASH7]]\n* [[Eddystone (Google)|Eddystone]]\n* [[IEEE 802.15]] / [[IEEE 802.15.4-2006]]\n* [[Indoor positioning system]] (IPS)\n*[[LoRa]]\n* [[MyriaNed]]\n* [[Ultra-wideband]] (UWB)\n* [[UWB Forum]]\n* [[WiMedia Alliance]]\n* [[WirelessHD]]\n* [[Wireless USB]]\n* [[Zigbee]]\n* [[Z-Wave]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications|title=Specifications - Bluetooth Technology Website|website=www.bluetooth.org}} \"Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification\" \u2013 GATT is described in full in Volume 3, Part G\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website|https://www.bluetooth.com}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Gomez|first1=Carles|last2=Oller|first2=Joaquim|last3=Paradells|first3=Josep|title=Overview and Evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy: An Emerging Low-Power Wireless Technology|journal=Sensors|volume=12|issue=9|date=29 August 2012|pages=11734\u201311753|issn=1424-8220|doi=10.3390/s120911734|pmc=3478807}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bluetooth Low Energy}}\n[[Category:Bluetooth]]\n[[Category:Open standards]]\n[[Category:Wireless networking]]\n[[Category:Radio-frequency identification]]\n[[Category:Tracking]]\n[[Category:Ubiquitous computing]]\n[[Category:Wireless locating]]\n[[Category:Indoor positioning system]]\n[[Category:Wireless communication systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n'''Bluetooth Low Energy''' ('''Bluetooth LE''', colloquially '''BLE''', formerly marketed as '''Bluetooth Smart'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/how-it-works/low-energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310111443/https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/how-it-works/low-energy|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-03-10|title=Bluetooth Smart or Version 4.0+ of the Bluetooth specification|website=bluetooth.com}}</ref>) is a [[Personal area network|wireless personal area network]] technology designed and marketed by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] (Bluetooth SIG) aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, [[Physical fitness|fitness]], beacons,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/beacons-retail-location.aspx |title=beacons |access-date=21 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024074548/http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/beacons-retail-location.aspx |archive-date=24 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> security, and home entertainment industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart.aspx|title=bluetooth.com: Bluetooth Smart|author=|date=|website=bluetooth.com}}</ref>  It is independent of BR / EDR and has no compatibility, but BR / EDR and LE can coexist.

Manufacturers are expected to implement the appropriate specifications for their device in order to ensure compatibility. A device may contain implementations of multiple profiles.\n\nThe majority of current low energy application profiles are based on the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT), a general specification for sending and receiving short pieces of data, known as attributes, over a low energy link.<ref>Bluetooth SIG [https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications Adopted specifications]</ref> The [[Bluetooth mesh]] profile is an exception to this rule, being based on the General Access Profile (GAP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/mesh|title=Bluetooth Mesh and the IOT|last=bluetooth|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Mesh profiles ===\nBluetooth mesh profiles use Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with other Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the network. Each device can pass the information forward to other Bluetooth Low Energy devices creating a \"mesh\" effect.

Instead of the classic Bluetooth seventy-nine 1-MHz channels, Bluetooth Low Energy has forty 2-MHz channels. Within a channel, data is transmitted using [[GFSK|Gaussian frequency shift modulation]], similar to classic Bluetooth's Basic Rate scheme. The bit rate is 1&nbsp;Mbit/s (with an option of 2&nbsp;Mbit/s in Bluetooth 5), and the maximum transmit power is 10&nbsp;mW (100&nbsp;mW in Bluetooth 5). Further details are given in Volume 6 Part A (Physical Layer Specification) of the [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=229737 Bluetooth Core Specification V4.0].\n\nBluetooth Low Energy uses [[frequency hopping]] to counteract narrowband interference problems. Classic Bluetooth also uses frequency hopping but the details are different; as a result, while both [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] and [[ETSI]] classify Bluetooth technology as an [[FHSS]] scheme, Bluetooth Low Energy is classified as a system using digital modulation techniques or a [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]].<ref>Bluetooth Special Interest Group [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=237781 \"Bluetooth Low Energy Regulatory Aspects\"], April 2011</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Note that power consumption is not part of the Bluetooth specification.\n\n=== Advertising and discovery ===\nBLE devices are detected through a procedure based on broadcasting advertising packets. This is done using 3 separate channels (frequencies), in order to reduce interference. The advertising device sends a packet on at least one of these three channels, with a repetition period called the advertising interval. For reducing the chance of multiple consecutive collisions, a random delay of up to 10 milliseconds is added to each advertising interval. The scanner listens to the channel for a duration called the scan window, which is periodically repeated every scan interval.\n\nThe discovery latency is therefore determined by a probabilistic process and depends on the three parameters (viz., the advertising interval, the scan interval and the scan window). The discovery scheme of BLE adopts a periodic-interval based technique, for which upper bounds on the discovery latency can be inferred for most parametrizations. While the discovery latencies of BLE can be approximated by models<ref>{{Cite journal|title=PI-LatencyComp - Neighbor Discovery in BLE-Like protocols|url=https://codeocean.com/2017/08/08/pi-latencycomp-neighbor-discovery-in-ble-like-protocols|journal=CodeOcean|volume=|pages=|doi=10.24433/co.fec70c60-c265-4eea-9e37-8f7222ec5c92|via=|year=2017|last1=Kindt|first1=Philipp H.}}</ref> for purely periodic interval-based protocols, the random delay added to each advertising interval and the three-channel discovery can cause deviations from these predictions, or potentially lead to unbounded latencies for certain parametrizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kindt|first=P.

BTLE or Bluetooth Smart, is a new modulation mode and link layer packet format targeting low powered devices and is found in recent high-end smart phones, sports devices, sensors, and will soon appear in many medical devices. Unfortunately the security implementation is broken with the encryption of any Bluetooth LE Energy link easily being rendered useless. This flaw in security can allow any device nearby to eavesdrop on Bluetooth Low Energy conversations. This includes packets being intercepted and reassembled into connection streams, as well as injection attacks.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarkar|first1=Sopan|last2=Liu|first2=Jianqing|last3=Jovanov|first3=Emil|title=A Robust Algorithm for Sniffing BLE Long-Lived Connections in Real-Time|journal=2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)|year=2019|pages=1\u20136|doi=10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9014318}}</ref>\n\n=== Software model ===\nAll Bluetooth Low Energy devices use the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT). The [[application programming interface]] offered by a Bluetooth Low Energy aware operating system will typically be based around GATT concepts.<ref>See for example Apple's [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CoreBluetooth_Framework/_index.html Core Bluetooth] framework</ref> GATT has the following terminology:\n\n;Client\n:A device that initiates GATT commands and requests, and accepts responses, for example, a computer or smartphone.\n;Server\n:A device that receives GATT commands and requests, and returns responses, for example, a temperature sensor.\n;Characteristic\n:A data value transferred between client and server, for example, the current battery voltage.\n;Service\n:A collection of related characteristics, which operate together to perform a particular function. For instance, the ''Health Thermometer'' service includes characteristics for a temperature measurement value, and a time interval between measurements.\n;Descriptor\n:A descriptor provides additional information about a characteristic. For instance, a temperature value characteristic may have an indication of its units (e.g. Celsius), and the maximum and minimum values which the sensor can measure. Descriptors are optional \u2013 each characteristic can have any number of descriptors.\n\nSome service and characteristic values are used for administrative purposes \u2013 for instance, the model name and serial number can be read as standard characteristics within the ''Generic Access'' service. Services may also include other services as sub-functions; the main functions of the device are so-called ''primary'' services, and the auxiliary functions they refer to are ''secondary'' services.\n\n==== Identifiers ====\n\nServices, characteristics, and descriptors are collectively referred to as ''attributes'', and identified by [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]]s. Any implementer may pick a random or pseudorandom UUID for [[Proprietary format|proprietary]] uses, but the Bluetooth SIG have reserved a range of UUIDs (of the form ''{{not a typo|xxxxxxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB}}'' <ref>See sec 2.5.1 of the ''Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification''</ref>) for standard attributes. For efficiency, these identifiers are represented as 16-bit or 32-bit values in the protocol, rather than the 128 bits required for a full UUID. For example, the ''Device Information'' service has the short code 0x180A, rather than {{not a typo|0000180A-0000-1000-}}... . The full list is kept in the [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services/ Bluetooth Assigned Numbers] document online.\n\n==== GATT operations ====\n\nThe GATT protocol provides a number of commands for the client to discover information about the server. These include:\n* Discover UUIDs for all primary services\n* Find a service with a given UUID\n* Find secondary services for a given primary service\n* Discover all characteristics for a given service\n* Find characteristics matching a given UUID\n* Read all descriptors for a particular characteristic\n\nCommands are also provided to ''read'' (data transfer from server to client) and ''write'' (from client to server) the values of characteristics:\n* A value may be read either by specifying the characteristic's UUID, or by a ''handle'' value (which is returned by the information discovery commands above).\n* Write operations always identify the characteristic by handle, but have a choice of whether or not a response from the server is required.\n* 'Long read' and 'Long write' operations can be used when the length of the characteristic's data exceeds the [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] of the radio link.\n\nFinally, GATT offers ''notifications'' and ''indications''. The client may request a notification for a particular characteristic from the server. The server can then send the value to the client whenever it becomes available. For instance, a temperature sensor server may notify its client every time it takes a measurement. This avoids the need for the client to [[Polling (computer science)|poll]] the server, which would require the server's radio circuitry to be constantly operational.\n\nAn ''indication'' is similar to a notification, except that it requires a response from the client, as confirmation that it has received the message.\n\n==== Battery impact ====\n\n[[File:BLE Chipsets Power.png|thumb|upright|300px|Bluetooth Low Energy chipset power consumption profiles with different configuration parameters, as per The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware by Aislelabs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/beacon-guide/|title=The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware: A Comprehensive Report by Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-10-03|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref>]]\n\nBluetooth Low Energy is designed to enable devices to have very low power consumption.

Devices with peripheral and central roles have different power requirements. A study by beacon software company [[Aislelabs]] reported that peripherals such as proximity beacons usually function for 1\u20132 years powered by a 1,000mAh coin cell battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/11/04/how-to-find-the-best-beacon-hardware-for-everything-from-stores-to-cities/|title=How to find the best beacon hardware for everything from stores to cities|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-10-04|accessdate=2014-10-11}}</ref> This is possible because of the power efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol, which only transmits small packets as compared to Bluetooth Classic which is also suitable for audio and high bandwidth data.\n\nIn contrast, a continuous scan for the same beacons in central role can consume 1,000 mAh in a few hours. Android and iOS devices also have very different battery impact depending on type of scans and the number of Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/08/14/in-terms-of-battery-life-android-devices-are-more-optimized-for-ibeacons-than-iphones/|title=In terms of battery life, Android devices are more optimized for iBeacons than iPhones|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref> With newer chipsets and advances in software, by 2014 both Android and iOS phones had negligible power consumption in real-life Bluetooth Low Energy use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-drain-iphones/|title=iBeacon Battery Drain on Apple vs Android: A Technical Report|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 2M PHY ===\nBluetooth 5 has introduced a new transmission mode with a doubled [[symbol rate]]. Bluetooth LE has been traditionally transmitting 1 bit per symbol so that theoretically the data rate doubles as well. However the new mode doubles the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] from about 1&nbsp;MHz to about 2&nbsp;MHz which makes for more interferences on the edge regions. The partitioning of the ISM frequency band has not changed being still 40&nbsp;channels spaced at a distance of 2&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=edn2017>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459086/Bluetooth-5--More-speeds--more-range--new-RF-tests|title=Bluetooth 5: More speeds, more range, new RF tests|author=Allen Henley|date=2017-11-21|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref> This is an essential differences over Bluetooth 2 EDR which did also double the data rate but it is doing that by employing a \u03c0/4-DQPSK or 8-DPSK [[phase modulation]] on a 1&nbsp;MhZ channel while Bluetooth 5 continues to use just frequency shift keying.\n\nThe traditional transmission of 1 Mbit in the Bluetooth Basic Rate was renamed 1M PHY in Bluetooth 5. The new mode at a doubled symbol speed was introduced as the 2M PHY. In Bluetooth Low Energy every transmission starts on the 1M PHY leaving it to the application to initiate a switch to the 2M PHY. In that case both sender and receiver will switch to the 2M PHY for transmissions. This is designed to facilitate firmware updates where the application can switch back to a traditional 1M PHY in case of errors. In reality the target device should be close to the programming station (at a few meters).\n\n=== LE Coded ===\nBluetooth 5 has introduced two new modes with lower data rate. The symbol rate of the new \"Coded PHY\" is the same as the Base Rate 1M PHY but in mode S=2 there are two symbols transmitted per data bit. In mode S=2 only a simple Pattern Mapping P=1 is used which simply produces the same stuffing bit for each input data bit. In mode S=8 there are eight symbols per data bit with a Pattern Mapping P=4 producing contrasting symbol sequences - a 0 bit is encoded as binary 0011 and a 1 bit is encoded as binary 1100.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/long-distance-bluetooth-low-energy-bit-data-paths/|title=What is Bluetooth 5? Learn about the Bit Paths Behind the New BLE Standard|author=Mark Hughes}}</ref> In mode S=2 using P=1 the range doubles approximately, while in mode S=8 using P=4 it does quadruple.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/exploring-bluetooth-5-going-the-distance/|title=Exploring Bluetooth 5 -Going the Distance|first=Martin|last=Woolley|date=13 February 2017|website=Bluetooth Technology Website}}</ref>\n\nThe \"LE Coded\" transmissions have not only changed the error correction scheme but it uses a fundamentally new package format. Each \"LE Coded\" burst consists of three blocks. The switch block (\"extended preamble\") is transmitted on the LE 1M PHY but it does only consist of 10 times a binaryr '00111100' pattern. These 80 bits are not FEC encoded as usual but they are sent directly to the radio channel. It is followed by a header block (\"FEC Block 1\") which is always transmitted in S=8 mode. The header block does only contain the destination address (\"Access Address\" / 32 bit) and an encoding flag (\"Coding Indicator\" / 2 Bit). The Coding Indicator defines the Pattern Mapping used for the following payload block (\"FEC Block 2\") where S=2 is possible.<ref name=edn2018>{{cite web|url=https://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4459130/Bluetooth-5-variations-complicate-PHY-testing|title=Bluetooth 5 variations complicate PHY testing|author=Dorine Gurney|date=2018-01-29|publisher=EDN Network}}</ref>\n\nThe new package format of Bluetooth 5 allows to transmit from 2 up to 256 bytes as the payload in a single burst. This is a lot more than the maximum of 31 bytes in Bluetooth 4. Along with reach measurements this should allow for localisation functions. As a whole the quadrupled range - at the same transmission power - is achieved at the expense of a lower data being at an eight with 125&nbsp;kBit. The old transmission package format, as it continues to be used in the 1M PHY and 2M PHY modes, has been named \"Uncoded\" in Bluetooth 5. The intermediate \"LE Coded\" S=2 mode allows for a  500&nbsp;kBit data rate in the payload which is both beneficial for shorter latencies as well lower power consumption as the burst time itself is shorter.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ANT (network)|ANT]]\n* [[ANT+]]\n* [[DASH7]]\n* [[Eddystone (Google)|Eddystone]]\n* [[IEEE 802.15]] / [[IEEE 802.15.4-2006]]\n* [[Indoor positioning system]] (IPS)\n*[[LoRa]]\n* [[MyriaNed]]\n* [[Ultra-wideband]] (UWB)\n* [[UWB Forum]]\n* [[WiMedia Alliance]]\n* [[WirelessHD]]\n* [[Wireless USB]]\n* [[Zigbee]]\n* [[Z-Wave]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications|title=Specifications - Bluetooth Technology Website|website=www.bluetooth.org}} \"Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification\" \u2013 GATT is described in full in Volume 3, Part G\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website|https://www.bluetooth.com}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Gomez|first1=Carles|last2=Oller|first2=Joaquim|last3=Paradells|first3=Josep|title=Overview and Evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy: An Emerging Low-Power Wireless Technology|journal=Sensors|volume=12|issue=9|date=29 August 2012|pages=11734\u201311753|issn=1424-8220|doi=10.3390/s120911734|pmc=3478807}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bluetooth Low Energy}}\n[[Category:Bluetooth]]\n[[Category:Open standards]]\n[[Category:Wireless networking]]\n[[Category:Radio-frequency identification]]\n[[Category:Tracking]]\n[[Category:Ubiquitous computing]]\n[[Category:Wireless locating]]\n[[Category:Indoor positioning system]]\n[[Category:Wireless communication systems]]\n", "name_user": "Pol098", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSecurity", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy"}

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]] , which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"baron\"/> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.

Acute infections tend to occur for a relatively short duration, while persistent infections are when the virus is not completely cleared from the body. In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can sometimes [[Carcinogenesis|transform host cells into cancer cells]]. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" /><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Walther Mothes | author2=Nathan M.

The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host. This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]]. \n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2005|avian H5N1 influenza pandemic in 2005]], aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a [[cytokine storm]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Tisoncik JR, Korth MJ, Simmons CP, Farrar J, Martin TR, Katze MG | title=Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm | journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] | volume=76 | year=2012 | pages=3826\u20133833 | doi=10.1128/MMBR.05015-11 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nIn some instances, viral infection can initiate an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune response]], which occurs via two proposed mechanisms: '''molecular mimicry''' and '''bystander mechanism'''.

The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process. Damage caused by the host itself due to autoimmunity was observed in infections such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or the [[West Nile virus]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Smatti MK, Cyprian FS, Nasrallah GK, Al Thani AA, Almishal RO, Yassine HM | title=Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms | journal=[[Viruses (journal)]] | volume=8 | year=2019 | doi=10.3390/v11080762 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\n==Incubation Period==\nViruses display variable [[incubation period]]s upon virus entry into the host. The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "text_old": "'''Viral pathogenesis''' is the study of how [[virus]]es cause diseases in their target [[Host (biology)|host]]s, usually carried out at the cellular or molecular level.

This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]] , which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"baron\"/> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name=gonzalez/><ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host.

It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Jawetz, Melnick, & Adelberg\u2019s Medical Microbiology |edition=28|last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\n\nA viral infection does not always cause disease. A viral infection simply involves viral replication in the host, but [[disease]] is the damage caused by the viral multiplication.<ref name=\"refMM\" /> An individual who has a viral infection but does not display disease symptoms is known as a [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]. \n\n[[File:Damage caused by viruses to host cells.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=Diagram representing the various ways viral infections can induce damage and disease to host cells|Mechanisms by which viruses cause damage and disease to host cells]]\n\n===Damage caused by the virus===\n\nOnce inside host cells, viruses can destroy cells through a variety of mechanisms. Viruses often induce direct cytopathic effects to disrupt cellular functions. This could be through releasing toxic proteins or enzymes to degrade host metabolic precursors, or inhibiting the synthesis of important host factors, proteins, DNA and/or RNA. Namely, viral proteins of herpes simplex virus can degrade host DNA and inhibit host cell DNA replication and mRNA transcription.<ref name =\"robbins\" /> Poliovirus can inactivate proteins involved in host mRNA translation without affecting poliovirus mRNA translation.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\">{{Cite book|title=Fenner's Veterinary Virology|last=MacLachlan|first=James|last2=Dubovi|first2=Edward|date=2011|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|isbn=9780123751584|edition=4th}}</ref> In some cases, expression of viral fusion proteins on the surface of the host cells can cause host cell fusion to form multinucleated cells.

Acute infections tend to occur for a relatively short duration, while persistent infections are when the virus is not completely cleared from the body. In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can sometimes [[Carcinogenesis|transform host cells into cancer cells]]. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" /><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Walther Mothes | author2=Nathan M.

The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host. This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]]. \n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2005|avian H5N1 influenza pandemic in 2005]], aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a [[cytokine storm]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Tisoncik JR, Korth MJ, Simmons CP, Farrar J, Martin TR, Katze MG | title=Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm | journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] | volume=76 | year=2012 | pages=3826\u20133833 | doi=10.1128/MMBR.05015-11 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nIn some instances, viral infection can initiate an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune response]], which occurs via two proposed mechanisms: '''molecular mimicry''' and '''bystander mechanism'''. [[Molecular mimicry]] refers to an overlap in structural similarity between a viral [[antigen]] and a self-antigen. The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process. Damage caused by the host itself due to autoimmunity was observed in infections such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or the [[West Nile virus]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Smatti MK, Cyprian FS, Nasrallah GK, Al Thani AA, Almishal RO, Yassine HM | title=Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms | journal=[[Viruses (journal)]] | volume=8 | year=2019 | doi=10.3390/v11080762 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\n==Incubation Period==\nViruses display variable [[incubation period]]s upon virus entry into the host. The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellelyy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDamage caused by the virus", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pathogenesis"}

Tony Daws.\n\nDaws also represented Yorkshire Boys in cricket, rugby and athletics and if he had not made it as a professional footballer he was tipped to have a promising future in athletics.\n\nIn those days, a boy could not sign a contract with a club until his 14th birthday, and the big clubs would \"court\" the best boys in the country in the years leading up to this landmark age. Daws' pace, strength and predatory scoring had alerted the big clubs and there were a number eager to sign him.\n\n==Schoolboy contracts==\nDaws was spotted by a Manchester United scout and subsequently signed for the club, with his registration filed on his 14th birthday. One year later it occurred to him and his father, James, that he would have to be a truly exceptional player to make the Manchester United first team. In front of him in the pecking order were established first-team players [[Joe Jordan (footballer)|Joe Jordan]], [[Steve Coppell]], [[Andy Ritchie (English footballer)|Andy Ritchie]], [[Mickey Thomas (footballer)|Mickey Thomas]] and [[Gary Birtles]]. Then there were the Youth Team players [[Norman Whiteside]] and [[Mark Hughes]] and the \"unknowns\" in the U16 and U15 age groups. Daws and his father decided to ask for his release from the club.\n\nIn 1981 following persuasion from [[Jimmy Sirrel]] (general manager) and [[Howard Wilkinson]] (Head Coach) of [[Notts County F.C|Notts County]], Daws signed schoolboy forms for the Nottingham club. Sirrell had known of Daws from when he was the manager of Sheffield United in 1977, having watched him play for the Sheffield Boys team at United's training ground. Daws went on to play for Notts County's Youth (U18) team as a 15- and 16-year-old.\n\n==Professional playing career==\n===Apprenticeship and Notts County===\nDaws signed a two-year apprenticeship with Notts County upon leaving school in 1983. He made his reserve-team debut for County whilst still at school and went on to make his first-team debut whilst still an apprentice, aged 18. That first League appearance was on 9 March 1985 in a 1\u20132 loss at [[Birmingham City]] in the old Second Division. The following week Daws opened his goalscoring account in the second minute of a 4\u20131 away success against [[Cardiff City]]. He made seven appearances (6 + 1sub) that season, scoring one goal. The following season Daws made just the one substitute appearance. He was released at the end of the 1985\u201386 season following Notts County's relegation to the old Third Division.\n\n===Sheffield United===\nDaws moved to Second Division club [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on a free transfer for the [[1986-87 in English football|1986\u201387]] season. He made his debut for his hometown club on 8 November 1986, scoring both goals in a 2\u20130 win at [[Blackburn Rovers]] for [[Billy McEwan (footballer, born 1951)|Billy McEwan]]'s ''Blades'' team. Daws made eleven appearances for the club that season, scoring three goals. His contract was for only one year, and it was not renewed at the end of the season. Once again Daws was on the free-transfer list.\n\n===Scunthorpe United===\nThe [[1987-88 in English football|1987\u201388]] season saw Daws playing for Scunthorpe United in the Fourth Division. Daws made the short journey to North Lincolnshire to sign for new manager [[Mick Buxton]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scunthorpeunited-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadtmrs.asp?ssnno=117&teamno=460|title=The Men in Charge|work=[[Scunthorpe United F.C.]]|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref> in the summer of 1987. He made his debut for ''The Iron'' in the opening game of the season, a 3\u20130 home league win over Tranmere Rovers on 15 August 1987. It was during his time at Scunthorpe that he incurred the back injury that was to bring his playing career to a relatively early end.\n\n===After Scunthorpe===\nOn leaving Scunthorpe Daws moved to [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], then [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], [[Halifax Town F.C.|Halifax Town]], [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]] and [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]] before his back problems forced him to retire from playing at a relatively early age.\n\n==Coaching career==\n\nAfter retiring he took up coaching positions at [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] as part-time Youth Development Officer (1996\u20132000), then Assistant Academy and U19 Coach (2001\u20132004) before becoming under-nine to under-18 Youth Development Officer at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] (2004\u201305).\n\nHe has been the academy manager at [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] since 2005,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scunthorpe-united.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Announcements/0,,10442~669022,00.html| title=New Youth Coach|work=[[Scunthorpe United F.C.]]|accessdate=26 May 2008}}</ref> and was appointed Caretaker Manager on 16 March 2011,<ref>{{cite news | url =http://www.scunthorpe-united.co.uk/page/News/0,,10442~2316998,00.html | title = Daws Named Caretaker Manager | publisher = Scunthorpe United official website | date=16 March 2011 | accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref> following the sacking of manager [[Ian Baraclough]], until the appointment of [[Alan Knill]] on 31 March 2011.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Soccerbase}}\n*[http://www.redimps.com/archive3/index.mv?cat=players&drop=playerdetsdrop&play=daws01 Lincoln City F.C.

He represented his country at U15 and U18 level at football. His first appearance at Wembley was on 5 June 1982 in the Dentyne Trophy, which was contested against Scotland's U15s. Alongside him in that England U15 squad was his fellow Ashleigh school pupil [[John Beresford (footballer)|John Beresford]]. A third pupil from Sheffield was also in that England squad: [[Fraser Digby]] of Jordanthorpe School. The trio were key members of the Sheffield Boys U15s team along with Scott Sellers of Hinde House School and Steven Harris of Abbeydale Grange School that won the ESFA Inter Association Trophy in that year, the boys also played for the Sheffield Sunday League team Throstles.\n\nThe England starting line up that day was: 1.
