Established in 1760 by a group of [[Sephardic Jews]], the Board presents itself as a forum for the views of most organisations within the British [[Jew]]ish community, liaising with the British government on that basis. Notably, while [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Baron Rothschild]] was President of the Board of Deputies, the [[Balfour Declaration]] was addressed to him and eventually led to the creation of a [[Jewish state]] in Palestine. It is affiliated to the [[World Jewish Congress]] and the [[European Jewish Congress]]. Its current president is [[Marie van der Zyl]] who, due to holding this position, also sits on the Executive Committee of the World Jewish Congress.\n\n==History==\nThe Board of Deputies of British Jews was established in London in 1760, when seven Deputies were appointed by the elders of the [[Sephardi]] congregation of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] to form a standing committee and pay homage to [[King George III|George III]] on his accession to the throne.<ref name=\"BODarch\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=074-ACC3121_2&cid=0#0|title=The Discovery Service|first=The National|last=Archives|publisher=}}</ref> Shortly thereafter the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish congregation from Central and Eastern Europe similarly appointed their own \"Secret Committee for Public Affairs\" to deal with any urgent political matters that might arise,<ref name=\"RothEngl\">[[Cecil Roth]], ''A History of the Jews in England'', [http://www.iamthewitness.com/books/Cecil.Roth/A.History.of.the.Jews.in.England/P.10.The.Reign.of.George.III.1760-1815.htm Chapter 10, The Reign of George III, 1760\u20131815], 1941</ref> and safeguard the interests of British Jews as a religious community, both in the British Isles, and in the colonies.<ref name=\"JE'06\">Joseph Jacobs, [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10099-london-committee-of-deputies-of-british-jews London Committee of Deputies of British Jews]</ref> They soon began to meet together as occasions arose, and then on a more frequent basis; by the 1810s they appear to have united as one body.<ref name=\"BOD-hist\">[http://www.bod.org.uk/live/content.php?Category_ID=14 History of the Board] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023155653/http://www.bod.org.uk/live/content.php?Category_ID=14 |date=23 October 2013 }}, Board of Deputies of British Jews</ref> It was named the London Committee of Deputies of British Jews.\n\nIn the mid 18th century, the body was dominated by [[Moses Montefiore]], the [[Sephardi]] lay leader of British Jewry, and [[Nathan Marcus Adler|Nathan Adler]], the [[Ashkenazi]] Chief Rabbi. It adopted its current name in 1913. During its history, some of the major divisions in opinion have been between Sephardi and Ashkenazi and between religious and lay leaders.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thejc.com/culture/books/a-history-of-the-board-of-deputies-1760-2010-1.16817|title=A History of the Board of Deputies, 1760-2010|last=Aldern|first=Geoffrey|date=15 July 2010|accessdate=3 September 2019|newspaper=Jewish Chronicle}}</ref>\n\n==Members and organisation==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2018}}\nThe Board is led by [[Marie van der Zyl]], who succeeded Jonathan Arkush as President in June 2018.<ref name=\"Women\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/women-form-majority-of-board-of-deputies-leadership-for-the-first-time-1.464061 |title=Women form majority of Board of Deputies' leadership for the first time |last=Rocker |first=Simon |date=14 May 2018 |work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |access-date=14 May 2018}}</ref> The chief executive is [[Gillian Merron]], who represented Labour as [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament (MP) for Lincoln]] from 1997 to 2010.

She leads a team of professional staff including Director of Public Affairs, Philip Rosenberg (formerly of Faiths Forum for London).\n\nIts membership comprises Deputies elected by affiliated individual synagogues, confederations of synagogues, and other organisations within the Jewish community such as charities and youth groups. [[Haredi]] synagogues have chosen not to affiliate. In 2012, it was noted that nearly two thirds of the deputies were over 60 years of age.<ref name=guardian-20120427>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/apr/27/board-of-deputies-british-jews-revolution |title=A weak 'revolution' at the Board of Deputies of British Jews |last=Kahn-Harris |first=Keith |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 April 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIt serves as the principal reference point for government, the media and wider society.  All matters tending to impact on the life of Jews in Britain fall within the Board's remit, including an active interfaith programme. It is the British affiliate of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), the world-wide umbrella organisation of Jewish communities and is the UK member of the European Jewish Congress (EJC). Its offices are co-located with the [[UJIA|United Jewish Israel Appeal]] in Kentish Town.\n\nIn January 2019, the [[Jewish Leadership Council]] (JLC) reiterated its call for a \u201cunified communal structure\u201d with the Board of Deputies. A previous merger proposal was rejected in 2015 after Deputies felt that they would be relegated to second-rate status. In response to the later call, Marie van der Zyl said that \"the representative body that speaks for the community must have the legitimacy and accountability that comes from being broad based, democratic and elected.\" Deputies have in the past noted that, while Board honorary officers are accountable to deputies, who themselves are accountable to their constituencies, the JLC had no such governance structure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/jewish-leadership-council-seeking-unified-communal-structure/|title=Jewish Leadership Council seeking \u2018unified communal structure\u2019|last=Millis|first=Joe|date=8 Jan 2019|accessdate=3 September 2018|work=Jewish News}}</ref> However, in March 2020, van de Zyl called in the ''The Jewish Chronicle'' for 'a more permanent unity' between the organisations.\n\n==Issues==\nThe issues which the Board states it addresses are:\n\n* Antisemitism and extremism\n* Israel and the Middle East\n* Education\n* Religious freedoms and inequalities\n* Interfaith and social action\n* International advocacy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bod.org.uk/issues/antisemitism-extremism/|title=Issues|accessdate=18 August 2019|work=Board of Deputies of British Jews}}</ref>\n\n==Events==\nIn 2003, the Board, on its website, reproduced an extract from a US State Department report that suggested that the aid organisation [[Palestinian Relief and Development Fund]] (Interpal) was helping to fund terrorist organisations. Interpal threatened to sue for [[libel]], whereupon the Board retracted and apologised for its comments.<ref>Dominic Casciani, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3135392.stm Islamic charity cleared of Hamas link], ''[[BBC News]]'', 24 September 2003.

Established in 1760 by a group of [[Sephardic Jews]], the Board presents itself as a forum for the views of most organisations within the British [[Jew]]ish community, liaising with the British government on that basis. Notably, while [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Baron Rothschild]] was President of the Board of Deputies, the [[Balfour Declaration]] was addressed to him and eventually led to the creation of a [[Jewish state]] in Palestine. It is affiliated to the [[World Jewish Congress]] and the [[European Jewish Congress]]. Its current president is [[Marie van der Zyl]] who, due to holding this position, also sits on the Executive Committee of the World Jewish Congress.\n\n==History==\nThe Board of Deputies of British Jews was established in London in 1760, when seven Deputies were appointed by the elders of the [[Sephardi]] congregation of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] to form a standing committee and pay homage to [[King George III|George III]] on his accession to the throne.<ref name=\"BODarch\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=074-ACC3121_2&cid=0#0|title=The Discovery Service|first=The National|last=Archives|publisher=}}</ref> Shortly thereafter the [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish congregation from Central and Eastern Europe similarly appointed their own \"Secret Committee for Public Affairs\" to deal with any urgent political matters that might arise,<ref name=\"RothEngl\">[[Cecil Roth]], ''A History of the Jews in England'', [http://www.iamthewitness.com/books/Cecil.Roth/A.History.of.the.Jews.in.England/P.10.The.Reign.of.George.III.1760-1815.htm Chapter 10, The Reign of George III, 1760\u20131815], 1941</ref> and safeguard the interests of British Jews as a religious community, both in the British Isles, and in the colonies.<ref name=\"JE'06\">Joseph Jacobs, [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10099-london-committee-of-deputies-of-british-jews London Committee of Deputies of British Jews]</ref> They soon began to meet together as occasions arose, and then on a more frequent basis; by the 1810s they appear to have united as one body.<ref name=\"BOD-hist\">[http://www.bod.org.uk/live/content.php?Category_ID=14 History of the Board] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023155653/http://www.bod.org.uk/live/content.php?Category_ID=14 |date=23 October 2013 }}, Board of Deputies of British Jews</ref> It was named the London Committee of Deputies of British Jews.\n\nIn the mid 18th century, the body was dominated by [[Moses Montefiore]], the [[Sephardi]] lay leader of British Jewry, and [[Nathan Marcus Adler|Nathan Adler]], the [[Ashkenazi]] Chief Rabbi. It adopted its current name in 1913.

[[Haredi]] synagogues have chosen not to affiliate.

All matters tending to impact on the life of Jews in Britain fall within the Board's remit, including an active interfaith programme. It is the British affiliate of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), the world-wide umbrella organisation of Jewish communities and is the UK member of the European Jewish Congress (EJC). Its offices are co-located with the [[UJIA|United Jewish Israel Appeal]] in Kentish Town.\n\nIn January 2019, the [[Jewish Leadership Council]] (JLC) reiterated its call for a \u201cunified communal structure\u201d with the Board of Deputies. A previous merger proposal was rejected in 2015 after Deputies felt that they would be relegated to second-rate status. In response to the later call, Marie van der Zyl said that \"the representative body that speaks for the community must have the legitimacy and accountability that comes from being broad based, democratic and elected.\" Deputies have in the past noted that, while Board honorary officers are accountable to deputies, who themselves are accountable to their constituencies, the JLC had no such governance structure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/jewish-leadership-council-seeking-unified-communal-structure/|title=Jewish Leadership Council seeking \u2018unified communal structure\u2019|last=Millis|first=Joe|date=8 Jan 2019|accessdate=3 September 2018|work=Jewish News}}</ref> However, in March 2020, van de Zyl called in the ''The Jewish Chronicle'' for 'a more permanent unity' between the organisations.\n\n==Issues==\nThe issues which the Board states it addresses are:\n\n* Antisemitism and extremism\n* Israel and the Middle East\n* Education\n* Religious freedoms and inequalities\n* Interfaith and social action\n* International advocacy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bod.org.uk/issues/antisemitism-extremism/|title=Issues|accessdate=18 August 2019|work=Board of Deputies of British Jews}}</ref>\n\n==Events==\nIn 2003, the Board, on its website, reproduced an extract from a US State Department report that suggested that the aid organisation [[Palestinian Relief and Development Fund]] (Interpal) was helping to fund terrorist organisations.

The [[Balfour Declaration]] was addressed to him.]]\n[[File:Lord janner.jpg|thumb|right|[[Greville Janner]] was a president of the Board of Deputies during the late 20th century. He was also an MP, a member of the House of Lords and a leader of other Jewish organisations.]]\nThe most historically notable and longest-serving past president was the Victorian-era banker [[Moses Montefiore]], who in the nineteenth century travelled widely to assist Jewish communities in foreign countries, faced by persecution at the time.
