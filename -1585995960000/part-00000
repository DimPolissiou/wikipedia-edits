She played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man.\n\nThe film became both celebrated and notorious for showing the actress's face in the throes of an orgasm. According to Marie Benedict's book ''The Only Woman In The Room,'' Kiesler's expression resulted from someone sticking her with a pin. She was also shown in closeups and brief nude scenes, the latter reportedly a result of the actress being \"duped\" by the director and producer, who used high-power [[telephoto lens]]es.<ref name=Liberty>\"A Candid Portrait of Hedy Lamarr\", ''Liberty'' magazine, December 1938, pp. 18\u201319.</ref>{{efn|When Lamarr applied for the role, she had little experience nor understood the planned filming.

To calm her, he said they were using \"long shots\" in any case, and no intimate details would be visible. At the preview in Prague, sitting next to the director, when she saw the numerous close-ups produced with telephoto lenses, she screamed at him for tricking her.

She gained a role as an [[extra (acting)|extra]] in ''[[Money on the Street]]'' (1930), and then a small speaking part in ''[[Storm in a Water Glass]]'' (1931). Producer [[Max Reinhardt]] cast her in a play entitled ''The Weaker Sex'', which was performed at the [[Theater in der Josefstadt]].

She played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man.\n\nThe film became both celebrated and notorious for showing the actress's face in the throes of an orgasm. According to Marie Benedict's book ''The Only Woman In The Room,'' Kiesler's expression resulted from someone sticking her with a pin. She was also shown in closeups and brief nude scenes, the latter reportedly a result of the actress being \"duped\" by the director and producer, who used high-power [[telephoto lens]]es.<ref name=Liberty>\"A Candid Portrait of Hedy Lamarr\", ''Liberty'' magazine, December 1938, pp. 18\u201319.</ref>{{efn|When Lamarr applied for the role, she had little experience nor understood the planned filming. Anxious for the job, she signed the contract without reading it. When, during an outdoor scene, the director told her to disrobe, she protested and threatened to quit, but he said that if she refused, she would have to pay for the cost of all the scenes already filmed. To calm her, he said they were using \"long shots\" in any case, and no intimate details would be visible. At the preview in Prague, sitting next to the director, when she saw the numerous close-ups produced with telephoto lenses, she screamed at him for tricking her.

The fungus has been found in poultry house litter, caves, areas harboring bats, and in bird roosts (particularly those of [[starling]]s). The fungus is [[Thermally dimorphic fungus|thermally dimorphic]]: in the environment it grows as a brownish [[mycelium]], and at body temperature (37&nbsp;\u00b0C in humans) it morphs into a [[yeast]]. Histoplasmosis is not contagious, but is contracted by inhalation of the spores from disturbed soil or guano.<ref name=Sherris/> The inoculum is represented principally by [[microconidia]]. These are inhaled and reach the alveoli.\n\nIn the alveoli, macrophages ingest these microconidia. They survive inside the [[phagosome]]. As the fungus is thermally dimorphic, these microconidia are transformed into yeast. They grow and multiply inside the phagosome. The macrophages travel in lymphatic circulation and spread the disease to different organs.\n\nWithin the phagosome the fungus has an absolute requirement for [[thiamine]].<ref>Garfoot AL, Zemska O, Rappleye CA (2013) ''Histoplasma capsulatum'' depends on ''de novo'' vitamin biosynthesis for intraphagosomal proliferation. Infect Immum</ref>\nCell-mediated immunity for histoplasmosis develops within 2 weeks. If the patient has strong cellular immunity, macrophages, epithelial cells and lymphocytes surround the organisms and contain them, and eventually calcify. In immunocompromised individuals, the organisms disseminate to different organs such as bone, spleen, liver, adrenal glands and mucocutaneous membranes, resulting in [[progressive disseminated histoplasmosis]]. Chronic lung disease can manifest.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[Image:Chest X-ray acute pulmonary histoplasmosis PHIL 3954.jpg|thumb|[[Chest X-ray]] of a patient with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis]]\nClinically, there is a wide spectrum of disease manifestation, making diagnosis somewhat difficult. More severe forms include: (1) the chronic pulmonary form, often occurring in the presence of underlying pulmonary disease; and (2) a disseminated form, which is characterized by the progressive spread of infection to extra-pulmonary sites. Oral manifestations have been reported as the main complaint of the disseminated forms, leading the patient to seek treatment, whereas pulmonary symptoms in disseminated disease may be mild or even misinterpreted as flu.<ref>Braz\u00e3o-Silva MT, Mancusi GW, Bazzoun FV, Ishisaaki GY, Marcucci M.

Antigens can [[Cross-reactivity|cross-react]] with antigens of [[African histoplasmosis]] (caused by [[Histoplasma duboisii]]), [[blastomycosis]], [[coccidioidomycosis]], [[paracoccidioidomycosis]], and [[talaromycosis]] infection. Histoplasmosis can also be diagnosed by a test for [[antibodies]] against ''Histoplasma'' in the blood.  ''Histoplasma'' skin tests indicate whether a person has been exposed, but do not indicate whether they have the disease.<ref name=Sherris/> Formal histoplasmosis diagnoses are often confirmed only by culturing the fungus directly.<ref name=Robbins/> [[Sabouraud agar]] is one type of agar growth media on which the fungus can be cultured. Cutaneous manifestations of disseminated disease are diverse and often present as a nondescript rash with systemic complaints. Diagnosis is best established by urine antigen testing, as blood cultures may take up to 6 weeks for diagnostic growth to occur and serum antigen testing often comes back with a false negative before 4 weeks of disseminated infection.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 14700213 | volume=72 | issue=6 | title=Cutaneous histoplasmosis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome |date=December 2003 |vauthors=Rosenberg JD, Scheinfeld NS | journal=Cutis | pages=439\u201345}}</ref>\n\n=== Types ===\nHistoplasmosis may be divided into the following types:<ref name=\"Andrews\">{{cite book |author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|display-authors=etal}}</ref>{{rp|316\u2013317}}\n\n:* [[Primary pulmonary histoplasmosis]]\n:* [[Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis]]\n:* [[Primary cutaneous histoplasmosis]]\n:* [[African histoplasmosis]]\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii.

Antigens can [[Cross-reactivity|cross-react]] with antigens of [[African histoplasmosis]] (caused by [[Histoplasma duboisii]]), [[blastomycosis]], [[coccidioidomycosis]], [[paracoccidioidomycosis]], and [[talaromycosis]] infection. Histoplasmosis can also be diagnosed by a test for [[antibodies]] against ''Histoplasma'' in the blood.  ''Histoplasma'' skin tests indicate whether a person has been exposed, but do not indicate whether they have the disease.<ref name=Sherris/> Formal histoplasmosis diagnoses are often confirmed only by culturing the fungus directly.<ref name=Robbins/> [[Sabouraud agar]] is one type of agar growth media on which the fungus can be cultured. Cutaneous manifestations of disseminated disease are diverse and often present as a nondescript rash with systemic complaints. Diagnosis is best established by urine antigen testing, as blood cultures may take up to 6 weeks for diagnostic growth to occur and serum antigen testing often comes back with a false negative before 4 weeks of disseminated infection.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 14700213 | volume=72 | issue=6 | title=Cutaneous histoplasmosis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome |date=December 2003 |vauthors=Rosenberg JD, Scheinfeld NS | journal=Cutis | pages=439\u201345}}</ref>\n\n=== Types ===\nHistoplasmosis may be divided into the following types:<ref name=\"Andrews\">{{cite book |author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|display-authors=etal}}</ref>{{rp|316\u2013317}}\n\n:* [[Primary pulmonary histoplasmosis]]\n:* [[Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis]]\n:* [[Primary cutaneous histoplasmosis]]\n:* [[African histoplasmosis]]\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii.

It is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in certain areas of the [[United States]], particularly in states bordering the [[Ohio River|Ohio River valley]] and the lower [[Mississippi River]]. The humidity and acidity patterns of soil are associated with endemicity. Bird and bat droppings in soil promote growth of ''Histoplasma''. Contact with such soil aerosolizes the [[microconidia]], which can infect humans. It is also common in caves in southern and East Africa. Positive histoplasmin skin tests occur in as many as 90% of the people living in areas where ''H. capsulatum'' is common, such as the eastern and central United States.<ref name=Sherris/>\n\nIn Canada, the [[St. Lawrence River Valley]] is the site of the most frequent infections, with 20\u201330 percent of the population testing positive.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/diseases/histopla.html|title=Histoplasmosis|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= July 1, 2013 |website=www.ccohs.ca|language= |publisher=Canadian Centre for Occupational Health & Safety}}</ref>\n\nA review of reported cases in 2018 showed disease presence throughout South East Asia <ref> Baker J, Setianingrum F, Wahyuningsih R, Denning DW. \"Mapping histoplasmosis in South East Asia\u2013implications for diagnosis in AIDS.
