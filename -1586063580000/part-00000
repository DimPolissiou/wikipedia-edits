The Liberal Democrats won the equivalent [[Cardiff Central (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Welsh Assembly seat]] in 1999 and 2003 and also dominate the wards which make up the seat in elections to [[Cardiff Council]].\n\nThe constituency is socially diverse, with both very affluent and very deprived areas. It has a large student population which seems to have helped Labour to win in 1992 and 1997 but thereafter increasingly switched to the Liberal Democrats due to opposition to government plans for reforming student support. This switched yet again in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] where students were disillusioned by the broken promises the Liberal Democrats made regarding tuition fees. This was despite the fact that these student loan promises did not apply to Wales, which has a different funding system and MP Jenny Willott had also voted against the English changes in Parliament.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/lib-dem-jenny-willott-loses-9043442|title=Lib Dem Jenny Willott loses to Labour in Cardiff Central|last=Dewey|first=Philip|date=8 May 2015|website=WalesOnline|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe seat was unchanged in the Fifth Periodical Report of the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for Wales, which took effect at the 2010 general election.\n\nSince the seat's re-creation in 1983, it has been held successively by each of the three main political parties; the Liberal Democrats gained it at the 2005 election after 13 years of Labour representation.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\n=== MPs 1918\u20131950 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{cite web|title=Cardiff Central 1918\u20131950|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/constituencies/cardiff-central|website=Hansard 1803\u20132005|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|c|2|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!Party\n|-\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n| [[James Childs Gould]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]]\n| [[Lewis Lougher]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[Ernest Nathaniel Bennett|Ernest Bennett]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{National Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]]\n| [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]]\n| [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|\n| [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]]\n|colspan=\"2\"| ''constituency abolished''\n|}\n\n=== MPs since 1983 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref name=\"rayment\"/>!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]\n| [[Ian Grist]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Co-operative/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| [[Jon Owen Jones]]\n| [[Labour Party UK|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Liberal Democrats (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]]\n| [[Jenny Willott]]\n| [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]\n| [[Jo Stevens]]\n| [[Labour Party UK|Labour]]\n|}\n\n==Election results==\n===Elections 1983 to current ===\n====Elections in the 2010s====\n{{Election box begin|title=[[2019 United Kingdom general election|General election 2019]]: Cardiff Central<ref>{{cite web |title=Scheduled elections and polls |url=https://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ENG/Your-Council/Voting-and-elections/Scheduled-elections-and-polls/Documents/Statement%20of%20Persons%20Nominated%20-%20Cardiff%20Central%20%28Updated%29.pdf |website=Cardiff Council |publisher=Cardiff Council |accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=2019results>{{cite|url=https://cardiff.moderngov.co.uk/mgElectionAreaResults.aspx?XXR=0&ID=123&RPID=1020051&LLL=0|publisher=Cardiff Council|title=Election results for Cardiff Central, UK Parliamentary Election -

[[borough constituency]] in the city of [[Cardiff]]. It returns one Member of Parliament (MP) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], elected by the [[first past the post]] system.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1918\u20131950''': The County Borough of Cardiff wards of Canton, Cathays, Central, and Riverside.\n\n'''1983\u20132010''': The City of Cardiff wards of Adamsdown, Cathays, Cyncoed, Pentwyn, Plasnewydd, and Roath.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Cardiff electoral divisions of Adamsdown, Cathays, Cyncoed, Pentwyn, Penylan, and Plasnewydd.\n\nAs its name suggests, Cardiff Central covers the central area of the City of [[Cardiff]]. It extends from the area around the [[Millennium Stadium]] in the south to [[Llanishen]] Golf Course in the north, taking in the [[Cardiff city centre|City Centre]] and the [[Cardiff University|University]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cardiff/2010/dec/09/cardiff-central-mp-jenny-willott-resigns-tuition-fees|title=Cardiff Central MP Jenny Willott resigns over tuition fees|first=Hannah|last=Waldram|date=9 December 2010|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThis was a Conservative-held three-way marginal constituency throughout the 1980s but since 1997 Labour and the Liberal Democrats have pushed the Conservative candidate into third place. The Liberal Democrats won the equivalent [[Cardiff Central (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Welsh Assembly seat]] in 1999 and 2003 and also dominate the wards which make up the seat in elections to [[Cardiff Council]].\n\nThe constituency is socially diverse, with both very affluent and very deprived areas. It has a large student population which seems to have helped Labour to win in 1992 and 1997 but thereafter increasingly switched to the Liberal Democrats due to opposition to government plans for reforming student support. This switched yet again in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] where students were disillusioned by the broken promises the Liberal Democrats made regarding tuition fees. This was despite the fact that these student loan promises did not apply to Wales, which has a different funding system and MP Jenny Willott had also voted against the English changes in Parliament.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/lib-dem-jenny-willott-loses-9043442|title=Lib Dem Jenny Willott loses to Labour in Cardiff Central|last=Dewey|first=Philip|date=8 May 2015|website=WalesOnline|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe seat was unchanged in the Fifth Periodical Report of the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for Wales, which took effect at the 2010 general election.\n\nSince the seat's re-creation in 1983, it has been held successively by each of the three main political parties; the Liberal Democrats gained it at the 2005 election after 13 years of Labour representation.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\n=== MPs 1918\u20131950 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{cite web|title=Cardiff Central 1918\u20131950|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/constituencies/cardiff-central|website=Hansard 1803\u20132005|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|c|2|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!Party\n|-\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n| [[James Childs Gould]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]]\n| [[Lewis Lougher]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[Ernest Nathaniel Bennett|Ernest Bennett]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{National Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]]\n| [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]]\n| [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|\n| [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]]\n|colspan=\"2\"| ''constituency abolished''\n|}\n\n=== MPs since 1983 ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref name=\"rayment\"/>!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]\n| [[Ian Grist]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Co-operative/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| [[Jon Owen Jones]]\n| [[Labour Party UK|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Liberal Democrats (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]]\n| [[Jenny Willott]]\n| [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]\n| [[Jo Stevens]]\n| [[Labour Party UK|Labour]]\n|}\n\n==Election results==\n===Elections 1983 to current ===\n====Elections in the 2010s====\n{{Election box begin|title=[[2019 United Kingdom general election|General election 2019]]: Cardiff Central<ref>{{cite web |title=Scheduled elections and polls |url=https://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ENG/Your-Council/Voting-and-elections/Scheduled-elections-and-polls/Documents/Statement%20of%20Persons%20Nominated%20-%20Cardiff%20Central%20%28Updated%29.pdf |website=Cardiff Council |publisher=Cardiff Council |accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=2019results>{{cite|url=https://cardiff.moderngov.co.uk/mgElectionAreaResults.aspx?XXR=0&ID=123&RPID=1020051&LLL=0|publisher=Cardiff Council|title=Election results for Cardiff Central, UK Parliamentary Election -

Original plate (left) & [[Film colorization|colorized]] reoriented enhancement (right).]]\nBecause Ni\u00e9pce's camera photographs required an extremely long [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] (at least eight hours and probably several days), he sought to greatly improve his [[Bitumen of Judea|bitumen]] process or replace it with one that was more practical. In partnership with [[Louis Daguerre]], he worked out post-exposure processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more light-sensitive resin, but hours of exposure in the camera were still required. With an eye to eventual commercial exploitation, the partners opted for total secrecy.\n\nNi\u00e9pce died in 1833 and Daguerre then redirected the experiments toward the light-sensitive [[silver halide]]s, which Ni\u00e9pce had abandoned many years earlier because of his inability to make the images he captured with them light-fast and permanent. Daguerre's efforts culminated in what would later be named the [[daguerreotype]] process. The essential elements\u2014a silver-plated surface sensitized by [[iodine]] vapor, developed by [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor, and \"fixed\" with hot saturated [[sodium chloride|salt]] water\u2014were in place in 1837. The required exposure time was measured in minutes instead of hours. Daguerre took the earliest confirmed photograph of a person in 1838 while capturing a view of a Paris street: unlike the other pedestrian and horse-drawn traffic on the busy boulevard, which appears deserted, one man having his boots polished stood sufficiently still throughout the several-minutes-long exposure to be visible. The existence of Daguerre's process was publicly announced, without details, on 7 January 1839. The news created an international sensation. France soon agreed to pay Daguerre a pension in exchange for the right to present his invention to the world as the gift of France, which occurred when complete working instructions were unveiled on 19 August 1839. In that same year, American photographer [[Robert Cornelius]] is credited with taking the earliest surviving photographic self-portrait.\n\n[[File:Latticed window at lacock abbey 1835.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A latticed window in [[Lacock Abbey]], England, photographed by [[William Fox Talbot]] in 1835.

After reading about Daguerre's invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot's paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures in the camera, but in 1840 he created the [[calotype]] process, which used the [[photographic processing|chemical development]] of a [[latent image]] to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype. In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot's process, unlike Daguerre's, created a translucent [[negative (photography)|negative]] which could be used to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/fox_talbot_william_henry.shtml William Henry Fox Talbot (1800\u20131877)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003154557/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/fox_talbot_william_henry.shtml |date=3 October 2010}}.

He invented the [[cyanotype]] process, later familiar as the \"blueprint\". He was the first to use the terms \"photography\", \"negative\" and \"positive\". He had discovered in 1819 that [[sodium thiosulphate]] was a solvent of silver halides, and in 1839 he informed Talbot (and, indirectly, Daguerre) that it could be used to \"fix\" silver-halide-based photographs and make them completely light-fast. He made the first [[glass negative]] in late 1839.\n\n<!--[[File:Daguerreotype tintype photographer model studio table brady stand cast iron portrait photos.jpg|right|thumb|Mid-19th-century \"Brady stand\" photo model's armrest table, meant to keep portrait models still during long exposure times (studio equipment nicknamed after the famed US photographer, [[Mathew Brady]]).]] \u2013 remove, not mentioned in body-->\nIn the March 1851 issue of ''The Chemist'', [[Frederick Scott Archer]] published his wet plate [[collodion process]]. It became the most widely used photographic medium until the gelatin dry plate, introduced in the 1870s, eventually replaced it. There are three subsets to the collodion process; the [[Ambrotype]] (a positive image on glass), the [[Ferrotype]] or Tintype (a positive image on metal) and the glass negative, which was used to make positive prints on [[albumen]] or salted paper.\n\nMany advances in [[Photographic plate|photographic glass plates]] and printing were made during the rest of the 19th century. In 1891, [[Gabriel Lippmann]] introduced a process for making natural-color photographs based on the optical phenomenon of the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of light waves. His scientifically elegant and important but ultimately impractical invention earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908.\n\nGlass plates were the medium for most original camera photography from the late 1850s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the 1890s. Although the convenience of the film greatly popularized amateur photography, early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their glass plate equivalents, and until the late 1910s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers, so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old. Because of the superior dimensional stability of glass, the use of plates for some scientific applications, such as [[astrophotography]], continued into the 1990s, and in the niche field of laser [[holography]], it has persisted into the 2010s.\n\n=== Film ===\n{{Main|Photographic film}}\n[[File:undeveloped film.png|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Undeveloped Arista black-and-white film, [[Film speed|ISO]] 125/22\u00b0]]\n\n[[Hurter and Driffield]] began pioneering work on the [[sensitometry|light sensitivity]] of photographic emulsions in 1876. Their work enabled the first quantitative measure of film speed to be devised.\n\nThe first flexible photographic roll film was marketed by [[Eastman Kodak|George Eastman]], founder of [[Kodak]] in 1885, but this original \"film\" was actually a coating on a paper base. As part of the processing, the image-bearing layer was stripped from the paper and transferred to a hardened gelatin support. The first transparent plastic roll film followed in 1889.<!--am leaving this date untouched, but it is a matter of some controversy--> It was made from highly flammable [[nitrocellulose]] (\"[[celluloid]]\"), now usually called \"[[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]]\".\n\nAlthough [[cellulose acetate]] or \"[[safety film]]\" had been introduced by Kodak in 1908,<ref>[http://www.kodak.com/global/en/corp/historyOfKodak/1878.jhtml History of Kodak, Milestones-chronology: 1878\u20131929] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210123011/http://www.kodak.com/global/en/corp/historyOfKodak/1878.jhtml |date=10 February 2012}}. kodak.com</ref> at first it found only a few special applications as an alternative to the hazardous nitrate film, which had the advantages of being considerably tougher, slightly more transparent, and cheaper.

The [[albumen print]] process first used more than {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1847|1|1}}|-1}} years ago, produces brownish tones.\n\nMany photographers continue to produce some monochrome images, sometimes because of the established archival permanence of well-processed silver-halide-based materials. Some full-color digital images are processed using a variety of techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome. Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; sometimes when presented as black-and-white or single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective. Although color photography has long predominated, monochrome images are still produced, mostly for artistic reasons. Almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome, and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard [[RGB color model|RGB]] color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.\n\n=== Color ===\n{{Main|Color photography}}\n[[File:Tartan Ribbon.jpg|thumb|The first [[color photograph]] made by the three-color method suggested by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1855, taken in 1861 by [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]].

Early experiments in color required extremely long exposures (hours or days for camera images) and could not \"fix\" the photograph to prevent the color from quickly fading when exposed to white light.\n\nThe first permanent color photograph was taken in 1861 using the three-color-separation principle first published by Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1855.<ref name=\"King's College\">{{cite news\n| title        = 1861: James Clerk Maxwell's greatest year\n| url          = https://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2011/04Apr/JamesClerkMaxwell.aspx\n| publisher    = King's College London\n| date         = 3 January 2017\n| access-date  = 3 January 2017\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170104000418/https://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2011/04Apr/JamesClerkMaxwell.aspx\n| archive-date = 4 January 2017\n| url-status   = live\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Maxwell\">{{cite news\n| title        = From Charles Mackintosh's waterproof to Dolly the sheep: 43 innovations Scotland has given the world\n| url          = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/charles-mackintosh-chemist-waterproof-google-doodle-scotland-inventions-innovation-bicycles-a7499911.html\n| publisher    = The independent\n| date         = 2 January 2016\n| access-date  = 2 December 2017\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171002171029/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/charles-mackintosh-chemist-waterproof-google-doodle-scotland-inventions-innovation-bicycles-a7499911.html\n| archive-date = 2 October 2017\n| url-status   = live\n}}</ref> The foundation of virtually all practical color processes, Maxwell's idea was to take three separate black-and-white photographs through red, green and blue [[filter (photography)|filters]].<ref name=\"King's College\" /><ref name=\"Maxwell\" /> This provides the photographer with the three basic channels required to recreate a color image. Transparent prints of the images could be projected through similar color filters and superimposed on the projection screen, an [[additive color|additive method]] of color reproduction. A color print on paper could be produced by superimposing [[carbon print]]s of the three images made in their [[complementary color]]s, a [[subtractive color|subtractive method]] of color reproduction pioneered by [[Louis Ducos du Hauron]] in the late 1860s.\n[[File:Colonel William Willoughby Verner, Sanger Shepherd process, by Sarah Acland 1903.png|thumb|left|Color photography was possible long before [[Kodachrome]], as this 1903 portrait by [[Sarah Angelina Acland]] demonstrates, but in its earliest years, the need for special equipment, long exposures, and complicated printing processes made it extremely rare.]]\nRussian photographer [[Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii]] made extensive use of this color separation technique, employing a special camera which successively exposed the three color-filtered images on different parts of an oblong [[photographic plate|plate]]. Because his exposures were not simultaneous, unsteady subjects exhibited color \"fringes\" or, if rapidly moving through the scene, appeared as brightly colored ghosts in the resulting projected or printed images.\n\nImplementation of color photography was hindered by the limited sensitivity of early photographic materials, which were mostly sensitive to blue, only slightly sensitive to green, and virtually insensitive to red. The discovery of dye sensitization by photochemist [[Hermann W. Vogel|Hermann Vogel]] in 1873 suddenly made it possible to add sensitivity to green, yellow and even red. Improved color sensitizers and ongoing improvements in the overall sensitivity of [[Photographic emulsion|emulsions]] steadily reduced the once-prohibitive long exposure times required for color, bringing it ever closer to commercial viability.\n\n[[Autochrome]], the first commercially successful color process, was introduced by the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] in 1907. Autochrome [[photographic plate|plates]] incorporated a [[mosaic]] color filter layer made of dyed grains of [[potato starch]], which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments. After an Autochrome plate was [[reversal film|reversal processed]] to produce a positive [[reversal film|transparency]], the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and the tiny colored points blended together in the eye, synthesizing the color of the subject by the [[additive color|additive method]]. Autochrome plates were one of several varieties of additive color screen plates and films marketed between the 1890s and the 1950s.\n\n[[Kodachrome]], the first modern \"integral tripack\" (or \"monopack\") color film, was introduced by [[Kodak]] in 1935. It captured the three color components in a multi-layer [[Photographic emulsion|emulsion]]. One layer was sensitized to record the red-dominated part of the [[visible spectrum|spectrum]], another layer recorded only the green part and a third recorded only the blue. Without special [[film processing]], the result would simply be three superimposed black-and-white images, but [[complementary color|complementary]] cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images were created in those layers by adding [[color coupler]]s during a complex processing procedure.\n\n[[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa's]] similarly structured [[Agfacolor]] Neu was introduced in 1936. Unlike Kodachrome, the color couplers in Agfacolor Neu were incorporated into the emulsion layers during manufacture, which greatly simplified the processing. Currently, available color films still employ a multi-layer emulsion and the same principles, most closely resembling Agfa's product.\n\n[[Instant film|Instant color film]], used in a special camera which yielded a unique finished color print only a minute or two after the exposure, was introduced by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] in 1963.\n\nColor photography may form images as positive transparencies, which can be used in a [[slide projector]], or as color negatives intended for use in creating positive color enlargements on specially coated paper. The latter is now the most common form of film (non-digital) color photography owing to the introduction of automated photo printing equipment. After a transition period centered around 1995\u20132005, color film was relegated to a niche market by inexpensive multi-megapixel digital cameras. Film continues to be the preference of some photographers because of its distinctive \"look\".\n\n=== Digital ===\n{{Main|Digital photography}}\n{{See also|Digital camera}}\n[[File:Early digital!.jpg|thumb|201x201px|Kodak DCS 100, based on a [[Nikon F3]] body with Digital Storage Unit]]\nIn 1981, [[Sony]] unveiled the first consumer camera to use a [[charge-coupled device]] for imaging, eliminating the need for film: the [[Sony Mavica]]. While the Mavica saved images to disk, the images were displayed on television, and the camera was not fully digital.\n\nThe first digital camera to both record and save images in a digital format was the Fujix DS-1P created by Fujfilm in 1988.<ref>https://www.fujifilm.com/innovation/achievements/ds-1p/</ref> https://www.fujifilm.com/innovation/achievements/ds-1p/\n\nIn 1991, Kodak unveiled the [[DCS 100]], the first commercially available digital single lens reflex camera. Although its high cost precluded uses other than [[photojournalism]] and professional photography, commercial [[digital photography]] was born.\n\nDigital imaging uses an electronic [[image sensor]] to record the image as a set of electronic data rather than as chemical changes on film.<ref>Schewe, Jeff (2012). The Digital Negative: Raw Image Processing In Lightroom, Camera Raw, and Photoshop. Berkeley, CA: Peachpit Press, {{ISBN|0-321-83957-9}}, p. 72</ref> An important difference between digital and chemical photography is that chemical photography resists [[photo manipulation]] because it involves [[photographic film|film]] and [[photographic paper]], while digital imaging is a highly manipulative medium. This difference allows for a degree of image post-processing that is comparatively difficult in film-based photography and permits different communicative potentials and applications.\n\nDigital photography dominates the 21st century. More than 99% of photographs taken around the world are through digital cameras, increasingly through smartphones.\n\n=== Synthesis ===\nSynthesis photography is part of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) where the shooting process is modeled on real photography. The CGI, creating digital copies of real universe, requires a visual representation process of these universes. Synthesis photography is the application of [[Analog photography|analog]] and [[digital photography]] in digital space. With the characteristics of the real photography but not being constrained by the physical limits of real world, synthesis photography allows artists to move into areas beyond the grasp of real photography.<ref>{{cite conference\n| url         = http://www.zhongart.com/marcol/premier/photoA_files/synthesis%20photography%20and%20architecture.html\n| title       = Synthesis photography and architecture\n| last1       = Paux\n| first1      = Marc-Olivier\n| date        = 1 February 2011\n| conference  = [[Imagina]]\n| location    = Monaco\n| url-status  = dead\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092825/http://www.zhongart.com/marcol/premier/photoA_files/synthesis%20photography%20and%20architecture.html\n| archivedate = 2 April 2015\n| df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Techniques ==\n[[File:San Francisco brutalism.jpg|thumb|Angles such as vertical, horizontal, or as pictured here diagonal are considered important photographic techniques]]\nA large variety of photographic techniques and media are used in the process of capturing images for photography.

[[Digital photography|Digital cameras]] use an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive electronics such as [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) or [[complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (CMOS) technology. The resulting digital image is stored electronically, but can be reproduced on a paper.\n\nThe camera (or '[[camera obscura]]') is a dark room or chamber from which, as far as possible, all light is excluded except the light that forms the image. It was discovered and used in the 16th century by painters. The subject being photographed, however, must be illuminated. Cameras can range from small to very large, a whole room that is kept dark while the object to be photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated. This was common for reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were used (see [[Process camera]]).\n\nAs soon as photographic materials became \"fast\" (sensitive) enough for taking [[Candid photography|candid]] or surreptitious pictures, small \"detective\" cameras were made, some actually disguised as a book or handbag or pocket watch (the ''Ticka'' camera) or even worn hidden behind an [[Ascot tie|Ascot]] necktie with a tie pin that was really the lens.\n\nThe [[movie camera]] is a type of photographic camera which takes a rapid sequence of photographs on recording medium. In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot at a time, the movie camera takes a series of images, each called a \"frame\". This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism. The frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific speed, called the \"frame rate\" (number of frames per second). While viewing, a person's eyes and brain merge the separate pictures to create the illusion of motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n| url         = http://www.uca.edu/org/ccsmi/ccsmi/classicwork/Myth%20Revisited.htm\n| author1     = Anderson, Joseph\n| author2     = Anderson, Barbara\n| title       = The Myth of Persistence of Vision Revisited\n| journal     = Journal of Film and Video\n| volume      = 45\n| issue       = 1\n| date        = Spring 1993\n| pages       = 3\u201312\n| url-status  = dead\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091124182503/http://www.uca.edu/org/ccsmi/ccsmi/classicwork/Myth%20Revisited.htm\n| archivedate = 24 November 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereoscopic ===\n{{Main|Stereoscopy}}\nPhotographs, both monochrome and color, can be captured and displayed through two side-by-side images that emulate human stereoscopic vision.

The dualphoto apparatus can be used to simultaneously capture both the subject and the photographer, or both sides of a geographical place at once, thus adding a supplementary narrative layer to that of a single image.<ref>{{cite news\n| title        = An introduction to Dualphotography\n| first        = Tristan\n| last         = Zand\n| url          = https://medium.com/dualphoto/an-introduction-to-dualphotography-b17f02049bbf\n| publisher    = Medium.com\n| work         = Dual.Photo\n| date         = 8 April 2017\n| access-date  = 15 April 2017\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170416044530/https://medium.com/dualphoto/an-introduction-to-dualphotography-b17f02049bbf\n| archive-date = 16 April 2017\n| url-status   = live\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Full-spectrum, ultraviolet and infrared ===\n{{Main|Full spectrum photography}}\n[[File:Saturn's Rings in Ultraviolet Light.png|thumb|This image of the [[rings of Saturn]] is an example of the application of [[ultraviolet photography]] in [[ultraviolet astronomy|astronomy]]]]\n\n[[Ultraviolet photography|Ultraviolet]] and [[infrared photography|infrared]] films have been available for many decades and employed in a variety of photographic avenues since the 1960s. New technological trends in digital photography have opened a new direction in [[full spectrum photography]], where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet, visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions.\n\nModified digital cameras can detect some ultraviolet, all of the visible and much of the near infrared spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350&nbsp;nm to 1000&nbsp;nm. An off-the-shelf digital camera contains an infrared [[hot mirror]] filter that blocks most of the infrared and a bit of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400&nbsp;nm to 700&nbsp;nm.<ref>Twede, David.

Without the hot-mirror, the red, green and blue (or cyan, yellow and magenta) colored micro-filters placed over the sensor elements pass varying amounts of ultraviolet (blue window) and infrared (primarily red and somewhat lesser the green and blue micro-filters).\n\nUses of full spectrum photography are for [[fine art photography]], [[Remote sensing#Geodetic|geology]], [[History of forensic photography|forensics]] and law enforcement.\n\n=== Light field ===\n{{See also|Light-field camera}}\nDigital methods of image capture and display processing have enabled the new technology of \"light field photography\" (also known as synthetic aperture photography). This process allows focusing at various depths of field to be selected ''after'' the photograph has been captured.<ref>[[Ren Ng|Ng, Ren]] (July 2006) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120916121457/http://www.lytro.com/renng-thesis.pdf Digital Light Field Photography]. PhD Thesis, Stanford University</ref> As explained by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1846, the \"[[light field]]\" is understood as 5-dimensional, with each point in 3-D space having attributes of two more angles that define the direction of each ray passing through that point.\n\nThese additional vector attributes can be captured optically through the use of microlenses at each pixel point within the 2-dimensional image sensor. Every pixel of the final image is actually a selection from each sub-array located under each microlens, as identified by a post-image capture focus algorithm.\n\n[[File:M\u00fc\u00fcrlooga (Arabidopsis thaliana) lehekarv (trihhoom) 311 0804.JPG|thumb|Devices other than cameras can be used to record images.

For instance, a [[photocopy]] or [[xerography]] machine forms permanent images but uses the transfer of static [[Electric charge|electrical charges]] rather than photographic medium, hence the term [[electrophotography]]. [[Photogram]]s are images produced by the shadows of objects cast on the photographic paper, without the use of a camera. Objects can also be placed directly on the glass of an [[image scanner]] to produce digital pictures.\n\n== Types of photography ==\n===Amateur=== <!-- \"Amateur photography\" redirects here. -->\nAn amateur photographer is one who practices photography as a [[hobby]]/[[Passion (emotion)|passion]] and not necessarily for profit. The quality of some amateur work is comparable to that of many professionals and may be highly specialized or [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] in choice of subjects. Amateur photography is often pre-eminent in photographic subjects which have little prospect of commercial use or reward. Amateur photography grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the hand-held camera.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi     = 10.1080/03087298.2011.606727\n| title   = Home Portraiture\n| journal = History of Photography\n| volume  = 35\n| issue   = 4\n| pages   = 374\u201387\n| year    = 2011\n| last1   = Peterson\n| first1  = C.A.\n}}</ref> Nowadays it has spread widely through social media and is carried out throughout different platforms and equipment, switching to the use of cell phone.

In this light, money could be paid for the subject of the photograph or the photograph itself. Wholesale, retail, and professional uses of photography would fall under this definition. The commercial photographic world could include:\n* Advertising photography: photographs made to illustrate and usually sell a service or product. These images, such as [[packshot]]s, are generally done with an [[advertising agency]], [[design firm]] or with an in-house corporate design team.\n* Fashion and glamour photography usually incorporates [[photographic model|models]] and is a form of advertising photography. [[Fashion photography]], like the work featured in ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', emphasizes clothes and other products; glamour emphasizes the model and body form. Glamour photography is popular in advertising and [[men's magazine]]s. Models in [[glamour photography]] sometimes work [[Nude photography|nude]].\n* [[360 product photography]] displays a series of photos to give the impression of a rotating object. This technique is commonly used by ecommerce websites to help shoppers visualise products.\n* [[Concert photography]] focuses on capturing candid images of both the artist or band as well as the atmosphere (including the crowd). Many of these photographers work freelance and are contracted through an artist or their management to cover a specific show. Concert photographs are often used to promote the artist or band in addition to the venue.\n* [[Crime scene photography]] consists of photographing scenes of crime such as robberies and murders. A black and white camera or an [[infrared camera]] may be used to capture specific details.\n* [[Still life photography]] usually depicts inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects which may be either natural or man-made. Still life is a broader category for food and some natural photography and can be used for advertising purposes.\n* Real Estate photography focuses on the production of photographs showcasing a property that is for sale, such photographs requires the use of wide-lens and extensive knowledge in [[High-dynamic-range imaging]] photography.\n[[File:Cheese and Tomatoes.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a studio-made food photograph.]]\n* [[Food photography]] can be used for editorial, packaging or advertising use. Food photography is similar to still life photography but requires some special skills.\n* [[Photojournalism]] can be considered a subset of editorial photography. Photographs made in this context are accepted as a documentation of a news story.\n* [[Paparazzi]] is a form of photojournalism in which the photographer captures candid images of athletes, celebrities, politicians, and other prominent people.\n* [[Portrait photography|Portrait]] and [[wedding photography]]: photographs made and sold directly to the end user of the images.\n* [[Landscape photography]] depicts locations.\n* [[Wildlife photography]] demonstrates the life of animals.\n\n=== Art ===\n[[File:Alfred Stieglitz - The Steerage - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Classic [[Alfred Stieglitz]] photograph, ''[[The Steerage]]'' shows unique aesthetic of black-and-white photos.]]\n\nDuring the 20th century, both [[fine art photography]] and [[documentary photography]] became accepted by the [[English language|English-speaking]] art world and the [[art gallery|gallery]] system. In the United States, a handful of photographers, including [[Alfred Stieglitz]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[John Szarkowski]], [[F. Holland Day]], and [[Edward Weston]], spent their lives advocating for photography as a fine art.\nAt first, fine art photographers tried to imitate painting styles. This movement is called [[Pictorialism]], often using [[soft focus]] for a dreamy, 'romantic' look. In reaction to that, Weston, [[Ansel Adams]], and others formed the [[Group f/64]] to advocate '[[straight photography]]', the photograph as a (sharply focused) thing in itself and not an imitation of something else.\n\nThe [[aesthetics]] of photography is a matter that continues to be discussed regularly, especially in artistic circles. Many artists argued that photography was the mechanical reproduction of an image. If photography is authentically art, then photography in the context of art would need redefinition, such as determining what component of a photograph makes it [[beauty|beautiful]] to the viewer. The controversy began with the earliest images \"written with light\"; [[Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]], [[Louis Daguerre]], and others among the very earliest photographers were met with acclaim, but some questioned if their work met the definitions and purposes of art.\n\n[[Clive Bell]] in his classic essay ''Art'' states that only \"significant form\" can distinguish art from what is not art.\n\n{{quote|There must be some one quality without which a work of art cannot exist; possessing which, in the least degree, no work is altogether worthless.

Even though what is depicted in the photographs are real objects, the subject is strictly abstract.\n\n=== Photojournalism ===\n{{Main|Photojournalism}}\nPhotojournalism is a particular form of photography (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that employs images in order to tell a news story. It is now usually understood to refer only to still images, but in some cases the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (e.g., documentary photography, social documentary photography, [[street photography]] or [[celebrity photography]]) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media, and help communities connect with one other. Photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door.

The camera also proved useful in recording [[crime scene]]s and the scenes of accidents, such as the [[Wootton bridge collapse]] in 1861. The methods used in analysing photographs for use in legal cases are collectively known as [[forensic photography]]. Crime scene photos are taken from three vantage point. The vantage points are overview, mid-range, and close-up.<ref>Rohde, R.R. (2000). Crime Photography.

Different machines produced 12- or 24- hour photographic traces of the minute-by-minute variations of [[atmospheric pressure]], temperature, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric electricity]], and the three components of [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic forces]].

In her ''[[On Photography]]'' (1977), [[Susan Sontag]] dismisses the objectivity of photography. This is a highly debated subject within the photographic community.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last    = Bissell\n| first   = K.L.\n| date    = 2000\n| title   = A Return to 'Mr. Gates': Photography and Objectivity\n| journal = Newspaper Research Journal\n| doi     = 10.1177/073953290002100307\n| volume  = 21\n| issue   = 3\n| pages   = 81\u201393\n}}</ref> Sontag argues, \"To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting one's self into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge, and therefore like power.\"<ref name=\"Sontag\">Sontag, S. (1977) ''[[On Photography]]'', Penguin, London, pp. 3\u201324, {{ISBN|0-312-42009-9}}.</ref> Photographers decide what to take a photo of, what elements to exclude and what angle to frame the photo, and these factors may reflect a particular socio-historical context. Along these lines, it can be argued that photography is a subjective form of representation.\n\nModern photography has raised a number of concerns on its effect on society. In [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), the camera is presented as promoting voyeurism. 'Although the camera is an observation station, the act of photographing is more than passive observing'.<ref name=\"Sontag\" />\n\n<blockquote>\nThe camera doesn't rape or even possess, though it may presume, intrude, trespass, distort, exploit, and, at the farthest reach of metaphor, assassinate \u2013 all activities that, unlike the sexual push and shove, can be conducted from a distance, and with some detachment.<ref name=\"Sontag\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nDigital imaging has raised ethical concerns because of the ease of manipulating digital photographs in post-processing. Many photojournalists have declared they will not [[cropping|crop]] their pictures or are forbidden from combining elements of multiple photos to make \"[[photomontage]]s\", passing them as \"real\" photographs. Today's technology has made [[image editing]] relatively simple for even the novice photographer. However, recent changes of in-camera processing allow digital fingerprinting of photos to detect tampering for purposes of [[forensic photography]].\n\nPhotography is one of the new media forms that changes perception and changes the structure of society.<ref>Levinson, P. (1997) ''The Soft Edge: a Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution'', Routledge, London and New York, pp. 37\u201348, {{ISBN|0-415-15785-4}}.</ref> Further unease has been caused around cameras in regards to desensitization. Fears that disturbing or explicit images are widely accessible to children and society at large have been raised. Particularly, photos of war and pornography are causing a stir. Sontag is concerned that \"to photograph is to turn people into objects that can be symbolically possessed.\" Desensitization discussion goes hand in hand with debates about censored images. Sontag writes of her concern that the ability to censor pictures means the photographer has the ability to construct reality.<ref name=\"Sontag\" />\n\nOne of the practices through which photography constitutes society is tourism.

Original plate (left) & [[Film colorization|colorized]] reoriented enhancement (right).]]\nBecause Ni\u00e9pce's camera photographs required an extremely long [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] (at least eight hours and probably several days), he sought to greatly improve his [[Bitumen of Judea|bitumen]] process or replace it with one that was more practical. In partnership with [[Louis Daguerre]], he worked out post-exposure processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more light-sensitive resin, but hours of exposure in the camera were still required. With an eye to eventual commercial exploitation, the partners opted for total secrecy.\n\nNi\u00e9pce died in 1833 and Daguerre then redirected the experiments toward the light-sensitive [[silver halide]]s, which Ni\u00e9pce had abandoned many years earlier because of his inability to make the images he captured with them light-fast and permanent. Daguerre's efforts culminated in what would later be named the [[daguerreotype]] process. The essential elements\u2014a silver-plated surface sensitized by [[iodine]] vapor, developed by [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor, and \"fixed\" with hot saturated [[sodium chloride|salt]] water\u2014were in place in 1837. The required exposure time was measured in minutes instead of hours. Daguerre took the earliest confirmed photograph of a person in 1838 while capturing a view of a Paris street: unlike the other pedestrian and horse-drawn traffic on the busy boulevard, which appears deserted, one man having his boots polished stood sufficiently still throughout the several-minutes-long exposure to be visible. The existence of Daguerre's process was publicly announced, without details, on 7 January 1839. The news created an international sensation. France soon agreed to pay Daguerre a pension in exchange for the right to present his invention to the world as the gift of France, which occurred when complete working instructions were unveiled on 19 August 1839. In that same year, American photographer [[Robert Cornelius]] is credited with taking the earliest surviving photographic self-portrait.\n\n[[File:Latticed window at lacock abbey 1835.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A latticed window in [[Lacock Abbey]], England, photographed by [[William Fox Talbot]] in 1835.

After reading about Daguerre's invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot's paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures in the camera, but in 1840 he created the [[calotype]] process, which used the [[photographic processing|chemical development]] of a [[latent image]] to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype. In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot's process, unlike Daguerre's, created a translucent [[negative (photography)|negative]] which could be used to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/fox_talbot_william_henry.shtml William Henry Fox Talbot (1800\u20131877)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003154557/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/fox_talbot_william_henry.shtml |date=3 October 2010}}.

He invented the [[cyanotype]] process, later familiar as the \"blueprint\". He was the first to use the terms \"photography\", \"negative\" and \"positive\". He had discovered in 1819 that [[sodium thiosulphate]] was a solvent of silver halides, and in 1839 he informed Talbot (and, indirectly, Daguerre) that it could be used to \"fix\" silver-halide-based photographs and make them completely light-fast. He made the first [[glass negative]] in late 1839.\n\n<!--[[File:Daguerreotype tintype photographer model studio table brady stand cast iron portrait photos.jpg|right|thumb|Mid-19th-century \"Brady stand\" photo model's armrest table, meant to keep portrait models still during long exposure times (studio equipment nicknamed after the famed US photographer, [[Mathew Brady]]).]] \u2013 remove, not mentioned in body-->\nIn the March 1851 issue of ''The Chemist'', [[Frederick Scott Archer]] published his wet plate [[collodion process]]. It became the most widely used photographic medium until the gelatin dry plate, introduced in the 1870s, eventually replaced it. There are three subsets to the collodion process; the [[Ambrotype]] (a positive image on glass), the [[Ferrotype]] or Tintype (a positive image on metal) and the glass negative, which was used to make positive prints on [[albumen]] or salted paper.\n\nMany advances in [[Photographic plate|photographic glass plates]] and printing were made during the rest of the 19th century. In 1891, [[Gabriel Lippmann]] introduced a process for making natural-color photographs based on the optical phenomenon of the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of light waves. His scientifically elegant and important but ultimately impractical invention earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908.\n\nGlass plates were the medium for most original camera photography from the late 1850s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the 1890s. Although the convenience of the film greatly popularized amateur photography, early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their glass plate equivalents, and until the late 1910s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers, so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old. Because of the superior dimensional stability of glass, the use of plates for some scientific applications, such as [[astrophotography]], continued into the 1990s, and in the niche field of laser [[holography]], it has persisted into the 2010s.\n\n=== Film ===\n{{Main|Photographic film}}\n[[File:undeveloped film.png|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Undeveloped Arista black-and-white film, [[Film speed|ISO]] 125/22\u00b0]]\n\n[[Hurter and Driffield]] began pioneering work on the [[sensitometry|light sensitivity]] of photographic emulsions in 1876. Their work enabled the first quantitative measure of film speed to be devised.\n\nThe first flexible photographic roll film was marketed by [[Eastman Kodak|George Eastman]], founder of [[Kodak]] in 1885, but this original \"film\" was actually a coating on a paper base. As part of the processing, the image-bearing layer was stripped from the paper and transferred to a hardened gelatin support. The first transparent plastic roll film followed in 1889.<!--am leaving this date untouched, but it is a matter of some controversy--> It was made from highly flammable [[nitrocellulose]] (\"[[celluloid]]\"), now usually called \"[[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]]\".\n\nAlthough [[cellulose acetate]] or \"[[safety film]]\" had been introduced by Kodak in 1908,<ref>[http://www.kodak.com/global/en/corp/historyOfKodak/1878.jhtml History of Kodak, Milestones-chronology: 1878\u20131929] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210123011/http://www.kodak.com/global/en/corp/historyOfKodak/1878.jhtml |date=10 February 2012}}. kodak.com</ref> at first it found only a few special applications as an alternative to the hazardous nitrate film, which had the advantages of being considerably tougher, slightly more transparent, and cheaper. The changeover was not completed for [[X-ray]] films until 1933, and although safety film was always used for 16&nbsp;mm and 8&nbsp;mm home movies, nitrate film remained standard for theatrical 35&nbsp;mm motion pictures until it was finally discontinued in 1951.\n\nFilms remained the dominant form of photography until the early 21st century when advances in digital photography drew consumers to digital formats.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Peres\n| first     = Michael R.\n| title     = The Concise Focal Encyclopedia of Photography: from the first photo on paper to the digital revolution\n| date      = 2008\n| publisher = Focal Press/Elsevier\n| location  = Burlington, MA\n| isbn      = 978-0-240-80998-4\n| page      = 75\n}}</ref> Although modern photography is dominated by digital users, film continues to be used by enthusiasts and professional photographers.

Even after color film was readily available, black-and-white photography continued to dominate for decades, due to its lower cost, chemical stability, and its \"classic\" photographic look. The tones and contrast between light and dark areas define black-and-white photography.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title   = Black & White Photography\n| journal = PSA Journal\n| volume  = 77\n| issue   = 12\n| year    = 2011\n| pages   = 38\u201340\n}}</ref> It is important to note that monochromatic pictures are not necessarily composed of pure blacks, whites, and intermediate shades of gray but can involve shades of one particular [[hue]] depending on the process. The [[cyanotype]] process, for example, produces an image composed of blue tones. The [[albumen print]] process first used more than {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1847|1|1}}|-1}} years ago, produces brownish tones.\n\nMany photographers continue to produce some monochrome images, sometimes because of the established archival permanence of well-processed silver-halide-based materials. Some full-color digital images are processed using a variety of techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome. Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; sometimes when presented as black-and-white or single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective. Although color photography has long predominated, monochrome images are still produced, mostly for artistic reasons. Almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome, and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard [[RGB color model|RGB]] color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.\n\n=== Color ===\n{{Main|Color photography}}\n[[File:Tartan Ribbon.jpg|thumb|The first [[color photograph]] made by the three-color method suggested by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1855, taken in 1861 by [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]].

Early experiments in color required extremely long exposures (hours or days for camera images) and could not \"fix\" the photograph to prevent the color from quickly fading when exposed to white light.\n\nThe first permanent color photograph was taken in 1861 using the three-color-separation principle first published by Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1855.<ref name=\"King's College\">{{cite news\n| title        = 1861: James Clerk Maxwell's greatest year\n| url          = https://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2011/04Apr/JamesClerkMaxwell.aspx\n| publisher    = King's College London\n| date         = 3 January 2017\n| access-date  = 3 January 2017\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170104000418/https://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2011/04Apr/JamesClerkMaxwell.aspx\n| archive-date = 4 January 2017\n| url-status   = live\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Maxwell\">{{cite news\n| title        = From Charles Mackintosh's waterproof to Dolly the sheep: 43 innovations Scotland has given the world\n| url          = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/charles-mackintosh-chemist-waterproof-google-doodle-scotland-inventions-innovation-bicycles-a7499911.html\n| publisher    = The independent\n| date         = 2 January 2016\n| access-date  = 2 December 2017\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171002171029/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/charles-mackintosh-chemist-waterproof-google-doodle-scotland-inventions-innovation-bicycles-a7499911.html\n| archive-date = 2 October 2017\n| url-status   = live\n}}</ref> The foundation of virtually all practical color processes, Maxwell's idea was to take three separate black-and-white photographs through red, green and blue [[filter (photography)|filters]].<ref name=\"King's College\" /><ref name=\"Maxwell\" /> This provides the photographer with the three basic channels required to recreate a color image. Transparent prints of the images could be projected through similar color filters and superimposed on the projection screen, an [[additive color|additive method]] of color reproduction. A color print on paper could be produced by superimposing [[carbon print]]s of the three images made in their [[complementary color]]s, a [[subtractive color|subtractive method]] of color reproduction pioneered by [[Louis Ducos du Hauron]] in the late 1860s.\n[[File:Colonel William Willoughby Verner, Sanger Shepherd process, by Sarah Acland 1903.png|thumb|left|Color photography was possible long before [[Kodachrome]], as this 1903 portrait by [[Sarah Angelina Acland]] demonstrates, but in its earliest years, the need for special equipment, long exposures, and complicated printing processes made it extremely rare.]]\nRussian photographer [[Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii]] made extensive use of this color separation technique, employing a special camera which successively exposed the three color-filtered images on different parts of an oblong [[photographic plate|plate]]. Because his exposures were not simultaneous, unsteady subjects exhibited color \"fringes\" or, if rapidly moving through the scene, appeared as brightly colored ghosts in the resulting projected or printed images.\n\nImplementation of color photography was hindered by the limited sensitivity of early photographic materials, which were mostly sensitive to blue, only slightly sensitive to green, and virtually insensitive to red. The discovery of dye sensitization by photochemist [[Hermann W. Vogel|Hermann Vogel]] in 1873 suddenly made it possible to add sensitivity to green, yellow and even red. Improved color sensitizers and ongoing improvements in the overall sensitivity of [[Photographic emulsion|emulsions]] steadily reduced the once-prohibitive long exposure times required for color, bringing it ever closer to commercial viability.\n\n[[Autochrome]], the first commercially successful color process, was introduced by the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] in 1907. Autochrome [[photographic plate|plates]] incorporated a [[mosaic]] color filter layer made of dyed grains of [[potato starch]], which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments. After an Autochrome plate was [[reversal film|reversal processed]] to produce a positive [[reversal film|transparency]], the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and the tiny colored points blended together in the eye, synthesizing the color of the subject by the [[additive color|additive method]]. Autochrome plates were one of several varieties of additive color screen plates and films marketed between the 1890s and the 1950s.\n\n[[Kodachrome]], the first modern \"integral tripack\" (or \"monopack\") color film, was introduced by [[Kodak]] in 1935. It captured the three color components in a multi-layer [[Photographic emulsion|emulsion]]. One layer was sensitized to record the red-dominated part of the [[visible spectrum|spectrum]], another layer recorded only the green part and a third recorded only the blue. Without special [[film processing]], the result would simply be three superimposed black-and-white images, but [[complementary color|complementary]] cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images were created in those layers by adding [[color coupler]]s during a complex processing procedure.\n\n[[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa's]] similarly structured [[Agfacolor]] Neu was introduced in 1936. Unlike Kodachrome, the color couplers in Agfacolor Neu were incorporated into the emulsion layers during manufacture, which greatly simplified the processing. Currently, available color films still employ a multi-layer emulsion and the same principles, most closely resembling Agfa's product.\n\n[[Instant film|Instant color film]], used in a special camera which yielded a unique finished color print only a minute or two after the exposure, was introduced by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] in 1963.\n\nColor photography may form images as positive transparencies, which can be used in a [[slide projector]], or as color negatives intended for use in creating positive color enlargements on specially coated paper. The latter is now the most common form of film (non-digital) color photography owing to the introduction of automated photo printing equipment. After a transition period centered around 1995\u20132005, color film was relegated to a niche market by inexpensive multi-megapixel digital cameras. Film continues to be the preference of some photographers because of its distinctive \"look\".\n\n=== Digital ===\n{{Main|Digital photography}}\n{{See also|Digital camera}}\n[[File:Early digital!.jpg|thumb|201x201px|Kodak DCS 100, based on a [[Nikon F3]] body with Digital Storage Unit]]\nIn 1981, [[Sony]] unveiled the first consumer camera to use a [[charge-coupled device]] for imaging, eliminating the need for film: the [[Sony Mavica]]. While the Mavica saved images to disk, the images were displayed on television, and the camera was not fully digital.\n\nThe first digital camera to both record and save images in a digital format was the Fujix DS-1P created by Fujfilm in 1988.<ref>https://www.fujifilm.com/innovation/achievements/ds-1p/</ref> https://www.fujifilm.com/innovation/achievements/ds-1p/\n\nIn 1991, Kodak unveiled the [[DCS 100]], the first commercially available digital single lens reflex camera. Although its high cost precluded uses other than [[photojournalism]] and professional photography, commercial [[digital photography]] was born.\n\nDigital imaging uses an electronic [[image sensor]] to record the image as a set of electronic data rather than as chemical changes on film.<ref>Schewe, Jeff (2012). The Digital Negative: Raw Image Processing In Lightroom, Camera Raw, and Photoshop. Berkeley, CA: Peachpit Press, {{ISBN|0-321-83957-9}}, p. 72</ref> An important difference between digital and chemical photography is that chemical photography resists [[photo manipulation]] because it involves [[photographic film|film]] and [[photographic paper]], while digital imaging is a highly manipulative medium. This difference allows for a degree of image post-processing that is comparatively difficult in film-based photography and permits different communicative potentials and applications.\n\nDigital photography dominates the 21st century. More than 99% of photographs taken around the world are through digital cameras, increasingly through smartphones.\n\n=== Synthesis ===\nSynthesis photography is part of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) where the shooting process is modeled on real photography. The CGI, creating digital copies of real universe, requires a visual representation process of these universes. Synthesis photography is the application of [[Analog photography|analog]] and [[digital photography]] in digital space. With the characteristics of the real photography but not being constrained by the physical limits of real world, synthesis photography allows artists to move into areas beyond the grasp of real photography.<ref>{{cite conference\n| url         = http://www.zhongart.com/marcol/premier/photoA_files/synthesis%20photography%20and%20architecture.html\n| title       = Synthesis photography and architecture\n| last1       = Paux\n| first1      = Marc-Olivier\n| date        = 1 February 2011\n| conference  = [[Imagina]]\n| location    = Monaco\n| url-status  = dead\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092825/http://www.zhongart.com/marcol/premier/photoA_files/synthesis%20photography%20and%20architecture.html\n| archivedate = 2 April 2015\n| df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Techniques ==\n[[File:San Francisco brutalism.jpg|thumb|Angles such as vertical, horizontal, or as pictured here diagonal are considered important photographic techniques]]\nA large variety of photographic techniques and media are used in the process of capturing images for photography. These include the camera; stereoscopy; dualphotography; full-spectrum, ultraviolet and infrared media; light field photography; and other imaging techniques.\n\n=== Cameras ===\n{{Main|Camera}}\nThe camera is the image-forming device, and a [[photographic plate]], [[photographic film]] or a [[silicon]] electronic [[image sensor]] is the capture medium. The respective recording medium can be the plate or film itself, or a digital magnetic or electronic memory.<ref>{{cite web\n| url          = http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/glossary/\n| title        = Glossary: Digital Photography Review\n| publisher    = Dpreview.com\n| accessdate   = 24 June 2013\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130118033153/http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?%2Fglossary%2F\n| archive-date = 18 January 2013\n| url-status   = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nPhotographers control the camera and lens to \"expose\" the light recording material to the required amount of light to form a \"[[latent image]]\" (on plate or film) or [[RAW file]] (in digital cameras) which, after appropriate processing, is converted to a usable image. [[Digital photography|Digital cameras]] use an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive electronics such as [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) or [[complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (CMOS) technology. The resulting digital image is stored electronically, but can be reproduced on a paper.\n\nThe camera (or '[[camera obscura]]') is a dark room or chamber from which, as far as possible, all light is excluded except the light that forms the image. It was discovered and used in the 16th century by painters. The subject being photographed, however, must be illuminated. Cameras can range from small to very large, a whole room that is kept dark while the object to be photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated. This was common for reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were used (see [[Process camera]]).\n\nAs soon as photographic materials became \"fast\" (sensitive) enough for taking [[Candid photography|candid]] or surreptitious pictures, small \"detective\" cameras were made, some actually disguised as a book or handbag or pocket watch (the ''Ticka'' camera) or even worn hidden behind an [[Ascot tie|Ascot]] necktie with a tie pin that was really the lens.\n\nThe [[movie camera]] is a type of photographic camera which takes a rapid sequence of photographs on recording medium. In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot at a time, the movie camera takes a series of images, each called a \"frame\". This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism. The frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific speed, called the \"frame rate\" (number of frames per second). While viewing, a person's eyes and brain merge the separate pictures to create the illusion of motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n| url         = http://www.uca.edu/org/ccsmi/ccsmi/classicwork/Myth%20Revisited.htm\n| author1     = Anderson, Joseph\n| author2     = Anderson, Barbara\n| title       = The Myth of Persistence of Vision Revisited\n| journal     = Journal of Film and Video\n| volume      = 45\n| issue       = 1\n| date        = Spring 1993\n| pages       = 3\u201312\n| url-status  = dead\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091124182503/http://www.uca.edu/org/ccsmi/ccsmi/classicwork/Myth%20Revisited.htm\n| archivedate = 24 November 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereoscopic ===\n{{Main|Stereoscopy}}\nPhotographs, both monochrome and color, can be captured and displayed through two side-by-side images that emulate human stereoscopic vision.

The dualphoto apparatus can be used to simultaneously capture both the subject and the photographer, or both sides of a geographical place at once, thus adding a supplementary narrative layer to that of a single image.<ref>{{cite news\n| title        = An introduction to Dualphotography\n| first        = Tristan\n| last         = Zand\n| url          = https://medium.com/dualphoto/an-introduction-to-dualphotography-b17f02049bbf\n| publisher    = Medium.com\n| work         = Dual.Photo\n| date         = 8 April 2017\n| access-date  = 15 April 2017\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170416044530/https://medium.com/dualphoto/an-introduction-to-dualphotography-b17f02049bbf\n| archive-date = 16 April 2017\n| url-status   = live\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Full-spectrum, ultraviolet and infrared ===\n{{Main|Full spectrum photography}}\n[[File:Saturn's Rings in Ultraviolet Light.png|thumb|This image of the [[rings of Saturn]] is an example of the application of [[ultraviolet photography]] in [[ultraviolet astronomy|astronomy]]]]\n\n[[Ultraviolet photography|Ultraviolet]] and [[infrared photography|infrared]] films have been available for many decades and employed in a variety of photographic avenues since the 1960s. New technological trends in digital photography have opened a new direction in [[full spectrum photography]], where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet, visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions.\n\nModified digital cameras can detect some ultraviolet, all of the visible and much of the near infrared spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350&nbsp;nm to 1000&nbsp;nm. An off-the-shelf digital camera contains an infrared [[hot mirror]] filter that blocks most of the infrared and a bit of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400&nbsp;nm to 700&nbsp;nm.<ref>Twede, David.

Without the hot-mirror, the red, green and blue (or cyan, yellow and magenta) colored micro-filters placed over the sensor elements pass varying amounts of ultraviolet (blue window) and infrared (primarily red and somewhat lesser the green and blue micro-filters).\n\nUses of full spectrum photography are for [[fine art photography]], [[Remote sensing#Geodetic|geology]], [[History of forensic photography|forensics]] and law enforcement.\n\n=== Light field ===\n{{See also|Light-field camera}}\nDigital methods of image capture and display processing have enabled the new technology of \"light field photography\" (also known as synthetic aperture photography). This process allows focusing at various depths of field to be selected ''after'' the photograph has been captured.<ref>[[Ren Ng|Ng, Ren]] (July 2006) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120916121457/http://www.lytro.com/renng-thesis.pdf Digital Light Field Photography]. PhD Thesis, Stanford University</ref> As explained by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1846, the \"[[light field]]\" is understood as 5-dimensional, with each point in 3-D space having attributes of two more angles that define the direction of each ray passing through that point.\n\nThese additional vector attributes can be captured optically through the use of microlenses at each pixel point within the 2-dimensional image sensor. Every pixel of the final image is actually a selection from each sub-array located under each microlens, as identified by a post-image capture focus algorithm.\n\n[[File:M\u00fc\u00fcrlooga (Arabidopsis thaliana) lehekarv (trihhoom) 311 0804.JPG|thumb|Devices other than cameras can be used to record images.

For instance, a [[photocopy]] or [[xerography]] machine forms permanent images but uses the transfer of static [[Electric charge|electrical charges]] rather than photographic medium, hence the term [[electrophotography]]. [[Photogram]]s are images produced by the shadows of objects cast on the photographic paper, without the use of a camera. Objects can also be placed directly on the glass of an [[image scanner]] to produce digital pictures.\n\n== Types of photography ==\n===Amateur=== <!-- \"Amateur photography\" redirects here. -->\nAn amateur photographer is one who practices photography as a [[hobby]]/[[Passion (emotion)|passion]] and not necessarily for profit. The quality of some amateur work is comparable to that of many professionals and may be highly specialized or [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] in choice of subjects. Amateur photography is often pre-eminent in photographic subjects which have little prospect of commercial use or reward. Amateur photography grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the hand-held camera.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi     = 10.1080/03087298.2011.606727\n| title   = Home Portraiture\n| journal = History of Photography\n| volume  = 35\n| issue   = 4\n| pages   = 374\u201387\n| year    = 2011\n| last1   = Peterson\n| first1  = C.A.\n}}</ref> Nowadays it has spread widely through social media and is carried out throughout different platforms and equipment, switching to the use of cell phone.

In this light, money could be paid for the subject of the photograph or the photograph itself. Wholesale, retail, and professional uses of photography would fall under this definition. The commercial photographic world could include:\n* Advertising photography: photographs made to illustrate and usually sell a service or product. These images, such as [[packshot]]s, are generally done with an [[advertising agency]], [[design firm]] or with an in-house corporate design team.\n* Fashion and glamour photography usually incorporates [[photographic model|models]] and is a form of advertising photography. [[Fashion photography]], like the work featured in ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', emphasizes clothes and other products; glamour emphasizes the model and body form. Glamour photography is popular in advertising and [[men's magazine]]s. Models in [[glamour photography]] sometimes work [[Nude photography|nude]].\n* [[360 product photography]] displays a series of photos to give the impression of a rotating object. This technique is commonly used by ecommerce websites to help shoppers visualise products.\n* [[Concert photography]] focuses on capturing candid images of both the artist or band as well as the atmosphere (including the crowd). Many of these photographers work freelance and are contracted through an artist or their management to cover a specific show. Concert photographs are often used to promote the artist or band in addition to the venue.\n* [[Crime scene photography]] consists of photographing scenes of crime such as robberies and murders. A black and white camera or an [[infrared camera]] may be used to capture specific details.\n* [[Still life photography]] usually depicts inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects which may be either natural or man-made. Still life is a broader category for food and some natural photography and can be used for advertising purposes.\n* Real Estate photography focuses on the production of photographs showcasing a property that is for sale, such photographs requires the use of wide-lens and extensive knowledge in [[High-dynamic-range imaging]] photography.\n[[File:Cheese and Tomatoes.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a studio-made food photograph.]]\n* [[Food photography]] can be used for editorial, packaging or advertising use. Food photography is similar to still life photography but requires some special skills.\n* [[Photojournalism]] can be considered a subset of editorial photography. Photographs made in this context are accepted as a documentation of a news story.\n* [[Paparazzi]] is a form of photojournalism in which the photographer captures candid images of athletes, celebrities, politicians, and other prominent people.\n* [[Portrait photography|Portrait]] and [[wedding photography]]: photographs made and sold directly to the end user of the images.\n* [[Landscape photography]] depicts locations.\n* [[Wildlife photography]] demonstrates the life of animals.\n\n=== Art ===\n[[File:Alfred Stieglitz - The Steerage - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Classic [[Alfred Stieglitz]] photograph, ''[[The Steerage]]'' shows unique aesthetic of black-and-white photos.]]\n\nDuring the 20th century, both [[fine art photography]] and [[documentary photography]] became accepted by the [[English language|English-speaking]] art world and the [[art gallery|gallery]] system. In the United States, a handful of photographers, including [[Alfred Stieglitz]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[John Szarkowski]], [[F. Holland Day]], and [[Edward Weston]], spent their lives advocating for photography as a fine art.\nAt first, fine art photographers tried to imitate painting styles. This movement is called [[Pictorialism]], often using [[soft focus]] for a dreamy, 'romantic' look. In reaction to that, Weston, [[Ansel Adams]], and others formed the [[Group f/64]] to advocate '[[straight photography]]', the photograph as a (sharply focused) thing in itself and not an imitation of something else.\n\nThe [[aesthetics]] of photography is a matter that continues to be discussed regularly, especially in artistic circles. Many artists argued that photography was the mechanical reproduction of an image. If photography is authentically art, then photography in the context of art would need redefinition, such as determining what component of a photograph makes it [[beauty|beautiful]] to the viewer. The controversy began with the earliest images \"written with light\"; [[Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]], [[Louis Daguerre]], and others among the very earliest photographers were met with acclaim, but some questioned if their work met the definitions and purposes of art.\n\n[[Clive Bell]] in his classic essay ''Art'' states that only \"significant form\" can distinguish art from what is not art.\n\n{{quote|There must be some one quality without which a work of art cannot exist; possessing which, in the least degree, no work is altogether worthless. What is this quality? What quality is shared by all objects that provoke our aesthetic emotions? What quality is common to Sta.

Even though what is depicted in the photographs are real objects, the subject is strictly abstract.\n\n=== Photojournalism ===\n{{Main|Photojournalism}}\nPhotojournalism is a particular form of photography (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that employs images in order to tell a news story. It is now usually understood to refer only to still images, but in some cases the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (e.g., documentary photography, social documentary photography, [[street photography]] or [[celebrity photography]]) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media, and help communities connect with one other. Photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door. They deliver news in a creative format that is not only informative, but also entertaining.\n\n=== Science and forensics ===\n[[File:Wootton bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Wootton bridge collapse]] in 1861]]\n\nThe camera has a long and distinguished history as a means of recording scientific phenomena from the first use by Daguerre and Fox-Talbot, such as astronomical events ([[Solar eclipse#Photography|eclipses]] for example), small creatures and plants when the camera was attached to the eyepiece of microscopes (in [[Micrograph|photomicroscopy]]) and for [[macro photography]] of larger specimens. The camera also proved useful in recording [[crime scene]]s and the scenes of accidents, such as the [[Wootton bridge collapse]] in 1861. The methods used in analysing photographs for use in legal cases are collectively known as [[forensic photography]]. Crime scene photos are taken from three vantage point. The vantage points are overview, mid-range, and close-up.<ref>Rohde, R.R. (2000). Crime Photography.

Different machines produced 12- or 24- hour photographic traces of the minute-by-minute variations of [[atmospheric pressure]], temperature, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric electricity]], and the three components of [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic forces]].  The cameras were supplied to numerous observatories around the world and some remained in use until well into the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book\n| title     = Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph\n| last      = Ronalds\n| first     = B.F.\n| publisher = Imperial College Press\n| year      = 2016\n| isbn      = 978-1-78326-917-4\n| location  = London\n| pages     =\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n| last         = Ronalds\n| first        = B.F.\n| year         = 2016\n| title        = The Beginnings of Continuous Scientific Recording using Photography: Sir Francis Ronalds' Contribution\n| url          = http://www.eshph.org/blog/2016/04/19/1642/\n| journal      = European Society for the History of Photography\n| access-date  = 2 June 2016\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160613031339/http://www.eshph.org/blog/2016/04/19/1642/\n| archive-date = 13 June 2016\n| url-status   = live\n}}</ref> [[Charles Brooke (surgeon)|Charles Brooke]] a little later developed similar instruments for the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Greenwich Observatory]].<ref>{{cite journal\n| journal      = The Illustrated Magazine of Art\n| title        = Photographic self-registering magnetic and meteorological apparatus: Invented by Mr. Brooke of Keppel-Street, London\n| volume       = 1\n| issue        = 5\n| pages        = 308\u201311\n| year         = 1853\n| url          = https://books.google.com/books?id=DhfnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA309\n| doi          = 10.2307/20537989\n| jstor        = 20537989\n| last1        = Brooke\n| access-date  = 13 December 2015\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160429055213/https://books.google.com/books?id=DhfnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA309\n| archive-date = 29 April 2016\n| url-status   = live\n}}</ref>\n\nScience uses image technology that has derived from the design of the Pin Hole camera.

In her ''[[On Photography]]'' (1977), [[Susan Sontag]] dismisses the objectivity of photography. This is a highly debated subject within the photographic community.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last    = Bissell\n| first   = K.L.\n| date    = 2000\n| title   = A Return to 'Mr. Gates': Photography and Objectivity\n| journal = Newspaper Research Journal\n| doi     = 10.1177/073953290002100307\n| volume  = 21\n| issue   = 3\n| pages   = 81\u201393\n}}</ref> Sontag argues, \"To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting one's self into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge, and therefore like power.\"<ref name=\"Sontag\">Sontag, S. (1977) ''[[On Photography]]'', Penguin, London, pp. 3\u201324, {{ISBN|0-312-42009-9}}.</ref> Photographers decide what to take a photo of, what elements to exclude and what angle to frame the photo, and these factors may reflect a particular socio-historical context. Along these lines, it can be argued that photography is a subjective form of representation.\n\nModern photography has raised a number of concerns on its effect on society. In [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), the camera is presented as promoting voyeurism. 'Although the camera is an observation station, the act of photographing is more than passive observing'.<ref name=\"Sontag\" />\n\n<blockquote>\nThe camera doesn't rape or even possess, though it may presume, intrude, trespass, distort, exploit, and, at the farthest reach of metaphor, assassinate \u2013 all activities that, unlike the sexual push and shove, can be conducted from a distance, and with some detachment.<ref name=\"Sontag\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nDigital imaging has raised ethical concerns because of the ease of manipulating digital photographs in post-processing. Many photojournalists have declared they will not [[cropping|crop]] their pictures or are forbidden from combining elements of multiple photos to make \"[[photomontage]]s\", passing them as \"real\" photographs. Today's technology has made [[image editing]] relatively simple for even the novice photographer. However, recent changes of in-camera processing allow digital fingerprinting of photos to detect tampering for purposes of [[forensic photography]].\n\nPhotography is one of the new media forms that changes perception and changes the structure of society.<ref>Levinson, P. (1997) ''The Soft Edge: a Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution'', Routledge, London and New York, pp. 37\u201348, {{ISBN|0-415-15785-4}}.</ref> Further unease has been caused around cameras in regards to desensitization. Fears that disturbing or explicit images are widely accessible to children and society at large have been raised. Particularly, photos of war and pornography are causing a stir. Sontag is concerned that \"to photograph is to turn people into objects that can be symbolically possessed.\" Desensitization discussion goes hand in hand with debates about censored images. Sontag writes of her concern that the ability to censor pictures means the photographer has the ability to construct reality.<ref name=\"Sontag\" />\n\nOne of the practices through which photography constitutes society is tourism.

Graphic Design is the art or profession of using design elements (such as typography and images) to convey information or create an effect. The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term \"graphic [[design]]\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]], and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common applications of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]], and [[signage]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of graphic design}}\nThe term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.<ref>Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009</ref> However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" <ref name=\":0\"/> The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the [[Nile]], on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\", from 500 <small>AD</small> to 1450 <small>AD</small>, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"<ref>Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983</ref>\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. \"<ref name=\":1\">Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[https://99designs.com.au/blog/design-history-movements/history-graphic-design/ \"Graphic design is so much a part of our modern world that it is hard to imagine living without it.

As printing and book production developed in the 15th century, advances in graphic design developed alongside it over subsequent centuries, with compositors or typesetters often designing pages as they set the type.]\n\n[https://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-design In the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct profession in the West, in part because of the job specialization process that occurred there, and in part because of the new technologies and commercial possibilities brought about by the Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation of the design of a communication medium (e.g., a poster) from its actual production. Increasingly, over the course of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and magazines hired art directors who organized all visual elements of the communication and brought them into a harmonious whole, creating an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922 typographer William A. Dwiggins coined the term ''graphic design'' to identify the emerging field.\"] [Encyclopedia Britannica 2020]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-design|title=Graphic design - Neoclassical graphic design|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===The advent of printing===\n{{Main article|History of printing}}\nDuring the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279).<ref>\" Printing\" The Silk Road Foundation.

These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] <nowiki/>introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''\"squis\"'' or ''\"pin up\" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the [[Roman era]] when public notices were posted stating ''\"if anybody...\"'', which in Latin is ''\"si quis\"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.\n\nIn 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''\"Weeklies\"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.<ref name=\":1\" /> The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the ''[[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.\n\n===Design industry===\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].<ref name=mccarthy>Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}</ref> \n\n===Twentieth century design===\n[[File:VC-25(040616-F-5677R-002).jpg|thumb|right|A Boeing 747 aircraft with [[livery]] designating it as [[Air Force One]].

The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |title=\u0e3fEmigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |accessdate=2012-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 }}</ref> stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning.

The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].\n\nDesign can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].\n\n==Skills==\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\n[https://www.thebalancecareers.com/graphic-design-skills-list-2062400 \"Many employing graphic design skills work in a communications and marketing role. Technically, graphic design is visual communication. The American Institute of Graphic Arts today defines the field for current and aspiring graphic designers.]\n\n[https://www.thebalancecareers.com/graphic-design-skills-list-2062400 The field formally incorporates creative and function understanding of seven elements into its own form of communication: space, texture, color, line, size, form, and shape.]\n\n[https://www.thebalancecareers.com/graphic-design-skills-list-2062400 While many in graphic design do complete a college degree, it is not required.

Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.<ref>Butterick, Matthew. \"Butterick's Practical Typography.\" Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Page layout===\n{{Main article|Page layout}}\n[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].\n\n===Printmaking===\n{{Main article|Printmaking}}\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\n=== Strategy ===\n[[Strategy]] is becoming more and more essential to effective graphic design. The main distinction between graphic design and [[art]] is that graphic design solves a problem as well as being aesthetically pleasing. This balance is where strategy comes in. It is important for a graphic designer to understand their clients' needs, as well as the needs of the people who will be interacting with the design. It is the designer's job to combine business and creative objectives to elevate the design beyond purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] means.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howdesign.com/how-magazine/how-march-2013/understanding-design-strategy/|title=Understanding Design Strategy: Effective Graphic Design for Clients|last=Stone|first=Terry Lee|date=2013-02-22|website=HOW Design|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"[[pen]]\". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].<ref>Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19</ref> Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws & Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011</ref>\n\n===Computers and software===\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.<ref>[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007</ref> Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].<ref>Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction</ref> While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design, these include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting), [[Corel Graphic Suite]] (for design) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).\n\n==Related design fields==\n===Interface design===\n{{Main article|User interface design}}\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].\n\n===User experience design===\n{{Main article|User experience design}}\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\n===Experiential graphic design===\n{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\n==Occupations==\n{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]\" or \"[[Graphic Artist]]\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\n===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===\n{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}\nJeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term \"[[crowdsourcing]]\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing \u2013 and Why You\u2019re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, Startups, Small businesses & Entrepreneurs have all benefitted a lot from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies who operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Visual arts}}\n\n===Related areas===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Concept art]]\n* [[Copywriting]]\n* [[Digital illustration]]\n* [[Illustration]]\n* [[Information technology]]\n* [[Instructional design]]\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[Marketing communications]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Technical illustration]]\n* [[Technical writing]]\n* [[User Experience Design]]\n* [[User Interface Design]]\n* [[Visual communication]]\n* [[Communication design]]\n* [[Visual culture]]\n}}\n\n===Related topics===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Aesthetics]]\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Design principles and elements]]\n* [[European Design Award]]\n* [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|\"First Things First 2000\"]]\n* [[Infographic]]\n* [[:Category:Graphic design schools|List of graphic design institutions]]\n* [[List of graphic designers|List of notable graphic designers]]\n* [[Logotype]]\n* [[Material culture]]\n* [[Style guide]]\n* [[Value (colorimetry)|Value]]\n* [[Visualization (computer graphics)]]\n* [[International Typographic Style]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Fiell, Charlotte and Fiell, Peter (editors).

The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term \"graphic [[design]]\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]], and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common applications of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]], and [[signage]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of graphic design}}\nThe term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.<ref>Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009</ref> However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" <ref name=\":0\"/> The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the [[Nile]], on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\", from 500 <small>AD</small> to 1450 <small>AD</small>, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"<ref>Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983</ref>\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. \"<ref name=\":1\">Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===The advent of printing===\n{{Main article|History of printing}}\nDuring the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279).<ref>\" Printing\" The Silk Road Foundation. Retrieved May 31, 2008. [http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml Silk-road.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509141910/http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml |date=2008-05-09 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] <nowiki/>introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''\"squis\"'' or ''\"pin up\" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the [[Roman era]] when public notices were posted stating ''\"if anybody...\"'', which in Latin is ''\"si quis\"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.\n\nIn 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''\"Weeklies\"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.<ref name=\":1\" /> The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the ''[[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.\n\n===Design industry===\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].<ref name=mccarthy>Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}</ref>\n\n===Twentieth century design===\n[[File:VC-25(040616-F-5677R-002).jpg|thumb|right|A Boeing 747 aircraft with [[livery]] designating it as [[Air Force One]].

The first Underground station signs were introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the name of the station. The station name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 when Pick used the expertise of [[Edward Johnston]] to design a new typeface for the Underground. Johnston redesigned the Underground sign and logo to include his typeface on the blue bar in the center of a red circle.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Meggs|first=Philip|title=A History of Graphic Design|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=1998|isbn=0-471-29198-6|location=New York|pages=229-230}}</ref><!-- Why is this a classic design example?\nWho is Edward Johnston?

The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |title=\u0e3fEmigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |accessdate=2012-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 }}</ref> stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning.

The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].\n\nDesign can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].\n\n==Skills==\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\n===Typography===\n{{Main article|Typography}}\n\nTypography includes type design, modifying type [[glyphs]] and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.<ref>Butterick, Matthew. \"Butterick's Practical Typography.\" Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Page layout===\n{{Main article|Page layout}}\n[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].\n\n===Printmaking===\n{{Main article|Printmaking}}\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\n=== Strategy ===\n[[Strategy]] is becoming more and more essential to effective graphic design. The main distinction between graphic design and [[art]] is that graphic design solves a problem as well as being aesthetically pleasing. This balance is where strategy comes in. It is important for a graphic designer to understand their clients' needs, as well as the needs of the people who will be interacting with the design. It is the designer's job to combine business and creative objectives to elevate the design beyond purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] means.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howdesign.com/how-magazine/how-march-2013/understanding-design-strategy/|title=Understanding Design Strategy: Effective Graphic Design for Clients|last=Stone|first=Terry Lee|date=2013-02-22|website=HOW Design|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"[[pen]]\". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].<ref>Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19</ref> Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws & Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011</ref>\n\n===Computers and software===\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.<ref>[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007</ref> Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].<ref>Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction</ref> While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design, these include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting), [[Corel Graphic Suite]] (for design) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).\n\n==Related design fields==\n===Interface design===\n{{Main article|User interface design}}\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].\n\n===User experience design===\n{{Main article|User experience design}}\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\n===Experiential graphic design===\n{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\n==Occupations==\n{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]\" or \"[[Graphic Artist]]\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\n===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===\n{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}\nJeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term \"[[crowdsourcing]]\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing \u2013 and Why You\u2019re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, Startups, Small businesses & Entrepreneurs have all benefitted a lot from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies who operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Visual arts}}\n\n===Related areas===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Concept art]]\n* [[Copywriting]]\n* [[Digital illustration]]\n* [[Illustration]]\n* [[Information technology]]\n* [[Instructional design]]\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[Marketing communications]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Technical illustration]]\n* [[Technical writing]]\n* [[User Experience Design]]\n* [[User Interface Design]]\n* [[Visual communication]]\n* [[Communication design]]\n* [[Visual culture]]\n}}\n\n===Related topics===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Aesthetics]]\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Design principles and elements]]\n* [[European Design Award]]\n* [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|\"First Things First 2000\"]]\n* [[Infographic]]\n* [[:Category:Graphic design schools|List of graphic design institutions]]\n* [[List of graphic designers|List of notable graphic designers]]\n* [[Logotype]]\n* [[Material culture]]\n* [[Style guide]]\n* [[Value (colorimetry)|Value]]\n* [[Visualization (computer graphics)]]\n* [[International Typographic Style]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Fiell, Charlotte and Fiell, Peter (editors).

{"title_page": "Minigame", "text_new": "{{short description|Short video game often contained within another video game}}\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2018}}\nA '''minigame''' (also spelled '''mini-game''' or '''mini game''', sometimes called a '''subgame''' or '''microgame''') is a short [[video game]] often contained within another video game, and sometimes in application software or on a display of any form of hardware. A minigame contains different [[gameplay]] elements than the main game, may be optional, and is often smaller or more simplistic than the game in which it is contained. Minigames are sometimes also offered separately for free to promote the main game. Some minigames can also be [[bonus stage]]s or [[secret level]]s.\n\n== Features ==\nMinigames occur variously as [[gameplay]] features, or as time fillers while levels are loading, or as [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] even in non video games e.g. a DOOM-like game or a flight simulator in different versions of [[Microsoft Excel]]. In the latter case, they are often called \"''secret games''\". In the former case, the successful completion of such minigames may or may not be required to finish the encompassing game. They are often included as extra content to use once the main storyline is completed. Minigames occur also on other forms of hardware e.g. on a [[dot-matrix display]] of a [[pinball]] machine or even as time filler on a traffic light e.g. StreetPong.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://streetpong.info/|title=Streetpong|website=streetpong.info|access-date=2018-04-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Minigame compilations ===\nSome games, such as the [[Wario (series)#WarioWare|''WarioWare'' series]] (which are called microgames in the game), [[UPL Co., Ltd|Universal Research Laboratories]]'s ''[[Sports game#Beginnings of sports games|Video Action]]'', some [[Cinemaware]] titles like ''[[Defender of the Crown]]'', [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker's]] ''[[Lazy Jones]]'' or the smartphone satire ''[[Phone Story]]'' are made up of many minigames strung together into one video game. Some similar games, such as [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, are considered [[party game]]s, specifically developed for [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]. In party games, minigames usually involve performing an activity faster or collecting more of a specified item than other players to win.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notable examples ==\n''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' games have many minigames in each game, often having prizes such as Pieces of Heart (increasing Link's health), Rupees (the games' currency), and upgrades ([[quiver]], [[wallet]], etc.)\n\nThe ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series is notable for featuring minigames in every entry of the series, ever since the first ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' (1987), in which a [[sliding puzzle]] in the form of an Easter egg can be unlocked while boarding the ship. Considered to be the first [[Role-playing video game|RPG]] minigame, it was added into the game by programmer [[Nasir Gebelli]] despite it not being part of [[Squaresoft]]'s original game design.<ref>{{cite news |title=\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u300eFINAL FANTASY I\u30fbII ADVANCE\u300f |url=http://dengekionline.com/soft/recommend/ff-gba/index.html |work=[[Dengeki]] |date=2004 |language=ja}}</ref> In ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' (1988), a [[rummy|matching game]] can be unlocked while boarding the ice sled and meeting a certain requirement. Later in the series, ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' (1997) was the first video game to include within it at least thirty minigames, which remains the largest number of minigames for a [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]]. The [[PC game]] ''[[Chronomaster]]'' featured similar puzzle minigames which were crucial to the plot.\n\nThe early ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' games on the Sega Genesis had minigame bonus/special stages, such as bouncing around a maze searching for a special gem, or collecting gold rings while running down a tube, and stray from standard gameplay. ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'', for example, has a special stage in which Sonic must run around trying to touch all the blue spheres, while avoiding red ones, and interacting with other spheres, who have special properties. This bonus stage actually became its own game. By inserting the original Sonic 1 (or [[Sonic Classics|''Sonic Classics 3 in 1'']]) cartridge into the ''[[Sonic and Knuckles]]'' lock-on slot, you can then press A, B, and C, then enter any given password to play the special stage corresponding to that password, which plays exactly like those of ''Sonic 3''.\n\nLike above, some minigames become so popular that they are eventually published as individual titles by themselves. Notable examples are ''[[Geometry Wars]]'', which was originally a minigame in ''[[Project Gotham Racing 2]]'', and [[Arcomage]], a relatively complex minigame, reminiscent of ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', first introduced in ''[[Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor]]''.\n\nThe [[PocketStation]] (for [[Sony PlayStation]]) and [[VMU]] (for [[Dreamcast]]) accessories allowed the user to download minigames from the main console onto the pocket device, and often then sync progress in the minigame back on to the console. Two examples of this include the ''[[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Minigames|Chocobo World]]'' minigame inside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''<ref>[http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/068/068855p1.html FFVIII PocketStation Opens Up Chocobo World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321213256/http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/068/068855p1.html |date=2012-03-21 }}, ''IGN'', July 15, 1999</ref> (which is also playable on PC), and 'Chao Adventure', a minigame in ''[[Sonic Adventure]]''.\n\nThe tabletop game ''[[Mansions of Madness]]'' also features minigames in the form of simple puzzles.\n\n''[[Capcom]]'s'' ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series features two minigames as bonus stages in ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', ''[[Street Fighter III]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'', after winning matches.\n\n== List of minigames ==\n\n=== [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|Fifth generation]] ===\n\n==== [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] ====\n* ''[[Ape Escape (video game)|Ape Escape]]'': Galaxy Monkey (a shoot 'em up), Ski Kidz Racing & Specter Boxing.\n* ''[[Crash Bash]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Digimon World]]'': Collecting cards, as well as some minigames in shops.\n*''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'': Triple Triad (card collection and battle game)\n* ''[[Legend of Legaia]]'': Baka Fighter, Coliseum, Fishing, Sol Fever Disco and Slot Machines.\n* ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]'': Some Virtual Reality missions can be played.\n** ''[[Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions]]'': This '''compilation''' features over 300 missions.\n* ''[[Syphon Filter 3#Minigames|Syphon Filter 3]]'': Assassinate, Eliminate, Demolition, Thief, Biathlon.\n* ''[[Suikoden]]'': Cups Game and Matching Cards.\n* ''[[Suikoden II]]'': Chinchirorin, Dancing Stage, Cooking, Fishing, Rope Climbing and Whack a Mole. \n* ''[[Tekken (video game)|Tekken]]'': ''[[Galaga]]''.\n* ''[[Tekken 3]]'': Tekken Force, Tekken Ball.\n\n==== [[Nintendo 64]] ====\n* ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'': Included a variant of the original ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' arcade game.\n* ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'': Three minigames: 100-Yard Hop, Bumper Crop Bump, Checker Board Chase.\n* ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'': Balloon Battle\n* ''[[Mario Party (video game)|Mario Party]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Mario Party 2]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Mario Party 3]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium]]'': Nine minigames through Kids Club: Clefairy Says, Dig!

A minigame contains different [[gameplay]] elements than the main game, may be optional, and is often smaller or more simplistic than the game in which it is contained. Minigames are sometimes also offered separately for free to promote the main game. Some minigames can also be [[bonus stage]]s or [[secret level]]s.\n\n== Features ==\nMinigames occur variously as [[gameplay]] features, or as time fillers while levels are loading, or as [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] even in non video games e.g. a DOOM-like game or a flight simulator in different versions of [[Microsoft Excel]]. In the latter case, they are often called \"''secret games''\". In the former case, the successful completion of such minigames may or may not be required to finish the encompassing game. They are often included as extra content to use once the main storyline is completed. Minigames occur also on other forms of hardware e.g. on a [[dot-matrix display]] of a [[pinball]] machine or even as time filler on a traffic light e.g. StreetPong.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://streetpong.info/|title=Streetpong|website=streetpong.info|access-date=2018-04-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Minigame compilations ===\nSome games, such as the [[Wario (series)#WarioWare|''WarioWare'' series]] (which are called microgames in the game), [[UPL Co., Ltd|Universal Research Laboratories]]'s ''[[Sports game#Beginnings of sports games|Video Action]]'', some [[Cinemaware]] titles like ''[[Defender of the Crown]]'', [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker's]] ''[[Lazy Jones]]'' or the smartphone satire ''[[Phone Story]]'' are made up of many minigames strung together into one video game. Some similar games, such as [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, are considered [[party game]]s, specifically developed for [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]. In party games, minigames usually involve performing an activity faster or collecting more of a specified item than other players to win.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notable examples ==\n''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' games have many minigames in each game, often having prizes such as Pieces of Heart (increasing Link's health), Rupees (the games' currency), and upgrades ([[quiver]], [[wallet]], etc.)\n\nThe ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series is notable for featuring minigames in every entry of the series, ever since the first ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' (1987), in which a [[sliding puzzle]] in the form of an Easter egg can be unlocked while boarding the ship. Considered to be the first [[Role-playing video game|RPG]] minigame, it was added into the game by programmer [[Nasir Gebelli]] despite it not being part of [[Squaresoft]]'s original game design.<ref>{{cite news |title=\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u300eFINAL FANTASY I\u30fbII ADVANCE\u300f |url=http://dengekionline.com/soft/recommend/ff-gba/index.html |work=[[Dengeki]] |date=2004 |language=ja}}</ref> In ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' (1988), a [[rummy|matching game]] can be unlocked while boarding the ice sled and meeting a certain requirement. Later in the series, ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' (1997) was the first video game to include within it at least thirty minigames, which remains the largest number of minigames for a [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]]. The [[PC game]] ''[[Chronomaster]]'' featured similar puzzle minigames which were crucial to the plot.\n\nThe early ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' games on the Sega Genesis had minigame bonus/special stages, such as bouncing around a maze searching for a special gem, or collecting gold rings while running down a tube, and stray from standard gameplay. ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'', for example, has a special stage in which Sonic must run around trying to touch all the blue spheres, while avoiding red ones, and interacting with other spheres, who have special properties. This bonus stage actually became its own game. By inserting the original Sonic 1 (or [[Sonic Classics|''Sonic Classics 3 in 1'']]) cartridge into the ''[[Sonic and Knuckles]]'' lock-on slot, you can then press A, B, and C, then enter any given password to play the special stage corresponding to that password, which plays exactly like those of ''Sonic 3''.\n\nLike above, some minigames become so popular that they are eventually published as individual titles by themselves. Notable examples are ''[[Geometry Wars]]'', which was originally a minigame in ''[[Project Gotham Racing 2]]'', and [[Arcomage]], a relatively complex minigame, reminiscent of ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', first introduced in ''[[Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor]]''.\n\nThe [[PocketStation]] (for [[Sony PlayStation]]) and [[VMU]] (for [[Dreamcast]]) accessories allowed the user to download minigames from the main console onto the pocket device, and often then sync progress in the minigame back on to the console. Two examples of this include the ''[[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Minigames|Chocobo World]]'' minigame inside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''<ref>[http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/068/068855p1.html FFVIII PocketStation Opens Up Chocobo World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321213256/http://uk.psx.ign.com/articles/068/068855p1.html |date=2012-03-21 }}, ''IGN'', July 15, 1999</ref> (which is also playable on PC), and 'Chao Adventure', a minigame in ''[[Sonic Adventure]]''.\n\nThe tabletop game ''[[Mansions of Madness]]'' also features minigames in the form of simple puzzles.\n\n''[[Capcom]]'s'' ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series features two minigames as bonus stages in ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', ''[[Street Fighter III]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'', after winning matches.\n\n== List of minigames ==\n\n=== [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|Fifth generation]] ===\n\n==== [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] ====\n* ''[[Ape Escape (video game)|Ape Escape]]'': Galaxy Monkey (a shoot 'em up), Ski Kidz Racing & Specter Boxing.\n* ''[[Crash Bash]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Digimon World]]'': Collecting cards, as well as some minigames in shops.\n*''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'': Triple Triad (card collection and battle game)\n* ''[[Legend of Legaia]]'': Baka Fighter, Coliseum, Fishing, Sol Fever Disco and Slot Machines.\n* ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]'': Some Virtual Reality missions can be played.\n** ''[[Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions]]'': This '''compilation''' features over 300 missions.\n* ''[[Syphon Filter 3#Minigames|Syphon Filter 3]]'': Assassinate, Eliminate, Demolition, Thief, Biathlon.\n* ''[[Suikoden]]'': Cups Game and Matching Cards.\n* ''[[Suikoden II]]'': Chinchirorin, Dancing Stage, Cooking, Fishing, Rope Climbing and Whack a Mole. \n* ''[[Tekken (video game)|Tekken]]'': ''[[Galaga]]''.\n* ''[[Tekken 3]]'': Tekken Force, Tekken Ball.\n\n==== [[Nintendo 64]] ====\n* ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'': Included a variant of the original ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' arcade game.\n* ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'': Three minigames: 100-Yard Hop, Bumper Crop Bump, Checker Board Chase.\n* ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'': Balloon Battle\n* ''[[Mario Party (video game)|Mario Party]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Mario Party 2]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Mario Party 3]]'': '''Compilation''' of minigames.\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium]]'': Nine minigames through Kids Club: Clefairy Says, Dig!

The event, created by Matty Roberts on June 27, 2019, would involve raiding the site in a search for [[extraterrestrial life]]. More than 2 million people responded \"going\" and 1.5 million \"interested\" on the event's page, which subsequently attracted widespread media reaction and caused the event to become an [[Internet meme]]. Roberts later stated that the event was purely comedic, and disavowed responsibility for any casualties were there any actual attempts to raid the military base.\n\nOn the day of the event, only about 150 people were reported to have shown up at the entrance to Area 51, with none succeeding in entering the site. Two [[music festival]]s were planned to coincide with the event: Alienstock in [[Rachel, Nevada]] and Storm Area 51 Basecamp in [[Hiko, Nevada]]. An estimated 1,500 people attended these festivals, according to state and local law enforcement. Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews stated government officials were briefed on the event and discouraged people from attempting to enter military property. [[Nevada]] [[law enforcement]] also warned potential participants in the event against [[Trespass to land#United States|trespassing]]. The event had an effect on businesses both locally in Nevada and around the United States, which prepared products for visitors and those attending the event.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Area 51|UFO conspiracy theory|Bob Lazar}}\n[[File:Wfm x51 area51 warningsign.jpg|thumb|[[Warning sign]] near Area 51 (2003)|alt=]]\nArea 51 has been the subject of many [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] regarding the presence of aliens on the site.

51 Raid''', was an American [[Facebook event]] that took place on September 20, 2019, at [[Area 51]], a [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) facility within the [[Nevada Test and Training Range]]. The event, created by Matty Roberts on June 27, 2019, would involve raiding the site in a search for [[extraterrestrial life]]. More than 2 million people responded \"going\" and 1.5 million \"interested\" on the event's page, which subsequently attracted widespread media reaction and caused the event to become an [[Internet meme]]. Roberts later stated that the event was purely comedic, and disavowed responsibility for any casualties were there any actual attempts to raid the military base.\n\nOn the day of the event, only about 150 people were reported to have shown up at the entrance to Area 51, with none succeeding in entering the site. Two [[music festival]]s were planned to coincide with the event: Alienstock in [[Rachel, Nevada]] and Storm Area 51 Basecamp in [[Hiko, Nevada]]. An estimated 1,500 people attended these festivals, according to state and local law enforcement. Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews stated government officials were briefed on the event and discouraged people from attempting to enter military property. [[Nevada]] [[law enforcement]] also warned potential participants in the event against [[Trespass to land#United States|trespassing]]. The event had an effect on businesses both locally in Nevada and around the United States, which prepared products for visitors and those attending the event.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Area 51|UFO conspiracy theory|Bob Lazar}}\n[[File:Wfm x51 area51 warningsign.jpg|thumb|[[Warning sign]] near Area 51 (2003)|alt=]]\nArea 51 has been the subject of many [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] regarding the presence of aliens on the site.

Its crown is speckled, dark grey on brown plumage. The juvenile bird has a characteristic yellow cheek sash, although this is less pronounced in the adult bird, where predominantly the cheek is white with a grey and/or brown streak under the cheek.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Field guide to the birds of Australia|last=Simpson|first=K.|last2=Day|first2=N.|publisher=Penguin group Australian|year=2010|isbn=|edition=8th|location=Melbourne|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Birds of Australia: Photographic field guide|last=Flagg|first=Jim|publisher=Reed New Holland|year=2002|isbn=1 876334 78 9|location=Sydney|pages=294\u2013295}}</ref>\n\nIts beak is long and straight with a black tip and a fleshy red or pink colour towards the chin and up to the [[Beak|gape]]. The characteristic face pattern includes a long, dark stripe through the eyes to the ear coverts. The breast is creamy-white with short, browny streaks. The throat is often a light brown or cinnamon, sometimes extending from the beak to the upper breast. The wing feathers are a mottled, dark olive-brown to grey with white edges. The tail has similar colouring, but the tips of the tail-feathers are white. The [[Covert feather|under-tail coverts]] are white or, on some birds, light grey, and often streaked.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere seems to be an amount of variability in the appearance of many birds in this species. One example is on the [[Mornington Peninsula]], located on the eastern coast of Port Phillip Bay in Victoria, where the spiny-cheeked honeyeaters have darker bellies. The juvenile birds of the species have a brown iris, and the facial skin is paler on the beak.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Habitat ==\n\nThe spiny-cheeked honeyeater can be found in most locations throughout Australia, except east of the Great Dividing Range, Tasmania, the far south-west of Western Australia and the northern Australian tropics.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://bie.ala.org.au/search?q=Spiny-cheeked+Honeyeater|title=Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater {{!}} Search|last=Australia|first=Atlas of Living|website=bie.ala.org.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref> However, the birds do occur on [[Kangaroo Island]] in South Australia.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Acanthagenys-rufogularis|title=Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater {{!}} BIRDS in BACKYARDS|website=www.birdsinbackyards.net|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref>\n\nMost sightings have been in sparse, woody tree environments.

Its crown is speckled dark grey on brown plumage. The juvenile bird has a characteristic yellow cheek sash, although this is less pronounced in the adult bird where predominantly the cheek is white with a grey and/or brown streak under the cheek.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Field guide to the birds of Australia|last=Simpson|first=K.|last2=Day|first2=N.|publisher=Penguin group Australian|year=2010|isbn=|edition=8th|location=Melbourne|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Birds of Australia: Photographic field guide|last=Flagg|first=Jim|publisher=Reed New Holland|year=2002|isbn=1 876334 78 9|location=Sydney|pages=294\u2013295}}</ref>\n\nIts beak is long and straight with a black tip and a fleshy red or pink colour towards the chin and up to the [[Beak|gape]]. The characteristic face pattern includes a long dark stripe through the eyes to the ear coverts. The breast is creamy-white with short browny streaks. The throat is often a light brown or cinnamon, sometimes extending from the beak to the upper breast. The wing feathers are a mottled dark olive-brown to grey with white edges. The tail has similar colouring but the tips of the tail feathers are white. The [[Covert feather|under-tail coverts]] are white or, on some birds, light grey often streaked.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere seems to be an amount of variability in the appearance of many birds in this species. One example is on the [[Mornington Peninsula]] located on the eastern coast of Port Phillip Bay in Victoria where the birds have darker bellies. The juvenile birds of the species have a brown iris and the facial skin is paler on the beak.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Habitat ==\n\nThe spiny-cheeked honeyeater can be found in most locations throughout Australia, except east of the Great Dividing Range, Tasmania, the far south-west of Western Australia and the northern Australian tropics.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://bie.ala.org.au/search?q=Spiny-cheeked+Honeyeater|title=Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater {{!}} Search|last=Australia|first=Atlas of Living|website=bie.ala.org.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref> However, the birds do occur on [[Kangaroo Island]] in South Australia.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Acanthagenys-rufogularis|title=Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater {{!}} BIRDS in BACKYARDS|website=www.birdsinbackyards.net|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref>\n\nMost sightings have been in sparse, woody tree environments.
