Fast train connections to central London have resulted in the town becoming a primarily residential suburb. In 1946, the Admiralty started to build highly secret high-performance electronic digital computers at Borehamwood in a redundant wartime factory, firstly for the purpose of real-time gunnery control, and later for surface-to-air guided weapons and missiles, and for specialist cryptography and code-breaking computers for [[GCHQ]].<ref>Simon Lavington ed. 2012 ''Alan Turing and his contemporaries: Building the World's First Computers'' BCS</ref>\n\nBorehamwood is currently{{when|date=April 2016}} undergoing a substantial housing transformation which has seen hundreds of new homes built over the last five years. There are currently two further developments being built and more are expected.\n\nIn addition to the studios, the town is also home to many retail shops, hotels, restaurants, offices and light industry. The hotels cater mainly to tourists visiting the Elstree Studios, attendees of the television shows being recorded in the Elstree Studios and London visitors due to the proximity to London and the considerable lower accommodation rates.\n\nThere is one weekly newspaper, the ''Borehamwood and Elstree Times''.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Elstree Station - geograph.org.uk - 1065966.jpg|thumb|Elstree & Borehamwood Station]]\n[[File:London Buses route 292 Elstree station.jpg|thumb|London Buses route 292]]\nOn the west side of Borehamwood is [[Elstree & Borehamwood railway station]] (TfL Zone 6) served by trains operated by [[Govia Thameslink Railway]] on the [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink route]].\n\n[[Metroline]] for [[London buses]] runs its number [[London Buses route 107|107]] service through the town from [[New Barnet]] to [[Edgware]] and back, whilst [[London Sovereign]] for [[London buses]] operates the number [[London Buses route 292|292]] bus service going into north-west London.

This earned it the nickname of the \"British [[Hollywood]]\". Whilst most of these studios have now closed, two still remain.\n\nMany well-known films including  ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1955), Star Wars (1977-), ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), ''[[Summer Holiday (1963 film)|Summer Holiday]]'' (1963), ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Dr Zhivago]]'' (1965)', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) and, ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980) starring Jack Nicholson, some of the ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' films were filmed at the former [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Associated British Studios in Shenley Road]]. These were partly demolished in the 1980s to make way for a [[Tesco Extra]] supermarket on one side and an office block complex on the other.\n\nThe area between the supermarket and the office blocks is all that remains of the original studio, which has been much reduced in size and usefulness to production companies as a result. [[Elstree Studios]] were more recently used for the popular TV series ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'', as well as several major feature films. The ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'' TV series' production offices were based in the studios and, although the series was supposedly set in [[Oxford]], several exterior locations (banks, shops etc.) were filmed in the streets of Borehamwood.\n\nThe former [[British National Studios]] off Clarendon Road, referred to locally as \"The Douglas Fairbanks studios\" (which were bought by [[Lew Grade]]'s [[Associated Television Network|ATV]] in 1962), are now the BBC Elstree Studios. The studios have, over the years, been home to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', [[Gerry Anderson]]'s TV series ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'', [[Jim Henson]]'s TV series ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' was also produced there, and now BBC's popular soap, ''[[EastEnders]]'' and their medical drama ''[[Holby City]]''. An episode of ''[[Judge John Deed]]'' included scenes of the [[Tesco Extra]], but with Borehamwood crossed out and [[Lewes]] written in its place.\n\nSeveral other studios including The Gate Studio and the Danziger Studios at nearby Elstree have been demolished. The [[MGM-British Studios]] complex (demolished in the early 1970s) saw the production of many well-known films such as ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' (1968) and ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969 film)|Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' (1969), as well as many ITV television series including ''[[The Prisoner]]'' (1967\u201368).\n\nThe newer [[Millennium Studios]] is situated on Elstree Way, Borehamwood.\n\n==Notable companies==\nThe UK headquarters of [[Pizza Hut]] Restaurants are based within the town, the head office of the Delivery portion having moved to nearby St Albans in 2015; and, until 2003, so were the headquarters of the United Kingdom subsidiary of [[T-Mobile]], with both being based in the office blocks standing on part of what used to be the old Elstree Studios. [[Regent Inns]] has its head office on Elstree Way. [[George Wimpey]] also has large offices within the town.

There are currently two further developments being built and more are expected.\n\nIn addition to the studios, the town is also home to many retail shops, hotels, restaurants, offices and light industry. The hotels cater mainly to tourists visiting the Elstree Studios, attendees of the television shows being recorded in the Elstree Studios and London visitors due to the proximity to London and the considerable lower accommodation rates.\n\nThere is one weekly newspaper, the ''Borehamwood and Elstree Times''.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Elstree Station - geograph.org.uk - 1065966.jpg|thumb|Elstree & Borehamwood Station]]\n[[File:London Buses route 292 Elstree station.jpg|thumb|London Buses route 292]]\nOn the west side of Borehamwood is [[Elstree & Borehamwood railway station]] (TfL Zone 6) served by trains operated by [[Govia Thameslink Railway]] on the [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink route]].\n\n[[Metroline]] for [[London buses]] runs its number [[London Buses route 107|107]] service through the town from [[New Barnet]] to [[Edgware]] and back, whilst [[London Sovereign]] for [[London buses]] operates the number [[London Buses route 292|292]] bus service going into north-west London.

This earned it the nickname of the \"British [[Hollywood]]\". Whilst most of these studios have now closed, two still remain.\n\nMany well-known films including  ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1955), Star Wars (1977-), ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), ''[[Summer Holiday (1963 film)|Summer Holiday]]'' (1963), ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Dr Zhivago]]'' (1965)', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) and, ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980) starring Jack Nicholson, some of the ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' films were filmed at the former [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Associated British Studios in Shenley Road]]. These were partly demolished in the 1980s to make way for a [[Tesco Extra]] supermarket on one side and an office block complex on the other.\n\nThe area between the supermarket and the office blocks is all that remains of the original studio, which has been much reduced in size and usefulness to production companies as a result. [[Elstree Studios]] were more recently used for the popular TV series ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'', as well as several major feature films. The ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'' TV series' production offices were based in the studios and, although the series was supposedly set in [[Oxford]], several exterior locations (banks, shops etc.) were filmed in the streets of Borehamwood.\n\nThe former [[British National Studios]] off Clarendon Road, referred to locally as \"The Douglas Fairbanks studios\" (which were bought by [[Lew Grade]]'s [[Associated Television Network|ATV]] in 1962), are now the BBC Elstree Studios. The studios have, over the years, been home to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', [[Gerry Anderson]]'s TV series ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'', [[Jim Henson]]'s TV series ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' was also produced there, and now BBC's popular soap, ''[[EastEnders]]'' and their medical drama ''[[Holby City]]''. An episode of ''[[Judge John Deed]]'' included scenes of the [[Tesco Extra]], but with Borehamwood crossed out and [[Lewes]] written in its place.\n\nSeveral other studios including The Gate Studio and the Danziger Studios at nearby Elstree have been demolished. The [[MGM-British Studios]] complex (demolished in the early 1970s) saw the production of many well-known films such as ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' (1968) and ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969 film)|Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' (1969), as well as many ITV television series including ''[[The Prisoner]]'' (1967\u201368).\n\nThe newer [[Millennium Studios]] is situated on Elstree Way, Borehamwood.\n\n==Notable companies==\nThe UK headquarters of [[Pizza Hut]] Restaurants are based within the town, the head office of the Delivery portion having moved to nearby St Albans in 2015; and, until 2003, so were the headquarters of the United Kingdom subsidiary of [[T-Mobile]], with both being based in the office blocks standing on part of what used to be the old Elstree Studios. [[Regent Inns]] has its head office on Elstree Way. [[George Wimpey]] also has large offices within the town.
