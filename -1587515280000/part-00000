It is a hydrated [[sodium]] and [[aluminium]] [[silicate]] with the formula {{sodium|2}}{{aluminum|2}}{{silicon|3}}{{oxygen|10}}{{hydrate|2}}.<ref name=IMA/>  The type locality is [[Hohentwiel]], [[Hegau]], [[Germany]].<ref name=Klapoth/>\n\nIt was named natrolite by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] in 1803.<ref name=Klapoth/> The name is derived from ''natron'' ({{lang|el|\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd}}), the Greek word for [[Natron|soda]], in reference to the sodium content, and ''lithos'' ({{lang|el|\u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2}}), meaning stone.  Needle stone or needle-zeolite are other informal names, alluding to the common [[acicular (crystal habit)|acicular]] habit of the [[crystal]]s, which are often very slender and are aggregated in divergent tufts.  The crystals are frequently epitaxial overgrowths of natrolite, [[mesolite]], and [[gonnardite]] in various orders.<ref name=Zeolites/>\n\n== Properties ==\nLarger crystals most commonly have the form of a square prism terminated by a low pyramid, the prism angle being nearly a right angle. The crystals are tetragonal in appearance, though actually orthorhombic. There are perfect cleavages parallel to the faces of the prism. The mineral also often occurs in compact fibrous aggregates, the fibers having a divergent or radial arrangement. Natrolite is readily distinguished from other fibrous zeolites by its optical characteristics.\n\nBetween crossed [[Nicol prism|nicol]]s the fibers extinguish parallel to their length, and they do not show an optic figure in convergent [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] light. Natrolite is usually white or colorless, but sometimes reddish or yellowish. The [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] is vitreous, or, in finely fibrous specimens, silky.\n\nThe [[specific gravity]] is 2.2, and the [[hardness]] is 5.5. The mineral is readily fusible, melting in a candle-flame to which it imparts a yellow color owing to the presence of sodium. It is decomposed by [[hydrochloric acid]] with separation of gelatinous [[silica]].\n\n== Environment ==\nNatrolite occurs with other zeolites in the amygdaloidal cavities of [[basalt]]ic [[igneous rock]]s.  It is also common in nepheline syenites.\n\n== Notable localities ==\nExcellent specimens of diverging groups of white prismatic crystals are found in compact [[basalt]] at the Puy-deMarman, [[Puy-de-D\u00f4me]], [[France]]. Huge crystals have been found on the Kola Peninsula, Russia (30&nbsp;cm by 13&nbsp;cm).<ref name=Zeolites/> The walls of cavities in the basalt of the [[Giants Causeway]], in [[County Antrim]], are frequently encrusted with slender needles of natrolite, and similar material is found abundantly in the volcanic rocks (basalt and [[phonolite]]) of Salesel, Aussig and several other places in the north of [[Bohemia]].  Mont St. Hilaire, [[Quebec]] has produced large crystals associated with many rare minerals.  The [[Bay of Fundy]] in [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Jersey]], [[Oregon]], and [[British Columbia]] have also produced excellent specimens.\n\nSeveral varieties of natrolite have been distinguished by special Nips. '''Fargite''' is a red natrolite from [[Glenfarg]] in Perthshire. '''Bergmannite''', or '''Spreustein''', is an impure variety which has resulted by the alteration of other minerals, chiefly [[sodalite]], in the [[augite]] [[syenite]] of southern Norway.\n\n==Images==\n<gallery widths=\"133px\" heights=\"130px\">\nFile:Zeolite-greenland hg.jpg|Natrolite from the plateau basalts in east Greenland\nFile:Natrolite-61051.jpg|Colorless, radiating natrolite in zeolite pod\nFile:Catapleiite, Natrolite-168971.jpg|Catapleiite and natrolite from Poudrette quarry, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\nFile:Natrolite-Inesite-21148.jpg|Slender needles of natrolite are accented by deep pink inesites\nFile:Natrolite-223955.jpg|Natrolite in spherical clusters inside protective pocket of volcanic rock\nFile:Natrolite-Inesite-37029.jpg|Natrolite sprays of stark white crystals are shooting out from a [[vug]] of inesite\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Natrolite}}\n*[http://helios.princeton.edu/zeomics/cgi-bin/view_structure.pl?src=iza&id=NAT Structure type NAT]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050608024808/http://mineral.galleries.com/minerals/silicate/natrolit/natrolit.htm Mineral Galleries]\n*[http://www.mindat.org/min-2947.html Mindat]\n*[http://webmineral.com/data/Natrolite.shtml Webmineral]\n\n===Attribution===\n{{EB1911|wstitle=Natrolite|volume=19|page=273}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Tectosilicates]]\n[[Category:Sodium minerals]]\n[[Category:Aluminium minerals]]\n[[Category:Zeolites]]\n[[Category:Orthorhombic minerals]]\n[[Category:Luminescent minerals]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox mineral\n| name        = Natrolite\n| boxwidth    = \n| boxbgcolor  = \n| image       = Natroliteinde1.jpg\n| imagesize   = 260px\n| alt         = \n| caption     = \n| category    = [[Tectosilicate]]\n| formula     = Na<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O\n| molweight   = 380.22 g/mol\n| strunz      = 9.GA.05 (10 ed) <br/><small>8/J.21-10 (8 ed)</small>\n| dana        = 77.01.05.01\n| system      = [[Orthorhombic]]\n| class       = Pyramidal (mm2) <br/>[[H-M symbol]]: (mm2)\n| symmetry    = ''F''dd2\n| unit cell   = a = 18.27, b = 18.587 <br/>c = 6.56&nbsp;[\u00c5], Z&nbsp;=&nbsp;8\n| color       = White, colorless, sometimes pink\n| colour      = \n| habit       = Acicular\n| twinning    = On {110}, {011}, {031}\n| cleavage    = Perfect on {110}\n| fracture    = Irregular, uneven\n| tenacity    = Brittle\n| mohs        = 5-6\n| luster      = Vitreous, Silky, Pearly\n| streak      = White\n| diaphaneity = Transparent to translucent \n| gravity     = 2.25\n| density     = \n| polish      = \n| opticalprop = \n| refractive  = \n| birefringence = \n| pleochroism = \n| 2V          = \n| dispersion  = \n| extinction  = \n| length fast/slow =\n| fluorescence = \n| absorption  = \n| melt        = \n| fusibility  = \n| diagnostic  = \n| solubility  = \n| impurities  = \n| alteration  = \n| other       = \n| prop1       = \n| prop1text   = \n| references  =<ref name=Zeolites>R.

The crystals are tetragonal in appearance, though actually orthorhombic. There are perfect cleavages parallel to the faces of the prism. The mineral also often occurs in compact fibrous aggregates, the fibers having a divergent or radial arrangement. Natrolite is readily distinguished from other fibrous zeolites by its optical characteristics.\n\nBetween crossed [[Nicol prism|nicol]]s the fibers extinguish parallel to their length, and they do not show an optic figure in convergent [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] light. Natrolite is usually white or colorless, but sometimes reddish or yellowish. The [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] is vitreous, or, in finely fibrous specimens, silky.\n\nThe [[specific gravity]] is 2.2, and the [[hardness]] is 5.5. The mineral is readily fusible, melting in a candle-flame to which it imparts a yellow color owing to the presence of sodium. It is decomposed by [[hydrochloric acid]] with separation of gelatinous [[silica]].\n\n== Environment ==\nNatrolite occurs with other zeolites in the amygdaloidal cavities of [[basalt]]ic [[igneous rock]]s.  It is also common in nepheline syenites.\n\n== Notable localities ==\nExcellent specimens of diverging groups of white prismatic crystals are found in compact [[basalt]] at the Puy-deMarman, [[Puy-de-D\u00f4me]], [[France]]. Huge crystals have been found on the Kola Peninsula, Russia (30&nbsp;cm by 13&nbsp;cm).<ref name=Zeolites/> The walls of cavities in the basalt of the [[Giants Causeway]], in [[County Antrim]], are frequently encrusted with slender needles of natrolite, and similar material is found abundantly in the volcanic rocks (basalt and [[phonolite]]) of Salesel, Aussig and several other places in the north of [[Bohemia]].  Mont St. Hilaire, [[Quebec]] has produced large crystals associated with many rare minerals.  The [[Bay of Fundy]] in [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Jersey]], [[Oregon]], and [[British Columbia]] have also produced excellent specimens.\n\nSeveral varieties of natrolite have been distinguished by special Nips. '''Fargite''' is a red natrolite from [[Glenfarg]] in Perthshire. '''Bergmannite''', or '''Spreustein''', is an impure variety which has resulted by the alteration of other minerals, chiefly [[sodalite]], in the [[augite]] [[syenite]] of southern Norway.\n\n==Images==\n<gallery widths=\"133px\" heights=\"130px\">\nFile:Zeolite-greenland hg.jpg|Natrolite from the plateau basalts in east Greenland\nFile:Natrolite-61051.jpg|Colorless, radiating natrolite in zeolite pod\nFile:Catapleiite, Natrolite-168971.jpg|Catapleiite and natrolite from Poudrette quarry, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada\nFile:Natrolite-Inesite-21148.jpg|Slender needles of natrolite are accented by deep pink inesites\nFile:Natrolite-223955.jpg|Natrolite in spherical clusters inside protective pocket of volcanic rock\nFile:Natrolite-Inesite-37029.jpg|Natrolite sprays of stark white crystals are shooting out from a [[vug]] of inesite\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Natrolite}}\n*[http://helios.princeton.edu/zeomics/cgi-bin/view_structure.pl?src=iza&id=NAT Structure type NAT]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050608024808/http://mineral.galleries.com/minerals/silicate/natrolit/natrolit.htm Mineral Galleries]\n*[http://www.mindat.org/min-2947.html Mindat]\n*[http://webmineral.com/data/Natrolite.shtml Webmineral]\n\n===Attribution===\n{{EB1911|wstitle=Natrolite|volume=19|page=273}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Tectosilicates]]\n[[Category:Sodium minerals]]\n[[Category:Aluminium minerals]]\n[[Category:Zeolites]]\n[[Category:Orthorhombic minerals]]\n[[Category:Luminescent minerals]]\n", "name_user": "Pufferfyshe", "label": "safe", "comment": "geographical links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natrolite"}
