Kirk's use of the word \"prejudice\" here is not intended to carry its contemporary pejorative connotation: a conservative himself, he believed that the inherited wisdom of the ages may be a better guide than apparently rational individual judgment.\n\nThere are two overlapping subgroups of social conservatives\u2014the traditional and the religious. Traditional conservatives strongly support traditional codes of conduct, especially those they feel are threatened by social change and modernization. For example, traditional conservatives may oppose the use of female soldiers in combat. Religious conservatives focus on conducting society as prescribed by a religious authority or code. In the United States, this translates into hard-line stances on moral issues, such as [[opposition to abortion]] and [[homosexuality]]. Religious conservatives often assert that \"America is a Christian nation\" and call for laws that enforce [[Christian morality]].\n\nFiscal conservatives support limited government, low tax, low spending, and a balanced budget. They argue that low taxes produce more jobs and wealth for everyone, and, as President Grover Cleveland said, \"unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation\".<ref>Grover Cleveland, \"The President's message, 1887\" (1887) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4cApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA37&dq=%22unnecessary+taxation+is+unjust+taxation%22+Grover+OR+Cleveland&hl=en&ei=wQnkTePyOOfeiAKJ0Y2TBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTgK online p. 37]</ref> A recent movement against the inheritance tax labels such a tax as a [[death tax]]. Fiscal conservatives often argue that competition in the free market is more effective than the regulation of industry. Some make exceptions in the case of trusts or monopolies. Others, such as some libertarians and followers of [[Ludwig von Mises]], believe all government intervention in the economy is wasteful, corrupt, and immoral. More moderate fiscal conservatives argue that \"[[free market]] economics\" is the most efficient way to promote [[economic growth]].\n\nMany modern American fiscal conservatives accept some social spending programs not specifically delineated in the Constitution. However, some American fiscal conservatives view wider social liberalism as an impetus for increased spending on these programs. As such, fiscal conservatism today exists somewhere between classical liberalism and contemporary consequentialist political philosophies, and is often influenced by coinciding levels of social conservatism.<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite journal|title=True believers|journal=The Economist\n|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/06/conservatives-0\n|accessdate=February 8, 2018|date=June 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Gallup Poll\">{{cite web|title=In U.S., Nearly Half Identify as Economically Conservative|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/154889/Nearly-Half-Identify-Economically-Conservative.aspx\n|accessdate=February 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThrough much of the 20th century, a primary force uniting the varied strands of conservatism, and uniting conservatives with liberals and socialists, was opposition to communism, which was seen not only as an enemy of the traditional order, but also the enemy of Western freedom and democracy.

They often denounce anti-war protesters and support the police and the military. They hold that military institutions embody core values such as honor, duty, courage, loyalty, and a willingness on the part of the individual to make sacrifices for the good of the country.\n\nSocial conservatives are strongest in the South and in recent years played a major role in the political coalitions of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]].<ref>Darren Dochuk, ''From Bible Belt to Sun Belt: Plain-Folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical Conservatism'' (W.W.

Fiscal conservatives since the 19th century have argued that debt is a device to corrupt politics; they argue that big spending ruins the morals of the people, and that a national debt creates a dangerous class of speculators. A political strategy employed by conservatives to achieve a smaller government is known as [[starve the beast]]. Activist [[Grover Norquist]] is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, \"My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041120220704/http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archivedate=November 20, 2004 |title=Starving the Beast |author=Ed Kilgore |work=Blueprint Magazine |accessdate=December 9, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9335 |title=Article &#124; The American Prospect |publisher=Prospect.org |date=March 15, 2005 |accessdate=December 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The argument in favor of [[balanced budget]]s is often coupled with a belief that government welfare programs should be narrowly tailored and that tax rates should be low, which implies relatively small government institutions.\n\nThis belief in small government combines with fiscal conservatism to produce a broader economic liberalism that wishes to minimize government intervention in the economy or implement ''laissez-faire'' policies. This economic liberalism borrows from two schools of thought: the classical liberals' pragmatism and the libertarians' notion of \"rights.\" The classical liberal maintains that free markets work best, while the libertarian contends that free markets are the only ethical markets.\n\nHistorian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that [[classical liberalism in the United States]] during the 19th century had distinctive characteristics as opposed to Britain:\n<blockquote>[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kathleen G. Donohue|title=Freedom from Want: American Liberalism and the Idea of the Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7TN4Asro8C&pg=PA2|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=2|isbn=9780801883910}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe economic philosophy of American conservatives tends to be more liberal allowing for more [[economic freedom]]. [[Economic liberalism]] can go well beyond fiscal conservatism's concern for fiscal prudence, to a belief or principle that it is not prudent for governments to intervene in markets. It is also sometimes extended to a broader [[small government]] philosophy. Economic liberalism is associated with [[free-market]] or ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics.\n\nInsofar as it is ideological, economic liberalism owes its creation to the [[classical liberal]] tradition in the vein of [[Adam Smith]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], and [[Ludwig von Mises]].\n\nClassical liberals and libertarians support free markets on moral, ideological grounds: principles of individual liberty morally dictate support for free markets. Supporters of the moral grounds for free markets include [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see free market capitalism as the preferable means of achieving economic ends.\n\nModern conservatives, on the other hand, derive support for free markets from practical grounds. They argue that free markets are the most productive markets. Thus the modern conservative supports free markets not out of necessity, but out of expedience. The support is not moral or ideological, but driven on the [[Burkean]] notion of prescription: what works best is what is right.\n\nA belief in the importance of the [[civil society]] is another reason why conservatives support a smaller role for the government in the economy. As noted by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], there is a belief that a bigger role of the government in the economy will make people feel less responsible for the society. These responsibilities would then need to be taken over by the government, requiring higher taxes. In his book ''[[Democracy in America]]'', Tocqueville described this as \"soft oppression\".\n\n[[File:Ronald Reagan TV Address 1981.ogv|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]] gives a televised address from the [[Oval Office]], outlining his plan for tax reductions in July 1981 (excerpt)]]\nWhile classical liberals and modern conservatives reached free markets through different means historically, in recent years the lines have blurred. Rarely will a conservative politician claim that free markets are \"simply more productive\" or \"simply the right thing to do\" but a combination of both. This blurring is very much a product of the merging of the classical liberal and modern conservative positions under the \"umbrella\" of the conservative movement.\n\nThe archetypal free-market conservative administrations of the late 20th century\u2014the [[Margaret Thatcher]] government in Britain and the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration in the U.S.\u2014both held unfettered operation of the market to be the cornerstone of contemporary modern conservatism.<ref>Dieter Plehwe, Bernhard Walpen, Gisela Neunh\u00f6ffer (eds), ''Neoliberal Hegemony: A Global Critique,'' [[Routledge]] (February 8, 2006), {{ISBN|0415460034}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kiaxAx5l1QEC&pg=PA1 p. 1].</ref> To that end, Thatcher privatized industries and public housing, and Reagan cut the maximum capital gains tax from 28% to 20%, though in his second term he agreed to raise it back up to 28%.

He increased defense spending, but liberal Democrats blocked his efforts to cut domestic spending.<ref>Steven F.

Federal revenues as a percent of the GDP fell from 19.6% in 1981 when Reagan took office to 18.3% in 1989 when he left. Federal spending fell slightly from 22.2% of the GDP to 21.2%.

Political conservatism has been an important aspect of the American Legion since the 1920s. The American Legion always paid very close attention to domestic subversion, especially the threat of domestic communism. However, it paid little attention to foreign affairs before 1945. It ignored the League of Nations. It was hostile to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 that rolled back the naval arms race in the 1920s. Pacifism was popular in the 1920s, and Legion locals ridiculed it and sometimes booed the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. During World War II, it accepted the wartime alliance with Stalin against Nazi Germany. As the Cold War emerged in 1946\u20131947, the Legion paid increasing attention to an anti-Soviet foreign policy.<ref>Morten Bach, \"None so consistently right: The American Legion's Cold War, 1945\u20131950,\" (PhD dissertation, Ohio University, 2007) [https://search.proquest.com/openview/15fb275644e81638d7f181805d0899c9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y Excerpt]</ref> Its Counter-Subversive Activities Committee in 1946 began publishing the ''American Legion Firing Line,'' a newsletter for members which provides information on communist, fascist, and other extremist groups to its subscribers. It warned members against far-right groups such as the [[John Birch Society]] and anti-Semitic groups. By the late 1950s, the newsletter became much more interested in foreign affairs.<ref>Ronald Lora and William Henry Longton, ''The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America'' (1999) pp  479\u201388.</ref>\n\nThe Legion's policy resolutions endorsed large-scale defense spending and the deployment of powerful new weapon systems from the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s to Reagan's [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] in the 1980s. Harry Truman was the first Legionnaire to occupy the White House, but he came under Legion attack for waging a limited war in Korea and not following the advice of General Douglas MacArthur in attacking China. By 1961, the Legion outright rejected the policy of containment, and called for the liberation of the captive peoples in Eastern Europe. The Legion publications typically hailed Barry Goldwater, a member, as a political role model, but like Goldwater and William F. Buckley, they rejected the extremism of the [[John Birch Society]]. The Legion supported increased intervention in Vietnam and support of anti-Communist forces in Central America and Afghanistan.  The Legion never saw much benefit in the United Nations, and like other conservatives worried about a loss of American sovereignty to international bodies. The collapse of Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe and in Russia itself saw the American Legion looking to new venues for militaristic action. Thus, it praised President George H.W. Bush's intervention in Kuwait against Iraq in 1990. After 9\u201311, it vigorously endorsed President George W. Bush's strategy of a global war on terror, and it supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.<ref>Timothy J Lynch, ed.

Vitale]] decision banned state-written prayers in public schools. White evangelicals mostly supported that decision. However, they saw the 1963 [[Abington School District v. Schempp]] decision to ban school-sponsored Bible reading and school-organized praying of the Lord's Prayer from those schools as an affront. The Supreme Court ruled that prayer organized by the school was not voluntary since students were coerced or publicly embarrassed if they did not follow along. Nevertheless, the conservatives continued to call for voluntary school prayer, which is already protected under law, and repeatedly attacked the Supreme Court on this issue and on other issues, especially abortion. The evangelicals had long been avid supporters of the public schools. Now they had to reconsider their place in both schools and society as a whole. They concluded with surprising unanimity that those school decisions had done more than forced evangelical belief out of America's public schools; the decisions had pushed evangelicals themselves out of America's mainstream culture. Alienated, they moved into the [[Christian Right|religious right]] and by 1980 were avid supporters of [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&pg=PA357|year=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=357|isbn=9780415943420}}</ref><ref>Adam Laats, \"Our schools, our country: American evangelicals, public schools, and the Supreme Court decisions of 1962 and 1963.\" ''Journal of religious history'' 36.3 (2012): 319\u2013334.</ref><ref>William M.

Since 1964, the conservatives largely took control. Meanwhile, the conservative wing of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], based in the South and strongly opposed to [[Civil Rights]], grew weaker. The most dramatic realignment took place within the White South, which moved from 3\u20131 Democratic to 3\u20131 Republican between 1960 and 2000.\n\nIn addition, some American libertarians, in the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and even some in the Republican Party, see themselves as conservative, even though they advocate significant economic and social changes\u2014for instance, further dismantling the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare system]] or liberalizing drug policy. They see these as conservative policies because they conform to the spirit of individual liberty that they consider to be a traditional American value.

They want government intervention to support the economy and protect American jobs. They oppose free trade on the ground that it benefits other countries (especially China) at the expense of American workers. However, in spite of their support for protectionism, they tend to support other free-market principles like low taxes, small government and balanced budgets.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Geography ===\n[[File:Conservative Gallup 8-10.svg|thumb|Percent of self-identified conservatives by state in 2010:{{update inline|date=January 2019}}<ref name=\"gallup-consverative-poll\">{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jeffrey|title=Wyoming, Mississippi, Utah Rank as Most Conservative States|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/141677/Wyoming-Mississippi-Utah-Rank-Conservative-States.aspx|website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}</ref>\n{{legend|#ca2521;|49% and above}}\n{{legend|#d54a42;|45\u201348%}}\n{{legend|#df7064;|41\u201344%}}\n{{legend|#ea9585;|37\u201340%}}\n{{legend|#f4baa6;|33\u201336%}}\n{{legend|#ffe0c8;|32% and under}}\n]]\nThe [[Southern United States|South]], the [[Great Plains]], the [[Rocky Mountain states]], and [[Alaska]] are generally conservative strongholds.

Russello described as follows:\n# A belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, [[divine revelation]], or [[natural law]].\n# An affection for the \"variety and mystery\" of human existence.\n# A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize natural distinctions.\n# A belief that property and freedom are closely linked.\n# A faith in custom, convention, and prescription.\n# A recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which entails a respect for the political value of prudence.<ref>Russello, Gerald J., 1996, \"The Jurisprudence of Russell Kirk,\" ''Modern Age'' 38: 354\u2013363. {{ISSN|0026-7457}}.</ref>\n\nKirk said that Christianity and [[Western culture|Western civilization]] are \"unimaginable apart from one another\"<ref>[http://www.robertsgriffin.com/ConservBookshelf.pdf Book Review] by Robert S.

In 1910, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] broke with most of his lawyer friends and called for popular votes that could overturn unwelcome decisions by state courts. Taft denounced his old friend and rallied conservatives to defeat him for the 1912 GOP nomination. Taft and the conservative Republicans controlled the Supreme Court until the late 1930s.<ref>Lewis L. Gould, ''The William Howard Taft Presidency'' (2009) p. 175</ref><ref>Mark A. Graber and Michael Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p. 111.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], a liberal Democrat, did not attack the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] directly in 1937, but ignited a firestorm of protest by a proposal to add seven new justices. Conservative Democrats immediately broke with FDR, defeated his proposal, and built up the [[Conservative coalition]]. While the liberals did take over the Court through replacements, they lost control of Congress. That is, the Court no longer overthrew liberal laws passed by Congress, but there were very few such laws that passed in 1937\u201360.<ref>Jeff Shesol, ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court'' (2010) p. 525.</ref>\n\nConservatives' views of the courts are based on their beliefs: maintaining the present state of affairs, conventional and rule-oriented, and disapproval of government power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/conservatives-and-the-court|title=Conservatives and the Court|access-date=October 24, 2018}}</ref> A recent variant of conservatism condemns \"judicial activism\"; that is, judges using their decisions to control policy, along the lines of the [[Warren Court]] in the 1960s. It came under conservative attack for decisions regarding redistricting, desegregation, and the rights of those accused of crimes. This position goes back to Jefferson's vehement attacks on federal judges and to [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s attacks on the [[Dred Scott]] decision of 1857.<ref>Graber and Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p114</ref><ref>Mark V.

Originalism should not be confused with a similar conservative ideology, [[strict constructionism]], which deals with the interpretation of the Constitution as written, but not necessarily within the context of the time when it was adopted. In modern times, the term originalism has been used by Supreme Court justice [[Antonin Scalia]], former federal judge [[Robert Bork]] and some other conservative jurists to explain their beliefs.<ref>Johnathan O'Neill, ''Originalism in American law and politics: a constitutional history'' (2005) pp. 7\u201311, 208.</ref>\n\n==== Federalism ====\nAccording to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor writing for the majority in Gregory v. Ashcroft 501 U.S. 452 (1991), there are significant advantages to federalism and the recognition of state rights:\n<blockquote>The federalist structure of joint sovereigns preserves to the people numerous advantages. It assures a decentralized government that will be more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society; it increases opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes; it allows for more innovation and experimentation in government; and it makes government more responsive by putting the States in competition for a mobile citizenry.<ref>Center for the Study of Federalism, \"U.S. Constitution'' (2017) [http://encyclopedia.federalism.org/index.php/U.S._Constitution online].</ref></blockquote>\n\nFrom the left, law professor Herman Schwartz argues that Rehnquist's reliance on federalism and state's rights have been a \"Fig Leaf for conservatives\":\n<blockquote>Today's conservative Supreme Court majority, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, has imposed limitations on federal power to curtail the rights of women, religious groups, the elderly, racial minorities, and other disadvantaged groups. [...] The conservatives have shrunk the scope of the commerce clause, developed implied limitations on federal authority, and narrowly construed the Civil War amendments.<ref>Herman Schwartz, \"The Supreme Court's federalism: Fig leaf for conservatives.\" The ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' 574.1 (2001): 119\u2013131.

Labor historians Jefferson Cowie and Nick Salvatore argue the New Deal was a short-term response to depression and did not mark a permanent commitment to a welfare state, claiming that America has always been too individualistic and too hostile to labor unions to ever embrace liberalism for any extended period of time. This new interpretation argues that conservatism has largely dominated American politics since the 1920s, with the brief exceptions of the New Deal era (1933\u20131938) and the Great Society (1964\u20131966).<ref name=\"Jefferson Cowie 2008\">Jefferson Cowie, and Nick Salvatore, \"The Long Exception: Rethinking the Place of the New Deal in American History,\" ''International Labor & Working-Class History,'' (2008) 74: 3\u201332.</ref> However, historian Julian Zelizer argues that \"The coherence of conservatism has been exaggerated.

He wrote, \"The Right of these freewheeling decades was a genuine Right: it was led by the rich and well-placed; it was skeptical of popular government; it was opposed to all parties, unions, leagues, or other movements that sought to invade its positions of power and profit; it was politically, socially, and culturally anti-radical.\" His \"giants of American conservatism\" were [[John Adams]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Marshall]], [[Daniel Webster]], [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Elihu Root]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He added that Washington and Lincoln transcend the usual categories, but that conservatives \"may argue with some conviction that Washington and Lincoln can also be added to his list.\"\n\nRossiter went to note the importance of other conservative leaders over the past two centuries. Among the fathers of the Constitution, which he calls \"a triumph of conservative statesmanship\", Rossiter said conservatives may \"take special pride\" in [[James Madison]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], [[Roger Sherman]], [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]], [[Gouverneur Morris]] and the Pinckneys of South Carolina. For the early 19th century, Rossiter said the libertarians and constitutionalists who deserve the conservative spotlight for their fight against [[Jacksonian democracy]] include [[Joseph Story]] and [[Josiah Quincy III|Josiah Quincy]] in Massachusetts; Chancellor [[James Kent]] in New York; [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Randolph of Roanoke]] in Virginia.\n\nIn the decades around 1900, Rossiter finds that [[Grover Cleveland]], [[Elihu Root]], [[William Howard Taft]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] \"were most successful in shaping the old truths of conservatism to the new facts of industrialism and democracy.\" In what Rossiter called the \"Great Train Robbery of Intellectual History\", the laissez-faire conservatives appropriated the themes of classical liberalism\u2014especially liberty, opportunity, progress, and individualism, and packaged them into an ideology that supported the property rights of big corporations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard K.

Kirk's use of the word \"prejudice\" here is not intended to carry its contemporary pejorative connotation: a conservative himself, he believed that the inherited wisdom of the ages may be a better guide than apparently rational individual judgment.\n\nThere are two overlapping subgroups of social conservatives\u2014the traditional and the religious. Traditional conservatives strongly support traditional codes of conduct, especially those they feel are threatened by social change and modernization. For example, traditional conservatives may oppose the use of female soldiers in combat. Religious conservatives focus on conducting society as prescribed by a religious authority or code. In the United States, this translates into hard-line stances on moral issues, such as [[opposition to abortion]] and [[homosexuality]]. Religious conservatives often assert that \"America is a Christian nation\" and call for laws that enforce [[Christian morality]].\n\nFiscal conservatives support limited government, low tax, low spending, and a balanced budget. They argue that low taxes produce more jobs and wealth for everyone, and, as President Grover Cleveland said, \"unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation\".<ref>Grover Cleveland, \"The President's message, 1887\" (1887) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4cApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA37&dq=%22unnecessary+taxation+is+unjust+taxation%22+Grover+OR+Cleveland&hl=en&ei=wQnkTePyOOfeiAKJ0Y2TBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTgK online p. 37]</ref> A recent movement against the inheritance tax labels such a tax as a [[death tax]]. Fiscal conservatives often argue that competition in the free market is more effective than the regulation of industry. Some make exceptions in the case of trusts or monopolies. Others, such as some libertarians and followers of [[Ludwig von Mises]], believe all government intervention in the economy is wasteful, corrupt, and immoral. More moderate fiscal conservatives argue that \"[[free market]] economics\" is the most efficient way to promote [[economic growth]].\n\nMany modern American fiscal conservatives accept some social spending programs not specifically delineated in the Constitution. However, some American fiscal conservatives view wider social liberalism as an impetus for increased spending on these programs. As such, fiscal conservatism today exists somewhere between classical liberalism and contemporary consequentialist political philosophies, and is often influenced by coinciding levels of social conservatism.<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite journal|title=True believers|journal=The Economist\n|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/06/conservatives-0\n|accessdate=February 8, 2018|date=June 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Gallup Poll\">{{cite web|title=In U.S., Nearly Half Identify as Economically Conservative|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/154889/Nearly-Half-Identify-Economically-Conservative.aspx\n|accessdate=February 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThrough much of the 20th century, a primary force uniting the varied strands of conservatism, and uniting conservatives with liberals and socialists, was opposition to communism, which was seen not only as an enemy of the traditional order, but also the enemy of Western freedom and democracy.

Fiscal conservatives since the 19th century have argued that debt is a device to corrupt politics; they argue that big spending ruins the morals of the people, and that a national debt creates a dangerous class of speculators. A political strategy employed by conservatives to achieve a smaller government is known as [[starve the beast]]. Activist [[Grover Norquist]] is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, \"My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041120220704/http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archivedate=November 20, 2004 |title=Starving the Beast |author=Ed Kilgore |work=Blueprint Magazine |accessdate=December 9, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9335 |title=Article &#124; The American Prospect |publisher=Prospect.org |date=March 15, 2005 |accessdate=December 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The argument in favor of [[balanced budget]]s is often coupled with a belief that government welfare programs should be narrowly tailored and that tax rates should be low, which implies relatively small government institutions.\n\nThis belief in small government combines with fiscal conservatism to produce a broader economic liberalism that wishes to minimize government intervention in the economy or implement ''laissez-faire'' policies. This economic liberalism borrows from two schools of thought: the classical liberals' pragmatism and the libertarians' notion of \"rights.\" The classical liberal maintains that free markets work best, while the libertarian contends that free markets are the only ethical markets.\n\nHistorian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that [[classical liberalism in the United States]] during the 19th century had distinctive characteristics as opposed to Britain:\n<blockquote>[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kathleen G. Donohue|title=Freedom from Want: American Liberalism and the Idea of the Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7TN4Asro8C&pg=PA2|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=2|isbn=9780801883910}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe economic philosophy of American conservatives tends to be more liberal allowing for more [[economic freedom]]. [[Economic liberalism]] can go well beyond fiscal conservatism's concern for fiscal prudence, to a belief or principle that it is not prudent for governments to intervene in markets. It is also sometimes extended to a broader [[small government]] philosophy. Economic liberalism is associated with [[free-market]] or ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics.\n\nInsofar as it is ideological, economic liberalism owes its creation to the [[classical liberal]] tradition in the vein of [[Adam Smith]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], and [[Ludwig von Mises]].\n\nClassical liberals and libertarians support free markets on moral, ideological grounds: principles of individual liberty morally dictate support for free markets. Supporters of the moral grounds for free markets include [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see free market capitalism as the preferable means of achieving economic ends.\n\nModern conservatives, on the other hand, derive support for free markets from practical grounds. They argue that free markets are the most productive markets. Thus the modern conservative supports free markets not out of necessity, but out of expedience. The support is not moral or ideological, but driven on the [[Burkean]] notion of prescription: what works best is what is right.\n\nA belief in the importance of the [[civil society]] is another reason why conservatives support a smaller role for the government in the economy. As noted by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], there is a belief that a bigger role of the government in the economy will make people feel less responsible for the society. These responsibilities would then need to be taken over by the government, requiring higher taxes. In his book ''[[Democracy in America]]'', Tocqueville described this as \"soft oppression\".\n\n[[File:Ronald Reagan TV Address 1981.ogv|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]] gives a televised address from the [[Oval Office]], outlining his plan for tax reductions in July 1981 (excerpt)]]\nWhile classical liberals and modern conservatives reached free markets through different means historically, in recent years the lines have blurred. Rarely will a conservative politician claim that free markets are \"simply more productive\" or \"simply the right thing to do\" but a combination of both. This blurring is very much a product of the merging of the classical liberal and modern conservative positions under the \"umbrella\" of the conservative movement.\n\nThe archetypal free-market conservative administrations of the late 20th century\u2014the [[Margaret Thatcher]] government in Britain and the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration in the U.S.\u2014both held unfettered operation of the market to be the cornerstone of contemporary modern conservatism.<ref>Dieter Plehwe, Bernhard Walpen, Gisela Neunh\u00f6ffer (eds), ''Neoliberal Hegemony: A Global Critique,'' [[Routledge]] (February 8, 2006), {{ISBN|0415460034}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kiaxAx5l1QEC&pg=PA1 p. 1].</ref> To that end, Thatcher privatized industries and public housing, and Reagan cut the maximum capital gains tax from 28% to 20%, though in his second term he agreed to raise it back up to 28%.

He increased defense spending, but liberal Democrats blocked his efforts to cut domestic spending.<ref>Steven F.

Political conservatism has been an important aspect of the American Legion since the 1920s. The American Legion always paid very close attention to domestic subversion, especially the threat of domestic communism. However, it paid little attention to foreign affairs before 1945. It ignored the League of Nations. It was hostile to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 that rolled back the naval arms race in the 1920s. Pacifism was popular in the 1920s, and Legion locals ridiculed it and sometimes booed the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. During World War II, it accepted the wartime alliance with Stalin against Nazi Germany. As the Cold War emerged in 1946\u20131947, the Legion paid increasing attention to an anti-Soviet foreign policy.<ref>Morten Bach, \"None so consistently right: The American Legion's Cold War, 1945\u20131950,\" (PhD dissertation, Ohio University, 2007) [https://search.proquest.com/openview/15fb275644e81638d7f181805d0899c9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y Excerpt]</ref> Its Counter-Subversive Activities Committee in 1946 began publishing the ''American Legion Firing Line,'' a newsletter for members which provides information on communist, fascist, and other extremist groups to its subscribers. It warned members against far-right groups such as the [[John Birch Society]] and anti-Semitic groups. By the late 1950s, the newsletter became much more interested in foreign affairs.<ref>Ronald Lora and William Henry Longton, ''The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America'' (1999) pp  479\u201388.</ref>\n\nThe Legion's policy resolutions endorsed large-scale defense spending and the deployment of powerful new weapon systems from the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s to Reagan's [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] in the 1980s. Harry Truman was the first Legionnaire to occupy the White House, but he came under Legion attack for waging a limited war in Korea and not following the advice of General Douglas MacArthur in attacking China. By 1961, the Legion outright rejected the policy of containment, and called for the liberation of the captive peoples in Eastern Europe. The Legion publications typically hailed Barry Goldwater, a member, as a political role model, but like Goldwater and William F. Buckley, they rejected the extremism of the [[John Birch Society]]. The Legion supported increased intervention in Vietnam and support of anti-Communist forces in Central America and Afghanistan.  The Legion never saw much benefit in the United Nations, and like other conservatives worried about a loss of American sovereignty to international bodies. The collapse of Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe and in Russia itself saw the American Legion looking to new venues for militaristic action. Thus, it praised President George H.W.

Vitale]] decision banned state-written prayers in public schools. White evangelicals mostly supported that decision. However, they saw the 1963 [[Abington School District v. Schempp]] decision to ban school-sponsored Bible reading and school-organized praying of the Lord's Prayer from those schools as an affront. The Supreme Court ruled that prayer organized by the school was not voluntary since students were coerced or publicly embarrassed if they did not follow along. Nevertheless, the conservatives continued to call for voluntary school prayer, which is already protected under law, and repeatedly attacked the Supreme Court on this issue and on other issues, especially abortion. The evangelicals had long been avid supporters of the public schools. Now they had to reconsider their place in both schools and society as a whole. They concluded with surprising unanimity that those school decisions had done more than forced evangelical belief out of America's public schools; the decisions had pushed evangelicals themselves out of America's mainstream culture. Alienated, they moved into the [[Christian Right|religious right]] and by 1980 were avid supporters of [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&pg=PA357|year=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=357|isbn=9780415943420}}</ref><ref>Adam Laats, \"Our schools, our country: American evangelicals, public schools, and the Supreme Court decisions of 1962 and 1963.\" ''Journal of religious history'' 36.3 (2012): 319\u2013334.</ref><ref>William M.

The trend is most pronounced among the \"least well-off, least educated, most blue collar, most economically hard-hit states.\" according to ''Atlantic'' writer [[Richard Florida]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Florida |first1=Richard |year=2012 |title=Why America Keeps Getting More Conservative |journal=The Atlantic |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/02/why-america-keeps-getting-more-conservative/252995/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Florida |first1=Richard |year=2011 |title=The Conservative States of America |journal=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/03/the-conservative-states-of-america/71827/ }}</ref>\n\nConservatives generally believe that government action is not the solution to problems such as poverty and inequality. Many believe that government programs that seek to provide services and opportunities for the poor actually encourage dependence and reduce self-reliance. Most conservatives oppose [[affirmative action]] policies, that is, policies in employment, education, and other areas that give special advantages to people who belong to groups that have been historically discriminated against. Conservatives believe that the government should not give special benefits to people on the basis of group identity and oppose it as \"[[reverse discrimination]]\".{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nConservatives typically hold that the government should play a smaller role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose high tax rates and programs to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work. However, conservatives usually place a strong emphasis on the role of private voluntary charitable organizations (especially faith-based charities) in helping the poor.\n\n=== Social issues ===\nOn social issues, many religious conservatives oppose changes in traditional moral standards regarding sexuality and gender roles. They oppose abortion, same-sex marriage, and anti-discrimination laws against homosexuals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony Stanford|title=Homophobia in the Black Church: How Faith, Politics, and Fear Divide the Black Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zu4aIFxQ7VwC&pg=PA101|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=101|isbn=9780313398698}}</ref> The libertarian faction tends to ignore these issues, instead focusing on fiscal and monetary policy.

Since 1964, the conservatives largely took control. Meanwhile, the conservative wing of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], based in the South and strongly opposed to [[Civil Rights]], grew weaker. The most dramatic realignment took place within the White South, which moved from 3\u20131 Democratic to 3\u20131 Republican between 1960 and 2000.\n\nIn addition, some American libertarians, in the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and even some in the Republican Party, see themselves as conservative, even though they advocate significant economic and social changes\u2014for instance, further dismantling the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare system]] or liberalizing drug policy. They see these as conservative policies because they conform to the spirit of individual liberty that they consider to be a traditional American value. However, many libertarian think-tanks such as the [[Cato Institute]], and libertarian intellectuals such as [[David Boaz]] describe libertarianism as being \"socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\"<ref name=Moseley>{{Cite journal|last=Moseley|first=Daniel|title=What is Libertarianism?|journal=Basic Income Studies|date=June 25, 2011|volume=6|issue=2|page=2|ssrn=1872578|accessdate=|doi=10.1515/1932-0183.1215}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Boaz|first=David|title=The Libertarian Vote in the Age of Obama|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/libertarian-vote-age-obama|work=Policy Analysis|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=February 24, 2012|author2=David Kirby|date=January 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, some conservatives tend to oppose free-market trade policies and support [[protectionism]] instead. They want government intervention to support the economy and protect American jobs. They oppose free trade on the ground that it benefits other countries (especially China) at the expense of American workers. However, in spite of their support for protectionism, they tend to support other free-market principles like low taxes, small government and balanced budgets.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Geography ===\n[[File:Conservative Gallup 8-10.svg|thumb|Percent of self-identified conservatives by state in 2010:{{update inline|date=January 2019}}<ref name=\"gallup-consverative-poll\">{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jeffrey|title=Wyoming, Mississippi, Utah Rank as Most Conservative States|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/141677/Wyoming-Mississippi-Utah-Rank-Conservative-States.aspx|website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}</ref>\n{{legend|#ca2521;|49% and above}}\n{{legend|#d54a42;|45\u201348%}}\n{{legend|#df7064;|41\u201344%}}\n{{legend|#ea9585;|37\u201340%}}\n{{legend|#f4baa6;|33\u201336%}}\n{{legend|#ffe0c8;|32% and under}}\n]]\nThe [[Southern United States|South]], the [[Great Plains]], the [[Rocky Mountain states]], and [[Alaska]] are generally conservative strongholds.

Russello described as follows:\n# A belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, [[divine revelation]], or [[natural law]].\n# An affection for the \"variety and mystery\" of human existence.\n# A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize natural distinctions.\n# A belief that property and freedom are closely linked.\n# A faith in custom, convention, and prescription.\n# A recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which entails a respect for the political value of prudence.<ref>Russello, Gerald J., 1996, \"The Jurisprudence of Russell Kirk,\" ''Modern Age'' 38: 354\u2013363. {{ISSN|0026-7457}}.</ref>\n\nKirk said that Christianity and [[Western culture|Western civilization]] are \"unimaginable apart from one another\"<ref>[http://www.robertsgriffin.com/ConservBookshelf.pdf Book Review] by Robert S.

In 1910, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] broke with most of his lawyer friends and called for popular votes that could overturn unwelcome decisions by state courts. Taft denounced his old friend and rallied conservatives to defeat him for the 1912 GOP nomination. Taft and the conservative Republicans controlled the Supreme Court until the late 1930s.<ref>Lewis L. Gould, ''The William Howard Taft Presidency'' (2009) p. 175</ref><ref>Mark A. Graber and Michael Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p. 111.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], a liberal Democrat, did not attack the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] directly in 1937, but ignited a firestorm of protest by a proposal to add seven new justices. Conservative Democrats immediately broke with FDR, defeated his proposal, and built up the [[Conservative coalition]]. While the liberals did take over the Court through replacements, they lost control of Congress. That is, the Court no longer overthrew liberal laws passed by Congress, but there were very few such laws that passed in 1937\u201360.<ref>Jeff Shesol, ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court'' (2010) p. 525.</ref>\n\nConservatives' views of the courts are based on their beliefs: maintaining the present state of affairs, conventional and rule-oriented, and disapproval of government power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/conservatives-and-the-court|title=Conservatives and the Court|access-date=October 24, 2018}}</ref> A recent variant of conservatism condemns \"judicial activism\"; that is, judges using their decisions to control policy, along the lines of the [[Warren Court]] in the 1960s. It came under conservative attack for decisions regarding redistricting, desegregation, and the rights of those accused of crimes. This position goes back to Jefferson's vehement attacks on federal judges and to [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s attacks on the [[Dred Scott]] decision of 1857.<ref>Graber and Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p114</ref><ref>Mark V.

Originalism should not be confused with a similar conservative ideology, [[strict constructionism]], which deals with the interpretation of the Constitution as written, but not necessarily within the context of the time when it was adopted. In modern times, the term originalism has been used by Supreme Court justice [[Antonin Scalia]], former federal judge [[Robert Bork]] and some other conservative jurists to explain their beliefs.<ref>Johnathan O'Neill, ''Originalism in American law and politics: a constitutional history'' (2005) pp. 7\u201311, 208.</ref>\n\n==== Federalism ====\nAccording to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor writing for the majority in Gregory v. Ashcroft 501 U.S. 452 (1991), there are significant advantages to federalism and the recognition of state rights:\n<blockquote>The federalist structure of joint sovereigns preserves to the people numerous advantages. It assures a decentralized government that will be more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society; it increases opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes; it allows for more innovation and experimentation in government; and it makes government more responsive by putting the States in competition for a mobile citizenry.<ref>Center for the Study of Federalism, \"U.S. Constitution'' (2017) [http://encyclopedia.federalism.org/index.php/U.S._Constitution online].</ref></blockquote>\n\nFrom the left, law professor Herman Schwartz argues that Rehnquist's reliance on federalism and state's rights have been a \"Fig Leaf for conservatives\":\n<blockquote>Today's conservative Supreme Court majority, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, has imposed limitations on federal power to curtail the rights of women, religious groups, the elderly, racial minorities, and other disadvantaged groups. [...] The conservatives have shrunk the scope of the commerce clause, developed implied limitations on federal authority, and narrowly construed the Civil War amendments.<ref>Herman Schwartz, \"The Supreme Court's federalism: Fig leaf for conservatives.\" The ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' 574.1 (2001): 119\u2013131.

Labor historians Jefferson Cowie and Nick Salvatore argue the New Deal was a short-term response to depression and did not mark a permanent commitment to a welfare state, claiming that America has always been too individualistic and too hostile to labor unions to ever embrace liberalism for any extended period of time. This new interpretation argues that conservatism has largely dominated American politics since the 1920s, with the brief exceptions of the New Deal era (1933\u20131938) and the Great Society (1964\u20131966).<ref name=\"Jefferson Cowie 2008\">Jefferson Cowie, and Nick Salvatore, \"The Long Exception: Rethinking the Place of the New Deal in American History,\" ''International Labor & Working-Class History,'' (2008) 74: 3\u201332.</ref> However, historian Julian Zelizer argues that \"The coherence of conservatism has been exaggerated. The movement was as fragile as the New Deal coalition that it replaced. [...] Policy change has thus proved to be much more difficult than conservatives hoped for.\"<ref>Julian E. Zelizer, \"Rethinking the History of American Conservatism,\" ''Reviews in American History'' (2010) 38#2 pp. 367\u2013392, quoting pp. 372, 379.</ref> Zelizer does find four areas where conservatives did make major changes, namely retrenchment of domestic programs, lowering taxes, deregulation, and opposition to labor unions. He concludes, \"The fact is that liberalism survived the rise of conservatism.\"<ref>Zelizer, \"Rethinking the History of American Conservatism,\" p. 379, quote p. 380.</ref>\n\n=== American exceptionalism ===\n{{main|American exceptionalism}}\nAmerican conservatives typically promote [[American exceptionalism]], the idea that the United States is inherently different from other nations and has a duty to take the lead in spreading democracy and free markets to the world.

Alford, ''Predisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Biology of Political Differences'', Routledge, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0415535878}}.</ref> three respected scholars provide an in-depth psychological explanation of how a person's genetic makeup predisposes them to be liberal or conservative. The book provides telling examples of how people as erudite and thoughtful as William F. Buckley Jr., Gore Vidal, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson descend to insults, lawsuits, duels, and slander when they are unable to defend their positions by rational argument.\n\n=== Clinton Rossiter's Giants ===\n[[Clinton Rossiter]], a leading expert on American political history, published his history of ''Conservatism in America'' (1956) and also a summary article on \"The Giants Of American Conservatism\" in ''American Heritage''.<ref>Rossiter, Clinton, [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/giants-american-conservatism \"The Giants of American Conservatism\"], ''American Heritage'' 1955 6(6): 56\u201359, 94\u201396</ref> His goal was to identify the \"great men who did conservative deeds, thought conservative thoughts, practiced conservative virtues, and stood for conservative principles.\" To Rossiter, conservatism was defined by the rule of the upper class. He wrote, \"The Right of these freewheeling decades was a genuine Right: it was led by the rich and well-placed; it was skeptical of popular government; it was opposed to all parties, unions, leagues, or other movements that sought to invade its positions of power and profit; it was politically, socially, and culturally anti-radical.\" His \"giants of American conservatism\" were [[John Adams]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Marshall]], [[Daniel Webster]], [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Elihu Root]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He added that Washington and Lincoln transcend the usual categories, but that conservatives \"may argue with some conviction that Washington and Lincoln can also be added to his list.\"\n\nRossiter went to note the importance of other conservative leaders over the past two centuries. Among the fathers of the Constitution, which he calls \"a triumph of conservative statesmanship\", Rossiter said conservatives may \"take special pride\" in [[James Madison]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], [[Roger Sherman]], [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]], [[Gouverneur Morris]] and the Pinckneys of South Carolina. For the early 19th century, Rossiter said the libertarians and constitutionalists who deserve the conservative spotlight for their fight against [[Jacksonian democracy]] include [[Joseph Story]] and [[Josiah Quincy III|Josiah Quincy]] in Massachusetts; Chancellor [[James Kent]] in New York; [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Randolph of Roanoke]] in Virginia.\n\nIn the decades around 1900, Rossiter finds that [[Grover Cleveland]], [[Elihu Root]], [[William Howard Taft]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] \"were most successful in shaping the old truths of conservatism to the new facts of industrialism and democracy.\" In what Rossiter called the \"Great Train Robbery of Intellectual History\", the laissez-faire conservatives appropriated the themes of classical liberalism\u2014especially liberty, opportunity, progress, and individualism, and packaged them into an ideology that supported the property rights of big corporations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard K. Sherwin|title=Popular Culture and Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzkrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA462|year=2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=462|isbn=9781351553728}}</ref>\n\nWriting in 1955, Rossiter suggests that [[Robert A.

''T.&nbsp;sessile'' has polydomous colonies, meaning that one colony has multiple nests. Because of this, ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' is very good at foraging for food when there is great variance in the distribution of resources. Instead of going back to a faraway nest to deliver food, they move workers, queens, and the brood to be closer to the food, so that they can reduce the cost in effort of food transport. This is called 'dispersed central-place foraging'.<ref name=\"dispersed central-place\">{{cite journal |last1=Buczkowski |first1=G. |first2=G. W. |last2=Bennett |title=Dispersed central-place foraging in the polydomous odorous house ant, ''Tapinoma sessile'', as revealed by a protein marker |journal=Insectes Sociaux |date=August 2006 |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=282\u2013290 |doi=10.1007/s00040-006-0870-0}}</ref> It was also found that the half-life of the stay at any one nest was about 12.9&nbsp;days.<ref name=Smallwood1982>{{cite journal |last=Smallwood |first=J. |title=Nest relocations in ants |journal=Insectes Sociaux |year=1982 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=138\u2013147 |doi=10.1007/bf02228747}}</ref>\n\nBuczkowski and Bennett also studied the pattern of food movement within a nest. They labeled [[sucrose]] with Immunoglobin&nbsp;G (IgG) proteins, and then identified them using an [[enzyme]]-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]) to track the movement of food. They found that food was spread through ''[[trophallaxis]]'' (one animal regurgitating food for another). Despite this trophallactic spread of food, the workers kept most of the [[sucrose]]. They also found that some queens received more food than others, suggesting a [[dominance hierarchy]] even between queens. They also found that the nests were located in a system of trails, and that their distribution depended on where food was found and the distance between these patches of food.<ref name=\"dispersed central-place\"/> It was also found that the rate of [[trophallaxis|trophallactic]] feeding depends on the number of ants per nest, and the quality of food available. When the number of donors is kept constant, but the number of total individuals in increased, more individuals test positive for the food marker. This indicates that more individuals are eating, but the amount they eat is less. If the number of donors was doubled, and the size of the overall population increased, the number of individuals receiving food more than doubled, again indicating that the number of individuals fed increased, but that the per capita amount of food consumed decreased.<ref name=\"forager number\">{{cite journal |last1=Buczkowski |first1=G. |first2=G. |last2=Bennett |title=The influence of forager number and colony size on food distribution in the odorous house ant, ''Tapinoma sessile'' |journal=Insectes Sociaux |year=2009 |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=185\u2013192 |doi=10.1007/s00040-009-0011-7}}</ref>\n\nWhen searching for food, primary orientation is when ants are exploring a new terrain without the guidance of odor trails. Secondary orientation is when terrain has been explored, and there are pre-existing odor trails which ants use to orient themselves. When ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' ants are orienting themselves for the first time they often rely on topography. The major types of elements they rely on are bilaterally elevated, bilaterally depressed, unilaterally elevated, and unilaterally depressed. They use these types of surfaces to orient along, and lay the first odor trails, which can then be followed in the future, to the food source, by other ants.<ref name=\"spatial cues\">{{cite journal |last1=Klotz |first1=J.

The colony will overwinter in a single nest, and then during spring and summer when resources are more abundant they will form multiple nests. This allows them to better use food sources, that might be spread out. During the winter they will return again to the same nest location. Seasonal polydomy is rather rare, and only found in 10% of all polydomous species.<ref name=\"seasonal polydomy\">{{cite journal |last1=Buczkowski |first1=G. |first2=G. |last2=Bennett |title=Seasonal polydomy in a polygynous supercolony of the odorous house ant, ''Tapinoma sessile'' |journal=Ecological Entomology |year=2008 |volume=33 |pages=780\u2013788 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01034.x}}</ref> Seasonal polydomy is not found in many ant species, but there are many ant species, including ''T.&nbsp;sessile'', which move within a season: Migration to better forage sites is common.<ref name=Smallwood1982/>\n\nSeasonal activity patterns of the ants were also studied, and corresponding to the seasonal polydomy, it was observed that the ants displayed the most activity between March and September and displayed almost no activity from October to December. Daily activity patterns were also studied. In March ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' foraged during the day, but in April that pattern changed and the ant began to forage during both day and night. During most of the summer, ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' shows low levels of activity throughout the day and night.<ref name=Fellers1989>{{cite journal |last=Fellers |first=Joan H. |title=Daily and seasonal activity in woodland ants |journal=Oecologia |year=1989 |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201376 |doi=10.1007/bf00377199 |bibcode=1989Oecol..78...69F}}</ref>\n\n===Competition with other ants===\n[[Competition (biology)|Competition]] between species is often classified as exploitation or interference. Exploitation involves finding and using limited resources before they can be used by other species, while interference is the act of preventing others from getting resources by more direct force or aggression. When it comes to these behaviors, a species is considered ''dominant'' if it initiates an attack and ''subordinate'' if it avoids other species. In comparison with eight other ant species, the ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' was more subordinate on the dominant to subordinate scale. The ant does not show a large propensity for attack, preferring to use chemical secretions instead of biting.<ref name=Fellers1987>{{cite journal |last=Fellers |first=Joan H. |title=Interference and exploitation in a guild of woodland ants |journal=Ecology |date=October 1987 |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=1466\u20131478 |doi=10.2307/1939230 |jstor=1939230}}</ref>\n\nWhen the ''T.&nbsp;sessile'', a subordinate species, was in the presence of dominant ant species such as ''C.&nbsp;ferrugineus'', ''P.&nbsp;imparis'', ''[[Lasius alienus]]'', and ''F.&nbsp;subsericea'', they reduced the amount of time spent foraging. This was tested with the use of bait, and when the subordinate species, such as ''T.&nbsp;sessile'', encountered a dominant species they would leave the bait. It would then make sense that the subordinate species would forage at a different time than dominant species, so that they could avoid confrontation, but there is sizable overlap in foraging period on a daily and seasonal basis. Because the ''T.&nbsp;sissile'' forages at the same time as dominant species, but avoids other foraging ants, they must have excellent exploitative abilities to survive.<ref name=Fellers1989/>\n\nOne of the [[invasive species]] that ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' has had to contend with is the [[Argentine ant]], ''Linepithema humile''. Studies of its interactions with ''L.&nbsp;humile'' has helped researchers better understand the aggression of ''T.&nbsp;sessile''. ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' ants rarely fight alongside their nest-mates: They only were observed to have fought collectively in six of forty interactions. This often caused ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' to lose altercations with other ant species, such as the ''L.&nbsp;humile'', even when more ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' individuals were present. Whereas other ant species like ''L.&nbsp;humile'' fight together, the ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' do not. The ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' is however more likely to win in one-on-one interactions because they have effective chemical defenses.<ref name=\"sessile v. humile\">{{cite journal |last1=Buczkowski |first1=G. |first2=G.

Indoors they will colonize near heat sources or in [[thermal insulation|insulation]]. In hot and dry situations, nests have been found in house plants and even in the lids of toilets. Outdoors they tend to colonize under rocks and exposed [[soil]]. They appear, however, to form colonies virtually anywhere, in a variety of conditions.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn experiments where ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' workers were confined in an area without a queen, egg-laying (by the workers) was observed, though the workers destroyed any prepupa that emerged from the eggs.<ref name=Smith1928/>\n\nOdorous house ants have been observed collecting honeydew to feed on from [[aphid]]s, [[scale insect]]s, and [[Treehopper|membracid]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThey appear to be more likely to invade homes after rain (which washes away the honeydew they collect).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nOdorous house ants appear to be highly tolerant of other ants, with compound nests consisting of multiple ant species that included ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' having been observed.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==Predators and parasites==\nSome birds and toads will eat odorous house ants on occasion.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nWheeler (1916) mentions ''Bothriomyrmex dimmocki'' as a possible parasite of odorous house ant colonies, suggesting that ''B.&nbsp;dimmocki'' queens invade and replace ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' queens.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n''[[Isobrachium myrmecophilum]]'' (a small wasp) appears to parasitize odorous house ants.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==Pest control==\n''T.&nbsp;sessile'' are not hard to control; they are vulnerable to most ant-killers, which are especially effective when applied as soon as their presence is noticed. If dealt with early, their numbers can be brought under control in just a few days.

''T.&nbsp;sessile'' has polydomous colonies, meaning that one colony has multiple nests. Because of this, ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' is very good at foraging for food when there is great variance in the distribution of resources. Instead of going back to a faraway nest to deliver food, they move workers, queens, and the brood to be closer to the food, so that they can reduce the cost in effort of food transport. This is called 'dispersed central-place foraging'.<ref name=\"dispersed central-place\">{{cite journal |last1=Buczkowski |first1=G. |first2=G. W. |last2=Bennett |title=Dispersed central-place foraging in the polydomous odorous house ant, ''Tapinoma sessile'', as revealed by a protein marker |journal=Insectes Sociaux |date=August 2006 |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=282\u2013290 |doi=10.1007/s00040-006-0870-0}}</ref> It was also found that the half-life of the stay at any one nest was about 12.9&nbsp;days.<ref name=Smallwood1982>{{cite journal |last=Smallwood |first=J. |title=Nest relocations in ants |journal=Insectes Sociaux |year=1982 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=138\u2013147 |doi=10.1007/bf02228747}}</ref>\n\nBuczkowski and Bennett also studied the pattern of food movement within a nest. They labeled [[sucrose]] with Immunoglobin&nbsp;G (IgG) proteins, and then identified them using an [[enzyme]]-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]) to track the movement of food. They found that food was spread through ''[[trophallaxis]]'' (one animal regurgitating food for another). Despite this trophallactic spread of food, the workers kept most of the [[sucrose]]. They also found that some queens received more food than others, suggesting a [[dominance hierarchy]] even between queens. They also found that the nests were located in a system of trails, and that their distribution depended on where food was found and the distance between these patches of food.<ref name=\"dispersed central-place\"/> It was also found that the rate of [[trophallaxis|trophallactic]] feeding depends on the number of ants per nest, and the quality of food available. When the number of donors is kept constant, but the number of total individuals in increased, more individuals test positive for the food marker. This indicates that more individuals are eating, but the amount they eat is less. If the number of donors was doubled, and the size of the overall population increased, the number of individuals receiving food more than doubled, again indicating that the number of individuals fed increased, but that the per capita amount of food consumed decreased.<ref name=\"forager number\">{{cite journal |last1=Buczkowski |first1=G. |first2=G. |last2=Bennett |title=The influence of forager number and colony size on food distribution in the odorous house ant, ''Tapinoma sessile'' |journal=Insectes Sociaux |year=2009 |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=185\u2013192 |doi=10.1007/s00040-009-0011-7}}</ref>\n\nWhen searching for food, primary orientation is when ants are exploring a new terrain without the guidance of odor trails. Secondary orientation is when terrain has been explored, and there are pre-existing odor trails which ants use to orient themselves. When ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' ants are orienting themselves for the first time they often rely on topography. The major types of elements they rely on are bilaterally elevated, bilaterally depressed, unilaterally elevated, and unilaterally depressed. They use these types of surfaces to orient along, and lay the first odor trails, which can then be followed in the future, to the food source, by other ants.<ref name=\"spatial cues\">{{cite journal |last1=Klotz |first1=J.H. |first2=B.L. |last2=Reid |title=The use of spatial cues for structural guideline orientation in ''Tapinoma sessile'' and ''Camponotus pennsylvanicus'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) |journal=Journal of Insect Behavior |date=January 1992 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71\u201382 |doi=10.1007/bf01049159}}</ref>\n\n===Seasonal behaviors===\nIt was also found that this ant species practices seasonal ''polydomy'' (having multiple colony sites) to have access to multiple food sources. The colony will overwinter in a single nest, and then during spring and summer when resources are more abundant they will form multiple nests. This allows them to better use food sources, that might be spread out. During the winter they will return again to the same nest location. Seasonal polydomy is rather rare, and only found in 10% of all polydomous species.<ref name=\"seasonal polydomy\">{{cite journal |last1=Buczkowski |first1=G. |first2=G. |last2=Bennett |title=Seasonal polydomy in a polygynous supercolony of the odorous house ant, ''Tapinoma sessile'' |journal=Ecological Entomology |year=2008 |volume=33 |pages=780\u2013788 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01034.x}}</ref> Seasonal polydomy is not found in many ant species, but there are many ant species, including ''T.&nbsp;sessile'', which move within a season: Migration to better forage sites is common.<ref name=Smallwood1982/>\n\nSeasonal activity patterns of the ants were also studied, and corresponding to the seasonal polydomy, it was observed that the ants displayed the most activity between March and September and displayed almost no activity from October to December. Daily activity patterns were also studied. In March ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' foraged during the day, but in April that pattern changed and the ant began to forage during both day and night. During most of the summer, ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' shows low levels of activity throughout the day and night.<ref name=Fellers1989>{{cite journal |last=Fellers |first=Joan H. |title=Daily and seasonal activity in woodland ants |journal=Oecologia |year=1989 |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201376 |doi=10.1007/bf00377199 |bibcode=1989Oecol..78...69F}}</ref>\n\n===Competition with other ants===\n[[Competition (biology)|Competition]] between species is often classified as exploitation or interference. Exploitation involves finding and using limited resources before they can be used by other species, while interference is the act of preventing others from getting resources by more direct force or aggression. When it comes to these behaviors, a species is considered ''dominant'' if it initiates an attack and ''subordinate'' if it avoids other species. In comparison with eight other ant species, the ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' was more subordinate on the dominant to subordinate scale. The ant does not show a large propensity for attack, preferring to use chemical secretions instead of biting.<ref name=Fellers1987>{{cite journal |last=Fellers |first=Joan H. |title=Interference and exploitation in a guild of woodland ants |journal=Ecology |date=October 1987 |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=1466\u20131478 |doi=10.2307/1939230 |jstor=1939230}}</ref>\n\nWhen the ''T.&nbsp;sessile'', a subordinate species, was in the presence of dominant ant species such as ''C.&nbsp;ferrugineus'', ''P.&nbsp;imparis'', ''[[Lasius alienus]]'', and ''F.&nbsp;subsericea'', they reduced the amount of time spent foraging. This was tested with the use of bait, and when the subordinate species, such as ''T.&nbsp;sessile'', encountered a dominant species they would leave the bait. It would then make sense that the subordinate species would forage at a different time than dominant species, so that they could avoid confrontation, but there is sizable overlap in foraging period on a daily and seasonal basis. Because the ''T.&nbsp;sissile'' forages at the same time as dominant species, but avoids other foraging ants, they must have excellent exploitative abilities to survive.<ref name=Fellers1989/>\n\nOne of the [[invasive species]] that ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' has had to contend with is the [[Argentine ant]], ''Linepithema humile''. Studies of its interactions with ''L.&nbsp;humile'' has helped researchers better understand the aggression of ''T.&nbsp;sessile''. ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' ants rarely fight alongside their nest-mates: They only were observed to have fought collectively in six of forty interactions. This often caused ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' to lose altercations with other ant species, such as the ''L.&nbsp;humile'', even when more ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' individuals were present. Whereas other ant species like ''L.&nbsp;humile'' fight together, the ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' do not. The ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' is however more likely to win in one-on-one interactions because they have effective chemical defenses.<ref name=\"sessile v. humile\">{{cite journal |last1=Buczkowski |first1=G. |first2=G.

Indoors they will colonize near heat sources or in [[thermal insulation|insulation]]. In hot and dry situations, nests have been found in house plants and even in the lids of toilets. Outdoors they tend to colonize under rocks and exposed [[soil]]. They appear, however, to form colonies virtually anywhere, in a variety of conditions.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn experiments where ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' workers were confined in an area without a queen, egg-laying (by the workers) was observed, though the workers destroyed any prepupa that emerged from the eggs.<ref name=Smith1928/>\n\nOdorous house ants have been observed collecting honeydew to feed on from [[aphid]]s, [[scale insect]]s, and [[Treehopper|membracid]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThey appear to be more likely to invade homes after rain (which washes away the honeydew they collect).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nOdorous house ants appear to be highly tolerant of other ants, with compound nests consisting of multiple ant species that included ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' having been observed.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==Predators and parasites==\nSome birds and toads will eat odorous house ants on occasion.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nWheeler (1916) mentions ''Bothriomyrmex dimmocki'' as a possible parasite of odorous house ant colonies, suggesting that ''B.&nbsp;dimmocki'' queens invade and replace ''T.&nbsp;sessile'' queens.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n''[[Isobrachium myrmecophilum]]'' (a small wasp) appears to parasitize odorous house ants.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==Pest control==\n''T.&nbsp;sessile'' are not hard to control; they are vulnerable to most ant-killers, which are especially effective when applied as soon as their presence is noticed.
