Common leopard geckos are related to many different geckos, such as the [[African fat-tailed gecko]] and the [[Coleonyx|banded geckos]]. There are four other species within the Genus ''[[Eublepharis]],'' leopard gecko, one of which was previously included as a subspecies of leopard gecko:\nIn addition, there are five species in the genus.\nCommon leperd gecoes liv in hi plaeses.\n\n==Distribution==\nThe native habitat of the common leopard gecko is the rocky, dry grassland and desert regions of south-Asian [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], north-west [[India]], and some parts of [[Iran]]. Winter temperatures in these areas can be quite low, below {{convert|10|C|F|lk=on}}, forcing the animals underground into semi-hibernation, called ''[[brumation]]'', living on fat reserves. Leopard geckos are [[cathemeral]] reptiles; in the wild they are mostly limited to burrows and shaded areas during the day, becoming more active at dawn and dusk when the temperature is favorable, and are often active quite sporadically in captivity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Courteney-Smith |first=John |date=June 2012 |title=Lighting for a mixed leopard gecko colony |url=http://www.arcadia-reptile.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/032-33_PRK_June12.pdf |journal=Practical Reptile Keeping |pages=32\u201333 |access-date=2 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110958/http://www.arcadia-reptile.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/032-33_PRK_June12.pdf |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These geckos are solitary, and do not usually live with other animals.<ref name=Hamper>{{cite book |last=Hamper|first=R.|title=The Leopard Gecko, ''Eublepharis macularius'', in Captivity |publisher=ECO Herpetological Publishing & Distribution |location=MI |year=2004 |isbn=0971319782}}</ref>\n\n== Diet ==\nIn captivity, common leopard geckos typically feed on [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], dubia roaches, [[mealworm]]s/[[superworm]]s, and other insects. Most leopard geckos prefer hunting food themselves. The majority of captive common leopard geckos refuse to eat dead prey. Dead prey should not be offered, as the nutritional value significantly decreases when dried. [[Cricket (insect)|Crickets]] are the most common food source in captivity, as they can hunt them in their enclosure the way they would in their natural environment, though mealworms, waxworms, and [[Blaptica dubia|dubia roaches]] (and, less frequently, other roach species) are also common. When food is scarce, they can rely on their ability to store excess fat in their tails. Sufficient calcium and vitamin D3 is also very important for their diet. How they obtain it in the wild is still unknown, although they likely receive this from their varied prey of moths, [[spider]]s, ants, and other insects. In captivity, it is impractical, if not impossible, to completely duplicate the diet they would have in the wild, so the most nutritious insects known are offered, usually dusted with a fine calcium powder with added vitamin D3 and [[Gut loading|gut loaded]] with a high calcium diet. Their prey should also be dusted with a reptile multi-vitamin about every fourth feeding. Common leopard geckos will eat until they are full, and live insects that are left uneaten in their tank can become troublesome, particularly crickets, which may bite the reptile's soft skin and cause infection. Leopard geckos' keen olfactory senses and sight allow them to search for food in the wild, and they stalk their prey somewhat like an actual leopard, moving their tail and striking when they are satisfied.<ref name=Hamper/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Jo Jo Le Gecko.jpg|thumb|Close up of a juvenile common leopard gecko.]]\nCommon leopard geckos are larger than many other gecko species. Hatchlings are on average {{convert|7|to|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and weigh about 2 to 5&nbsp;grams. Adult females are about {{convert|18|to|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and weigh about 50 to 70&nbsp;grams, while adult male geckos are about {{convert|20|to|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and weigh about 60 to 80&nbsp;grams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeardeddragon.org/leopard-gecko/leopard-gecko.php|title=Leopard Gecko Information & Facts|work=thebeardeddragon.org}}</ref>\nThose found in the wild typically have more dark, dull, and drab colorations than those kept in captivity as pets. Those in captivity generally have an assortment of skin colors and patterns. The skin of a common leopard gecko is very durable, which provides protection from the rocky grassland terrain of their dry environment. Their dorsal side is covered with small bumps, which gives a rough texture and appearance while their ventral side is thin, transparent, and smooth. Like all reptiles, common leopard geckos shed their skin. In the few days before the shedding, the skin will turn color to a translucent whitish gray.<ref name=gecko_book>{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=R.D.|last2=Bartlett|first2=Patricia|title=Leopard and Fat-Tailed Geckos|year=1999|publisher=Barron's Educational Series, Inc|pages=[https://archive.org/details/leopardfattailed0000bart/page/26 26\u201327]|isbn=0-7641-1119-1|url=https://archive.org/details/leopardfattailed0000bart/page/26}}</ref> Adults shed an average of once a month, while juveniles will sometimes shed twice as much.<ref name=lg_FAQ>{{cite web|title=Leopard Gecko FAQ|url=http://www.reptilecare.com/LeopardFAQ.htm|accessdate= 9 October 2010}}</ref> The gecko will eat its old skin after shedding, revealing a brighter colored one.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/caresheets/leopard-gecko.html|title=Leopard Gecko Care Sheet {{!}} Petco|website=www.petco.com|language=en|access-date=22 August 2017}}</ref> There are two theories of why common leopard geckos do this.

The gecko eats its skin after shedding. Click the file link in the upper right of this description for the full resolution video.]]\n\nCommon leopard geckos are [[ectothermic]]. They absorb warmth and energy during the day as they are sleeping, so they can hunt and digest food at night. In addition, they have short legs, which enable them to be quick and agile while their small nails allow them to climb twigs and rocks. Common leopard geckos have openings on either side of their head as ears. A tympanic membrane covers and protects it. They use their ears to locate their prey.\nHealthy common leopard geckos have thick, fleshy tails; a thin tail is an indication that the gecko may be lacking good health. Although, when in captivity, the tail can be fattened by the feeding of waxworms (wax moth larvae), they are not recommended as a staple diet. They can also be fed \"pinkies\", a one-day-old mouse to fatten up the tail.<ref name=gecko_pets>{{cite book|last1=Tanwall|first1=Martin.|title=Gecko Pets \u2013 Quick Fact Guide|year=2011|publisher=Geckos for Pets|url=http://geckosforpets.com/gecko-pets-quick-fact-guide|accessdate=11 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109215653/http://geckosforpets.com/gecko-pets-quick-fact-guide|archive-date=9 January 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Breeders recommend coating crickets in a nutritional powder before serving them either live or dead. Common leopard geckos' thick tails can regenerate when lost; however, the regenerated tails appear stumpy and never have the same appearance as the original tail.<ref name=Hamper/>\n[[File: Leopard gecko with new tail.JPG|thumb|A common leopard gecko that lost and grew back its tail.|left|200px]]\n\nUnlike many other geckos, but like other Eublepharids, their toes do not have adhesive [[lamella (anatomy)|lamella]]e, so they cannot climb smooth vertical walls.\n\n===Teeth===\nCommon leopard geckos are [[polyphyodont]]s and able to replace each of their 100 teeth every 3 to 4 months.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.devbio.biology.gatech.edu/?page_id=3229 |title=Mechanism of tooth replacement in Leopard geckos |access-date=4 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312094002/http://www.devbio.biology.gatech.edu/?page_id=3229 |archive-date=12 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Next to the full grown tooth there is a small replacement tooth developing from the [[Tooth development|odontogenic]] [[stem cell]] in the [[dental lamina]].<ref>[http://dev.biologists.org/content/137/21/3545.full Identification of putative dental epithelial stem cells in a lizard with lifelong tooth replacement]</ref>\n\n===Tails===\nCommon leopard geckos are not immune to injury, and their tails often take the brunt. In the wild, if a severe injury occurs to a common leopard gecko's tail, it will shrink until the injured part is shed off. For pet geckos, if injury necessitates an amputation of the tail, it will also shrink. If you hold a leopard gecko by its tail then they will drop it to run away.\n\n== Chromatophores and color pigmentation  ==\n[[File:Chromatophores.jpg|thumb|An example of a group of chromatophores.]]\nCommon leopard geckos range in color from a yellow to brownish-orange base with spots covering all or mostly half of the dorsal region of the body. Their color is derived from pigment-containing cells known as [[chromatophore]]s. These cells are responsible for an array of coloration seen in all reptiles, amphibians, birds and some species of insects. Chromatophores come in a variety of types based on the color they correspond to. Chromatophore types include [[Chromatophore|xanthophores]] (responsible for yellow coloration), [[Chromatophore|erythrophores]] (responsible for red coloration), [[Chromatophore|iridophores]] (responsible for [[iridescence]]), [[Chromatophore|leucophores]] (responsible for white coloration), [[Chromatophore|melanophores]] (responsible for black coloration), and [[Chromatophore|cyanophores]] (responsible for blue coloration). The skin of wild common leopard geckos contains xanthophores (yellow) and melanophores (black spots). Designer common leopard geckos may possess erythrophores and leucophores since commercial breeding and [[Selective breeding|artificial selection]] have allowed novel coloration to arise.\n\n==Defense mechanisms==\nCommon leopard geckos have predators such as snakes, foxes, and other large reptiles. Their keen sense of hearing and sight help them escape from them during the night. Along with their exceptional sight and hearing abilities, their skin helps camouflage themselves from their predators. Their sense of taste and smell also helps them with survival. They also stay in underground holes and burrows during the daytime, not only to avoid the heat but to also avoid the risk of getting eaten.<ref name=Hamper/>\n\nCommon leopard geckos also have the ability to voluntarily detach their tails if it is attacked, grabbed by the tail, bitten during copulation, or nipped by another during feeding. This is called caudal autotomy. After autotomy the tail can continue to twitch for as long as 30 minutes, allowing the gecko to escape from its predator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.audubonmagazine.org/web/leopardgecko/ |title=Ta-da! |work=Audubon Magazine |accessdate=15 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713130722/http://archive.audubonmagazine.org/web/leopardgecko/ |archive-date=13 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Higham | first1 = T.

Males have pre-anal pores and hemipenal bulges while females have smaller pores and do not have external bulges.<ref name=Hamper/>\n\nMales can determine the sex of other common leopard geckos by smelling [[pheromones]] on their skin. Males respond to males with aggressive behavior while they demonstrate courtship behavior towards females. Towards other males, the male would raise itself up from the ground, extend his limbs, and arch his back with the swelling of the tongue in aggression. He will then make short dashes and quick, vigorous bites, which frequently lacerate the skin and sometimes severely injure his opponent. Males behave the same way towards females while they are shedding their skin. Before and after the shedding of the skin, the males still express courtship behavior towards the females.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mason, R.T. |author2=Gutzke, W.H.N. |title=Sex Recognition in the Leopard Gecko, ''Eublepharis macularius'' (Sauria: Gekkonidae) Possible Mediation by Skin-Derived Semiochemicals |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=27\u201336 |year=1990 |doi=10.1007/BF01021265 |pmid=24264893 }}</ref>\n\n==Reproduction==\nCommon leopard geckos are also known to have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Research shows that more females can be produced in predominantly cool temperatures (about {{convert|26|\u2013|29|C|F|disp=sqbr}}) and very warm temperatures (about {{convert|34|\u2013|35|C|F|disp=sqbr}}). It was recorded that males can be produced at the intermediate temperatures (about {{convert|31|\u2013|33|C|F|disp=sqbr}}). Any temperature above that is normally not going to produce a newborn, as it will be too hot for the gecko inside the egg. Determination of sex is believed to be set during the first two weeks of incubation. The average amount of time it takes for a newborn to hatch is anywhere between 35 and 89 days, although it is usually closer to the latter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reptilesmagazine.com/Breeding-Lizards/Leopard-Geckos-Tremper/|title=Leopard Gecko Breeding|website=www.reptilesmagazine.com|access-date=6 February 2019}}</ref> Females born in the higher temperatures differed from those who were born in the lower temperatures hormonally and behaviorally.

She can lay about six to eight clutches, which consists of two eggs in each clutch. They will normally lay two eggs approximately 21 to 28 days after mating. After 45 to 60 days, droplets of moisture will appear on the shell and the shell will begin to shrink and partially collapse. These are indications that the eggs will hatch. Baby common leopard geckos will have an \"egg tooth\", a calcareous tip at the end of its snout to help break their egg shell. Their \"egg tooth\" will fall off within one to two days. In addition to this, their skin will usually shed within 24 hours of hatching. The leopard gecko hatchling will not be able to eat until after the first shedding.<ref name=Hamper/>\n\n==Conditions and diseases==\nCaptive born and bred common leopard geckos do not carry any diseases that are transmissible to humans. Salmonella is not an issue because they live in a dry environment and the disease usually occurs in aquatic or semi-aquatic species kept in unsanitary housing conditions.<ref>http://www.reptilia.org/pdfs/habitarium/HabitariumPrograms-GeckoQuickFactSheet.pdf</ref> However, there are several common diseases that common leopard geckos may experience.\n\n* Gastroenteritis, caused by bacterial or protozoan (especially [[Cryptosporidium]]) infection brought on by such things as unsanitary conditions, can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea. As a result, geckos may present with watery and/or bloody stool. Normally the stool is dry and well-formed with a small white portion. It is contagious and can be spread easily. Other symptoms of the disease include weight loss, a skinny tail, undigested cricket masses. If it is not treated, the gecko will stop eating, become dehydrated and scrawny, and possibly die.<ref name=Hamper/> \n* [[Metabolic bone disease]] or MBD is a nutritional deficiency caused by a lack of calcium and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in the diet. Calcium and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> are critical for proper bone formation during development and for proper calcification of eggs for a gravid female. Geckos with MBD will experience symptoms such as weakness, bones becoming spongy, deformities in their limbs and spine, twitching or tremors, and a lack of appetite. Recovering from this disease can be very difficult.<ref name=Hamper/> MBD can usually be easily prevented by dusting their food with calcium powder when feeding and making sure they are gut loaded with nutritious vegetables or commercial food. MBD is also treated by placing a [[UV-B lamps|UVB bulb]] on their enclosure, which helps common leopard geckos to absorb calcium and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.\n* [[Anorexia (symptom)|Anorexia]] in common leopard geckos can be caused by stress, unsanitary conditions, nutritional diseases, or other diseases. Anorexic leopard geckos appear thin, develop an extremely thin tail, become weak and sluggish, stop eating, and usually, die if untreated.<ref name=Hamper/>\n* Dysecdysis is a condition in which a common leopard gecko has problems shedding its skin due to poor nutrition, lack of humidity and moisture, and poor care. Incompletely shed skin will appear as dry patches on various areas of the body such as the head, eyes, limbs, and tail. Leopard geckos with this condition may develop eye problems, have difficulty in walking, and noticeable constricting bands of old skin around their limbs. If the condition is not treated, it could lead to infection.<ref name=Hamper/>\n*[[Pneumonia]] is a severe respiratory tract infection that can be caused by bacteria in the lungs. Common leopard geckos may be susceptible to this if their environment is too cool and humid thus compromising their immune system. Mucus bubbles appear in the nostril area of geckos with pneumonia, and they have difficulty breathing. The problem is usually resolved when the environment temperature rises to about {{convert|82|to|85|F|C}}.<ref name=Hamper/>\n* Sand impactions and [[prolapse]] can occasionally occur. This condition may result if a common leopard gecko ingests sand or other substrates they live on.<ref name=Hamper/>\n\n==Leopard geckos as a pet==\n[[File:Pet Leopard Gecko.PNG|thumb|right|A pet common leopard gecko basking in the body-heat of its owner's arm]]\nCommon leopard geckos are one of the most popular lizard pets.

Common leopard geckos are related to many different geckos, such as the [[African fat-tailed gecko]] and the [[Coleonyx|banded geckos]]. There are four other species within the Genus ''[[Eublepharis]],'' leopard gecko, one of which was previously included as a subspecies of leopard gecko:\nIn addition, there are five species in the genus.\n\n==Distribution==\nThe native habitat of the common leopard gecko is the rocky, dry grassland and desert regions of south-Asian [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], north-west [[India]], and some parts of [[Iran]]. Winter temperatures in these areas can be quite low, below {{convert|10|C|F|lk=on}}, forcing the animals underground into semi-hibernation, called ''[[brumation]]'', living on fat reserves. Leopard geckos are [[cathemeral]] reptiles; in the wild they are mostly limited to burrows and shaded areas during the day, becoming more active at dawn and dusk when the temperature is favorable, and are often active quite sporadically in captivity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Courteney-Smith |first=John |date=June 2012 |title=Lighting for a mixed leopard gecko colony |url=http://www.arcadia-reptile.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/032-33_PRK_June12.pdf |journal=Practical Reptile Keeping |pages=32\u201333 |access-date=2 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110958/http://www.arcadia-reptile.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/032-33_PRK_June12.pdf |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These geckos are solitary, and do not usually live with other animals.<ref name=Hamper>{{cite book |last=Hamper|first=R.|title=The Leopard Gecko, ''Eublepharis macularius'', in Captivity |publisher=ECO Herpetological Publishing & Distribution |location=MI |year=2004 |isbn=0971319782}}</ref>\n\n== Diet ==\nIn captivity, common leopard geckos typically feed on [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], dubia roaches, [[mealworm]]s/[[superworm]]s, and other insects. Most leopard geckos prefer hunting food themselves. The majority of captive common leopard geckos refuse to eat dead prey. Dead prey should not be offered, as the nutritional value significantly decreases when dried. [[Cricket (insect)|Crickets]] are the most common food source in captivity, as they can hunt them in their enclosure the way they would in their natural environment, though mealworms, waxworms, and [[Blaptica dubia|dubia roaches]] (and, less frequently, other roach species) are also common. When food is scarce, they can rely on their ability to store excess fat in their tails. Sufficient calcium and vitamin D3 is also very important for their diet. How they obtain it in the wild is still unknown, although they likely receive this from their varied prey of moths, [[spider]]s, ants, and other insects. In captivity, it is impractical, if not impossible, to completely duplicate the diet they would have in the wild, so the most nutritious insects known are offered, usually dusted with a fine calcium powder with added vitamin D3 and [[Gut loading|gut loaded]] with a high calcium diet. Their prey should also be dusted with a reptile multi-vitamin about every fourth feeding. Common leopard geckos will eat until they are full, and live insects that are left uneaten in their tank can become troublesome, particularly crickets, which may bite the reptile's soft skin and cause infection. Leopard geckos' keen olfactory senses and sight allow them to search for food in the wild, and they stalk their prey somewhat like an actual leopard, moving their tail and striking when they are satisfied.<ref name=Hamper/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Jo Jo Le Gecko.jpg|thumb|Close up of a juvenile common leopard gecko.]]\nCommon leopard geckos are larger than many other gecko species. Hatchlings are on average {{convert|7|to|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and weigh about 2 to 5&nbsp;grams. Adult females are about {{convert|18|to|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and weigh about 50 to 70&nbsp;grams, while adult male geckos are about {{convert|20|to|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and weigh about 60 to 80&nbsp;grams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeardeddragon.org/leopard-gecko/leopard-gecko.php|title=Leopard Gecko Information & Facts|work=thebeardeddragon.org}}</ref>\nThose found in the wild typically have more dark, dull, and drab colorations than those kept in captivity as pets. Those in captivity generally have an assortment of skin colors and patterns. The skin of a common leopard gecko is very durable, which provides protection from the rocky grassland terrain of their dry environment. Their dorsal side is covered with small bumps, which gives a rough texture and appearance while their ventral side is thin, transparent, and smooth. Like all reptiles, common leopard geckos shed their skin. In the few days before the shedding, the skin will turn color to a translucent whitish gray.<ref name=gecko_book>{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=R.D.|last2=Bartlett|first2=Patricia|title=Leopard and Fat-Tailed Geckos|year=1999|publisher=Barron's Educational Series, Inc|pages=[https://archive.org/details/leopardfattailed0000bart/page/26 26\u201327]|isbn=0-7641-1119-1|url=https://archive.org/details/leopardfattailed0000bart/page/26}}</ref> Adults shed an average of once a month, while juveniles will sometimes shed twice as much.<ref name=lg_FAQ>{{cite web|title=Leopard Gecko FAQ|url=http://www.reptilecare.com/LeopardFAQ.htm|accessdate= 9 October 2010}}</ref> The gecko will eat its old skin after shedding, revealing a brighter colored one.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/caresheets/leopard-gecko.html|title=Leopard Gecko Care Sheet {{!}} Petco|website=www.petco.com|language=en|access-date=22 August 2017}}</ref> There are two theories of why common leopard geckos do this.

The gecko eats its skin after shedding. Click the file link in the upper right of this description for the full resolution video.]]\n\nCommon leopard geckos are [[ectothermic]]. They absorb warmth and energy during the day as they are sleeping, so they can hunt and digest food at night. In addition, they have short legs, which enable them to be quick and agile while their small nails allow them to climb twigs and rocks. Common leopard geckos have openings on either side of their head as ears. A tympanic membrane covers and protects it. They use their ears to locate their prey.\nHealthy common leopard geckos have thick, fleshy tails; a thin tail is an indication that the gecko may be lacking good health. Although, when in captivity, the tail can be fattened by the feeding of waxworms (wax moth larvae), they are not recommended as a staple diet. They can also be fed \"pinkies\", a one-day-old mouse to fatten up the tail.<ref name=gecko_pets>{{cite book|last1=Tanwall|first1=Martin.|title=Gecko Pets \u2013 Quick Fact Guide|year=2011|publisher=Geckos for Pets|url=http://geckosforpets.com/gecko-pets-quick-fact-guide|accessdate=11 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109215653/http://geckosforpets.com/gecko-pets-quick-fact-guide|archive-date=9 January 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Breeders recommend coating crickets in a nutritional powder before serving them either live or dead. Common leopard geckos' thick tails can regenerate when lost; however, the regenerated tails appear stumpy and never have the same appearance as the original tail.<ref name=Hamper/>\n[[File: Leopard gecko with new tail.JPG|thumb|A common leopard gecko that lost and grew back its tail.|left|200px]]\n\nUnlike many other geckos, but like other Eublepharids, their toes do not have adhesive [[lamella (anatomy)|lamella]]e, so they cannot climb smooth vertical walls.\n\n===Teeth===\nCommon leopard geckos are [[polyphyodont]]s and able to replace each of their 100 teeth every 3 to 4 months.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.devbio.biology.gatech.edu/?page_id=3229 |title=Mechanism of tooth replacement in Leopard geckos |access-date=4 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312094002/http://www.devbio.biology.gatech.edu/?page_id=3229 |archive-date=12 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Next to the full grown tooth there is a small replacement tooth developing from the [[Tooth development|odontogenic]] [[stem cell]] in the [[dental lamina]].<ref>[http://dev.biologists.org/content/137/21/3545.full Identification of putative dental epithelial stem cells in a lizard with lifelong tooth replacement]</ref>\n\n===Tails===\nCommon leopard geckos are not immune to injury, and their tails often take the brunt. In the wild, if a severe injury occurs to a common leopard gecko's tail, it will shrink until the injured part is shed off. For pet geckos, if injury necessitates an amputation of the tail, it will also shrink. If you hold a leopard gecko by its tail then they will drop it to run away.\n\n== Chromatophores and color pigmentation  ==\n[[File:Chromatophores.jpg|thumb|An example of a group of chromatophores.]]\nCommon leopard geckos range in color from a yellow to brownish-orange base with spots covering all or mostly half of the dorsal region of the body. Their color is derived from pigment-containing cells known as [[chromatophore]]s. These cells are responsible for an array of coloration seen in all reptiles, amphibians, birds and some species of insects. Chromatophores come in a variety of types based on the color they correspond to. Chromatophore types include [[Chromatophore|xanthophores]] (responsible for yellow coloration), [[Chromatophore|erythrophores]] (responsible for red coloration), [[Chromatophore|iridophores]] (responsible for [[iridescence]]), [[Chromatophore|leucophores]] (responsible for white coloration), [[Chromatophore|melanophores]] (responsible for black coloration), and [[Chromatophore|cyanophores]] (responsible for blue coloration). The skin of wild common leopard geckos contains xanthophores (yellow) and melanophores (black spots). Designer common leopard geckos may possess erythrophores and leucophores since commercial breeding and [[Selective breeding|artificial selection]] have allowed novel coloration to arise.\n\n==Defense mechanisms==\nCommon leopard geckos have predators such as snakes, foxes, and other large reptiles. Their keen sense of hearing and sight help them escape from them during the night. Along with their exceptional sight and hearing abilities, their skin helps camouflage themselves from their predators. Their sense of taste and smell also helps them with survival. They also stay in underground holes and burrows during the daytime, not only to avoid the heat but to also avoid the risk of getting eaten.<ref name=Hamper/>\n\nCommon leopard geckos also have the ability to voluntarily detach their tails if it is attacked, grabbed by the tail, bitten during copulation, or nipped by another during feeding. This is called caudal autotomy. After autotomy the tail can continue to twitch for as long as 30 minutes, allowing the gecko to escape from its predator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.audubonmagazine.org/web/leopardgecko/ |title=Ta-da! |work=Audubon Magazine |accessdate=15 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713130722/http://archive.audubonmagazine.org/web/leopardgecko/ |archive-date=13 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Higham | first1 = T.

Males respond to males with aggressive behavior while they demonstrate courtship behavior towards females. Towards other males, the male would raise itself up from the ground, extend his limbs, and arch his back with the swelling of the tongue in aggression. He will then make short dashes and quick, vigorous bites, which frequently lacerate the skin and sometimes severely injure his opponent. Males behave the same way towards females while they are shedding their skin. Before and after the shedding of the skin, the males still express courtship behavior towards the females.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mason, R.T. |author2=Gutzke, W.H.N. |title=Sex Recognition in the Leopard Gecko, ''Eublepharis macularius'' (Sauria: Gekkonidae) Possible Mediation by Skin-Derived Semiochemicals |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=27\u201336 |year=1990 |doi=10.1007/BF01021265 |pmid=24264893 }}</ref>\n\n==Reproduction==\nCommon leopard geckos are also known to have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Research shows that more females can be produced in predominantly cool temperatures (about {{convert|26|\u2013|29|C|F|disp=sqbr}}) and very warm temperatures (about {{convert|34|\u2013|35|C|F|disp=sqbr}}). It was recorded that males can be produced at the intermediate temperatures (about {{convert|31|\u2013|33|C|F|disp=sqbr}}). Any temperature above that is normally not going to produce a newborn, as it will be too hot for the gecko inside the egg. Determination of sex is believed to be set during the first two weeks of incubation. The average amount of time it takes for a newborn to hatch is anywhere between 35 and 89 days, although it is usually closer to the latter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reptilesmagazine.com/Breeding-Lizards/Leopard-Geckos-Tremper/|title=Leopard Gecko Breeding|website=www.reptilesmagazine.com|access-date=6 February 2019}}</ref> Females born in the higher temperatures differed from those who were born in the lower temperatures hormonally and behaviorally.

After 45 to 60 days, droplets of moisture will appear on the shell and the shell will begin to shrink and partially collapse. These are indications that the eggs will hatch. Baby common leopard geckos will have an \"egg tooth\", a calcareous tip at the end of its snout to help break their egg shell. Their \"egg tooth\" will fall off within one to two days. In addition to this, their skin will usually shed within 24 hours of hatching. The leopard gecko hatchling will not be able to eat until after the first shedding.<ref name=Hamper/>\n\n==Conditions and diseases==\nCaptive born and bred common leopard geckos do not carry any diseases that are transmissible to humans. Salmonella is not an issue because they live in a dry environment and the disease usually occurs in aquatic or semi-aquatic species kept in unsanitary housing conditions.<ref>http://www.reptilia.org/pdfs/habitarium/HabitariumPrograms-GeckoQuickFactSheet.pdf</ref> However, there are several common diseases that common leopard geckos may experience.\n\n* Gastroenteritis, caused by bacterial or protozoan (especially [[Cryptosporidium]]) infection brought on by such things as unsanitary conditions, can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea. As a result, geckos may present with watery and/or bloody stool. Normally the stool is dry and well-formed with a small white portion. It is contagious and can be spread easily. Other symptoms of the disease include weight loss, a skinny tail, undigested cricket masses. If it is not treated, the gecko will stop eating, become dehydrated and scrawny, and possibly die.<ref name=Hamper/> \n* [[Metabolic bone disease]] or MBD is a nutritional deficiency caused by a lack of calcium and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in the diet. Calcium and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> are critical for proper bone formation during development and for proper calcification of eggs for a gravid female. Geckos with MBD will experience symptoms such as weakness, bones becoming spongy, deformities in their limbs and spine, twitching or tremors, and a lack of appetite. Recovering from this disease can be very difficult.<ref name=Hamper/> MBD can usually be easily prevented by dusting their food with calcium powder when feeding and making sure they are gut loaded with nutritious vegetables or commercial food. MBD is also treated by placing a [[UV-B lamps|UVB bulb]] on their enclosure, which helps common leopard geckos to absorb calcium and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.\n* [[Anorexia (symptom)|Anorexia]] in common leopard geckos can be caused by stress, unsanitary conditions, nutritional diseases, or other diseases. Anorexic leopard geckos appear thin, develop an extremely thin tail, become weak and sluggish, stop eating, and usually, die if untreated.<ref name=Hamper/>\n* Dysecdysis is a condition in which a common leopard gecko has problems shedding its skin due to poor nutrition, lack of humidity and moisture, and poor care. Incompletely shed skin will appear as dry patches on various areas of the body such as the head, eyes, limbs, and tail. Leopard geckos with this condition may develop eye problems, have difficulty in walking, and noticeable constricting bands of old skin around their limbs. If the condition is not treated, it could lead to infection.<ref name=Hamper/>\n*[[Pneumonia]] is a severe respiratory tract infection that can be caused by bacteria in the lungs. Common leopard geckos may be susceptible to this if their environment is too cool and humid thus compromising their immune system. Mucus bubbles appear in the nostril area of geckos with pneumonia, and they have difficulty breathing. The problem is usually resolved when the environment temperature rises to about {{convert|82|to|85|F|C}}.<ref name=Hamper/>\n* Sand impactions and [[prolapse]] can occasionally occur. This condition may result if a common leopard gecko ingests sand or other substrates they live on.<ref name=Hamper/>\n\n==Leopard geckos as a pet==\n[[File:Pet Leopard Gecko.PNG|thumb|right|A pet common leopard gecko basking in the body-heat of its owner's arm]]\nCommon leopard geckos are one of the most popular lizard pets.

He was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly for the Nationalist Party from 9 Jun 1934 until 13 December 1941. He was an alderman of the City of Launceston, and Mayor of the city in 1933\u20131934, 1946 and 1950.\n\nHe was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], the son of William Hollingsworth and his second wife, Amelia Airey. William, Amelia and their family of eight children (four daughters from William's first marriage, and one son and three daughters of their own) had left Launceston in January 1893 to join the New Australia colony in Paraguay. They sailed from Sydney on the Royal Tar, with the first group of colonists. The New Australia Colony was formally founded in Paraguay on 28 September 1893. Following the development of problems within the group of colonists, William and family left New Australia for Argentina, where he found work on the railways. Son Allen William was born in Buenos Aires on 17 October 1894, and was subsequently baptised there in the Presbyterian Church (William had been an active member of the Congregational Church in Launceston). The family was in very difficult circumstances, and funds were raised in Launceston to pay for their return. They travelled on the ship Mitredale to Newcastle, New South Wales, arriving there on 11 May 1895, and at Launceston on 27 May 1895. Allen was then aged 7 months. William resumed his trade as a blacksmith, and two more daughters were born. But both he and Amelia died young, he in 1902 and she in 1903. They left a family of six children aged 15 and under (the daughters of William's first marriage were all adults by then). Allen was only eight. The extended Airey and Hollingsworth families supported and helped raise the children. The Aireys belonged to the Methodist Church, and Allen and his sisters attended Sunday School. When he reached 14 years, Allen was apprenticed as a French polisher, a trade he followed all his working life. When war broke out in 1914, he enlisted in the AIF on 8 January 1915, and was posted to the 15th Battalion. He was with the 15th when they landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, and served there throughout the campaign. After the evacuation from Gallipoli, he was transferred to the 4th Division Signals, in which he served for the rest of the war. He reached the rank of Lance-Corporal. In 1918, he was selected for early return to Australia, and arrived home on the Burmah on 19 January 1919. He resumed his trade as a French polisher in Launceston. On 29 June 1921, at West Pine, near Penguin on the North West Coast of Tasmania, he married Elizabeth Owens, the sister of one of his fellow soldiers, who had been killed at Gallipoli. The couple lived in Launceston, in Invermay, first at 11 Waugh St, and then from the 1930s in a beautiful Federation house in Mayne St, demolished when the Northern Outlet was constructed. In the 1920s, they had two sons, Owen and Leslie John, and a daughter, Margaret, who did not survive infancy. They were active in the Invermay Methodist Church, with Allen teaching Sunday School there. His sister Millie did the same at the Margaret St Methodist Church. In 1928, he stood for election as an alderman on the Launceston City Council, advertising his role as \"the only returned soldier candidate\". He narrowly missed election, coming in 5th for 4 positions. He was also involved with the Invermay Progress Association, especially in its campaigning for the establishment of a recreation reserve on the Mowbray Swamp.

He was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly for the Nationalist Party from 9 Jun 1934 until 13 December 1941. He was an alderman of the City of Launceston, and Mayor of the city in 1933-1934, 1946 and 1950.\n\nHe was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], the son of William Hollingsworth and his second wife, Amelia Airey. William, Amelia and their family of eight children (four daughters from William's first marriage, and one son and three daughters of their own) had left Launceston in January 1893 to join the New Australia colony in Paraguay. They sailed from Sydney on the Royal Tar, with the first group of colonists. The New Australia Colony was formally founded in Paraguay on 28 September 1893. Following the development of problems within the group of colonists, William and family left New Australia for Argentina, where he found work on the railways. Son Allen William was born in Buenos Aires on 17 October 1894, and was subsequently baptised there in the Presbyterian Church (William had been an active member of the Congregational Church in Launceston). The family was in very difficult circumstances, and funds were raised in Launceston to pay for their return. They travelled on the ship Mitredale to Newcastle, New South Wales, arriving there on 11 May 1895, and at Launceston on 27 May 1895. Allen was then aged 7 months. William resumed his trade as a blacksmith, and two more daughters were born. But both he and Amelia died young, he in 1902 and she in 1903. They left a family of six children aged 15 and under (the daughters of William's first marriage were all adults by then). Allen was only eight. The extended Airey and Hollingsworth families supported and helped raise the children. The Aireys belonged to the Methodist Church, and Allen and his sisters attended Sunday School.

It is one of the leading manufacturers of injection systems for large diesel engines worldwide. It developed and produced the first common-rail system for large diesel engines. Woodward L'Orange is a supplier to engine builders and has been part of [[Woodward, Inc.|Woodward]] since 2018. Previously the L'Orange GmbH belonged to the Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG. <ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/04/09/rolls-royce-sells-lorange-business-woodward-610m-deal/</ref>.\n\n==History==\nOn 9 September 1933, Rudolf L'Orange, son of [[Prosper L'Orange]], together with his brother Harro, founded the ''Gebr\u00fcder L'Orange Motorzubeh\u00f6r GmbH'' (L'Orange Brothers Engine Accessories Company) in Stuttgart. Initially, they produced stamps, cylinders, needles and needle guides for injection pumps for aircraft and marine engines. His father had sold his inventions and manufacturing rights to the [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Robert Bosch AG]], and this led to the foundation of the company.\n\nIn [[Hamburg]], L'Orange founded the ''Norddeutsche L\u2019Orange GmbH Hamburg'' subsidiary (North German L'Orange Company Hamburg) to be able to supply the navy with its products. With the advent of new drive technologies,  Rudolf L'Orange developed and invented new injection systems, such as the \u201czweimengend\u00fcse\u201d for continuous atomization. Due to the positive response to his products, he was able to open three further operations: in [[Dresden]], in [[Berlin-Niedersch\u00f6neweide|Niedersch\u00f6neweide]] near [[Berlin]], and in Neudamm in Pomerania. To escape destruction during the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Berlin operation was moved to [[Glatten]] in the Black Forest. \n\nIn 1947, once the war ended, a new start for the young company was planned. Together with Karl Maybach, who used the L'Orange direct current system for its high-speed, lightweight diesel engines for locomotives and ships, the company was successful once again. Around 1950, L'Orange, together with Maybach, developed the pump-nozzle system that soon became indispensable for large diesel engines thanks to the many benefits it delivered. This invention brought L'Orange so much success, that further locations were opened in [[Munich]], Hamburg and Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen. \n\nAfter the death of Rudolf L'Orange in 1958, his widow continued the business until 1978.\n \nIn 1979, ITT Automotiv took over all the shares of the L'Orange family, then selling them to [[MTU_Aero_Engines|MTU M\u00fcnchen]] in 1985. Soon thereafter, in 1989, the second production plant in [[Wolfratshausen]] was inaugurated. In 1995, L'Orange was sold to [[MTU Friedrichshafen]] and then in 2006, incorporated into the Tognum Group (Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG since 2014). In 2009, the L'Orange Fuel Injection Trading (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. subsidiary was founded in China. In 2014, L\u2019Orange founded its third production location in Ningbo (China), which was also the first plant to be established outside Germany. In April 2018 Rolls-Royce Power Systems sold the company to its competitor Woodward in the USA. <ref>[http://www.lorange.com/lorange/historie/index.de.html ''Seit \u00fcber 80 Jahren ist L\u2019Orange in der Einspritztechnologie an der Spitze.''] abgerufen am 27.

Previously the L'Orange GmbH belonged to the Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG. <ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/04/09/rolls-royce-sells-lorange-business-woodward-610m-deal/</ref>.\n\n==History==\nOn 9 September 1933, Rudolf L'Orange, son of [[Prosper L'Orange]], together with his brother Harro, founded the ''Gebr\u00fcder L'Orange Motorzubeh\u00f6r GmbH'' (L'Orange Brothers Engine Accessories Company) in Stuttgart. Initially, they produced stamps, cylinders, needles and needle guides for injection pumps for aircraft and marine engines. His father had sold his inventions and manufacturing rights to the [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Robert Bosch AG]], and this led to the foundation of the company.\n\nIn [[Hamburg]], L'Orange founded the ''Norddeutsche L\u2019Orange GmbH Hamburg'' subsidiary (North German L'Orange Company Hamburg) to be able to supply the navy with its products. With the advent of new drive technologies,  Rudolf L'Orange developed and invented new injection systems, such as the \u201czweimengend\u00fcse\u201d for continuous atomization. Due to the positive response to his products, he was able to open three further operations: in [[Dresden]], in [[Berlin-Niedersch\u00f6neweide|Niedersch\u00f6neweide]] near [[Berlin]], and in Neudamm in Pomerania. To escape destruction during the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Berlin operation was moved to [[Glatten]] in the Black Forest. \n\nIn 1947, once the war ended, a new start for the young company was planned. Together with Karl Maybach, who used the L'Orange direct current system for its high-speed, lightweight diesel engines for locomotives and ships, the company was successful once again. Around 1950, L'Orange, together with Maybach, developed the pump-nozzle system that soon became indispensable for large diesel engines thanks to the many benefits it delivered. This invention brought L'Orange so much success, that further locations were opened in [[Munich]], Hamburg and Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen. \n\nAfter the death of Rudolf L'Orange in 1958, his widow continued the business until 1978.\n \nIn 1979, ITT Automotiv took over all the shares of the L'Orange family, then selling them to [[MTU_Aero_Engines|MTU M\u00fcnchen]] in 1985. Soon thereafter, in 1989, the second production plant in [[Wolfratshausen]] was inaugurated. In 1995, L'Orange was sold to [[MTU Friedrichshafen]] and then in 2006, incorporated into the Tognum Group (Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG since 2014). In 2009, the L'Orange Fuel Injection Trading (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. subsidiary was founded in China. In 2014, L\u2019Orange founded its third production location in Ningbo (China), which was also the first plant to be established outside Germany. In April 2018 Rolls-Royce Power Systems sold the company to its competitor Woodward in the USA. <ref>[http://www.lorange.com/lorange/historie/index.de.html ''Seit \u00fcber 80 Jahren ist L\u2019Orange in der Einspritztechnologie an der Spitze.''] abgerufen am 27.

Some lyrics refer to the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] chief [[Skenandoa|Shenandoah]] and a canoe-going trader who wants to marry his daughter. By the mid 1800s versions of the song had become a [[sea shanty]] heard or sung by sailors in various parts of the world.\n\nThe song is number 324 in the [[Roud Folk Song Index]].\n\n== History ==\nUntil the 19th century only adventurers who sought their fortunes as trappers and traders of beaver fur ventured as far west as the [[Missouri River]]. Most of these Canadian and US \"[[voyageurs]]\" in the [[North American fur trade|fur trade era]] were loners who became friendly with, and sometimes married, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Some lyrics of this song heard by and before 1860 tell the story of a trader who fell in love with the daughter of the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] [[Iroquois]] pine tree chief [[Skenandoa|Shenandoah]] (1710\u20131816), who lived in the central New York state town of [[Oneida Castle]]. He was a co-founder of the Oneida Academy, which became [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]], and is buried on the campus grounds.\n\n{{Quote box\n |bgcolor = Cornsilk\n |quote  = [\"Shenandoah\"] probably came from the American or Canadian ''voyageurs'', who were great singers .... In the early days of America, rivers and canals were the chief trade and passenger routes, and boatmen were an important class. Shenandoah was a celebrated Indian chief in American history, and several towns in the States are named after him.

L. ANDREWES. \"'Shenandoah'.\" The Times [London, England] 19 September 1930, p. 6. \"This chantey is obviously of American origin.... 'Shenandoah' was more a wool and cotton chantey than a capstan chantey.  I have many times heard it sung down the hold on the wool screws by the Sydney waterside workers ... and many were full-blood negroes, who undoubtedly brought these chanteys off the cotton ships.... With regard to the words, these vary according to the taste of the chantey man in the first and third line of each verse, there being no effort called for on these two lines, but the second and fourth lines were always the same, these being the rhythm lines on which the weight was used. When I was in the wool trade in the eighties, in both ''[[Punjaub (ship)|The Tweed]]'' and ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' this chantey was daily used on the wool screws.\"</ref>\n\n== Lyrics ==\nSince \"Shenandoah\" was a riverman's and then sailor's song and went through numerous changes and versions over the years and centuries, there are no set lyrics. Modern lyrics are usually some variation of the following:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n:Oh Shenandoah,\n:I long to see you,\n:And hear your rolling river.\n:Oh Shenandoah,\n:I long to see you,\n:Way, we\u2019re bound a way\n:Across the wide Missouri.\n{{col-break}}\n:Oh Shenandoah,\n:I love your daughter,\n:And hear your rolling river.\n:For her I'd cross\n:Your roaming waters,\n:Way, we\u2019re bound a way\n:Across the wide Missouri.\n{{col-break}}\n:'Tis seven years\n:since last I've seen you,\n:And hear your rolling river.\n:'Tis seven years\n:since last I've seen you,\n:Way, we\u2019re bound a way\n:Across the wide Missouri.\n{{col-break}}\n:Oh Shenandoah,\n:I long to hear you,\n:And hear your rolling river.\n:Oh Shenandoah,\n:I long to hear you,\n:Way, we\u2019re bound a way\n:Across the wide Missouri.\n{{col-break}}\n:Oh Shenandoah,\n:I long to hear you,\n:Far away, you rolling river.\n:Oh Shenandoah,\n:Just to be near you,\n:Far away, far away.\n:Across the wide Missouri.\n{{col-end}}\n\n=== Earlier versions ===\nLyrics from prior to 1860, as given in ''Sea Songs and Shanties, collected by W.B.

Brookington added his informant Laidlaw had later heard it sung \"almost word for word as the sailor of Harland sang it\" in 1926 at Monterey Presidio by a captain of the 9th U.S. Cavalry, and that this regiment, though officered by whites, was made up largely of black troopers. The letter-writer therefore speculated the song was originally a negro spiritual.</ref>\n{{col-end}}\n\nLyrics to \"Oh Shenandoah\" as sung by [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] (1959):\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n:Oh Shenandoah, I hear you calling,\n:Hi-o, you rolling river.\n:Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you,\n:Hi-o, I'm bound away.\n:'Cross the wide, Mis-sou-ri.\n{{col-break}}\n:Mis-sou-ri, She's a mighty river,\n:Hi-o, you rolling river.\n:When she rolls down, her topsails shiver,\n:Hi-o, I'm bound away,\n:'Cross the wide, Mis-sou-ri.\n{{col-break}}\n:Farewell my dearest, I'm bound to leave you,\n:Hi-o, you rolling river.\n:Oh Shenandoah, I'll not deceive you,\n:Hi-o, I'm bound away.\n:'Cross the wide Mis-sou-ri.\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Modern usage ==\nThe song is popular in local organizations such as [[Shenandoah University]], [[Southern Virginia University]], [[Washington and Lee University]], and the [[Virginia Military Institute]].\n\nIn 2006 \"Shenandoah\" was proposed as the \"interim state song\" for [[Virginia]], with updated lyrics.<ref name= roanoke>{{cite news|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/wb/xp-54991|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120911081748/http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/wb/xp-54991|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 11, 2012|title=Proposed state song doesn't bring down the House|first=Michael|last=Sluss|date=March 2, 2006|work=The Roanoke Times}}</ref> The proposal was contentious because the standard folksong refers to the Missouri River, and in most versions of the song the name \"Shenandoah\" refers to an Indian chief, not the [[Shenandoah Valley]] or [[Shenandoah River]] which lie almost entirely in Virginia.<ref name= roanoke/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/01/21/378905664/virginia-searches-for-a-new-state-song|title=Virginia Searches For A New State Song|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-10-23}}</ref> In 2015, \"[[Our Great Virginia]]\", which uses the melody of \"Shenandoah\" was designated by the Virginia Legislature as the official traditional state song of Virginia.\n\nIt features in the soundtrack of the 1965 movie, ''[[Shenandoah (film)|Shenandoah]],'' starring Jimmy Stewart.

Some lyrics refer to the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] chief [[Skenandoa|Shenandoah]] and a canoe-going trader who wants to marry his daughter. By the mid 1800s versions of the song had become a [[sea shanty]] heard or sung by sailors in various parts of the world.\n\nThe song is number 324 in the [[Roud Folk Song Index]].\n\n== History ==\nUntil the 19th century only adventurers who sought their fortunes as trappers and traders of beaver fur ventured as far west as the [[Missouri River]]. Most of these Canadian and US \"[[voyageurs]]\" in the [[North American fur trade|fur trade era]] were loners who became friendly with, and sometimes married, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Some lyrics of this song heard by and before 1860 tell the story of a trader who fell in love with the daughter of the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] [[Iroquois]] pine tree chief [[Skenandoa|Shenandoah]] (1710\u20131816), who lived in the central New York state town of [[Oneida Castle]]. He was a co-founder of the Oneida Academy, which became [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]], and is buried on the campus grounds.\n\n{{Quote box\n |bgcolor = Cornsilk\n |quote  = [\"Shenandoah\"] probably came from the American or Canadian ''voyageurs'', who were great singers ....

L. ANDREWES. \"'Shenandoah'.\" The Times [London, England] 19 September 1930, p. 6. \"This chantey is obviously of American origin.... 'Shenandoah' was more a wool and cotton chantey than a capstan chantey.  I have many times heard it sung down the hold on the wool screws by the Sydney waterside workers ... and many were full-blood negroes, who undoubtedly brought these chanteys off the cotton ships.... With regard to the words, these vary according to the taste of the chantey man in the first and third line of each verse, there being no effort called for on these two lines, but the second and fourth lines were always the same, these being the rhythm lines on which the weight was used. When I was in the wool trade in the eighties, in both ''[[Punjaub (ship)|The Tweed]]'' and ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' this chantey was daily used on the wool screws.\"</ref>\n\n== Lyrics ==\nSince \"Shenandoah\" was a riverman's and then sailor's song and went through numerous changes and versions over the years and centuries, there are no set lyrics.

Brookington added his informant Laidlaw had later heard it sung \"almost word for word as the sailor of Harland sang it\" in 1926 at Monterey Presidio by a captain of the 9th U.S. Cavalry, and that this regiment, though officered by whites, was made up largely of black troopers.

{"title_page": "Interrogation", "text_new": "{{other uses}}\n{{refimprove|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Police interrogation room.jpg|thumb|A police interrogation room in [[Switzerland]].]]\n'''Interrogation''' (also called '''questioning''') is [[interview]]ing as commonly employed by [[law enforcement officers]], [[military personnel]], and [[intelligence agencies]] with the goal of eliciting useful information. Interrogation may involve a diverse array of techniques, ranging from developing a rapport with the subject to [[torture]].\n\n==Techniques==\n{{See also|Enhanced interrogation techniques}}\n[[File:Alessandro Magnasco - Interrogations in Jail - WGA13849.jpg|thumb|''Interrogations in Jail'', by [[Alessandro Magnasco]], c. 1710]]\n\nThere are multiple techniques employed in interrogation including deception, torture, increasing suggestibility, and the use of mind-altering drugs.\n\n===Suggestibility===\nA person's [[suggestibility]] is how willing they are to accept and act on suggestions by others. Interrogators seek to increase a subject's suggestibility. Methods used to increase suggestibility may include moderate [[Sleep deprivation#Torture|sleep deprivation]], exposure to constant [[white noise]], and using [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]]ergic drugs such as [[sodium amytal]] or [[sodium thiopental]].  Attempting to increase a subject's suggestibility through these methods may violate local and national laws concerning the treatment of detainees, and in some areas may be considered torture.  Sleep deprivation, exposure to white noise, and the use of drugs may greatly inhibit a detainee's ability to provide truthful and accurate information.\n\n===Deception===\n[[Deception]] can form an important part of effective interrogation. In the [[United States]], there is no law or regulation that forbids the interrogator from lying about the strength of their case, from making misleading statements or from implying that the interviewee has already been implicated in the crime by someone else. See case law on trickery and deception (''[[Frazier v. Cupp]]'').<ref>{{cite web |author=J. D. Obenberger |date=October 1998 |url=http://my.execpc.com/~xxxlaw/GP03-98.htm |title=Police Deception: The Law and the Skin Trade in the Windy City}}</ref>\n\nAs noted above, traditionally the issue of deception is considered from the perspective of the interrogator engaging in deception towards the individual being interrogated.  Recently, work completed regarding effective interview methods used to gather information from individuals who score in the medium to high range on measures of psychopathology and are engaged in deception directed towards the interrogator have appeared in the literature.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perri |first1= Frank S. |last2= Lichtenwald |first2= Terrance G. |year=2008 |url=http://www.all-about-psychology.com/support-files/exposing_fraud_detection_homicide.pdf |title=The Arrogant Chameleons: Exposing Fraud Detection Homicide |work= Forensic Examiner |pages= 26\u201333 |publisher=All-about-psychology.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perri |first1= Frank S. |last2=Lichtenwald |first2= Terrance G. |year=2010 |url=http://www.all-about-forensic-psychology.com/support-files/female-psychopathic-killers.pdf |title=The Last Frontier: Myths & The Female Psychopathic Killer |work= Forensic Examiner |pages= 19:2, 50\u201367 |publisher=All-about-forensic-psychology.com}}</ref>\nThe importance of allowing the psychopathic interviewee to tell one lie after another and not confront until all of the lies have been presented is essential when the goal is to use the interview to expose the improbable statements made during the interview in future court proceedings.\n\n===Verbal and non-verbal cues===\n\nThe major aim of this technique is to investigate to what extent verbal and non-verbal features of liars\u2019 and truth-tellers\u2019 behaviour change during the course of repeated interrogations. It has shown that liars display significantly fewer smiles, self-manipulations, pauses, and less gaze aversion than truth-tellers. According to Granhag & Str\u00f6mwall, there are three approaches to non-verbal deceptive behavior. The first is the emotional approach, which suggests that liars will alter their behaviors based on their own emotional feelings.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite paper |last1=Granhag |first1=P\u00e4r Anders |last2= Str\u00f6mwall |first2= Lief A. |year=2002 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227752082 |title=Repeated interrogations: Verbal and non-verbal cues to deception |publisher=Research Gate}}</ref> For example, if a subject is lying and they begin to experience guilt, they will shift their gaze. The second approach is the cognitive approach, which suggests that lying requires more thought than telling the truth, which in turn, may result in a liar making more errors in speech.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Lastly, the attempted control approach suggests a subject who is lying will attempt to be seemingly normal or honest, and will try to adjust their behaviors to make themselves believable.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Pride-and-ego (up or down)===\n{{Main|Pride-and-ego down}}\nThere are two pride-and-ego techniques used in interrogation. One is the pride-and-ego up approach, while the other is the pride-and-ego down approach. The pride-and-ego up approach involves seeking information from a subject through the use of constant flattery and compliments. As the subject is being continuously praised, the interrogator hopes that through speaking of the subject in a positive light, he or she will provide the necessary information. \nOn the contrary, the [[Pride-and-ego down|pride-and-ego-down]] approach occurs when the interrogator demeans and insults the subject, with the intent of having the subject provide information. The interrogator will verbally/emotionally abuse the subject, hoping that, eventually, the subject will attempt to salvage his or her sense of pride or self-worth.\n\n===Mind-altering drugs===\nThe use of drugs in interrogation is both ineffective and illegal. The Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] as resolution 43/173 of 9 December 1988)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/43/a43r173.htm|title=A/RES/43/173. Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment|author=|date=|website=www.un.org}}</ref> forbids \"methods of interrogation which impair the capacity of decision of judgment.\" Furthermore, the [[World Medical Association]] and [[American Medical Association]], for example, both forbid participation by physicians in interrogations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/physician-participation-interrogation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225050920/https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/physician-participation-interrogation|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-12-25|title=Physician participation in interrogation|last=American Medical Association}}</ref>\n\nIn the past, various mind-altering substances have been tried as \"[[truth serum]]s\", including [[sodium pentothal]], [[Sodium Amytal|sodium amytal]], and [[scopolamine]]. In the context of [[Project MKUltra]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] conducted trials on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] as a potential truth serum, beginning in the 1950s.\n\n===Torture===\n{{Main|Torture|Third degree (interrogation)}}\n{{POV section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Hanging.gif|thumb|upright|[[Half-hanging]] of suspected [[United Irishmen]] by government troops in 1798]]\n\nThe history of the state use of [[torture]] in interrogations extends over more than 2,000 years in Europe\u2014though it was recognized early on as the Roman imperial jurist Ulpian in the third century AD cautioned, that information extracted under duress was deceptive and untrustworthy.<ref>{{cite book  | last =McCoy  | first =Alfred  | authorlink =  | title =A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror  | publisher =Henry Holt & Co.  | series =  | volume =  | edition =  | year =2007  | location =  | pages =[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780805082487/page/16 16\u201317]  | language =  | url =https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780805082487/page/16  | doi =  | id =  | isbn =978-0-8050-8248-7  | url-access =registration  }}</ref> There is \"no means of obtaining the truth\" from those who have the strength to resist says Ulpian, while others unable to withstand the pain \"will tell any lie rather than suffer it.\"<ref name=\"McCoy, a Question of Torture 2007 16\">{{Harv|McCoy, a Question of Torture|2007|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThe use of torture as an investigative technique waned with the rise of Christianity since it was considered \"antithetical to Christ's teachings,\" and in 866 Pope Nicholas I banned the practice.<ref name=\"McCoy, a Question of Torture 2007 16\"/>  But after the 13th century many European states such as Germany, France, Portugal, Italy, and Spain began to return to physical abuse for religious [[inquisition]], and for secular investigations.<ref name=\"McCoy, a Question of Torture 2007 16\"/> By the 18th century the spreading influence of the Enlightenment led European nations to abandon officially state-sanctioned interrogation by torture.

To this end, a variety of tactics are employed.<ref>{{cite book |title=Police Interrogation and American Justice |date=June 2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=119 |isbn=9780674035317}}</ref>\n\n=== Tactics ===\nPolice interrogations in the United States involve the suspect voluntarily giving information when being questioned. Police use several different tactics in order for the suspect to elicit information voluntarily. Interrogations are often presented by the cops in a way where the person in question is not presented as a suspect. Investigators often state that they need to ask a couple questions in order to get more information about the crime committed. Police like to refer to this process as an \"interview\" rather than an interrogation as this allows the suspect to feel less threatened. The suspect is asked to come into the police station so that the suspect is not around anyone or anything familiar. Getting the suspect on police territory and in a new environment allows for the police to have better control of the situation, including preventing the suspect from resisting the interrogation operations. Once suspects are in the interrogation room, police often begin by asking background information questions and engaging in small talk. This allows for the suspect to feel less threatened which will elicit voluntary responses to the questions. The interrogation continues and questions about the crime are asked.\n\n=== Reid technique ===\nThe Reid technique is a technique widely used by law enforcement in the U.S. for interrogation purposes. It involves steps to obtaining a confession as well as methods for detecting signs of deception in the suspect's body language. The technique has been criticized for being difficult to apply across cultures and eliciting false confessions from innocent people.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kassin |first1=Saul |last2=Fong |first2=Christina |title='I'm Innocent!': Effects of Training on Judgments of Truth and Deception in the Interrogation room |journal=Law and Human Behavior |volume=23 |number=5 |year=1999 |pages=499\u2013516 |doi=10.1023/a:1022330011811}}</ref>\n\n=== Maximization and minimization === \nPolice interrogation tactics can be classified into two general categories: maximization and minimization. Maximization techniques involve eliciting information from the suspect by emphasizing potential consequences for refusing to admit guilt, presenting false evidence, or accusing the suspect of having committed the act. Minimization techniques entail minimizing the suspect's hand in the crime and the associated consequences of his or her actions for the purposes of eliciting a confession.\n\n==== Linguistic techniques for maximization ====\nAs a maximization tactic inspired by the Reid technique, presupposition-bearing questions (PBQs) are questions that interrogators may use to indirectly gain from suspects confirmation of incriminating information. This is because in answering a PBQ one may inadvertently accept and confirm backgrounded information in the question. For example, during the police interrogation of 14-year-old Lorenzo Montoya in the investigation of the murder of 29-year-old Emily Johnson in Denver in January 2000, police used PBQs in efforts to obtain a false confession.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gaines |first1=Philip |title=Presupposition as investigator certainty in a police interrogation: The case of Lorenzo Montoya's false confession |journal=Discourse & Society |date=July 1, 2018 |volume=29 |issue=4 |page=399\u2013419|doi=10.1177/0957926518754417 |url=https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/15136 }}.</ref> Police transcripts showed that one interrogator had asked \"It [going inside the car and coming to the murder scene] was a mistake though, wasn't it? Were you high at the time?\", with which Lorenzo replied \"No!\". This shows that Lorenzo was either answering the first question, which bears an incriminating presupposition, or answering the second question and thus refusing he was high at the time. However, if Lorenzo's intent was to answer the first question, which directly asks if coming to the murder scene was a mistake, neither a \"no\" or \"yes\" could target the presupposition that Lorenzo was present at the crime scene. Because this piece of information is tucked into the background, either a 'yes' or a 'no' answer would necessitate accepting the proposition that Lorenzo was present at the crime scene.\n\n===Good cop/bad cop===\n{{Main|Good cop/bad cop}}\n[[File:Omar Khadr pulling his hair in frustration during an interrogation by Canadian officials.jpg|thumb|[[Omar Khadr]] pulling his hair in frustration during an interrogation by Canadian officials, February 2003]]\n\nA common technique that is used in interrogation is Good Cop/Bad Cop. With this technique, two officers will pretend to take opposing sides while interacting with a subject. While the \u2018bad cop\u2019 is seemingly against the subject, the 'good cop' seems to take the side of the subject, sympathizing with and even defending the subject. The purpose of this technique is to have the subject think that he or she can confide in the \u2018good cop,\u2019 thus providing him or her with information that may help further the case.\n\n=== Fifth Amendment protections for suspects under interrogation ===\n{{Main|Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution}}\nAlthough police can use linguistic strategies to elicit confessions from suspects, they do not have unconditional power to intimidate suspects into providing information. A number of protections exist for suspects under interrogation, including the Fifth Amendment, Miranda Rights, and other legal mandates.\n\n==== The Fifth Amendment ====\nThe Fifth Amendment, which states that one cannot be made to be \"a witness against himself\", prohibits law enforcement from forcing suspects to offer self-incriminating evidence.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Solan |first1=Lawrence |last2=Tiersma |first2=Peter Meijes |title=Speaking of crime the language of criminal justice |date=2005 |publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press}}</ref> For example, upon being asked by the police if one was present at the scene of a crime, one can refuse to respond. However, law enforcement can require that one provide demonstrative evidence through a blood or DNA sample. \n\n==== The right to counsel ====\nFollowing the [[Escobedo v. Illinois]] ruling, the Supreme Court mandates that a suspect under police interrogation may refuse to respond to questioning until a lawyer is present, which is called invoking one's right to seek counsel. The Supreme Court further elaborated on this mandate following the decision of [[Edwards v. Arizona]] by stating that police cannot continue interrogation once the suspect invokes his or her right to counsel, or until he or she voluntarily agrees to continue questioning.\n\n==== Miranda rights ====\n{{Main|Miranda warning}}\nAs a result of the [[Miranda v. Arizona]] ruling, police are required to read aloud to suspects under interrogation their Miranda Rights afforded to them by the Fifth Amendment, such as the right to remain silent and the right to seek counsel. If the police fail to administer the Miranda rights, all statements under interrogation are prohibited from being used as evidence in court proceedings.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Candela |first1=Kimberlee |editor-first=William J. |editor-last=Chambliss |title=Courts, Law, and Justice |chapter=Miranda Rights |date=June 24, 2011 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |isbn=9781412978576}}</ref>\n\n==Around the world==\n[[File:Japanese police interrogation room - movie set - October 2014.jpg|thumb|Film set of a [[Japan]]ese police interrogation room.]]\n\n===United Kingdom===\nBritish legislation that applies to interrogation activities include:\n* [[Human Rights Act 1998]]\n* [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]]\n* [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]]\n* [[Terrorism Act 2006]]\n\nAs well as legislation, statutory law and regulatory law, various legal precedents called '[[case law]]' also impact interrogation techniques and procedures. One of the first attempts by British Courts to guide and set standards for police officers interrogating suspects was the declaration of the '[[Judges' Rules]]' in 1912 by the judges of the King's Bench Division in England. These rules, although not law, still have weight in the United Kingdom and Canada.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Criminal Investigation: In Search of the Truth|last=Van Allen|first=Bill|publisher=Pearson Canada|year=2012|isbn=978-0-13-800011-0|location=Canada|pages=110}}</ref>  \n\nAll police officers are trained in interview techniques during basic training, further training in detailed interviewing or specialist interviewing is received in specialist or advanced courses, such as [[Criminal Investigation Department|criminal investigation]], fraud investigation or child protection.\n\nMilitary interrogation takes two forms, Tactical Questioning or Detailed Interviewing.  Tactical Questioning is the initial screening of detainees, Detailed Interviewing is the more advanced questioning of subjects.\n\nTraining for all personnel engaged in both TQ and DI takes place at the [[Joint Intelligence Training Group]], Chicksands.\n\nBritish military personnel were found to have misused a number of techniques during the detention of suspects in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Mumford|first=Andrew|date=March 2012|title=MINIMUM FORCE MEETS BRUTALITY: DETENTION, INTERROGATION AND TORTURE IN BRITISH COUNTER-INSURGENCY CAMPAIGNS|journal=Journal of Military Ethics|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=10\u201325|doi=10.1080/15027570.2012.674240|issn=1502-7570}}</ref>  Investigations into these techniques resulted in the publication of policy directives that prohibited the use of hooding, stress positions or wall-standing, noise, sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and drink.\n\nDuring the early stages of Operation Telic in Iraq during 2003 and 2004 some infantry units have been found to have applied these techniques in contravention of standing orders.\n\nThe use of torture is explicitly prohibited. However, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have accused officers of the British Intelligence and Security Services of being at least complicit in the extraction of information from subjects under torture by second parties.\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals|Central Intelligence Agency#Declassified CIA interrogation manuals|Bagram torture and prisoner abuse|Enhanced interrogation techniques|Pride-and-ego down|George W.

Specifically, a grave violation of the Law of Land Warfare. War crimes are  punishable under [[U.S. Code]] as well as the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|U.S. Code of Military Justice]]. There is no statute of limitations for war crimes. Instances of criminal behavior by military, civilian, and contract personnel of the U.S. Department of Defense has happened and has happened with regard to Geneva Category regarding prisoners and detainees. Criminal behavior in this context may range from mishandling to abuse to torture. Military Commanders investigate rigorously any accusation of prisoner mishandling, abuse, or torture. The military continues to vigorously prosecute any such unlawful activity.\n\nArmy regulations and policy have always been clear, the torture or coercion of an enemy prisoner of war during interrogation, or in any other circumstance, is not only unlawful but also an unproductive and unreliable method for gaining information. In addition, [[U.S. Army]] interrogation procedures continue to stress that all detained or captured persons will be treated as Geneva Category Enemy Prisoners of War until determined otherwise by a duly constituted military tribunal.\n\n[[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Jack L. Rives]] ([[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Air Force|U.S.A.F.

Interrogation may involve a diverse array of techniques, ranging from developing a rapport with the subject to outright [[torture]].\n\n==Techniques==\n{{See also|Enhanced interrogation techniques}}\n[[File:Alessandro Magnasco - Interrogations in Jail - WGA13849.jpg|thumb|''Interrogations in Jail'', by [[Alessandro Magnasco]], c. 1710]]\n\nThere are multiple techniques employed in interrogation including deception, torture, increasing suggestibility, and the use of mind-altering drugs.\n\n===Suggestibility===\nA person's [[suggestibility]] is how willing they are to accept and act on suggestions by others. Interrogators seek to increase a subject's suggestibility. Methods used to increase suggestibility may include moderate [[Sleep deprivation#Torture|sleep deprivation]], exposure to constant [[white noise]], and using [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]]ergic drugs such as [[sodium amytal]] or [[sodium thiopental]].  Attempting to increase a subject's suggestibility through these methods may violate local and national laws concerning the treatment of detainees, and in some areas may be considered torture.  Sleep deprivation, exposure to white noise, and the use of drugs may greatly inhibit a detainee's ability to provide truthful and accurate information.\n\n===Deception===\n[[Deception]] can form an important part of effective interrogation. In the [[United States]], there is no law or regulation that forbids the interrogator from lying about the strength of their case, from making misleading statements or from implying that the interviewee has already been implicated in the crime by someone else. See case law on trickery and deception (''[[Frazier v. Cupp]]'').<ref>{{cite web |author=J. D. Obenberger |date=October 1998 |url=http://my.execpc.com/~xxxlaw/GP03-98.htm |title=Police Deception: The Law and the Skin Trade in the Windy City}}</ref>\n\nAs noted above, traditionally the issue of deception is considered from the perspective of the interrogator engaging in deception towards the individual being interrogated.  Recently, work completed regarding effective interview methods used to gather information from individuals who score in the medium to high range on measures of psychopathology and are engaged in deception directed towards the interrogator have appeared in the literature.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perri |first1= Frank S. |last2= Lichtenwald |first2= Terrance G. |year=2008 |url=http://www.all-about-psychology.com/support-files/exposing_fraud_detection_homicide.pdf |title=The Arrogant Chameleons: Exposing Fraud Detection Homicide |work= Forensic Examiner |pages= 26\u201333 |publisher=All-about-psychology.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perri |first1= Frank S. |last2=Lichtenwald |first2= Terrance G. |year=2010 |url=http://www.all-about-forensic-psychology.com/support-files/female-psychopathic-killers.pdf |title=The Last Frontier: Myths & The Female Psychopathic Killer |work= Forensic Examiner |pages= 19:2, 50\u201367 |publisher=All-about-forensic-psychology.com}}</ref>\nThe importance of allowing the psychopathic interviewee to tell one lie after another and not confront until all of the lies have been presented is essential when the goal is to use the interview to expose the improbable statements made during the interview in future court proceedings.\n\n===Verbal and non-verbal cues===\n\nThe major aim of this technique is to investigate to what extent verbal and non-verbal features of liars\u2019 and truth-tellers\u2019 behaviour change during the course of repeated interrogations. It has shown that liars display significantly fewer smiles, self-manipulations, pauses, and less gaze aversion than truth-tellers. According to Granhag & Str\u00f6mwall, there are three approaches to non-verbal deceptive behavior. The first is the emotional approach, which suggests that liars will alter their behaviors based on their own emotional feelings.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite paper |last1=Granhag |first1=P\u00e4r Anders |last2= Str\u00f6mwall |first2= Lief A. |year=2002 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227752082 |title=Repeated interrogations: Verbal and non-verbal cues to deception |publisher=Research Gate}}</ref> For example, if a subject is lying and they begin to experience guilt, they will shift their gaze. The second approach is the cognitive approach, which suggests that lying requires more thought than telling the truth, which in turn, may result in a liar making more errors in speech.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Lastly, the attempted control approach suggests a subject who is lying will attempt to be seemingly normal or honest, and will try to adjust their behaviors to make themselves believable.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Pride-and-ego (up or down)===\n{{Main|Pride-and-ego down}}\nThere are two pride-and-ego techniques used in interrogation. One is the pride-and-ego up approach, while the other is the pride-and-ego down approach. The pride-and-ego up approach involves seeking information from a subject through the use of constant flattery and compliments. As the subject is being continuously praised, the interrogator hopes that through speaking of the subject in a positive light, he or she will provide the necessary information. \nOn the contrary, the [[Pride-and-ego down|pride-and-ego-down]] approach occurs when the interrogator demeans and insults the subject, with the intent of having the subject provide information. The interrogator will verbally/emotionally abuse the subject, hoping that, eventually, the subject will attempt to salvage his or her sense of pride or self-worth.\n\n===Mind-altering drugs===\nThe use of drugs in interrogation is both ineffective and illegal.

To this end, a variety of tactics are employed.<ref>{{cite book |title=Police Interrogation and American Justice |date=June 2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=119 |isbn=9780674035317}}</ref>\n\n=== Tactics ===\nPolice interrogations in the United States involve the suspect voluntarily giving information when being questioned. Police use several different tactics in order for the suspect to elicit information voluntarily. Interrogations are often presented by the cops in a way where the person in question is not presented as a suspect. Investigators often state that they need to ask a couple questions in order to get more information about the crime committed. Police like to refer to this process as an \"interview\" rather than an interrogation as this allows the suspect to feel less threatened. The suspect is asked to come into the police station so that the suspect is not around anyone or anything familiar. Getting the suspect on police territory and in a new environment allows for the police to have better control of the situation, including preventing the suspect from resisting the interrogation operations. Once suspects are in the interrogation room, police often begin by asking background information questions and engaging in small talk. This allows for the suspect to feel less threatened which will elicit voluntary responses to the questions. The interrogation continues and questions about the crime are asked.\n\n=== Reid technique ===\nThe Reid technique is a technique widely used by law enforcement in the U.S. for interrogation purposes. It involves steps to obtaining a confession as well as methods for detecting signs of deception in the suspect's body language. The technique has been criticized for being difficult to apply across cultures and eliciting false confessions from innocent people.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kassin |first1=Saul |last2=Fong |first2=Christina |title='I'm Innocent!': Effects of Training on Judgments of Truth and Deception in the Interrogation room |journal=Law and Human Behavior |volume=23 |number=5 |year=1999 |pages=499\u2013516 |doi=10.1023/a:1022330011811}}</ref>\n\n=== Maximization and minimization === \nPolice interrogation tactics can be classified into two general categories: maximization and minimization. Maximization techniques involve eliciting information from the suspect by emphasizing potential consequences for refusing to admit guilt, presenting false evidence, or accusing the suspect of having committed the act. Minimization techniques entail minimizing the suspect's hand in the crime and the associated consequences of his or her actions for the purposes of eliciting a confession.\n\n==== Linguistic techniques for maximization ====\nAs a maximization tactic inspired by the Reid technique, presupposition-bearing questions (PBQs) are questions that interrogators may use to indirectly gain from suspects confirmation of incriminating information. This is because in answering a PBQ one may inadvertently accept and confirm backgrounded information in the question. For example, during the police interrogation of 14-year-old Lorenzo Montoya in the investigation of the murder of 29-year-old Emily Johnson in Denver in January 2000, police used PBQs in efforts to obtain a false confession.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gaines |first1=Philip |title=Presupposition as investigator certainty in a police interrogation: The case of Lorenzo Montoya's false confession |journal=Discourse & Society |date=July 1, 2018 |volume=29 |issue=4 |page=399\u2013419|doi=10.1177/0957926518754417 |url=https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/15136 }}.</ref> Police transcripts showed that one interrogator had asked \"It [going inside the car and coming to the murder scene] was a mistake though, wasn't it? Were you high at the time?\", with which Lorenzo replied \"No!\". This shows that Lorenzo was either answering the first question, which bears an incriminating presupposition, or answering the second question and thus refusing he was high at the time. However, if Lorenzo's intent was to answer the first question, which directly asks if coming to the murder scene was a mistake, neither a \"no\" or \"yes\" could target the presupposition that Lorenzo was present at the crime scene. Because this piece of information is tucked into the background, either a 'yes' or a 'no' answer would necessitate accepting the proposition that Lorenzo was present at the crime scene.\n\n===Good cop/bad cop===\n{{Main|Good cop/bad cop}}\n[[File:Omar Khadr pulling his hair in frustration during an interrogation by Canadian officials.jpg|thumb|[[Omar Khadr]] pulling his hair in frustration during an interrogation by Canadian officials, February 2003]]\n\nA common technique that is used in interrogation is Good Cop/Bad Cop. With this technique, two officers will pretend to take opposing sides while interacting with a subject. While the \u2018bad cop\u2019 is seemingly against the subject, the 'good cop' seems to take the side of the subject, sympathizing with and even defending the subject. The purpose of this technique is to have the subject think that he or she can confide in the \u2018good cop,\u2019 thus providing him or her with information that may help further the case.\n\n=== Fifth Amendment protections for suspects under interrogation ===\n{{Main|Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution}}\nAlthough police can use linguistic strategies to elicit confessions from suspects, they do not have unconditional power to intimidate suspects into providing information. A number of protections exist for suspects under interrogation, including the Fifth Amendment, Miranda Rights, and other legal mandates.\n\n==== The Fifth Amendment ====\nThe Fifth Amendment, which states that one cannot be made to be \"a witness against himself\", prohibits law enforcement from forcing suspects to offer self-incriminating evidence.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Solan |first1=Lawrence |last2=Tiersma |first2=Peter Meijes |title=Speaking of crime the language of criminal justice |date=2005 |publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press}}</ref> For example, upon being asked by the police if one was present at the scene of a crime, one can refuse to respond. However, law enforcement can require that one provide demonstrative evidence through a blood or DNA sample. \n\n==== The right to counsel ====\nFollowing the [[Escobedo v. Illinois]] ruling, the Supreme Court mandates that a suspect under police interrogation may refuse to respond to questioning until a lawyer is present, which is called invoking one's right to seek counsel. The Supreme Court further elaborated on this mandate following the decision of [[Edwards v. Arizona]] by stating that police cannot continue interrogation once the suspect invokes his or her right to counsel, or until he or she voluntarily agrees to continue questioning.\n\n==== Miranda rights ====\n{{Main|Miranda warning}}\nAs a result of the [[Miranda v. Arizona]] ruling, police are required to read aloud to suspects under interrogation their Miranda Rights afforded to them by the Fifth Amendment, such as the right to remain silent and the right to seek counsel. If the police fail to administer the Miranda rights, all statements under interrogation are prohibited from being used as evidence in court proceedings.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Candela |first1=Kimberlee |editor-first=William J. |editor-last=Chambliss |title=Courts, Law, and Justice |chapter=Miranda Rights |date=June 24, 2011 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |isbn=9781412978576}}</ref>\n\n==Around the world==\n[[File:Japanese police interrogation room - movie set - October 2014.jpg|thumb|Film set of a [[Japan]]ese police interrogation room.]]\n\n===United Kingdom===\nBritish legislation that applies to interrogation activities include:\n* [[Human Rights Act 1998]]\n* [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]]\n* [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]]\n* [[Terrorism Act 2006]]\n\nAs well as legislation, statutory law and regulatory law, various legal precedents called '[[case law]]' also impact interrogation techniques and procedures. One of the first attempts by British Courts to guide and set standards for police officers interrogating suspects was the declaration of the '[[Judges' Rules]]' in 1912 by the judges of the King's Bench Division in England. These rules, although not law, still have weight in the United Kingdom and Canada.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Criminal Investigation: In Search of the Truth|last=Van Allen|first=Bill|publisher=Pearson Canada|year=2012|isbn=978-0-13-800011-0|location=Canada|pages=110}}</ref>  \n\nAll police officers are trained in interview techniques during basic training, further training in detailed interviewing or specialist interviewing is received in specialist or advanced courses, such as [[Criminal Investigation Department|criminal investigation]], fraud investigation or child protection.\n\nMilitary interrogation takes two forms, Tactical Questioning or Detailed Interviewing.  Tactical Questioning is the initial screening of detainees, Detailed Interviewing is the more advanced questioning of subjects.\n\nTraining for all personnel engaged in both TQ and DI takes place at the [[Joint Intelligence Training Group]], Chicksands.\n\nBritish military personnel were found to have misused a number of techniques during the detention of suspects in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Mumford|first=Andrew|date=March 2012|title=MINIMUM FORCE MEETS BRUTALITY: DETENTION, INTERROGATION AND TORTURE IN BRITISH COUNTER-INSURGENCY CAMPAIGNS|journal=Journal of Military Ethics|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=10\u201325|doi=10.1080/15027570.2012.674240|issn=1502-7570}}</ref>  Investigations into these techniques resulted in the publication of policy directives that prohibited the use of hooding, stress positions or wall-standing, noise, sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and drink.\n\nDuring the early stages of Operation Telic in Iraq during 2003 and 2004 some infantry units have been found to have applied these techniques in contravention of standing orders.\n\nThe use of torture is explicitly prohibited. However, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have accused officers of the British Intelligence and Security Services of being at least complicit in the extraction of information from subjects under torture by second parties.\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals|Central Intelligence Agency#Declassified CIA interrogation manuals|Bagram torture and prisoner abuse|Enhanced interrogation techniques|Pride-and-ego down|George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States#Interrogation}}\n\n'''War On Terror'''\n\nDuring the [[War on Terror]], torture has never been authorized or permitted for use at [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]] or any other [[U.S. Department of Defense]] [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]]/[[internment]] facility on captives, whether they are enemy [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], [[detainee]]s, and [[unlawful combatant|unlawful]] [[enemy combatant]]s, though there have been people who have reported being tortured at [[Guantanamo Bay]].\n\nTorture, in this context, is a [[war crime]]. Specifically, a grave violation of the Law of Land Warfare. War crimes are  punishable under [[U.S. Code]] as well as the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|U.S. Code of Military Justice]]. There is no statute of limitations for war crimes. Instances of criminal behavior by military, civilian, and contract personnel of the U.S. Department of Defense has happened and has happened with regard to Geneva Category regarding prisoners and detainees. Criminal behavior in this context may range from mishandling to abuse to torture. Military Commanders investigate rigorously any accusation of prisoner mishandling, abuse, or torture. The military continues to vigorously prosecute any such unlawful activity.\n\nArmy regulations and policy have always been clear, the torture or coercion of an enemy prisoner of war during interrogation, or in any other circumstance, is not only unlawful but also an unproductive and unreliable method for gaining information. In addition, [[U.S. Army]] interrogation procedures continue to stress that all detained or captured persons will be treated as Geneva Category Enemy Prisoners of War until determined otherwise by a duly constituted military tribunal.\n\n[[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Jack L. Rives]] ([[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Air Force|U.S.A.F.

Such early cave dwellers, and other prehistoric peoples, are also called ''cave men'' (the term also has [[Caveman|other meanings]]).  Despite the name, only a small portion of humanity has ever dwelt in caves: caves are rare across most of the world; most caves are dark, cold, and damp; and other cave inhabitants, such as [[bear]]s and [[cave bear]]s, [[Panthera leo spelaea|cave lions]], and [[cave hyena]]s, often made caves inhospitable for people.\n\nThe [[Grotte du Valnet]], a cave in the [[French Riviera]], was used by people approximately one million years ago.  Although stone tools and the remains of eaten animals have been found in the cave, there is no indication that people dwelt in it.\n\nSince about 750,000 years ago, the [[Zhoukoudian]] cave system, in [[Beijing]], China, has been inhabited by various species of human being, including Peking Man (''[[Homo erectus pekinensis]]'') and modern humans (''[[Human evolution#H. sapiens|Homo sapiens]]'').\n\nStarting about 170,000 years ago, some ''Homo sapiens'' lived in some cave systems in what is now South Africa, such as [[Pinnacle Point]] and [[Diepkloof Rock Shelter]]. Caves were the ideal place to shelter from the midday sun in the equatorial regions.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The stable temperatures of caves provided a cool habitat in summers and a warm, dry shelter in the winter.\n\nApproximately 100,000 years ago, some [[Neanderthal]] humans dwelt in caves in Europe and western Asia.  Caves there also were inhabited by some [[Cro-Magnon]]s from about 35,000 years ago until approximately 8,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]]. Both species built shelters, including tents, at the mouths of caves and used the caves\u2019 dark interiors for ceremonies.

They also have used caves for clandestine and other special purposes while living elsewhere.  \n\nPerhaps fleeing the violence of [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]], people left the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in eleven caves near [[Qumran]], in what is now [[Israel]]; the documents remained undisturbed there for approximately 2,000 years, until their discovery in the 1940s and 1950s.  \n\nThe [[DeSoto Caverns]], in what became [[Alabama]], in the United States were a burial ground for local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|tribes]]; the same caves became a violent [[speakeasy]] in the 1920s.

Despite the name, only a small portion of humanity has ever dwelt in caves: caves are rare across most of the world; most caves are dark, cold, and damp; and other cave inhabitants, such as [[bear]]s and [[cave bear]]s, [[Panthera leo spelaea|cave lions]], and [[cave hyena]]s, often made caves inhospitable for people.\n\nThe [[Grotte du Valnet]], a cave in the [[French Riviera]], was used by people approximately one million years ago.  Although stone tools and the remains of eaten animals have been found in the cave, there is no indication that people dwelt in it.\n\nSince about 750,000 years ago, the [[Zhoukoudian]] cave system, in [[Beijing]], China, has been inhabited by various species of human being, including Peking Man (''[[Homo erectus pekinensis]]'') and modern humans (''[[Human evolution#H. sapiens|Homo sapiens]]'').\n\nStarting about 170,000 years ago, some ''Homo sapiens'' lived in some cave systems in what is now South Africa, such as [[Pinnacle Point]] and [[Diepkloof Rock Shelter]]. Caves were the ideal place to shelter from the midday sun in the equatorial regions.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The stable temperatures of caves provided a cool habitat in summers and a warm, dry shelter in the winter.\n\nApproximately 100,000 years ago, some [[Neanderthal]] humans dwelt in caves in Europe and western Asia.  Caves there also were inhabited by some [[Cro-Magnon]]s from about 35,000 years ago until approximately 8,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]]. Both species built shelters, including tents, at the mouths of caves and used the caves\u2019 dark interiors for ceremonies.

They made the earliest paint workshop now known, but apparently did not dwell in the caves.<ref>\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/science/14paint.html?hpw=&pagewanted=all In African Cave, Signs of an Ancient Paint Factory]\", ''The New York Times'', October 13, 2011.</ref>\n\n== Post-historical ==\n[[File:Vivienda troglod\u00edtica en Amboise.jpg|alt=Cave dwellings in Amboise, France|thumb|Cave dwellings in Amboise, Loire Valley, France]]\nEspecially during war and other times of strife, relatively small groups of people have lived temporarily in caves, where they have hidden or otherwise sought refuge.  They also have used caves for clandestine and other special purposes while living elsewhere.  \n\nPerhaps fleeing the violence of [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]], people left the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in eleven caves near [[Qumran]], in what is now [[Israel]]; the documents remained undisturbed there for approximately 2,000 years, until their discovery in the 1940s and 1950s.  \n\nThe [[DeSoto Caverns]], in what became [[Alabama]], in the United States were a burial ground for local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|tribes]]; the same caves became a violent [[speakeasy]] in the 1920s.
