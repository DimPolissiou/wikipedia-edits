After touring in support of their previous album, ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]'' (1984), the band took a break and reconvened in early 1985 to work on a follow-up. The material continued to display the band's exploration of synthesizer-oriented music, this time with the addition of sampling, electronic drums, a string section, and choir, with power being a running lyrical theme. ''Power Windows'' was recorded in [[Montserrat]] and England with [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]] as co-producer and [[Andy Richards]] on additional keyboards.\n\nThe album reached No. 2 in Canada, No. 9 in the United Kingdom, and No. 10 in the United States. In January 1986, the album reached platinum certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for one million copies sold in the United States. Rush released five singles from the album between 1985 and 1986: \"[[The Big Money]]\", \"Territories\", \"[[Manhattan Project (song)|Manhattan Project]]\", \"[[Mystic Rhythms]]\", and \"[[Marathon (Rush song)|Marathon]]\". The band supported the album with their 1985\u20131986 tour.\n\n==Background and writing==\nIn November 1984, the band ended their concert tour in support of their previous album, ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]'' (1984). After a short respite, the group started work for a follow-up album in early 1985. Guitarist [[Alex Lifeson]] looked back at this period, and noted their conscious effort in taking the strongest elements of their previous two records, ''[[Signals (Rush album)|Signals]]'' (1982) and ''Grace Under Pressure'' and capitalising on them for ''Power Windows''. To Lifeson, this resulted in a more cohesive and satisfying album.<ref name=kerrang1985>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19851114kerrang.htm|title=Pane and Pleasure|magazine=Kerrang!|first=Mark|last=Putterford|issue=107|date=November 14, 1985|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1985, Rush had relocated to Elora Sound Studios in [[Elora, Ontario]] to write and rehearse new songs. Drummer [[Neil Peart]] would write a set of lyrics from the studio's farmhouse while Lifeson and frontman [[Geddy Lee]] worked on music to fit Peart's words in the adjacent barn which housed a [[Multitrack recording|24-track]] recording studio. Peart worked on a small desk in his room, \"about the right size for a five-year-old\".<ref name=tourbook>{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/powerwindows.html#tourbook|title=Looking Through Power Windows|date=1986|first=Neil|last=Peart|publisher=Anthem Records}}</ref> During this time, Peart researched the [[Manhattan Project]] to write lyrics for the same-titled song. He also had a head start, having written outline lyrics for \"The Big Money\", \"Mystic Rhythms\", and \"Marathon\" before these sessions had begun.<ref name=tourbook /> Lee and Lifeson sorted through jams recorded at soundchecks on tour and Lifeson's own tapes of ideas to assemble music for the three tracks, with each song taking up to a week.<ref name=tourbook /> They then began on \"Middletown Dreams\", \"Marathon\" once again, and then \"Grand Designs\". Having worked out some material, Rush underwent a five-day warm-up tour in Florida in March 1985 to sharpen their performance and to test the new songs on stage prior to recording.<ref name=tourbook /> Peart continued to work on lyrics in his hotel room in Miami.<ref name=tourbook />\n\nFollowing their warm-up gigs, the band returned to Elora and continued working on their new songs, their break away being a positive impact on their work upon returning. Peart had initially struggled to finish \"Territories\" and \"Manhattan Project\", \"but now they just fell together\".<ref name=tourbook /> On their first day back at Elora, Peart began work on lyrics for \"Emotion Detector\" as the group had discussed the possibility of recording a ballad for their new album. Upon presenting his words to Lee and Lifeson, his lyrics fit to the piece of music that his bandmates were working on at the time.<ref name=tourbook /> This was followed by Rush arranging the music for \"Emotion Detector\" and \"Territories\", after which they had assembled a demo tape of seven new songs ready to present to Collins for recording.<ref name=tourbook />\n\nLater in 1985, Peart told an interviewer that Rush's sound \"is changing from having been progressive to not being progressive\".<ref name=ModernDrummer>{{Cite book|first1=Jim|last1=Berti|first2=Durrell|last2=Bowman|title=Rush and Philosophy: Heart and Mind United|publisher=Open Court|year=2013|isbn=978-0-8126-9729-2|series=Popular Culture and Philosophy|volume=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSg7bnFJDbgC&pg=PT217|page=217}} Quoting an interview with Scott K. Fish published in January 1986 ''Modern Drummer'' magazine.</ref> He noted that though the album might \"seem simpler\", it was just as difficult to compose and perform.<ref name=ModernDrummer /> Lifeson expressed some resistance to the emphasis on keyboards during this period of their history. He noted the trend began on ''Signals'' which pushed his guitar parts too far into the background as a result. However, he thought Rush achieved a much greater balance of the two instruments on ''Power Windows'', which he thought ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'' (1981) successfully had done.<ref name=kerrang1985 />\n\n==Production==\n===Recording===\nRush recorded ''Power Windows'' from April to August 1985 in five different recording studios. The group recorded ''Power Windows'' with a new producer, [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]].<ref name=kerrang1985 /> During their warm-up gigs in Florida, the band first met Australian engineer James \"Jimbo\" Barton who Collins had recommended. They accepted, and Peart later praised Barton's contributions and suggestions to the band, considering his small recommendations to improve a song, which he referred to as \"events\", was \"just what we were looking for\".<ref name=tourbook /> Lifeson compared the experience of recording ''Power Windows'' as more pleasant and fun than ''Grace Under Pressure'', which presented various problems for the band. He added that the album contained elements that Rush had not incorporated before and broke several boundaries that had existed with previous albums.<ref name=kerrang1985 /> Lee supported this view and said the group decided \"not to hold anything back\" and make the album first and focus later on the music's onstage presentation.<ref name=IMARW1985>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19851200intlmusicianrecordingworld.htm|title=Grand Designs for the Future|first=Philip|last=Bashe|date=December 1985|magazine=International Musician and Recording World|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:AIR Studio ruins Montserrat May 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Rush relocated to AIR Studios in Montserrat, the ruins of which are pictured here in 2013, to record guitar overdubs.]]\nRecording began at [[The Manor Studios]] in Oxfordshire, England, where the basic rhythm, keyboards, and bass tracks were recorded more quickly than usual, in the span of five weeks, to capture more spontaneous performances ready for overdubs.<ref name=IMARW1985 /><ref name=tourbook /> Here, the music was recorded using two [[Studer]] A800 24-track tape machines with an SSL console.<ref name=IMARW1985 /> It was during sessions at The Manor where Rush brought in musician [[Andy Richards]] to play additional synthesizers and assist in their programming. His rig consisted of a [[PPG Wave]] 2.3 synthesizer connected to a [[Roland MKS-80|Roland Super Jupiter]] module through a [[MIDI]] system, a Yamaha QX-1 digital sequencer, and a [[Roland Jupiter-8]] and [[Yamaha DX7]] synthesizer.<ref name=IMARW1985 /> In one incident, Peart's drum technician Larry Allen drove with him to London to collect a set of African and Indian drums to use on \"Mystic Rhythms\", and bongos for \"Territories\".<ref name=tourbook />\n\nIn May 1985, the band had relocated to [[Associated Independent Recording|AIR Studios]] in the island of [[Montserrat]] in the Caribbean. They had discussed recording at the studio for several years and booked the facility for three weeks for Lifeson to record guitar overdubs.<ref name=tourbook /> The tracks were put down using two Studer tape recorders with a Neve console. Collins recalled this period of recording as painstaking work due to the various combination of microphone and amplifier set-ups that were experimented.<ref name=IMARW1985 /> This was followed by a return to England in June to record in London, firstly at [[Sarm East Studios|SARM East Studios]]. The band chose to live together in a single apartment rather than separate hotel rooms. At SARM East, the guitar solos and Lee's vocals were put down.<ref name=tourbook />\n\nMixing began in July after the band took a one-week break from the material, which coincided with decisions on the final running order, artwork, credits, and photos.<ref name=tourbook /> In August, the string section was recorded which featured a 30-piece orchestra in studio 1 at [[Abbey Road Studios]]. Rush wanted musician and arranger [[Anne Dudley]] to complete the string arrangements, which she agreed to do,<ref name=cmusician1985 /> and the group was conducted by [[Andrew Pryce Jackman]]. A 25-piece choir was recorded at [[Angel Recording Studios]] for the ending of \"Marathon\".<ref name=tourbook /><ref name=cmusician1985 /> The album completed, Lee oversaw the mastering in New York City in September, and proofs were approved for the album cover.<ref name=tourbook />\n\n===Songs===\n''Power Windows'' lyrics are focused primarily on various manifestations of power. For example, \"Territories\" comments on nationalism around the world. Like \"[[Subdivisions (song)|Subdivisions]]\" from ''[[Signals (Rush album)|Signals]]'', \"Middletown Dreams\" explores suburban monotony and the average person's attempts to temporarily escape it.<ref name=\"Visions\">{{cite book|last1=Banasiewicz|first1=Bill|title=Rush \u2013 Visions: The Official Biography|chapter=Catching the window \u2013 a glimpse beyond|editors=[[Chris Charlesworth]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|year=1988|location=London, UK|pages=84\u201387|isbn=0-7119-1162-2}}</ref> \"Grand Designs\" was partly written to criticise mainstream music which the group believed was too superficial. The song also echoes individualistic themes such as non-conformism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rushvault.com/2011/02/07/grand-designs/|title=Grand Designs|date=7 February 2011|website=rushvault.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124071048/https://rushvault.com/2011/02/07/grand-designs/|archivedate=24 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"The Big Money\" features the sampling of Peart's voice using an AMS{{Technical-statement}} and triggered through his Simmons drum kit.<ref name=cmusician1985 />\n\n\"Manhattan Project\" explores the development and explosion of the first [[nuclear weapon]] at the [[Manhattan Project]]. The track was difficult for the band to put together, partly due to Peart's difficulty in writing lyrics from an objective point of view, rather than as an observer of the event. Lifeson recalled that Peart had \"thoroughly\" researched on the topic beforehand.<ref name=kerrang1985 />\n\n\"Territories\" was another difficult track for Rush to complete. After Peart had written some lyrical ideas he went through them with Lee, who noticed it was telling a story and found them difficult to sing once he and Lifeson had developed music for them. Peart then rewrote them in a more direct way which suited Lee better.<ref name=kerrang1985 />\n\n\"Middletown Dreams\" involved several rewrites before the band reached a working arrangement. After the album was completed, Lifeson expressed some dissatisfaction with the guitar parts, but it grew to become a \"very satisfying\" track for him.<ref name=kerrang1985 />\n\n\"Marathon\" was anticipated by Lifeson to be difficult to arrange and record, but it turned out to be one of the easiest songs on the album to complete.<ref name=kerrang1985 /> It contains various samples, the least amount of recorded overdubs, and incorporates the string section and choir recorded in London. Collins had the idea of using a choir and the band, upon witnessing the recording, saw the humour in having \"pregnant women and old men sing our song\".<ref name=cmusician1985>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19851200cm.htm|title=Baroque Cosmologies in Their Past, The Boys Focus on \"The Perfect Song\"|first=Perry|last=Stern|magazine=Canadian Musician|date=December 1985|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref> Lifeson considered the song to be close to Peart as he had taken up cycling during days off on the ''Grace Under Pressure'' tour, riding 100 miles each time.<ref name=kerrang1985 />\n\n\"Emotion Detector\" was initially anticipated to be easy to complete, but was actually difficult.<ref name=kerrang1985 />\n\n\"Mystic Rhythms\", as described by Lee, is \"the most synthetic track on the record\" with each instrument being fed through \"a synthesized something\".<ref name=cmusician1985 /> It features Lifeson playing an acoustic Ovation guitar which generated a synthesizer-like sound once fed through amplification.<ref name=cmusician1985 />\n\n\"Territories\" features the lyric \"Better beer\", which is an inside joke. Peart played his drum kit without a [[snare drum]], and the middle section features a sample of Lee's voice saying the phrase \"Round and round\".<ref name=cmusician1985 />\n\n===Sleeve design===\nThe pictures on the front and back covers were painted by Hugh Syme, from reference photos taken by photographer Dimo Safari, and the model is Neill Cunningham from Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2016/01/20/rushs-power-windows-a-window-into-record-store-owners-past.html|title=Rush's Power Windows a window into record-store owner\u2019s past \u2013 The Star|website=thestar.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019111330/https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2016/01/20/rushs-power-windows-a-window-into-record-store-owners-past.html|archivedate=19 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Power Windows cover\">{{cite web | title=We Interviewed the Guy from Rush\u2019s 1985 \u2018Power Windows\u2019 Cover | work=Vice | first=Tom | last=Beedham | date=January 25, 2016 | url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/rnw5kk/we-interviewed-the-guy-from-rushs-1985-power-windows-cover | accessdate=January 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Power Windows'' was released on October 14, 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=power+windows#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum Search \u2013 \"Power Windows\"|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 =[[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/power-windows-mw0000191583|title=Power Windows \u2013 Rush|accessdate=2011-08-27|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523163639/http://www.allmusic.com/album/power-windows-mw0000191583|archivedate=2013-05-23}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev2score = (favourable)<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite journal|title=Power Windows|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=30 January 1986|first=David|last=Fricke|authorlink=David Fricke|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/power-windows-19860130|accessdate=2011-08-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014042442/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/power-windows-19860130|archivedate=14 October 2013}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev3score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/power-windows-19860130|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222001032/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/power-windows-19860130|archivedate=22 December 2010|title=Album Reviews: Power Windows|accessdate=11 July 2016|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Kerrang!]]''\n|rev4score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dickson|first1=Dave|title=[[Kerrang!]]|chapter=Stained Glass|volume=105|publisher=Morgan Grampian|date=17 October 1985|location=London, UK|page=18}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''Rock Hard'' (de)\n| rev5score = 9/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Rensen|first=Michael|title=Rock Hard review|url=http://www.rockhard.de/megazine/reviewarchiv/review-anzeigen.html?tx_rxsearch_pi1%5Breview%5D=9542|accessdate=24 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123190605/http://www.rockhard.de/megazine/reviewarchiv/review-anzeigen.html?tx_rxsearch_pi1%5Breview%5D=9542|archivedate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n| rev6 = The Daily Vault\n| rev6Score = B+<ref name=vault>{{cite web |url= http://dailyvault.com/toc.php5?review=343 |title=The Daily Vault Music Reviews : Power Windows |first=Christopher |last=Thelen |work=dailyvault.com |year=2019 |accessdate=28 January 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n''Power Windows'' has been met with mostly positive reviews from music critics. [[AllMusic]]'s Eduardo Rivadavia retrospectively described the album as Rush's coldest album, citing the sparse, horn-like guitar playing of Lifeson, the prominent synthesizer of Lee and Peart's crisp, clinical percussion and stark lyrical themes. However, he also described the album as one that rewards patience and repeated listens.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|title=Power Windows|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/power-windows-mw0000191583|website=AllMusic|accessdate=19 March 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523163639/http://www.allmusic.com/album/power-windows-mw0000191583|archivedate=23 May 2013}}</ref>  ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, in a positive review of the album, highlighted a number of bands that seemingly influenced ''Power Windows'', such as [[The Police]], [[U2]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]].

But since ''Power Windows'' was originally mixed on digital equipment at 16-bit/44.1&nbsp;kHz, no audio above 22&nbsp;kHz exists in the original digital master or any of the remasters, which is why many digital music stores are only selling the album at a maximum sample rate of 48&nbsp;kHz.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rush \u2013 new 2015 vinyl and hi-res reissues thread|url=http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/rush-new-2015-vinyl-and-hi-res-reissues-thread.399367/|website=Steve Hoffman Music Forums|accessdate=10 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710130122/http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/rush-new-2015-vinyl-and-hi-res-reissues-thread.399367/|archivedate=10 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| all_lyrics      = [[Neil Peart]]\n| all_music       = [[Alex Lifeson]] and [[Geddy Lee]]\n| headline        = Side one\n| title1          = [[The Big Money]]\n| length1         = 5:36\n| title2          = Grand Designs\n| length2         = 5:07\n| title3          = [[Manhattan Project (song)|Manhattan Project]]\n| length3         = 5:09\n| title4          = [[Marathon (Rush song)|Marathon]]\n| length4         = 6:11\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Side two\n| title5          = Territories\n| length5         = 6:20\n| title6          = Middletown Dreams\n| length6         = 5:19\n| title7          = Emotion Detector\n| length7         = 5:11\n| title8          = [[Mystic Rhythms]]\n| length8         = 5:54\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n'''Rush'''\n*[[Geddy Lee]] \u2013 lead vocals, bass guitar, bass pedals, synthesizers\n*[[Alex Lifeson]] \u2013 electric and acoustic guitars\n*[[Neil Peart]] \u2013 drums, percussion, electric percussion\n\n'''Additional personnel'''\n*[[Andy Richards]] \u2013 additional keyboards, synthesizer programming\n*Jim Burgess \u2013 synthesizer programming\n*[[Anne Dudley]] \u2013 string arrangement, conductor\n*[[Andrew Jackman]] \u2013 conductor, choir arrangements\n*The Choir \u2013 additional vocals\n\n'''Production'''\n*Rush \u2013 production, arrangements\n*[[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]] \u2013 production, arrangements\n*Jim Barton \u2013 engineer\n*Matt Butler \u2013 assistant engineer\n*Stephen Chase \u2013 assistant engineer\n*[[Dave Meegan]] \u2013 assistant engineer\n*Heff Moraes \u2013 assistant engineer\n*[[Bob Ludwig]] \u2013 mastering\n*Brian Lee \u2013 mastering\n*[[Hugh Syme]] \u2013 art direction, graphics, cover design, and painting\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1985)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Canadian [[RPM100]] Albums<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0610&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=m89iq841abagb37ld9c0fdc1f3|title=Top Albums/CDs \u2013 Volume 43, No. 14, December 14, 1985|accessdate=2011-11-21|publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809113259/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0610&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=m89iq841abagb37ld9c0fdc1f3|archivedate=August 9, 2014}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |[[Dutch Albums Chart]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Rush&titel=Power+Windows&cat=a|title=Rush \u2013 Power Windows (Album)|accessdate=2011-11-21|work=Gfk Dutch Charts|publisher=[[Media Control Charts]]|language=Dutch|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HGKTzjBr?url=http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Rush|archivedate=2013-06-10}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|44\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |[[Swedish Albums Chart]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Rush&titel=Power+Windows&cat=a|title=Rush \u2013 Power Windows (Album)|accessdate=2011-11-21|work=Swedishcharts.com|publisher=[[Media Control Charts]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HGKT8t54?url=http://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Rush|archivedate=2013-06-10}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|26\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |[[UK Album Chart]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/Power%20Windows |title=Power Windows The Official Charts Company|accessdate=2011-11-21|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|9\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=rush|chart=all}} | title = Power Windows \u2013 Rush | accessdate = 2011-11-21 | work = Billboard.com | publisher = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|10\n|-\n|}\n\n==Singles==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Information\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|'''\"[[The Big Money]]\"'''\n*Released: September 26, 1985\n*Written by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart\n*Produced by: [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]] and Rush\n*Chart positions: No. 45 US Hot 100;

After touring in support of their previous album, ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]'' (1984), the band took a break and reconvened in early 1985 to work on a follow-up. The material continued to display the band's exploration of synthesizer-oriented music, this time with the addition of sampling, electronic drums, a string section, and choir, with power being a running lyrical theme. ''Power Windows'' was recorded in [[Montserrat]] and England with [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]] as co-producer and [[Andy Richards]] on additional keyboards.\n\nThe album reached No. 2 in Canada, No. 9 in the United Kingdom, and No. 10 in the United States. In January 1986, the album reached platinum certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for one million copies sold in the United States. Rush released five singles from the album between 1985 and 1986: \"[[The Big Money]]\", \"Territories\", \"[[Manhattan Project (song)|Manhattan Project]]\", \"[[Mystic Rhythms]]\", and \"[[Marathon (Rush song)|Marathon]]\". The band supported the album with their 1985\u20131986 tour.\n\n==Background and writing==\nIn November 1984, the band ended their concert tour in support of their previous album, ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]'' (1984). After a short respite, the group started work for a follow-up album in early 1985. Guitarist [[Alex Lifeson]] looked back at this period, and noted their conscious effort in taking the strongest elements of their previous two records, ''[[Signals (Rush album)|Signals]]'' (1982) and ''Grace Under Pressure'' and capitalising on them for ''Power Windows''. To Lifeson, this resulted in a more cohesive and satisfying album.<ref name=kerrang1985>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19851114kerrang.htm|title=Pane and Pleasure|magazine=Kerrang!|first=Mark|last=Putterford|issue=107|date=November 14, 1985|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1985, Rush had relocated to Elora Sound Studios in [[Elora, Ontario]] to write and rehearse new songs. Drummer [[Neil Peart]] would write a set of lyrics from the studio's farmhouse while Lifeson and frontman [[Geddy Lee]] worked on music to fit Peart's words in the adjacent barn which housed a [[Multitrack recording|24-track]] recording studio. Peart worked on a small desk in his room, \"about the right size for a five-year-old\".<ref name=tourbook>{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/powerwindows.html#tourbook|title=Looking Through Power Windows|date=1986|first=Neil|last=Peart|publisher=Anthem Records}}</ref> During this time, Peart researched the [[Manhattan Project]] to write lyrics for the same-titled song. He also had a head start, having written outline lyrics for \"The Big Money\", \"Mystic Rhythms\", and \"Marathon\" before these sessions had begun.<ref name=tourbook /> Lee and Lifeson sorted through jams recorded at soundchecks on tour and Lifeson's own tapes of ideas to assemble music for the three tracks, with each song taking up to a week.<ref name=tourbook /> They then began on \"Middletown Dreams\", \"Marathon\" once again, and then \"Grand Designs\". Having worked out some material, Rush underwent a five-day warm-up tour in Florida in March 1985 to sharpen their performance and to test the new songs on stage prior to recording.<ref name=tourbook /> Peart continued to work on lyrics in his hotel room in Miami.<ref name=tourbook />\n\nFollowing their warm-up gigs, the band returned to Elora and continued working on their new songs, their break away being a positive impact on their work upon returning. Peart had initially struggled to finish \"Territories\" and \"Manhattan Project\", \"but now they just fell together\".<ref name=tourbook /> On their first day back at Elora, Peart began work on lyrics for \"Emotion Detector\" as the group had discussed the possibility of recording a ballad for their new album. Upon presenting his words to Lee and Lifeson, his lyrics fit to the piece of music that his bandmates were working on at the time.<ref name=tourbook /> This was followed by Rush arranging the music for \"Emotion Detector\" and \"Territories\", after which they had assembled a demo tape of seven new songs ready to present to Collins for recording.<ref name=tourbook />\n\nLater in 1985, Peart told an interviewer that Rush's sound \"is changing from having been progressive to not being progressive\".<ref name=ModernDrummer>{{Cite book|first1=Jim|last1=Berti|first2=Durrell|last2=Bowman|title=Rush and Philosophy: Heart and Mind United|publisher=Open Court|year=2013|isbn=978-0-8126-9729-2|series=Popular Culture and Philosophy|volume=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSg7bnFJDbgC&pg=PT217|page=217}} Quoting an interview with Scott K. Fish published in January 1986 ''Modern Drummer'' magazine.</ref> He noted that though the album might \"seem simpler\", it was just as difficult to compose and perform.<ref name=ModernDrummer /> Lifeson expressed some resistance to the emphasis on keyboards during this period of their history. He noted the trend began on ''Signals'' which pushed his guitar parts too far into the background as a result. However, he thought Rush achieved a much greater balance of the two instruments on ''Power Windows'', which he thought ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'' (1981) successfully had done.<ref name=kerrang1985 />\n\n==Production==\n===Recording===\nRush recorded ''Power Windows'' from April to August 1985 in five different recording studios. The group recorded ''Power Windows'' with a new producer, [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]].<ref name=kerrang1985 /> During their warm-up gigs in Florida, the band first met Australian engineer James \"Jimbo\" Barton who Collins had recommended. They accepted, and Peart later praised Barton's contributions and suggestions to the band, considering his small recommendations to improve a song, which he referred to as \"events\", was \"just what we were looking for\".<ref name=tourbook /> Lifeson compared the experience of recording ''Power Windows'' as more pleasant and fun than ''Grace Under Pressure'', which presented various problems for the band. He added that the album contained elements that Rush had not incorporated before and broke several boundaries that had existed with previous albums.<ref name=kerrang1985 /> Lee supported this view and said the group decided \"not to hold anything back\" and make the album first and focus later on the music's onstage presentation.<ref name=IMARW1985>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19851200intlmusicianrecordingworld.htm|title=Grand Designs for the Future|first=Philip|last=Bashe|date=December 1985|magazine=International Musician and Recording World|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:AIR Studio ruins Montserrat May 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Rush relocated to AIR Studios in Montserrat, the ruins of which are pictured here in 2013, to record guitar overdubs.]]\nRecording began at [[The Manor Studios]] in Oxfordshire, England, where the basic rhythm, keyboards, and bass tracks were recorded more quickly than usual, in the span of five weeks, to capture more spontaneous performances ready for overdubs.<ref name=IMARW1985 /><ref name=tourbook /> Here, the music was recorded using two [[Studer]] A800 24-track tape machines with an SSL console.<ref name=IMARW1985 /> It was during sessions at The Manor where Rush brought in musician [[Andy Richards]] to play additional synthesizers and assist in their programming. His rig consisted of a [[PPG Wave]] 2.3 synthesizer connected to a [[Roland MKS-80|Roland Super Jupiter]] module through a [[MIDI]] system, a Yamaha QX-1 digital sequencer, and a [[Roland Jupiter-8]] and [[Yamaha DX7]] synthesizer.<ref name=IMARW1985 /> In one incident, Peart's drum technician Larry Allen drove with him to London to collect a set of African and Indian drums to use on \"Mystic Rhythms\", and bongos for \"Territories\".<ref name=tourbook />\n\nIn May 1985, the band had relocated to [[Associated Independent Recording|AIR Studios]] in the island of [[Montserrat]] in the Caribbean. They had discussed recording at the studio for several years and booked the facility for three weeks for Lifeson to record guitar overdubs.<ref name=tourbook /> The tracks were put down using two Studer tape recorders with a Neve console. Collins recalled this period of recording as painstaking work due to the various combination of microphone and amplifier set-ups that were experimented.<ref name=IMARW1985 /> This was followed by a return to England in June to record in London, firstly at [[Sarm East Studios|SARM East Studios]]. The band chose to live together in a single apartment rather than separate hotel rooms. At SARM East, the guitar solos and Lee's vocals were put down.<ref name=tourbook />\n\nMixing began in July after the band took a one-week break from the material, which coincided with decisions on the final running order, artwork, credits, and photos.<ref name=tourbook /> In August, the string section was recorded which featured a 30-piece orchestra in studio 1 at [[Abbey Road Studios]]. Rush wanted musician and arranger [[Anne Dudley]] to complete the string arrangements, which she agreed to do,<ref name=cmusician1985 /> and the group was conducted by [[Andrew Pryce Jackman]]. A 25-piece choir was recorded at [[Angel Recording Studios]] for the ending of \"Marathon\".<ref name=tourbook /><ref name=cmusician1985 /> The album completed, Lee oversaw the mastering in New York City in September, and proofs were approved for the album cover.<ref name=tourbook />\n\n===Songs===\n''Power Windows'' lyrics are focused primarily on various manifestations of power. For example, \"Territories\" comments on nationalism around the world. Like \"[[Subdivisions (song)|Subdivisions]]\" from ''[[Signals (Rush album)|Signals]]'', \"Middletown Dreams\" explores suburban monotony and the average person's attempts to temporarily escape it.<ref name=\"Visions\">{{cite book|last1=Banasiewicz|first1=Bill|title=Rush \u2013 Visions: The Official Biography|chapter=Catching the window \u2013 a glimpse beyond|editors=[[Chris Charlesworth]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|year=1988|location=London, UK|pages=84\u201387|isbn=0-7119-1162-2}}</ref> \"Grand Designs\" was partly written to criticise mainstream music which the group believed was too superficial. The song also echoes individualistic themes such as non-conformism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rushvault.com/2011/02/07/grand-designs/|title=Grand Designs|date=7 February 2011|website=rushvault.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124071048/https://rushvault.com/2011/02/07/grand-designs/|archivedate=24 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"The Big Money\" features the sampling of Peart's voice using an AMS and triggered through his Simmons drum kit.<ref name=cmusician1985 />\n\n\"Manhattan Project\" explores the development and explosion of the first [[nuclear weapon]] at the [[Manhattan Project]]. The track was difficult for the band to put together, partly due to Peart's difficulty in writing lyrics from an objective point of view, rather than as an observer of the event. Lifeson recalled that Peart had \"thoroughly\" researched on the topic beforehand.<ref name=kerrang1985 />\n\n\"Territories\" was another difficult track for Rush to complete. After Peart had written some lyrical ideas he went through them with Lee, who noticed it was telling a story and found them difficult to sing once he and Lifeson had developed music for them. Peart then rewrote them in a more direct way which suited Lee better.<ref name=kerrang1985 />\n\n\"Middletown Dreams\" involved several rewrites before the band reached a working arrangement.
