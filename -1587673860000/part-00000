She was murdered in the Sydney suburb of Paddington, New South Wales and the perpetrator has not been apprehended.\n\n== Biography ==\nBroadhurst was born in [[Mount Perry, Queensland]], at Mungy Station. She became a singer, winning local [[eisteddfod#Australia|eisteddfods]], and joined a group known as the Smart Set Diggers who performed in [[Toowoomba, Queensland]]. In 1922 she joined a comedy sextet known as the \"Globe Trotters\" and later the \"Broadcasters\", who toured South East Asia and China. In 1926 she established the Broadhurst Academy in [[Shanghai]], offering tuition in violin, pianoforte, voice production, [[banjolele]] playing, modern ballroom dancing, classical dancing, musical culture and journalism.<ref name=\"ADB\">Anne-Marie Van de Ven, [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10059b.htm?hilite=Florence%3BBroadhurst Broadhurst, Florence Maud (1899 - 1977)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524113442/http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10059b.htm?hilite=Florence;Broadhurst |date=24 May 2011 }}, Australian Dictionary of Biography, Supplementary Volume, Melbourne University Press, 2005, pp 46-47.</ref>\n\nAfter her return to Queensland in 1927, she sustained head injuries in a car accident. She then went to England and in 1929 married Percy Walter Gladstone Kann, an English stockbroker.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/broadhurst-florence-maud-12818|title=Broadhurst, Florence Maud (1899\u20131977)|last=Van de Ven|first=Anne-Marie|date=2005|website=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405015325/http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/broadhurst-florence-maud-12818|archive-date=5 April 2018|url-status=live|access-date=15 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They co-directed Pellier Ltd, Robes & Modes, and she called herself Madame Pellier. Kann and Broadhurst separated, and Broadhurst became involved with diesel engineer Leonard Lloyd-Lewis, living in Banstead from 1939. During [[World War II]] she joined the Australian Women's Voluntary Services, offering hospitality to Australian soldiers. In 1949, the couple and their son Robert moved to Australia, where she maintained the fiction that she was British. She travelled widely and produced 114 landscape paintings, which were first shown as \"Paintings of Australia\" in 1954 at [[David Jones (merchant)|David Jones Art Gallery]], [[Sydney]], then later in [[Brisbane]] and [[Canberra]]. In the late 1950s Lloyd-Lewis left her for a woman younger than their own son. She was a foundation member of the Art Gallery Society of New South Wales and a member of the Society of Interior Designers of Australia, was a teacher of printmaking and sculpture at the National Art School and was also involved in a variety of charitable activities. Her husband left her and their son in 1961. Broadhurst then ran a motor-sales company with her son.\n\nShe worked from a studio at 12-24 Roylston Street, [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]]. She travelled to England in 1973 to receive cell therapy treatment for her failing eyesight and hearing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Death==\nBroadhurst was bludgeoned to death with a large piece of timber in her Paddington studio on 15 October 1977. The murder was never solved, but there has been some speculation that Broadhurst was a victim of English Australian serial killer [[John Wayne Glover]], who was convicted of murdering six elderly women on the Sydney North Shore district between 1989 and 1990, and is thought by police to have been responsible for other deaths.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Jano|title=Granny killer found dead in cell|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/granny-killer-found-dead-in-cell/2005/09/09/1125772681493.html|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=9 September 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924201827/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/granny-killer-found-dead-in-cell/2005/09/09/1125772681493.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In [[Gillian Armstrong]]'s ''[[Unfolding Florence: The Many Lives of Florence Broadhurst]]'', friends and employees of Broadhurst stated that they believed the killer may have been known to her and that the motive may have been financial. This was due to the presence of two cups of tea near her body, suggesting a meeting or appointment, and the killer's apparent knowledge of her factory's layout.\n\n== Wallpapers ==\nIn 1959 Broadhurst established Australian (Hand Printed) Wallpapers Pty Ltd., which later became Florence Broadhurst Wallpapers Pty Ltd, advertised as \"the only studio of its kind in the world\".<ref name =\"ADB\"/> Her brightly coloured geometric and nature-inspired oversized designs were all hand printed. Technical advances made in her studio included printing onto metallic surfaces, the development of a washable, vinyl-coating finish and a drying rack system that allowed her wallpapers to be produced in large quantities.<ref name =\"ADB\"/> By 1972, her wallpapers reportedly contained around 800 designs in eighty different colours,<ref name =\"ADB\"/> while by the mid-1970s she monopolised the quality end of the Australian market and was exporting worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|website=Signature Prints|url=http://www.signatureprints.com.au/aboutus/aboutus_flobro.html|title=Florence Broadhurst's Amazing Adventure|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210202407/http://www.signatureprints.com.au/aboutus/aboutus_flobro.html|archivedate=10 February 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nBroadhurst's library of wooden silk-printing screens and film positives was sold to Wilson Fabrics and Wallcoverings in 1978, just one year after her death. However, the decline of wallpaper as a popular form of home furnishing in the 1980s saw the collection languish, and it was later re-sold to Signature Prints Pty Ltd. Signature Prints in turn was purchased by a conglomerate led by current CEO David Lennie in 1989. Lennie had previously run a small wallpaper company in Auckland, New Zealand and briefly met Florence Broadhurst before her death.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Chee Soon & Fitzgerald, a tiny but influential Sydney design store, held the wholesale and retail distribution rights for Broadhurst wallpaper. This led to some popularity in Sydney design circles but little media attention. In the early 2000s, Signature Prints made a conscious decision to promote Broadhurst's designs overseas, specifically in the UK. This effort, coupled with an international resurgence of interest in wallpaper, greatly increased the designer's profile and led to distribution deals being struck for both the UK and the US in 2003.\n\nFive hundred and thirty Broadhurst designs are in the company's collection but only a small proportion are printed by the company as wallpaper and fabric.

She was murdered in the Sydney suburb of Paddington, New South Wales and the perpetrator has not been apprehended.\n\n== Biography ==\nBroadhurst was born in [[Mount Perry, Queensland]], at Mungy Station. She became a singer, winning local [[eisteddfod#Australia|eisteddfods]], and joined a group known as the Smart Set Diggers who performed in [[Toowoomba, Queensland]]. In 1922 she joined a comedy sextet known as the \"Globe Trotters\" and later the \"Broadcasters\", who toured South East Asia and China. In 1926 she established the Broadhurst Academy in [[Shanghai]], offering tuition in violin, pianoforte, voice production, [[banjolele]] playing, modern ballroom dancing, classical dancing, musical culture and journalism.<ref name=\"ADB\">Anne-Marie Van de Ven, [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10059b.htm?hilite=Florence%3BBroadhurst Broadhurst, Florence Maud (1899 - 1977)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524113442/http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10059b.htm?hilite=Florence;Broadhurst |date=24 May 2011 }}, Australian Dictionary of Biography, Supplementary Volume, Melbourne University Press, 2005, pp 46-47.</ref>\n\nAfter her return to Queensland in 1927, she sustained head injuries in a car accident.

Kann and Broadhurst separated, and Broadhurst became involved with diesel engineer Leonard Lloyd-Lewis, living in Banstead from 1939. During [[World War II]] she joined the Australian Women's Voluntary Services, offering hospitality to Australian soldiers. In 1949, the couple and their son Robert moved to Australia, where she maintained the fiction that she was British. She travelled widely and produced 114 landscape paintings, which were first shown as \"Paintings of Australia\" in 1954 at [[David Jones (merchant)|David Jones Art Gallery]], [[Sydney]], then later in [[Brisbane]] and [[Canberra]]. In the late 1950s Lloyd-Lewis left her for a woman younger than their own son. She was a foundation member of the Art Gallery Society of New South Wales and a member of the Society of Interior Designers of Australia, was a teacher of printmaking and sculpture at the National Art School and was also involved in a variety of charitable activities. Her husband left her and their son in 1961. Broadhurst then ran a motor-sales company with her son.\n\nShe worked from a studio at 12-24 Roylston Street, [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]]. She travelled to England in 1973 to receive cell therapy treatment for her failing eyesight and hearing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Death==\nBroadhurst was bludgeoned to death with a large piece of timber in her Paddington studio on 15 October 1977. The murder was never solved, but there has been some speculation that Broadhurst was a victim of English Australian serial killer [[John Wayne Glover]], who was convicted of murdering six elderly women on the Sydney North Shore district between 1989 and 1990, and is thought by police to have been responsible for other deaths.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Jano|title=Granny killer found dead in cell|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/granny-killer-found-dead-in-cell/2005/09/09/1125772681493.html|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=9 September 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924201827/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/granny-killer-found-dead-in-cell/2005/09/09/1125772681493.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In [[Gillian Armstrong]]'s ''[[Unfolding Florence: The Many Lives of Florence Broadhurst]]'', friends and employees of Broadhurst stated that they believed the killer may have been known to her and that the motive may have been financial. This was due to the presence of two cups of tea near her body, suggesting a meeting or appointment, and the killer's apparent knowledge of her factory's layout.\n\n== Wallpapers ==\nIn 1959 Broadhurst established Australian (Hand Printed) Wallpapers Pty Ltd., which later became Florence Broadhurst Wallpapers Pty Ltd, advertised as \"the only studio of its kind in the world\".<ref name =\"ADB\"/> Her brightly coloured geometric and nature-inspired oversized designs were all hand printed. Technical advances made in her studio included printing onto metallic surfaces, the development of a washable, vinyl-coating finish and a drying rack system that allowed her wallpapers to be produced in large quantities.<ref name =\"ADB\"/> By 1972, her wallpapers reportedly contained around 800 designs in eighty different colours,<ref name =\"ADB\"/> while by the mid-1970s she monopolised the quality end of the Australian market and was exporting worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|website=Signature Prints|url=http://www.signatureprints.com.au/aboutus/aboutus_flobro.html|title=Florence Broadhurst's Amazing Adventure|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210202407/http://www.signatureprints.com.au/aboutus/aboutus_flobro.html|archivedate=10 February 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nBroadhurst's library of wooden silk-printing screens and film positives was sold to Wilson Fabrics and Wallcoverings in 1978, just one year after her death. However, the decline of wallpaper as a popular form of home furnishing in the 1980s saw the collection languish, and it was later re-sold to Signature Prints Pty Ltd. Signature Prints in turn was purchased by a conglomerate led by current CEO David Lennie in 1989. Lennie had previously run a small wallpaper company in Auckland, New Zealand and briefly met Florence Broadhurst before her death.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Chee Soon & Fitzgerald, a tiny but influential Sydney design store, held the wholesale and retail distribution rights for Broadhurst wallpaper. This led to some popularity in Sydney design circles but little media attention. In the early 2000s, Signature Prints made a conscious decision to promote Broadhurst's designs overseas, specifically in the UK. This effort, coupled with an international resurgence of interest in wallpaper, greatly increased the designer's profile and led to distribution deals being struck for both the UK and the US in 2003.\n\nFive hundred and thirty Broadhurst designs are in the company's collection but only a small proportion are printed by the company as wallpaper and fabric. The company retains strict control over the designs and insists printing take place in its inner-city Sydney factory. Some licences have been granted for other uses, such as high-end fashion pieces by designers [[Akira Isogawa]], Nicky Zimmermann and [[Karen Walker (designer)|Karen Walker]]. In late 2008 a rug collection featuring ten Broadhurst designs was released in Australia and the US.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Cover-Story/Go-with-the-Flo/2004/11/10/1100021847779.html|date=10 November 2004|title=Go with the Flo|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818055830/http://www.smh.com.au/news/Cover-Story/Go-with-the-Flo/2004/11/10/1100021847779.html |archivedate=18 August 2006|accessdate=11 November 2004| work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>\nThe French swimwear company Vilebrequin released collection using a print by Florence Broadhurst for Father's Day 2019 titled \"Rabbits and Poodles.\" They cite her designs as being the \"perfect antidote to aging.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Florence Broadhurst |url=https://www.vilebrequin.com/us/en/browse-by-patterns-florence-broadhurst/ |website=Vilebrequin |accessdate=30 July 2019}}</ref>\n==See also==\n*[[List of Orientalist artists]]\n*[[List of unsolved murders (20th century)|List of unsolved murders]]\n*[[Orientalism]]\n* ''[[Unfolding Florence: The Many Lives of Florence Broadhurst]]'', a 2006 documentary/drama movie\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[[Gillian Armstrong]], ''[[Unfolding Florence: The Many Lives of Florence Broadhurst]]'', docu-drama, 2006\n*[[Helen O'Neill (journalist)|Helen O'Neill]], ''Florence Broadhurst: Her Secret and Extraordinary Lives'', 2006\n*Siobhan O'Brien, ''A Life By Design'', 2004\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/search_tags.php?tag=Broadhurst%2C+Florence&s=1 Florence Broadhurst items at the Powerhouse Museum]\n*[http://www.smh.com.au/news/design/florence-broadhursts-signature-style/2007/09/24/1205602648648.html Florence Broadhurst's Signature style]\n*[http://www.florencebroadhurst.com/designs-1/ Florence Broadhurst Website]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Broadhurst, Florence}}\n[[Category:1899 births]]\n[[Category:1970s murders in Australia]]\n[[Category:1977 crimes in Australia]]\n[[Category:1977 deaths]]\n[[Category:1977 murders in Oceania]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian painters]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian women artists]]\n[[Category:Australian designers]]\n[[Category:Australian murder victims]]\n[[Category:Australian women painters]]\n[[Category:Female murder victims]]\n[[Category:Murdered designers]]\n[[Category:Orientalist painters]]\n[[Category:People murdered in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Unsolved murders in Australia]]\n[[Category:19th-century Australian women]]\n", "name_user": "Chris.sherlock", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Broadhurst"}

There have been five films released so far in the series: ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982), ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988), ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]]'' (2008) and ''[[Rambo: Last Blood]]'' (2019). The films follow [[John Rambo]], a [[United States Army|US Army]] veteran played by [[Sylvester Stallone]], who is [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] by his experience in the [[Vietnam War]], and uses the skills he gained there to fight corrupt [[police officers]], [[front line|enemy troops]] and [[drug cartels]].\n\nThe franchise has its roots in the 1972 novel ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]'' by [[David Morrell]]. Stallone co-wrote the screenplays of all five films, and directed ''Rambo''.\n\nThe film series has grossed $819 million in total, with the most successful film, ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'', grossing $300 million.\n\nIn addition to films, the franchise also spawned an animated television series and a series of comic books, novels, video games and a [[Bollywood]] remake.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)<!--Do not change the way writers are credit.

In December 1981, Rambo travels to a small town in Washington (actually Hope, British Columbia, Canada), in search of a fellow U.S. Army [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] buddy. He learns that his friend died from cancer the previous summer due to exposure to [[Agent Orange]].\n\nHe attempts to find a diner in town, and maybe a temporary job. The overconfident town sheriff Will Teasle ([[Brian Dennehy]]) does not welcome Rambo, judging the military hero negatively because of his long hair and scruffy look. Rambo disobeys the sheriff's order to stay away from town, as he has done nothing wrong and believes such banishment to be a violation of his freedom of movement, and most of all he is hungry. Rambo returns to town soon afterwards and is promptly charged with vagrancy and subject to harassment from the deputies.\n\nThe harassment triggers flashbacks of Rambo's memories of his torture at the hands of the North Vietnamese when he was a prisoner of war. Rambo fights his way out of the sheriff's department with his bare hands and makes his way into the wilderness. A manhunt ensues, with the sheriff and his deputies all badly wounded. Rambo chooses not to kill any of them, but unintentionally kills a police officer in self-defense by throwing a rock at a helicopter, causing the pilot to lose control and an officer to fall out. The State Police and National Guard are called in.\n\nColonel Samuel Trautman ([[Richard Crenna]]), Rambo's former commanding officer, arrives. He suggests giving Rambo a chance to escape; if Rambo is allowed to slip away, he'll be given time to calm down and he can be arrested without incident. Teasle allows Trautman to contact Rambo through a stolen police radio, but Rambo refuses to surrender, stating that \"They (the deputies) drew first blood not me\" and then hangs up.\n\nThe authorities reject Trautman's recommendation for a wait-and-see attitude and continue the manhunt, and Rambo's subsequent rampage culminates in him returning to town with guns and bombs from a commandeered Army truck. This results in the destruction of the sheriff's office and more of the town's main street. Rambo stands poised to eliminate the sheriff, but Trautman finally confronts Rambo face-to-face, and ultimately convinces his former soldier to surrender to the authorities.\n\nBetween the first and second films, Rambo is convicted and remanded to a civilian maximum-security prison where hard labor is the norm. Despite being a convict, the rigid routine and discipline of prison life provides Rambo with some measure of much-needed stability, as it reminds him of his past in the military and its own rigid hierarchy.\n\n===''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' (1985)===\n{{Main|Rambo: First Blood Part II}}\nThe film opens with Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) offering Rambo his freedom if Rambo will return to Vietnam to search for American prisoners of war remaining in Vietnamese captivity. Marshall Murdock ([[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]]), the official in charge of the mission, is portrayed as a corrupt political figure who doesn't want to expose the truth. Rambo is not to engage the enemy and instead is ordered to take photographs of a North Vietnamese camp, the same camp he himself had been held prisoner in, to prove to the American public there are no more POWs in Vietnam, although Murdock knows that there are.\n\nRambo is flown into the country with the purpose of parachuting into the jungle, but a malfunction during his exit from the plane causes him to have to cut away much of his equipment. He then meets his in-country contact, anti-communist Vietnamese rebel Co Bao ([[Julia Nickson]]), who is serving as an intelligence agent. Rambo discovers that there are POWs being held in the camp where he was dropped and that POWs were rotated between camps. Rambo breaks one POW out of the camp and attempts to escape, only to be abandoned at the moment of a pick up by helicopter on a hilltop on the orders of Murdock, after which both he and the POW are recaptured by the Vietnamese soldiers. Rambo is immobilized in a pit of sewage and leeches, then tortured by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] soldiers, who are allied with the Vietnamese and training Vietnamese soldiers. Co enters the base under the guise of a prostitute for hire, where she aids Rambo in escaping. After Rambo expresses his deepest gratitude for his rescue, the two share a kiss, after Co implores him to take her back to America with him. As they prepare to move on, Co is shot by surprise gunfire.\n\nEnraged, Rambo then acts on his own initiative and starts a one-man war, hunting the Vietnamese and Soviet soldiers searching for him in the jungle and stealing a Soviet-captured helicopter. He flies the helicopter back to the camp, destroying it and killing the remaining Vietnamese and Soviet soldiers in the camp. He frees all the POWs and is pursued by a Soviet Mi-24 Hind helicopter. After destroying the Hind with an RPG, he returns to the US base in Thailand with all the POWs. Rambo is enraged at how the United States government has ignored the existence of surviving soldiers being held captive, and grabs an M-60 machine gun and proceeds into the headquarters building, destroying all of the electronic gear within. Rambo then threatens Murdock and tells him to be forthright with the American public regarding the truth of the POWs and to spare no expense in rescuing them all, or else he will return for Murdock. When Trautman says Rambo will be honored once again, he declines, saying the POWs deserve the accolades more. For his actions in Vietnam, Rambo is granted a [[presidential pardon]] and decides to remain in Thailand.\n\nBetween the second and third films, Rambo takes up residence near a monastery where he engages in frequent meditation to find a sense of inner peace. Although Rambo believes his soldiering days are apparently over, he does not become a complete pacifist, as he often participates in violent stick-fighting matches and donates his winnings to the monks to help renovate the monastery.\n\n===''Rambo III'' (1988)===\n{{Main|Rambo III}}\n[[File:\u05e1\u05d9\u05dc\u05d1\u05e1\u05d8\u05e8 \u05e1\u05d8\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4.jpg|thumb|upright|Stallone in ''[[Rambo III]]'']]\nThe film opens with Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) returning to [[Thailand]] to once again enlist Rambo's help. After witnessing Rambo's victory in a stick-fighting match, Trautman visits the temple Rambo is helping to build and asks him to join him on a mission to [[Afghanistan]]. This brings Rambo into the realm of the [[CIA]]'s [[Special Activities Division]] which primarily hires Army Special Forces soldiers. The mission is meant to supply weapons, including [[FIM-92 Stinger]] missiles, to Afghan freedom fighters, the [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|Mujahideen]], who are fighting the Soviets. Despite having been shown photos of civilians suffering under Soviet rule, Rambo refuses and Trautman chooses to go on his own.\n\nWhile in Afghanistan, Trautman's troops are ambushed by Soviet troops while passing through the mountains at night. Trautman is imprisoned in a Soviet base and tortured for information by commanding officer Zaysen (Marc de Jonge) and his henchman Kourov (Randy Raney). Rambo learns of the incident from embassy field officer Robert Griggs ([[Kurtwood Smith]]) and immediately flies to Pakistan where he meets up with Mousa (Sasson Gabai), a weapons supplier who agrees to take him to a village deep in the Afghan desert, close to the Soviet base where Trautman is kept. The Mujahideen in the village are already hesitant to help Rambo in the first place, but are convinced not to help him when their village is attacked by Soviet helicopters after one of Mousa's shop assistants informed the Russians of Rambo's presence. Aided only by Mousa and a young boy named Hamid (Doudi Shoua), Rambo makes his way to the Soviet base and starts his attempts to free Trautman. The first attempt is unsuccessful and results in Hamid getting shot in the leg, and Rambo himself getting hit by wooden shrapnel. After escaping from the base, Rambo tends to Hamid's wounds and sends him and Mousa away to safety.\n\nThe next day, Rambo returns to the base once again, just in time to rescue Trautman from being tortured with a flamethrower.  After rescuing several other prisoners, Rambo steals a helicopter and escapes from the base. The helicopter crashes and Rambo and Trautman are forced to continue on foot. After a confrontation in a cave, where Rambo and Trautman kill several Russian soldiers including Kourov, they are confronted by an entire army of Russian tanks, headed by Zaysen. Just as they are about to be overwhelmed by the might of the Soviet Army, the Mujahideen warriors, together with Mousa and Hamid, ride onto the battlefield in a cavalry charge, overwhelming the Russians despite their numerical and technological superiority. In the ensuing battle, in which both Trautman and Rambo are wounded, Rambo manages to kill Zaysen by driving a tank into the helicopter in which Zaysen is flying.\n\nAt the end of the battle Rambo and Trautman say goodbye to their Mujahideen friends and leave Afghanistan to go home.\n\nBetween the third and fourth films, Rambo still lives in Thailand, making a meager living as a snake catcher and by providing boat rides.\n\n===''Rambo'' (2008)===\n{{Main|Rambo (2008 film)}} \nThe film opens with news footage of the [[Saffron Revolution|crisis in Burma]]. Burma (also known as Myanmar) is under the iron fist rule of [[Than Shwe]] and takes harsher stances against the nation's pro-democracy movement. Rebels are thrown into a mine-infested marsh and then gunned down by a Burmese army unit, overseen by Major Pa Tee Tint.\n\nFormer U.S. soldier John Rambo still lives in [[Thailand]], now residing in a village near the Burmese border and makes a living capturing snakes and selling them in a nearby village. A missionary, Michael Burnett ([[Paul Schulze]]), asks Rambo to take him and his associates down the [[Salween River]] to Burma on a humanitarian mission to help the [[Karen people]]. Rambo initially refuses but is convinced by another missionary in the group, Sarah Miller ([[Julie Benz]]), to take them.\n\nThe boat is stopped by pirates who demand Sarah in exchange for passage. After taking advantage of the pirates' complacency, Rambo kills them all. Although his actions save the missionaries, it greatly disturbs them. Upon arrival, Michael says that they will travel by road and will not need Rambo's help for the return trip. The mission goes well until the Burmese army, led by Major Tint, attacks the village, killing most of the villagers and two missionaries, and capturing the rest. When the missionaries fail to come back after ten days, their pastor, Arthur Marsh ([[Ken Howard]]), comes to Rambo to ask for his help in guiding hired mercenaries to the village where the missionaries were last seen.\n\nTroubled by Sarah's potential fate, Rambo decides to accompany the soldiers. After seeing the destroyed village filled with mutilated humans and animals, the mercenaries spot some soldiers forcing several surviving villagers to run through a minefield. The mercenaries are hesitant to rescue the villagers, but not Rambo, who shoots the soldiers with a bow and arrow. Rambo reminds his colleagues of the rescue mission and encourages the team to move on. Hijacking a truck, they create a plan to save the hostages at the P.O.W. camp, doing so within fifteen minutes to avoid alerting the army. Rambo helps Sarah and the others to escape.\n\nThe [[Myanmar Armed Forces|Burmese Army (Tatmadaw)]] unit finds their hostages missing and organizes a massive manhunt. Everyone except for Rambo, Sarah, and \"School Boy\" ([[Matthew Marsden]]), the mercenary team's sniper, is captured. Just as the group is to be executed, Rambo hijacks a truck-mounted .50-caliber machine gun and engages the Burmese army. A group of [[Karen people|Karen rebels]] joins the fight to help Rambo and the mercenaries defeat the Burmese unit. Seeing that the battle is lost, Major Tint decides to flee, only to run into Rambo's machete, which Rambo then uses to disembowel the Major.\n\nEncouraged by Sarah's words, Rambo returns to the [[United States]]. The last scene shows him walking along a rural highway, past a horse farm and a rusted mailbox with the name \"R. Rambo\" on it. He makes his way down the gravel driveway as the credits roll.\n\n===''Rambo: Last Blood'' (2019)===\n{{main|Rambo: Last Blood}}\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nEleven years [[Rambo (2008 film)|after the events in Burma]], [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[John Rambo]] lives in [[Bowie, Arizona]] at his deceased father's horse ranch, which he manages with his old friend, Maria Beltran, and her granddaughter, Gabriela. Gabriela tells Rambo that a friend of hers, Gizelle, has found Gabriela's biological father, Miguel, in [[Mexico]]. Both Rambo and Maria tell her not to go to Mexico, but Gabriela secretly drives her old [[Honda Civic]] there to ask Miguel why he abandoned her and her mother years ago. Gizelle leads Gabriela to Miguel's apartment, where he coldly tells her that he never really cared for Gabriela or her mother.\n \nGizelle takes a heartbroken Gabriela to a nearby club, where Gabriela is drugged and kidnapped by the enforcers of a blood-thirsty [[Mexican cartel]] that engages in ruthless [[sex trafficking]]. Meanwhile, Maria informs Rambo of Gabriela's disappearance in Mexico. Rambo rushes to Mexico and interrogates both Miguel and Gizelle about Gabriela's whereabouts. Gizelle reluctantly leads Rambo to the club where Gabriela was last seen and confronts El Flaco, the man who last spoke with Gabriela. A mysterious woman, Carmen Delgado, tails Rambo as El Flaco leads him to Gabriela's location. Rambo is immediately confronted, beaten and marked by the cartel, led by the brothers Hugo and Victor Martinez. They take his driver's license with the location of Rambo's ranch and a photo of Gabriela, whom Victor recognizes. The cartel vow to mistreat Gabriela further due to Rambo's actions.\n\nCarmen takes Rambo back to her home where she cares for him until he fully recovers after four days. While Rambo is cared for by Carmen, Gabriela is stripped and consistently dosed with heroin and sold to be raped repeatedly. Carmen says she is an [[Freelancer|independent]] journalist who has been investigating the Martinez brothers, who kidnapped and murdered her sister. Rambo later raids one of the brothels, killing several men until he finds a drugged Gabriela. While driving back home in his pickup, Rambo thanks Gabriela for giving him hope for ten years but she dies from the forced overdose. An enraged Rambo sends Maria away and rigs the ranch with traps for a confrontation, and later returns to Mexico to ask Carmen's help in finding Victor. Carmen initially refuses and tells Rambo that it will solve nothing, but is convinced after he appeals to her grief and frustration.\n\nRambo raids Victor's home, killing several guards and decapitating Victor. In retaliation, Hugo leads a group of hitmen to Rambo's ranch, where each falls victim to the rigged traps. Saving Hugo for the last, Rambo mutilates him and rips his heart out, killing him instantly. In the aftermath, a weakened Rambo sits on the porch of his father's house, vowing to continue fighting and keep the memories of his loved ones alive. During the credits, flashbacks to scenes from the first four movies in the franchise are shown, with Rambo finally saddling up his horse and riding off into the sunset.\n\n==Future==\nDuring Cannes 2019, Stallone said he would continue portraying Rambo if the fifth film succeeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/stallone-would-return-as-rambo-if-last-blood-is-a-hit|title= Stallone happy to return as Rambo if Last Blood is a hit|first=Mike|last=Sprague|date=June 12, 2019|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|access-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref> Grunberg, however, said that ''Rambo: Last Blood'' \"closes the circle\", hoping it would conclude the film series.<ref name=\"Total Film\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/rambo-5-last-blood-director-adrian-grunberg-interview/|title= Exclusive: Rambo: Last Blood director discusses bringing back Sylvester Stallone's action hero: \"This movie closes the circle\"|author=Jack Shepherd, James Mottram|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2019, Stallone confirmed that he has plans for a prequel to the series; although he would not reprise the title role, he would like to explore who Rambo was before the war: {{blockquote|I always thought of Rambo when he was 16 or 17\u2014I hope they can do the prequel\u2014he was the best person you could find.

The music from the first and second films was performed by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the music from the third by the Hungarian State Opera Orchestra. Goldsmith's main theme for ''Rambo'' was the basis for the end title song \"It's a Long Road\", performed by [[Dan Hill]], part of the ''First Blood'' soundtrack.\n\nThe music for the first film is harsher and more dissonant than that for the sequels, as is keeping with the tone of the film. As such, it bears more of a resemblance to Goldsmith's output of the 1960s and 1970s than it does most of his work in the 1980s. The first film's score does use electronics but is primarily orchestral while the sequel scores incorporate heavier use of electronics. The second film's score is the most popular, being that it is the most exciting. The music in the third film is an extension of the style used in the second, but with a few new themes. Both sequels feature new themes for Rambo that are based on elements found in the original \"It's a Long Road\" theme, which is also heard in its original form in each film as well.\n\nBecause Goldsmith died in 2004, film composer [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]] (''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' and ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'') scored the fourth film. He reassured fans at the time of Goldsmith's death that his score would be based on Goldsmith's cues for the first three films.\n\nThe 2008 film, ''Rambo'', was advertised with [[Drowning Pool]]'s \"[[Bodies (Drowning Pool song)|Bodies]]\" and features two songs in the film written and performed by [[Jake La Botz]], who portrays the mercenary \"Reese\" in the film.\n\nThe theme music for 1986 animated TV series, ''Rambo: The Force of Freedom'' came from a Jerry Goldsmith's scores for ''First Blood'' and ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' were licensed for use in the series and tracked throughout (mostly from ''Rambo: First Blood Part II''), with his music for the film's trailer for ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'', used as the opening and closing themes. It was supplemented by original music composed by [[Haim Saban]] and [[Shuki Levy]], who received an \"additional music by\" credit.\n\nSoundtracks with music from the films were also released. The soundtracks for ''First Blood'', ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'', ''Rambo'' and ''Rambo: Last Blood'' are available on [[iTunes]]. However, the soundtrack for ''Rambo III'' is not available on iTunes. For more on the music of the ''Rambo'' franchise, see the \"Music\" section below.\n\n==Home media==\nAll five existing films in the ''Rambo'' franchise are available from [[Lionsgate]] by virtue of the studio's output deal with [[StudioCanal]] (the company that currently holds the underlying rights to the first three films) and Lionsgate itself co-producing the latter film (in partnership with [[The Weinstein Company]]). [[Paramount Pictures]] (via [[Trifecta Entertainment and Media]]) holds the television rights to the first three films, while [[Debmar-Mercury]] handles television distribution for the latter film on behalf of parent company Lionsgate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

There have been five films released so far in the series: ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982), ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988), ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]]'' (2008) and ''[[Rambo: Last Blood]]'' (2019). The films follow [[John Rambo]], a [[United States Army|US Army]] veteran played by [[Sylvester Stallone]], who is [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] by his experience in the [[Vietnam War]], and uses the skills he gained there to fight corrupt [[police officers]], [[front line|enemy troops]] and [[drug cartels]].\n\nThe franchise has its roots in the 1972 novel ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]'' by [[David Morrell]]. Stallone co-wrote the screenplays of all five films, and directed ''Rambo''.\n\nThe film series has grossed $819 million in total, with the most successful film, ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'', grossing $300 million.\n\nIn addition to films, the franchise also spawned an animated television series and a series of comic books, novels, video games and a [[Bollywood]] remake.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)<!--Do not change the way writers are credit.

In December 1981, Rambo travels to a small town in Washington (actually Hope, British Columbia, Canada), in search of a fellow U.S. Army [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] buddy. He learns that his friend died from cancer the previous summer due to exposure to [[Agent Orange]].\n\nHe attempts to find a diner in town, and maybe a temporary job. The overconfident town sheriff Will Teasle ([[Brian Dennehy]]) does not welcome Rambo, judging the military hero negatively because of his long hair and scruffy look. Rambo disobeys the sheriff's order to stay away from town, as he has done nothing wrong and believes such banishment to be a violation of his freedom of movement, and most of all he is hungry. Rambo returns to town soon afterwards and is promptly charged with vagrancy and subject to harassment from the deputies.\n\nThe harassment triggers flashbacks of Rambo's memories of his torture at the hands of the North Vietnamese when he was a prisoner of war. Rambo fights his way out of the sheriff's department with his bare hands and makes his way into the wilderness. A manhunt ensues, with the sheriff and his deputies all badly wounded. Rambo chooses not to kill any of them, but unintentionally kills a police officer in self-defense by throwing a rock at a helicopter, causing the pilot to lose control and an officer to fall out. The State Police and National Guard are called in.\n\nColonel Samuel Trautman ([[Richard Crenna]]), Rambo's former commanding officer, arrives. He suggests giving Rambo a chance to escape; if Rambo is allowed to slip away, he'll be given time to calm down and he can be arrested without incident. Teasle allows Trautman to contact Rambo through a stolen police radio, but Rambo refuses to surrender, stating that \"They (the deputies) drew first blood not me\" and then hangs up.\n\nThe authorities reject Trautman's recommendation for a wait-and-see attitude and continue the manhunt, and Rambo's subsequent rampage culminates in him returning to town with guns and bombs from a commandeered Army truck. This results in the destruction of the sheriff's office and more of the town's main street. Rambo stands poised to eliminate the sheriff, but Trautman finally confronts Rambo face-to-face, and ultimately convinces his former soldier to surrender to the authorities.\n\nBetween the first and second films, Rambo is convicted and remanded to a civilian maximum-security prison where hard labor is the norm. Despite being a convict, the rigid routine and discipline of prison life provides Rambo with some measure of much-needed stability, as it reminds him of his past in the military and its own rigid hierarchy.\n\n===''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' (1985)===\n{{Main|Rambo: First Blood Part II}}\nThe film opens with Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) offering Rambo his freedom if Rambo will return to Vietnam to search for American prisoners of war remaining in Vietnamese captivity. Marshall Murdock ([[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]]), the official in charge of the mission, is portrayed as a corrupt political figure who doesn't want to expose the truth. Rambo is not to engage the enemy and instead is ordered to take photographs of a North Vietnamese camp, the same camp he himself had been held prisoner in, to prove to the American public there are no more POWs in Vietnam, although Murdock knows that there are.\n\nRambo is flown into the country with the purpose of parachuting into the jungle, but a malfunction during his exit from the plane causes him to have to cut away much of his equipment. He then meets his in-country contact, anti-communist Vietnamese rebel Co Bao ([[Julia Nickson]]), who is serving as an intelligence agent. Rambo discovers that there are POWs being held in the camp where he was dropped and that POWs were rotated between camps. Rambo breaks one POW out of the camp and attempts to escape, only to be abandoned at the moment of a pick up by helicopter on a hilltop on the orders of Murdock, after which both he and the POW are recaptured by the Vietnamese soldiers. Rambo is immobilized in a pit of sewage and leeches, then tortured by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] soldiers, who are allied with the Vietnamese and training Vietnamese soldiers. Co enters the base under the guise of a prostitute for hire, where she aids Rambo in escaping. After Rambo expresses his deepest gratitude for his rescue, the two share a kiss, after Co implores him to take her back to America with him. As they prepare to move on, Co is shot by surprise gunfire.\n\nEnraged, Rambo then acts on his own initiative and starts a one-man war, hunting the Vietnamese and Soviet soldiers searching for him in the jungle and stealing a Soviet-captured helicopter. He flies the helicopter back to the camp, destroying it and killing the remaining Vietnamese and Soviet soldiers in the camp. He frees all the POWs and is pursued by a Soviet Mi-24 Hind helicopter. After destroying the Hind with an RPG, he returns to the US base in Thailand with all the POWs. Rambo is enraged at how the United States government has ignored the existence of surviving soldiers being held captive, and grabs an M-60 machine gun and proceeds into the headquarters building, destroying all of the electronic gear within. Rambo then threatens Murdock and tells him to be forthright with the American public regarding the truth of the POWs and to spare no expense in rescuing them all, or else he will return for Murdock. When Trautman says Rambo will be honored once again, he declines, saying the POWs deserve the accolades more. For his actions in Vietnam, Rambo is granted a [[presidential pardon]] and decides to remain in Thailand.\n\nBetween the second and third films, Rambo takes up residence near a monastery where he engages in frequent meditation to find a sense of inner peace. Although Rambo believes his soldiering days are apparently over, he does not become a complete pacifist, as he often participates in violent stick-fighting matches and donates his winnings to the monks to help renovate the monastery.\n\n===''Rambo III'' (1988)===\n{{Main|Rambo III}}\n[[File:\u05e1\u05d9\u05dc\u05d1\u05e1\u05d8\u05e8 \u05e1\u05d8\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4.jpg|thumb|upright|Stallone in ''[[Rambo III]]'']]\nThe film opens with Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) returning to [[Thailand]] to once again enlist Rambo's help. After witnessing Rambo's victory in a stick-fighting match, Trautman visits the temple Rambo is helping to build and asks him to join him on a mission to [[Afghanistan]]. This brings Rambo into the realm of the [[CIA]]'s [[Special Activities Division]] which primarily hires Army Special Forces soldiers. The mission is meant to supply weapons, including [[FIM-92 Stinger]] missiles, to Afghan freedom fighters, the [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|Mujahideen]], who are fighting the Soviets. Despite having been shown photos of civilians suffering under Soviet rule, Rambo refuses and Trautman chooses to go on his own.\n\nWhile in Afghanistan, Trautman's troops are ambushed by Soviet troops while passing through the mountains at night. Trautman is imprisoned in a Soviet base and tortured for information by commanding officer Zaysen (Marc de Jonge) and his henchman Kourov (Randy Raney). Rambo learns of the incident from embassy field officer Robert Griggs ([[Kurtwood Smith]]) and immediately flies to Pakistan where he meets up with Mousa (Sasson Gabai), a weapons supplier who agrees to take him to a village deep in the Afghan desert, close to the Soviet base where Trautman is kept. The Mujahideen in the village are already hesitant to help Rambo in the first place, but are convinced not to help him when their village is attacked by Soviet helicopters after one of Mousa's shop assistants informed the Russians of Rambo's presence. Aided only by Mousa and a young boy named Hamid (Doudi Shoua), Rambo makes his way to the Soviet base and starts his attempts to free Trautman. The first attempt is unsuccessful and results in Hamid getting shot in the leg, and Rambo himself getting hit by wooden shrapnel. After escaping from the base, Rambo tends to Hamid's wounds and sends him and Mousa away to safety.\n\nThe next day, Rambo returns to the base once again, just in time to rescue Trautman from being tortured with a flamethrower.  After rescuing several other prisoners, Rambo steals a helicopter and escapes from the base. The helicopter crashes and Rambo and Trautman are forced to continue on foot. After a confrontation in a cave, where Rambo and Trautman kill several Russian soldiers including Kourov, they are confronted by an entire army of Russian tanks, headed by Zaysen. Just as they are about to be overwhelmed by the might of the Soviet Army, the Mujahideen warriors, together with Mousa and Hamid, ride onto the battlefield in a cavalry charge, overwhelming the Russians despite their numerical and technological superiority. In the ensuing battle, in which both Trautman and Rambo are wounded, Rambo manages to kill Zaysen by driving a tank into the helicopter in which Zaysen is flying.\n\nAt the end of the battle Rambo and Trautman say goodbye to their Mujahideen friends and leave Afghanistan to go home.\n\nBetween the third and fourth films, Rambo still lives in Thailand, making a meager living as a snake catcher and by providing boat rides.\n\n===''Rambo'' (2008)===\n{{Main|Rambo (2008 film)}} \nThe film opens with news footage of the [[Saffron Revolution|crisis in Burma]]. Burma (also known as Myanmar) is under the iron fist rule of [[Than Shwe]] and takes harsher stances against the nation's pro-democracy movement. Rebels are thrown into a mine-infested marsh and then gunned down by a Burmese army unit, overseen by Major Pa Tee Tint.\n\nFormer U.S. soldier John Rambo still lives in [[Thailand]], now residing in a village near the Burmese border and makes a living capturing snakes and selling them in a nearby village. A missionary, Michael Burnett ([[Paul Schulze]]), asks Rambo to take him and his associates down the [[Salween River]] to Burma on a humanitarian mission to help the [[Karen people]]. Rambo initially refuses but is convinced by another missionary in the group, Sarah Miller ([[Julie Benz]]), to take them.\n\nThe boat is stopped by pirates who demand Sarah in exchange for passage. After taking advantage of the pirates' complacency, Rambo kills them all. Although his actions save the missionaries, it greatly disturbs them. Upon arrival, Michael says that they will travel by road and will not need Rambo's help for the return trip. The mission goes well until the Burmese army, led by Major Tint, attacks the village, killing most of the villagers and two missionaries, and capturing the rest. When the missionaries fail to come back after ten days, their pastor, Arthur Marsh ([[Ken Howard]]), comes to Rambo to ask for his help in guiding hired mercenaries to the village where the missionaries were last seen.\n\nTroubled by Sarah's potential fate, Rambo decides to accompany the soldiers. After seeing the destroyed village filled with mutilated humans and animals, the mercenaries spot some soldiers forcing several surviving villagers to run through a minefield. The mercenaries are hesitant to rescue the villagers, but not Rambo, who shoots the soldiers with a bow and arrow. Rambo reminds his colleagues of the rescue mission and encourages the team to move on. Hijacking a truck, they create a plan to save the hostages at the P.O.W. camp, doing so within fifteen minutes to avoid alerting the army. Rambo helps Sarah and the others to escape.\n\nThe [[Myanmar Armed Forces|Burmese Army (Tatmadaw)]] unit finds their hostages missing and organizes a massive manhunt. Everyone except for Rambo, Sarah, and \"School Boy\" ([[Matthew Marsden]]), the mercenary team's sniper, is captured. Just as the group is to be executed, Rambo hijacks a truck-mounted .50-caliber machine gun and engages the Burmese army. A group of [[Karen people|Karen rebels]] joins the fight to help Rambo and the mercenaries defeat the Burmese unit. Seeing that the battle is lost, Major Tint decides to flee, only to run into Rambo's machete, which Rambo then uses to disembowel the Major.\n\nEncouraged by Sarah's words, Rambo returns to the [[United States]]. The last scene shows him walking along a rural highway, past a horse farm and a rusted mailbox with the name \"R. Rambo\" on it. He makes his way down the gravel driveway as the credits roll.\n\n===''Rambo: Last Blood'' (2019)===\n{{main|Rambo: Last Blood}}\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nEleven years [[Rambo (2008 film)|after the events in Burma]], [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[John Rambo]] lives in [[Bowie, Arizona]] at his deceased father's horse ranch, which he manages with his old friend, Maria Beltran, and her granddaughter, Gabriela. Gabriela tells Rambo that a friend of hers, Gizelle, has found Gabriela's biological father, Miguel, in [[Mexico]]. Both Rambo and Maria tell her not to go to Mexico, but Gabriela secretly drives there to ask Miguel why he abandoned her and her mother years ago. Gizelle leads Gabriela to Miguel's apartment, where he coldly tells her that he never really cared for Gabriela or her mother.\n \nGizelle takes a heartbroken Gabriela to a nearby club, where Gabriela is drugged and kidnapped by the enforcers of a [[Mexican cartel]]. Meanwhile, Maria informs Rambo of Gabriela's disappearance in Mexico. Rambo rushes to Mexico and interrogates both Miguel and Gizelle about Gabriela's whereabouts. Gizelle reluctantly leads Rambo to the club where Gabriela was last seen and confronts El Flaco, the man who last spoke with Gabriela. A mysterious woman, Carmen Delgado, tails Rambo as El Flaco leads him to Gabriela's location. Rambo is immediately confronted, beaten and marked by the cartel, led by the brothers Hugo and Victor Martinez. They take his driver's license with the location of Rambo's ranch and a photo of Gabriela, whom Victor recognizes. The cartel vow to mistreat Gabriela further due to Rambo's actions.\n\nCarmen takes Rambo back to her home where she cares for him until he fully recovers after four days. While Rambo is cared for by Carmen, Gabriela is stripped and consistently dosed with heroin and sold to be raped repeatedly. Carmen says she is an [[Freelancer|independent]] journalist who has been investigating the Martinez brothers, who kidnapped and murdered her sister. Rambo later raids one of the brothels, killing several men until he finds a drugged Gabriela. While driving back home in his pickup, Rambo thanks Gabriela for giving him hope for ten years but she dies from the forced overdose. An enraged Rambo sends Maria away and rigs the ranch with traps for a confrontation, and later returns to Mexico to ask Carmen's help in finding Victor. Carmen initially refuses and tells Rambo that it will solve nothing, but is convinced after he appeals to her grief and frustration.\n\nRambo raids Victor's home, killing several guards and decapitating Victor. In retaliation, Hugo leads a group of hitmen to Rambo's ranch, where each falls victim to the rigged traps. Saving Hugo for the last, Rambo mutilates him and rips his heart out, killing him instantly. In the aftermath, a weakened Rambo sits on the porch of his father's house, vowing to continue fighting and keep the memories of his loved ones alive. During the credits, flashbacks to scenes from the first four movies in the franchise are shown, with Rambo finally saddling up his horse and riding off into the sunset.\n\n==Future==\nDuring Cannes 2019, Stallone said he would continue portraying Rambo if the fifth film succeeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/stallone-would-return-as-rambo-if-last-blood-is-a-hit|title= Stallone happy to return as Rambo if Last Blood is a hit|first=Mike|last=Sprague|date=June 12, 2019|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|access-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref> Grunberg, however, said that ''Rambo: Last Blood'' \"closes the circle\", hoping it would conclude the film series.<ref name=\"Total Film\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/rambo-5-last-blood-director-adrian-grunberg-interview/|title= Exclusive: Rambo: Last Blood director discusses bringing back Sylvester Stallone's action hero: \"This movie closes the circle\"|author=Jack Shepherd, James Mottram|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2019, Stallone confirmed that he has plans for a prequel to the series; although he would not reprise the title role, he would like to explore who Rambo was before the war: {{blockquote|I always thought of Rambo when he was 16 or 17\u2014I hope they can do the prequel\u2014he was the best person you could find.

The music from the first and second films was performed by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the music from the third by the Hungarian State Opera Orchestra. Goldsmith's main theme for ''Rambo'' was the basis for the end title song \"It's a Long Road\", performed by [[Dan Hill]], part of the ''First Blood'' soundtrack.\n\nThe music for the first film is harsher and more dissonant than that for the sequels, as is keeping with the tone of the film. As such, it bears more of a resemblance to Goldsmith's output of the 1960s and 1970s than it does most of his work in the 1980s. The first film's score does use electronics but is primarily orchestral while the sequel scores incorporate heavier use of electronics. The second film's score is the most popular, being that it is the most exciting. The music in the third film is an extension of the style used in the second, but with a few new themes. Both sequels feature new themes for Rambo that are based on elements found in the original \"It's a Long Road\" theme, which is also heard in its original form in each film as well.\n\nBecause Goldsmith died in 2004, film composer [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]] (''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' and ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'') scored the fourth film. He reassured fans at the time of Goldsmith's death that his score would be based on Goldsmith's cues for the first three films.\n\nThe 2008 film, ''Rambo'', was advertised with [[Drowning Pool]]'s \"[[Bodies (Drowning Pool song)|Bodies]]\" and features two songs in the film written and performed by [[Jake La Botz]], who portrays the mercenary \"Reese\" in the film.\n\nThe theme music for 1986 animated TV series, ''Rambo: The Force of Freedom'' came from a Jerry Goldsmith's scores for ''First Blood'' and ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' were licensed for use in the series and tracked throughout (mostly from ''Rambo: First Blood Part II''), with his music for the film's trailer for ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'', used as the opening and closing themes. It was supplemented by original music composed by [[Haim Saban]] and [[Shuki Levy]], who received an \"additional music by\" credit.\n\nSoundtracks with music from the films were also released. The soundtracks for ''First Blood'', ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'', ''Rambo'' and ''Rambo: Last Blood'' are available on [[iTunes]]. However, the soundtrack for ''Rambo III'' is not available on iTunes.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow deeply into the soil (1 to 2 [[Chi (unit)|chi]]). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deeply would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pests Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nBeginning in 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] began to report excessive production of grains because of pressure from above to succeed. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 [[Tonne|tonnes]] from 1957 to 1961.<ref name=\":15\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref>\n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains.

Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref name=\"Yang\">{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine.

By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi.

Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\n{{see also|1958 Yellow River flood}}\n[[File:Luokou yellow river bridge visit zhou enlai 1958.jpg|thumb|Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] (center front) visited Luokou Yellow River Bridge during the 1958 Yellow River flood.<ref name=\":16\" />]]\nIn 1958, there was a notable regional [[1958 Yellow River flood|flood of the Yellow River]] which affected part of [[Henan Province]] and [[Shandong Province]].<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/wxzl/wxzl/2000-12/26/content_1671.htm|title=\u5173\u4e8e\u9ec4\u6cb3\u3001\u957f\u6c5f\u3001\u6dee\u6cb3\u3001\u6c38\u5b9a\u6cb3\u9632\u5fa1\u7279\u5927\u6d2a\u6c34\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff08\u6458\u8981\uff09_\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u5927\u7f51|website=www.npc.gov.cn|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2007-06/14/content_648957.htm|title=\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u505a\u597d\u9ec4\u6cb3\u9632\u6c5b\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f55\u4e0d\u80fd\u6389\u4ee5\u8f7b\u5fc3\uff1f|last=|first=|date=|website=The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://guoqing.china.com.cn/zhuanti/2017-07/13/content_41210848.htm|title=\u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u6c34\u707e\u6709\u54ea\u4e9b\uff1f_\u4e2d\u56fd\u7f51|last=|first=|date=|website=[[China Internet Information Center]]|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tongji.cnki.net/kns55/Navi/result.aspx?id=N2007080101&file=N2007080101000094&floor=1|title=\u7b2c\u516d\u8282 1958\u5e74\u9ec4\u6cb3\u6d2a\u6c34-\u300a\u4e2d\u56fd\u707e\u60c5\u62a5\u544a1949-1995\u300b-\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u5e93|last=|first=|date=|website=tongji.cnki.net|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref name=\":17\">{{Cite web|url=http://newpaper.dahe.cn/jrab/html/2009-07/13/content_199329.htm|title=1958\u5e74\u9ec4\u6cb3\u5927\u6c34\u707e\u7eaa\u5b9e|last=|first=|date=|website=newpaper.dahe.cn|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newpaper.dahe.cn/jrab/html/2009-07/20/content_201822.htm|title=\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u4e94\u6b21\u9ec4\u6cb3\u6c34\u707e|last=|first=|date=|website=newpaper.dahe.cn|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> It was reported as the most severe flood of [[Yellow River]] since 1933.<ref name=\"dahe1\" /><ref name=\"dahe\">{{Cite web|url=http://newpaper.dahe.cn/jrab/html/2009-07/20/content_201822.htm|title=\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u4e94\u6b21\u9ec4\u6cb3\u6c34\u707e|last=|first=|date=|website=newpaper.dahe.cn|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> In July 1958, the Yellow River flood affected 741,000 people in 1708 villages and inundated over 3.04 million [[Mu (unit of area)|mu]] (over half a million [[Acre|acres]]) of cultivated fields.<ref name=\"dahe1\">{{Cite web|url=http://newpaper.dahe.cn/jrab/html/2009-07/13/content_199329.htm|title=1958\u5e74\u9ec4\u6cb3\u5927\u6c34\u707e\u7eaa\u5b9e|last=|first=|date=|website=newpaper.dahe.cn|language=zh|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> The largest torrent of the flood was smoothly directed into the [[Bohai Sea]] on July 27, and the government declared a \"victory over the flood\" after sending a rescue team of over 2 million people.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://politics.people.com.cn/GB/8198/54051/54053/3757306.html|title=\u9ec4\u6cb3\u9632\u6d2a\u6982\u8ff0|last=|first=|date=2005|website=politics.people.com.cn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> The spokesperson of the Flood Prevention Center of Chinese government stated on July 27, 1958, that:<ref name=\":17\" /><blockquote>This year we defeated the large flood without division of torrents or [[Dam failure|breaks on dams]], which secures the big harvest of the crops.

This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields.

errors. In June 1981, however, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) officially changed the name to \"Three Years of Difficulty\", and stated that the famine was mainly due to the mistakes of the Great Leap Forward as well as the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], in addition to some natural disasters and the [[Sino-Soviet split]].<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> Academic studies on the Great Chinese Famine also became more active in [[mainland China]] after 1980, with the government beginning to release some demographic data to the public.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/indepth/2009/09/090924_china60_yangjisheng|title=\u4e00\u6bb5\u4e0d\u5bb9\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5386\u53f2\uff1a\u5927\u9965\u8352|work=BBC News \u4e2d\u6587|access-date=2020-04-22|language=zh-CN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Gene Hsin|last2=Wen|first2=Guanzhong James|date=1997|title=Communal Dining and the Chinese Famine of 1958\u20131961|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/452319|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|volume=46|issue=1|pages=1\u201334|doi=10.1086/452319|issn=0013-0079}}</ref>  \n\nResearchers outside China have argued that the massive institutional and policy changes which accompanied the [[Great Leap Forward]] were the key factors in the famine, or at least worsened nature-induced disasters.<ref>{{cite video|title=China: A Century of Revolution|date=1997|people=Sue Williams (director), Howard Sharp (editor), [[Will Lyman]] (narrator)|publisher=WinStar Home Entertainment}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Population|volume=1|pages=388\u2013390|year=2003|editor-last=Demeny|editor-first=Paul|contribution=Famine in China|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan Reference|editor2-last=McNicoll|editor2-first=Geoffrey}}</ref> In particular, Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]] puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of [[democracy]] is the major culprit: \"Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country\u2014no matter how poor.\" He adds that it is \"hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow deeply into the soil (1 to 2 [[Chi (unit)|chi]]). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deeply would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pests Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nBeginning in 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] began to report excessive production of grains because of pressure from above to succeed. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 [[Tonne|tonnes]] from 1957 to 1961.<ref name=\":15\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref>\n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains. On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref name=\"Yang\">{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country.

Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party.

The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well.

In 1909, [[Thomas Common]] translated it as \"Superman\", following the terminology of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1903 stage play ''[[Man and Superman]]''. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] lambasted this translation in the 1950s for two reasons: first, the failure of the English prefix \"super\" to capture the nuance of the German {{lang|de|[[\u00fcber]]}} (though in Latin, its meaning of \"above\" or \"beyond\" is closer to the German); and second, for promoting misidentification of Nietzsche's concept with the comic-book character [[Superman]]. Kaufmann and others preferred to translate {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as \"overman the loser\". A better translation like \"superior humans\" might better fit the concept of Nietzsche as he unfolds his narrative. Scholars continue to employ both terms, some simply opting to reproduce the German word.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lampert|first=Laurence|title=Nietzsche's Teaching|location=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1986}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stanley|title=The Mask of Enlightenment|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}</ref>\n\nThe German prefix {{lang|de|[[\u00fcber]]}} can have connotations of superiority, transcendence, excessiveness, or intensity, depending on the words to which it is attached.<ref>''Duden Deutsches Universal W\u00f6rterbuch A\u2013Z,'' s.v. \u00fcber-.</ref> ''Mensch'' refers to a human being, rather than a male specifically.

Retrieved from http://en.pons.eu/german-english/%C3%BCbermenschlich.</ref>\n\n==This-worldliness==\nNietzsche introduces the concept of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} in contrast to his understanding of the other-worldliness of [[Christianity]]: Zarathustra proclaims the will of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to give meaning to life on earth, and admonishes his audience to ignore those who promise other-worldly fulfillment to draw them away from the earth.<ref>Hollingdale, R. J. (1961), page 44 \u2013 English translation of Zarathustra's prologue; \"I love those who do not first seek beyond the stars for reasons to go down and to be sacrifices: but who sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth may one day belong to the Superman\"</ref><ref>Nietzsche, F. (1885) \u2013 p. 4, Original publication \u2013 \"Ich liebe die, welche nicht erst hinter den Sternen einen Grund suchen, unterzugehen und Opfer zu sein: sondern die sich der Erde opfern, dass die Erde einst des \u00dcbermenschen werde.\"</ref>  The turn away from the earth is prompted, he says, by a dissatisfaction with life that causes the sufferer to imagine another world which will fulfill his revenge. The {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} grasps the earthly world with relish and gratitude.\n\nZarathustra declares that the Christian escape from this world also required the invention of an immortal soul separate from the earthly body. This led to the abnegation and mortification of the body, or [[asceticism]]. Zarathustra further links the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to the body and to interpreting the soul as simply an aspect of the body.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|title=Thus Spoke Zarathustra|location=London|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2003|page=61|isbn=978-0-140-44118-5}}</ref>\n\n==Death of God and the creation of new values==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nZarathustra ties the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to the [[God is dead|death of God]]. While the concept of God was the ultimate expression of other-worldly values and their underlying instincts, belief in God nevertheless did give meaning to life for a time. \"God is dead\" means that the idea of God can no longer provide values. With the sole source of values exhausted, the danger of [[nihilism]] looms.\n\nZarathustra presents the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as the creator of new values to banish nihilism. If the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} acts to create new values within the moral vacuum of nihilism, there is nothing that this creative act would not justify. Alternatively, in the absence of this creation, there are no grounds upon which to criticize or justify any action, including the particular values created and the means by which they are promulgated.\n\nIn order to avoid a relapse into [[Platonic idealism]] or asceticism, the creation of these new values cannot be motivated by the same instincts that gave birth to those tables of values. Instead, they must be motivated by a love of this world and of life. Whereas Nietzsche diagnosed the Christian value system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense, the new values which the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative (see [[Nietzschean affirmation]]).\n\n==As a goal==\nZarathustra first announces the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as a goal humanity can set for itself. All human life would be given meaning by how it advanced a new generation of human beings. The aspiration of a woman would be to give birth to an {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}, for example; her relationships with men would be judged by this standard.<ref>''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', I.18; Lampert, ''Nietzsche's; Rosen, ''Mask of Enlightenment'', 118.</ref>\n\nZarathustra contrasts the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} with the degenerate [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity, an alternative goal which humanity might set for itself.  [[Last man|The last man]] appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a smothering of aspiration antithetical to the spirit of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}.\n\nAccording to [[R\u00fcdiger Safranski]], some commentators associate the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} with a program of [[eugenics]].<ref>Safranski, ''Nietzsche'', 262-64, 266\u201368.</ref>  This is most pronounced when considered in the aspect of a goal that humanity sets for itself.  The reduction of all [[psychology]] to [[physiology]] implies, to some, that human beings can be bred for cultural traits. This interpretation of Nietzsche's doctrine focuses more on the future of humanity than on a single cataclysmic individual.  There is no consensus regarding how this aspect of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} relates to the creation of new values.\n\n==Re-embodiment of amoral aristocratic values==\n\nFor [[R\u00fcdiger Safranski]], the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} represents a higher biological type reached through [[artificial selection]] and at the same time is also an ideal for anyone who is creative and strong enough to master the whole spectrum of human potential, good and \"evil\", to become an \"artist-tyrant\". In ''Ecce Homo'', Nietzsche vehemently denied any [[idealistic]], [[Democracy|democratic]] or [[humanitarian]] interpretation of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}: \"The word {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} [designates] a type of supreme achievement, as opposed to 'modern' men, 'good' men, [[Christians]], and other [[nihilists]] ... When I whispered into the ears of some people that they were better off looking for a [[Cesare Borgia]] than a [[Percival|Parsifal]], they did not believe their ears.\"<ref>Nietzsche, ''Ecce Homo'', Why I Write Such Good Books, \u00a71)</ref> Safranski argues that the combination of ruthless warrior pride and artistic brilliance that defined the [[Italian Renaissance]] embodied the sense of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} for Nietzsche. According to Safranski, Nietzsche intended the ultra-aristocratic figure of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to serve as a Machiavellian bogeyman of the modern Western middle class and its pseudo-Christian egalitarian value system.<ref>Safranski, ''Nietzsche'', 365</ref>\n\n==Relation to the eternal recurrence==\nThe {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} shares a place of prominence in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' with another of Nietzsche's key concepts:  the [[Eternal return#Friedrich Nietzsche|eternal recurrence of the same]]. Several interpretations for this fact have been offered.\n\nLaurence Lampert suggests that the eternal recurrence replaces the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as the object of serious aspiration.<ref>Lampert, ''Nietzsche's Teaching''.</ref>  This is in part due to the fact that even the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} can appear like an other-worldly hope.  The {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} lies in the future \u2014 no historical figures have ever been {{lang|de|\u00dcbermenschen}} \u2014 and so still represents a sort of [[eschatology|eschatological]] redemption in some future time.\n\nStanley Rosen, on the other hand, suggests that the doctrine of eternal return is an [[esotericism|esoteric]] ruse meant to save the concept of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} from the charge of Idealism.<ref>Rosen, ''The Mask of Enlightenment''.</ref>  Rather than positing an as-yet unexperienced perfection, Nietzsche would be the prophet of something that has occurred a countless number of times in the past.\n\nOthers<!---I know people say this; just can't be bothered right now to search files for who.  Please correct my laziness.---> maintain that willing the eternal recurrence of the same is a necessary step if the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism.  Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values.  Therefore, it could seem that the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism.  Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism.\n\nStill others<!---I know people say this; just can't be bothered right now to search files for who.  Please correct my laziness.---> suggest that one must have the strength of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} in order to will the eternal recurrence of the same; that is, only the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.\n\n==Nazism==\nThe term {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} was used frequently by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime to describe their idea of a biologically superior [[Aryan race|Aryan]] or Germanic master race;<ref name=\"Alexander 2011\">{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey|title=A Contemporary Introduction to Sociology |edition=2nd |year=2011|publisher=Paradigm|isbn=978-1-61205-029-4}}</ref> a [[racism|racial]] version of Nietzsche's {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} became a philosophical foundation for National Socialist ideas.<ref>[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/nietzsche_crimes/7.html \"Nietzsche inspired Hitler and other killers \u2013 Page 7\"], Court TV Crime Library</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://econ161.berkeley.edu/tceh/Nietzsche.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313191954/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/tceh/Nietzsche.html |archive-date=2012-03-13 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The Nazi notion of the [[master race]] also spawned the idea of \"inferior humans\" (''[[Untermensch]]en'') who should be dominated and enslaved; this term does not originate with Nietzsche, who was critical of both [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche.27s criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|antisemitism and German nationalism]].

In 1909, [[Thomas Common]] translated it as \"Superman\", following the terminology of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1903 stage play ''[[Man and Superman]]''. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] lambasted this translation in the 1950s for two reasons: first, the failure of the English prefix \"super\" to capture the nuance of the German {{lang|de|[[\u00fcber]]}} (though in Latin, its meaning of \"above\" or \"beyond\" is closer to the German); and second, for promoting misidentification of Nietzsche's concept with the comic-book character [[Superman]]. Kaufmann and others preferred to translate {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as \"overman\". A better translation like \"superior humans\" might better fit the concept of Nietzsche as he unfolds his narrative. Scholars continue to employ both terms, some simply opting to reproduce the German word.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lampert|first=Laurence|title=Nietzsche's Teaching|location=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1986}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stanley|title=The Mask of Enlightenment|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}</ref>\n\nThe German prefix {{lang|de|[[\u00fcber]]}} can have connotations of superiority, transcendence, excessiveness, or intensity, depending on the words to which it is attached.<ref>''Duden Deutsches Universal W\u00f6rterbuch A\u2013Z,'' s.v. \u00fcber-.</ref> ''Mensch'' refers to a human being, rather than a male specifically.

Retrieved from http://en.pons.eu/german-english/%C3%BCbermenschlich.</ref>\n\n==This-worldliness==\nNietzsche introduces the concept of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} in contrast to his understanding of the other-worldliness of [[Christianity]]: Zarathustra proclaims the will of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to give meaning to life on earth, and admonishes his audience to ignore those who promise other-worldly fulfillment to draw them away from the earth.<ref>Hollingdale, R. J. (1961), page 44 \u2013 English translation of Zarathustra's prologue; \"I love those who do not first seek beyond the stars for reasons to go down and to be sacrifices: but who sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth may one day belong to the Superman\"</ref><ref>Nietzsche, F. (1885) \u2013 p. 4, Original publication \u2013 \"Ich liebe die, welche nicht erst hinter den Sternen einen Grund suchen, unterzugehen und Opfer zu sein: sondern die sich der Erde opfern, dass die Erde einst des \u00dcbermenschen werde.\"</ref>  The turn away from the earth is prompted, he says, by a dissatisfaction with life that causes the sufferer to imagine another world which will fulfill his revenge. The {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} grasps the earthly world with relish and gratitude.\n\nZarathustra declares that the Christian escape from this world also required the invention of an immortal soul separate from the earthly body. This led to the abnegation and mortification of the body, or [[asceticism]]. Zarathustra further links the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to the body and to interpreting the soul as simply an aspect of the body.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|title=Thus Spoke Zarathustra|location=London|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2003|page=61|isbn=978-0-140-44118-5}}</ref>\n\n==Death of God and the creation of new values==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nZarathustra ties the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to the [[God is dead|death of God]]. While the concept of God was the ultimate expression of other-worldly values and their underlying instincts, belief in God nevertheless did give meaning to life for a time. \"God is dead\" means that the idea of God can no longer provide values. With the sole source of values exhausted, the danger of [[nihilism]] looms.\n\nZarathustra presents the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as the creator of new values to banish nihilism. If the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} acts to create new values within the moral vacuum of nihilism, there is nothing that this creative act would not justify. Alternatively, in the absence of this creation, there are no grounds upon which to criticize or justify any action, including the particular values created and the means by which they are promulgated.\n\nIn order to avoid a relapse into [[Platonic idealism]] or asceticism, the creation of these new values cannot be motivated by the same instincts that gave birth to those tables of values. Instead, they must be motivated by a love of this world and of life. Whereas Nietzsche diagnosed the Christian value system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense, the new values which the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative (see [[Nietzschean affirmation]]).\n\n==As a goal==\nZarathustra first announces the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as a goal humanity can set for itself. All human life would be given meaning by how it advanced a new generation of human beings. The aspiration of a woman would be to give birth to an {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}, for example; her relationships with men would be judged by this standard.<ref>''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', I.18; Lampert, ''Nietzsche's; Rosen, ''Mask of Enlightenment'', 118.</ref>\n\nZarathustra contrasts the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} with the degenerate [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity, an alternative goal which humanity might set for itself.  [[Last man|The last man]] appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a smothering of aspiration antithetical to the spirit of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}.\n\nAccording to [[R\u00fcdiger Safranski]], some commentators associate the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} with a program of [[eugenics]].<ref>Safranski, ''Nietzsche'', 262-64, 266\u201368.</ref>  This is most pronounced when considered in the aspect of a goal that humanity sets for itself.  The reduction of all [[psychology]] to [[physiology]] implies, to some, that human beings can be bred for cultural traits. This interpretation of Nietzsche's doctrine focuses more on the future of humanity than on a single cataclysmic individual.  There is no consensus regarding how this aspect of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} relates to the creation of new values.\n\n==Re-embodiment of amoral aristocratic values==\n\nFor [[R\u00fcdiger Safranski]], the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} represents a higher biological type reached through [[artificial selection]] and at the same time is also an ideal for anyone who is creative and strong enough to master the whole spectrum of human potential, good and \"evil\", to become an \"artist-tyrant\". In ''Ecce Homo'', Nietzsche vehemently denied any [[idealistic]], [[Democracy|democratic]] or [[humanitarian]] interpretation of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}: \"The word {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} [designates] a type of supreme achievement, as opposed to 'modern' men, 'good' men, [[Christians]], and other [[nihilists]] ... When I whispered into the ears of some people that they were better off looking for a [[Cesare Borgia]] than a [[Percival|Parsifal]], they did not believe their ears.\"<ref>Nietzsche, ''Ecce Homo'', Why I Write Such Good Books, \u00a71)</ref> Safranski argues that the combination of ruthless warrior pride and artistic brilliance that defined the [[Italian Renaissance]] embodied the sense of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} for Nietzsche. According to Safranski, Nietzsche intended the ultra-aristocratic figure of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} to serve as a Machiavellian bogeyman of the modern Western middle class and its pseudo-Christian egalitarian value system.<ref>Safranski, ''Nietzsche'', 365</ref>\n\n==Relation to the eternal recurrence==\nThe {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} shares a place of prominence in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' with another of Nietzsche's key concepts:  the [[Eternal return#Friedrich Nietzsche|eternal recurrence of the same]]. Several interpretations for this fact have been offered.\n\nLaurence Lampert suggests that the eternal recurrence replaces the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} as the object of serious aspiration.<ref>Lampert, ''Nietzsche's Teaching''.</ref>  This is in part due to the fact that even the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} can appear like an other-worldly hope.  The {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} lies in the future \u2014 no historical figures have ever been {{lang|de|\u00dcbermenschen}} \u2014 and so still represents a sort of [[eschatology|eschatological]] redemption in some future time.\n\nStanley Rosen, on the other hand, suggests that the doctrine of eternal return is an [[esotericism|esoteric]] ruse meant to save the concept of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} from the charge of Idealism.<ref>Rosen, ''The Mask of Enlightenment''.</ref>  Rather than positing an as-yet unexperienced perfection, Nietzsche would be the prophet of something that has occurred a countless number of times in the past.\n\nOthers<!---I know people say this; just can't be bothered right now to search files for who.  Please correct my laziness.---> maintain that willing the eternal recurrence of the same is a necessary step if the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism.  Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values.  Therefore, it could seem that the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}}, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism.  Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism.\n\nStill others<!---I know people say this; just can't be bothered right now to search files for who.  Please correct my laziness.---> suggest that one must have the strength of the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} in order to will the eternal recurrence of the same; that is, only the {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.\n\n==Nazism==\nThe term {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} was used frequently by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime to describe their idea of a biologically superior [[Aryan race|Aryan]] or Germanic master race;<ref name=\"Alexander 2011\">{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey|title=A Contemporary Introduction to Sociology |edition=2nd |year=2011|publisher=Paradigm|isbn=978-1-61205-029-4}}</ref> a [[racism|racial]] version of Nietzsche's {{lang|de|\u00dcbermensch}} became a philosophical foundation for National Socialist ideas.<ref>[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/nietzsche_crimes/7.html \"Nietzsche inspired Hitler and other killers \u2013 Page 7\"], Court TV Crime Library</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://econ161.berkeley.edu/tceh/Nietzsche.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313191954/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/tceh/Nietzsche.html |archive-date=2012-03-13 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The Nazi notion of the [[master race]] also spawned the idea of \"inferior humans\" (''[[Untermensch]]en'') who should be dominated and enslaved; this term does not originate with Nietzsche, who was critical of both [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche.27s criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|antisemitism and German nationalism]]. In his final years, Nietzsche began to believe that he was in fact Polish, not German, and was quoted as saying, \"I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood\".<ref>[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], \"Ecce Homo: How One Becomes What One Is\" [https://books.google.com/books/about/Ecce_Homo.html?id=tVL-Dmg6TlUC]</ref> In defiance of nationalist doctrines, he claimed that he and Germany were great only because of \"Polish blood in their veins\",<ref>[[Henry Louis Mencken]], \"The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche\", T.

Bookchin says that \"workers must see themselves as human beings, not as class beings; as creative personalities, not as 'proletarians,' as self-affirming individuals, not as 'masses'. . .(the) economic component must be humanized precisely by bringing an 'affinity of friendship' to the work process, by diminishing the role of onerous work in the lives of producers, indeed by a total 'transvaluation of values' (to use Nietzsche's phrase) as it applies to production and consumption as well as social and personal life.\"<ref name=\"anarchonietzche\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The comic-book hero [[Superman]], when [[Jerry Siegel|Jerome \"Jerry\" Siegel]] first created him, was originally a villain modeled on Nietzsche's idea (see \"[[The Reign of the Superman]]\").{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} He was re-invented as a hero by his eventual designer, [[Joe Shuster|Joseph \"Joe\" Shuster]], after which he bore little resemblance to the previous character.
