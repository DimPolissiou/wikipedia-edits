This condition ensures that collisions are well-defined events in space and time, and holds if the dimensionless parameter <math>\\gamma \\equiv r_c^3 n</math> is small, where <math>r_c</math> is the range of interparticle interactions and <math>n</math> is the number density.<ref name=\"Balescu1975\">{{Citation\n| last1  = Balescu\n| first1 = Radu\n| author-link = Radu B\u0103lescu\n| title     = Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics\n| publisher = John Wiley & Sons\n| year    = 1975\n| isbn    = 978-0-471-04600-4\n}}</ref> In addition to this assumption, Chapman\u2013Enskog theory also requires that <math>\\tau_f</math> is much smaller than any ''extrinsic'' timescales <math>\\{\\tau_{\\text{ext}}\\}</math>. These are the timescales associated with the terms on the left hand side of the Boltzmann equation, which describe variations of the gas state over macroscopic lengths. Typically, their values are determined by initial/boundary conditions and/or external fields.

The primary goal of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is to systematically obtain generalizations of the Euler equations which do incorporate dissipation. This is achieved by expressing deviations from local equilibrium as a perturbative series in [[Knudsen number]] <math>\\text{Kn}</math>, which is small if <math>\\tau_f \\ll \\{\\tau_{\\text{ext}}\\}</math>. Conceptually, the resulting hydrodynamic equations describe the dynamical interplay between free streaming and interparticle collisions. The latter tend to drive the gas ''towards'' local equilibrium, while the former acts across spatial inhomogeneities to drive the gas ''away'' from local equilibrium.<ref>Balescu, p. 451</ref> When the Knudsen number is of the order of 1 or greater, the gas in the system being considered cannot be described as a fluid.\n\nTo first order in <math>\\text{Kn}</math>, one obtains the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. Second and third orders give rise to the [[Burnett equations]] and super-Burnett equations.\n\n==Mathematical formulation==\nSince the Knudsen number does not appear explicitly in the Boltzmann equation, but rather implicitly in terms of the distribution function and boundary conditions, a dummy parameter <math>\\epsilon</math> is introduced to keep track of the appropriate orders in the Chapman\u2013Enskog expansion:\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v\\cdot }\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}+\\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\hat{C} f.\n</math>\n\nIt can be seen that small <math>\\epsilon</math> implies the collisional term <math>\\hat{C} f</math> dominates the streaming term <math>\\mathbf{v\\cdot}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{r}}+\\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}</math>, which is the same as saying the Knudsen number is small. Thus, the appropriate form for the Chapman\u2013Enskog expansion is\n\n:<math>\nf=f^{(0)}+\\epsilon f^{(1)}+\\epsilon ^{2}f^{(2)}+\\ldots \\ .\n</math>\n\nSolutions which can be formally expanded in this way are known as ''normal'' solutions to the Boltzmann equation.<ref name=\"Grad1958\">{{Citation\n| last  = Grad\n| first = Harold\n| author-link  = Harold Grad\n| year=1958\n| title = Principles of the Kinetic Theory of Gases \n| editor-last  = Fl\u00fcgge\n| editor-first = S.\n| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Physics\n| volume = XII\n| pages  = 205\u2013294\n| publisher = Springer-Verlag\n}}</ref> Clearly, this class of solutions excludes non-perturbative contributions (such as <math>e^{-1/\\epsilon}</math>), which appear in boundary layers or near internal [[Shock wave|shock layers]]. Thus, Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is restricted to situations in which such solutions are negligible.\n\nSubstituting this expansion and equating orders of <math>\\epsilon</math> leads to the hierarchy\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nJ(f^{(0)},f^{(0)}) &=0 \\\\\n2J(f^{(0)},f^{(n)}) &=\\left(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v\\cdot }\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}+\\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\mathbf{v}} \\right) f^{(n-1)}\n-\\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}J(f^{(n)},f^{(n-m)}), \\qquad n > 0, \n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>J</math> is an integral operator, linear in both its arguments, which satisfies <math>J(f,g) = J(g,f)</math> and <math>J(f,f) = \\hat{C}f</math>. The solution to the first equation is a Gaussian:\n\n:<math>\nf^{(0)}=n'(\\mathbf{r},t)\\left( \\frac{m}{2\\pi k_{B}T'(\\mathbf{r},t)}\\right)^{3/2}\\exp \\left[ -\\frac{m\\left( \\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{v}'_{0}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\right) ^{2}}{2k_{B}T'(\\mathbf{r},t)}\\right].  \n</math>\n\nfor some functions <math>n'(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>, <math>\\mathbf{v}'_{0}(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>, and <math>T'(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>. It is tempting to equate these functions with the physical hydrodynamic fields defined as moments of <math>f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t)</math>:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nn(\\mathbf{r},t) &= \\int fd\\mathbf{v} \\\\\nn(\\mathbf{r},t)v_{0}(\\mathbf{r},t) &= \\int \\mathbf{v} f d\\mathbf{v} \\\\\nn(\\mathbf{r},t)T(\\mathbf{r},t) &= \\int \\frac{m}{3k_{B}}\\mathbf{v}^{2}f d\\mathbf{v}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nFrom a purely mathematical point of view, however, the two sets of functions are not necessarily the same for <math>\\epsilon > 0</math> (for <math>\\epsilon = 0</math> they are equal by definition). Indeed, proceeding systematically in the hierarchy, one finds that similarly to <math>f^{(0)}</math>, each <math>f^{(n)}</math> also contains arbitrary functions of <math>\\mathbf{r}</math> and <math>t</math> whose relation to the physical hydrodynamic fields is ''a priori'' unknown. One of the key simplifying assumptions of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is to ''assume'' that these otherwise arbitrary functions can be written in terms of the ''exact'' hydrodynamic fields and their spatial gradients. In other words, the space and time dependence of <math>f</math> enters only implicitly through the hydrodynamic fields. This statement is physically plausible, since for small Knudsen numbers, one expects to enter the hydrodynamic regime in which the state of the gas is determined solely by the hydrodynamic fields. In the case of <math>f^{(0)}</math>, the functions <math>n'(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>, <math>\\mathbf{v}'_{0}(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>, and <math>T'(\\mathbf{r},t)</math> are assumed exactly equal to the physical hydrodynamic fields.\n\nWhile these assumptions are physically plausible, there is the question of whether solutions which satisfy these properties actually exist. More precisely, one must show that solutions exist satisfying\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\int \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\epsilon^{n}f^{(n)}d\\mathbf{v}= 0 = \\int \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\epsilon^{n}f^{(n)}\\mathbf{v}^{2}d\\mathbf{v}  \\\\\n\\int \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\epsilon^{n}f^{(n)}v_{i}d\\mathbf{v} = 0, \\qquad i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nMoreover, even if such solutions exist, there remains the additional question of whether they span the complete set of normal solutions to the Boltzmann equation, i.e. do not represent an artificial restriction of the original expansion in <math>\\epsilon</math>. One of the key technical achievements of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is to answer both of these questions in the positive.<ref name=\"Grad1958\"/> Thus, at least at the formal level, there is no loss of generality in the Chapman\u2013Enskog approach. \n\nWith these formal considerations established, one can proceed to calculate <math>f^{(1)}</math>.

This surprising result traces back to [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who inferred it in 1860 on the basis of more elementary kinetic arguments.<ref> {{Citation\n| last       = Maxwell\n| first      = James\n| author-link  = James Clerk Maxwell\n| year       = 1860\n| title      = V.

For rigid elastic spheres, the predicted scaling is <math>\\mu \\propto T^{1/2}</math>, while other models typically show greater variation with temperature. For instance, for molecules repelling each other with force <math>\\propto r^{-\\nu}</math> the predicted scaling is <math>\\mu \\propto T^s</math>, where <math>s = 1/2 + 2/(\\nu - 1)</math>. Taking <math>s = 0.668</math>, corresponding to <math>\\nu \\approx 12.9</math>, shows reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed scaling for helium. For more complex gases the agreement is not as good, most likely due to the neglect of attractive forces.<ref>Chapman & Cowling, pp. 230-232</ref>  Indeed, the [[Lennard-Jones potential|Lennard-Jones model]], which does incorporate attractions, can be brought into closer agreement with experiment (albeit at the cost of a more opaque <math>T</math> dependence; see the Lennard-Jones entry in table 1).<ref>Chapman & Cowling, pp. 235-237</ref> \n\nChapman\u2013Enskog theory also predicts a simple relation between <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\mu</math> in the form <math>\\lambda = f \\mu c_v</math>, where <math>c_v</math> is the [[Heat capacity| specific heat]] at constant volume and <math>f</math> is a purely numerical factor. For spherically symmetric molecules, its value is predicted to be very close to <math>2.5</math> in a slightly model-dependent way. For instance, rigid elastic spheres have <math>f \\approx 2.522</math>, and molecules with repulsive force <math>\\propto r^{-13}</math> have <math>f \\approx 2.511</math> (the latter deviation is ignored in table 1). The special case of [[Maxwell molecule|Maxwell molecules]] (repulsive force <math>\\propto r^{-5}</math>) has <math>f = 2.5</math>  exactly.<ref>Chapman & Cowling, pp. 247</ref> Since <math>\\lambda</math>, <math>\\mu</math>, and <math>c_v</math> can be measured directly in experiments, an easy experimental test of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is to measure <math>f</math> for the spherically symmetric [[noble gas|noble gases]]. Table 2 shows that there is reasonable agreement between theory and experiment.<ref name=\"ChapmanandCowlingpage249\">Chapman & Cowling p. 249</ref>\n\n==Extensions==\n\nThe basic principles of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory can be extended to more diverse physical models, including gas mixtures and molecules with internal degrees of freedom. In the high-density regime, the theory can be adapted to account for collisional transport of momentum and energy, i.e. transport over a molecular diameter ''during'' a collision, rather than over a mean free path (''in between'' collisions). Including this mechanism predicts a density dependence of the viscosity at high enough density, which is also observed experimentally.\n\nOne can also carry out the theory to higher order in the Knudsen number. In particular, the third-order contribution <math>f^{(2)}</math> has been calculated by Burnett.<ref name=\"Burnett\">{{Citation\n| last       = Burnett\n| first      = D.\n| year       = 1936\n| journal    = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society\n| title      = The Distribution of Molecular Velocities and the Mean Motion in a Non-Uniform Gas\n| volume     = 40\n| page       = 382\n| doi      = 10.1112/plms/s2-40.1.382\n}}</ref> In general circumstances, however, these high-order corrections should be approached with caution, given that the Chapman\u2013Enskog expansion may not always converge.<ref name=\"Santos1986\">{{Citation\n| last1       = Santos\n| first1      = Andres\n| last2       = Brey\n| first2      = J.

The most basic of these requires a separation of scale between the collision duration <math>\\tau_c</math> and the mean free time between collisions <math>\\tau_f</math>: <math>\\tau_c \\ll \\tau_f</math>. This condition ensures that collisions are well-defined events in space and time, and holds if the dimensionless parameter <math>\\gamma \\equiv r_c^3 n</math> is small, where <math>r_c</math> is the range of interparticle interactions and <math>n</math> is the number density.<ref name=\"Balescu1975\">{{Citation\n| last1  = Balescu\n| first1 = Radu\n| author-link = Radu B\u0103lescu\n| title     = Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics\n| publisher = John Wiley & Sons\n| year    = 1975\n| isbn    = 978-0-471-04600-4\n}}</ref> In addition to this assumption, Chapman\u2013Enskog theory also requires that <math>\\tau_f</math> is much smaller than any ''extrinsic'' timescales <math>\\{\\tau_{\\text{ext}}\\}</math>. These are the timescales associated with the terms on the left hand side of the Boltzmann equation, which describe variations of the gas state over macroscopic lengths. Typically, their values are determined by initial/boundary conditions and/or external fields. This separation of scales implies that the collisional term on the right hand side of the Boltzmann equation is much larger than the streaming terms on the left hand side. Thus, an approximate solution can be found from\n\n:<math>\n\\hat{C} f = 0.\n</math>\n\nIt can be shown that the solution to this equation is a [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]]:\n\n:<math>\nf=n(\\mathbf{r},t)\\left( \\frac{m}{2\\pi k_{B}T(\\mathbf{r},t)}\\right)\n^{3/2}\\exp \\left[ -\\frac{m\\left( \\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{v}_{0}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\right) ^{2}}{2k_{B}T(\\mathbf{r},t)}\\right], \n</math>\n\nwhere <math>m</math> is the molecule mass and <math>k_B</math> is the [[Boltzmann constant]].<ref name=\"Cercignani1975\">{{Citation\n| last1  = Cercignani\n| first1 = Carlo\n| title     = Theory and Application of the Boltzmann Equation\n| publisher = Elsevier\n| year    = 1975\n| isbn    = 978-0-444-19450-3\n| pages    = 78\u201379\n}}</ref>\nA gas is said to be in ''local equilibrium'' if it satisfies this equation.<ref>Balescu, p. 450</ref> The assumption of local equilibrium leads directly to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]], which describe fluids without dissipation, i.e. with thermal conductivity and viscosity equal to <math>0</math>. The primary goal of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is to systematically obtain generalizations of the Euler equations which do incorporate dissipation. This is achieved by expressing deviations from local equilibrium as a perturbative series in [[Knudsen number]] <math>\\text{Kn}</math>, which is small if <math>\\tau_f \\ll \\{\\tau_{\\text{ext}}\\}</math>. Conceptually, the resulting hydrodynamic equations describe the dynamical interplay between free streaming and interparticle collisions. The latter tend to drive the gas ''towards'' local equilibrium, while the former acts across spatial inhomogeneities to drive the gas ''away'' from local equilibrium.<ref>Balescu, p. 451</ref> When the Knudsen number is of the order of 1 or greater, the gas in the system being considered cannot be described as a fluid.\n\nTo first order in <math>\\text{Kn}</math>, one obtains the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. Second and third orders give rise to the [[Burnett equations]] and super-Burnett equations.\n\n==Mathematical formulation==\nSince the Knudsen number does not appear explicitly in the Boltzmann equation, but rather implicitly in terms of the distribution function and boundary conditions, a dummy parameter <math>\\epsilon</math> is introduced to keep track of the appropriate orders in the Chapman\u2013Enskog expansion:\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v\\cdot }\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}+\\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\hat{C} f.\n</math>\n\nIt can be seen that small <math>\\epsilon</math> implies the collisional term <math>\\hat{C} f</math> dominates the streaming term <math>\\mathbf{v\\cdot}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\mathbf{r}}+\\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}</math>, which is the same as saying the Knudsen number is small. Thus, the appropriate form for the Chapman\u2013Enskog expansion is\n\n:<math>\nf=f^{(0)}+\\epsilon f^{(1)}+\\epsilon ^{2}f^{(2)}+\\ldots \\ .\n</math>\n\nSolutions which can be formally expanded in this way are known as ''normal'' solutions to the Boltzmann equation.<ref name=\"Grad1958\">{{Citation\n| last  = Grad\n| first = Harold\n| author-link  = Harold Grad\n| year=1958\n| title = Principles of the Kinetic Theory of Gases \n| editor-last  = Fl\u00fcgge\n| editor-first = S.\n| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Physics\n| volume = XII\n| pages  = 205\u2013294\n| publisher = Springer-Verlag\n}}</ref> Clearly, this class of solutions excludes non-perturbative contributions (such as <math>e^{-1/\\epsilon}</math>), which appear in boundary layers or near internal [[Shock wave|shock layers]]. Thus, Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is restricted to situations in which such solutions are negligible.\n\nSubstituting this expansion and equating orders of <math>\\epsilon</math> leads to the hierarchy\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nJ(f^{(0)},f^{(0)}) &=0 \\\\\n2J(f^{(0)},f^{(n)}) &=\\left(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{v\\cdot }\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}+\\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\mathbf{v}} \\right) f^{(n-1)}\n-\\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}J(f^{(n)},f^{(n-m)}), \\qquad n > 0, \n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>J</math> is an integral operator, linear in both its arguments, which satisfies <math>J(f,g) = J(g,f)</math> and <math>J(f,f) = \\hat{C}f</math>. The solution to the first equation is a Gaussian:\n\n:<math>\nf^{(0)}=n'(\\mathbf{r},t)\\left( \\frac{m}{2\\pi k_{B}T'(\\mathbf{r},t)}\\right)^{3/2}\\exp \\left[ -\\frac{m\\left( \\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{v}'_{0}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\right) ^{2}}{2k_{B}T'(\\mathbf{r},t)}\\right].  \n</math>\n\nfor some functions <math>n'(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>, <math>\\mathbf{v}'_{0}(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>, and <math>T'(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>. It is tempting to equate these functions with the physical hydrodynamic fields defined as moments of <math>f(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{v},t)</math>:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nn(\\mathbf{r},t) &= \\int fd\\mathbf{v} \\\\\nn(\\mathbf{r},t)v_{0}(\\mathbf{r},t) &= \\int \\mathbf{v} f d\\mathbf{v} \\\\\nn(\\mathbf{r},t)T(\\mathbf{r},t) &= \\int \\frac{m}{3k_{B}}\\mathbf{v}^{2}f d\\mathbf{v}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nFrom a purely mathematical point of view, however, the two sets of functions are not necessarily the same for <math>\\epsilon > 0</math> (for <math>\\epsilon = 0</math> they are equal by definition). Indeed, proceeding systematically in the hierarchy, one finds that similarly to <math>f^{(0)}</math>, each <math>f^{(n)}</math> also contains arbitrary functions of <math>\\mathbf{r}</math> and <math>t</math> whose relation to the physical hydrodynamic fields is ''a priori'' unknown. One of the key simplifying assumptions of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is to ''assume'' that these otherwise arbitrary functions can be written in terms of the ''exact'' hydrodynamic fields and their spatial gradients. In other words, the space and time dependence of <math>f</math> enters only implicitly through the hydrodynamic fields. This statement is physically plausible, since for small Knudsen numbers, one expects to enter the hydrodynamic regime in which the state of the gas is determined solely by the hydrodynamic fields. In the case of <math>f^{(0)}</math>, the functions <math>n'(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>, <math>\\mathbf{v}'_{0}(\\mathbf{r},t)</math>, and <math>T'(\\mathbf{r},t)</math> are assumed exactly equal to the physical hydrodynamic fields.\n\nWhile these assumptions are physically plausible, there is the question of whether solutions which satisfy these properties actually exist. More precisely, one must show that solutions exist satisfying\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\int \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\epsilon^{n}f^{(n)}d\\mathbf{v}= 0 = \\int \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\epsilon^{n}f^{(n)}\\mathbf{v}^{2}d\\mathbf{v}  \\\\\n\\int \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }\\epsilon^{n}f^{(n)}v_{i}d\\mathbf{v} = 0, \\qquad i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nMoreover, even if such solutions exist, there remains the additional question of whether they span the complete set of normal solutions to the Boltzmann equation, i.e. do not represent an artificial restriction of the original expansion in <math>\\epsilon</math>. One of the key technical achievements of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is to answer both of these questions in the positive.<ref name=\"Grad1958\"/> Thus, at least at the formal level, there is no loss of generality in the Chapman\u2013Enskog approach. \n\nWith these formal considerations established, one can proceed to calculate <math>f^{(1)}</math>.

This surprising result traces back to [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who inferred it in 1860 on the basis of more elementary kinetic arguments.<ref> {{Citation\n| last       = Maxwell\n| first      = James\n| author-link  = James Clerk Maxwell\n| year       = 1860\n| title      = V.

For rigid elastic spheres, the predicted scaling is <math>\\mu \\propto T^{1/2}</math>, while other models typically show greater variation with temperature. For instance, for molecules repelling each other with force <math>\\propto r^{-\\nu}</math> the predicted scaling is <math>\\mu \\propto T^s</math>, where <math>s = 1/2 + 2/(\\nu - 1)</math>. Taking <math>s = 0.668</math>, corresponding to <math>\\nu \\approx 12.9</math>, shows reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed scaling for helium. For more complex gases the agreement is not as good, most likely due to the neglect of attractive forces.<ref>Chapman & Cowling, pp. 230-232</ref>  Indeed, the [[Lennard-Jones potential|Lennard-Jones model]], which does incorporate attractions, can be brought into closer agreement with experiment (albeit at the cost of a more opaque <math>T</math> dependence; see the Lennard-Jones entry in table 1).<ref>Chapman & Cowling, pp. 235-237</ref> \n\nChapman\u2013Enskog theory also predicts a simple relation between <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\mu</math> in the form <math>\\lambda = f \\mu c_v</math>, where <math>c_v</math> is the [[Heat capacity| specific heat]] at constant volume and <math>f</math> is a purely numerical factor. For spherically symmetric molecules, its value is predicted to be very close to <math>2.5</math> in a slightly model-dependent way. For instance, rigid elastic spheres have <math>f \\approx 2.522</math>, and molecules with repulsive force <math>\\propto r^{-13}</math> have <math>f \\approx 2.511</math> (the latter deviation is ignored in table 1). The special case of [[Maxwell molecule|Maxwell molecules]] (repulsive force <math>\\propto r^{-5}</math>) has <math>f = 2.5</math>  exactly.<ref>Chapman & Cowling, pp. 247</ref> Since <math>\\lambda</math>, <math>\\mu</math>, and <math>c_v</math> can be measured directly in experiments, an easy experimental test of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory is to measure <math>f</math> for the spherically symmetric [[noble gas|noble gases]]. Table 2 shows that there is reasonable agreement between theory and experiment.<ref name=\"ChapmanandCowlingpage249\">Chapman & Cowling p. 249</ref>\n\n==Extensions==\n\nThe basic principles of Chapman\u2013Enskog theory can be extended to more diverse physical models, including gas mixtures and molecules with internal degrees of freedom. In the high-density regime, the theory can be adapted to account for collisional transport of momentum and energy, i.e. transport over a molecular diameter ''during'' a collision, rather than over a mean free path (''in between'' collisions). Including this mechanism predicts a density dependence of the viscosity at high enough density, which is also observed experimentally.\n\nOne can also carry out the theory to higher order in the Knudsen number. In particular, the third-order contribution <math>f^{(2)}</math> has been calculated by Burnett.<ref name=\"Burnett\">{{Citation\n| last       = Burnett\n| first      = D.\n| year       = 1936\n| journal    = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society\n| title      = The Distribution of Molecular Velocities and the Mean Motion in a Non-Uniform Gas\n| volume     = 40\n| page       = 382\n| doi      = 10.1112/plms/s2-40.1.382\n}}</ref> In general circumstances, however, these high-order corrections should be approached with caution, given that the Chapman\u2013Enskog expansion may not always converge.<ref name=\"Santos1986\">{{Citation\n| last1       = Santos\n| first1      = Andres\n| last2       = Brey\n| first2      = J.
