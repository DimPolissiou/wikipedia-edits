All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs. Though Ed occasionally capitulates to his wife's browbeating and mother-in-law's carping, he has no qualms with exploding at and bickering with them, although it only gets him into shouting matches and heated altercations with Mama and Eunice, who will quickly move to bickering with each other in the process. Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip. He spends the vast majority of his time nested on the [[toilet]] in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, he died on the toilet. In flashbacks, Carl's portrayed as a grouch who doesn't want to be interrupted during his long hours on the toilet, even for emergencies.\n\n==Sketches==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | N\u00ba\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest Stars\n|-\n| 1\n| Season 7 (1973\u201374)\n| Ep 23\n| March 16, 1974\n| ''The Reunion'' \u2013 Phillip comes home for a visit.\n| [[Roddy McDowall]] as Phillip\n|-\n| 2\n| rowspan=8 | Season 8 (1974\u201375)\n| Ep 1\n| September 14, 1974\n| ''Brotherly Love'' \u2013 Mama, Eunice and Ed come back home from church.\n|  \n|-\n| 3\n| Ep 5\n| October 12, 1974\n| ''Hospital Visit'' \u2013 The family visits Jack in the hospital.\n| [[Tom Smothers]] as Jack\n|-\n| 4\n| Ep 9\n| November 16, 1974\n| ''Sorry!'' \u2013 The family plays ''[[Sorry!

''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378.

Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters.

He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip. He spends the vast majority of his time nested on the [[toilet]] in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, he died on the toilet. In flashbacks, Carl's portrayed as a grouch who doesn't want to be interrupted during his long hours on the toilet, even for emergencies.\n\n==Sketches==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | N\u00ba\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest Stars\n|-\n| 1\n| Season 7 (1973\u201374)\n| Ep 23\n| March 16, 1974\n| ''The Reunion'' \u2013 Phillip comes home for a visit.\n| [[Roddy McDowall]] as Phillip\n|-\n| 2\n| rowspan=8 | Season 8 (1974\u201375)\n| Ep 1\n| September 14, 1974\n| ''Brotherly Love'' \u2013 Mama, Eunice and Ed come back home from church.\n|  \n|-\n| 3\n| Ep 5\n| October 12, 1974\n| ''Hospital Visit'' \u2013 The family visits Jack in the hospital.\n| [[Tom Smothers]] as Jack\n|-\n| 4\n| Ep 9\n| November 16, 1974\n| ''Sorry!'' \u2013 The family plays ''[[Sorry!

{"title_page": "DNA virus", "text_new": "{{short description|Virus that has DNA as its genetic material}}\nA '''DNA virus''' is a [[virus]] that has [[DNA]] as its [[genetic material]] and replicates using a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]. The [[nucleic acid]] is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA viruses belong to either ''Group I'' or ''Group II'' of the [[Baltimore classification]] system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although ''Group VII'' viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] contain a DNA [[genome]], they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather [[reverse transcribing viruses]] because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. Notable diseases like [[smallpox]], [[herpes]], and the [[chickenpox]] are caused by such DNA viruses.\n\n==Group I: dsDNA viruses==\n[[File:Hhv6 genome2.png|thumb|450px|alt=HHV-6 genome|Genome of ''[[human herpesvirus-6]]'', a member of the family [[Herpesviridae]]]]\n[[Genome]] organization within this group varies considerably. Some have circular genomes (''Baculoviridae'', ''Papovaviridae'' and ''Polydnaviridae'') while others have linear genomes (''Adenoviridae'', ''Herpesviridae'' and some phages). Some families have circularly permuted linear genomes ([[phage T4]] and some ''Iridoviridae''). Others have linear genomes with covalently closed ends (''Poxviridae'' and ''Phycodnaviridae'').\n\nA virus infecting [[archaea]] was first described in 1974. Several others have been described since: most have head-tail morphologies and linear double-stranded DNA genomes. Other morphologies have also been described: spindle shaped, rod shaped, filamentous, icosahedral and spherical. Additional morphological types may exist.\n\n[[Order (biology)|Order]]s within this group are defined on the basis of morphology rather than DNA sequence similarity. It is thought that morphology is more conserved in this group than sequence similarity or gene order which is extremely variable. Three orders and 31 [[family (biology)|families]] are currently recognised. A fourth order\u2014[[Megavirales]]\u2014for the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses has been proposed.<ref name=Colson2012 /><ref name=\"Colson2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Colson P, De Lamballerie X, Yutin N, Asgari S, Bigot Y, Bideshi DK, Cheng XW, Federici BA, Van Etten JL, Koonin EV, La Scola B, Raoult D | title = \"Megavirales\", a proposed new order for eukaryotic nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 158 | issue = 12 | pages = 2517\u20132521 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23812617 | pmc = 4066373 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-013-1768-6 }}</ref> This proposal has yet to be ratified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]].

These two viruses have been placed in the families ''[[Pleolipoviridae]]'' and ''[[Spiraviridae]]''\n\n===Taxonomy===\n\nFamilies in this group have been assigned on the basis of the nature of the genome (circular or linear) and the host range. Twelve families are currently recognised.\n\n* Family ''[[Anelloviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Bacilladnavirus|Bacilladnaviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Bidnaviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Circoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Geminiviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Genomoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Inoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Microviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Nanoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Parvoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Smacoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Spiraviridae]]''\n\n===Classification===\nA division of the circular single stranded viruses into four types has been proposed.<ref name=Rosario2009/> This division seems likely to reflect their phylogenetic relationships.\n\nType I genomes are characterized by a small circular DNA genome (approximately 2-kb), with the Rep protein and the major open reading frame (ORF) in opposite orientations. This type is characteristic of the circoviruses, geminiviruses and nanoviruses.\n\nType II genomes have the unique feature of two separate Rep ORFs.\n\nType III genomes contain two major ORFs in the same orientation. This arrangement is typical of the anelloviruses.\n\nType IV genomes have the largest genomes of nearly 4-kb, with up to eight ORFs. This type of genome is found in the Inoviridae and the Microviridae.\n\nGiven the variety of single stranded viruses that have been described this scheme\u2014if it is accepted by the ICTV\u2014will need to be extended.\n\n====CRESS DNA viruses====\n\nAll known eukaryotic ssDNA viruses have icosahedral capsids.

There are two types of DNA satellite viruses\u2014the [[alphasatellite]]s and the [[betasatellite]]s\u2014both of which are dependent on [[begomovirus]]es. At present satellite viruses are not classified into genera or higher taxa.\n\nAlphasatellites are small circular single strand DNA viruses that require a begomovirus for transmission. Betasatellites are small linear single stranded DNA viruses that require a begomovirus to replicate.\n\n==Phylogenetic relationships==\n===Introduction===\n\nPhylogenetic relationships between these families are difficult to determine. The genomes differ significantly in size and organisation. Most studies that have attempted to determine these relationships are based either on some of the more conserved proteins\u2014DNA polymerase and others\u2014or on common structural features. In general most of the proposed relationships are tentative and have not yet been used by the ICTV in their classification.\n\n===ds DNA viruses===\n====Herpesviruses and caudoviruses====\nWhile determining the phylogenetic relations between the various known clades of viruses is difficult, on a number of grounds the herpesviruses and caudoviruses appear to be related.\n\nWhile the three families in the order Herpesvirales are clearly related on morphological grounds, it has proven difficult to determine the dates of divergence between them because of the lack of gene conservation.<ref name=McGeoch2006/> On morphological grounds they appear to be related to the bacteriophages\u2014specifically the Caudoviruses.\n\nThe branching order among the herpesviruses suggests that ''Alloherpesviridae'' is the basal clade and that ''Herpesviridae'' and ''Malacoherpesviridae'' are sister clades.<ref name=\"Davison2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison AJ | title = Herpesvirus systematics | journal = Veterinary Microbiology | volume = 143 | issue = 1 | pages = 52\u201369 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20346601 | pmc = 2995426 | doi = 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.014 }}</ref> Given the phylogenetic distances between vertebrates and molluscs this suggests that herpesviruses were initially fish viruses and that they have evolved with their hosts to infect other vertebrates.\n\nThe vertebrate herpesviruses initially evolved ~{{Ma|400}} and underwent subsequent evolution on the supercontinent [[Pangaea]].<ref name=Grose2012/> The alphaherpesvirinae separated from the branch leading to the betaherpesvirinae and gammaherpesvirinae about {{Ma|180}} to {{Ma|220}}.<ref name=McGeoch1995/> The avian herpes viruses diverged from the branch leading to the mammalian species.<ref name=McGeoch1994/> The mammalian species divided into two branches\u2014the Simplexvirus and Varicellovirus genera. This latter divergence appears to have occurred around the time of the mammalian radiation.\n\nSeveral dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a powerful ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical components of the packaging machine are the packaging enzyme (terminase) which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The terminase complex consists of a recognition subunit (small terminase) and an endonuclease/translocase subunit (large terminase) and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large terminase subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome. The motor cuts the DNA again and dissociates from the full head, allowing head-finishing proteins to assemble on the portal, sealing the portal, and constructing a platform for tail attachment. Only a single gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of the [[terminase]] (''UL15'') is conserved among all herpesviruses. To a lesser extent this gene is also found in [[T4-like]] [[bacteriophages]] suggesting a common ancestor for these two groups of viruses.<ref name=Davison2002/> Another paper has also suggested that herpesviruses originated among the bacteriophages.<ref name=\"Koonin2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Krupovic M, Yutin N | title = Evolution of double-stranded DNA viruses of eukaryotes: from bacteriophages to transposons to giant viruses | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1341 | issue = 1 | pages = 10\u201324 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25727355 | pmc = 4405056 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12728 | bibcode = 2015NYASA1341...10K }}</ref>\n\nA common origin for the herpesviruses and the caudoviruses has been suggested on the basis of parallels in their capsid assembly pathways and similarities between their portal complexes, through which DNA enters the capsid.<ref name=Baker2005/> These two groups of viruses share a distinctive 12-fold arrangement of subunits in the portal complex.

These are nearly exclusively hyperthermophiles or extreme halophiles. Tailed archaeal viruses are found only in the [[Euryarchaeota]], whereas most filamentous and pleomorphic archaeal viruses occur in the [[Crenarchaeota]]. Bacterial viruses belong to 10 families and infect members of 179 bacterial genera: most of these are members of the [[Firmicutes]] and \u03b3-[[proteobacteria]].\n\nThe vast majority (96.3%) are tailed with and only 230 (3.7%) are polyhedral, filamentous or pleomorphic. The family [[Siphoviridae]] is the largest family (>3600 descriptions: 57.3%). The tailed phages appear to be monophyletic and are the oldest known virus group.<ref name=Ackermann2003/> They arose repeatedly in different hosts and there are at least 11 separate lines of descent.\n\nAll of the known temperate phages employ one of only three different systems for their lysogenic cycle: lambda-like integration/excision, Mu-like transposition or the plasmid-like partitioning of phage N15.\n\nA putative course of evolution of these phages has been proposed by Ackermann.<ref name=Ackermann1998/>\n\nTailed phages originated in the early [[Precambrian]], long before [[eukaryote]]s and their viruses. The ancestral tailed phage had an icosahedral head of about 60 [[nanometer]]s in diameter and a long non contractile tail with sixfold symmetry. The [[capsid]] contained a single molecule of double stranded DNA of about 50 kilobases. The tail was probably provided with a fixation apparatus. The head and tail were held together by a connector. The viral particle contained no [[lipid]]s, was heavier than its descendant viruses and had a high DNA content proportional to its capsid size (~50%). Most of the genome coded for structural proteins. Morphopoietic genes clustered at one end of the genome, with head genes preceding tail genes. Lytic enzymes were probably coded for. Part of the phage genome was nonessential and possibly bacterial.\n\nThe virus infected its host from the outside and injected its DNA. Replication involved transcription in several waves and formation of DNA [[concatemer]]s.\n\nNew phages were released by burst of the infected cell after lysis of host membranes by a [[peptidoglycan hydrolase]]. Capsids were assembled from a starting point, the connector and around a scaffold. They underwent an elaborate maturation process involving protein cleavage and capsid expansion. Heads and tails were assembled separately and joined later. The DNA was cut to size and entered preformed capsids by a headful mechanism.\n\nSubsequently, the phages evolved contractile or short tails and elongated heads. Some viruses become temperate by acquiring an [[integrase]]\u2013[[excisionase]] complex, [[plasmid]] parts or [[transposon]]s.\n\nA possible evolutionary pathway using vesicles rather than a protein coat has been described in the archaeal plasmid pR1SE.<ref name=Erdmann2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Erdmann S, Tschitschko B, Zhong L, Raftery MJ, Cavicchioli R | title = A plasmid from an

material}}\nA '''DNA virus''' is a [[virus]] that has [[DNA]] as its [[genetic material]] and replicates using a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]. The [[nucleic acid]] is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA viruses belong to either ''Group I'' or ''Group II'' of the [[Baltimore classification]] system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although ''Group VII'' viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] contain a DNA [[genome]], they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather [[reverse transcribing viruses]] because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. Notable diseases like [[smallpox]], [[herpes]], and the [[chickenpox]] are caused by such DNA viruses.\n\n==Group I: dsDNA viruses==\n[[File:Hhv6 genome2.png|thumb|450px|alt=HHV-6 genome|Genome of ''[[human herpesvirus-6]]'', a member of the family [[Herpesviridae]]]]\n[[Genome]] organization within this group varies considerably. Some have circular genomes (''Baculoviridae'', ''Papovaviridae'' and ''Polydnaviridae'') while others have linear genomes (''Adenoviridae'', ''Herpesviridae'' and some phages). Some families have circularly permuted linear genomes ([[phage T4]] and some ''Iridoviridae''). Others have linear genomes with covalently closed ends (''Poxviridae'' and ''Phycodnaviridae'').\n\nA virus infecting [[archaea]] was first described in 1974. Several others have been described since: most have head-tail morphologies and linear double-stranded DNA genomes. Other morphologies have also been described: spindle shaped, rod shaped, filamentous, icosahedral and spherical. Additional morphological types may exist.\n\n[[Order (biology)|Order]]s within this group are defined on the basis of morphology rather than DNA sequence similarity. It is thought that morphology is more conserved in this group than sequence similarity or gene order which is extremely variable. Three orders and 31 [[family (biology)|families]] are currently recognised. A fourth order\u2014[[Megavirales]]\u2014for the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses has been proposed.<ref name=Colson2012 /><ref name=\"Colson2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Colson P, De Lamballerie X, Yutin N, Asgari S, Bigot Y, Bideshi DK, Cheng XW, Federici BA, Van Etten JL, Koonin EV, La Scola B, Raoult D | title = \"Megavirales\", a proposed new order for eukaryotic nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 158 | issue = 12 | pages = 2517\u20132521 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23812617 | pmc = 4066373 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-013-1768-6 }}</ref> This proposal has yet to be ratified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]].

These two viruses have been placed in the families ''[[Pleolipoviridae]]'' and ''[[Spiraviridae]]''\n\n===Taxonomy===\n\nFamilies in this group have been assigned on the basis of the nature of the genome (circular or linear) and the host range. Twelve families are currently recognised.\n\n* Family ''[[Anelloviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Bacilladnavirus|Bacilladnaviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Bidnaviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Circoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Geminiviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Genomoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Inoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Microviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Nanoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Parvoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Smacoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Spiraviridae]]''\n\n===Classification===\nA division of the circular single stranded viruses into four types has been proposed.<ref name=Rosario2009/> This division seems likely to reflect their phylogenetic relationships.\n\nType I genomes are characterized by a small circular DNA genome (approximately 2-kb), with the Rep protein and the major open reading frame (ORF) in opposite orientations. This type is characteristic of the circoviruses, geminiviruses and nanoviruses.\n\nType II genomes have the unique feature of two separate Rep ORFs.\n\nType III genomes contain two major ORFs in the same orientation. This arrangement is typical of the anelloviruses.\n\nType IV genomes have the largest genomes of nearly 4-kb, with up to eight ORFs. This type of genome is found in the Inoviridae and the Microviridae.\n\nGiven the variety of single stranded viruses that have been described this scheme\u2014if it is accepted by the ICTV\u2014will need to be extended.\n\n====CRESS DNA viruses====\n\nAll known eukaryotic ssDNA viruses have icosahedral capsids. With the exception of the family ''Bidnaviridae'' and ''Anelloviridae'', all eukaryotic ssDNA viruses encode homologous rolling-circle replication initiation proteins with characteristic N-terminal endonuclease domains and C-terminal superfamily three helicase domains.<ref name=Krupovic2013>Krupovic M (2013) \"Networks of evolutionary interactions underlying the polyphyletic origin of ssDNA viruses\".

In both the ''Geminiviridae'' and ''Nanoviridae'' the genome is composed of more than a single chromosome. The ''Bacillariodnaviridae'' infect [[diatom]]s and have a unique genome: the major chromosome is circular (~6 kilobases in length): the minor chromosome is linear (~1 kilobase in length) and complementary to part of the major chromosome. Members of the ''Spiraviridae'' infect archaea. Members of the ''Genomoviridae'' infect fungi.\n\n===Molecular biology===\nAll viruses in this group require formation of a replicative form\u2014a double stranded DNA intermediate\u2014for genome replication.

Betasatellites are small linear single stranded DNA viruses that require a begomovirus to replicate.\n\n==Phylogenetic relationships==\n===Introduction===\n\nPhylogenetic relationships between these families are difficult to determine. The genomes differ significantly in size and organisation. Most studies that have attempted to determine these relationships are based either on some of the more conserved proteins\u2014DNA polymerase and others\u2014or on common structural features. In general most of the proposed relationships are tentative and have not yet been used by the ICTV in their classification.\n\n===ds DNA viruses===\n====Herpesviruses and caudoviruses====\nWhile determining the phylogenetic relations between the various known clades of viruses is difficult, on a number of grounds the herpesviruses and caudoviruses appear to be related.\n\nWhile the three families in the order Herpesvirales are clearly related on morphological grounds, it has proven difficult to determine the dates of divergence between them because of the lack of gene conservation.<ref name=McGeoch2006/> On morphological grounds they appear to be related to the bacteriophages\u2014specifically the Caudoviruses.\n\nThe branching order among the herpesviruses suggests that ''Alloherpesviridae'' is the basal clade and that ''Herpesviridae'' and ''Malacoherpesviridae'' are sister clades.<ref name=\"Davison2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison AJ | title = Herpesvirus systematics | journal = Veterinary Microbiology | volume = 143 | issue = 1 | pages = 52\u201369 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20346601 | pmc = 2995426 | doi = 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.014 }}</ref> Given the phylogenetic distances between vertebrates and molluscs this suggests that herpesviruses were initially fish viruses and that they have evolved with their hosts to infect other vertebrates.\n\nThe vertebrate herpesviruses initially evolved ~{{Ma|400}} and underwent subsequent evolution on the supercontinent [[Pangaea]].<ref name=Grose2012/> The alphaherpesvirinae separated from the branch leading to the betaherpesvirinae and gammaherpesvirinae about {{Ma|180}} to {{Ma|220}}.<ref name=McGeoch1995/> The avian herpes viruses diverged from the branch leading to the mammalian species.<ref name=McGeoch1994/> The mammalian species divided into two branches\u2014the Simplexvirus and Varicellovirus genera. This latter divergence appears to have occurred around the time of the mammalian radiation.\n\nSeveral dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a powerful ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical components of the packaging machine are the packaging enzyme (terminase) which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The terminase complex consists of a recognition subunit (small terminase) and an endonuclease/translocase subunit (large terminase) and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large terminase subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome. The motor cuts the DNA again and dissociates from the full head, allowing head-finishing proteins to assemble on the portal, sealing the portal, and constructing a platform for tail attachment. Only a single gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of the [[terminase]] (''UL15'') is conserved among all herpesviruses. To a lesser extent this gene is also found in [[T4-like]] [[bacteriophages]] suggesting a common ancestor for these two groups of viruses.<ref name=Davison2002/> Another paper has also suggested that herpesviruses originated among the bacteriophages.<ref name=\"Koonin2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Krupovic M, Yutin N | title = Evolution of double-stranded DNA viruses of eukaryotes: from bacteriophages to transposons to giant viruses | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1341 | issue = 1 | pages = 10\u201324 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25727355 | pmc = 4405056 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12728 | bibcode = 2015NYASA1341...10K }}</ref>\n\nA common origin for the herpesviruses and the caudoviruses has been suggested on the basis of parallels in their capsid assembly pathways and similarities between their portal complexes, through which DNA enters the capsid.<ref name=Baker2005/> These two groups of viruses share a distinctive 12-fold arrangement of subunits in the portal complex.

These are nearly exclusively hyperthermophiles or extreme halophiles. Tailed archaeal viruses are found only in the [[Euryarchaeota]], whereas most filamentous and pleomorphic archaeal viruses occur in the [[Crenarchaeota]]. Bacterial viruses belong to 10 families and infect members of 179 bacterial genera: most of these are members of the [[Firmicutes]] and \u03b3-[[proteobacteria]].\n\nThe vast majority (96.3%) are tailed with and only 230 (3.7%) are polyhedral, filamentous or pleomorphic. The family [[Siphoviridae]] is the largest family (>3600 descriptions: 57.3%). The tailed phages appear to be monophyletic and are the oldest known virus group.<ref name=Ackermann2003/> They arose repeatedly in different hosts and there are at least 11 separate lines of descent.\n\nAll of the known temperate phages employ one of only three different systems for their lysogenic cycle: lambda-like integration/excision, Mu-like transposition or the plasmid-like partitioning of phage N15.\n\nA putative course of evolution of these phages has been proposed by Ackermann.<ref name=Ackermann1998/>\n\nTailed phages originated in the early [[Precambrian]], long before [[eukaryote]]s and their viruses. The ancestral tailed phage had an icosahedral head of about 60 [[nanometer]]s in diameter and a long non contractile tail with sixfold symmetry. The [[capsid]] contained a single molecule of double stranded DNA of about 50 kilobases. The tail was probably provided with a fixation apparatus. The head and tail were held together by a connector. The viral particle contained no [[lipid]]s, was heavier than its descendant viruses and had a high DNA content proportional to its capsid size (~50%). Most of the genome coded for structural proteins. Morphopoietic genes clustered at one end of the genome, with head genes preceding tail genes. Lytic enzymes were probably coded for. Part of the phage genome was nonessential and possibly bacterial.\n\nThe virus infected its host from the outside and injected its DNA. Replication involved transcription in several waves and formation of DNA [[concatemer]]s.\n\nNew phages were released by burst of the infected cell after lysis of host membranes by a [[peptidoglycan hydrolase]]. Capsids were assembled from a starting point, the connector and around a scaffold. They underwent an elaborate maturation process involving protein cleavage and capsid expansion. Heads and tails were assembled separately and joined later. The DNA was cut to size and entered preformed capsids by a headful mechanism.\n\nSubsequently, the phages evolved contractile or short tails and elongated heads. Some viruses become temperate by acquiring an [[integrase]]\u2013[[excisionase]] complex, [[plasmid]] parts or [[transposon]]s.\n\nA possible evolutionary pathway using vesicles rather than a protein coat has been described in the archaeal plasmid pR1SE.<ref name=Erdmann2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Erdmann S, Tschitschko B, Zhong L, Raftery MJ, Cavicchioli R | title = A plasmid from an

Esmonde earned this award while in command of a British [[Fleet Air Arm]] torpedo bomber squadron in the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Early life==\nEsmonde was born on 1 March 1909 in [[Thurgoland]], [[Yorkshire]], near [[Barnsley]], where his Irish Catholic father, Dr [[John Joseph Esmonde]] (1862\u20131915), was in temporary general practice. Esmonde had three elder half-brothers and three half-sisters from his father's first marriage to Rose McGuinness. His brothers were: [[Sir John Esmonde, 14th Baronet]], who served in the [[First World War]]; Second Lieutenant Geoffrey Esmonde (1897\u20131916), who was killed in action in the First World War serving with the 26th [[Tyneside Irish]] Battalion of the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]];<ref>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/276200 Casualty details\u2014Esmonde, Geoffery], [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]. Retrieved 2008-07-16.</ref> and [[Sir Anthony Esmonde, 15th Baronet]]. After the death of his first wife John Esmonde elder married Eily O'Sullivan, who bore him five sons and one daughter: Owen, Donal, John Witham, Eugene and his twin James, Carmel and Patrick. [[Thomas Esmonde (VC)|Thomas Esmonde]], who was awarded the Victoria Cross in the [[Crimean War]], was a great-uncle.\n\nThough the country of his birth was England, Esmonde's parents were from Ireland and he returned to his family's ancestral home of the [[Esmonde baronets]] in [[Drominagh]], [[County Tipperary]] as a boy. He was educated by the [[Jesuits]], first at [[Wimbledon College]] in London and then at [[Clongowes Wood College]] in [[County Kildare]], Ireland.\n\nEsmonde was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) as a [[pilot officer]] on probation on 28 December 1928.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=33453|supp=y|page=72|date=1 January 1929}}</ref> During the early 1930s, Esmonde served first in the RAF, and then transferred to the [[Fleet Air Arm]] where he served in the [[Mediterranean]] when responsibility for naval aviation was returned to the [[Royal Navy]]. Upon leaving the navy in 1934, he flew for [[Imperial Airways]].<ref>[http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_eugene_esmonde.htm Royal Naval Museum biography]</ref> and amongst other feats he flew flying boats and the first sur-charged airmail to Australia.\n\n==Second World War==\n===Early wartime career===\nAt the start of the Second World War, he returned to the Fleet Air Arm with the rank of [[lieutenant commander]]. His first sea posting was to {{HMS|Courageous|50|6}}, which was sunk in September 1939. He returned to sea duty on board {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}} after a series of postings to shore-based stations.\n\nOn the night of 24 May 1941, Esmonde led No. [[825 Naval Air Squadron]]'s nine [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s in an attack against the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck}}.  This attack took place after the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], in which {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} was sunk by the ''Bismarck''. The biplanes flying from ''Victorious'' made a 120-mile flight in foul [[North Atlantic]] weather and one torpedo hit the ''Bismarck'' amidships, leading either directly or indirectly through hard manoeuvring to earlier damage opening up, causing further flooding and a boiler room rendered unusable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3259.html|title=HMS Victorious (38) of the Royal Navy - British Aircraft Carrier of the Illustrious class - Allied Warships of WWII - uboat.net|website=uboat.net|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> The Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet wrote 'This attack, by a squadron so lately embarked in a new carrier, in unfavourable weather conditions, was magnificently carried out and reflects the greatest credit on all concerned.'<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Ben|title=The Fleet Air Arm In The Second World War: Vol 1 1939-1941|publisher=Navy Records Society|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4094-5257-7|location=|pages=490}}</ref> Esmonde was decorated with the [[Distinguished Service Order]] on 11 February 1942 for his leadership and actions (the award was announced on 16 September 1941).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35275|supp=y|page=5357|date=12 September 1941}}</ref>\n\nHis squadron was serving on {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} when she was torpedoed in November 1941. Attempts to tow her to [[Gibraltar]] were abandoned, and on 14 November 1941 she sank. The Swordfish of the squadron ferried some of the crew off the ship before she sank; Esmonde was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] for his actions on this occasion.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35424|supp=y|page=341|date=16 January 1942}}</ref>\n\n===Channel Dash===\nEsmonde earned his Victoria Cross when he led his squadron against elements of the German fleet which were making the \"Channel Dash\" ([[Operation Cerberus|Operation ''Cerberus'']]) from [[Brest, France|Brest]] in an attempt to return to their home bases at [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Kiel]] through the [[English Channel]].  On 12 February 1942 off the coast of [[England]], 32-year-old [[Lieutenant Commander]] Esmonde led a detachment of six Fairey Swordfish in an attack on the German battlecruisers {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}. All three had left Brest unopposed, and, with a strong escort of smaller craft, were entering the [[Straits of Dover]] when Esmonde received his orders. He waited as long as he felt he could for confirmation of his fighter escort, but eventually took off without it. One of the fighter squadrons (10 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s of [[No. 72 Squadron RAF]]) did rendezvous with Esmonde's squadron; the two squadrons were later attacked by enemy fighters of [[JG 2]] and [[JG 26]] as part of [[Operation Donnerkeil|Operation ''Donnerkeil'']], the German [[air superiority]] plan for the mission. The subsequent fighting left all of the planes in Esmonde's squadron damaged, and caused them to become separated from their fighter escort.\n\nThe torpedo bombers continued their attack, in spite of their damage and lack of fighter protection.  There was heavy anti-aircraft fire from the German ships, and Esmonde's aeroplane possibly sustained a direct hit from anti-aircraft fire that destroyed most of one of the port wings of his Swordfish biplane. Esmonde led his flight through a screen of the enemy destroyers and other small vessels protecting the battleships. He was still 2,700 metres from his target when he was hit by a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], resulting in his aircraft bursting into flames and crashing into the sea. The remaining aircraft continued the attack, but all were shot down by enemy fighters; only five of the 18 crew survived the action. The four surviving officers received the [[Distinguished Service Order]], and the enlisted survivor was awarded the [[Conspicuous Gallantry Medal]].<ref name=VCGazette>{{London Gazette|issue=35474|supp=y|pages=1007\u20131008|date=27 February 1942}}</ref>\n\nThe courage of the Swordfish crews was noted by friend and foe alike. Admiral [[Bertram Ramsay]] later wrote, \"In my opinion the gallant sortie of these six Swordfish aircraft constitutes one of the finest exhibitions of self-sacrifice and devotion to duty the war had ever witnessed\", while Admiral [[Otto Ciliax]] in the ''Scharnhorst'' described \"The mothball attack of a handful of ancient planes, piloted by men whose bravery surpasses any other action by either side that day\". As he watched the smoking wrecks of the Swordfish falling into the sea, Captain Hoffmann of the ''Scharnhorst'' exclaimed, \"Poor fellows, they are so very slow, it is nothing but suicide for them to fly against these big ships\". Willhelm Wolf aboard the ''Scharnhorst'' wrote, \"What an heroic stage for them to meet their end! Behind them their homeland, which they had just left with their hearts steeled to their purpose, still in view\".\n\nThe award of the VC was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 3 March 1942, the citation read:\n\n{{quote|''[[ADMIRALTY]]. Whitehall. 3rd&nbsp;March, 1942.''\n\n[[George VI of the United Kingdom|The KING]] has been graciously pleased to approve the grant of the VICTORIA CROSS, for valour and resolution in action against the Enemy, to:\n\nThe late Lieutenant-Commander (A) Eugene Esmonde, D.S.O., Royal Navy.\n\nOn the morning of Thursday, 12th&nbsp;February, 1942, Lieutenant-Commander Esmonde, in command of a Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm, was told that the German Battle-Cruisers SCHARNHORST and GNEISENAU\nand the Cruiser PRINZ EUGEN, strongly escorted by some thirty surface craft, were entering the Straits of Dover, and that his Squadron must attack before they reached the sand-banks North East of Calais.\n\nLieutenant-Commander Esmonde knew well that his enterprise was desperate. Soon after noon he and his squadron of six Swordfish set course for the Enemy, and after ten minutes flight were attacked by a strong force of Enemy fighters. Touch was lost with his fighter escort; and in the action which followed all his aircraft were damaged. He flew on, cool and resolute, serenely challenging hopeless odds, to encounter the deadly fire of the Battle-Cruisers and their Escort, which shattered the port wing of his aircraft. Undismayed, he led his Squadron on, straight through this inferno of fire, in steady flight towards their target. Almost at once he was shot down; but his Squadron went on to launch a gallant attack, in which at least one torpedo is believed to have struck the German Battle-Cruisers, and from which not one of the six aircraft returned.\n\nHis high courage and splendid resolution will live in the traditions of the Royal Navy, and remain for many generations a fine and stirring memory.<ref name=VCGazette />}}\n\nHe was remembered in [[Winston Churchill]]'s famous broadcast speech on 13 May 1945, \"Five years of War\",<ref>[http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/13May45.html Churchill's Speech]</ref>  as having defended Ireland's honour:\n\n{{quote|When I think of these days I think also of other episodes and personalities. I do not forget Lieutenant-Commander Esmonde, V.C., D.S.O., [[John Patrick Kenneally|Lance-Corporal Kenneally]], V.C., [[Edward Stephen Fogarty Fegen|Captain Fegen]], V.C., and other Irish heroes that I could easily recite, and all bitterness by Britain for the Irish race dies in my heart. I can only pray that in years which I shall not see, the shame will be forgotten and the glories will endure, and that the peoples of the British Isles and of the British Commonwealth of Nations will walk together in mutual comprehension and forgiveness.\"}}\n\nSeven weeks later Lieutenant Commander Esmonde's body, still in his lifejacket, was washed ashore in the Thames Estuary near the River Medway.

Esmonde earned this award while in command of a British [[Fleet Air Arm]] torpedo bomber squadron in the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Early life==\nEsmonde was born on 1 March 1909 in [[Thurgoland]], [[Yorkshire]], near [[Barnsley]], where his Irish Catholic father, Dr [[John Joseph Esmonde]] (1862\u20131915), was in temporary general practice. Esmonde had three elder half-brothers and three half-sisters from his father's first marriage to Rose McGuinness. His brothers were: [[Sir John Esmonde, 14th Baronet]], who served in the [[First World War]]; Second Lieutenant Geoffrey Esmonde (1897\u20131916), who was killed in action in the First World War serving with the 26th [[Tyneside Irish]] Battalion of the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]];<ref>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/276200 Casualty details\u2014Esmonde, Geoffery], [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]. Retrieved 2008-07-16.</ref> and [[Sir Anthony Esmonde, 15th Baronet]]. After the death of his first wife John Esmonde elder married Eily O'Sullivan, who bore him five sons and one daughter: Owen, Donal, John Witham, Eugene and his twin James, Carmel and Patrick. [[Thomas Esmonde (VC)|Thomas Esmonde]], who was awarded the Victoria Cross in the [[Crimean War]], was a great-uncle.\n\nThough the country of his birth was England, Esmonde's parents were from Ireland and he returned to his family's ancestral home of the [[Esmonde baronets]] in [[Drominagh]], [[County Tipperary]] as a boy. He was educated by the [[Jesuits]], first at [[Wimbledon College]] in London and then at [[Clongowes Wood College]] in [[County Kildare]], Ireland.\n\nEsmonde was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) as a [[pilot officer]] on probation on 28 December 1928.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=33453|supp=y|page=72|date=1 January 1929}}</ref> During the early 1930s, Esmonde served first in the RAF, and then transferred to the [[Fleet Air Arm]] where he served in the [[Mediterranean]] when responsibility for naval aviation was returned to the [[Royal Navy]]. Upon leaving the navy in 1934, he flew for [[Imperial Airways]].<ref>[http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_eugene_esmonde.htm Royal Naval Museum biography]</ref> and amongst other feats he flew flying boats and the first sur-charged airmail to Australia.\n\n==Second World War==\n===Early wartime career===\nAt the start of the Second World War, he returned to the Fleet Air Arm with the rank of [[lieutenant commander]]. His first sea posting was to {{HMS|Courageous|50|6}}, which was sunk in September 1939. He returned to sea duty on board {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}} after a series of postings to shore-based stations.\n\nOn the night of 24 May 1941, Esmonde led No. [[825 Naval Air Squadron]]'s nine [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s in an attack against the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck}}.  This attack took place after the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], in which {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} was sunk by the ''Bismarck''. The biplanes flying from ''Victorious'' made a 120-mile flight in foul [[North Atlantic]] weather and one torpedo hit the ''Bismarck'' amidships, leading either directly or indirectly through hard manoeuvring to earlier damage opening up, causing further flooding and a boiler room rendered unusable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3259.html|title=HMS Victorious (38) of the Royal Navy - British Aircraft Carrier of the Illustrious class - Allied Warships of WWII - uboat.net|website=uboat.net|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> The Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet wrote 'This attack, by a squadron so lately embarked in a new carrier, in unfavourable weather conditions, was maginficently carried out and reflects the greatest credit on all concerned.'<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Ben|title=The Fleet Air Arm In The Second World War: Vol 1 1939-1941|publisher=Navy Records Society|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4094-5257-7|location=|pages=490}}</ref> Esmonde was decorated with the [[Distinguished Service Order]] on 11 February 1942 for his leadership and actions (the award was announced on 16 September 1941).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35275|supp=y|page=5357|date=12 September 1941}}</ref>\n\nHis squadron was serving on {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} when she was torpedoed in November 1941. Attempts to tow her to [[Gibraltar]] were abandoned, and on 14 November 1941 she sank. The Swordfish of the squadron ferried some of the crew off the ship before she sank; Esmonde was [[Mentioned in Despatches]] for his actions on this occasion.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35424|supp=y|page=341|date=16 January 1942}}</ref>\n\n===Channel Dash===\nEsmonde earned his Victoria Cross when he led his squadron against elements of the German fleet which were making the \"Channel Dash\" ([[Operation Cerberus|Operation ''Cerberus'']]) from [[Brest, France|Brest]] in an attempt to return to their home bases at [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Kiel]] through the [[English Channel]].  On 12 February 1942 off the coast of [[England]], 32-year-old [[Lieutenant Commander]] Esmonde led a detachment of six Fairey Swordfish in an attack on the German battlecruisers {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}. All three had left Brest unopposed, and, with a strong escort of smaller craft, were entering the [[Straits of Dover]] when Esmonde received his orders. He waited as long as he felt he could for confirmation of his fighter escort, but eventually took off without it. One of the fighter squadrons (10 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s of [[No. 72 Squadron RAF]]) did rendezvous with Esmonde's squadron; the two squadrons were later attacked by enemy fighters of [[JG 2]] and [[JG 26]] as part of [[Operation Donnerkeil|Operation ''Donnerkeil'']], the German [[air superiority]] plan for the mission. The subsequent fighting left all of the planes in Esmonde's squadron damaged, and caused them to become separated from their fighter escort.\n\nThe torpedo bombers continued their attack, in spite of their damage and lack of fighter protection.  There was heavy anti-aircraft fire from the German ships, and Esmonde's aeroplane possibly sustained a direct hit from anti-aircraft fire that destroyed most of one of the port wings of his Swordfish biplane. Esmonde led his flight through a screen of the enemy destroyers and other small vessels protecting the battleships. He was still 2,700 metres from his target when he was hit by a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], resulting in his aircraft bursting into flames and crashing into the sea. The remaining aircraft continued the attack, but all were shot down by enemy fighters; only five of the 18 crew survived the action. The four surviving officers received the [[Distinguished Service Order]], and the enlisted survivor was awarded the [[Conspicuous Gallantry Medal]].<ref name=VCGazette>{{London Gazette|issue=35474|supp=y|pages=1007\u20131008|date=27 February 1942}}</ref>\n\nThe courage of the Swordfish crews was noted by friend and foe alike. Admiral [[Bertram Ramsay]] later wrote, \"In my opinion the gallant sortie of these six Swordfish aircraft constitutes one of the finest exhibitions of self-sacrifice and devotion to duty the war had ever witnessed\", while Admiral [[Otto Ciliax]] in the ''Scharnhorst'' described \"The mothball attack of a handful of ancient planes, piloted by men whose bravery surpasses any other action by either side that day\". As he watched the smoking wrecks of the Swordfish falling into the sea, Captain Hoffmann of the ''Scharnhorst'' exclaimed, \"Poor fellows, they are so very slow, it is nothing but suicide for them to fly against these big ships\". Willhelm Wolf aboard the ''Scharnhorst'' wrote, \"What an heroic stage for them to meet their end! Behind them their homeland, which they had just left with their hearts steeled to their purpose, still in view\".\n\nThe award of the VC was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 3 March 1942, the citation read:\n\n{{quote|''[[ADMIRALTY]]. Whitehall. 3rd&nbsp;March, 1942.''\n\n[[George VI of the United Kingdom|The KING]] has been graciously pleased to approve the grant of the VICTORIA CROSS, for valour and resolution in action against the Enemy, to:\n\nThe late Lieutenant-Commander (A) Eugene Esmonde, D.S.O., Royal Navy.\n\nOn the morning of Thursday, 12th&nbsp;February, 1942, Lieutenant-Commander Esmonde, in command of a Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm, was told that the German Battle-Cruisers SCHARNHORST and GNEISENAU\nand the Cruiser PRINZ EUGEN, strongly escorted by some thirty surface craft, were entering the Straits of Dover, and that his Squadron must attack before they reached the sand-banks North East of Calais.\n\nLieutenant-Commander Esmonde knew well that his enterprise was desperate. Soon after noon he and his squadron of six Swordfish set course for the Enemy, and after ten minutes flight were attacked by a strong force of Enemy fighters. Touch was lost with his fighter escort; and in the action which followed all his aircraft were damaged. He flew on, cool and resolute, serenely challenging hopeless odds, to encounter the deadly fire of the Battle-Cruisers and their Escort, which shattered the port wing of his aircraft. Undismayed, he led his Squadron on, straight through this inferno of fire, in steady flight towards their target. Almost at once he was shot down; but his Squadron went on to launch a gallant attack, in which at least one torpedo is believed to have struck the German Battle-Cruisers, and from which not one of the six aircraft returned.\n\nHis high courage and splendid resolution will live in the traditions of the Royal Navy, and remain for many generations a fine and stirring memory.<ref name=VCGazette />}}\n\nHe was remembered in [[Winston Churchill]]'s famous broadcast speech on 13 May 1945, \"Five years of War\",<ref>[http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/13May45.html Churchill's Speech]</ref>  as having defended Ireland's honour:\n\n{{quote|When I think of these days I think also of other episodes and personalities. I do not forget Lieutenant-Commander Esmonde, V.C., D.S.O., [[John Patrick Kenneally|Lance-Corporal Kenneally]], V.C., [[Edward Stephen Fogarty Fegen|Captain Fegen]], V.C., and other Irish heroes that I could easily recite, and all bitterness by Britain for the Irish race dies in my heart. I can only pray that in years which I shall not see, the shame will be forgotten and the glories will endure, and that the peoples of the British Isles and of the British Commonwealth of Nations will walk together in mutual comprehension and forgiveness.\"}}\n\nSeven weeks later Lieutenant Commander Esmonde's body, still in his lifejacket, was washed ashore in the Thames Estuary near the River Medway. Esmonde was buried in the Woodlands Cemetery, [[Gillingham, Kent]] on 30 April 1942.<ref>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2361369 Casualty details\u2014Esmonde, Eugene Kingsmill], [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].

He worked as a taxi driver, film production assistant, messenger, and salesman before making his mark in film as a screenwriter in the late 1970s, in the period between his first two films as a director: horror films ''[[Seizure (film)|Seizure]]'' and ''[[The Hand (1981 film)|The Hand]]''.\n\nIn 1979, Stone was awarded his first Oscar, after adapting true-life prison story ''[[Midnight Express (book)|Midnight Express]]'' into the successful film [[Midnight Express (film)|of the same name]] for British director [[Alan Parker]] (the two men would later collaborate on the 1996 movie of stage musical ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'').

Like his contemporary Michael Mann, Stone is unusual in having written or co-written most of the films he has directed. In 1986, Stone directed two films back to back: the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]'', shot largely in Mexico, and his long in-development Vietnam project ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', shot in the Philippines.\n\n''Platoon'' brought Stone's name to a much wider audience. It also finally kickstarted a busy directing career, which saw him making nine films over the next decade. Alongside some negative reaction, ''Platoon'' won many rave reviews ([[Roger Ebert]] later called it the ninth best film of the 1980s), large audiences, and Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. In 2007, a film industry vote ranked it at number 83 in an [[American Film Institute]] \"[[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]]\" poll of the previous century's best American movies. British TV channel [[Channel 4]] voted ''Platoon'' as the sixth greatest war film ever made.<ref>{{cite web|title=Channel 4's 100 Greatest War Movies of All Time |url=http://www.thependragon.co.uk/Channel4WarFilms.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref> In 2019, ''Platoon'' was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Chow\">{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Andrew R. |date=December 11, 2019 |title=See the 25 New Additions to the National Film Registry, From Purple Rain to Clerks |url=https://time.com/5747503/national-film-registry-2019-additions/ |magazine=Time |location=New York, NY |access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Platoon'' was the first of three films Stone has made about the [[Vietnam War]]: the others were ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' and ''[[Heaven & Earth (1993 film)|Heaven & Earth]]'', each dealing with different aspects of the war. ''Platoon'' is a semi-autobiographical film about Stone's experience in combat; ''Born on the Fourth of July'' is based on the [[Born on the Fourth of July|autobiography]] of US Marine turned peace campaigner [[Ron Kovic]]; ''Heaven & Earth'' is based on the memoir ''[[When Heaven and Earth Changed Places]]'', in which [[Le Ly Hayslip]] recalls her life as a Vietnamese village girl drastically affected by the war and who finds another life in the USA.\n\nStone also directed ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'', which was released in December 1987. Lead performer [[Michael Douglas]] received an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as a ruthless Wall Street corporate raider, and ''[[Talk Radio (film)|Talk Radio]]'', based on [[Eric Bogosian]]'s Pulitzer-nominated play.\n\n===1990s===\n''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', released in 1991, received criticism from former Doors keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] during a question and answer session at [[Indiana University East]] in 1997. During the discussion, Manzarek stated that he sat down with Stone about [[The Doors]] and [[Jim Morrison]] for over 12 hours. [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison]]\u2014a rock critic and author\u2014was a consultant on the movie, in which she makes a cameo appearance, but she writes in her memoir ''[[Strange Days: My Life With and Without Jim Morrison]]'' (Dutton, 1992) that Stone ignored everything she told him and proceeded with his own version of events. From the moment the movie was released, she blasted it as untruthful and inaccurate.<ref>\"She Slams 'Doors' on Portrayal,\" ''[[New York Post]]'', (March 1991)</ref> The other surviving former members of the band, [[John Densmore]] and [[Robby Krieger]], also cooperated with the filming of ''Doors'', but Krieger distanced himself from the work before the film's release. However, Densmore thought highly of the film, and in fact celebrated its DVD release on a panel with Oliver Stone.\n\nDuring this same period, Stone directed one of his most ambitious, controversial and successful films: ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', that depicts the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963. In 1991, Stone showed ''JFK'' to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on [[Capitol Hill]], which helped lead to passage of the Assassination Materials Disclosure Act<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:SJ00282:@@@D&summ2=m& |title=Bill Summary & Status \u2013 102nd Congress (1991\u20131992) \u2013 S.J.RES.282 \u2013 CRS Summary&nbsp;\u2013 THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}</ref> of 1992.

Before it was released, the [[MPAA]] gave the film a NC-17 rating; this caused Stone to cut four minutes of film footage in order to obtain an R rating (he eventually released the unrated version on VHS and DVD in 2001). The film was the recipient of the Grand Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000681/1994/1/|title=Venice Film Festival (1994)|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref> that year.\n\nStone went on to direct the 1995 [[Richard Nixon]] biopic ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'', which was nominated for Oscars for script, [[John Williams]]' score, [[Joan Allen]] as Pat Nixon and [[Anthony Hopkins]]' portrait of the title role. Stone followed ''Nixon'' with the 1997 road movie/film noir, ''[[U Turn (1997 film)|U Turn]]'', and 1999's ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'', a film about power struggles within and without an [[American football]] team.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:Oliver Stone and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.jpg|thumb|Stone and [[Argentina]]'s President [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]], January 14, 2009]]\nAfter a period from 1986 to 1999, where he released a new film at least every 1\u20132 years, Stone slowed down in the 2000s, though still finding some success.\n\nIn 2004, Stone directed the critically savaged ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]''.

Like his contemporary Michael Mann, Stone is unusual in having written or co-written most of the films he has directed. In 1986, Stone directed two films back to back: the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]'', shot largely in Mexico, and his long in-development Vietnam project ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', shot in the Philippines.\n\n''Platoon'' brought Stone's name to a much wider audience. It also finally kickstarted a busy directing career, which saw him making nine films over the next decade. Alongside some negative reaction, ''Platoon'' won many rave reviews ([[Roger Ebert]] later called it the ninth best film of the 1980s), large audiences, and Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. In 2007, a film industry vote ranked it at number 83 in an [[American Film Institute]] \"[[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]]\" poll of the previous century's best American movies. British TV channel [[Channel 4]] voted ''Platoon'' as the sixth greatest war film ever made.<ref>{{cite web|title=Channel 4's 100 Greatest War Movies of All Time |url=http://www.thependragon.co.uk/Channel4WarFilms.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref> In 2019, ''Platoon'' was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Chow\">{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Andrew R. |date=December 11, 2019 |title=See the 25 New Additions to the National Film Registry, From Purple Rain to Clerks |url=https://time.com/5747503/national-film-registry-2019-additions/ |magazine=Time |location=New York, NY |access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Platoon'' was the first of three films Stone has made about the [[Vietnam War]]: the others were ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' and ''[[Heaven & Earth (1993 film)|Heaven & Earth]]'', each dealing with different aspects of the war. ''Platoon'' is a semi-autobiographical film about Stone's experience in combat; ''Born on the Fourth of July'' is based on the [[Born on the Fourth of July|autobiography]] of US Marine turned peace campaigner [[Ron Kovic]]; ''Heaven & Earth'' is based on the memoir ''[[When Heaven and Earth Changed Places]]'', in which [[Le Ly Hayslip]] recalls her life as a Vietnamese village girl drastically affected by the war and who finds another life in the USA.\n\nStone also directed ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'', which was released in December 1987. Lead performer [[Michael Douglas]] received an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as a ruthless Wall Street corporate raider, and ''[[Talk Radio (film)|Talk Radio]]'', based on [[Eric Bogosian]]'s Pulitzer-nominated play.\n\n===1990s===\n''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', released in 1991, received criticism from former Doors keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] during a question and answer session at [[Indiana University East]] in 1997. During the discussion, Manzarek stated that he sat down with Stone about [[The Doors]] and [[Jim Morrison]] for over 12 hours. [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison]]\u2014a rock critic and author\u2014was a consultant on the movie, in which she makes a cameo appearance, but she writes in her memoir ''[[Strange Days: My Life With and Without Jim Morrison]]'' (Dutton, 1992) that Stone ignored everything she told him and proceeded with his own version of events. From the moment the movie was released, she blasted it as untruthful and inaccurate.<ref>\"She Slams 'Doors' on Portrayal,\" ''[[New York Post]]'', (March 1991)</ref> The other surviving former members of the band, [[John Densmore]] and [[Robby Krieger]], also cooperated with the filming of ''Doors'', but Krieger distanced himself from the work before the film's release. However, Densmore thought highly of the film, and in fact celebrated its DVD release on a panel with Oliver Stone.\n\nDuring this same period, Stone directed one of his most ambitious, controversial and successful films: ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', that depicts the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963.

Before it was released, the [[MPAA]] gave the film a NC-17 rating; this caused Stone to cut four minutes of film footage in order to obtain an R rating (he eventually released the unrated version on VHS and DVD in 2001). The film was the recipient of the Grand Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000681/1994/1/|title=Venice Film Festival (1994)|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref> that year.\n\nStone went on to direct the 1995 [[Richard Nixon]] biopic ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'', which was nominated for Oscars for script, [[John Williams]]' score, [[Joan Allen]] as Pat Nixon and [[Anthony Hopkins]]' portrait of the title role.
