His 1919 book, ''Geometrische Kristallographie des Diskontinuums'', played a seminal role in the refinement of [[space group]] theory. In this book, Niggli demonstrated that although X-ray reflection conditions do not always uniquely determine the space group to which a crystal belongs, they do reveal a small number of possible space groups to which it could belong.  Niggli used morphological methods to account for internal structure and, in his 1928 ''Kristallographische und Strukturtheoretische Grundbegriffe,'' he took up what is essentially the reverse process, the task of establishing the connection between space lattices and external crystal morphology.  The great aim of his life was to integrate the whole field of [[Earth science]]s.\n\nIn 1920, Niggli became the lead scientist at the ETH's ''Institut f\u00fcr Mineralogie und Petrographie'', where he brought his systematic approach to the study of crystal morphologies using X-ray diffraction.  In 1935, Niggli and his doctoral student Werner Nowacki (1909\u20131988) determined the 73 three-dimensional arithmetic crystal classes ([[Space group|symmorphic space groups]]).  Niggli retired from the Institute in 1949. He was also professor of mineralogy at the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule and at the University of Zurich.\n\nNiggli succeeded [[Paul Heinrich von Groth|Paul Heinrich von Groth (1843\u20131927)]] as editor of ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Kristallographie]]''.\n\nIn 1948, Niggli was awarded the [[Roebling Medal]] of the [[Mineralogical Society of America]].\n\nSince 1988 the [https://naturalsciences.ch/organisations/swiss_geological_society/awards/paul_niggli_medal Paul Niggli Foundation] awards medals to outstanding Swiss mineral scientists below the age of 35 with a strong perspective for an academic career.\n\n[[Dorsum Niggli]] on the [[Moon]] was named after him.\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation\n|pmid = 13095398\n|last=LAVES\n|first=F\n|publication-date=May 1953\n|year=1953\n|title=In memoriam: Paul Niggii, 26.

The ship was built for and owned by [[Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij]] (Royal Packet Navigation Company). Op ten Noort means ''Up North''. In December of 1941 she became a [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] [[hospital ship]]. The [[Empire of Japan]] shortly after her conversion stole the ship and renamed her the '''HMHS ''Tenno Maru'''''. Before sinking her, she was renamed again to the '''HMHS ''Hikawa Maru No.2''''', after the [[Hikawa Shrine (Saitama)|Hikawa Shrine, Saitama]]. To cover up the [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]] against the ship and her medical crew, at the end of the war, she was sunk on August 17, 1945.<ref>[http://ssmaritime.com/SS-Op-Ten-Noort-plan.htm SS ''Op ten Noort, plans]</ref> \n\n==Dutch East Indies==\nAs a luxury Passenger ship, the ''Op ten Noort'' was put to service in the what was called [[Dutch East Indies]], now [[Indonesia]]. Koninklijke Paketvaart Maatschappij headquarters were in [[Java]] at this time. ''Op ten Noort'' moved both passengers and [[cargo]] on the very profitable routes. On November 9, 1927 she had here [[List of maiden voyages|maid voyage]].  Her 1927 route was from [[Singapore]] to [[Bangkok]] to [[Saigon]] to [[Manila]] to [[Maluku Island]] to [[Bali]] to [[Jakarta]]. A few years the route changed to [[Java]] to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] to [[Muntok]] to [[Belawan]] to [[Deli Serdang Regency]]. ''Op ten Noort'' had a sister ship, the SS Plancius that operated in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] also. For fourteen years she serviced these towns as luxury ship. The 130 [[First class travel|First Class]] [[Cabin (ship)|cabins]] had access to lounges, bars, [[smoking room]] and a Tropical [[Verandah]]. For the very wealthy there were two Deluxe Suites with lounge, bedroom, two bathrooms, private deck (Veranda).  She had 18 [[Travel class|Second Class]] 18 cabins. They was for day passenger a [[Tweendeck]] and a [[cafeteria]].\n\n==World war 2==\nWith the outbreak of [[World war 2]] the SS ''Op Ten Noort'' was taken over by the Royal Dutch Navy in December of 1941 as she docked in Jakarta. There she was refit into a hospital ship. She was painted all white ship, with huge red crosses. The Dutch Government officially reported the [[Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] at the [[Swedish embassy]] in [[Tokyo]] of the change to SS ''Op Ten Noort''. She was now an operational hospital ship, as thus would not be part of the war effort, that is would not transport any weapons or active troops. On February 4, 1942 The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and [[Ministry of the Navy (Japan)|Naval Ministry]] acknowledges ''Op Ten Noort'' status change though the Swedish embassy. On February 21, 1941, completed she departed on her first trip to help wounded [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. But only a few hours out of port, the ''Op Ten Noort'' was bombed by the Empire of Japan in the [[Java Sea]]. One surgeon and three nurses were killed, eleven were badly wounded. Dutch Government sent a strong note of protest of the bombing to the Japan, through the Embassy of Sweden. After repairs, on 28 February 1942 she was commandeered by the [[Japanese destroyer Amatsukaze (1939)|Japanese destroyer Amatsukaze]] near [[Bawean Island]], stopping her rescue work again. Japanese forced her crew to transport their [[POW]]s to [[List of Japanese-run internment camps during World War II|Japan POW camps]]. The first POW move was that of 59 POWs from the [[USS Perch (SS-176)|USS ''Perch'']] that were on the [[Japanese destroyer Ushio (1930)|Japanese destroyer ''Ushi'']]. By the end of March 1942 she had 970 POWs, most from the 800 survivors from [[HMS Exeter (68)|HMS ''Exeter'']] that sank on March 1, 1942.

A second dummy smokestack was added to \"hide her\". She was renamed the HMHS ''Hikawa Maru No.2''. She both served as a hospital ship and transport war cargo. For the latter part of 1944 and into 1945 she traveled from Singapore and Manila with a cargo of looted gold and other valuable Japanese conquests. The weeks before Japan surrender she arrived in Japan with gold, platinum, diamonds and gems. On August 15, 1945, the Japanese officially announce surrender. To cover up the war crimes and to hide the stolen loot, the ship was sunk on August 17, 1945, at [[Wakasa Bay]] in 400 feet of water. To sink her two 328 pound explosive charges were place in the bottom of the hull.
