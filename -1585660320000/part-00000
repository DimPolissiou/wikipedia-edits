This memo was played to all of their salesmen, and eventually found its way back to Titleist. He was then let out of his multi-year deal with [[Titleist]] 16 months early, and signed on with Callaway Golf, his current equipment sponsor.

Mickelson was the joint-leader going into the final round, but he was part of a wild finish to the tournament, in which he made major mistakes on the final hole and ended up in a tie for second place at +6 (286), one shot behind [[Geoff Ogilvy]].\n\nMickelson bogeyed the 16th hole. On the 17th hole, with the lead at +4, he missed the fairway to the left, and his drive finished inside a garbage can, from which he was granted a free drop; he parred the hole. He had a one-shot lead and was in the last group going into the final hole.\n\nNeeding a par on the 18th hole for a one-shot victory, Mickelson continued with his aggressive style of play and chose to hit a driver off the tee; he hit his shot well left of the fairway (he had only hit two of thirteen fairways previously in the round). The ball bounced off a corporate hospitality tent and settled in an area of trampled-down grass that was enclosed with trees. He decided to go for the green with his second shot, rather than play it safe and pitch out into the fairway. His ball then hit a tree, and did not advance more than {{convert|50|yd}}. His next shot plugged into the left greenside bunker.

He regained the lead at the par four 10th, when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle. However, a misjudgment at the short par three 13th saw him fly the green and make a bogey to slip one behind leader [[Justin Rose]]. Another bogey followed at the 15th, before narrowly missing a birdie putt on the 16th that would have tied Rose.

Mickelson's lone top-10 of the PGA Tour season came at the year's final major, the [[2014 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] at [[Valhalla Golf Club|Valhalla]].

The two worked together heavily in the 2015 offseason to get Mickelson's swing back.\n\nUnder Getson's guidance, Mickelson made his [[2016 PGA Tour|2016]] debut at the [[CareerBuilder Challenge]]. He shot rounds of {{nowrap|68-65-66-68}} to finish in a tie for third place at 21-under-par. It was only Mickelson's fifth top-five finish since his win at the 2013 Open Championship. The third-place finish was Mickelson's highest finish in his first worldwide start of a calendar year since he won the same event to begin the 2004 season.\n\nAt the [[AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am]], Mickelson shot rounds of {{nowrap|68-65-66-72}} to finish in solo second place, a shot behind [[Vaughn Taylor]]. Mickelson lipped out a five-foot birdie putt to force a playoff on the 72nd hole. He entered the final round with a two stroke lead, his first 54-hole lead since the 2013 U.S. Open and was seeking to end a winless drought dating back 52 worldwide events to the 2013 Open Championship.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/phil-mickelson-falls-agonisingly-short-at-pebble |title=Phil Mickelson falls agonisingly short at Pebble |date=February 15, 2016 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}</ref>\n\nMickelson shot a 63 in the opening round of [[2016 Open Championship|The Open Championship]] at [[Royal Troon Golf Club|Royal Troon]]. The round set a new course record and matched the previous major championship record for lowest round. Mickelson had a {{convert|15|ft|adj=on}} birdie putt that narrowly missed on the final hole to set a new major championship scoring record of 62.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/jul/14/the-open-2016-day-one-live |title=The Open 2016: day one \u2013 as it happened |date=July 14, 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |first1=Scott |last1=Murray |first2=Stuart |last2=Goodwin |accessdate=July 15, 2016}}</ref> He followed this up with a 69 in the second round for a 10 under par total and a one shot lead over [[Henrik Stenson]] going into the weekend. In the third round, Mickelson shot a one under 70 for a total of 11 under par to enter the final round one shot back of Stenson. Despite Mickelson's bogey-free 65 in the final round, Stenson shot 63 to win by three shots. Mickelson finished 11 strokes clear of 3rd place, a major championship record for a runner up. Mickelson's 267 total set a record score for a runner up in the British Open, and only trails Mickelson's 266 at the 2001 PGA Championship as the lowest total by a runner up in major championship history.\n\n===2017: Recovery from surgeries===\nIn the fall of 2016, Mickelson had two sports hernia surgeries. Those in the golf community expected him to miss much time recovering, however his unexpected return at the [[CareerBuilder Challenge]] was a triumphant one, leading to a T-21 finish. The next week, in San Diego, he narrowly missed an eagle putt on the 18th hole on Sunday that would've got him to 8-under par instead posting \u22127 {{nowrap|(71-72-67-71)}} to finish T14 at the [[Farmers Insurance Open]]. The following week, at the Waste Management [[Phoenix Open]], which he has won three times, he surged into contention following a Saturday 65. He played his first nine holes in 4-under 32 and sending his name to the top of the leaderboard. However, his charge faltered with bogeys at 11, 12, 14, 15, and a double bogey at the driveable 17th hole. He stumbled with a final round 71, still earning a T-16 finish, for his sixth straight top-25 finish on tour.\n\nMickelson came close to winning again at the [[FedEx St. Jude Classic]] where he had finished in second place the previous year to [[Daniel Berger (golfer)|Daniel Berger]]. He started the final round four strokes behind leaders but he quickly played himself into contention. Following a birdie at the 10th hole he vaulted to the top of leaderboard but found trouble on the 12th hole. His tee shot carried out of bounds and his fourth shot hit the water so he had to make a long putt to salvage triple-bogey. He managed to get one shot back but he finished three shots behind winner Berger, in ninth place, for the second straight year.\n\nTwo weeks later he withdrew from the U.S. Open to attend his daughter's high school graduation. A week later his longtime caddie Jim (Bones) Mackay left Mickelson in a mutual agreement.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/phil-mickelson-and-caddie-bones-part-ways |title=Phil Mickelson and caddie Bones part ways |date=June 20, 2017 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}</ref> Mickelson then missed the cut at both [[2017 Open Championship|The Open Championship]] and the [[2017 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]], shooting one of his worst rounds in a major.\n\nOn September 6, days after posting his best finish of the season of T6 at the [[Dell Technologies Championship]], Mickelson was named as a captain's pick for the [[2017 Presidents Cup|Presidents Cup]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/phil-mickelson-gets-captains-pick-for-presidents-cup |title=Phil Mickelson gets captain's pick for Presidents Cup |date=September 7, 2017 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}</ref> This maintained a streak of 23 consecutive USA teams in the Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup, dating back to 1994.\n\n===2018: Winless streak ends===\nOn March 4, 2018, Mickelson ended a winless drought that dated back to 2013, by capturing his third WGC championship at the [[2018 WGC-Mexico Championship|WGC-Mexico Championship]], with a final round score of 66 and a total score of \u221216. Mickelson birdied two of his last four holes and had a lengthy putt to win outright on the 72nd hole, but tied with [[Justin Thomas (golfer)|Justin Thomas]]. He defeated Thomas on the first extra hole of a sudden-death playoff with a par. After Thomas had flown the green, Mickelson had a birdie to win the playoff which lipped out. Thomas however could not get up and down for par, meaning Mickelson claimed the championship. The win was Mickelson's 43rd on the PGA Tour and his first since winning the [[2013 Open Championship]].

This memo was played to all of their salesmen, and eventually found its way back to Titleist. He was then let out of his multi-year deal with [[Titleist]] 16 months early, and signed on with Callaway Golf, his current equipment sponsor. He endured a great deal of ridicule and scrutiny from the press and fellow Ryder Cup members for his equipment change so close to the Ryder Cup matches.

Mickelson was the joint-leader going into the final round, but he was part of a wild finish to the tournament, in which he made major mistakes on the final hole and ended up in a tie for second place at +6 (286), one shot behind [[Geoff Ogilvy]].\n\nMickelson bogeyed the 16th hole. On the 17th hole, with the lead at +4, he missed the fairway to the left, and his drive finished inside a garbage can, from which he was granted a free drop; he parred the hole. He had a one-shot lead and was in the last group going into the final hole.\n\nNeeding a par on the 18th hole for a one-shot victory, Mickelson continued with his aggressive style of play and chose to hit a driver off the tee; he hit his shot well left of the fairway (he had only hit two of thirteen fairways previously in the round). The ball bounced off a corporate hospitality tent and settled in an area of trampled-down grass that was enclosed with trees. He decided to go for the green with his second shot, rather than play it safe and pitch out into the fairway. His ball then hit a tree, and did not advance more than {{convert|50|yd}}. His next shot plugged into the left greenside bunker.

He regained the lead at the par four 10th, when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle. However, a misjudgment at the short par three 13th saw him fly the green and make a bogey to slip one behind leader [[Justin Rose]]. Another bogey followed at the 15th, before narrowly missing a birdie putt on the 16th that would have tied Rose.

He failed to contend at the [[2014 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] at Pinehurst in his first bid to complete the career grand slam. Mickelson's lone top-10 of the PGA Tour season came at the year's final major, the [[2014 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] at [[Valhalla Golf Club|Valhalla]]. Mickelson shot rounds of 69-67-67-66 to finish solo second, one shot behind world number one [[Rory McIlroy]].\n\nPrior to the [[2015 Masters Tournament|2015 Masters]], Mickelson's best finish in [[2015 PGA Tour|2015]] was a tie for 17th. At the Masters, Mickelson shot rounds of {{nowrap|70-68-67-69}} to finish tied for second with [[Justin Rose]], four shots behind champion [[Jordan Spieth]].

In the final round, Mickelson birdied the 15th hole to move to 10 under and within two of the lead. After a missed {{convert|10|ft|adj=on}} birdie putt on 16, Mickelson hit his drive on the infamous Road Hole (17th) at the famed [[Old Course at St Andrews]] onto a second floor balcony of the Old Course Hotel. The out of bounds drive lead to a triple bogey 7 that sent Mickelson tumbling out of contention.\n\nLater in the year, it was announced that Mickelson would leave longtime swing coach Butch Harmon, feeling as though he needed to hear a new perspective on things.\n\n===2016: New swing coach===\nAfter leaving Butch Harmon, Mickelson hired Andrew Getson of Grayhawk Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona, to serve as his new swing coach. The two worked together heavily in the 2015 offseason to get Mickelson's swing back.\n\nUnder Getson's guidance, Mickelson made his [[2016 PGA Tour|2016]] debut at the [[CareerBuilder Challenge]]. He shot rounds of {{nowrap|68-65-66-68}} to finish in a tie for third place at 21-under-par. It was only Mickelson's fifth top-five finish since his win at the 2013 Open Championship. The third-place finish was Mickelson's highest finish in his first worldwide start of a calendar year since he won the same event to begin the 2004 season.\n\nAt the [[AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am]], Mickelson shot rounds of {{nowrap|68-65-66-72}} to finish in solo second place, a shot behind [[Vaughn Taylor]]. Mickelson lipped out a five-foot birdie putt to force a playoff on the 72nd hole.

Despite Mickelson's bogey-free 65 in the final round, Stenson shot 63 to win by three shots. Mickelson finished 11 strokes clear of 3rd place, a major championship record for a runner up. Mickelson's 267 total set a record score for a runner up in the British Open, and only trails Mickelson's 266 at the 2001 PGA Championship as the lowest total by a runner up in major championship history.\n\n===2017: Recovery from surgeries===\nIn the fall of 2016, Mickelson had two sports hernia surgeries. Those in the golf community expected him to miss much time recovering, however his unexpected return at the [[CareerBuilder Challenge]] was a triumphant one, leading to a T-21 finish. The next week, in San Diego, he narrowly missed an eagle putt on the 18th hole on Sunday that would've got him to 8-under par instead posting \u22127 {{nowrap|(71-72-67-71)}} to finish T14 at the [[Farmers Insurance Open]]. The following week, at the Waste Management [[Phoenix Open]], which he has won three times, he surged into contention following a Saturday 65.

However, his charge faltered with bogeys at 11, 12, 14, 15, and a double bogey at the driveable 17th hole. He stumbled with a final round 71, still earning a T-16 finish, for his sixth straight top-25 finish on tour.\n\nMickelson came close to winning again at the [[FedEx St. Jude Classic]] where he had finished in second place the previous year to [[Daniel Berger (golfer)|Daniel Berger]].

Following a birdie at the 10th hole he vaulted to the top of leaderboard but found trouble on the 12th hole. His tee shot carried out of bounds and his fourth shot hit the water so he had to make a long putt to salvage triple-bogey.

{"title_page": "Buddhi Vardhak Sabha", "text_new": "The '''Buddhi Vardhak Sabha''' (Society for Advancement of Knowledge), also known as the '''Buddhi Vardhak Hindu Sabha''', was a socio-religious reform organization in [[Bombay]], in [[British India]] (now Mumbai). It was founded in 1851 by the members of another Bombay reform association, the Jnayan Prasarak Mandali, whose members included Narmadashankar Dave ([[Narmad]]) and his fellow writers. The Jnayan Prasarak Mandali, in turn, was a branch of the Students' Literary and Scientific Society of [[Elphinstone College]].\n\nThe aim and object of the Buddhi Vardhak Sabha was to work for the social welfare of the [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Hindus|Hindu]] people, and to awaken public opinion for social change through lectures, debates and writings. Other founding members included Pranlal Mathurdas, Mohanlal Ranchhoddas Jhaveri, [[Karsandas Mulji]], and [[Dalpatram]].\n\n==History==\nBombay's [[Elphinstone College#History|Elphinstone Institution]] played an instrumental role in providing an intellectual background for the [[reform movement]]s in Western India. In June 1848, its students started the Students' Literary and Scientific Society. In September 1848, two other branches of this society were established, one Gujarati, and the other [[Marathi people|Marathi]].

This can be improved by using DNA stabilizing molecules such as intercalators like ortho-TINA, which will stabilize the duplex formation. Studies show that the greatest increase in stability occurred when intercalating primers were used at the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 ends. Placement of a TINA molecule in the oligonucleotide is capable of improving the analytical sensitivity of the probe hybridization. Para-TINA molecules decreases Tm in all positions especially when at the center of the oligonucleotide, while in the ortho-TINA molecules, the improvement was seen anywhere with [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] at the center.

This can be improved by using DNA stabilizing molecules such as intercalators like ortho-TINA, which will stabilize the duplex formation. Studies show that the greatest increase in stability occurred when intercalating primers were used at the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 ends. Placement of a TINA molecule in the oligonucleotide is capable of improving the analytical sensitivity of the probe hybridization. Para-TINA molecules decreases Tm in all positions especially when at the center of the oligonucleotide, while in the ortho-TINA molecules, the improvement was seen anywhere with [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] at the center. Combination of terminal para- or ortho- molecule with an internal TINA molecule showed the highest increase of Tm. TINA molecules should be placed terminally for maximum increase in Tm. An increase in Tm increases the specificity of assays, like [[PCR]].<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1002/chem.200800380|pmid = 18810743|title = 1-, 2-, and 4-Ethynylpyrenes in the Structure of Twisted Intercalating Nucleic Acids: Structure, Thermal Stability, and Fluorescence Relationship|journal = Chemistry - A European Journal|volume = 14|issue = 32|pages = 9968\u20139980|year = 2008|last1 = Filichev|first1 = Vyacheslav V|last2 = Astakhova|first2 = Irina V|last3 = Malakhov|first3 = Andrei D|last4 = Korshun|first4 = Vladimir A|last5 = Pedersen|first5 = Erik B}}</ref>\n\n=== Anti-HIV-1 activity ===\n\nRecent studies show that the use of TINA insertions in G-quadruplexes has also been shown to enhance anti-HIV-1 activity.

Thirty extant species are described. They include several big species whose common names contain \"whale\" rather than \"dolphin\", such as the [[killer whale]] and the [[pilot whale]]s. Delphinidae is a family within the superfamily [[Delphinoidea]], which also includes the [[porpoise]]s (Phocoenidae) and the [[Monodontidae]] ([[beluga whale]] and [[narwhal]]). [[River dolphin]]s are relatives of the Delphinoidea.\n\nOceanic dolphins range in size from the {{convert|5.6|ft|m|adj=on}}-long and {{convert|110|lbs|kg|adj=on}} [[Maui's dolphin]] to the {{convert|31|ft|m|adj=on}} and {{convert|11|ST|MT|adj=on}} killer whale, the largest known dolphin. Several species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]]; the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as [[Pinniped|seal]]s, some dolphins can travel at {{convert|34.5|mph|kph|abbr=on}}. Most delphinids primarily eat fish, along with a smaller number of squid and small crustaceans, but some species specialise in eating squid, or, in the case of the killer whale, also eat marine mammals and birds. All, however, are purely [[carnivore|carnivorous]]. They typically have between 100 and 200 teeth, although a few species have considerably fewer. Delphinids travel in large pods, which may number a thousand individuals in some species. Each pod forages over a range of a few dozen to a few hundred square miles. Some pods have a loose social structure, with individuals frequently joining or leaving, but others seem to be more permanent, perhaps dominated by a male and a [[Harem (zoology)|harem]] of females.<ref name=EoM/> Individuals communicate by sound, producing low-frequency whistles, and also produce high-frequency broadband clicks of 80\u2013220 [[hertz|kHz]], which are primarily used for [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]. [[Gestation]] lasts from 10 to 18 months, and results in the birth of a single calf. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or [[blubber]], under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.\n\nAlthough oceanic dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the [[right whale dolphin]], prefer colder climates. Some have a global distribution, like the killer whale. Oceanic dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer, and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for relatively long times. Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.\n\nOceanic dolphins are sometimes hunted in places such as Japan, in an activity known as [[dolphin drive hunting]]. Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from [[bycatch]], habitat loss, and [[marine pollution]]. Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the Warner Bros film ''[[Free Willy (film series)|Free Willy]]''. Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform in shows. The most common species of dolphin in captivity is the [[bottlenose dolphin]], and less than 50 killer whales were found in [[oceanarium]]s in 2012.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{see also|List of dolphins}}\n[[File:Etruridelphis-giuliiBologna.JPG|thumb|''Etruridelphis giulii'' skull in Bologna]] \nDelphinids, especially bottlenose dolphins, are able to [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridize]] with a wide variety of other delphinid species; [[wolphins]] are just one of many possible hybrids.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/science/14creatures.html?src=me&ref=general&_r=0|title=Hybrids May Thrive Where Parents Fear to Tread |last=Carroll|first=Sean| journal=Science: Remarkable Creatures| year=2010|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nSix species, sometimes referred to as \"blackfish\", are dolphins commonly called whales: the [[killer whale]], the [[melon-headed whale]], the [[pygmy killer whale]], the [[false killer whale]], and the two species of [[pilot whale]]s, but they are classified under the family [[Delphinidae]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Leatherwood|first1=S.|last2=Prematunga|first2=W.P.|last3=Girton|first3=P.|last4=McBrearty|first4=D.|last5=Ilangakoon|first5=A.|last6=McDonald| first6=D|title=''Records of 'blackfish' (killer, false killer, pilot, pygmy killer, and melon-headed whales) in the Indian Ocean Sanctuary, 1772\u20131986 in'' Cetaceans and cetacean research in the Indian Ocean Sanctuary |pages=33\u201365|year=1991|publisher=UNEP Marine Mammal Technical Report|asin=B00KX9I8Y8}}</ref>\n\n<!-- A similar but broader list exits in the article dolphin and should be kept in sync with this one. -->\n\nRecent [[molecular phylogeny|molecular]] analyses indicate that several delphinid [[genus|genera]] (especially ''[[Stenella]]'' and ''[[Lagenorhynchus]]'') are not [[monophyly|monophyletic]] as currently recognized.<ref name=LeDuc1999>{{Cite journal | last1 = LeDuc | first1 = R.G. | last2 = Perrin | first2 = W.F. | last3 = Dizon | first3 = A.E. | title = Phylogenetic relationships among the delphinid cetaceans based on full cytochrome ''b'' sequences |date=July 1999 | journal = Marine Mammal Science | volume = 15  | issue = 3 | pages = 619\u2013648 | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-7692.1999.tb00833.x | issn = 0824-0469}}</ref> Thus, significant taxonomic revisions within the family are likely.<ref name=Hassanin2012>{{cite journal | author = Hassanin, A.| year = 2012 | title = Pattern and timing of diversification of Cetartiodactyla (Mammalia, Laurasiatheria), as revealed by a comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial genomes | journal = Comptes Rendus Biologies | volume = 335 | issue = 1 | pages = 32\u201350 | doi = 10.1016/j.crvi.2011.11.002|display-authors=etal | pmid=22226162}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n!

As well as this, the eyes of a dolphin are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both [[rod cell|rod]] and [[cone cell|cone]] cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Dolphins do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for color vision than most mammals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mass|first=Alla M.|last2=Supin|first2=Alexander Ya|title=Adaptive features of aquatic mammals' eye|journal=Anatomical Record (Hoboken, N.J.: 2007)|volume=290|issue=6|pages=701\u2013715|doi=10.1002/ar.20529|issn=1932-8486|pmid=17516421|year=2007}}</ref> Most dolphins have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a [[tapetum lucidum]]; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. They also have glands on the eyelids and [[corneal epithelium|outer corneal layer]] that act as protection for the cornea.<ref name=\"Dolphin senses\"/>\n\nThe [[olfactory lobes]] are absent in oceanic dolphins, suggesting that they have no sense of smell.<ref name=\"Dolphin senses\"/>\n\nOceanic dolphins are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether.  However, some have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.<ref name=\"Dolphin senses\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\n\n===Feeding===\nMost delphinids primarily eat fish, along with a smaller number of squid and small crustaceans, but some species specialize in eating squid, or, in the case of the killer whale, also eat marine mammals and birds. All, however, are purely [[carnivore|carnivorous]]. They typically have between 100 and 200 teeth, although a few species have considerably fewer. Various methods of feeding exist among and within oceanic species, some apparently exclusive to a single population. Fish and squid are the main food, but the [[false killer whale]] and the killer whale also feed on other marine mammals. Killer whales on occasion also hunt [[whale]]s larger than themselves.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/plants-animals/2012/01/killer-whale-menu-finally-revealed |title=Killer Whale Menu Finally Revealed |author=Morrel, Virginia |journal=Science |date=30 January 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a [[bait ball]]. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it, a behavior known as beach or strand feeding. Some species also whack fish with their flukes, stunning them and sometimes knocking them out of the water.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coastal Stock(s) of Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin: Status Review and Management Proceedings and Recommendations from a Workshop held in Beaufort, North Carolina, 13 September 1993&nbsp;\u2013 14 September 1993 |url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/species/coastalbottlenosestock.pdf|work=U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service|pages=56\u201357}}</ref>\n\n===Vocalizations===\n{{Main|Whale vocalisation}}\nOceanic dolphins are capable of making a broad range of sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole.

The clicks are directional and are for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. Dolphin echolocation clicks are amongst the [[Whale sound|loudest sounds made by marine animals]].<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Sonar of Dolphins|last1= Au |first1=W. W.

The signature whistle of a male bottlenose dolphin tends to be similar to that of his mother, while the signature whistle of a female bottlenose dolphin tends to be more distinguishable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whoi.edu/science/B/people/kamaral/marinemammalacoustics.html |title=Marine Mammal vocalizations: language or behavior? |date=August 24, 2013}}</ref> Bottlenose dolphins have a strong memory when it comes to these signature whistles, as they are able to relate to a signature whistle of an individual they have not encountered for over twenty years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2013/08/06/dolphins-keep-lifelong-social-memories-longest-non-human-species |title=Dolphins keep lifelong social memories, longest in a non-human species |date=August 24, 2013}}</ref> Research done on signature whistle usage by other dolphin species is relatively limited.

Albacore are not netted this way, making albacore the only truly dolphin-safe tuna.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time Of Truth For US Dolphin Safe Logos |url=http://www.atuna.com/NewsArchive/ViewArticle.asp?ID=12719 |website=atuna |accessdate=29 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015221118/http://www.atuna.com/NewsArchive/ViewArticle.asp?ID=12719 |archivedate=15 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n====Sonar====\nLoud underwater noises, such as those resulting from [[navy|naval]] [[sonar]] use, live firing exercises, and certain [[offshore construction]] projects such as [[wind farm]]s, may be harmful to dolphins, increasing stress, damaging hearing, and causing [[decompression sickness]] by forcing them to surface too quickly to escape the noise.<ref>{{cite news|title= Navy sonar may be killing whales, dolphins|author=CBC news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2003/10/09/sonar031009.html|accessdate= October 27, 2008|work=CBC News|date=2003-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Npower renewables Underwater noise & vibration, section 9.4 |url=http://www.natwindpower.co.uk/northhoyle/pdfs/fepa/chapter9.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070722160651/http://www.natwindpower.co.uk/northhoyle/pdfs/fepa/chapter9.pdf|archivedate=2007-07-22|accessdate= October 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===In captivity===\n{{Main|Cetaceans in captivity}}\n[[File:Sea World1.jpg|thumb|SeaWorld show featuring [[bottlenose dolphin]]s and [[false killer whale]]s]]\nThe renewed popularity of dolphins in the 1960s resulted in the appearance of many [[dolphinarium|dolphinaria]] around the world, making dolphins accessible to the public. Criticism and [[animal welfare]] laws forced many to close, although hundreds still exist around the world. In the [[United States]], the best known are the [[SeaWorld]] [[marine mammal park]]s.\nIn the Middle East the best known are [[Dolphin Bay]] at [[Atlantis, The Palm]] and the [[Dubai Dolphinarium]].\n\nVarious species of dolphins are kept in captivity. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks, such as [[SeaWorld]], commonly known as a [[dolphinarium]]. [[Bottlenose dolphin]]s are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Other species kept in captivity are [[Atlantic spotted dolphin|spotted dolphins]], [[false killer whale]]s and [[common dolphin]]s, [[Commerson's dolphin]]s, as well as [[rough-toothed dolphin]]s, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. There are also fewer than ten [[pilot whale]]s, [[Amazon river dolphin]]s, [[Risso's dolphin]]s, [[spinner dolphin]]s, or [[tucuxi]] in captivity. Two unusual and very rare [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] dolphins, known as [[wolphins]], are kept at the Sea Life Park in [[Hawaii]], which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a [[false killer whale]]. Also, two [[Common dolphin|common]]/bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity: one at [[Discovery Cove]] and the other at [[SeaWorld San Diego]].<ref name=\"Dolphins\"/>\n\n[[Killer whale]]s are well known for their performances in shows, but the number of orcas kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with only 44 [[List of captive orcas|captive killer whales]] being held in aquaria as of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orcahome.de/orcastat.htm| title=Orcas in Captivity \u2013 A look at killer whales in aquariums and parks|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref> The killer whale's [[animal intelligence|intelligence]], trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.<ref name=\"Dolphins\"/>\n\n===In history and mythology===\n{{expand section|date=November 2015|Vikings and other coastal civilizations}}\n[[File:Akrotiri dolphins.jpg|thumb|Fresco of dolphins, {{circa}} 1600 BC, from [[Knossos]], [[Crete]]]]\n\nIn [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]], they were seen invariably as helpers of humankind.

After the ship set sail Dionysus invoked his divine powers, causing vines to overgrow the ship where the mast and sails had been.  He turned the oars into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that they jumped overboard, but Dionysus took pity on them and [[shapeshifting|transformed]] them into dolphins so that they would spend their lives providing help for those in need. Dolphins were also the messengers of [[Poseidon]] and sometimes did errands for him as well. Dolphins were sacred to both [[Aphrodite]] and [[Apollo]].\n\nDolphins are sometimes used as symbols, for instance in heraldry. When heraldry developed in the [[Middle Ages]], not much was known about the biology of the dolphin and it was often depicted as a sort of fish. Traditionally, the dolphins in heraldry still may take after this notion, sometimes showing the dolphin skin covered with [[fish scale]]s.\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the dolphin became an important [[Heraldry|heraldic element]] in the coats of arms of several European noble families, the most noticeable being those of the [[List of counts of Albon and dauphins of Viennois|Dauphin de Viennois]] (later [[Dauphin of France]]) through which it passed to the [[Forez|Counts of Forez]], [[List of counts of Albon and dauphins of Viennois|Albon]] and other French families, as well as several branches of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon family]] ([[Duchy of Montpensier|Count of Montpensier]], [[Louis Charles, Count of Beaujolais|Count of Beaujolais]], among others) the [[House of Pandolfini|Pandolfini]] of Florence, and the [[Delfini (family)|Delfini]] of Venice and Rome also used the dolphin as their \"canting\" armories.

Thirty extant species are described. They include several big species whose common names contain \"whale\" rather than \"dolphin\", such as the [[killer whale]] and the [[pilot whale]]s. Delphinidae is a family within the superfamily [[Delphinoidea]], which also includes the [[porpoise]]s (Phocoenidae) and the [[Monodontidae]] ([[beluga whale]] and [[narwhal]]). [[River dolphin]]s are relatives of the Delphinoidea.\n\nOceanic dolphins range in size from the {{convert|5.6|ft|m|adj=on}}-long and {{convert|110|lbs|kg|adj=on}} [[Maui's dolphin]] to the {{convert|31|ft|m|adj=on}} and {{convert|11|ST|MT|adj=on}} killer whale, the largest known dolphin. Several species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]]; the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as [[Pinniped|seal]]s, some dolphins can travel at {{convert|34.5|mph|kph|abbr=on}}. Most delphinids primarily eat fish, along with a smaller number of squid and small crustaceans, but some species specialise in eating squid, or, in the case of the killer whale, also eat marine mammals and birds. All, however, are purely [[carnivore|carnivorous]]. They typically have between 100 and 200 teeth, although a few species have considerably fewer. Delphinids travel in large pods, which may number a thousand individuals in some species. Each pod forages over a range of a few dozen to a few hundred square miles. Some pods have a loose social structure, with individuals frequently joining or leaving, but others seem to be more permanent, perhaps dominated by a male and a [[Harem (zoology)|harem]] of females.<ref name=EoM/> Individuals communicate by sound, producing low-frequency whistles, and also produce high-frequency broadband clicks of 80\u2013220 [[hertz|kHz]], which are primarily used for [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]. [[Gestation]] lasts from 10 to 18 months, and results in the birth of a single calf. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or [[blubber]], under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.\n\nAlthough oceanic dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the [[right whale dolphin]], prefer colder climates. Some have a global distribution, like the killer whale. Oceanic dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer, and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for relatively long times. Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.\n\nOceanic dolphins are sometimes hunted in places such as Japan, in an activity known as [[dolphin drive hunting]]. Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from [[bycatch]], habitat loss, and [[marine pollution]]. Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the Warner Bros film ''[[Free Willy (film series)|Free Willy]]''. Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform in shows. The most common species of dolphin in captivity is the [[bottlenose dolphin]], and less than 50 killer whales were found in [[oceanarium]]s in 2012.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{see also|List of dolphins}}\n[[File:Etruridelphis-giuliiBologna.JPG|thumb|''Etruridelphis giulii'' skull in Bologna]] \nDelphinids, especially bottlenose dolphins, are able to [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridize]] with a wide variety of other delphinid species; [[wolphins]] are just one of many possible hybrids.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/science/14creatures.html?src=me&ref=general&_r=0|title=Hybrids May Thrive Where Parents Fear to Tread |last=Carroll|first=Sean| journal=Science: Remarkable Creatures| year=2010|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nSix species, sometimes referred to as \"blackfish\", are dolphins commonly called whales: the [[killer whale]], the [[melon-headed whale]], the [[pygmy killer whale]], the [[false killer whale]], and the two species of [[pilot whale]]s, but they are classified under the family [[Delphinidae]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Leatherwood|first1=S.|last2=Prematunga|first2=W.P.|last3=Girton|first3=P.|last4=McBrearty|first4=D.|last5=Ilangakoon|first5=A.|last6=McDonald| first6=D|title=''Records of 'blackfish' (killer, false killer, pilot, pygmy killer, and melon-headed whales) in the Indian Ocean Sanctuary, 1772\u20131986 in'' Cetaceans and cetacean research in the Indian Ocean Sanctuary |pages=33\u201365|year=1991|publisher=UNEP Marine Mammal Technical Report|asin=B00KX9I8Y8}}</ref>\n\n<!-- A similar but broader list exits in the article dolphin and should be kept in sync with this one. -->\n\nRecent [[molecular phylogeny|molecular]] analyses indicate that several delphinid [[genus|genera]] (especially ''[[Stenella]]'' and ''[[Lagenorhynchus]]'') are not [[monophyly|monophyletic]] as currently recognized.<ref name=LeDuc1999>{{Cite journal | last1 = LeDuc | first1 = R.G. | last2 = Perrin | first2 = W.F. | last3 = Dizon | first3 = A.E. | title = Phylogenetic relationships among the delphinid cetaceans based on full cytochrome ''b'' sequences |date=July 1999 | journal = Marine Mammal Science | volume = 15  | issue = 3 | pages = 619\u2013648 | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-7692.1999.tb00833.x | issn = 0824-0469}}</ref> Thus, significant taxonomic revisions within the family are likely.<ref name=Hassanin2012>{{cite journal | author = Hassanin, A.| year = 2012 | title = Pattern and timing of diversification of Cetartiodactyla (Mammalia, Laurasiatheria), as revealed by a comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial genomes | journal = Comptes Rendus Biologies | volume = 335 | issue = 1 | pages = 32\u201350 | doi = 10.1016/j.crvi.2011.11.002|display-authors=etal | pmid=22226162}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n!

Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with lanugos.<ref name=\"Cetacean anatomy\"/><ref name=\"Dolphins\"/>\n\n===Locomotion===\nOceanic dolphins have two flippers on the underside toward the head, a [[dorsal fin]], and a tail fin. These flippers contain four digits. Although oceanic dolphins do not possess fully developed hind limbs, some possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Oceanic dolphins are fast swimmers in comparison to seals who typically cruise at {{convert|7|\u2013|17|mph|kph}}; the killer whale, in comparison, can travel at speeds of up to {{convert|34.5|mph|kph}}. The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, which means they are unable to turn their heads. Oceanic dolphins swim by moving their tail fin and rear body vertically, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Some species [[Cetacean surfacing behaviour|log]] out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers.

In dolphins, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear.

As well as this, the eyes of a dolphin are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both [[rod cell|rod]] and [[cone cell|cone]] cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Dolphins do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for color vision than most mammals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mass|first=Alla M.|last2=Supin|first2=Alexander Ya|title=Adaptive features of aquatic mammals' eye|journal=Anatomical Record (Hoboken, N.J.: 2007)|volume=290|issue=6|pages=701\u2013715|doi=10.1002/ar.20529|issn=1932-8486|pmid=17516421|year=2007}}</ref> Most dolphins have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a [[tapetum lucidum]]; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area.

However, some have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.<ref name=\"Dolphin senses\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\n\n===Feeding===\nMost delphinids primarily eat fish, along with a smaller number of squid and small crustaceans, but some species specialize in eating squid, or, in the case of the killer whale, also eat marine mammals and birds. All, however, are purely [[carnivore|carnivorous]]. They typically have between 100 and 200 teeth, although a few species have considerably fewer. Various methods of feeding exist among and within oceanic species, some apparently exclusive to a single population. Fish and squid are the main food, but the [[false killer whale]] and the killer whale also feed on other marine mammals. Killer whales on occasion also hunt [[whale]]s larger than themselves.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/plants-animals/2012/01/killer-whale-menu-finally-revealed |title=Killer Whale Menu Finally Revealed |author=Morrel, Virginia |journal=Science |date=30 January 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a [[bait ball]]. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it, a behavior known as beach or strand feeding. Some species also whack fish with their flukes, stunning them and sometimes knocking them out of the water.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coastal Stock(s) of Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin: Status Review and Management Proceedings and Recommendations from a Workshop held in Beaufort, North Carolina, 13 September 1993&nbsp;\u2013 14 September 1993 |url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/species/coastalbottlenosestock.pdf|work=U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service|pages=56\u201357}}</ref>\n\n===Vocalizations===\n{{Main|Whale vocalisation}}\nOceanic dolphins are capable of making a broad range of sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole.

The clicks are directional and are for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. Dolphin echolocation clicks are amongst the [[Whale sound|loudest sounds made by marine animals]].<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Sonar of Dolphins|last1= Au |first1=W. W.

The signature whistle of a male bottlenose dolphin tends to be similar to that of his mother, while the signature whistle of a female bottlenose dolphin tends to be more distinguishable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whoi.edu/science/B/people/kamaral/marinemammalacoustics.html |title=Marine Mammal vocalizations: language or behavior? |date=August 24, 2013}}</ref> Bottlenose dolphins have a strong memory when it comes to these signature whistles, as they are able to relate to a signature whistle of an individual they have not encountered for over twenty years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2013/08/06/dolphins-keep-lifelong-social-memories-longest-non-human-species |title=Dolphins keep lifelong social memories, longest in a non-human species |date=August 24, 2013}}</ref> Research done on signature whistle usage by other dolphin species is relatively limited.

Criticism and [[animal welfare]] laws forced many to close, although hundreds still exist around the world. In the [[United States]], the best known are the [[SeaWorld]] [[marine mammal park]]s.\nIn the Middle East the best known are [[Dolphin Bay]] at [[Atlantis, The Palm]] and the [[Dubai Dolphinarium]].\n\nVarious species of dolphins are kept in captivity. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks, such as [[SeaWorld]], commonly known as a [[dolphinarium]]. [[Bottlenose dolphin]]s are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Other species kept in captivity are [[Atlantic spotted dolphin|spotted dolphins]], [[false killer whale]]s and [[common dolphin]]s, [[Commerson's dolphin]]s, as well as [[rough-toothed dolphin]]s, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. There are also fewer than ten [[pilot whale]]s, [[Amazon river dolphin]]s, [[Risso's dolphin]]s, [[spinner dolphin]]s, or [[tucuxi]] in captivity. Two unusual and very rare [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] dolphins, known as [[wolphins]], are kept at the Sea Life Park in [[Hawaii]], which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a [[false killer whale]]. Also, two [[Common dolphin|common]]/bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity: one at [[Discovery Cove]] and the other at [[SeaWorld San Diego]].<ref name=\"Dolphins\"/>\n\n[[Killer whale]]s are well known for their performances in shows, but the number of orcas kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with only 44 [[List of captive orcas|captive killer whales]] being held in aquaria as of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orcahome.de/orcastat.htm| title=Orcas in Captivity \u2013 A look at killer whales in aquariums and parks|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref> The killer whale's [[animal intelligence|intelligence]], trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.<ref name=\"Dolphins\"/>\n\n===In history and mythology===\n{{expand section|date=November 2015|Vikings and other coastal civilizations}}\n[[File:Akrotiri dolphins.jpg|thumb|Fresco of dolphins, {{circa}} 1600 BC, from [[Knossos]], [[Crete]]]]\n\nIn [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]], they were seen invariably as helpers of humankind. Dolphins also seem to have been important to the [[Minoans]], judging by artistic evidence from the ruined palace at [[Knossos]].

A dolphin rescued the poet [[Arion]] from drowning and carried him safe to land, at [[Cape Matapan]], a promontory forming the southernmost point of the [[Peloponnesus]]. There was a temple to [[Poseidon]] and a statue of Arion riding the dolphin.<ref>[[Herodotus]] I.23; [[Thucydides]] I.128, 133; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] iii.25, 4</ref>\n\n[[Dionysus]] was once captured by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[pirate]]s who mistook him for a wealthy prince they could ransom. After the ship set sail Dionysus invoked his divine powers, causing vines to overgrow the ship where the mast and sails had been.  He turned the oars into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that they jumped overboard, but Dionysus took pity on them and [[shapeshifting|transformed]] them into dolphins so that they would spend their lives providing help for those in need. Dolphins were also the messengers of [[Poseidon]] and sometimes did errands for him as well. Dolphins were sacred to both [[Aphrodite]] and [[Apollo]].\n\nDolphins are sometimes used as symbols, for instance in heraldry. When heraldry developed in the [[Middle Ages]], not much was known about the biology of the dolphin and it was often depicted as a sort of fish. Traditionally, the dolphins in heraldry still may take after this notion, sometimes showing the dolphin skin covered with [[fish scale]]s.\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the dolphin became an important [[Heraldry|heraldic element]] in the coats of arms of several European noble families, the most noticeable being those of the [[List of counts of Albon and dauphins of Viennois|Dauphin de Viennois]] (later [[Dauphin of France]]) through which it passed to the [[Forez|Counts of Forez]], [[List of counts of Albon and dauphins of Viennois|Albon]] and other French families, as well as several branches of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon family]] ([[Duchy of Montpensier|Count of Montpensier]], [[Louis Charles, Count of Beaujolais|Count of Beaujolais]], among others) the [[House of Pandolfini|Pandolfini]] of Florence, and the [[Delfini (family)|Delfini]] of Venice and Rome also used the dolphin as their \"canting\" armories. In the 19th century, [[Joseph Bonaparte]] adopted a dolphin in his coat of arms as King of Naples and Sicily.\n\nIn contemporary days, a dolphin is still used in the coat of arms of many cities, as well as in the [[coat of arms of Anguilla]] and the [[coat of arms of Romania]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Brief Romanian Military History|last=Hentea|first=C\u0103lin|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8108-5820-6|location=Maryland, USA|page=91}}</ref> and the [[coat of arms of Barbados]] has a dolphin [[supporter]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Barbados: Just Beyond Your Imagination|last=Ali|first=Arif|publisher=Hansib Publications|year=1996|isbn=978-1-870518-54-3|location=Hertford, UK|page=16}}</ref> [[Angelo Amato|Cardinal Angelo Amato]], prefect of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints|Congregation of the Causes of Saints]], a dolphin in his coat of arms, as well as [[Godfried Danneels|Cardinal Godfried Danneels]], former [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels|Metropolitan Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n* {{cite journal | last1 = May-Collado | first1 = L. | last2 = Agnarsson | first2 = I. | year = 2006 | title = Cytochrome ''b'' and Bayesian inference of whale phylogeny | url = | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 344\u2013354 | doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.09.019 | pmid=16325433}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027174803/http://cf.geocities.com/orque_orca/  Site sur les differents orques et leur mode de reproduction \u00e9vitant la consanguinit\u00e9.] {{in lang|fr}}\n\n{{Cetacea|O.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q215760}}\n\n[[Category:Oceanic dolphins| ]]\n[[Category:Extant Chattian first appearances]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c5:71b1:1300:9870:6290:d4bb:eefc", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_dolphin"}

The cup-bearer's dream was about a vine with three branches that was budding. And as it was budding, its blossoms came out and they produced grapes. The cup-bearer took those grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand. Joseph interpreted this dream as the cup-bearer being restored as cup-bearer to the Pharaoh within three days. The baker's dream was about three baskets full of bread for the Pharaoh, and birds were eating the bread out of those baskets. Joseph interpreted this dream as the baker being hanged within three days and having his flesh eaten by birds.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|40:5-22|HE}}</ref> Joseph requested that the cup-bearer mention him to Pharaoh to secure his release from prison,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|40:14-15|HE}}</ref> but the cup-bearer, reinstalled in office, forgot Joseph.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|40:23|HE}}</ref> After two more years, the Pharaoh dreamt of seven lean cows which devoured seven fat cows; and of seven withered ears of grain which devoured seven fat ears.

In the sixth year, Asenath bore two children to Joseph: [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]] and [[Ephraim]]. When the famine came, it was so severe that people from surrounding nations came to Egypt to buy bread. The narrative also indicates that they went straight to Joseph or were directed to him, even by the Pharaoh himself. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|41:37-57|HE}}) As a last resort, all of the inhabitants of Egypt, less the Egyptian priestly class, sold their properties and later themselves (as slaves) to Joseph for seed; wherefore Joseph set a mandate that, because the people would be sowing and harvesting seed on government property, a fifth of the produce should go to the Pharaoh.

Joseph placed his brothers in prison for three days. On the third day, he brought them out of prison to reiterate that he wanted their youngest brother brought to Egypt to demonstrate their veracity. The brothers conferred amongst themselves speaking in Hebrew, reflecting on the wrong they had done to Joseph. Joseph understood what they were saying and removed himself from their presence because he was caught in emotion.

They also discovered that all of their money sacks still had money in them, and they were dismayed. Then they informed their father that the Vizier demanded that Benjamin be brought before him to demonstrate that they were honest men. Jacob became greatly distressed feeling that they treated him badly. After they had consumed all of the grain that they brought back from Egypt, Jacob told his sons to go back to Egypt for more grain. With Reuben and Judah's persistence, they persuaded their father to let Benjamin join them for fear of Egyptian retribution.

Mortier\u2019s Bible.jpg|thumb|Joseph's cup found in Benjamin's sack, illustration by Philip De Vere]]\nUpon their return to Egypt, the brothers were received by the steward of the house of Joseph. When they were brought to Joseph's house, they were apprehensive about the returned money in their money sacks. They thought that the missed transaction would somehow be used against them as way to induct them as slaves and confiscate their possessions. So they immediately informed the steward of what had transpired to get a feel of the situation. The steward put them at ease, telling them not to worry about the money, and brought out their brother Simeon. Then he brought the brothers into the house of Joseph and received them hospitably. When the Vizier (Joseph) appeared, they gave him gifts from their father. Joseph saw and inquired of Benjamin and was overcome by emotion but did not show it. He withdrew to his chambers and wept. When he regained control of himself, he returned and ordered a meal to be served. The Egyptians would not dine with Hebrews at the same table, as doing so was considered loathsome, so the sons of Israel were served at a separate table. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|43:16-44:34|HE}})\n\nThat night, Joseph ordered his steward to load the brothers' donkeys with food and all their money. The money they brought was double what they had from the first trip. Deceptively, Joseph also ordered that his silver cup be put in Benjamin's sack. The following morning the brothers began their journey back to Canaan. Joseph ordered the steward to go after the brothers and question them about the \"missing\" silver cup. When the steward caught up with the brothers, he seized them and searched their sacks. The steward found the cup in Benjamin's sack just as he had planted it the night before. This caused a stir amongst the brothers. However, they agreed to be escorted back to Egypt. When the Vizier (Joseph) confronted them about the silver cup, he demanded that the one who possessed the cup in his bag become his slave. In response, Judah pleaded with the Vizier that Benjamin be allowed to return to his father, and he himself be kept in Benjamin's place as a slave. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|44|HE}})\n\n===Family reunited===\n\n{{see also|Jacob#Jacob in Egypt|l1=Jacob in Egypt}}\n[[File:Joseph weeps.JPG|thumb|left|Joseph [[weep]]s]]\nJudah appealed to the Vizier begging that Benjamin be released and that he be enslaved in his stead, because of the silver cup found in Benjamin's sack. The Vizier broke down into tears. He could not control himself any longer and so he sent the Egyptian men out of the house. Then he revealed to the Hebrews that he was in fact their brother, Joseph. He wept so loudly that even the Egyptian household heard it outside. The brothers were frozen and could not utter a word. He brought them closer and relayed to them the events that had happened and told them  not to fear, that what they had meant for evil God had meant for good. Then he commanded them to go and bring their father and his entire household into Egypt to live in the province of [[Land of Goshen|Goshen]], because there were five more years of famine left. So Joseph supplied them Egyptian transport wagons, new garments, silver money, and twenty additional donkeys carrying provisions for the journey. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|45:1-28|HE}})\n\nThus, Jacob (also known as Israel) and his entire house of seventy,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|46:27|HE}}</ref> gathered up with all their livestock and began their journey to Egypt. As they approached Egyptian territory, Judah went ahead to ask Joseph where the caravan should unload. They were directed into the province of Goshen and Joseph readied his chariot to meet his father there.<ref>Josephus has Joseph meeting his father Jacob in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], a store-city with [[Pithom]] and [[Pi-Ramesses|Raamses]], all located in the Egyptian country of Goshen. - Josephus. ''The Antiquities of the Jews''. Book II, 7.5.184</ref> It had been over twenty years since Joseph had last seen his father. When they met, they embraced each other and wept together for quite a while. His father then remarked, \u201cNow let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are still alive.\u201d ({{bibleverse||Genesis|46:1-34|HE}})\n\nAfterward, Joseph's family personally met the [[List of Pharaohs|Pharaoh]] of Egypt. The Pharaoh honored their stay and even proposed that if there were any qualified men in their house, then they may elect a chief herdsman to oversee Egyptian livestock. Because the Pharaoh had such a high regard for Joseph, practically making him his equal,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|44:18|HE}}</ref> it had been an honor to meet his father. Thus, Israel was able to bless the Pharaoh. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|47:1-47:12|HE}}) The family was then settled in Goshen.\n\n===Father\u2019s blessing and passing===\n\n{{main|Blessing of Jacob}}\n\nThe house of Israel acquired many possessions and multiplied exceedingly during the course of seventeen years, even through the worst of the seven-year famine. At this time, Joseph's father was 147 years old and bedridden. He had fallen ill and lost most of his vision. Joseph was called into his father's house and Israel pleaded with his son that he not be buried in Egypt. Rather, he requested to be carried to the land of Canaan to be buried with his forefathers. Joseph was sworn to do as his father asked of him. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|47:27-31|HE}})\n\nLater, Joseph came to visit his father having with him his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Israel declared that they would be heirs to the inheritance of the house of Israel, as if they were his own children, just as Reuben and Simeon were. Then Israel laid his left hand on the eldest Mannasseh's head and his right hand on the youngest Ephraim's head and blessed Joseph. However, Joseph was displeased that his father's right hand was not on the head of his firstborn, so he switched his father's hands. But Israel refused saying, \u201cbut truly his younger brother shall be greater than he.\u201d A declaration he made just as Israel himself was to his firstborn brother Esau. To Joseph, he gave a portion more of Canaanite property than he had to his other sons; land that he fought for against the [[Amorite]]s. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|48:1-22|HE}})\n\nThen Israel called all of his sons in and prophesied their blessings or curses to all twelve of them in order of their ages. To Joseph he declared:\n\n:\"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall. The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the Mighty God of Jacob (From thence is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel), Even by the God of your father who shall help thee; and by the Almighty who shall bless thee With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that lieth under, Blessings of the breasts and of the womb. The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills. They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.\u201d - {{bibleref2|Genesis|49:22-26|KJV|Genesis 49:22-26 KJV}}\n\nAfter relaying his prophecies, Israel died. The family, including the Egyptians, mourned him seventy days. Joseph had his father [[embalm]]ed, a process that took forty days. Then he prepared a great ceremonial journey to Canaan leading the servants of the Pharaoh, and the elders of the houses Israel and Egypt beyond the [[Jordan River]]. They stopped at [[Atad]] where they observed seven days of mourning. Here, their lamentation was so great that it caught the attention of surrounding Canaanites who remarked \u201cThis is a deep mourning of the Egyptians.\u201d So they named this spot [[Abel Mizraim]]. Then Joseph buried Israel in the cave of [[Machpelah]], the property of [[Abraham]] when he bought it from the [[biblical Hittites|Hittites]]. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|49:33-50:14|HE}})\n\nAfter their father died, the brothers of Joseph feared retribution for being responsible for Joseph's deliverance into Egypt as a slave. Joseph wept as they spoke and told them that what had happened was God's purpose to save lives and the lives of his family. He comforted them and their ties were reconciled. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|50:15-21|HE}})\n\n===Joseph's burial===\n[[File:Holman Burying the Body of Joseph.jpg|thumb|''Burying the Body of Joseph'' (illustration from the 1890 Holman Bible)]]\n\nJoseph lived to the age of 110, living to see his great-grandchildren. Before he died, he made the [[Israelites|children of Israel]] swear that when they left the land of Egypt they would take his bones with them, and on his death his body was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|50:22-26|HE}})\n\nThe [[Israelites|children of Israel]] remembered their oath, and when they left Egypt during [[the Exodus]], [[Moses]] took Joseph's bones with him. ({{bibleverse||Exodus|13:19|HE}}) The bones were buried at [[Shechem]], in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of [[Hamor]] ({{bibleverse||Joshua|24:32|HE}}), which has traditionally been identified with site of [[Joseph's Tomb]], before Jacob and all his family moved to Egypt.

The favoritism Israel showed Joseph and the plot against him by his brothers were divine means of getting him into Egypt.<ref>Scharfstein, S.

In analyzing {{bibleref2|Genesis|37|KJV|Genesis Chapter 37}}, there are five different Hebrew names used to describe five different groups of people involved in the transaction of selling Joseph, according to [[Judah ben Ilai|Rabbi Judah]] and [[Rav Huna]]. The first group identified, are Joseph's brothers when Judah brings up the idea of selling Joseph in verses 26 and 27. The first mention of Ishmaelites (Yishma'el\u00eem) is in verse 25. Then the Hebrew phrase ''\u0149\u0101sh\u00eem midyan\u00eem s\u014d\u0125r\u00eem'' in verse 28 describes Midianite traders. A fourth group in verse 36 is named in Hebrew as ''m\u2018dan\u00eem'' that is properly identified as [[Medan (son of Abraham)|Medanites]]. The final group, where a transaction is made, is among the Egyptians in the same verse.\n\nAfter identifying the Hebrew names, Rabbi Judah claims that Joseph was sold four times: First his brothers sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites (Yishma'el\u00eem), then the Ishmaelites sold him to the Midianite traders (\u0149\u0101sh\u00eem midyan\u00eem s\u014d\u0125r\u00eem), the Midianite traders to the Medanites (m\u2018dan\u00eem), and the Medanites into Egypt. [[Rav Huna]] adds one more sale by concluding that after the Medanites sold him to the Egyptians, a fifth sale occurred when the Egyptians sold him to [[Potiphar]]. ([[Genesis Rabbah]] 84:22)\n\n===Potiphar\u2019s wife===\nJoseph had good reasons not to have an affair with Potiphar's wife: he did not want to abuse his master's trust; he believed in the sanctity of marriage; and it went against his ethical, moral and religious principles taught to him by his father Jacob.  According to the [[Midrash]], Joseph would have been immediately executed by the sexual assault charge against him by Potiphar's wife. [[Abravanel]] explains that she had accused other servants of the same crime in the past.  Potiphar believed that Joseph was incapable of such an act and petitioned Pharaoh to spare his life.<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, pp. 125\u201326</ref> However, punishment could not have been avoided because of her class status and limited public knowledge of her scheme.\n\nAccording to ''[[Legend of the Jews]]'', the name of Potiphar\u2019s wife is [[Zuleikha (tradition)|Zuleikha]] and when she was enticing Joseph to give up to her sinful passion, God appeared unto him, holding the foundation of earth (''Eben Shetiyah''), that He would destroy the world If Joseph touched her.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Legends of the Jews|url= https://archive.org/details/legendsjewsfrom00cohegoog|last= Ginzberg|first= Louis|year= 1909|publisher= Jewish Publication Society|location= Philadelphia|isbn= |pages= |quote =Then the Lord appeared unto him, holding the Eben Shetiyah in His hand, and said to him: \"If thou touchest her, I will cast away this stone upon which the earth is founded, and the world will fall to ruin.\".}}</ref>\n\n===Silver cup for divination===\n[[File:Joseph Overseer of the Pharaohs Granaries.jpg|thumb|''Joseph Overseer of the Pharaoh's Granaries'', oil on canvas, by [[Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], 1874]]\nJewish tradition holds that Joseph had his steward plant his personal silver cup in Benjamin's sack to test his brothers. He wanted to know if they would be willing to risk danger in order to save their half brother Benjamin. Since Joseph and Benjamin were born from Rachel, this test was necessary to reveal if they would betray Benjamin as they did with Joseph when he was seventeen. Because ''Joseph the Dreamer'' predicts the future by analyzing dreams, alternative Jewish tradition claims that he practiced divination using this silver cup as the steward charged<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|44:15|HE}}</ref> and as Joseph himself claimed in {{bibleverse||Genesis|44:15|HE}}.<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, pp. 138\u201339</ref>\n\n===Raising Joseph===\nIn one [[Talmud]]ic story, Joseph was buried in the [[Nile river]], as there was some dispute as to which province should be honored by having his tomb within its boundaries. [[Moses]], led there by an ancient holy woman named [[Serach]], was able by a miracle to raise the [[sarcophagus]] and to take it with him at the time of [[the Exodus]].\n\n== Christian tradition ==\nJoseph is mentioned in the [[New Testament]] as an example of faith ({{bibleref2|Hebrews|11:22|9}}).\n\nJoseph is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] on 26 July. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]], he is known as \"Joseph the all-comely\", a reference not only to his physical appearance, but more importantly to the beauty of his spiritual life. They commemorate him on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (two Sundays before [[Christmas]]) and on [[Holy and Great Monday]] (Monday of [[Holy Week]]). In [[icon]]s, he is sometimes depicted wearing the [[nemes]] headdress of an [[Egyptian vizier]]. The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] commemorates him as a patriarch on 31 March.\n\n=== Typological interpretation ===\n\nIn addition to honoring him, there was a strong tendency in the [[patristics|patristic]] period to view his life as a [[Typology (theology)|typological]] precursor to Christ.<ref>{{citation|last=Smith|first=Kathryn|year=1993|title=History, Typology and Homily: The Joseph Cycle in the Queen Mary Psalter|journal=Gesta|volume=32|issue=2|pages=147\u201359|issn=0016-920X|jstor=767172|doi=10.2307/767172}}</ref> This tendency is represented in [[John Chrysostom]] who said that Joseph's suffering was \"a type of things to come\",<ref>{{citation|last=Chrysostom|first=John|authorlink=John Chrysostom|title=Homilies on Genesis, 46-47|year=1992|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|location=Washington DC|page=191|others=trans.

The cup-bearer's dream was about a vine with three branches that was budding. And as it was budding, its blossoms came out and they produced grapes. The cup-bearer took those grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand. Joseph interpreted this dream as the cup-bearer being restored as cup-bearer to the Pharaoh within three days. The baker's dream was about three baskets full of bread for the Pharaoh, and birds were eating the bread out of those baskets. Joseph interpreted this dream as the baker being hanged within three days and having his flesh eaten by birds.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|40:5-22|HE}}</ref> Joseph requested that the cup-bearer mention him to Pharaoh to secure his release from prison,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|40:14-15|HE}}</ref> but the cup-bearer, reinstalled in office, forgot Joseph.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|40:23|HE}}</ref> After two more years, the Pharaoh dreamt of seven lean cows which devoured seven fat cows; and of seven withered ears of grain which devoured seven fat ears.

''The Antiquities of the Jews'', Book II, 6.1.91</ref> to be his wife. During the seven years of abundance, Joseph ensured that the storehouses were full and that all produce was weighed. In the sixth year, Asenath bore two children to Joseph: [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]] and [[Ephraim]]. When the famine came, it was so severe that people from surrounding nations came to Egypt to buy bread. The narrative also indicates that they went straight to Joseph or were directed to him, even by the Pharaoh himself. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|41:37-57|HE}}) As a last resort, all of the inhabitants of Egypt, less the Egyptian priestly class, sold their properties and later themselves (as slaves) to Joseph for seed; wherefore Joseph set a mandate that, because the people would be sowing and harvesting seed on government property, a fifth of the produce should go to the Pharaoh.

The brothers conferred amongst themselves speaking in Hebrew, reflecting on the wrong they had done to Joseph.

Then they informed their father that the Vizier demanded that Benjamin be brought before him to demonstrate that they were honest men. Jacob became greatly distressed feeling that they treated him badly. After they had consumed all of the grain that they brought back from Egypt, Jacob told his sons to go back to Egypt for more grain.

When they were brought to Joseph's house, they were apprehensive about the returned money in their money sacks. They thought that the missed transaction would somehow be used against them as way to induct them as slaves and confiscate their possessions. So they immediately informed the steward of what had transpired to get a feel of the situation. The steward put them at ease, telling them not to worry about the money, and brought out their brother Simeon. Then he brought the brothers into the house of Joseph and received them hospitably. When the Vizier (Joseph) appeared, they gave him gifts from their father. Joseph saw and inquired of Benjamin and was overcome by emotion but did not show it. He withdrew to his chambers and wept. When he regained control of himself, he returned and ordered a meal to be served. The Egyptians would not dine with Hebrews at the same table, as doing so was considered loathsome, so the sons of Israel were served at a separate table. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|43:16-44:34|HE}})\n\nThat night, Joseph ordered his steward to load the brothers' donkeys with food and all their money. The money they brought was double what they had from the first trip. Deceptively, Joseph also ordered that his silver cup be put in Benjamin's sack. The following morning the brothers began their journey back to Canaan. Joseph ordered the steward to go after the brothers and question them about the \"missing\" silver cup. When the steward caught up with the brothers, he seized them and searched their sacks. The steward found the cup in Benjamin's sack just as he had planted it the night before. This caused a stir amongst the brothers. However, they agreed to be escorted back to Egypt. When the Vizier (Joseph) confronted them about the silver cup, he demanded that the one who possessed the cup in his bag become his slave. In response, Judah pleaded with the Vizier that Benjamin be allowed to return to his father, and he himself be kept in Benjamin's place as a slave.

The Vizier broke down into tears. He could not control himself any longer and so he sent the Egyptian men out of the house. Then he revealed to the Hebrews that he was in fact their brother, Joseph. He wept so loudly that even the Egyptian household heard it outside. The brothers were frozen and could not utter a word. He brought them closer and relayed to them the events that had happened and told them  not to fear, that what they had meant for evil God had meant for good. Then he commanded them to go and bring their father and his entire household into Egypt to live in the province of [[Land of Goshen|Goshen]], because there were five more years of famine left. So Joseph supplied them Egyptian transport wagons, new garments, silver money, and twenty additional donkeys carrying provisions for the journey. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|45:1-28|HE}})\n\nThus, Jacob (also known as Israel) and his entire house of seventy,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|46:27|HE}}</ref> gathered up with all their livestock and began their journey to Egypt. As they approached Egyptian territory, Judah went ahead to ask Joseph where the caravan should unload. They were directed into the province of Goshen and Joseph readied his chariot to meet his father there.<ref>Josephus has Joseph meeting his father Jacob in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], a store-city with [[Pithom]] and [[Pi-Ramesses|Raamses]], all located in the Egyptian country of Goshen. - Josephus.

When they met, they embraced each other and wept together for quite a while. His father then remarked, \u201cNow let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are still alive.\u201d ({{bibleverse||Genesis|46:1-34|HE}})\n\nAfterward, Joseph's family personally met the [[List of Pharaohs|Pharaoh]] of Egypt. The Pharaoh honored their stay and even proposed that if there were any qualified men in their house, then they may elect a chief herdsman to oversee Egyptian livestock. Because the Pharaoh had such a high regard for Joseph, practically making him his equal,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|44:18|HE}}</ref> it had been an honor to meet his father. Thus, Israel was able to bless the Pharaoh. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|47:1-47:12|HE}}) The family was then settled in Goshen.\n\n===Father\u2019s blessing and passing===\n\n{{main|Blessing of Jacob}}\n\nThe house of Israel acquired many possessions and multiplied exceedingly during the course of seventeen years, even through the worst of the seven-year famine. At this time, Joseph's father was 147 years old and bedridden. He had fallen ill and lost most of his vision. Joseph was called into his father's house and Israel pleaded with his son that he not be buried in Egypt. Rather, he requested to be carried to the land of Canaan to be buried with his forefathers. Joseph was sworn to do as his father asked of him. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|47:27-31|HE}})\n\nLater, Joseph came to visit his father having with him his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Israel declared that they would be heirs to the inheritance of the house of Israel, as if they were his own children, just as Reuben and Simeon were. Then Israel laid his left hand on the eldest Mannasseh's head and his right hand on the youngest Ephraim's head and blessed Joseph. However, Joseph was displeased that his father's right hand was not on the head of his firstborn, so he switched his father's hands. But Israel refused saying, \u201cbut truly his younger brother shall be greater than he.\u201d A declaration he made just as Israel himself was to his firstborn brother Esau. To Joseph, he gave a portion more of Canaanite property than he had to his other sons; land that he fought for against the [[Amorite]]s. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|48:1-22|HE}})\n\nThen Israel called all of his sons in and prophesied their blessings or curses to all twelve of them in order of their ages. To Joseph he declared:\n\n:\"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall. The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the Mighty God of Jacob (From thence is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel), Even by the God of your father who shall help thee; and by the Almighty who shall bless thee With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that lieth under, Blessings of the breasts and of the womb. The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills. They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.\u201d - {{bibleref2|Genesis|49:22-26|KJV|Genesis 49:22-26 KJV}}\n\nAfter relaying his prophecies, Israel died. The family, including the Egyptians, mourned him seventy days. Joseph had his father [[embalm]]ed, a process that took forty days. Then he prepared a great ceremonial journey to Canaan leading the servants of the Pharaoh, and the elders of the houses Israel and Egypt beyond the [[Jordan River]]. They stopped at [[Atad]] where they observed seven days of mourning. Here, their lamentation was so great that it caught the attention of surrounding Canaanites who remarked \u201cThis is a deep mourning of the Egyptians.\u201d So they named this spot [[Abel Mizraim]]. Then Joseph buried Israel in the cave of [[Machpelah]], the property of [[Abraham]] when he bought it from the [[biblical Hittites|Hittites]]. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|49:33-50:14|HE}})\n\nAfter their father died, the brothers of Joseph feared retribution for being responsible for Joseph's deliverance into Egypt as a slave. Joseph wept as they spoke and told them that what had happened was God's purpose to save lives and the lives of his family. He comforted them and their ties were reconciled.

Before he died, he made the [[Israelites|children of Israel]] swear that when they left the land of Egypt they would take his bones with them, and on his death his body was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|50:22-26|HE}})\n\nThe [[Israelites|children of Israel]] remembered their oath, and when they left Egypt during [[the Exodus]], [[Moses]] took Joseph's bones with him. ({{bibleverse||Exodus|13:19|HE}}) The bones were buried at [[Shechem]], in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of [[Hamor]] ({{bibleverse||Joshua|24:32|HE}}), which has traditionally been identified with site of [[Joseph's Tomb]], before Jacob and all his family moved to Egypt.

In analyzing {{bibleref2|Genesis|37|KJV|Genesis Chapter 37}}, there are five different Hebrew names used to describe five different groups of people involved in the transaction of selling Joseph, according to [[Judah ben Ilai|Rabbi Judah]] and [[Rav Huna]]. The first group identified, are Joseph's brothers when Judah brings up the idea of selling Joseph in verses 26 and 27. The first mention of Ishmaelites (Yishma'el\u00eem) is in verse 25. Then the Hebrew phrase ''\u0149\u0101sh\u00eem midyan\u00eem s\u014d\u0125r\u00eem'' in verse 28 describes Midianite traders. A fourth group in verse 36 is named in Hebrew as ''m\u2018dan\u00eem'' that is properly identified as [[Medan (son of Abraham)|Medanites]]. The final group, where a transaction is made, is among the Egyptians in the same verse.\n\nAfter identifying the Hebrew names, Rabbi Judah claims that Joseph was sold four times: First his brothers sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites (Yishma'el\u00eem), then the Ishmaelites sold him to the Midianite traders (\u0149\u0101sh\u00eem midyan\u00eem s\u014d\u0125r\u00eem), the Midianite traders to the Medanites (m\u2018dan\u00eem), and the Medanites into Egypt. [[Rav Huna]] adds one more sale by concluding that after the Medanites sold him to the Egyptians, a fifth sale occurred when the Egyptians sold him to [[Potiphar]]. ([[Genesis Rabbah]] 84:22)\n\n===Potiphar\u2019s wife===\nJoseph had good reasons not to have an affair with Potiphar's wife: he did not want to abuse his master's trust; he believed in the sanctity of marriage; and it went against his ethical, moral and religious principles taught to him by his father Jacob.  According to the [[Midrash]], Joseph would have been immediately executed by the sexual assault charge against him by Potiphar's wife. [[Abravanel]] explains that she had accused other servants of the same crime in the past.  Potiphar believed that Joseph was incapable of such an act and petitioned Pharaoh to spare his life.<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, pp. 125\u201326</ref> However, punishment could not have been avoided because of her class status and limited public knowledge of her scheme.\n\nAccording to ''[[Legend of the Jews]]'', the name of Potiphar\u2019s wife is [[Zuleikha (tradition)|Zuleikha]] and when she was enticing Joseph to give up to her sinful passion, God appeared unto him, holding the foundation of earth (''Eben Shetiyah''), that He would destroy the world If Joseph touched her.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Legends of the Jews|url= https://archive.org/details/legendsjewsfrom00cohegoog|last= Ginzberg|first= Louis|year= 1909|publisher= Jewish Publication Society|location= Philadelphia|isbn= |pages= |quote =Then the Lord appeared unto him, holding the Eben Shetiyah in His hand, and said to him: \"If thou touchest her, I will cast away this stone upon which the earth is founded, and the world will fall to ruin.\".}}</ref>\n\n===Silver cup for divination===\n[[File:Joseph Overseer of the Pharaohs Granaries.jpg|thumb|''Joseph Overseer of the Pharaoh's Granaries'', oil on canvas, by [[Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], 1874]]\nJewish tradition holds that Joseph had his steward plant his personal silver cup in Benjamin's sack to test his brothers. He wanted to know if they would be willing to risk danger in order to save their half brother Benjamin. Since Joseph and Benjamin were born from Rachel, this test was necessary to reveal if they would betray Benjamin as they did with Joseph when he was seventeen. Because ''Joseph the Dreamer'' predicts the future by analyzing dreams, alternative Jewish tradition claims that he practiced divination using this silver cup as the steward charged<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|44:15|HE}}</ref> and as Joseph himself claimed in {{bibleverse||Genesis|44:15|HE}}.<ref>Scharfstein, 2008, pp. 138\u201339</ref>\n\n===Raising Joseph===\nIn one [[Talmud]]ic story, Joseph was buried in the [[Nile river]], as there was some dispute as to which province should be honored by having his tomb within its boundaries. [[Moses]], led there by an ancient holy woman named [[Serach]], was able by a miracle to raise the [[sarcophagus]] and to take it with him at the time of [[the Exodus]].\n\n== Christian tradition ==\nJoseph is mentioned in the [[New Testament]] as an example of faith ({{bibleref2|Hebrews|11:22|9}}).\n\nJoseph is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] on 26 July. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]], he is known as \"Joseph the all-comely\", a reference not only to his physical appearance, but more importantly to the beauty of his spiritual life. They commemorate him on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (two Sundays before [[Christmas]]) and on [[Holy and Great Monday]] (Monday of [[Holy Week]]). In [[icon]]s, he is sometimes depicted wearing the [[nemes]] headdress of an [[Egyptian vizier]]. The [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] commemorates him as a patriarch on 31 March.\n\n=== Typological interpretation ===\n\nIn addition to honoring him, there was a strong tendency in the [[patristics|patristic]] period to view his life as a [[Typology (theology)|typological]] precursor to Christ.<ref>{{citation|last=Smith|first=Kathryn|year=1993|title=History, Typology and Homily: The Joseph Cycle in the Queen Mary Psalter|journal=Gesta|volume=32|issue=2|pages=147\u201359|issn=0016-920X|jstor=767172|doi=10.2307/767172}}</ref> This tendency is represented in [[John Chrysostom]] who said that Joseph's suffering was \"a type of things to come\",<ref>{{citation|last=Chrysostom|first=John|authorlink=John Chrysostom|title=Homilies on Genesis, 46-47|year=1992|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|location=Washington DC|page=191|others=trans.

It was disbanded in 2002 due to financial difficulties. In 2016 FC Marisan Ruse renamed to Lokomotiv, although the team has no legal link with the previous team named Lokomotiv.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nLokomotiv (Ruse) is one of the first railwaymen sport clubs in Bulgaria. It was formed in 1928-1929 from railwaymen workers at Locomotive and Wagon factory in Ruse. Lokomomotiv (Ruse) was registered and licensed by The Bulgarian National Sport Federation at 4 December 1930 as ZhSK ''(Zheleznicharski sporten klub, in [[English language|English]]: Railways Sports Club, in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] \u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043d \u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431)''. ZhSK (Ruse) joined Ruse Regional Championship in 1931. In Second World War period ZhSK reached its first major success. Railway team won Ruse Regional Championship five times (1942, 1943, 1946, 1947, 1948). In those years ZhSK (Ruse) recorded their participation at the highest level of Bulgarian football - State Championship. The best ranking was in the 1943 - quarterfinal.\n\n=== At Communist Era ===\nIn 1945 the name was changed from ZhSK to Lokomotiv after the reorganization of the Bulgarian sport movement at the beginning of the Communist era. During the period 1946-1948 Lokomotiv (Ruse) was the best team in Ruse and in 1946 reached another remarkable success - semi-final in National Cup (then Cup of the Soviet Army). In 1948-1949 there was another reorganization of the Bulgarian sport movement. Many of the city clubs were merged into only one team - in Ruse Lokomotiv was merged along with Dinamo (founded in 1944) and Rusenets (founded in 1947) into City Society for Physical Culture and Sport \"Dunav\" at 16 February 1949. The tradition was continued in the new Ruse Railways sports team for the next three years. In 1952 a new total reorganization of the National Sport Movement in Bulgaria was made. As the USSR's Voluntary Sports organizations, in Bulgaria have been created many DSO (Voluntary Sports organizations). One of that was DSO Lokomotiv (Ruse). Railwaymen team restarted in Bulgarian football Championship from the lowest level and just for a year gained a promotion to \"B\" group (second level in Bulgarian football pyramid). When at the end of the 1950s the new reorganization of Bulgarian sport was made, in Ruse there were only two football teams - Dunav and Lokomotiv. The local bureau of the Communist party decided to give Dunav the role of a first team of the city and Lokomotiv was considered to be the second best team in Ruse for many years ahead. The team played for 20 times at second level (\"B\" group) and several times was relegated into \"V\" group (third level). Lokomotiv was notable for its very good youth setup. This was due to the fact that many young prospect from the football academy of Lokomotiv played along with some veterans in the first team. In 1980s Lokomotiv (Ruse) had several successes in the two major cup tournaments in Bulgaria - Cup of Bulgaria and Cup of the Soviet Army.\n\n=== Post Communist times  ===\nPolitical changes in Bulgaria after 1989 happened when Lokomotiv (Ruse) played in Northeast \"V\" group (third tier). In 1991/92 season the team reached promotion to \"B\" football group (second level). The financial crisis and the withdrawal of local management of Bulgarian Railway Company away from the club brought to the Locomotive Stadium new people in charge. The president of Ruse Shipyard Company Penko Dimitrov was elected as the new club chairman. It was a big shock for all the fans of Lokomotiv at the beginning of the 1992/93 season in the \"B\" group. Just several hours before the start of the season the club was renamed as \"Korabostroitel\" (Shipbuilder) and the traditional red-black colours were replaced by unacceptable white-blue just like city rivals of FC Dunav. The fans continue called the team \"Loko\" and supported the team. \"Korabostroitel\" played very good with attractive attacking style. This was no doubt due to the philosophy of the coaches - [[Nikola Hristov]] for the first part of the season and [[Asparuh Nikodimov]] for the rest of the season. Season 1994/95 in \"B\" group was more than remarkable - the team finished at 5th position. According to many experts \"Korabostroitel\" was the best team in the North \"B\" group. The team recorded impressive home wins (for example 6:0 against [[Cherno more Varna]]), and played very successful as a guest too. The striker [[Ivo Georgiev]] was an unrelenting \"goal-machine\" and became a top scorer with 26 goals in 30 games. The Shipbuilders team had the best attack in the group - 67 goals. Despite all the chance to promotion to the \"A\" group (top level) was omitted. Several rounds before the end of the season a cruel discovery was made. There were missing 15 000 000 BGN of Rousse Shipyard. The company was declared bankrupt and president Penko Dimitrov was arrested, so the team had to finish the season with no finance whatsoever. The \"Korabostroitel\" era at Locomotive Stadium finished with 5th place at the end of the season in \"B\" group. The coach and some of the star players left at the summer break.\n\n=== Last Years  ===\nThe summer of 1995 was again time for changes. After the \"Korabostroitel\" era the new aim for the club not to be relegated and if possible - to play attractively in 'B' group. The name 'Locomotiv' was again restored, and the traditional colours of the team - red and black were restored, too. The new elected chairman of FC Lokomotiv (Ruse) was Orlin Tanov - businessman of dubious reputation, like most football bosses in Bulgaria. 1995/96 season was very successful for the railways team. Two managers - [[Remzi Nuriev]] and the famous former goalkeeper [[Georgi Velinov]], who later took the charge at Lokomotiv (Ruse) not only saved the team from relegation, but also made it more impressive with victories at home over all strong teams in the league, including the new champion of 'B' group Maritsa (Plovdiv). The sweetest victory was over the city rivals Dunav (Ruse) - historical 1:0 in a real thriller. The referee tried to help Dunav and awarded a penalty kick and showed three (3) red cards to Lokomotiv players. Ultimately derby ended in victory for the railways team inspired by a late goal from a big distance in 86 minutes. The scorer was Viktor Nankov.\nNext season (1996/97) was the last for the team in \"B\" division and the team was relegated to \"V\" group (third tier). The next 5 years the team battled hard to survive in \"V\" group. All the players in the first three years have been youngsters from the academy of the team. The last two years of that period the experienced [[Blagovest Georgiev]], [[Miroslav Enev]], Samir Mastanov, Tzanko Serafimov and other former Lokomotiv players return to the club. In 2000/01 Lokomotiv finished 2nd. At the summer break it became clear that the team had fallen into serious financial crisis. In order to survive, Lokomotiv unified with another third-tier team from Ruse - \"Chicago\". With that for the new 2001/02 season the name of the club is changed into \"Lokomotiv - Chicago\". But this step did not save the team from financial troubles as the team still had a lot of debts. Despite the fact, that year the team became champions of \"V\" group and won promotion for \"B\" group.\n\nOn 5 July 2002 the owners of the club declared that the team had no money to start the season so that it could not afford to play in \"B\" group. Both presidents - Orlin Tanov and Ventsislav Angelov started negotiations with local businessmen but in vain. On 29 July 2002 Orlin Tanov declared, that he was abolishing the team. All the contracts with players and coaches were terminated. Soon after that (in 2004) the club base was given to a new club from Ruse - [[FC Ariston]]. This team renovated the base and started to play at \"Lokomotiv\" stadium. In 2012 Ariston declared plans to build a new stadium at the place of the former \"Lokomotiv\" stadium.\n\n===2016\u2013present: Refounding===\nIn the beginning of August 2016, Marisan Ruse merged with FA Ruse under the name Lokomotiv Ruse with the idea to restore the club. The club joined the newly reformed [[Third Amateur Football League (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian Third League]].<ref>[https://utroruse.com/article/719299/

[[Bulgaria]]n [[football (soccer)|football]] club founded in 1930. It was disbanded in 2002 due to financial difficulties. In 2016 FC Marisan Ruse renamed to Lokomotiv, although the team has no legal link with the previous team named Lokomotiv.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nLokomotiv (Ruse) is one of the first railwaymen sport clubs in Bulgaria. It was formed in 1928-1929 from railwaymen workers at Locomotive and Wagon factory in Ruse. Lokomomotiv (Ruse) was registered and licensed by The Bulgarian National Sport Federation at 4 December 1930 as ZhSK ''(Zheleznicharski sporten klub, in [[English language|English]]: Railways Sports Club, in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] \u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043d \u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431)''. ZhSK (Ruse) joined Ruse Regional Championship in 1931. In Second World War period ZhSK reached its first major success. Railway team won Ruse Regional Championship five times (1942, 1943, 1946, 1947, 1948). In those years ZhSK (Ruse) recorded their participation at the highest level of Bulgarian football - State Championship. The best ranking was in the 1943 - quarterfinal.\n\n=== At Communist Era ===\nIn 1945 the name was changed from ZhSK to Lokomotiv after the reorganizasion of the Bulgarian sport movement at the beginning of the Communist era. During the period 1946-1948 Lokomotiv (Ruse) was the best team in Ruse and in 1946 reached another remarkable success - semi-final in National Cup (then Cup of the Soviet Army). In 1948-1949 there was another reorganization of the Bulgarian sport movement. Many of the city clubs were merged into only one team - in Ruse Lokomotiv was merged along with Dinamo (founded in 1944) and Rusenets (founded in 1947) into City Society for Physical Culture and Sport \"Dunav\" at 16 February 1949. The tradition was continued in the new Ruse Railways sports team for the next three years. In 1952 a new total reorganization of the National Sport Movement in Bulgaria was made. As the USSR's Voluntary Sports organizations, in Bulgaria have been created many DSO (Voluntary Sports organizations). One of that was DSO Lokomotiv (Ruse). Railwaymen team restarted in Bulgarian football Championship from the lowest level and just for a year gained a promotion to \"B\" group (second level in Bulgarian football pyramid). When at the end of the 1950s the new reorganization of Bulgarian sport was made, in Ruse there were only two football teams - Dunav and Lokomotiv. The local bureau of the Communist party decided to give Dunav the role of a first team of the city and Lokomotiv was considered to be the second best team in Ruse for many years ahead. The team played for 20 times at second level (\"B\" group) and several times was relegated into \"V\" group (third level). Lokomotiv was notable for its very good youth setup. This was due to the fact that many young prospect from the football academy of Lokomotiv played along with some veterans in the first team. In 1980s Lokomotiv (Ruse) had several successes in the two major cup tournaments in Bulgaria - Cup of Bulgaria and Cup of the Soviet Army.\n\n=== Post Communist times  ===\nPolitical changes in Bulgaria after 1989 happened when Lokomotiv (Ruse) played in Northeast \"V\" group (third tier). In 1991/92 season the team reached promotion to \"B\" football group (second level). The financial crisis and the withdrawal of local management of Bulgarian Railway Company away from the club brought to the Locomotive Stadium new people in charge. The president of Ruse Shipyard Company Penko Dimitrov was elected as the new club chairman. It was a big shock for all the fans of Lokomotiv at the beginning of the 1992/93 season in the \"B\" group. Just several hours before the start of the season the club was renamed as \"Korabostroitel\" (Shipbuilder) and the traditional red-black colors were replaced by unacceptable white-blue just like city rivals of FC Dunav. The fans continue called the team \"Loko\" and supported the team. \"Korabostroitel\" played very good with attractive attacking style. This was no doubt due to the philosophy of the coaches - [[Nikola Hristov]] for the first part of the season and [[Asparuh Nikodimov]] for the rest of the season. Season 1994/95 in \"B\" group was more than remarkable - the team finished at 5th position. According to many experts \"Korabostroitel\" was the best team in the North \"B\" group. The team recorded impressive home wins (for example 6:0 against [[Cherno more Varna]]), and played very successful as a guest too. The striker [[Ivo Georgiev]] was an unrelenting \"goal-machine\" and became a top scorer with 26 goals in 30 games. The Shipbuilders team had the best attack in the group - 67 goals. Despite all the chance to promotion to the \"A\" group (top level) was omitted. Several rounds before the end of the season a cruel discovery was made. There were missing 15 000 000 BGN of Rousse Shipyard. The company was declared bankrupt and president Penko Dimitrov was arrested, so the team had to finish the season with no finance whatsoever. The \"Korabostroitel\" era at Locomotive Stadium finished with 5th place at the end of the season in \"B\" group. The coach and some of the star players left at the summer break.\n\n=== Last Years  ===\nThe summer of 1995 was again time for changes. After the \"Korabostroitel\" era the new aim for the club not to be relegated and if possible - to play attractively in 'B' group. The name 'Locomotiv' was again restored, and the traditional colors of the team - red and black were restored, too. The new elected chairman of FC Lokomotiv (Ruse) was Orlin Tanov - businessman of dubious reputation, like most football bosses in Bulgaria. 1995/96 season was very successful for the railways team. Two managers - [[Remzi Nuriev]] and the famous former goalkeeper [[Georgi Velinov]], who later took the charge at Lokomotiv (Ruse) not only saved the team from relegation, but also made it more impressive with victories at home over all strong teams in the league, including the new champion of 'B' group Maritsa (Plovdiv). The sweetest victory was over the city rivals Dunav (Ruse) - historical 1:0 in a real thriller. The referee tried to help Dunav and awarded a penalty kick and showed three (3) red cards to Lokomotiv players. Ultimately derby ended in victory for the railways team inspired by a late goal from a big distance in 86 minutes. The scorer was Viktor Nankov.\nNext season (1996/97) was the last for the team in \"B\" division and the team was relegated to \"V\" group (third tier). The next 5 years the team battled hard to survive in \"V\" group. All the players in the first three years have been youngsters from the academy of the team. The last two years of that period the experienced [[Blagovest Georgiev]], [[Miroslav Enev]], Samir Mastanov, Tzanko Serafimov and other former Lokomotiv players return to the club. In 2000/01 Lokomotiv finished 2nd. At the summer break it became clear that the team had fallen into serious financial crisis. In order to survive, Lokomotiv unified with another third-tier team from Ruse - \"Chicago\". With that for the new 2001/02 season the name of the club is changed into \"Lokomotiv - Chicago\". But this step did not save the team from financial troubles as the team still had a lot of debts. Despite the fact, that year the team became champions of \"V\" group and won promotion for \"B\" group.\n\nOn 5 July 2002 the owners of the club declared that the team had no money to start the season so that it could not afford to play in \"B\" group. Both presidents - Orlin Tanov and Ventsislav Angelov started negotiations with local businessmen but in vain. On 29 July 2002 Orlin Tanov declared, that he was abolishing the team. All the contracts with players and coaches were terminated. Soon after that (in 2004) the club base was given to a new club from Ruse - [[FC Ariston]]. This team renovated the base and started to play at \"Lokomotiv\" stadium. In 2012 Ariston declared plans to build a new stadium at the place of the former \"Lokomotiv\" stadium.\n\n===2016\u2013present: Refounding===\nIn the beginning of August 2016, Marisan Ruse merged with FA Ruse under the name Lokomotiv Ruse with the idea to restore the club. The club joined the newly reformed [[Third Amateur Football League (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian Third League]].<ref>[https://utroruse.com/article/719299/

Microbicides can be formulated in various [[Drug delivery|delivery systems]] including [[gel]]s, [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lotion]]s, [[aerosol spray]]s, [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] or [[coating|films]] (which must be used near the time of [[sexual intercourse]]) and sponges and [[vaginal ring]]s (or other devices that release the [[active ingredient]](s) over a longer period). Some of these agents are being developed for [[vagina]]l application, and for [[Rectum|rectal]] use by those engaging in [[anal sex]].\n\nAlthough there are many approaches to preventing sexually transmitted diseases in general (and HIV in particular), current methods have not been sufficient to halt the spread of these diseases (particularly among women and people in [[Developing country|less-developed nations]]). [[Sexual abstinence]] is not a realistic option for women who want to bear children, or who are at risk of [[sexual violence]].<ref>{{Cite web\n| last = gender\n| title = Research: hiv aids\n| url=http://www.who.int/gender/hiv_aids/en/index.html\n| accessdate = 1 April 2018\n}}</ref> In such situations, the use of microbicides could offer both primary protection (in the absence of [[condom]]s) and secondary protection (if a condom breaks or slips off during intercourse). It is hoped that microbicides may be safe and effective in reducing the risk of HIV [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with an infected partner.<ref>{{Cite web\n| last = global-campaign\n| title = Research: microbicides\n| url=http://www.global-campaign.org/about_microbicides.htm\n| accessdate = 1 April 2018\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| last = rectalmicrobicide\n| title = Research: rectalmicrobicides\n| url=http://www.rectalmicrobicides.org/\n| accessdate = 1 April 2018\n}}</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Mechanisms of action==\n\n=== Detergents ===\n[[Detergent]] and [[surfactant]] microbicides such as [[nonoxynol-9]], [[Sodium lauryl sulfate|sodium dodecyl sulfate]] and Savvy (1.0% C31G), act by disrupting the [[viral envelope]], [[capsid]] or [[Lipid bilayer|lipid membrane]] of microorganisms. Since detergent microbicides also kill host cells and impair the barrier function of healthy [[Mucous membrane|mucosal]] surfaces, they are less desirable than other agents.

However, vaginal rings have the potential to provide long-term controlled release of microbicide drugs. Long-acting formulations, like vaginal rings, are potentially advantageous since they could be easy to use, requiring replacement only once a month. This ease of use could prove very important to make sure that products are used properly. In 2010, the [[International Partnership for Microbicides]] began the first study in Africa to test the safety and acceptability of a vaginal ring containing dapivirine.<ref>{{Cite web\n |last         = control to fight AIDS\n |title        = Research:New vaginal ring borrows from birth control to fight AIDS\n |url          = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iZIqphwxvTmJxxhCRibhNPEtsL2Q\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611063830/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iZIqphwxvTmJxxhCRibhNPEtsL2Q\n |archive-date = 2010-06-11\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> Drugs might also be administered systemically through injectable or oral formulations known as PrEP.

The trial, [[CAPRISA 004]], was conducted among 889 women to evaluate the ability of 1% tenofovir gel to prevent male-to-female HIV transmission. The study found a 39% lower HIV infection rate in women using 1% tenofovir gel compared with women using a placebo gel. In addition, tenofovir gel was shown to be safe as tested.<ref name=\"caprisa\" /> The results of the [[CAPRISA 004]] trial provide statistically significant evidence that ARVs, topically applied to the vaginal mucosa, can offer protection against HIV and (potentially) other pathogens. During the study, 38 of the women who used the tenofovir gel acquired HIV and 60 women who used a placebo gel became HIV-infected. No tenofovir-resistant virus was detected in the women who acquired HIV infection during the study. In addition to demonstrating efficacy against HIV, CAPRISA 004 found evidence that tenofovir gel also prevents the transmission of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-2 is a lifelong, incurable infection which can make those infected with the virus two-to-three times more likely to acquire HIV. Data collected during the CAPRISA 004 study indicate that tenofovir gel provided 51% protection against HSV-2. Tenofovir, developed by Gilead Sciences, is a nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) which interferes with the replication of HIV and is approved in tablet form for use in combination with other ARVs to treat HIV.

Microbicides can be formulated in various [[Drug delivery|delivery systems]] including [[gel]]s, [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lotion]]s, [[aerosol spray]]s, [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] or [[coating|films]] (which must be used near the time of [[sexual intercourse]]) and sponges and [[vaginal ring]]s (or other devices that release the [[active ingredient]](s) over a longer period). Some of these agents are being developed for [[vagina]]l application, and for [[Rectum|rectal]] use by those engaging in [[anal sex]].\n\nAlthough there are many approaches to preventing sexually transmitted diseases in general (and HIV in particular), current methods have not been sufficient to halt the spread of these diseases (particularly among women and people in [[Developing country|less-developed nations]]).

Long-acting formulations, like vaginal rings, are potentially advantageous since they could be easy to use, requiring replacement only once a month.

The trial, [[CAPRISA 004]], was conducted among 889 women to evaluate the ability of 1% tenofovir gel to prevent male-to-female HIV transmission. The study found a 39% lower HIV infection rate in women using 1% tenofovir gel compared with women using a placebo gel. In addition, tenofovir gel was shown to be safe as tested.<ref name=\"caprisa\" /> The results of the [[CAPRISA 004]] trial provide statistically significant evidence that ARVs, topically applied to the vaginal mucosa, can offer protection against HIV and (potentially) other pathogens. During the study, 38 of the women who used the tenofovir gel acquired HIV and 60 women who used a placebo gel became HIV-infected. No tenofovir-resistant virus was detected in the women who acquired HIV infection during the study. In addition to demonstrating efficacy against HIV, CAPRISA 004 found evidence that tenofovir gel also prevents the transmission of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-2 is a lifelong, incurable infection which can make those infected with the virus two-to-three times more likely to acquire HIV. Data collected during the CAPRISA 004 study indicate that tenofovir gel provided 51% protection against HSV-2. Tenofovir, developed by Gilead Sciences, is a nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) which interferes with the replication of HIV and is approved in tablet form for use in combination with other ARVs to treat HIV. CAPRISA 004 was a collaboration among CAPRISA, [[Family Health International]] and [[CONRAD (organization)|CONRAD]].

Charity shops are a type of [[social enterprise]]. They sell mainly [[used good]]s such as clothing, books, music albums, [[DVD]]s, toys and furniture [[donation|donated]] by members of the public, and are often staffed by [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s. Because the items for sale were obtained for free, and business [[cost]]s are low, the items can be sold at competitive [[price]]s.  After costs are paid, all remaining [[income]] from the sales is used in accord with the organization's stated charitable purpose. Costs include purchase and/or [[depreciation]] of fixtures (clothing racks, bookshelves, counters, etc.), operating costs (maintenance, municipal service fees, electricity, heat, telephone, limited advertising) and the building [[lease]] or [[mortgage]].\n\nSome charity shops also offer for sale a limited amount of edibles such as soda drinks, water, ice cream, snacks and candy. When available, these items are usually near the stores' cashiers.\n\n==Terminology==\nCharity shops may also be referred to as '''thrift stores''' (in the United States and Canada), '''hospice shops''', '''resale shops''' (a term that in the United States also covers [[consignment#second-hand shop|consignment shops]]), and '''opportunity''' (or '''op''') '''shops''' (in Australia and New Zealand).\n\n==History==\n[[File:First Oxfam shop plaque crop.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque attached to the original Oxfam shop at 17 [[Broad Street, Oxford]]]]\nOne of the earliest known charity shops in the United Kingdom was set up by the Wolverhampton Society for the Blind (now called the [[Beacon Centre for the Blind]]) in 1899 to sell goods made by blind people to raise money for the Society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourherald.com/news/2013-10-03/Opinion/Thrift_Store_or_Treasure_TroveYou_Decide.html|title=Thrift Store or Treasure Trove\u2013You Decide|access-date=23 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821004315/http://www.ourherald.com/news/2013-10-03/Opinion/Thrift_Store_or_Treasure_TroveYou_Decide.html|archive-date=21 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> During [[World War I]], various fund-raising activities occurred, such as a [[Charity Bazaar|charity bazaar]] in [[Shepherd Market]], London, which made \u00a350,000 for the [[Red Cross]].\n\nHowever, it was during the [[Second World War]] that the charity shop became widespread. [[Edinburgh University Settlement]] opened their 'Thrift Shop for Everyone' on Nicholson Place, [[Edinburgh]] in 1937, the [[Red Cross]] opened up its first charity shop at 17 [[Old Bond Street]], [[London]] in 1941. For the duration of the war, over two hundred \u201cpermanent\u201d Red Cross gift shops and about 150 temporary Red Cross shops were opened. A condition of the shop licence issued by the [[Board of Trade]] was that all goods offered for sale were gifts. Purchase for re-sale was forbidden. The entire proceeds from sales had to be passed to the Duke of Gloucester\u2019s Red Cross or the [[St John's Ambulance|St John Fund]]. Most premises were lent free of [[renting|rent]] and in some cases owners also met the costs of heating and lighting.\n\nThe first [[Oxfam]] charity shop in the United Kingdom was established by [[Cecil Jackson-Cole]] in Broad Street, [[Oxford]], and began trading in December 1947 (although the shop itself did not open until February 1948).\n\n\"Thrifting\" or shopping in thrift stores have become more popular with people looking for antiques and cool finds. Some people are even filming themselves find expensive items and buy them for cheaper. These videos are become more popular getting millions of views. Also, you may find videos on fixing/changing the article of clothing or furniture. This is a more sustainable and better way for the environment.\n\n==Popularity==\n[[File:Suncoast Humane Society Thrift Shop Truck.jpg|thumb|right|Truck used by the Suncoast Humane Society Thrift Store to collect donations in [[Port Charlotte, Florida]].]]\nCharity shops are often popular with people who are [[Frugality|frugal]]. In [[the United States]], shopping at a charity store has become popular enough to earn a name: ''thrifting''. [[Environmentalist]]s may prefer buying [[used good|second-hand good]]s as this uses fewer [[natural resource]]s and would usually do less damage to the [[ecology|environment]] than by buying new goods would, in part because the goods are usually collected locally.  In addition, reusing second-hand items is a form of [[recycling]], and thus reduces the amount of [[waste]] going to [[landfill]] sites. People who oppose [[sweat shops|sweatshops]] often purchase [[The global trade of secondhand clothing|second-hand clothing]] as an alternative to supporting clothing companies with dubious [[ethical]] practices.  People who desire authentic [[vintage clothing]] typically shop at thrift stores since most clothing that is donated is old and out of normal fashion, or is from a recently deceased person who had not updated his clothing for a long time. Many [[YouTube]] channels make thrifting videos showcasing fashionable and unusual finds.\n\nSecond-hand goods are considered to be quite safe. The [[South Australia]]n Public Health Directorate says that the health risk of buying used clothing is very low. It explains that washing purchased items in hot water is just one of several ways to eliminate the risk of contracting infectious diseases.<ref name=\"sa_health\">{{cite web|title=Second-hand goods: A guide for consumers|url=http://www.health.sa.gov.au/pehs/PDF-files/ph-fs-consumers-secondhand.pdf|website=Public and Environmental Health Service website|publisher=Department of Health, Government of South Australia|accessdate=16 July 2010|format=PDF|date=October 2008|quote=As the risk to health associated with second-hand goods is very low, thorough and hygienic cleaning is all that is required to eliminate the risk of contracting infectious diseases. ...

[[Oxfam]] stores, for example, sell [[fair trade]] food and crafts. Charity shops may receive [[overstock]] or obsolete goods from local for-profit businesses; the for-profit businesses benefit by taking a tax write-off and [[closeout (sale)|clearing unwanted goods]] from their store instead of throwing the goods out, which is costly.\n\n==Charity shops by region==\n===Australia===\nIn Australia, major national opportunity shop chains include the [[St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store]] ([[trading as]] Vinnies) which operate 627 shops across Australia,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vinnies.org.au/page/About/FAQs/How_many_Vinnies_shops_are_there/ | title = How many Vinnies shops are there? | accessdate = 2 October 2016}}</ref> Anglicare Shops, that currently operate in 19 locations across Sydney and the Illawarra also various locations around Australia, the [[Salvation Army]] (trading as Salvos), the [[Red Cross]], MS Australia, and the [[Brotherhood of St. Laurence]].

Charity shops are a type of [[social enterprise]]. They sell mainly [[used good]]s such as clothing, books, music albums, [[DVD]]s, toys and furniture [[donation|donated]] by members of the public, and are often staffed by [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s. Because the items for sale were obtained for free, and business [[cost]]s are low, the items can be sold at competitive [[price]]s.  After costs are paid, all remaining [[income]] from the sales is used in accord with the organization's stated charitable purpose. Costs include purchase and/or [[depreciation]] of fixtures (clothing racks, bookshelves, counters, etc.), operating costs (maintenance, municipal service fees, electricity, heat, telephone, limited advertising) and the building [[lease]] or [[mortgage]].\n\nSome charity shops also offer for sale a limited amount of edibles such as soda drinks, water, ice cream, snacks and candy. When available, these items are usually near the stores' cashiers.\n\n==Terminology==\nCharity shops may also be referred to as '''thrift stores''' (in the United States and Canada), '''hospice shops''', '''resale shops''' (a term that in the United States also covers [[consignment#second-hand shop|consignment shops]]), and '''opportunity''' (or '''op''') '''shops''' (in Australia and New Zealand).\n\n==History==\n[[File:First Oxfam shop plaque crop.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque attached to the original Oxfam shop at 17 [[Broad Street, Oxford]]]]\nOne of the earliest known charity shops in the United Kingdom was set up by the Wolverhampton Society for the Blind (now called the [[Beacon Centre for the Blind]]) in 1899 to sell goods made by blind people to raise money for the Society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourherald.com/news/2013-10-03/Opinion/Thrift_Store_or_Treasure_TroveYou_Decide.html|title=Thrift Store or Treasure Trove\u2013You Decide|access-date=23 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821004315/http://www.ourherald.com/news/2013-10-03/Opinion/Thrift_Store_or_Treasure_TroveYou_Decide.html|archive-date=21 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> During [[World War I]], various fund-raising activities occurred, such as a [[Charity Bazaar|charity bazaar]] in [[Shepherd Market]], London, which made \u00a350,000 for the [[Red Cross]].\n\nHowever, it was during the [[Second World War]] that the charity shop became widespread. [[Edinburgh University Settlement]] opened their 'Thrift Shop for Everyone' on Nicholson Place, [[Edinburgh]] in 1937, the [[Red Cross]] opened up its first charity shop at 17 [[Old Bond Street]], [[London]] in 1941. For the duration of the war, over two hundred \u201cpermanent\u201d Red Cross gift shops and about 150 temporary Red Cross shops were opened. A condition of the shop licence issued by the [[Board of Trade]] was that all goods offered for sale were gifts. Purchase for re-sale was forbidden. The entire proceeds from sales had to be passed to the Duke of Gloucester\u2019s Red Cross or the [[St John's Ambulance|St John Fund]]. Most premises were lent free of [[renting|rent]] and in some cases owners also met the costs of heating and lighting.\n\nThe first [[Oxfam]] charity shop in the United Kingdom was established by [[Cecil Jackson-Cole]] in Broad Street, [[Oxford]], and began trading in December 1947 (although the shop itself did not open until February 1948).\n\n==Popularity==\n[[File:Suncoast Humane Society Thrift Shop Truck.jpg|thumb|right|Truck used by the Suncoast Humane Society Thrift Store to collect donations in [[Port Charlotte, Florida]].]]\nCharity shops are often popular with people who are [[Frugality|frugal]]. In [[the United States]], shopping at a charity store has become popular enough to earn a name: ''thrifting''. [[Environmentalist]]s may prefer buying [[used good|second-hand good]]s as this uses fewer [[natural resource]]s and would usually do less damage to the [[ecology|environment]] than by buying new goods would, in part because the goods are usually collected locally.  In addition, reusing second-hand items is a form of [[recycling]], and thus reduces the amount of [[waste]] going to [[landfill]] sites. People who oppose [[sweat shops|sweatshops]] often purchase [[The global trade of secondhand clothing|second-hand clothing]] as an alternative to supporting clothing companies with dubious [[ethical]] practices.  People who desire authentic [[vintage clothing]] typically shop at thrift stores since most clothing that is donated is old and out of normal fashion, or is from a recently deceased person who had not updated his clothing for a long time. Many [[YouTube]] channels make thrifting videos showcasing fashionable and unusual finds.\n\nSecond-hand goods are considered to be quite safe. The [[South Australia]]n Public Health Directorate says that the health risk of buying used clothing is very low. It explains that washing purchased items in hot water is just one of several ways to eliminate the risk of contracting infectious diseases.<ref name=\"sa_health\">{{cite web|title=Second-hand goods: A guide for consumers|url=http://www.health.sa.gov.au/pehs/PDF-files/ph-fs-consumers-secondhand.pdf|website=Public and Environmental Health Service website|publisher=Department of Health, Government of South Australia|accessdate=16 July 2010|format=PDF|date=October 2008|quote=As the risk to health associated with second-hand goods is very low, thorough and hygienic cleaning is all that is required to eliminate the risk of contracting infectious diseases. ...

[[Oxfam]] stores, for example, sell [[fair trade]] food and crafts. Charity shops may receive [[overstock]] or obsolete goods from local for-profit businesses; the for-profit businesses benefit by taking a tax write-off and [[closeout (sale)|clearing unwanted goods]] from their store instead of throwing the goods out, which is costly.\n\n==Charity shops by region==\n===Australia===\nIn Australia, major national opportunity shop chains include the [[St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store]] ([[trading as]] Vinnies) which operate 627 shops across Australia,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vinnies.org.au/page/About/FAQs/How_many_Vinnies_shops_are_there/ | title = How many Vinnies shops are there? | accessdate = 2 October 2016}}</ref> Anglicare Shops, that currently operate in 19 locations across Sydney and the Illawarra also various locations around Australia, the [[Salvation Army]] (trading as Salvos), the [[Red Cross]], MS Australia, and the [[Brotherhood of St. Laurence]]. Many local charitable organisations, both religious and secular, run opportunity shops.  Common among these are missions and [[animal shelter]]s.\n===United Kingdom===\n[[Image:Charity-shop-Epping-029.JPG|thumb|right|Window display in a UK charity shop.]]\nOxfam has the largest number of charity shops in the UK with over 700 shops. Many Oxfam shops also sell books, and the organization now operates over 70 specialist [[Oxfam Bookshop]]s, making them the largest retailer of second-hand books in the United Kingdom. Other Oxfam affiliates also have shops, such as [[Jersey]], Germany, [[Ireland]] (45 shops in NI/ROI), the [[Netherlands]] and [[Hong Kong]]. Other charities with a strong presence on high streets in the UK include [[The Children's Society]], [[YMCA]], [[British Heart Foundation]], [[Barnardos]], [[Cancer Research UK]], [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]], [[Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation]], [[Age UK]] (formerly [[Age Concern]] and [[Help the Aged]]), [[Marie Curie Cancer Care]], [[Norwood (charity)|Norwood]], [[Save the Children]], [[Scope (British charity)|Scope]], [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals|PDSA]], [[Naomi House Children's Hospice]] and [[Sue Ryder Care]]. Many local [[Hospice care|hospice]]s also operate charity shops to raise funds.\n\nThere are over 9,000 charity shops in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Their locations can be found on the Charity Retail Association (CRA) website,<ref>[http://www.charityretail.org.uk/locator.php Charity Retail Association FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206043526/http://www.charityretail.org.uk/locator.php |date=6 December 2010 }}</ref> along with information on charity retail, what shops can and can't accept, etc. The CRA is a member organisation for charities which run shops. British charity shops are mainly staffed by unpaid volunteers, with a paid shop manager. Goods for sale are predominantly from donations - 87% according to the official estimate.<ref>[http://www.charityretail.org.uk/faqs_shop.html Charity Retail Association FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206043520/http://www.charityretail.org.uk/faqs_shop.html |date=6 December 2010 }}</ref> Donations should be taken directly to a charity shop during opening hours, as goods left on the street may be stolen or damaged by passers-by or inclement weather. In expensive areas, donations include a proportion of good quality designer clothing and charity shops in these areas are sought out for cut-price fashions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} 'Standard' charity shops sell a mix of clothing, books, toys, videos, DVDs, music (like CDs, cassette tapes and vinyl) and [[Bric-\u00e0-brac|bric-a-brac]] (like cutlery and ornaments). Some shops specialise in certain areas, like vintage clothing, furniture, electrical items, or records.\n\nAlmost all charity shops sell on their unsold textiles (i.e. unfashionable, stained or damaged fabric) to textile processors. Each charity shop saves an average of 40 tonnes of textiles every year, by selling them in the shop, or passing them on to these textile merchants for recycling or reuse. This grosses to around 363,000 tonnes across all charity shops in the UK; based on 2010 landfill tax value at \u00a348 per tonne, the value of textiles reused or passed for recycling by charity shops in terms of savings in landfill tax is \u00a317,424,000 p.a.<ref>[http://www.charityretail.org.uk/reuse.html Charity Retail Association Reuse FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206034042/http://www.charityretail.org.uk/reuse.html |date=6 December 2010 }}</ref> [[Gift Aid]] is a UK tax incentive for individual donors where, subject to a signed declaration being held by the charity, income tax paid on donations can be reclaimed by the charity.
