As mentioned his tenure as a Da'i ul-Mutlaq was very short but he played a pivotal role as one of the most trusted person from Hudood and as a Mazoon during the period of 23rd and 24th Da'i.\n\nFollowing the death of the 26th Da'i Dawoodji Burhaanuddin bin Saiyedi Ajabshah in 997 AH/1591 AD in Ahmedabad, there was a dispute as to who was to succeed him. [[Suleman bin Hasan|Sulayman bin Hasan]], the grandson of 24th Da'i, was wali in Yemen and claimed the succession, supported by the other Yemeni Bohra. However, the Indian Bohra denied his claim of nass, declaring supporting documentation to be forged. The two factions separated, with the followers of Sulayman becoming the [[Sulaymanis]], and the followers of 27th Da'i Dawoodji Burhaanuddin bin Qutubshah becoming the Dawoodi Bohra.\n\nAfter the death of the 28th Da'i, [[Aadam Safiuddin]], in 1030 AH/1621 AD, a small faction of Alavi Bohra in Ahmedabad recognized his grandson Ali bin Ibrahim<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alavibohra.org/haqqaaniyat%20of%20maulaa%20ali%20saheb%20from%20dawat%20mss.htm|title=Saiyedna Ali|last=Shaheed Aazam|first=29th Alavi Da'i|date=2014-08-25}}</ref> (1046 AH/ 1637 AD) who was Mazoon, Mansoos and treasurer of Kutub e Da'wat, as his successor and got separated in 1030 AH from the majority Dawoodi Bohra who believed in [[Abduttayyeb Zakiuddin]], and Alavi Bohras<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|publisher=Cambridge University Press & Institute of Isma'ili Studies|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-61636-2|location=UK|pages=238\u2013239, 261\u2013264, 276, 277, 515, 522}}</ref> followed a separate line of Du'aat residing mainly in Vadodara (Gujarat, India) where they have their own locality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Muslim Communities in Gujarat|last=Misra|first=Satish C|publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt Ltd|year=1985|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=73}}</ref> Ali was supported by his uncle and secured very few followers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Shi'a of India|last=Hollister|first=John Norman|publisher=Oriental Books Reprint Corporation|year=1979|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=277}}</ref> Ali never carried his protest to the court of Mughal Emperor Jahangir to declare him as a legitimate Da'i.

Because of their abstention from eating meat they were called Nagoshias (non meat eaters). They followed their separate line of leaders for the next 100 years.

It was the result of their perseverance and efforts that people started believing and accepting the Isma\u2019ili-Taiyebi principles and gradually the mission of Yemen gave birth to a new community in India \u2013 '''[[Fatimid Caliphate|The Bohras]]'''.  The succession of those designated learned people who worked as deputies of the missionaries of Yemen came to be known as '''''Wulaat ul-Hind'''''<ref>http://alavibohra.org/wulaat%20ul-hind.htm</ref> in India. They were all in close contact with the spiritual authority of Yemen i.e. the ''[[Da'i al-Mutlaq|Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq]]'' after the seclusion of the 21st Imam, [[Taiyabi Ismaili|Abul Qaasim at-Taiyeb]] from Egypt.\n\nIn [[Ahmedabad]] between 825\u20131050 AH/1422-1640 AD the mainstream Bohra community got divided into 3 major groups. Among them, Alavi Bohras, who are mainly traders and merchants, are patriotic, peace-loving and harmonious people. The word \u2018Bohra-\u0628\u06be\u0631\u06c3 or Vohra or Vohorwu or Vyavahar' itself indicates maintaining healthy relations and is derived from the Gujarati word \u2018vohorvu\u2019 or \u2018vyavahar\u2019, which means '''\"to trade\"'''. Secondly its name reflects the characteristic of \"''al-Jamaa'at ul-Baaherah'' \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u06be\u0631\u06c3\" meaning the extraordinary brilliant community with full of life and love. Their cultural and social upbringing is such that the values of peace and prosperity are in their blood and they do not believe in '''social discord or religious conflicts'''.

[[Haatim Zakiyuddin]] is the 45th Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq of Alavi Bohras in the line of succession of these Da\u2019is in which 24 are in [[Yemen]], 7 are in [[Ahmedabad]], 1 is in Surat and 12 are in [[Vadodara]].\n\n=== Mazoon al-Mutlaq ===\n* \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0623\u0630\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642 \u2013 al-Mazoon al-Mutlaq, Mazoon e Mutlaq: The Licentiate, Authoritative Rank, the most trusted associate in Da\u2019wah ranks who takes [[Bay'at al-Imam|Bay\u2019at]]-Pledge of Loyalty from his subjects by the orders of Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq.  He is on a Spiritual Rank in the Isma\u2019ili Taiyebi Da\u2019wah hierarchy immediately below the authority of Da\u2019i who sits in his right side and who carries out the religious activities as per the regulations of Da\u2019wah organization. At any cost he always assists and obeys his superior and his Master, the Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq. His prime responsibility is to conduct teaching sessions and make them understand the basic things of Isma\u2019ili Taiyebi faith. In the absence of Da\u2019i he acts as his legatee. Da\u2019i may appoint his Mazoon as his successor. And if not Da\u2019i can appoint someone more learned and efficient for the post of Da\u2019i after him and can never disqualifies Mazoon from his post. As the respectable post of Mazoon is necessary for the completeness of Spiritual Hierarchy.  As far as Alavi Da'wah is concerned, from the time of 28th Da'i in Ahmedabad till 44th Da'i in Vadodara, every Mazoon has become Mansoos (successor) of a former Da'i. There exist not a single instance where Mazoon and Mansoos are separate entities. Da'i after examining minutely appoints his Mazoon only when he finds him eligible to be his successor. On the death of Mazoon, Da'i immediately appoints another trusted person on this rank.\n\n=== Mukaasir al-Mutlaq ===\n* \u0627\u0644\u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642 \u2013 al-Mukaasir al-Mutlaq, Mukaasir e Mutlaq \u2013 The Eight and the last rank in the Spiritual Hierarchy of the Isma\u2019ili Taiyebism.<ref>A branch of Isma'ilism who believe in the seclusion of Imam at-Tayyeb, the son of Fatimid caliph Imam al-Amir from Cairo in 528/1134 and then began the succession of his representatives from Yemen in 532/1138 known as du'aat e mutlaqeen and majority of them are today known as Bohras</ref> He sits left to the Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq during the religious gathering-Majlis.

He is quite expert in putting Rational and Logical arguments with necessary ideological and doctrinal proofs and healthy debates. On the death of Mukaasir, Da'i entrusts this rank to one of his close associates.

It is one of the [[Names of God in Islam|beautiful attributes of Allaah]] the Almighty.  This term is used 19 times in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] and it is equal to the letters if \"Bismillaah ir Rahman ir Raheem\", the beginning of the Qur'an and the most recited verse in the [[Muslim world|Islamic World]].  The completion of any supplication (''du'aa''-\u062f\u0639\u0627\u0621) is endorsed with the Salaam (''salawaat''-\u0635\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062a) on the [[Prophets of Islam|Prophets]] and their households.  It also refers to the prescribed [[Zakat|Islamic voluntary or compulsory monetary payments]] done by a believer throughout the year to the [[Da'i al-Mutlaq|Da'i]] (missionary).  It is the basic element of [[Islamic etiquettical jurisprudence|Islamic etiquette]] and ethics.  It is regarded as good practice to start any talk with \"as-''salaam''o 'alaykum\"-\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u06a9\u0645 (peace be upon you).  The greeting of the people of Paradise-\u0627\u06be\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u06c3 is Salaam.  The faith of [[Islam]] is nothing but ''Salaam''.  The core of  Islam is to remain in Peace and to make others feel Peace. A believer must do ''salaam & qadam-bosi''-\u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0628\u0648\u0633\u064a (to kiss right knee of an Imam) after every prayer (''namaaz'').  Salaam is that a believer bows down in front of an Imam then holds his right hand while keeping his right eye first then left eye then forehead and at the end kisses his hand.  This he does 2 times.  Then at the end kisses his right knee and does request for ''[[Dua|Du'aa]]'' and blessings.  This refers to the [[Hadith|Prophetic tradition]] that, \"Paradise is underneath the Feet of Mothers,\" Mothers here means the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]] or his representative (''da'i'') from the progeny of [[Muhammad|Prophet Mohammad]].<blockquote>The Heart of the ''Qur'an'' is its Chapter ''Yaa Seen'' (36).  The heart of this chapter is its verse \"Peace is the word from a Merciful Lord\" (58).  The heart of this verse is ''Salaam''.  So truly speaking the essence of ''Qur'an'' is Peace.  The first sign of hypocrisy and enmity is to stop offering ''Salaam''. </blockquote><blockquote>Prophetic Traditions:<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Light in the Heavens: Sayings of the Prophet Mohammad|last=al-Qadi|first=al-Qudai|publisher=New York University Press|year=2016|isbn=9781479867851|location=New York|pages=4,7,11,16,31,77,83,125,131,141,157}}</ref><ref>This book \"Light in the Heavens\" has been edited and translated by Tahera Qutbuddin</ref> 1.

This Holy Tree is also related to the Good Utterance-\u06a9\u0644\u0645\u06c3 \u0637\u06cc\u0628\u06c3 i.e. the Imam from the Pure Progeny-\u0630\u0631\u06cc\u06c3 \u0637\u06cc\u0628\u06c3 of Prophet Mohammad who will remain all the time for the guidance of humanity.

They were [[Sulayhid dynasty|Saiyedna \u2018Ali bin Mohammad as-Sulayhi]], Saiyedna Ahmad al-Mukarram, [[Arwa al-Sulayhi|Saiyedatona Hurrat ul-Malekah Arwaa binte Ahmad]] and Saiyedna Lamak bin Maalik.

Faithfuls were in peace and harmony under their leadership.\n\nAfter the demise of Maulaana Imam Musta\u2019ali, his son, 20th Fatimid [[Al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah|Imam Maulaana Abu \u2018Ali Aamir]], ascended to the throne of [[Imamah (Ismaili doctrine)|Imamat]] on 17th Safar 495 AH/1101 AD. His period of Imamat is 31 yrs. He was martyred by his enemies in Cairo on the night of 4th Zul Qa\u2019dah 526 AH/1132 AD and died on the same night. Maulaatona Hurrat ul-Malekah, who was in Yemen during all these hard times, was preparing to establish firmly the institution of Fatimid Taiyebi Da'wat in Yemen in the name of the 21st Fatimid [[At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim|Imam Abul Qaasim Taiyeb]] who was born to 20th Imam Aamir on 4 Rabi' al-Aakhar 524 AH/1130 AD in Cairo. She acted as Hujjat-proof of Imam during this period.  She came to knew the fate of Fatimid Caliphate through the signs sent to her by 20th Imaam.  Saiyedna Lamak bin Maalik and Saiyedna Yahyaa bin Lamak learned the knowledge of Da\u2019wat from Maulaatona Hurrat ul-Malekah that helped her by all means in the administration of Da\u2019wat. This was a crucial time when there was an imminent fall of Caliphate in Cairo and simultaneous reinforcement and establishment of Fatimid Da\u2019wat in Yemen.\n\nThere were numerous Hudood<ref name=\":5\" /> who were seeking the knowledge of Da\u2019wat by the permission of Maulaatona Hurrat ul-Malekah from Saiyedna Lamak bin Maalik and Saiyedna Yahyaa bin Lamak. Out of all Hudood, Saiyedna Zo\u2019eb bin Moosa and Saiyedna as-Sultan al-Khattaab were outstanding in grasping the teachings and intricacies of the Fatimid Da\u2019wat. They both clearly stood out of the group in their smartness and intelligence. With the permission of Maulaatona Hurrat ul-Malekah, they were ascended to the higher ranks of the Hudood and were given privilege to acquire the complete knowledge of Da\u2019wat. These two personalities, in future, were to become pivotal forces in the beginning of the succession of Du\u2019aat ul-Akrameen-missionaries in Yemen. Maulaatona Hurrat ul-Malekah now had two more loyal Hudood to support her. No one knew, but this was Hikmat (wisdom) of Allaah that within a span of 10 years Saiyedna Lamak bin Maalik and Saiyedna Yahyaa bin Lamak died in Yemen,  In their absence, Saiyedna Zo\u2019eb bin Moosa and Saiyedna as-Sultaan al-Khattaab served Da\u2019wat with full devotion in such a way that Maulaatona Hurrat ul-Malekah never felt void of anyone.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nBefore her death on 22nd Sha'baan 532 AH/1138 AD, she appointed Saiyedna Zo'eb as the First [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]] \u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642 of three 3 jazaa'ir Hind, Sindh and Yemen.

Ahmedabad is the only place where mausoleums of the missionaries-''du'aat'' of 3 Bohra communities are located.  This place is the converging point for all.|229x229px]]\nDuring the 11th century AD, when 18th [[Al-Mustansir Billah|Fatimid Imam Ma\u2019ad al-Mustansir]] was in power in [[Cairo]], the region of [[Khambhat]], [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] and [[Siddhpur]] saw extensive activities of [[Isma'ilism|Isma\u2019ili Da\u2019wat]] and then after the concealment of the 21st [[At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim|Fatimid Imam at-Taiyeb]] in 532 AH/1138 AD, the holy preachers and propagandists worked under the absolute guidance of their religious chief-[[Da'i al-Mutlaq|''da\u2019i'' ''al-mutlaq'']] who were serving as a representatives of their concealed Imam.  These preachers served as the head of the Da'wat in Indian subcontinent, locally known as the ''wali'' or ''maulaai,'' were regularly selected by the ''da'i al-mutlaq'' residing in Yemen.<ref name=\":4\" />  It was during the ''da\u2019iship'' of 17th Da\u2019i Hasan Badruddin (809\u2013821 AH/ 1406\u20131418 AD), the city of [[Ahmedabad]] was founded and [[Ahmad Shah I|Ahmadshah]] invited Adam Shujaa\u2019uddin bin Sulaimaan, Shaikha Mujaal and Khwaaja Kalaan to convince the Bohra traders and rich merchants to start their trade from Ahmedabad and make it their home-town.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ashaab ul Yameen|last=Mohammad|first=Nuruddin|publisher=Da'wat e Haadiyah 'Alaviyah|year=2011|isbn=|location=Vadodara, Gujarat|pages=76}}</ref> Till the time of 19th Da'i Idrees Imaaduddin (832-872 AH/1428-1468 AD), due to the efforts of  Adam Shujaa\u2019uddin sizable Bohras migrated from Patan to Ahmedabad.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Haqq na Du'aato ni Tawaareekh|last=|first=|publisher=Progressive Publications|year=1974|isbn=|location=Surat|pages=93}}</ref>\n\nSo this was the period of the first Bohra settlement in Ahmedabad as it proved to be a safe haven for the peace-loving community scattered in the other towns surrounding Ahmedabad.  At that time sizable Bohra population could be found at Patan, Khambhat, Siddhpur, [[Nadiad]], [[Kapadvanj|Kapadwanj]], [[Bharuch]], [[Vadodara]], [[Umreth]], [[Mehsana]], [[Dholka]] etc.  Bohras prospered in Ahmedabad but it was overshadowed with some brutal and gruesome attacks now and then by the Muslim Sultanate.  The Bohras of Gujarat and their ''da'is'' were not persecuted by the local Hindu rulers, who did not feel endangered by their activities.  The community thus developed without any hindrance until the Muslim conquest of [[Gujarat]] in 697 AH/1298 AD, when the Da'wat's activities came under the scrutiny of the region's Muslim governors, who recognized the suzerainty of the [[Sultan of Delhi|Sultans of Delhi]], who belonged to the [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]] and [[Tughlaq dynasty|Tughluqid]] dynasties.<ref name=\":4\" />  It was chiefly because of Ja\u2019far Patani Naherwali and his people who left [[Ahl al-Bayt|Isma\u2019ili-Taiyebi faith]] and accepted [[Sunni Islam|Sunnism]] and they constantly instigated local Muslim rulers against the Bohras.  During the time between 850\u2013950 AH/1447-1544 AD many preachers-''Maulaai''<ref>Maulaai: Spiritual representative of Da'i al-Mutlaq enjoying the respectable position and protecting Isma'ili faith in every aspects under the direct instructions of Da'i</ref> were martyred or jailed.  Ahmedabad became to be called \"Nani [[Karbala]]a\" (small karbalaa) because of the large number of martyrs buried there and also \"Baagh-e-Aal-e-Mohammad\" (paradise of [[Ahl al-Bayt|Ahl e Bayt]]).<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=Hadaa'iq Sirat e Fozalaa e Ahmedabad|last=Diwanji|first=Hayderali|publisher=Matba e Mohammadi|year=1944|isbn=|location=Mumbai|pages=33, 61}}</ref> 28th ''da'i al-mutlaq'' Shaykh Adam Safiyuddin (d. 1030 AH/1621 AD) held the key leadership and played pivotal role in managing the internal community matters and external political affairs in Ahmedabad during the time of various ''da'is'', he studied with 24th ''da'i'' in Yemen and was authorized to propagate the mission-''da'wat'' in the Deccan.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nDuring the rule of [[Akbar|Mughal Emperor Akbar]] & [[Jahangir]], Bohra community witnessed 2 major splits in Ahmedabad.  The Bohras got divided into three major groups viz. Alavis, [[Dawoodi Bohra|Dawoodis]] and Sulaimanis in the span of nearly 40 years- 997\u20131030 AH/1589-1621 AD.  This way Ahmedabad today enjoys the only converging place of all the three Bohra groups after the splits as their ''du\u2019aat''-missionaries are buried in the same graveyard located at '''''Saraspur (Bibipur)'''''. Due to the constant persecution by the Muslim rulers, Bohras left Ahmedabad permanently and shifted their seat of Da\u2019wat.<ref name=\":8\" />  Alavi Bohras migrated to Vadodara in 1110 AH/1699 AD during the ''da'iship'' of 32nd ''da'i'' acting on the will of his predecessor and they were the last among Bohras to leave Ahmedabad.  Dawoodi Bohras migrated to [[Jamnagar]] in 1065 AH/1657 AD and Sulaimani Bohras had their centre in [[Yemen]] after the split.  Among Bohras in Ahmedabad, today Alavi Bohras remain as a minority with small number of families stay there.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Name of the Da'i (Saiyedna \u2013 \u0633\u06cc\u062f\u0646\u0627)\n!Death \u2013 \u062a\u0623\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644\n!Period of Da'wat \u2013 \u0645\u062f\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0639\u0648\u06c3\n!Licentiate \u2013 \u0645\u0623\u0630\u0648\u0646\n!Associate \u2013 \u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0633\u0631\n!Works \u2013 \u062a\u0623\u0644\u06cc\u0641\u0627\u062a\n|-\n|25.\n|Jalaal Fakhruddin bin Hasan \n|16 Rabi' II 975 AH \u2013 19/10/1567 AD\n|4 mts\n|Dawoodji Burhaanuddin bin 'Ajabshah\n|Dawoodji Burhaanuddin bin Qutubshah\n|\n|-\n|26.\n|Dawoodji Burhaanuddin bin 'Ajabshah\n|27 Rabi' II 999 AH \u2013 21/2/1591 AD\n|24 yrs 11 days\n|Dawoodji Burhaanuddin bin Qutubshah\n|Shaikh AdamSafiyuddin bin Taiyebshah\n|\n|-\n|27.\n|Dawoodji Burhaanuddin bin Qutubshah\n|15 Jumaadi II 1021 AH \u2013 12/8/1612 AD\n|22 yrs 1 mt 18 days\n|al-Qaazi Ameenshah Shujaa'uddin, Shaikh Adam Safiyuddin bin Taiyebshah\n|Ameenjibin Jalaal\n|\n|-\n|28. \n|Shaikh Adam Safiyuddin bin Taiyebshah\n|7 Rajab 1030 AH \u2013 27/5/1621 AD\n|9 yrs 21days\n|Ali Mohammad bin Firoz, 'Ali bin Ibraahim\n|Ameenji bin Jalaal\n|\n|-\n|29.\n|'Ali bin Ibraahim bin Shaikh Adam Safiyuddin, the martyr\n|23 Zul Qa\u2019adah 1046 AH \u2013 17/4/1637 AD\n|16 yrs 4 mts 16 days\n|Taiyeb Zakiyuddin bin Shaikh Adam Safiyuddin\n|Ameenji bin Jalaal, Hasan Badruddin bin Wali\n|Kitaab un-Naseehah fi Anwaar ish-Shari'ah \u2013 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0635\u06cc\u062d\u06c3 \u0641\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u06cc\u0639\u06c3\n|-\n|30.\n|Taiyeb Zakiyuddin bin Shaikh Adam Safiyuddin\n|13 Shawwaal 1047 AH \u2013 26/2/1638 AD\n|10 mts 20 days\n|Hasan Badruddin bin Wali\n|Jivabhai Ziyauddin bin Nuhji\n|\n|-\n|31\n|Hasan Badruddin bin Wali\n|19 Rabi' II 1090 AH \u2013 29/5/1679 AD\n|42 yrs 6 mts 6 days\n|Jivabhai Ziyauddin bin Nuhji\n|Hebatullaah Mo'ayyaduddin bin Jivabhai Ziyauddin\n|Diwaan-e-Hasan \u2013 \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u062d\u0633\u0646\n|}\n\n=== Vadodara ===\n[[File:Alavi bohras syedi musanji saheb mosque.jpg|alt=majlis in musanji taaj saheb mosque|thumb|Aqaa Maulaa, the then Mazoon e Mutlaq visited Fakhri Masjid in Moharram 1436 AH/2014 AD on the death anniversary of [[Saiyedi Musanji bin Taaj saheb]]]]\n\nThe city of [[Vadodara]] deserves a special attention along with the Taiyebi missionary activities in [[Ahmedabad]] as many devoted personalities worked hard to retain the community faith when the turmoil of dissidents created by Ja\u2019far Naherwali was at its peak.  During the time of 21st Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq Saiyedna saheb (tus) Hasan Badruddin bin Idrees (d.  933 AH/1537 AD) when [[Gujarat Sultanate|Mahmood Shah II]] was the sultan of Gujarat, Mulla Isma\u2019il of Vadodara migrated to Ahmedabad and he was martyred along with his accomplices on the banks of [[Sabarmati River|Sabarmati river]].<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nVadodara is the birthplace of 28th, 29th and 30th Alavi Da'is who migrated and did Da\u2019wat in Ahmedabad from 1021\u20131047 AH/1612-1638 AD.  It was the place called Fakhri Mohalla near [[Vadodara|Gendi gate]] in the Walled city area where all 3 of them lived.  Till date this mohalla is populated by Alavi Bohras.  During the time of 26th Da'i al-Mutlaq Saiyedna Dawoodji Burhanuddin bin \u2018Ajabshah (d. 997 AH/1589 AD) when [[Muzaffar Shah III]] ruled Gujarat, Saiyedi Musanji bin Taaj saheb<ref>https://www.alavibohra.org/Saiyedi%20Musanji%20shaheed%20history.htm</ref> (d. 986 AH/1578 AD) of Vadodara was martyred in the Mandvi gate when he invited Saiyedna saheb to inaugurate the mosque which he had built after returning from Hajj, avoiding Salaahuddin the then governor of Muzaffar Shah III.

He spearheaded the cause of migration and in 1110 AH/1699 AD he established a new locality for the community where he built Ziyaai Masjid<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alavibohra.org/masjid-e-ziyaaii.htm|title=Alavi Bohras \u2013 Exclusive Feature \u2013 Masjid-e-Ziyaaii|website=www.alavibohra.org}}</ref> and Badri Mohalla.  Badri Mohalla proved a cradle of progress and prosperity for the entire community.  An Alavi Bohra who resides anywhere in the world and he visits Vadodara has to come to Badri Mohalla as the residence of Saiyedna saheb is located right in the middle of it.\n\nSince 328 years (1110\u20131438 AD/1699-2017 AD), Vadodara has remained the centre and the seat of modern Alavi Bohras<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mullahs on the Mainframe: Islam and Modernity among the Daudi Bohras|last=Blank|first=Jonah|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2001|isbn=0226056767|location=Chicago|pages=43}}</ref> (ad-Da\u2019wat ul-Haadiyat ul-\u2018Alaviyah<ref name=\":8\" />) where 12 of its missionaries (du\u2019aat) are buried here with a short interlude when 35th Da'i did Da\u2019wat in Surat for 19 years between 1158-1178 AH/1745-1764 AD.  Except 35th Da'i, all of them are from the progeny of Noohji bin Mohammadji, the father of 32nd Da'i.  The present 45th Da'i Saiyedna [[Haatim Zakiyuddin]] saheb is the descendant from the same Aal-e-Noohji.  Badri Mohalla, Fakhri Mohalla, Ajwa Road, Taiwada, Fatehgunj, Mughalwada, Pratapnagar, Panigate are the main areas of Vadodara where Alavi Bohras stay.  They have 4 mosques and 3 community halls in Vadodara.\n\nDuring the time of 41st Da'i al-Mutlaq Saiyedna Jivabhai Fakhruddin (d. 1347 AH/1929 AD), ''' '''Gaekwadi ruler Maharaja [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III|Sayajirao III]] (d. 1358 AH/1939 AD) ruled Vadodara and he single-handedly spearheaded its progress and prosperity.  Saiyedna maintained cordial and healthy relationship with the ruler as during the festivals Saiyedna often sent delegation in the Gaekwadi royal court to represent Alavi Bohras.  This was because most of the shops of Alavi Bohras were located in the narrow streets surrounding the Mandvi area involved in the business of turban making.  At that time Alavi Bohras had a monopoly of making red turban laced with golden string and Gaekwadi courtiers used to frequent these shops.   Today, many Alavi Bohras are having their shops in this area inherited from their forefathers is the testimony of the social relations with [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]].\n\n=== Surat ===\n[[File:Urs surat syedna nuruddin saheb 1435.jpg|alt=qabr of syedna nuruddin saheb|thumb|Mausoleum of 35th Alavi Da'i Saiyedna Noorbhai Nuruddin saheb in Surat]]\n\nWhen Saiyedna Jivabhai Ziyauddin saheb, the 32nd Da'i al-Mutlaq migrated from [[Ahmedabad]] to [[Vadodara]] in 1110 AH/1699 AD, Saiyedi Shaikhali from [[Surat]] along with his son Noorbhai visited Saiyedna saheb when he was busy constructing the mosque at the corner of Badri Mohalla named Masjid-e-Ziyaai.  During that time Noorbhai was very young and with pure intellect he witnessed the spiritual supremacy of Saiyedna saheb.  Saiyedna saheb ordered Saiyedi Shaikhali to leave Noorbhai in Vadodara for religious education and training and granted him all the permissions to carry out community responsibilities of Surat.   Saiyedi Shaikhali was a successful merchant but at the same time an ardent follower of Saiyedna saheb.  Along with many Alavi Bohra families, he stayed in Noorpura Mohalla near Jhapa bazaar. In the same area there was a mosque, graveyard and musaafir-khaana that were managed by Saiyedi Shaikhali.  After his death, Alavi Bohras of Surat relied upon Noorbhai for all Da\u2019wat<ref name=\":8\" /> affairs as he was among the most trusted Hudood <ref name=\":5\" /> of Saiyedna saheb, the 33rd Da'i Hebatullaah Mo'ayyaduddin.\n\nSaiyedna Hebatullaah Mo'ayyaduddin, conferred him the status of Mukaasir<ref name=\":13\" /> by bestowing him the epithet of \"Nuruddin-\u0646\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 (the light of religion)\".  He often visited Vadodara along with the people of Surat and used to give oath of loyalty<ref name=\":12\" /> to Saiyedna saheb.  Surat city became the centre of Alavi Bohras, though for a short period of time i.e. 19 years<ref name=\":14\" /> was only because of the pure heartedness and trustworthiness of Noorbhai Nuruddin, the 35th Da'i of Alavi Bohras.  This was the time when Surat witnessed the transition period from Mughal rule to [[British Raj|British dominion]] and the place where Saiyedna Noorbhai Nuruddin lived in the railway station area near [[Tapti River|Tapi river]] is considered the oldest area of the city and it is from here that the development of the city started in the early 20th century AD. After his death in 1178 AH/1764 AD, his son Shaikh Adam stayed in Surat and looked after the community like his father and grandfather.  During this time there were around 50 Alavi Bohra families staying in Surat.  The centre again got transferred to [[Vadodara]] and majority of Alavi Bohras migrated there along with their identity and surname as '''''\u201cSurtis\u201d'''''.

God has successively dispatched six prophets bearing a law (shari\u2019ah): Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ and Muhammad. These prophets are \u2018speakers\u2019<ref>A speaking or divine law-announcing prophet who brings a new set of religious law based on the Oneness of God.</ref> (naatiq-\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0642), because they talk to men, proclaiming to them a shari\u2019ah, an exoteric (zaahir-\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631) law with its commandments and prohibitions, its ritual obligation and legal definitions. By the side of each prophet-speaker stands an authorized representative (wasi or asaas-\u0648\u0635\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0633\u0627\u0633) who knows and teaches eternally immutable \u2018esoteric meaning\u2019 (baatin-\u0628\u0627\u0637\u0646) of all these prescriptions and regulations-though only to a small number of the elect.\n\nThus, [[Adam]] and his son [[Cain and Abel|Abel]] at his side, [[Noah]] and his son [[Shem]], [[Abraham]]\u2019s wasi  was his son [[Ishmael|Ishmeal]], [[Moses]]\u2019s wasi was his brother Aron, and [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]\u2019s was Simon Peter. The speaker-prophet  of our era is [[Muhammad]]. His wasi or asaas is his cousin and son in law [[Ali|\u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib]]. The latter\u2019s descendents are the true imams of Islamic community (ummah); they alone know and transmit the \u2018esoteric meaning\u2019 of the divine revelation proclaimed by Prophet Muhammad. The imams, whose succession continued with the Fatimid caliphs in Cairo till the 21st imam [[At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim|Abul Qaasim at-Taiyeb]] and their succession is in its place till date though in seclusion, are thus the repositories of the divine message; they are the upholders of \u2018Knowledge\u2019 and \u2018Wisdom\u2019, which they transmit to their followers, they are the \u2018friends of God\u2019 (awliya Allah-\u0623\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647).<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nThe imams spread \u2018Knowledge\u2019 and \u2018Wisdom\u2019 based on exoteric and esoteric interpretation of divine law through \u2018Summoners\u2019, da\u2019is, these are propagators or missionaries who summon people to follow the true imam and instruct the individual who \u2018responds to the summons\u2019, al-mustajib or the initiate, through wise sayings and necessary knowledge. The missionary or Da'i as a teacher is the most characteristic figure of the Isma\u2019ili movement. From the very beginning, the Da'i's travelled far and wide to spread the good tidings.\n\n[[Tanzil|Tanzeel]]-\u062a\u0646\u0632\u06cc\u0644 or [[Tafsir]]-\u062a\u0641\u0633\u06cc\u0631 (outer meaning or commentary on the Qur'an) is completely based on [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|Ta\u2019weel]]-\u062a\u0623\u0648\u06cc\u0644 (inner meaning) without which Tanzeel becomes void and meaningless.  The everlasting beautiful outward appearance is from inside and that which could not be seen and could not be understood by everyone.   The belief that each and every Qur'anic verse has both outer and inner meaning as the same is the case with the sayings of Prophet Mohammad which are applicable and acceptable in all times till the last Day of Doom.\n\nAs distinct from the zaahir (evident meaning) of the literal wordings of sacred texts and religious prescriptions, notably the Qur'an and the Shari\u2019ah, the baatin is the inward, hidden or esoteric meaning having deep and stronger impact on the deeds and thoughts of the believers.<ref name=\":19\" />  In the Isma\u2019ili-Taiyebi gnosis the word baatin goes hand in hand with ta\u2019weel and it exclusively denotes the method of inducing the baatin for the [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|allegorical, symbolic and esoteric interpretation]] or spiritual-hermeneutic exegesis of historic events and the world of nature as described by the sacred Islamic texts.<ref name=\":4\" /> Ta\u2019weel became the hallmark of Isma\u2019ili thought and literature.  It is to manifest the hidden so as to unveil the true spiritual reality only to those who are properly initiated into the community and who have acknowledged the spiritual guidance of the rightful imam of his era or his representatives who possess the rightful authority to interpret Islam in all its dimensions.<ref name=\":9\" />  Qur'anic verses throws light on this subject in the following way:\n* And bestowed His favours, external and esoteric, in abundance on you? And yet there are men who contend about God without any knowledge or guidance or the Book enlightening.

The distinction between the zaahir and baatin was an integral part of the religious system of thought elaborated by the Isma\u2019ili missionaries of different periods and this particular process continued with the Taiyebis in [[Yemen]].  Below is a small example of esoteric text taken from Kitaab al-Kashf by Ja\u2019far b. Mansur al-Yemen in the mid 4th century AH/10th century AD.\n\n\"The Qur\u2019an begins with [[Basmala|bismillaah al-rahmaan al-raheem]] (\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u06cc\u0645); bismillaah is composed of seven letters.  twelve letters emerges from this and that are al-rahmaan al-raheem.  This verse is the beginning of the first chapter of Qur\u2019an surat ul-hamd which has total seven verses.  The seven letters, which are the bismillaah, signify the seven naatiq. The twelve letters that arise from these signify that for each naatiq there are twelve naqeebs or hujjats.<ref>A high rank person in the spiritual hierarchy of divine mission-da\u2019wah of Fatimid Imams and they were twelve in number each in charge of a separate da\u2019wah region called jazeerah (pl. jazaa\u2019ir)</ref>  Thus the twelve letters, which are al-rahmaan al-raheem, that arise from the seven lettered bismillaah, together become nineteen letters.  This signifies that from the naatiqs \u2013 after each naatiq \u2013 seven imaams and twelve hujjats arise, which makes nineteen.  The same is the case with pillars of Islam, in which there are seven pillars each having twelve traditions.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Apocalyptic History of the Early Fatimid Empire|last=Velji|first=Jamel A.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780748690886|location=Edinburgh|pages=62}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Zaahir-Exoteric\n!Baatin-Esoteric\n|-\n|Islam\n|Faith\n|-\n|Skies\n|Prophets\n|-\n|Qur'an \n|Household of Prophet Mohammad\n|-\n|Earth\n|Ali bin Abi Taalib\n|-\n|Temporal world\n|Spiritual world\n|-\n|Body      \n|Soul\n|-\n|Prayer\n|Spiritual Mission\n|-\n|Ka\u2019bah  \n|The Imam of the time\n|-\n|Water\n|Knowledge\n|-\n|Oath of Allegiance \n|The right path\n|-\n|Honeybee\n|Believer\n|-\n|Salt \n|Wisdom\n|-\n|Fruits\n|The Imams from the progeny of Prophets\n|}\n\n== Library ==\nPersonal Alavi Library<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Isma\u2019ilis: Their History and Doctrines|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|publisher=Cambridge University Press and IIS|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-61636-2|location=UK|pages=241}}</ref> housed in the Residence of Saiyedna saheb<ref>He is the Supreme Authority as a Da'i ul Mutlaq of Alavi Bohras during the seclusion of 21st Fatemi Imam Maulaana Abul Qasim at-Taiyeb</ref> is the centre of Isma'ili Studies with the special reference to Taiyebi Branch of Literature.  There are various Academic and Research Institutions which carry out studies on Isma'ili Taiyebi Literature basically starting from 225 AH till date based on [[Hadith|Ahaadees]],<ref>Actions, Sayings and Traditions of Mohammad al-Mustafaa, the last Prophet of Islam described in various pieces of Islamic Literature</ref> Akaaleem,<ref>Supplications, Wise Sayings and Traditions of Maulaana Ali al-Murtazaa, the Vicegerent of  Mohammad</ref> Riwaayaat<ref>Quotes, Events, Miraculous Descriptions, Sayings, Esoteric Meanings explained by the Imam or Da'i, from the progeny of Mohammad</ref> and historic events with the assistance of renowned and experienced scholars in their respective fields.  Specifically the study of Isma'ili Literature is a part and parcel of the studies of Near-Eastern Languages and Culture.  Generally every University that carries out these studies also includes the study of [[Arabic|Arabic Language]] which is harboured by Isma'ili scholars.  These specific, selective and special studies are centered in a very few Institutions which houses Isma'ili Taiyebi [[Manuscript]]s (MSS) found in Arabic.\n\nDuring the second half of 20th century AD and in the recent years the scholarly, critical and significant research work is being carried out in European, American and Middle-Eastern Universities.  But it always requires a second thought and important inputs based in Isma\u2019ili dogmas from the authoritative seat of Da\u2019wat.  Scholars who are not at all in the system of Isma\u2019ili Faith lacks that special touch while dealing or summarizing or translating texts of Core Beliefs.  It is because these Isma\u2019ili literary gems<ref>Books based on beliefs, customs, traditions, jurisprudence, justice, dialogue, history etc</ref> had been written by Du\u2019aat in presence of an Imam or by his commands.  It contains an Oath<ref name=\":16\">Bay'at-Pact of Promise taken from a reader that he will read, understand, copy and convey the text written by the author with its true spirit and pure meaning and will only study this book by the authority appointed by Imam or Da'i</ref> for the Imam on which its reader must have to follow and without one is not supposed to even open a book.\n\nAs these books which were guarded into the private possessions made its way to Scholars and Researchers, the central point of Oath was mindlessly neglected and anyone who had an access to these books started their work.  No doubt great efforts and hard work have been carried out by the researchers but still there remains always a dot of doubt.  The Institutions which possess rich and periodically diversified Isma\u2019ili manuscripts has now become epicenter of scholarly activities and academic journalism.  The centre of ad-Da\u2019wat ul-Haadiyat ul-\u2018Alaviyah<ref>The Spiritual Seat, Divine Mission and Heavenly Call of Da'i of Alavi Bohras linked to the first Prophet of Islam and the First Creation of Allaah</ref> houses several hundred manuscripts which is managed, preserved, conserved and enriched by the 45th [[Haatim Zakiyuddin|Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq Saiyedna saheb]].  This personal library contains some of the rare Islamic and Isma\u2019ili titles and with every passing day newer titles are added.\n\nThis collection is in direct access, supervision and control of Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq and therefore the nature and process of addition to the collection is also noteworthy and the fact that Da\u2019i being the sole authority of Isma\u2019ili-Taiyebi learning is cognizant of the contents of each and every MSS, old as well as recent ones.  It has been observed that due to the maintenance of secrecy of Isma\u2019ili Literature, the private family collections in Yemen, Sindh and Hind<ref>The three Jazirah-Islands controlled by Da'i al-Mutlaq after the Satr-concealment of the Imam of Progeny of Mohammad Rasoolullaah, the last messenger of Islam</ref> are never in direct access to the public domain nor the MSS were lent or shared to any aspirant of the study.   But the ad-Da\u2019wat ul-Haadiyat ul-\u2018Alaviyah collection despite its original and unique source, the Da\u2019i is lenient in sharing the MSS after thoroughly assessing the just and critical way of translating, editing and publishing.  Though the centre of \u2018Alavi Da\u2019wat do not directly invite scholars or researchers from foreign universities, but time and again many interested foreign scholars have come straightforwardly and studied Isma\u2019ili titles with the Da\u2019i himself from Iran, UK, US and Europe.\n\nAt times, when the scholars who worked for the critical study and edition of any Isma\u2019ili title they might be having only 2\u20133 MSS from different origins, i.e. where writer, place and period differ, there arose the demand for the consultation of more MSS. For this purpose, the MSS of \u2018Alavi Da\u2019wat collection because of its Indian origin, proved more fruitful for better text reading and editing.  The other salient feature of \u2018Alavi Library is that it is housed at the Da\u2019is residence and most of the MSS are copied by the Du\u2019aat from those which were brought to Vadodara when the Da\u2019wat headquarters were shifted from Ahmedabad.\n\nIt has been well-preserved and well-maintained by the Da\u2019i's great efforts. Like many other places where such MSS and bundled for centuries and remain in lock-and-key and are never referred or studies, the case is entirely different here. Here at \u2018Alavi Library, Da\u2019i consults and refers these MSS and accordingly copies its texts in individual papers for lecture purpose and hand over certain old MSS to his close aides to make its fresh copy by penning the entire text.  With age-old methods the preservation of the MSS is carried out. As Da\u2019i personally handles all the library affairs, the question of precaution, curing or fumigation never arises.  But the Du\u2019aat felt it compulsory to make a copy of every MSS as there was a constant fear of a single copy might get damaged by any unexpected accident or worm attack.  Every year more and more MSS are added to the collection and also they are copied as and when required.\n\nThe MSS copied by 45th Da'i al-Mutlaq Saiyedna Haatim Zakiyuddin saheb since 1405 AH/1985

Now in order to become a member of a community and begin his spiritual journey with an [[Imam]], he has to give unconditional and lifetime oath of fealty or the promise for loyalty to the Imam's representative i.e. [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]]. This divine tradition and sublime submission was initiated from heavens and will be continued till the last day of this creation.  The Prophets took this oath from their respective people of their time and they commanded their missionaries to do so in order to protect their faith.  The initiate is also bound by this oath to keep secret the [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric knowledge]] imparted to him by a hierarchy of teachers authorized by the Isma'ili Imam.<ref name=\":9\" />  He has to renew this oath to Imam every year on 18th Zul Hijjah known as [[Rabigh|Eid e Ghadeer e Khumm]]-\u0639\u06cc\u062f \u063a\u062f\u06cc\u0631 \u062e\u0645.  \n[[File:Majlis in a mosque.jpg|alt=majlis e husaini during Moharram|thumb|An assembly-majlis in a mosque during [[Muharram|Moharram]] where [[Da'i al-Mutlaq|Da'i]] delivers an extensive lecture with the mourning on [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Husain]]]]\nOnce the believer had solemnly bound himself through the oath, he could undergo a step-by-step introduction into 'wisdom'-not all at once, for that would exceed his mental capacity.  'You are being put to a test,' the Da'i would say to his disciples, 'For you are beginners, and a beginner is like an infant: you should start first with milk and only later nourish yourselves with food.'<ref name=\":18\" />  This \"M\" of Misaaq induces religious responsibility into faithful's life and it helps to bring maturity for social well-being. For this Qur\u2019an says that, \"When We made the covenant with the Prophets, and with you (O Mohammad), as with Noah and Abraham, Moses and Jesus son of Mary, a binding covenant,  (It was) so that Allah may ask the truthful of their sincerity.

[[Mosque|Masjid]] (\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f) \u2013 mosque:  After offering covenant to Da\u2019i, the head of the community, An Alavi tries his level best to fulfill all its obligations and this begins at the very doorstep of a mosque. The centrality of the mosque is inevitable for a believer.  Each and every socio-religious activity revolves around it.  Prophetic traditions says, \"The mosque is where the pious live.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> A believer goes three times daily to offer [[Salah|prayers]]. There he is educated and informed about different social programs and being a part of a community how he should serve his fellow members and actively participate in the social and welfare activities.  This '''\"M-\u0645\"''' of Masjid-Mosque proves to be a perfect training centre for creating responsibility, positivity, respect and thoughtfulness among people.  Being a learned and authoritative person, a Da'i in his capacity trains his followers in maintaining social etiquettes and ethos by imparting necessary knowledge in his sermons.  Da'i is the soul of the mosque and with his prostration, people in the mosque prostrates in front of Allah.  The Qur\u2019an says about a mosque which is the best place for worship, that \"O sons of Adam, attire yourselves at every time of worship; eat and drink, but do not be wasteful, for Allah does not like the prodigals.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.ahmedali/7:31|title=Tanzil \u2013 Quran Navigator {{!}} \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645|last=|first=|date=|website=tanzil.net|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>(al-Quran 7\u201331)\n\n4.

A holy person having special designation conferred by an Imam in the spiritual hierarchy is buried here. After offering prayers in a mosque people come to pay respect to the mausoleum and take [[Tawassul|waseelah]]-intercession while doing supplication to fulfill their wishes in front of Allah.  Usually mausoleum or tomb of a Da'i or a religious authority is situated besides the mosque.  It plays a key role in social bonding as each and every community member visit it daily or weekly or when he wishes.  If anyone visits a Rawzah-mausoleum of a particular Da'i then it is said that, he took blessings of all those people who were in the covenant of that Da'i. Mazaar of a Da'i is also called \"Rawzah\" as it is like a paradise and one can feel its fervor and freshness by spiritually attaching himself to Da'i.  Every believer is a martyr-Shahid and the mausoleum of a Da'i is the master of all martyrs who were from his believers.  Visiting mausoleum is like going to the entrance and gate of paradise. If one has learned Qur\u2019anic recitation in Madrasah, gave Misaaq to his Da'i and has an habit of coming to a mosque for prayers, then surely he will visit Mazaar.\n\nIn this account, Imam [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Ja'far as-Saadiq]] addresses Kufan people and encourages them to visit the tomb of [[Husayn ibn Ali|al-Husayn b.

As per the occasion and time, every member of the community more or less participates in these majlis.

Females are given the same status and freedom as the males of the communities, but the things should be done under the Islamic practices and social framework.  There are many initiatives carried out for the overall progress and development of the skills pertaining to ladies. In terms of eating habits, Alavi Bohras like each and every type of food and being a Gujarati say, \"yes\" to everything lawful and healthy. They are very peaceful people with no interests in behavior that is termed as unlawful in the society.  They believe in \"The Love for All\", gives the reward as, \"The Love from All\".\n\n===Website===\nIn 1425 AH/2004 AD during the time of 44th Da'i al-Mutlaq [[Abu Haatim Tayyib Ziyauddin|Saiyedna Abu Haatim Taiyeb Ziyauddin]] saheb, the website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alavibohra.org|title=Welcome to the Official Website of Shi'a Isma'ili Musta'alavi Taiyebi Alavi Bohras \u2013 Home page|website=www.alavibohra.org}}</ref> was conceptualized and launched with the sole aim of making the community and World aware of the History, Practices, Customs, Events, News, Principles, Calendar, Literature, Prayers, Business, Family and Social life, Education, Occupation etc. of Alavi Bohras.  It has been controlled, edited and promoted by the office of Saiyedna saheb.  Hence there remains no need to confirm any information and news of the community.  It can be said that, the World gets the first-hand information directly from the Da'i himself.  Since its launch it caters to each and every aspect of the community.  If any layman who doesn't know the ABC of Alavi Bohras, then by visiting the website no question of his will remain unanswered.  Every scholar or a researcher who is doing work on Alavi Bohras will dedfinitely have to go through this community website.\n\n===Mobile app===\nExclusive Mobile Application \"Ahl uz Zikr\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alientechsol.ahluzzikr|title=Ahl uz Zikr|first=Da'wat-e-Haadiyah, Alavi|last=Bohras|date=16 September 2017|publisher=|via=Google Play}}</ref> was launched in June 2016 on Android as well as on iOS platform. This application has now became  the main medium of connectivity between Da\u2019wat e Haadiyah-Chief Religious Authority and the community members. Office of Da'i saheb is gradually updating and adding all required features for community learning and development. Ahl uz Zikr has become the prime source of all Divine Knowledge apart  from the community website.

In Sindh and India too Wali-ul-Hind \u0648\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u06be\u0646\u062f were appointed by these Du'aat \u062f\u0639\u0627\u06c3 one after another until Wali-ul-Hind Ja'far, Abd ul Wahab and Qaasim Khan bin Hasan (11th and last Wali-ul-Hind, d.950AH, [[Ahmedabad]]). The last three wali were of great help in the era of the 21st to 24th Da'i i.e. Husaamuddin (921\u2013932 AH), Shamsuddin (933 AH), Izzuddin (933\u2013946 AH) and Najmuddin (946\u2013974 AH). It was during this time when the seat of Da'wat e Haadiyah was transferred to India from Yemen, that the 23rd Da'i ul-Mutlaq   \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642 Mohammed Izzuddin performed Nass (transfer of authority) on [[Yusuf Najmuddin ibn Sulaiman]] in Sidhpur, Gujarat, India.\n\nDue to constant harassment and persecution by the local [[Zaydi|Zaydi Shi'a]] ruler in Yemen, the 24th Da'i, Yusuf Najmuddin bin Sulayman (d.1567 AD), shifted the whole administration of the Da'wat Haadiyah  (rightly guided mission) to India but continued to live in Yemen in the last years of his tenure and died there in Taibah. See [[Al-Mutahhar]] for further information. The 25th Da'i [[Jalal Shamshuddin]] (d.1567 AD) was first Da'i to die in India and he was torch-bearer in establishing the representation (\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u06c3) of the Imam of the Time (\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646) from the progeny of Mohammad though he stayed for only 4 months on the Seat of Da'wat (\u0639\u0631\u0634 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0639\u0648\u06c3); his mausoleum is in Ahmedabad, India. As mentioned his tenure as a Da'i ul-Mutlaq was very short but he played a pivotal role as one of the most trusted person from Hudood and as a Mazoon during the period of 23rd and 24th Da'i.\n\nFollowing the death of the 26th Da'i Dawoodji Burhaanuddin bin Saiyedi Ajabshah in 997 AH/1591 AD in Ahmedabad, there was a dispute as to who was to succeed him. [[Suleman bin Hasan|Sulayman bin Hasan]], the grandson of 24th Da'i, was wali in Yemen and claimed the succession, supported by the other Yemeni Bohra. However, the Indian Bohra denied his claim of nass, declaring supporting documentation to be forged. The two factions separated, with the followers of Sulayman becoming the [[Sulaymanis]], and the followers of 27th Da'i Dawoodji Burhaanuddin bin Qutubshah becoming the Dawoodi Bohra.\n\nAfter the death of the 28th Da'i, [[Aadam Safiuddin]], in 1030 AH/1621 AD, a small faction of Alavi Bohra in Ahmedabad recognized his grandson Ali bin Ibrahim<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alavibohra.org/haqqaaniyat%20of%20maulaa%20ali%20saheb%20from%20dawat%20mss.htm|title=Saiyedna Ali|last=Shaheed Aazam|first=29th Alavi Da'i|date=2014-08-25}}</ref> (1046 AH/ 1637 AD) who was Mazoon, Mansoos and treasurer of Kutub e Da'wat, as his successor and got separated in 1030 AH from the majority Dawoodi Bohra who believed in [[Abduttayyeb Zakiuddin]], and Alavi Bohras<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|publisher=Cambridge University Press & Institute of Isma'ili Studies|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-61636-2|location=UK|pages=238\u2013239, 261\u2013264, 276, 277, 515, 522}}</ref> followed a separate line of Du'aat residing mainly in Vadodara (Gujarat, India) where they have their own locality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Muslim Communities in Gujarat|last=Misra|first=Satish C|publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt Ltd|year=1985|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=73}}</ref> Ali was supported by his uncle and secured very few followers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Shi'a of India|last=Hollister|first=John Norman|publisher=Oriental Books Reprint Corporation|year=1979|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=277}}</ref> Ali never carried his protest to the court of Mughal Emperor Jahangir to declare him as a legitimate Da'i. Unverified accounts of this episode could be found in many publications.  But Ali ordered his associate Hasan Badruddin in 1031 AH/1622 AD to go to the Mughal court in Lahore to meet Jahangir to complain on his behalf about the atrocities meted upon Alavis in Ahmedabad by their opponents.

Hasan Badruddin was not present at the time of the burial of Ali.<ref>''Diwaan-e-Shams'': 37th Da\u2019i-e-Mutlaq Shaikhali Shamsuddin bin Hameeduddin (d. 1248 AH/1833 AD)</ref>\n\nAli, the 29th Alavi Da'i was born in the walled city of Vadodara in Fakhri Mohalla, when 27th Da'i Dawoodji bin Saiyedi Qutubshah was alive in Ahmedabad. His father Ibrahim died during his childhood. He was Haafiz ul-Qur'an in a tender age and when his grandfather 28th Da'i Aadam brought him to Ahmedabad for further studies in Uloom-e-Da'wat in the majlis of 27th Da'i, by seeing face of Ali, 27th Da'i gave glad-tidings \u0628\u0634\u0627\u0631\u06c3 to 28th Da'i that, \"This son will become the Light of your Eyes, so educate him as he is going to become the man of great acclaim\"\n\nHolding that the era of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] had come to an end, a group of Alavi Bohras seceded in 1178 AH/1764 AD during the da'iship of 36th Da'i  Shamsuddin Hameeduddin in [[Vadodara]]. Because of their abstention from eating meat they were called Nagoshias (non meat eaters). They followed their separate line of leaders for the next 100 years.  In 1310 AH/1892 AD, 41st Alavi Da'i Jivabhai Fakhruddin summoned their elders and after explaining them the realities of [[Sharia|Shari'at]] he respectfully accepted them and took them into the fold of Alavi Bohras.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Meaning and origin of Bohras==\nIn India, during the time of the 18th Fatimid Imam, [[Al-Mustansir Billah]] around 486 AH/1093 AD, the designated learned people ''(wulaat -'' \u0648\u0644\u0627\u06c3) who were sent from '''Yemen''' by the celebrated missionaries (''du\u2019aat ul-balaagh''<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 \u062f\u0639\u0627\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u0627\u063a) under the guidance of the manifest ''Imam'' (as opposed to the imam of the time of seclusion) established the foundation of Isma\u2019ili-Taiyebi Da\u2019wat<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Creed of the Fatimids|last=W|first=Ivanow|publisher=|year=1936|isbn=|location=Bombay|pages=13\u201317}}</ref> in the region of '''[[Gujarat]]''' (Cambay or [[Khambhat]]). It was the result of their perseverance and efforts that people started believing and accepting the Isma\u2019ili-Taiyebi principles and gradually the mission of Yemen gave birth to a new community in India \u2013 '''[[Fatimid Caliphate|The Bohras]]'''.  The succession of those designated learned people who worked as deputies of the missionaries of Yemen came to be known as '''''Wulaat ul-Hind'''''<ref>http://alavibohra.org/wulaat%20ul-hind.htm</ref> in India. They were all in close contact with the spiritual authority of Yemen i.e. the ''[[Da'i al-Mutlaq|Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq]]'' after the seclusion of the 21st Imam, [[Taiyabi Ismaili|Abul Qaasim at-Taiyeb]] from Egypt.\n\nIn [[Ahmedabad]] between 825\u20131050 AH/1422-1640 AD the mainstream Bohra community got divided into 3 major groups. Among them, Alavi Bohras, who are mainly traders and merchants, are patriotic, peace-loving and harmonious people. The word \u2018Bohra-\u0628\u06be\u0631\u06c3 or Vohra or Vohorwu or Vyavahar' itself indicates maintaining healthy relations and is derived from the Gujarati word \u2018vohorvu\u2019 or \u2018vyavahar\u2019, which means '''\"to trade\"'''. Secondly its name reflects the characteristic of \"''al-Jamaa'at ul-Baaherah'' \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u06be\u0631\u06c3\" meaning the extraordinary brilliant community with full of life and love. Their cultural and social upbringing is such that the values of peace and prosperity are in their blood and they do not believe in '''social discord or religious conflicts'''. Some of the groups or clans of [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] in Gujarat who also are traders and do not belong to the mainstream Bohras<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|publisher=Cambridge University Press & Institute of Isma'ili Studies|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-61636-2|location=UK|pages=276}}</ref> have adopted the name of Vohra or Vora, owing to the fame and respect of the \"Bohra\" name. But they do not follow the basic doctrines and customs of the Isma'ili-Taiyebi Bohras. The early Indian converts of the 11th century AD during the reign of 18th Fatimid Imam Mustansir consisted of a single group of '''[[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]]''' Bohras owing allegiance to the missionaries (''du'aat ul-balaagh''<ref name=\":3\" />) who conveyed spiritual orders of manifest ''Imam'' (''imaam-e-zaahir'') to common believers in Yemen and India.\n\n== Present day==\nAbu Sa'eed il-Khayr Haatim Zakiyuddin<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alavibohra.org/history.htm|title=Saiyedna|last=Haatim|first=Zakiyuddin|date=2017-02-14|website=Team Alavi}}</ref> is the 45th Da'i e Mutlaq in the Line of Succession of Du'aat e Mutlaqeen<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alavibohra.org/duatofindia.htm|title=Du'aat Missionaries|last=Mutlaqeen|first=Succession in Vadodara|date=2015-12-10}}</ref> \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0639\u0627\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642\u06cc\u0646.

Indeed, there is a close analogy between the terrestrial hierarchy of the Fatimid Da'wat organization with its highest ranks of Naatiq (''Nabi'', prophet), Asaas (''Wasi'', vicegerent) and Imam, and the celestial or cosmological hierarchy developed during the period of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and strictly followed by the missionaries in India today.</blockquote>\n\n=== Designating a person on a spiritual rank ===\n* \u0646\u0635 \u2013 Nass: It is an explicit, clear and specific declaration and designation through [[Spirituality|Divine Indication]] and Spiritual Intervention-\u062a\u0623\u0626\u06cc\u062f \u0625\u0644\u06be\u064a for the appointment of a successor-\u0645\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0635, be it an Imam or his deputy-\u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a during Imam's concealment by his predecessor-\u0646\u0627\u0635 amongst his subjects, publicly-\u0646\u0635 \u062c\u0644\u064a or privately \u0646\u0635 \u062e\u0641\u064a and at times supported by written documentary orders-\u0633\u062c\u0644 \u0634\u0631\u06cc\u0641.  This tradition and practice-\u0633\u0646\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u06c1 is related to the Isma\u2019ili Taiyebi succession to the seat of Imaamat, whereby each Imam under hidden heavenly commands designates his successor, when he witnesses the [[Imamah (Ismaili doctrine)|Light of Imaamat]]-\u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645\u06c3 has got transferred to one of his sons whom he selects for Nass.  During the seclusion of Imam, his deputy-Da\u2019i performs this act of succession whom he finds eligible for the status of Da\u2019i.  He might not be from his sons, unlike the succession of Imam where an Imam always appoints his successor from one of his sons.  The succession of Imaamat has begun from the  [[Adam|Aadam Safiyullaah]]-\u0622\u062f\u0645 \u0635\u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u06c1 and will continue till the last day when [[Qiyaamah|Qaa\u2019im ul Qeyaamah]]-\u0642\u0627\u0626\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u06cc\u0627\u0645\u06c3 will act as the final authority on the Day of Judgement.\n\n=== Da'i al-Mutlaq ===\n[[File:Alavi Bohras-Saiyedna saheb aqaa maulaa.jpg|thumb|The 45th Da'i al-Mutlaq, [[Haatim Zakiyuddin]]]]\n* \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642\u060c \u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642 \u2013 ad-Da'i ul-Mutlaq or Da'i al-Mutlaq: It is the spiritual rank in [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili Da'wah]] which became more explicit and operational after the seclusion of 21st Fatimid Imam of Cairo, [[List of Fatimid caliphs|Abul Qaasim at-Taiyeb]] in 528 AH/1134 AD. After Mohammad this rank is on the 6th position and after this comes Mazoon-\u0645\u0623\u0630\u0648\u0646 and Mukaasir-\u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0633\u0631.  Before the seclusion the Da\u2019i or a missionary works under the direct orders of Imaam and his trusted associates in all the 12 islands-\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631 where faithful were present and living openly propounding their faith or secretly due to the fear of their lives. In Yemen, after the seclusion, Da\u2019i was given Itlaaq-\u0625\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642 or a free conduct and absolute religious and social authority but under the governing principles of Isma\u2019ili Taiyebi Faith.  His command is regarded as a final decree guided by the divine support of Imam and this is the reason he is called [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]]. Unlike the case of Imam, where he appoints his successor only from his sons through divinely guided practice called Nass-\u0646\u0635, the Da\u2019i can appoint anyone in his place who is most trusted, pious and capable of carrying Da\u2019wah affairs with wisdom and proficiency. [[Haatim Zakiyuddin]] is the 45th Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq of Alavi Bohras in the line of succession of these Da\u2019is in which 24 are in [[Yemen]], 7 are in [[Ahmedabad]], 1 is in Surat and 12 are in [[Vadodara]].\n\n=== Mazoon al-Mutlaq ===\n* \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0623\u0630\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642 \u2013 al-Mazoon al-Mutlaq, Mazoon e Mutlaq: The Licentiate, Authoritative Rank, the most trusted associate in Da\u2019wah ranks who takes [[Bay'at al-Imam|Bay\u2019at]]-Pledge of Loyalty from his subjects by the orders of Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq.  He is on a Spiritual Rank in the Isma\u2019ili Taiyebi Da\u2019wah hierarchy immediately below the authority of Da\u2019i who sits in his right side and who carries out the religious activities as per the regulations of Da\u2019wah organization. At any cost he always assists and obeys his superior and his Master, the Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq. His prime responsibility is to conduct teaching sessions and make them understand the basic things of Isma\u2019ili Taiyebi faith. In the absence of Da\u2019i he acts as his legatee. Da\u2019i may appoint his Mazoon as his successor. And if not Da\u2019i can appoint someone more learned and efficient for the post of Da\u2019i after him and can never disqualifies Mazoon from his post. As the respectable post of Mazoon is necessary for the completeness of Spiritual Hierarchy.  As far as Alavi Da'wah is concerned, from the time of 28th Da'i in Ahmedabad till 44th Da'i in Vadodara, every Mazoon has become Mansoos (successor) of a former Da'i. There exist not a single instance where Mazoon and Mansoos are separate entities. Da'i after examining minutely appoints his Mazoon only when he finds him eligible to be his successor. On the death of Mazoon, Da'i immediately appoints another trusted person on this rank.\n\n=== Mukaasir al-Mutlaq ===\n* \u0627\u0644\u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642 \u2013 al-Mukaasir al-Mutlaq, Mukaasir e Mutlaq \u2013 The Eight and the last rank in the Spiritual Hierarchy of the Isma\u2019ili Taiyebism.<ref>A branch of Isma'ilism who believe in the seclusion of Imam at-Tayyeb, the son of Fatimid caliph Imam al-Amir from Cairo in 528/1134 and then began the succession of his representatives from Yemen in 532/1138 known as du'aat e mutlaqeen and majority of them are today known as Bohras</ref> He sits left to the Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq during the religious gathering-Majlis.

He is quite expert in putting Rational and Logical arguments with necessary ideological and doctrinal proofs and healthy debates. On the death of Mukaasir, Da'i entrusts this rank to one of his close associates. In some cases, on the death of Mazoon, Da'i elevates Mukaasir to the rank of Mazoon.\n\n=== A Beginner in Isma'ili Taiyebi Faith ===\n* \u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u062c\u06cc\u0628 \u2013 Mu'min Mustajeeb \u2013 A Believer or a Beginner in Isma'ili Taiyebi Faith who pure-heartedly, respectfully, devotionally and uncondionally accepts the guidance from Mukaasir e Mutlaq and gives Oath of Obedience to all the Eight Spiritual Ranks viz. from Mukaasir to Nabi (prophet).

With every passing day he only learns and acquires the articles of faith which his Superiors think beneficial for him. As he is a beginner, as per Isma'ili Faith, he cannot doubt or question a little bit on any command of his Masters (\u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0645).\n\n=== Salaam and Qadam-bosi ===\n[[File:Salaam and qadambosi.jpg|alt=Respect of Saiyedna saheb|thumb|Paying respect by offering Salaam and performing Qadam-bosi to Saiyedna saheb]]\n\n* \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u2013 Salaam \u2013 Salutation, Safety, Greeting, Peace or Respect of a person with Spiritual status or a general believer of ''Da'wat ul-Haqq'' (mission of truth).  It is one of the [[Names of God in Islam|beautiful attributes of Allaah]] the Almighty.  This term is used 19 times in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] and it is equal to the letters if \"Bismillaah ir Rahman ir Raheem\", the beginning of the Qur'an and the most recited verse in the [[Muslim world|Islamic World]].  The completion of any supplication (''du'aa''-\u062f\u0639\u0627\u0621) is endorsed with the Salaam (''salawaat''-\u0635\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062a) on the [[Prophets of Islam|Prophets]] and their households.  It also refers to the prescribed [[Zakat|Islamic voluntary or compulsory monetary payments]] done by a believer throughout the year to the [[Da'i al-Mutlaq|Da'i]] (missionary).  It is the basic element of [[Islamic etiquettical jurisprudence|Islamic etiquette]] and ethics.  It is regarded as good practice to start any talk with \"as-''salaam''o 'alaykum\"-\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u06a9\u0645 (peace be upon you).  The greeting of the people of Paradise-\u0627\u06be\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u06c3 is Salaam.  The faith of [[Islam]] is nothing but ''Salaam''.  The core of  Islam is to remain in Peace and to make others feel Peace. A believer must do ''salaam & qadam-bosi''-\u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0628\u0648\u0633\u064a (to kiss right knee of an Imam) after every prayer (''namaaz'').  Salaam is that a believer bows down in front of an Imam then holds his right hand while keeping his right eye first then left eye then forehead and at the end kisses his hand.  This he does 2 times.  Then at the end kisses his right knee and does request for ''[[Dua|Du'aa]]'' and blessings.  This refers to the [[Hadith|Prophetic tradition]] that, \"Paradise is underneath the Feet of Mothers,\" Mothers here means the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]] or his representative (''da'i'') from the progeny of [[Muhammad|Prophet Mohammad]].<blockquote>The Heart of the ''Qur'an'' is its Chapter ''Yaa Seen'' (36).

She acted as Hujjat-proof of Imam during this period.  She came to knew the fate of Fatimid Caliphate through the signs sent to her by 20th Imaam.  Saiyedna Lamak bin Maalik and Saiyedna Yahyaa bin Lamak learned the knowledge of Da\u2019wat from Maulaatona Hurrat ul-Malekah that helped her by all means in the administration of Da\u2019wat. This was a crucial time when there was an imminent fall of Caliphate in Cairo and simultaneous reinforcement and establishment of Fatimid Da\u2019wat in Yemen.\n\nThere were numerous Hudood<ref name=\":5\" /> who were seeking the knowledge of Da\u2019wat by the permission of Maulaatona Hurrat ul-Malekah from Saiyedna Lamak bin Maalik and Saiyedna Yahyaa bin Lamak. Out of all Hudood, Saiyedna Zo\u2019eb bin Moosa and Saiyedna as-Sultan al-Khattaab were outstanding in grasping the teachings and intricacies of the Fatimid Da\u2019wat. They both clearly stood out of the group in their smartness and intelligence. With the permission of Maulaatona Hurrat ul-Malekah, they were ascended to the higher ranks of the Hudood and were given privilege to acquire the complete knowledge of Da\u2019wat. These two personalities, in future, were to become pivotal forces in the beginning of the succession of Du\u2019aat ul-Akrameen-missionaries in Yemen. Maulaatona Hurrat ul-Malekah now had two more loyal Hudood to support her. No one knew, but this was Hikmat (wisdom) of Allaah that within a span of 10 years Saiyedna Lamak bin Maalik and Saiyedna Yahyaa bin Lamak died in Yemen,  In their absence, Saiyedna Zo\u2019eb bin Moosa and Saiyedna as-Sultaan al-Khattaab served Da\u2019wat with full devotion in such a way that Maulaatona Hurrat ul-Malekah never felt void of anyone.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nBefore her death on 22nd Sha'baan 532 AH/1138 AD, she appointed Saiyedna Zo'eb as the First [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]] \u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642 of three 3 jazaa'ir Hind, Sindh and Yemen.

This place is the converging point for all.|229x229px]]\nDuring the 11th century AD, when 18th [[Al-Mustansir Billah|Fatimid Imam Ma\u2019ad al-Mustansir]] was in power in [[Cairo]], the region of [[Khambhat]], [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] and [[Siddhpur]] saw extensive activities of [[Isma'ilism|Isma\u2019ili Da\u2019wat]] and then after the concealment of the 21st [[At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim|Fatimid Imam at-Taiyeb]] in 532 AH/1138 AD, the holy preachers and propagandists worked under the absolute guidance of their religious chief-[[Da'i al-Mutlaq|''da\u2019i'' ''al-mutlaq'']] who were serving as a representatives of their concealed Imam.  These preachers served as the head of the Da'wat in Indian subcontinent, locally known as the ''wali'' or ''maulaai,'' were regularly selected by the ''da'i al-mutlaq'' residing in Yemen.<ref name=\":4\" />  It was during the ''da\u2019iship'' of 17th Da\u2019i Hasan Badruddin (809\u2013821 AH/ 1406\u20131418 AD), the city of [[Ahmedabad]] was founded and [[Ahmad Shah I|Ahmadshah]] invited Adam Shujaa\u2019uddin bin Sulaimaan, Shaikha Mujaal and Khwaaja Kalaan to convince the Bohra traders and rich merchants to start their trade from Ahmedabad and make it their home-town.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ashaab ul Yameen|last=Mohammad|first=Nuruddin|publisher=Da'wat e Haadiyah 'Alaviyah|year=2011|isbn=|location=Vadodara, Gujarat|pages=76}}</ref> Till the time of 19th Da'i Idrees Imaaduddin (832-872 AH/1428-1468 AD), due to the efforts of  Adam Shujaa\u2019uddin sizable Bohras migrated from Patan to Ahmedabad.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Haqq na Du'aato ni Tawaareekh|last=|first=|publisher=Progressive Publications|year=1974|isbn=|location=Surat|pages=93}}</ref>\n\nSo this was the period of the first Bohra settlement in Ahmedabad as it proved to be a safe haven for the peace-loving community scattered in the other towns surrounding Ahmedabad.  At that time sizable Bohra population could be found at Patan, Khambhat, Siddhpur, [[Nadiad]], [[Kapadvanj|Kapadwanj]], [[Bharuch]], [[Vadodara]], [[Umreth]], [[Mehsana]], [[Dholka]] etc.  Bohras prospered in Ahmedabad but it was overshadowed with some brutal and gruesome attacks now and then by the Muslim Sultanate.  The Bohras of Gujarat and their ''da'is'' were not persecuted by the local Hindu rulers, who did not feel endangered by their activities.  The community thus developed without any hindrance until the Muslim conquest of [[Gujarat]] in 697 AH/1298 AD, when the Da'wat's activities came under the scrutiny of the region's Muslim governors, who recognized the suzerainty of the [[Sultan of Delhi|Sultans of Delhi]], who belonged to the [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]] and [[Tughlaq dynasty|Tughluqid]] dynasties.<ref name=\":4\" />  It was chiefly because of Ja\u2019far Patani Naherwali and his people who left [[Ahl al-Bayt|Isma\u2019ili-Taiyebi faith]] and accepted [[Sunni Islam|Sunnism]] and they constantly instigated local Muslim rulers against the Bohras.  During the time between 850\u2013950 AH/1447-1544 AD many preachers-''Maulaai''<ref>Maulaai: Spiritual representative of Da'i al-Mutlaq enjoying the respectable position and protecting Isma'ili faith in every aspects under the direct instructions of Da'i</ref> were martyred or jailed.  Ahmedabad became to be called \"Nani [[Karbala]]a\" (small karbalaa) because of the large number of martyrs buried there and also \"Baagh-e-Aal-e-Mohammad\" (paradise of [[Ahl al-Bayt|Ahl e Bayt]]).<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=Hadaa'iq Sirat e Fozalaa e Ahmedabad|last=Diwanji|first=Hayderali|publisher=Matba e Mohammadi|year=1944|isbn=|location=Mumbai|pages=33, 61}}</ref> 28th ''da'i al-mutlaq'' Shaykh Adam Safiyuddin (d. 1030 AH/1621 AD) held the key leadership and played pivotal role in managing the internal community matters and external political affairs in Ahmedabad during the time of various ''da'is'', he studied with 24th ''da'i'' in Yemen and was authorized to propagate the mission-''da'wat'' in the Deccan.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nDuring the rule of [[Akbar|Mughal Emperor Akbar]] & [[Jahangir]], Bohra community witnessed 2 major splits in Ahmedabad.  The Bohras got divided into three major groups viz. Alavis, [[Dawoodi Bohra|Dawoodis]] and Sulaimanis in the span of nearly 40 years- 997\u20131030 AH/1589-1621 AD.  This way Ahmedabad today enjoys the only converging place of all the three Bohra groups after the splits as their ''du\u2019aat''-missionaries are buried in the same graveyard located at '''''Saraspur (Bibipur)'''''. Due to the constant persecution by the Muslim rulers, Bohras left Ahmedabad permanently and shifted their seat of Da\u2019wat.<ref name=\":8\" />  Alavi Bohras migrated to Vadodara in 1110 AH/1699 AD during the ''da'iship'' of 32nd ''da'i'' acting on the will of his predecessor and they were the last among Bohras to leave Ahmedabad.

It was the place called Fakhri Mohalla near [[Vadodara|Gendi gate]] in the Walled city area where all 3 of them lived.  Till date this mohalla is populated by Alavi Bohras.  During the time of 26th Da'i al-Mutlaq Saiyedna Dawoodji Burhanuddin bin \u2018Ajabshah (d. 997 AH/1589 AD) when [[Muzaffar Shah III]] ruled Gujarat, Saiyedi Musanji bin Taaj saheb<ref>https://www.alavibohra.org/Saiyedi%20Musanji%20shaheed%20history.htm</ref> (d. 986 AH/1578 AD) of Vadodara was martyred in the Mandvi gate when he invited Saiyedna saheb to inaugurate the mosque which he had built after returning from Hajj, avoiding Salaahuddin the then governor of Muzaffar Shah III.

He spearheaded the cause of migration and in 1110 AH/1699 AD he established a new locality for the community where he built Ziyaai Masjid<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alavibohra.org/masjid-e-ziyaaii.htm|title=Alavi Bohras \u2013 Exclusive Feature \u2013 Masjid-e-Ziyaaii|website=www.alavibohra.org}}</ref> and Badri Mohalla.  Badri Mohalla proved a cradle of progress and prosperity for the entire community.  An Alavi Bohra who resides anywhere in the world and he visits Vadodara has to come to Badri Mohalla as the residence of Saiyedna saheb is located right in the middle of it.\n\nSince 328 years (1110\u20131438 AD/1699-2017 AD), Vadodara has remained the centre and the seat of modern Alavi Bohras<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mullahs on the Mainframe: Islam and Modernity among the Daudi Bohras|last=Blank|first=Jonah|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2001|isbn=0226056767|location=Chicago|pages=43}}</ref> (ad-Da\u2019wat ul-Haadiyat ul-\u2018Alaviyah<ref name=\":8\" />) where 12 of its missionaries (du\u2019aat) are buried here with a short interlude when 35th Da'i did Da\u2019wat in Surat for 19 years between 1158-1178 AH/1745-1764 AD.  Except 35th Da'i, all of them are from the progeny of Noohji bin Mohammadji, the father of 32nd Da'i.  The present 45th Da'i Saiyedna [[Haatim Zakiyuddin]] saheb is the descendant from the same Aal-e-Noohji.  Badri Mohalla, Fakhri Mohalla, Ajwa Road, Taiwada, Fatehgunj, Mughalwada, Pratapnagar, Panigate are the main areas of Vadodara where Alavi Bohras stay.  They have 4 mosques and 3 community halls in Vadodara.\n\nDuring the time of 41st Da'i al-Mutlaq Saiyedna Jivabhai Fakhruddin (d. 1347 AH/1929 AD), ''' '''Gaekwadi ruler Maharaja [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III|Sayajirao III]] (d. 1358 AH/1939 AD) ruled Vadodara and he single-handedly spearheaded its progress and prosperity.  Saiyedna maintained cordial and healthy relationship with the ruler as during the festivals Saiyedna often sent delegation in the Gaekwadi royal court to represent Alavi Bohras.  This was because most of the shops of Alavi Bohras were located in the narrow streets surrounding the Mandvi area involved in the business of turban making.  At that time Alavi Bohras had a monopoly of making red turban laced with golden string and Gaekwadi courtiers used to frequent these shops.   Today, many Alavi Bohras are having their shops in this area inherited from their forefathers is the testimony of the social relations with [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]].\n\n=== Surat ===\n[[File:Urs surat syedna nuruddin saheb 1435.jpg|alt=qabr of syedna nuruddin saheb|thumb|Mausoleum of 35th Alavi Da'i Saiyedna Noorbhai Nuruddin saheb in Surat]]\n\nWhen Saiyedna Jivabhai Ziyauddin saheb, the 32nd Da'i al-Mutlaq migrated from [[Ahmedabad]] to [[Vadodara]] in 1110 AH/1699 AD, Saiyedi Shaikhali from [[Surat]] along with his son Noorbhai visited Saiyedna saheb when he was busy constructing the mosque at the corner of Badri Mohalla named Masjid-e-Ziyaai.  During that time Noorbhai was very young and with pure intellect he witnessed the spiritual supremacy of Saiyedna saheb.  Saiyedna saheb ordered Saiyedi Shaikhali to leave Noorbhai in Vadodara for religious education and training and granted him all the permissions to carry out community responsibilities of Surat.   Saiyedi Shaikhali was a successful merchant but at the same time an ardent follower of Saiyedna saheb.  Along with many Alavi Bohra families, he stayed in Noorpura Mohalla near Jhapa bazaar. In the same area there was a mosque, graveyard and musaafir-khaana that were managed by Saiyedi Shaikhali.  After his death, Alavi Bohras of Surat relied upon Noorbhai for all Da\u2019wat<ref name=\":8\" /> affairs as he was among the most trusted Hudood <ref name=\":5\" /> of Saiyedna saheb, the 33rd Da'i Hebatullaah Mo'ayyaduddin.\n\nSaiyedna Hebatullaah Mo'ayyaduddin, conferred him the status of Mukaasir<ref name=\":13\" /> by bestowing him the epithet of \"Nuruddin-\u0646\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 (the light of religion)\".  He often visited Vadodara along with the people of Surat and used to give oath of loyalty<ref name=\":12\" /> to Saiyedna saheb.  Surat city became the centre of Alavi Bohras, though for a short period of time i.e. 19 years<ref name=\":14\" /> was only because of the pure heartedness and trustworthiness of Noorbhai Nuruddin, the 35th Da'i of Alavi Bohras.  This was the time when Surat witnessed the transition period from Mughal rule to [[British Raj|British dominion]] and the place where Saiyedna Noorbhai Nuruddin lived in the railway station area near [[Tapti River|Tapi river]] is considered the oldest area of the city and it is from here that the development of the city started in the early 20th century AD. After his death in 1178 AH/1764 AD, his son Shaikh Adam stayed in Surat and looked after the community like his father and grandfather.  During this time there were around 50 Alavi Bohra families staying in Surat.  The centre again got transferred to [[Vadodara]] and majority of Alavi Bohras migrated there along with their identity and surname as '''''\u201cSurtis\u201d'''''. Today the tomb of Saiyedna Noorbhai Nuruddin is the most revered place where mosque, community hall and musaafir-khaana are situated.  For divine blessings every Alavi Bohra visit this place once in a year.

God has successively dispatched six prophets bearing a law (shari\u2019ah): Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ and Muhammad. These prophets are \u2018speakers\u2019<ref>A speaking or divine law-announcing prophet who brings a new set of religious law based on the Oneness of God.</ref> (naatiq-\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0642), because they talk to men, proclaiming to them a shari\u2019ah, an exoteric (zaahir-\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631) law with its commandments and prohibitions, its ritual obligation and legal definitions.

The speaker-prophet  of our era is [[Muhammad]]. His wasi or asaas is his cousin and son in law [[Ali|\u2018Ali ibn Abi Taalib]]. The latter\u2019s descendents are the true imams of Islamic community (ummah); they alone know and transmit the \u2018esoteric meaning\u2019 of the divine revelation proclaimed by Prophet Muhammad. The imams, whose succession continued with the Fatimid caliphs in Cairo till the 21st imam [[At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim|Abul Qaasim at-Taiyeb]] and their succession is in its place till date though in seclusion, are thus the repositories of the divine message; they are the upholders of \u2018Knowledge\u2019 and \u2018Wisdom\u2019, which they transmit to their followers, they are the \u2018friends of God\u2019 (awliya Allah-\u0623\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647).<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nThe imams spread \u2018Knowledge\u2019 and \u2018Wisdom\u2019 based on exoteric and esoteric interpretation of divine law through \u2018Summoners\u2019, da\u2019is, these are propagators or missionaries who summon people to follow the true imam and instruct the individual who \u2018responds to the summons\u2019, al-mustajib or the initiate, through wise sayings and necessary knowledge. The missionary or Da'i as a teacher is the most characteristic figure of the Isma\u2019ili movement.

The everlasting beautiful outward appearance is from inside and that which could not be seen and could not be understood by everyone.   The belief that each and every Qur'anic verse has both outer and inner meaning as the same is the case with the sayings of Prophet Mohammad which are applicable and acceptable in all times till the last Day of Doom.\n\nAs distinct from the zaahir (evident meaning) of the literal wordings of sacred texts and religious prescriptions, notably the Qur'an and the Shari\u2019ah, the baatin is the inward, hidden or esoteric meaning having deep and stronger impact on the deeds and thoughts of the believers.<ref name=\":19\" />  In the Isma\u2019ili-Taiyebi gnosis the word baatin goes hand in hand with ta\u2019weel and it exclusively denotes the method of inducing the baatin for the [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|allegorical, symbolic and esoteric interpretation]] or spiritual-hermeneutic exegesis of historic events and the world of nature as described by the sacred Islamic texts.<ref name=\":4\" /> Ta\u2019weel became the hallmark of Isma\u2019ili thought and literature.

Mansur al-Yemen in the mid 4th century AH/10th century AD.\n\n\"The Qur\u2019an begins with [[Basmala|bismillaah al-rahmaan al-raheem]] (\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u06cc\u0645); bismillaah is composed of seven letters.  twelve letters emerges from this and that are al-rahmaan al-raheem.  This verse is the beginning of the first chapter of Qur\u2019an surat ul-hamd which has total seven verses.  The seven letters, which are the bismillaah, signify the seven naatiq. The twelve letters that arise from these signify that for each naatiq there are twelve naqeebs or hujjats.<ref>A high rank person in the spiritual hierarchy of divine mission-da\u2019wah of Fatimid Imams and they were twelve in number each in charge of a separate da\u2019wah region called jazeerah (pl. jazaa\u2019ir)</ref>  Thus the twelve letters, which are al-rahmaan al-raheem, that arise from the seven lettered bismillaah, together become nineteen letters.  This signifies that from the naatiqs \u2013 after each naatiq \u2013 seven imaams and twelve hujjats arise, which makes nineteen.  The same is the case with pillars of Islam, in which there are seven pillars each having twelve traditions.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Apocalyptic History of the Early Fatimid Empire|last=Velji|first=Jamel A.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780748690886|location=Edinburgh|pages=62}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Zaahir-Exoteric\n!Baatin-Esoteric\n|-\n|Islam\n|Faith\n|-\n|Skies\n|Prophets\n|-\n|Qur'an \n|Household of Prophet Mohammad\n|-\n|Earth\n|Ali bin Abi Taalib\n|-\n|Temporal world\n|Spiritual world\n|-\n|Body      \n|Soul\n|-\n|Prayer\n|Spiritual Mission\n|-\n|Ka\u2019bah  \n|The Imam of the time\n|-\n|Water\n|Knowledge\n|-\n|Oath of Allegiance \n|The right path\n|-\n|Honeybee\n|Believer\n|-\n|Salt \n|Wisdom\n|-\n|Fruits\n|The Imams from the progeny of Prophets\n|}\n\n== Library ==\nPersonal Alavi Library<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Isma\u2019ilis: Their History and Doctrines|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|publisher=Cambridge University Press and IIS|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-61636-2|location=UK|pages=241}}</ref> housed in the Residence of Saiyedna saheb<ref>He is the Supreme Authority as a Da'i ul Mutlaq of Alavi Bohras during the seclusion of 21st Fatemi Imam Maulaana Abul Qasim at-Taiyeb</ref> is the centre of Isma'ili Studies with the special reference to Taiyebi Branch of Literature.  There are various Academic and Research Institutions which carry out studies on Isma'ili Taiyebi Literature basically starting from 225 AH till date based on [[Hadith|Ahaadees]],<ref>Actions, Sayings and Traditions of Mohammad al-Mustafaa, the last Prophet of Islam described in various pieces of Islamic Literature</ref> Akaaleem,<ref>Supplications, Wise Sayings and Traditions of Maulaana Ali al-Murtazaa, the Vicegerent of  Mohammad</ref> Riwaayaat<ref>Quotes, Events, Miraculous Descriptions, Sayings, Esoteric Meanings explained by the Imam or Da'i, from the progeny of Mohammad</ref> and historic events with the assistance of renowned and experienced scholars in their respective fields.  Specifically the study of Isma'ili Literature is a part and parcel of the studies of Near-Eastern Languages and Culture.  Generally every University that carries out these studies also includes the study of [[Arabic|Arabic Language]] which is harboured by Isma'ili scholars.  These specific, selective and special studies are centered in a very few Institutions which houses Isma'ili Taiyebi [[Manuscript]]s (MSS) found in Arabic.\n\nDuring the second half of 20th century AD and in the recent years the scholarly, critical and significant research work is being carried out in European, American and Middle-Eastern Universities.  But it always requires a second thought and important inputs based in Isma\u2019ili dogmas from the authoritative seat of Da\u2019wat.  Scholars who are not at all in the system of Isma\u2019ili Faith lacks that special touch while dealing or summarizing or translating texts of Core Beliefs.  It is because these Isma\u2019ili literary gems<ref>Books based on beliefs, customs, traditions, jurisprudence, justice, dialogue, history etc</ref> had been written by Du\u2019aat in presence of an Imam or by his commands.  It contains an Oath<ref name=\":16\">Bay'at-Pact of Promise taken from a reader that he will read, understand, copy and convey the text written by the author with its true spirit and pure meaning and will only study this book by the authority appointed by Imam or Da'i</ref> for the Imam on which its reader must have to follow and without one is not supposed to even open a book.\n\nAs these books which were guarded into the private possessions made its way to Scholars and Researchers, the central point of Oath was mindlessly neglected and anyone who had an access to these books started their work.  No doubt great efforts and hard work have been carried out by the researchers but still there remains always a dot of doubt.  The Institutions which possess rich and periodically diversified Isma\u2019ili manuscripts has now become epicenter of scholarly activities and academic journalism.  The centre of ad-Da\u2019wat ul-Haadiyat ul-\u2018Alaviyah<ref>The Spiritual Seat, Divine Mission and Heavenly Call of Da'i of Alavi Bohras linked to the first Prophet of Islam and the First Creation of Allaah</ref> houses several hundred manuscripts which is managed, preserved, conserved and enriched by the 45th [[Haatim Zakiyuddin|Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq Saiyedna saheb]].  This personal library contains some of the rare Islamic and Isma\u2019ili titles and with every passing day newer titles are added.\n\nThis collection is in direct access, supervision and control of Da\u2019i al-Mutlaq and therefore the nature and process of addition to the collection is also noteworthy and the fact that Da\u2019i being the sole authority of Isma\u2019ili-Taiyebi learning is cognizant of the contents of each and every MSS, old as well as recent ones.  It has been observed that due to the maintenance of secrecy of Isma\u2019ili Literature, the private family collections in Yemen, Sindh and Hind<ref>The three Jazirah-Islands controlled by Da'i al-Mutlaq after the Satr-concealment of the Imam of Progeny of Mohammad Rasoolullaah, the last messenger of Islam</ref> are never in direct access to the public domain nor the MSS were lent or shared to any aspirant of the study.   But the ad-Da\u2019wat ul-Haadiyat ul-\u2018Alaviyah collection despite its original and unique source, the Da\u2019i is lenient in sharing the MSS after thoroughly assessing the just and critical way of translating, editing and publishing.  Though the centre of \u2018Alavi Da\u2019wat do not directly invite scholars or researchers from foreign universities, but time and again many interested foreign scholars have come straightforwardly and studied Isma\u2019ili titles with the Da\u2019i himself from Iran, UK, US and Europe.\n\nAt times, when the scholars who worked for the critical study and edition of any Isma\u2019ili title they might be having only 2\u20133 MSS from different origins, i.e. where writer, place and period differ, there arose the demand for the consultation of more MSS. For this purpose, the MSS of \u2018Alavi Da\u2019wat collection because of its Indian origin, proved more fruitful for better text reading and editing.  The other salient feature of \u2018Alavi Library is that it is housed at the Da\u2019is residence and most of the MSS are copied by the Du\u2019aat from those which were brought to Vadodara when the Da\u2019wat headquarters were shifted from Ahmedabad.\n\nIt has been well-preserved and well-maintained by the Da\u2019i's great efforts. Like many other places where such MSS and bundled for centuries and remain in lock-and-key and are never referred or studies, the case is entirely different here. Here at \u2018Alavi Library, Da\u2019i consults and refers these MSS and accordingly copies its texts in individual papers for lecture purpose and hand over certain old MSS to his close aides to make its fresh copy by penning the entire text.  With age-old methods the preservation of the MSS is carried out. As Da\u2019i personally handles all the library affairs, the question of precaution, curing or fumigation never arises.  But the Du\u2019aat felt it compulsory to make a copy of every MSS as there was a constant fear of a single copy might get damaged by any unexpected accident or worm attack.  Every year more and more MSS are added to the collection and also they are copied as and when required.\n\nThe MSS copied by 45th Da'i al-Mutlaq Saiyedna Haatim Zakiyuddin saheb since 1405 AH/1985

The six dimensions or '''\"M-\u0645\"''' of the Alavi Society in place of above mentioned things are:\n\n1.     [[Madrasa]]h (\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u06c3) \u2013 religious seminary: It stands for the teaching of the holy Book where children learn the basics of their community.  It is the beginning of their involvement in the social development and relations.  The first heavenly order that the [[Muhammad|Prophet Mohammad]] received at [[Jabal al-Nour|Mount Noor]] under the Hira cave<ref>A cave on Mount Noor-Jabal un Noor in Mecca where Prophet Mohammad prayed and received the first verses of Qur'an when he was 40 years of age</ref> was \"to read\".  So it became necessary for every believer to acquire knowledge throughout his lifetime from the designated person and the representative of Prophet Mohammad from his progeny.  So, Madrasah is not only meant for children but it is the learning hub for those who are keen in knowing the realities of creation.  Prophetic traditions says, \"Seditions appear and crush believers-your only salvation is your learning.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> Social health based on the overall knowledge is served by this \"M\" of Madrasah.  The importance of reading which is the stepping stone of any learning institution could be well found in the foremost Qur\u2019anic verses, \"READ in the name of your Lord who created.  Created man from an embryo. Read, for your Lord is most beneficent.  Who taught by the pen.  Taught man what he did not know.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.ahmedali/96:1|title=Tanzil \u2013 Quran Navigator {{!}} \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645|last=|first=|date=|website=tanzil.net|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>(al-Quran 96-1)\n\n2.   [[Oath of allegiance|Misaaq]] (\u0645\u06cc\u062b\u0627\u0642) \u2013 covenant: After completing basic religious and social learning, a learner or an ordinary Alavi initiate steps into puberty and towards intellectual advancement.  Now in order to become a member of a community and begin his spiritual journey with an [[Imam]], he has to give unconditional and lifetime oath of fealty or the promise for loyalty to the Imam's representative i.e. [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]]. This divine tradition and sublime submission was initiated from heavens and will be continued till the last day of this creation.  The Prophets took this oath from their respective people of their time and they commanded their missionaries to do so in order to protect their faith.  The initiate is also bound by this oath to keep secret the [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric knowledge]] imparted to him by a hierarchy of teachers authorized by the Isma'ili Imam.<ref name=\":9\" />  He has to renew this oath to Imam every year on 18th Zul Hijjah known as [[Rabigh|Eid e Ghadeer e Khumm]]-\u0639\u06cc\u062f \u063a\u062f\u06cc\u0631 \u062e\u0645.  \n[[File:Majlis in a mosque.jpg|alt=majlis e husaini during Moharram|thumb|An assembly-majlis in a mosque during [[Muharram|Moharram]] where [[Da'i al-Mutlaq|Da'i]] delivers an extensive lecture with the mourning on [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Husain]]]]\nOnce the believer had solemnly bound himself through the oath, he could undergo a step-by-step introduction into 'wisdom'-not all at once, for that would exceed his mental capacity.  'You are being put to a test,' the Da'i would say to his disciples, 'For you are beginners, and a beginner is like an infant: you should start first with milk and only later nourish yourselves with food.'<ref name=\":18\" />  This \"M\" of Misaaq induces religious responsibility into faithful's life and it helps to bring maturity for social well-being. For this Qur\u2019an says that, \"When We made the covenant with the Prophets, and with you (O Mohammad), as with Noah and Abraham, Moses and Jesus son of Mary, a binding covenant,  (It was) so that Allah may ask the truthful of their sincerity.

[[Mosque|Masjid]] (\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f) \u2013 mosque:  After offering covenant to Da\u2019i, the head of the community, An Alavi tries his level best to fulfill all its obligations and this begins at the very doorstep of a mosque. The centrality of the mosque is inevitable for a believer.  Each and every socio-religious activity revolves around it.  Prophetic traditions says, \"The mosque is where the pious live.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> A believer goes three times daily to offer [[Salah|prayers]]. There he is educated and informed about different social programs and being a part of a community how he should serve his fellow members and actively participate in the social and welfare activities.  This '''\"M-\u0645\"''' of Masjid-Mosque proves to be a perfect training centre for creating responsibility, positivity, respect and thoughtfulness among people.  Being a learned and authoritative person, a Da'i in his capacity trains his followers in maintaining social etiquettes and ethos by imparting necessary knowledge in his sermons.  Da'i is the soul of the mosque and with his prostration, people in the mosque prostrates in front of Allah.  The Qur\u2019an says about a mosque which is the best place for worship, that \"O sons of Adam, attire yourselves at every time of worship; eat and drink, but do not be wasteful, for Allah does not like the prodigals.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.ahmedali/7:31|title=Tanzil \u2013 Quran Navigator {{!}} \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0645|last=|first=|date=|website=tanzil.net|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>(al-Quran 7\u201331)\n\n4.   [[Mazar (mausoleum)|Mazaar]] (\u0645\u0632\u0627\u0631) \u2013 mausoleum:  It is an important place for a believer that is filled with spirituality and devotion. A holy person having special designation conferred by an Imam in the spiritual hierarchy is buried here. After offering prayers in a mosque people come to pay respect to the mausoleum and take [[Tawassul|waseelah]]-intercession while doing supplication to fulfill their wishes in front of Allah.  Usually mausoleum or tomb of a Da'i or a religious authority is situated besides the mosque.  It plays a key role in social bonding as each and every community member visit it daily or weekly or when he wishes.  If anyone visits a Rawzah-mausoleum of a particular Da'i then it is said that, he took blessings of all those people who were in the covenant of that Da'i. Mazaar of a Da'i is also called \"Rawzah\" as it is like a paradise and one can feel its fervor and freshness by spiritually attaching himself to Da'i.  Every believer is a martyr-Shahid and the mausoleum of a Da'i is the master of all martyrs who were from his believers.  Visiting mausoleum is like going to the entrance and gate of paradise. If one has learned Qur\u2019anic recitation in Madrasah, gave Misaaq to his Da'i and has an habit of coming to a mosque for prayers, then surely he will visit Mazaar.\n\nIn this account, Imam [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Ja'far as-Saadiq]] addresses Kufan people and encourages them to visit the tomb of [[Husayn ibn Ali|al-Husayn b. 'Ali]]: 'If one of you performs the hajj in the course of your lifetime and does not visit the grave of al-Husayn, then you have departed from one of the duties and rights of Allah and His messenger.

Majlis (\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633) \u2013 religious gathering:  an assembly or a special private audience accompanied with prayer where a discourse of a Da'i is held is generally termed as majlis.  It begins with the praise and elegy relating to the [[Ahl al-Bayt|household of Prophet Mohammad]] or a religious dignitary associated with them. Prophetic traditions says, \"The most commodious assembly is best.\"<ref name=\":6\" />  The main majlis is held during the first 10 days of [[Mohurram|Moharram]] in the commemoration of the martyrdom of the grandson of Prophet Mohammad, [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Husain]].  Throughout the year different types of majlis are held during the inauguration of any place, oath of fealty, marriage, birthday, sehra, ziyaarat, weekly lectures, madrasah or mausoleum.  As per the occasion and time, every member of the community more or less participates in these majlis.  It accounts to be a crucial cord of social harmony and awakening as one who attends it comes to know his roots, history, tenets, good-evil aspects of life, relations with others and social customs.  \n[[File:Thaal or maaedah and the people taking dinner in it.jpg|thumb|A \"Thaal\"<ref>A big round platter in which food is served in a single plate or bowl is kept from where everyone sitting in a thaal takes their share and in turns</ref> in which people sit together with legs folded to eat and it is kept on the floor]]\nUnder the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]], these type of private lectures or teaching sessions were organized for different categories of participants in [[Cairo]], including the initiates, courtiers, high officials, women and royal women.<ref name=\":9\" /> During the reign of Fatimid Caliph [[Al-Mustansir Billah|Imam al-Mustansir Billah]], his Da'i [[Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi|al-Mu'ayyad]] leaves nothing to be desired in the field of knowledge and rhetorical skill through conducting various ''majlis''.

There is no restriction for females as far as education, job and business is concerned, as the same is not the case in other societies and cultures. Females are given the same status and freedom as the males of the communities, but the things should be done under the Islamic practices and social framework.  There are many initiatives carried out for the overall progress and development of the skills pertaining to ladies. In terms of eating habits, Alavi Bohras like each and every type of food and being a Gujarati say, \"yes\" to everything lawful and healthy.

Unfortunately, during the trip, Fred and Barney accidentally stumble across Rockula's old laboratory, where his unfinished Frankenstone monster sleeps, and forget to close the window when they leave the lab. Lightning subsequently strikes the machines in the lab, and provide Frankenstone with life. Frankenstone awakens Rockula (who has been asleep for the past five hundred years, thus explaining his disappearance) from his secret crypt, and the two scare everyone out of the hotel, except for the Flintstones and the Rubbles, who had gone to bed early due to jet lag.\n\nRockula and Frankenstone eventually discover the Flintstones and Rubbles, and Rockula mistakes Wilma for his long-lost bride and vows to make her his, even if it means killing Fred. Wilma initially mistakes Rockula for the hotel manager, Mr. Silika, who had dressed up as Rockula, for quite some time until Rockula turns into a bat in front of her. As Fred, Barney and Betty discover Wilma's absence and begin searching for her, Wilma flees and a long cat-and-mouse chase ensues all over the castle. Rockula finds and corners Fred, but is scared off by Barney, wearing a werewolf mask. The couples eventually end up cornered inside the Rubbles' room. Fred challenges Rockula to a fight, using a bat statuette as a weapon, but the statuette turns out to actually be the switch for the trapdoor to Rockula's laboratory, which Rockula and Frankenstone were unknowingly standing on. As Fred raises the statuette to strike, both Rockula and Frankenstone fall through the trapdoor, and the Flintstones and Rubbles escape and return to Bedrock. Wilma invites Betty and Barney to stay for dinner and leaves the three of them in the living room while she goes into the kitchen to cook.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Rockula has flown (in the form of a bat) all the way from Rocksylvania to Bedrock. Flying through the kitchen window, he begs Wilma to marry him, promising her a life of luxury if she agrees. Winking at Fred, Barney and Betty (watching surreptitiously from the doorway), Wilma agrees to consider marrying Rockula, then immediately begins nagging him about chores, upkeep of the house, and his bad habits. Aghast, Rockula (apparently forgetting that most chores would be left to the servants) changes back into a bat and flies off, claiming to need another 500 years of rest. Barney laughs and lauds Wilma for defeating Rockula by telling him \"the real truth about married life\".\n\n==Rockula and Frankenstone==\n*'''Count Rockula''': a campy and not-so-bloodthirsty vampire with a lust for women and a fear of werewolves, prompting him to build a Frankenstone monster to keep them away. Having been asleep for five hundred years, Rockula is awoken by Frankenstone and sets out to clear his castle of the guests and take Wilma, whom he thinks is his bride, for himself, even if it means killing Fred. Count Rockula also appears in the episodes \"Blood Brothers\" and \"Fred and Barney Meet the Frankenstones\" of ''The New Fred and Barney Show'', again voiced by Stephenson, albeit in a completely different continuity because Rockula then has a bride, slightly different garments, and a pet werewolf despite having a fear for them in this movie.\n*'''Frankenstone''': Count Rockula's unfinished creation, awoken prematurely when lightning strikes the machinery in Rockula's lab. His only mission in life is to carry out Rockula's orders, primarily to keep werewolves away from Rockula, although his low IQ often leads him to find difficulty in accomplishing even the simplest of tasks (in one particular scene, Frankenstone is ordered to search some barrels for Fred, and fails to notice Fred crouching right beside him). Despite the resemblance, he is not to be confused with the Frank Frankenstone character that first appeared in the episode \"Fred & Barney Meet the Frankenstones\" of ''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'', the TV special ''[[The Flintstones' New Neighbors]]'' or ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980)|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''. Frankenstone was one of Ted Cassidy's final roles; the actor, who was already famous for playing Frankenstein's monster-like roles due to his height (most notably [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]] on ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' and several other productions), died ten months before the special was released.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Henry Corden]] - Fred Flintstone\n* [[Mel Blanc]] - Barney Rubble; Dino\n* [[Jean Vander Pyl]] - Wilma Flintstone; Frau G.

Unfortunately, during the trip, Fred and Barney accidentally stumble across Rockula's old laboratory, where his unfinished Frankenstone monster sleeps, and forget to close the window when they leave the lab. Lightning subsequently strikes the machines in the lab, and provide Frankenstone with life. Frankenstone awakens Rockula (who has been asleep for the past five hundred years, thus explaining his disappearance) from his secret crypt, and the two scare everyone out of the hotel, except for the Flintstones and the Rubbles, who had gone to bed early due to jet lag.\n\nRockula and Frankenstone eventually discover the Flintstones and Rubbles, and Rockula mistakes Wilma for his long-lost bride and vows to make her his, even if it means killing Fred. Wilma initially mistakes Rockula for the hotel manager, Mr. Silika, who had dressed up as Rockula, for quite some time until Rockula turns into a bat in front of her. As Fred, Barney and Betty discover Wilma's absence and begin searching for her, Wilma flees and a long cat-and-mouse chase ensues all over the castle. Rockula finds and corners Fred, but is scared off by Barney, wearing a werewolf mask. The couples eventually end up cornered inside the Rubbles' room. Fred challenges Rockula to a fight, using a bat statuette as a weapon, but the statuette turns out to actually be the switch for the trapdoor to Rockula's laboratory, which Rockula and Frankenstone were unknowingly standing on. As Fred raises the statuette to strike, both Rockula and Frankenstone fall through the trapdoor, and the Flintstones and Rubbles escape and return to Bedrock. Wilma invites Betty and Barney to stay for dinner and leaves the three of them in the living room while she goes into the kitchen to cook.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Rockula has flown (in the form of a bat) all the way from Rocksylvania to Bedrock. Flying through the kitchen window, he begs Wilma to marry him, promising her a life of luxury if she agrees. Winking at Fred, Barney and Betty (watching surreptitiously from the doorway), Wilma agrees to consider marrying Rockula, then immediately begins nagging him about chores, upkeep of the house, and his bad habits. Aghast, Rockula (apparently forgetting that most chores would be left to the servants) changes back into a bat and flies off, claiming to need another 500 years of rest. Barney laughs and lauds Wilma for defeating Rockula by telling him \"the real truth about married life\".\n\n==Rockula and Frankenstone==\n*'''Count Rockula''': a campy and not-so-bloodthirsty vampire with a lust for women and a fear of werewolves, prompting him to build a Frankenstone monster to keep them away. Having been asleep for five hundred years, Rockula is awoken by Frankenstone and sets out to clear his castle of the guests and take Wilma, whom he thinks is his bride, for himself, even if it means killing Fred. Count Rockula also appears in the episodes \"Blood Brothers\" and \"Fred and Barney Meet the Frankenstones\" of ''The New Fred and Barney Show'', again voiced by Stephenson, albeit in a completely different continuity because Rockula then has a bride, slightly different garments, and a pet werewolf despite having a fear for them in this movie.\n*'''Frankenstone''': Count Rockula's unfinished creation, awoken prematurely when lightning strikes the machinery in Rockula's lab. His only mission in life is to carry out Rockula's orders, primarily to keep werewolves away from Rockula, although his low IQ often leads him to find difficulty in accomplishing even the simplest of tasks (in one particular scene, Frankenstone is ordered to search some barrels for Fred, and fails to notice Fred crouching right beside him). Despite the resemblance, he is not to be confused with the Frank Frankenstone character that first appeared in the episode \"Fred and Barney Meet the Frankenstones\" of ''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'', the TV special ''[[The Flintstones' New Neighbors]]'' or ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980)|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''. Frankenstone was one of Ted Cassidy's final roles; the actor, who was already famous for playing Frankenstein's monster-like roles due to his height (most notably [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]] on ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' and several other productions), died ten months before the special was released.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Henry Corden]] - Fred Flintstone\n* [[Mel Blanc]] - Barney Rubble; Dino\n* [[Jean Vander Pyl]] - Wilma Flintstone; Frau G.

Originally a goal-kicking [[Rugby league positions#Scrum-half|half-back]], in his career he played for and captained the [[Penrith Panthers]] and the [[Auckland Warriors]] clubs and also represented his country and state on several occasions. Alexander's position for the majority of his career was at [[Rugby league positions#Scrum-half|half-back]], however early in his career \u2013 particularly in representative sides \u2013 he was moved to {{rlp|fb}}. It was this ability to play different positions with great success that saw Alexander make both the [[1986 Kangaroo Tour|1986]] and the [[1990 Kangaroo Tour|1990]] [[Kangaroo Tour]]s.\n\nAlexander actually played a test on the 1990 Tour against [[France national rugby league team|France]] on the {{rlp|wg}}, scoring a try and capping it off with a memorable gymnastics style backflip in celebration.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxEyfy03nWc 1990 Kangaroo tour - French leg highlights]</ref> This was also his last test appearance.\n\n==Junior career==\nAlexander began his career at schoolboy level where he quickly established himself as a star player for his side. He attended [[Patrician Brothers' College, Fairfield]] he played for the [[Australian Schoolboys rugby league team]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|title=SportingPulse Homepage for Australian Secondary Schools Rugby League|url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=7-2130-0-0-0&sID=26424|accessdate=2008-10-10| publisher=SportingPulse}}</ref> He was later signed on as a junior to his local club side the [[Penrith Panthers]].\n\n==Professional career==\n===Penrith Panthers===\nAlexander made his first grade debut for the Panthers in the [[1984 NSWRL season|1984 season]] as a half-back. His talent quickly became clear and by the end of the season he took out the Rookie of the Year award. The following year Greg continued his good form throughout the season tallying up 194 points (a club record at the time) and earning himself the 1985 [[Dally M. Awards|Dally M.]] player of the year award. Greg continued playing with the Panthers for the next several years and become known for his unique ability to score and set up tries, his excellent attacking kicking and his solid defence.\n\nAt the end of the [[1986 NSWRL season]], he went on the [[1986 Kangaroo tour]], gaining selection after [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] winger [[Eric Grothe, Sr.|Eric Grothe]] was controversially ruled out with a knee injury. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Alexander would go on to play in 10 matches on tour with the Kangaroos, scoring 10 tries and kicking 5 goals. Alexander and test hooker [[Royce Simmons]] became the first Panthers selected for a [[Kangaroo Tour]]. 1989 saw him rise to selection for New South Wales in the [[1989 State of Origin series]], being one of the few Blues players regarded as playing well in a series won 3-0 by [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]], before being selected as the first choice halfback for Australia's mid-season tour of New Zealand. After making his test debut in the 26-6 first test win against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] at the [[Queen Elizabeth II Park]] in [[Christchurch]], and playing in the 8-0 second test win at [[Rotorua International Stadium|Rotorua]], Alexander lost his place in the side with coach [[Bob Fulton]] preferring his [[1987 NSWRL season#Grand Final|1987 premiership]] winning halfback from [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]], [[Des Hasler]], in the position for the third and final test.\n\nDuring the [[1989 NSWRL season]], his pace and skill had made Penrith the second most dangerous attacking team in the competition behind the eventual premiers, the [[Canberra Raiders]] and Alexander was the Panthers leading try and point scorer and for much of the year led the league in try scoring \u2013 scoring ten tries in eight games at one point, eventually finishing with 15 tries from 18 games for the season.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nswrl-1989/penrith/summary.html 1989 Penrith Panthers at Rugby League Project]</ref> Alexander would eventually finish second on the try scoring list finishing behind Canberra fullback [[Gary Belcher]] who scored 17 tries. Alexander finished ahead of other noted try scorers including [[Andrew Ettingshausen]] ([[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks|Cronulla]]), [[Ricky Walford]] ([[St George Dragons|St George]]) and [[Phil Blake]] ([[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]]).<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nswrl-1989/summary.html 1989 NSWRL season at Rugby League Project]</ref> Penrith's form saw them reach the finals for the first time since his rookie year in 1984, reaching the knockout Minor Semi-Final before ending their season with a 27\u201318 loss to Canberra.\n\nWith Alexander in great form at both halfback and fullback for the Panthers, the club made it to their first ever [[1990 NSWRL season#Grand Final|Grand Final]] in 1990 against the defending premiers Canberra. The Panthers went down 18\u201314 to the Raiders and despite a solid performance, Alexander's goal kicking let him down on the day, only kicking one of his four attempts compared to Canberra captain [[Mal Meninga]] who landed all three of his attempts. Despite his good form, Alexander was only selected to the bench for game 3 of the [[1990 State of Origin series]] and missed selection in Australia's mid-season tests against [[France national rugby league team|France]] and New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/state-of-origin-1990/summary.html 1990 State of Origin at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\nAt the end of the season he was selected for his second [[1990 Kangaroo tour|Kangaroo Tour]] as the back up fullback to Canberra and Queensland custodian [[Gary Belcher]] and went on to be selected for every game on tour, although unlike [[Terry Lamb]] who played in every game on the 1986 tour, Alexander, along with the Kangaroo's other replacements that day ([[David Gillespie]], Des Hasler and [[Mark Sargent]]), did not get off the bench in the 14\u201310 second test win against [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] at [[Old Trafford]] that kept [[The Ashes (rugby league)|The Ashes]] series alive. He also failed to get off the bench in the third game of the tour against [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]. Alexander was the leading point scorer for the Kangaroos on tour, playing 17 games (4 tests but selected for all 5 tests), scoring 14 tries and kicking 50 goals for a total of 156 points. The closest a teammate got in points was team captain Mal Meninga who scored 64 points (8 tries, 16 goals) from his 11 games. He scored a record 46 points in the tour match against France B (5 tries, 13 goals) in [[Lyon]] and continued that form into the first test against France 3 days later in [[Avignon]] when after coming on to replace an ill [[Ricky Stuart]] at halfback early in the game he went on to score 3 tries and kick 7/8 goals in the Kangaroos 60\u20134 win giving him a personal haul of 28 points.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/france-vs-australia-1990/france-vs-australia.html 1990 Kangaroo tour - France vs Australia 1st Test]</ref><ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/kangaroos-tour-1990/game-15/france-xiii-vs-australia.html 1990 Kangaroo tour - France B vs Australia]</ref>\n\nIn the 34\u201310 second test win a week later at the [[Stade Gilbert Brutus]] in [[Perpignan]], a [[hamstring]] injury ruled out [[Laurie Daley]]. This saw [[Dale Shearer]] move from the wing to the centres and Brandy was selected on the wing where he kicked 3 goals to go along with his memorable try which resulted in his gymnastics style backflip celebration. He had performed the backflip several times at training while in England (claiming it was something he had learned in gymnastics while still in school) and had wanted to do it after scoring a try in a game, but with Australia in a battle to retain The Ashes he felt the circumstances were never right. However, as the second test against the French was also the final game of the Kangaroo tour, he allowed himself the luxury of the backflip in front of the TV camera's.<ref name=\"Greg Alexander One On One Interview - Sterlo\">{{cite web |url=https://wn.com/greg_alexander_one_on_one_interview_%7C_sterlo |title=Greg Alexander One On One Interview - Sterlo|publisher=Fox Sports|date=9 December 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlexander captained the Panthers to their maiden premiership in [[1991 NSWRL season|1991]], the Panthers reversing the result of the 1990 Grand Final with a 19\u201312 win over Canberra. From halfback, Alexander took control of the game in the 2nd half with his kicking game which included a 38-metre field goal to give Penrith a 13\u201312 lead following a [[Brad Izzard]] try under the posts which was converted by Alexander. Later a majestic sideline conversion of [[Royce Simmons]]' 2nd try of the game sealed the win for the Panthers. The [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] coached Panthers never fell below 4th on the ladder for the season (Round 2) and never lost the competition lead after regaining it following Round 14 of the 22 round season. From Round 14 the Panthers only loss of the season was a 14\u201312 away loss to Cronulla-Sutherland in Round 20.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nswrl-1991/penrith/summary.html 1990 Penrith Panthers at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\nDuring the season he was selected at fullback for NSW in Games I and III of the [[1991 State of Origin series]], only missing Game II at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] through injury. Despite his good form for Penrith and NSW and the absence of Gary Belcher through injury, Alexander was overlooked for the first test of mid-season [[1991 Trans-Tasman Test series|Trans-Tasman Test series]] against New Zealand in favour of boom [[Brisbane Broncos|Brisbane]] and Qld fullback [[Paul Hauff]], while he also missed selection in the final two games when selectors chose [[Andrew Ettingshausen]]. With Origin halfbacks [[Ricky Stuart]] and [[Allan Langer]] also in good form (Langer played) and Des Hasler in the team as a utility reserve, Alexander was only considered a chance of playing fullback in the tests. Following the Panthers Grand Final win over Canberra, Alexander was selected for Australia's 5 game tour to Papua New Guinea but withdrew through injury. He recovered from injury in time to lead the Panthers to England in October for the [[1991 World Club Challenge]], which was lost to Wigan 21\u20134 at the [[Anfield]] Stadium.\n\n1992 was a year of huge expectation for Alexander and the reigning premiers Penrith. Whilst the Panthers form was up and down at the beginning of the season, Alexander was named as captain and fullback of the [[City Origin]] side, ahead of incumbent NSW captain [[Benny Elias]]. This led to Alexander being the favourite to take over the Blues captaincy for that year's [[1992 State of Origin series|State of Origin series]] against Queensland. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} However, a knee injury lead to Alexander being withdrawn from the match, and [[Country Origin]] captain [[Laurie Daley]] would go on to successfully captain the NSW side to a 2\u20131 series win, with Alexander missing all three games due to his knee injury. Selectors stuck with Stuart at half and Ettingshausen at the back.\n\n====Ben Alexander's death====\nOn 21 June 1992, his younger brother and fellow Panthers teammate [[Ben Alexander (rugby league)|Ben Alexander]] was killed in a car accident.<ref name=\"rugbyheaven.smh.com.au\">{{cite news|agency=Australian Associated Press|date=29 January 2006|url=http://www.rugbyheaven.smh.com.au/articles/2006/01/28/1138319487065.html|title=Mourning Mat's biggest battle|work=Sydney Morning Herald|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203182648/http://www.rugbyheaven.smh.com.au/articles/2006/01/28/1138319487065.html|archivedate=3 February 2006}}</ref> The tragic loss of the younger Alexander had an adverse effect on the close-knit Panthers club and the team's form dropped off in the second half of the year which saw them miss the finals. Greg Alexander missed the majority of fixtures that year, playing only 9 games for the season (including two from the bench) and following his brother's death would not return to the side until their Round 20 match against Manly-Warringah at [[Brookvale Oval]] in August. After his return he continually fell below his usual playing weight of 84&nbsp;kg and ended the season ten kilograms lighter than usual.<ref name=\"rugbyheaven.smh.com.au\"/>\n\n===Auckland Warriors===\nAt the end of the [[1994 NSWRL season|1994 season]] after playing in just 13 games for the Panthers (mostly at fullback as the club had signed New Zealand test halfback [[Gary Freeman (rugby league)|Gary Freeman]] from [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]]), Alexander, seeking a change and to just get away from Sydney following the death of his brother Ben in 1992, joined the [[Auckland Warriors]], one of four new teams introduced for the [[1995 ARL season|1995 season]]. He spent most of the first half of his first season for the Warriors at halfback, and began to recapture some of his previous form. In the latter half of the season he moved between fullback, halfback and five-eighth due the depth the Warriors had in the halves - with [[Gene Ngamu]], [[Stacey Jones]], [[Phil Blake]] and [[Frano Botica]] all spending some time at halfback or five-eighth. In his second season with the club, he was awarded the captaincy after [[Dean Bell]] retired, and again began the season at halfback. However, after he was injured in Round 10, New Zealand halfback [[Stacey Jones]] regained the half back role, and upon returning to the side Alexander was moved to the fullback position - where he would remain for most of the remaining season.\n\n===Return to the Panthers===\nAlexander eventually returned to Penrith in 1997 after his stint in New Zealand and stayed on until his retirement in 1999. His early season form for the Panthers in the new [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|Super League]] competition saw him selected at halfback for his first game for NSW since 1991 in the [[Super League Tri-series]]. After starring in NSW's 38-10 win over Queensland in the first game of the series.\n\nIn total, Alexander played 228 games for the Panthers, scored 100 tries, kicked 343 goals and 14 field goals, tallying 1,100 career points for the club. To date, he is one of only seven players ever score over 100 tries and over 1,000 points for a single club in top grade Australian rugby league. The others being [[Terry Lamb]] ([[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]]), [[Ryan Girdler]] ([[Penrith Panthers]]), [[Hazem El Masri]] ([[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]]), [[Darren Lockyer]] ([[Brisbane Broncos]]), [[Luke Burt]] ([[Parramatta Eels]]) and [[Jarrod Croker]] ([[Canberra Raiders]]).\n\n==Life after football==\nAfter his retirement from football in 1999, Alexander embarked on a media career in both radio and television.

Originally a goal-kicking [[Rugby league positions#Scrum-half|half-back]], in his career he played for and captained the [[Penrith Panthers]] and the [[Auckland Warriors]] clubs and also represented his country and state on several occasions. Alexander's position for the majority of his career was at [[Rugby league positions#Scrum-half|half-back]], however early in his career \u2013 particularly in representative sides \u2013 he was moved to {{rlp|fb}}. It was this ability to play different positions with great success that saw Alexander make both the [[1986 Kangaroo Tour|1986]] and the [[1990 Kangaroo Tour|1990]] [[Kangaroo Tour]]s.\n\nAlexander actually played a test on the 1990 Tour against [[France national rugby league team|France]] on the {{rlp|wg}}, scoring a try and capping it off with a memorable gymnastics style backflip in celebration.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxEyfy03nWc 1990 Kangaroo tour - French leg highlights]</ref> This was also his last test appearance.\n\n==Junior career==\nAlexander began his career at schoolboy level where he quickly established himself as a star player for his side. He attended [[Patrician Brothers' College, Fairfield]] he played for the [[Australian Schoolboys rugby league team]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|title=SportingPulse Homepage for Australian Secondary Schools Rugby League|url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=7-2130-0-0-0&sID=26424|accessdate=2008-10-10| publisher=SportingPulse}}</ref> He was later signed on as a junior to his local club side the [[Penrith Panthers]].\n\n==Professional career==\n===Penrith Panthers===\nAlexander made his first grade debut for the Panthers in the [[1984 NSWRL season|1984 season]] as a half-back. His talent quickly became clear and by the end of the season he took out the Rookie of the Year award. The following year Greg continued his good form throughout the season tallying up 194 points (a club record at the time) and earning himself the 1985 [[Dally M. Awards|Dally M.]] player of the year award. Greg continued playing with the Panthers for the next several years and become known for his unique ability to score and set up tries, his excellent attacking kicking and his solid defence.\n\nAt the end of the [[1986 NSWRL season]], he went on the [[1986 Kangaroo tour]], gaining selection after [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] winger [[Eric Grothe, Sr.|Eric Grothe]] was controversially ruled out with a knee injury. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Alexander would go on to play in 10 matches on tour with the Kangaroos, scoring 10 tries and kicking 5 goals. Alexander and test hooker [[Royce Simmons]] became the first Panthers selected for a [[Kangaroo Tour]]. 1989 saw him rise to selection for New South Wales in the [[1989 State of Origin series]], being one of the few Blues players regarded as playing well in a series won 3-0 by [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]], before being selected as the first choice halfback for Australia's mid-season tour of New Zealand. After making his test debut in the 26-6 first test win against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] at the [[Queen Elizabeth II Park]] in [[Christchurch]], and playing in the 8-0 second test win at [[Rotorua International Stadium|Rotorua]], Alexander lost his place in the side with coach [[Bob Fulton]] preferring his [[1987 NSWRL season#Grand Final|1987 premiership]] winning halfback from [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]], [[Des Hasler]], in the position for the third and final test.\n\nDuring the [[1989 NSWRL season]], his pace and skill had made Penrith the second most dangerous attacking team in the competition behind the eventual premiers, the [[Canberra Raiders]] and Alexander was the Panthers leading try and point scorer and for much of the year led the league in try scoring \u2013 scoring ten tries in eight games at one point, eventually finishing with 15 tries from 18 games for the season.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nswrl-1989/penrith/summary.html 1989 Penrith Panthers at Rugby League Project]</ref> Alexander would eventually finish second on the try scoring list finishing behind Canberra fullback [[Gary Belcher]] who scored 17 tries. Alexander finished ahead of other noted try scorers including [[Andrew Ettingshausen]] ([[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks|Cronulla]]), [[Ricky Walford]] ([[St George Dragons|St George]]) and [[Phil Blake]] ([[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]]).<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nswrl-1989/summary.html 1989 NSWRL season at Rugby League Project]</ref> Penrith's form saw them reach the finals for the first time since his rookie year in 1984, reaching the knockout Minor Semi-Final before ending their season with a 27\u201318 loss to Canberra.\n\nWith Alexander in great form at both halfback and fullback for the Panthers, the club made it to their first ever [[1990 NSWRL season#Grand Final|Grand Final]] in 1990 against the defending premiers Canberra. The Panthers went down 18\u201314 to the Raiders and despite a solid performance, Alexander's goal kicking let him down on the day, only kicking one of his four attempts compared to Canberra captain [[Mal Meninga]] who landed all three of his attempts. Despite his good form, Alexander was only selected to the bench for game 3 of the [[1990 State of Origin series]] and missed selection in Australia's mid-season tests against [[France national rugby league team|France]] and New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/state-of-origin-1990/summary.html 1990 State of Origin at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\nAt the end of the season he was selected for his second [[1990 Kangaroo tour|Kangaroo Tour]] as the back up fullback to Canberra and Queensland custodian [[Gary Belcher]] and went on to be selected for every game on tour, although unlike [[Terry Lamb]] who played in every game on the 1986 tour, Alexander, along with the Kangaroo's other replacements that day ([[David Gillespie]], Des Hasler and [[Mark Sargent]]), did not get off the bench in the 14\u201310 second test win against [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] at [[Old Trafford]] that kept [[The Ashes (rugby league)|The Ashes]] series alive. He also failed to get off the bench in the third game of the tour against [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]. Alexander was the leading point scorer for the Kangaroos on tour, playing 17 games (4 tests but selected for all 5 tests), scoring 14 tries and kicking 50 goals for a total of 156 points. The closest a teammate got in points was team captain Mal Meninga who scored 64 points (8 tries, 16 goals) from his 11 games. He scored a record 46 points in the tour match against France B (5 tries, 13 goals) in [[Lyon]] and continued that form into the first test against France 3 days later in [[Avignon]] when after coming on to replace an ill [[Ricky Stuart]] at halfback early in the game he went on to score 3 tries and kick 7/8 goals in the Kangaroos 60\u20134 win giving him a personal haul of 28 points.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/france-vs-australia-1990/france-vs-australia.html 1990 Kangaroo tour - France vs Australia 1st Test]</ref><ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/kangaroos-tour-1990/game-15/france-xiii-vs-australia.html 1990 Kangaroo tour - France B vs Australia]</ref>\n\nIn the 34\u201310 second test win a week later at the [[Stade Gilbert Brutus]] in [[Perpignan]], a [[hamstring]] injury ruled out [[Laurie Daley]]. This saw [[Dale Shearer]] move from the wing to the centres and Brandy was selected on the wing where he kicked 3 goals to go along with his memorable try which resulted in his gymnastics style backflip celebration. He had performed the backflip several times at training while in England (claiming it was something he had learned in gymnastics while still in school) and had wanted to do it after scoring a try in a game, but with Australia in a battle to retain The Ashes he felt the circumstances were never right. However, as the second test against the French was also the final game of the Kangaroo tour, he allowed himself the luxury of the backflip in front of the TV camera's.<ref name=\"Greg Alexander One On One Interview - Sterlo\">{{cite web |url=https://wn.com/greg_alexander_one_on_one_interview_%7C_sterlo |title=Greg Alexander One On One Interview - Sterlo|publisher=Fox Sports|date=9 December 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlexander captained the Panthers to their maiden premiership in [[1991 NSWRL season|1991]], the Panthers reversing the result of the 1990 Grand Final with a 19\u201312 win over Canberra. From halfback, Alexander took control of the game in the 2nd half with his kicking game which included a 38-metre field goal to give Penrith a 13\u201312 lead following a [[Brad Izzard]] try under the posts which was converted by Alexander. Later a majestic sideline conversion of [[Royce Simmons]]' 2nd try of the game sealed the win for the Panthers. The [[Phil Gould]] coached Panthers never fell below 4th on the ladder for the season (Round 2) and never lost the competition lead after regaining it following Round 14 of the 22 round season. From Round 14 the Panthers only loss of the season was a 14\u201312 away loss to Cronulla-Sutherland in Round 20.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nswrl-1991/penrith/summary.html 1990 Penrith Panthers at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\nDuring the season he was selected at fullback for NSW in Games I and III of the [[1991 State of Origin series]], only missing Game II at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] through injury. Despite his good form for Penrith and NSW and the absence of Gary Belcher through injury, Alexander was overlooked for the first test of mid-season [[1991 Trans-Tasman Test series|Trans-Tasman Test series]] against New Zealand in favour of boom [[Brisbane Broncos|Brisbane]] and Qld fullback [[Paul Hauff]], while he also missed selection in the final two games when selectors chose [[Andrew Ettingshausen]]. With Origin halfbacks [[Ricky Stuart]] and [[Allan Langer]] also in good form (Langer played) and Des Hasler in the team as a utility reserve, Alexander was only considered a chance of playing fullback in the tests. Following the Panthers Grand Final win over Canberra, Alexander was selected for Australia's 5 game tour to Papua New Guinea but withdrew through injury. He recovered from injury in time to lead the Panthers to England in October for the [[1991 World Club Challenge]], which was lost to Wigan 21\u20134 at the [[Anfield]] Stadium.\n\n1992 was a year of huge expectation for Alexander and the reigning premiers Penrith. Whilst the Panthers form was up and down at the beginning of the season, Alexander was named as captain and fullback of the [[City Origin]] side, ahead of incumbent NSW captain [[Benny Elias]]. This led to Alexander being the favourite to take over the Blues captaincy for that year's [[1992 State of Origin series|State of Origin series]] against Queensland. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} However, a knee injury lead to Alexander being withdrawn from the match, and [[Country Origin]] captain [[Laurie Daley]] would go on to successfully captain the NSW side to a 2\u20131 series win, with Alexander missing all three games due to his knee injury. Selectors stuck with Stuart at half and Ettingshausen at the back.\n\n====Ben Alexander's death====\nOn 21 June 1992, his younger brother and fellow Panthers teammate [[Ben Alexander (rugby league)|Ben Alexander]] was killed in a car accident.<ref name=\"rugbyheaven.smh.com.au\">{{cite news|agency=Australian Associated Press|date=29 January 2006|url=http://www.rugbyheaven.smh.com.au/articles/2006/01/28/1138319487065.html|title=Mourning Mat's biggest battle|work=Sydney Morning Herald|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203182648/http://www.rugbyheaven.smh.com.au/articles/2006/01/28/1138319487065.html|archivedate=3 February 2006}}</ref> The tragic loss of the younger Alexander had an adverse effect on the close-knit Panthers club and the team's form dropped off in the second half of the year which saw them miss the finals. Greg Alexander missed the majority of fixtures that year, playing only 9 games for the season (including two from the bench) and following his brother's death would not return to the side until their Round 20 match against Manly-Warringah at [[Brookvale Oval]] in August. After his return he continually fell below his usual playing weight of 84&nbsp;kg and ended the season ten kilograms lighter than usual.<ref name=\"rugbyheaven.smh.com.au\"/>\n\n===Auckland Warriors===\nAt the end of the [[1994 NSWRL season|1994 season]] after playing in just 13 games for the Panthers (mostly at fullback as the club had signed New Zealand test halfback [[Gary Freeman (rugby league)|Gary Freeman]] from [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]]), Alexander, seeking a change and to just get away from Sydney following the death of his brother Ben in 1992, joined the [[Auckland Warriors]], one of four new teams introduced for the [[1995 ARL season|1995 season]]. He spent most of the first half of his first season for the Warriors at halfback, and began to recapture some of his previous form. In the latter half of the season he moved between fullback, halfback and five-eighth due the depth the Warriors had in the halves - with [[Gene Ngamu]], [[Stacey Jones]], [[Phil Blake]] and [[Frano Botica]] all spending some time at halfback or five-eighth. In his second season with the club, he was awarded the captaincy after [[Dean Bell]] retired, and again began the season at halfback. However, after he was injured in Round 10, New Zealand halfback [[Stacey Jones]] regained the half back role, and upon returning to the side Alexander was moved to the fullback position - where he would remain for most of the remaining season.\n\n===Return to the Panthers===\nAlexander eventually returned to Penrith in 1997 after his stint in New Zealand and stayed on until his retirement in 1999. His early season form for the Panthers in the new [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|Super League]] competition saw him selected at halfback for his first game for NSW since 1991 in the [[Super League Tri-series]]. After starring in NSW's 38-10 win over Queensland in the first game of the series.\n\nIn total, Alexander played 228 games for the Panthers, scored 100 tries, kicked 343 goals and 14 field goals, tallying 1,100 career points for the club. To date, he is one of only seven players ever score over 100 tries and over 1,000 points for a single club in top grade Australian rugby league. The others being [[Terry Lamb]] ([[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]]), [[Ryan Girdler]] ([[Penrith Panthers]]), [[Hazem El Masri]] ([[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]]), [[Darren Lockyer]] ([[Brisbane Broncos]]), [[Luke Burt]] ([[Parramatta Eels]]) and [[Jarrod Croker]] ([[Canberra Raiders]]).\n\n==Life after football==\nAfter his retirement from football in 1999, Alexander embarked on a media career in both radio and television. He currently works as a host and commentator for [[Foxtel]]'s [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] station.

The scene he referred to is the famous 'quittin' time' scene in which a slave calls quittin' time, presuming the role of the foreman, also a slave, to call quittin' time. Having asserted his rights, the foreman immediately calls 'quittin' time!' Ryan's reference to this scene, which he quoted literally, was to illustrate an incident which showed an apparent lack of teamwork between the referees controlling the game. Before an investigation could commence, Warren Ryan resigned. He had intended to retire at the end of the 2014 season, but brought it forward rather than endure the investigation. Ryan said, \"The word used to describe the character was a direct quote from the film. There was no offence intended, so I won't be apologising. It would be insincere.

Large numbers of Fairbairn Sykes knives of varying types, including some with wooden grips, were used by the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division that landed on Juno Beach on \"D\" Day and by the men of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion who jumped and fought on the same day. A solid gold F\u2013S fighting knife is part of the commandos' memorial at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe first batch of fifty F\u2013S fighting knives were produced in January 1941 by Wilkinson Sword Ltd after Fairbairn and Sykes had travelled to their factory from the Special Training Centre at [[Lochailort]] in November 1940 to discuss their ideas for a fighting knife.<ref>Allan, Stuart.

The vase handle grants precise grip, and the blade's design is especially suited to its use as a fighting knife. Fairbairn's rationale is in his book ''Get Tough!'' (1942):\n<blockquote>\nIn close-quarters fighting there is no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from your fingers in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.<ref>{{cite book |first= W. E. |last= Fairbairn |authorlink= William E.

The [[Shanghai knife]] on which it was based was only about {{convert|5.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} long in the blade. First pattern knives have a {{convert|6.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} blade with a flat area, or [[ricasso]], at the top of the blade which was not present on the original design and the presence of which has not been explained by the manufacturers, under the S-shaped [[crossguard]]. Second-pattern knives have a slightly longer blade (just less than {{convert|7|in|cm|abbr=on}}), {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}}-wide oval crossguard, [[Knurling|knurled]] pattern grip, and rounded ball, and may be stamped \"ENGLAND\" (a US legal requirement when importing the surplus knives after WWII, as they had to show the country of origin) on the handle side of the cross guard. Some may also be stamped with a \"[[Broad arrow|Broad Arrow]]\" /|\\ British issue mark and a number (e.g., 21) on the opposite handle side of the cross guard. Third-pattern knives also have a similarly sized seven-inch blade, but the handle was redesigned to be a ringed grip. This ringed grip is reputed to have distressed one of the original designers as it unbalanced the weapon and made harder to hold when wet, but it was used by the manufacturers as it was simple to produce and could be cast from a cheaper and more plentiful alloy instead of using up scarce quantities of brass stock which were, of course, required for ammunition casings and other such vital applications. William Rodgers, as part of the Egginton Group, now also produce an all-black \"sterile\" version of the knife, which is devoid of any markings showing maker for NATO use.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe length of the blade was chosen to give several inches of blade to penetrate the body after passing through the {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} of the thickest clothing that was anticipated to be worn in the war, namely that of Soviet [[greatcoat]]s. Later production runs of the F\u2013S fighting knife have a blade length that is about {{convert|7.5|in|cm|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn all cases the handle had a distinctive [[foil (fencing)|foil]]-like grip to enable a number of handling options.

Administered by the [[Australian Rugby League Commission]], the Kangaroos are ranked second in the [[RLIF World Rankings]]. The team is the most successful in [[Rugby League World Cup]] history, having contested all 15 and winning 11 of them, failing to reach the final only once; the [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|inaugural tournament]] in 1954. Only five nations have beaten Australia in test matches, and Australia have an overall win percentage of 67%.\n\nDating back to 1908, Australia are the fourth oldest national side after [[England national rugby league team|England]], [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] and [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]]. The team was first assembled in 1908 for a [[1908\u201309 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain|tour of Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite web|last=[[Australian Rugby League]] and [[National Rugby League]] |title=Rugby league |url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/whats_the_score/pdf/rugby_league.pdf |work=Australian Human Rights Commission Report |publisher=hreoc.gov.au |accessdate=13 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523132628/http://hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/whats_the_score/pdf/rugby_league.pdf |archivedate=23 May 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> The majority of the Kangaroos' games since then have been played against Great Britain and New Zealand. In the first half of the 20th century, Australia's international competition came from alternating tours to Great Britain and New Zealand, with Australia playing host to these teams in non-tour years. Great Britain dominated in the early years, and Australia did not win a Test against the Lions until 11 November 1911 under captain [[Chris McKivat]]. Australia did not win a series at home against Great Britain until 1920 or abroad until 1958.\n\nSince 1908, the team has been nicknamed '''the Kangaroos'''. Initially only used when touring [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]], and later [[France national rugby league team|France]], this has been the official nickname of the team since 7 July 1994. In [[Super League (Australia) season 1997|1997]] Australia was also represented by a ''Super League Australia'' team, drawing on players from that year's [[Super League (Australia)#Tests|Super League]] competition. While in the past players for the side had been selected from clubs in various leagues around the country, in recent years the side has consisted exclusively of players from clubs of the [[National Rugby League]].\n\n==History==\n{{align|right|{{RLIF World Rankings|Australia}}}}\n\n{{See also|History of rugby league}}\n\n[[Rugby football]] has been played in Australia since the 1860s. In 1863 [[Sydney University Football Club|Sydney University]] became the first rugby club to be formed in Sydney, and played games amongst themselves or against the crews of visiting British ships. The Sydney Football Club (1865) and the [[Wallaroos]] (1870) followed, and inter-club competition commenced. By 1880, there were 100 clubs across the country, and rugby quickly became the dominant winter sport for Sydney.\n\nIn 1888 an English team visited [[Australasia]], playing rugby rules in Queensland, [[New South Wales]] and New Zealand, and [[Australian rules football]] in Victoria and South Australia. In 1899, an Australian team was formed for the first time using players from Queensland and New South Wales. They played a series of Tests against a British team.\n\n===1900s===\nBy 1907, Sydney club rugby games were attracting up to 20,000 people, with all profits going to the [[New South Wales Rugby Union|Southern Rugby Football Union]], as the sport at the time was officially an amateur one. This caused discontent among players, and in 1908 the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]] and [[Queensland Rugby League]] were formed.\n\nAn Australian national rugby league team was first formed during the first season of [[rugby league in Australia]], the [[1908 NSWRFL Premiership]] season. The team, which was made of players from the NSWRFL with a few Queensland rugby rebels added, first played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|\"professional All Blacks\"]] on the return leg of their [[1907\u201308 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain|tour of Australia and Great Britain]].\n\nLater that year the Australian team arranged to go on a tour of its own. The [[1908\u201309 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain|first Kangaroos]] arrived in England on 27 September 1908, and played their first ever test against the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] in December in London. It finished 22 all in front of a crowd of 2,000. The second test in Newcastle in January 1909 attracted a crowd of 22,000, and the Northern Union won 15\u20135. The third test was played at [[Villa Park]], Birmingham, the Northern Union winning again 6\u20135 before a crowd of 9,000. The Australians suggested that the series should be named 'The Ashes' after the cricket series of the same name.\n\nIn 1909, when the new \"[[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]]\" code was still in its infancy in Australia, a match between the Kangaroos and the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] was played before a crowd of around 20,000, with the Rugby League side winning 29\u201326.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | title = Kangaroos v.

But they won the first test in Sydney against Australia 27\u201320 in front of 42,000. They then won the second test in [[Brisbane]] 22\u201317. In [[Auckland]], on 30 July, they defeated New Zealand 52\u201320. The [[1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand]] was the first ever, and Australia were beaten for the Ashes in two tests, faring slightly better as \"[[Australasia rugby league team|Australasia]]\" with two Kiwis added to their squad. The [[1911\u201312 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]] was undertaken by an '[[Australasia rugby league team|Australasian]]' squad which included four New Zealanders. They won the Ashes for the first time and for the next half a century no other touring team did do so on British soil.\n\nThe [[1914 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand]] was the second time the British toured down under.

The [[1921\u201322 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]] also included a New Zealander and was ostensibly an [[Australasia rugby league team|Australasian side]]. In January 1922, an \"England\" side defeated Australia 6\u20130 at [[The Willows, Salford|The Willows]], [[City of Salford|Salford]], to win back the Ashes that had been lost in 1920. They did not lose again until 1950.\n\nThe Australian national team first wore green and gold in a hooped design, on Saturday 23 June 1928, when they met Great Britain in the first Test at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]]. Britain led 10\u20132 after 25&nbsp;minutes, 13\u20137 at half time and, after a nervous second half, eventually claimed the Test 15\u201312. The England team won both the 1928 series in Australia and New Zealand by two tests to one. They were presented with the Ashes Trophy by the Australians, which the two countries have competed for ever since.\n\nThe [[1929\u201330 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]] was the fourth Kangaroo tour, and took the Australian team all around England and also into Wales. The tour also featured the ninth [[Ashes series (rugby league)|Ashes series]] which comprised four Test matches and was won by Great Britain.\n\n===1930s===\nThe first test of the 1932 Ashes series between Australia and Great Britain drew a world record international rugby league attendance of 70,204 to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. This attendance stood as the world record until the 1992 World Cup Final played at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], and as of 2013 remains the record attendance for a rugby league test played in Australia. The [[Jim Sullivan (rugby league)|Jim Sullivan]] led Lions triumphed over the [[Herb Steinohrt]] led Australians 8\u20136.\n\nOn the 1933\u201334 tour New South Wales winger [[Dave Brown (rugby league, born 1913)|Dave Brown]] played in 32 matches, including all 3 Tests, scoring 285 points, at the time the greatest number ever attained by an Australian player on tour.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | title = Dave Brown Retires\n  |work=The Sydney Morning Herald\n  | place = Australia\n  | page = 4\n  | language =\n  | publisher=\n  | date = 14 April 1941\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=x4UQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=apUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6144,5097866\n  | accessdate = 1 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAn exhibition match between Australia and Great Britain at Paris' [[Stade Pershing]] in December 1933 inspired the beginnings of [[rugby league in France]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lyle |first=Beaton |title=75 Years of French Rugby League |url=http://www.rleague.com/content/article.php?id=32875 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908091158/http://www.rleague.com/content/article.php?id=32875 |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 September 2012 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |newspaper=rleague.com |date=7 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===1940s===\n[[Albert Johnston (rugby league)|Albert Johnston]] was a national selector in 1946 and coach of the national side for the 1946 first post-WWII Anglo-Australian series.\nAustralia's [[1948-49 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]] was their seventh tour to the UK.

Australia failed to reach the final.\n\nFor the [[1956\u201357 Kangaroo tour]] a record eleven Queenslanders were selected in the touring squad.

Great Britain won 10\u20133.\n\n[[Harry Bath]] was selected manager, coach and as the sole selector for the Australian national team's 1962 Ashes series.\n\nAfter ten previous tours of Britain, the [[1963-64 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1963\u201364 Kangaroo tour]] saw Australia's first ever Ashes victory on British soil. The [[Arthur Summons]] coached Kangaroos won the first test at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] before rampaging to a famous 50\u201312 win in the second test at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]] in [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]]. Although they lost the third test at Headingley, legendary winger [[Ken Irvine]] became the first Australian player to score a try in each test of an Ashes series. The Kangaroos have not lost a series in Britain since.<ref>{{cite web|last=sahof.org.au|title=Kangaroos Team (Rugby League) \u2013 1963|url=http://www.sahof.org.au/awards/member-profile/?teamAwardID=10|work=Team Sport Australia Award|publisher=Sport Australia Hall of Fame|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nHarry Bath coached the national side to World Cup glory in the [[1968 Rugby League World Cup|1968 World Cup]]. He also coached the team on a tour of New Zealand in 1969.\n\n===1970s===\nThe last time that Great Britain won the Ashes was in 1970. They won the series 2\u20131 in Australia. Out of 24 games played Great Britain won 22, drew one and lost one \u2013 making them the most successful British tourists so far. The 1970 Lions contained a galaxy of stars including captain [[Frank Myler]], [[Roger Millward]], [[Cliff Watson]] and [[Mal Reilly]]. Future Kangaroo Tour captain and later coach [[Bob Fulton]] made his test debut in the 1970 Ashes series (Fulton had actually played 3 games for Australia in the 1968 World Cup but at the time tests and World Cup games were classed differently). Harry Bath again coached Australia to victory in the [[1970 Rugby League World Cup|1970 World Cup Final]] in a brutal game that became known as the \"Battle of Headingley\". Bath also coached the team on a tour of New Zealand in 1971. On that tour [[Geoff Starling]] became the youngest player to ever represent Australia. He was 18 years and 181 days old when playing a tour match against a New Zealand XIII at [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Ritchie|first=Dean|title=Folau the youngest Roo|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/league/folau-the-youngest-roo/story-e6frf3ou-1111114570135|accessdate=2 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=5 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nAustralia lost the [[1972 World Cup]] [[1972 Rugby League World Cup Final|Final]] to Great Britain in controversial circumstances. Australian captain [[Graeme Langlands]] was denied what seemed a fair try by being ruled offside by the French referee after catching a kick put up by halfback [[Dennis Ward (rugby league)|Dennis Ward]]. Television footage of the try showed Langlands was approximately a metre behind Ward when he kicked the ball. The French referee Georges Jameau's alleged reason for not awarding the try was that he did not believe anyone could have scored it from an onside position. The World Cup final was tied at 10\u201310 after full-time and was still locked after extra time. Great Britain were awarded the victory due to a higher points table placing after the pool rounds of the competition. The Final was also highlighted by an 80-metre try to Lions captain, winger [[Clive Sullivan]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6QneX1iBrI 1972 World Cup Final highlights]</ref>\n\nOn the [[1978 Kangaroo tour]], Great Britain defeated Australia in the second test at Bradford, 18\u201314, before a crowd of 26,447. It took ten years, and fifteen consecutive test defeats before Britain were able to defeat the Kangaroos again, starting with Australia's 3\u20130 whitewash of the Lions during their 1979 Australasian tour. The Kangaroos had already won the first test 15\u20139 at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Wigan]] and wrapped up the series with a 23\u20136 win in the third test at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium|Headingley]]. However, the Australians were surprisingly defeated by the French team in both tests played at the end of the 1978 tour. This was the last defeat of the Kangaroos in a series until 2005.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s was the decade in which Australia began to truly dominate world rugby league. Along with the emergence of [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] football came a new crop of superstar players who led Australia throughout the 1980s. Players such as [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]], [[Mal Meninga]], [[Wayne Pearce]], [[Brett Kenny]], [[Eric Grothe, Sr.|Eric Grothe]] and [[Wally Lewis]] came to prominence on the [[1982 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]]. Australia's performance was taken into a new dimension by the tourists, also known as '[[The Invincibles (Rugby League)|the Invincibles]]', when they became the first team to win every game of the tour (fifteen games) including the first test by 40\u20134 at Hull in front of 26,771 spectators. After the extremely poor showing during their 1979 Australasian tour, the Kangaroos rammed home just how far behind British football had fallen at [[Boothferry Park]]. The score was only 10\u20134 at half time, but after the break Australia's superior fitness showed and they ran in six unanswered tries to leave the crowd and British football stunned.\n\nIn 1983, [[Arthur Beetson]] became the first Aboriginal to coach the Australian team after [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]] had stood down following the Kangaroo Tour. Although Australia won the first test against New Zealand at [[Carlaw Park]] in [[Auckland]], the Kiwis shocked by winning the return match 19\u201312 at Lang Park.\n\nWhen the Lions toured in 1984, The Kangaroos again swept The Ashes series 3\u20130 under new team captain Wally Lewis, the first Queenslander to captain Australia since Arthur Beetson in 1974. Beetson was replaced as coach in 1984 by a returning Frank Stanton.\n\nIn 1985, Australia made a [[1985 Kangaroo tour of New Zealand|six-match tour]] of New Zealand under the coaching of [[Terry Fearnley]] who prior to the tour had coached NSW to its first ever [[1985 State of Origin series|Origin series]] win over Qld (the tour actually took place between games 2 and 3 of the Origin series). The Kangaroos won five of those matches, and the Test series 2\u20131. Australia won the first Test in Brisbane 26\u201320. On Sunday 30 June 1985, Australia met New Zealand in the second Test at [[Carlaw Park]], [[Auckland]]. The Test was a 20,000 sell-out, with all tickets accounted for weeks before the match. The Kiwis dominated long periods of the game but ninety seconds from time the Kiwis lost possession close to half way. [[John Ribot]] scored a try and Australia won 10\u20136. The tour ended in acrimony as tensions between coach Fearley and the Qld players, led by team captain Wally Lewis, reached boiling point with Lewis publicly stating that he had caught Fearnley and team vice-captain Wayne Pearce going over team selections in Fearnley's hotel room, though both Fearnley and Pearce denied the allegations. After the second test win Fearnley made 4 changes to the test team for the third and final test at Carlaw Park with all four players who were omitted being Queenslanders. The changes proved disastrous and NZ ran out easy 18\u20130 winners.\n\nFollowing the tour, the Australian Rugby League decided that from then on the Kangaroos coach could not also double as the incumbent coach of either NSW or Qld.\n\nFormer Kangaroo [[Don Furner]] became Australian coach in 1986 and immediately formed a good working relationship with Wally Lewis and the players. The now harmonious Australians swept New Zealand 3\u20130 in a [[1986 Trans-Tasman Test series|mid-season test series]] played in Australia.\n\nDuring the [[1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]] a then record northern hemisphere crowd of 50,383 attended the first test of the Ashes series at [[Old Trafford]] with the Walle Lewis led Australians winning 38\u201316. On 16 December 1986 the Kangaroos set a new record for largest-ever winning margin in a Test match at 52\u20130 against [[France national rugby league team|France]]. In their two Tests against France, the Australians ran in 96 points<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | title = Unbeaten Kangaroos the 'Best Ever'\n  |work=The Sydney Morning Herald\n  | place =\n  | page = 39\n  | language =\n  | publisher=Fairfax Digital\n  | date = 15 December 1986\n  | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&docID=news861215_0108_9422\n  | accessdate = 6 October 2009}}</ref> and conceded just a single penalty goal. After suffering such heavy losses, France decided to call off their proposed 1987 tour of Australia. This became the second consecutive tour of Europe in which Australia had won all their games. By the end of the tour, [[Terry Lamb]] had become the first player to appear in every match on a Kangaroo Tour. For this tour Wally Lewis, [[Greg Dowling]], [[Bob Lindner]], [[Gene Miles]] ([[Wynnum Manly Seagulls|Wynnum Manly]]) and [[Bryan Neibling]] ([[Redcliffe Dolphins|Redcliffe]]) became the last players selected to tour from the [[Brisbane Rugby League]] competition. By being named as tour captain, Wally Lewis became the first Queenslander to captain a Kangaroo Tour since [[Tom Gorman (rugby league)|Tom Gorman]] in 1929/30.\n\nAustralia crashed to a defeat on Tuesday 21 July 1987, when the Kangaroo dominance of the international game suffered a setback. New Zealand were their opponents in a match at Lang Park which had been arranged to fill the gap created by the non-appearance of France. New Zealand won the game 13\u20136.

The first test, played at the [[Olympic Park Stadium]] in [[Melbourne]] (the first rugby league test played in Australia outside of NSW or Qld) saw the Kiwis again defeat Australia after a successful Kangaroo tour. NZ won the first test 24\u20138 in Melbourne in front of 26,900 fans, however a new look Australian side came back to win the second test 44\u20130 in Sydney and the third test 40\u201312 in Brisbane.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/australia-vs-new-zealand-1991/summary.html 1991 Australia vs New Zealand at Rugby League Project]</ref> At the end of the [[1991 NSWRL season]], the Kangaroos embarked on their first (and as of 2017 only) [[1991 Kangaroo tour of Papua New Guinea|tour of]] [[Papua New Guinea]], winning all five games on tour including easily both tests against the Papua New Guinea Kumuls.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/tours/kangaroos-tour-1991/summary.html 1991 Kangaroo tour of Papua New Guinea]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia]], the British lost the first test 22\u20136 in Sydney before stunning the Australians when they easily won the 2nd Ashes test 33\u201310 at [[Princes Park (stadium)|Princes Park]] in Melbourne, but lost the 3rd test 16\u201310 in Brisbane. The [[1992 Rugby League World Cup final]] at Wembley Stadium set a then international attendance record for a rugby league international of 73,631. The Bob Fulton coached, Mal Meninga captained Australians defeat Great Britain 10\u20136 to win their 7th [[Rugby League World Cup]] title. The WCF was a tight game with the Lions leading 6\u20134 with less than 20 minutes remaining before an on debut [[Steve Renouf]] crossed for the only try of the game and along with Meninga's sideline conversion gave the Kangaroos a famous victory.<ref name=\"rugbyleagueproject1989\">[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-cup-1989/final/great-britain-vs-australia.html 1992 World Cup Final at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\nAustralia again played a [[1993 Trans-Tasman Test series|mid-season test series]] against New Zealand in 1993. The first test at the [[Mt Smart Stadium]] in Auckland ended in a 14-all draw thanks to a late [[Laurie Daley]] field goal. Daley had captained Australia for the first time in the match following a two-game suspension to Mal Meninga. The Kangaroos then won the second test 16\u20138 at the very wet [[Palmerston North Showgrounds]] before wrapping up the series with a 16\u20134 win at Lang Park in Brisbane.\n\nOn 4 July 1994, Australia defeated France [[1994 French rugby league Oceania tour|58\u20130]] at the [[Parramatta Stadium]] in Sydney, their only test on home soil for the year.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/france-vs-australia-1994/australia-vs-france.html 1994 Australia vs France at Rugby League Project]</ref> The [[1994 Kangaroo Tour]] was the last time the Australian national team played matches against British provincial teams, in addition to the Tests. Australia continued its dominance, winning both Test series against Great Britain and France, suffering only one loss (again, against Great Britain in the First Test at Wembley), and remained undefeated against British club outfits in a streak stretching back to 1978. Australia adopted the name 'Kangaroos' for the July test against France, since then the team has been officially known by this name. The 1994 Kangaroo tour was also the first (and only) time that the traditional Australian test kit was only worn during test matches. For the tour games, including the friendly against Wales in [[Cardiff]] (the first time Australia had played Wales in 12 years), the Kangaroos wore jumpers that had increasing thickness gold hoops underneath the twin gold chevrons.\n\nThe Australian team that contested and won the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup]] consisted only of players from clubs that remained loyal to the Australian Rugby League during the [[Super League war]]. This meant several players from Super League-aligned clubs that were already well-established internationals were not selected for the World Cup squad. During 1995, the Kangaroos defeated New Zealand 3\u20130 in the [[1995 Trans-Tasman Test series|Trans-Tasman Test series]] played in Australia. As they were for the World Cup, only ARL loyal players were selected for Australia which saw a number of players, including [[Steve Menzies]], [[Mark Coyne (rugby league)|Mark Coyne]], [[Terry Hill]], [[Gary Larson (rugby league)|Gary Larson]], [[Trevor Gillmeister]] and [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] make their test debuts during the New Zealand series. Despite having what many described as a second string side without players such as Laurie Daley, [[Allan Langer]], [[Andrew Ettingshausen]], [[Brett Mullins]], [[Glenn Lazarus]], [[Bradley Clyde]], [[Ian Roberts (rugby league)|Ian Roberts]], [[Ricky Stuart]] and [[Steve Walters]], Bob Fulton's Kangaroos won their 8th World Cup (and 5th in a row) when they defeated England 16\u20138 in the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] in front of 66,540 fans at Wembley. The star of the day for Australia was halfback/hooker [[Andrew Johns]].\n\nIn 1997 also, due to the [[Super League war]], Australian rugby league was split down the middle by two competitions: the ARL's [[Optus Cup]] and Super League's [[Telstra Cup]].

In Australia's opening match against Papua New Guinea, captain Darren Lockyer surpassed Ken Irvine's record for most test tries for Australia, scoring his 34th. Australia won all of their matches comfortably to advance to the final to have a 2008 World Cup final re-match against New Zealand at [[Suncorp Stadium]].

However Australia's record against the Kiwis at the venue continued to be a negative one after another defeat made it three defeats in the past four meetings at the 'Cauldron'. This meant Australia were facing England in a must win game at AAMI Park in Melbourne. With many regulars missing, Sheens had to make decisions like naming an 18-year old in the team, who'd become the youngest player to play for Australia. [[Sione Mata'utia]], aged 18 years and 129 days, eclipsed the previous record held by Israel Folau, since 2007, by 65 days when he played on debut for Australia against the 'Poms'. The match was headlined with controversy. In the last minute of the game, England put a grubber kick in the in-goal area, since they were desperate for a try as they were trailing by just four points. Australian fullback [[Greg Inglis]] had to force the ball dead due to incoming England attack but the video referees wanted to have another look and see whether or not it was Inglis or the incoming English winger Ryan Hall got the last touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays it showed that Ryan Hall's right hand's little finger had put some downward pressure on the ball however in normal speed it was deemed 'inconclusive' by Australian officiating rules and therefore a NO TRY was given to the frustration of the English players and supporters but respect from Sheens and his Australian players. Had the try been awarded and England converted, it would have been Australia's first defeat to England since 1995, the first time they suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1970 and the first time they failed to qualify for a tournament final since 1954.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Four Nations: England denied late try as Australia win in Melbourne\n  | publisher = skySPORTS\n  | date = 2 November 2014\n  | url = http://www.skysports.com/rugby-league/australia-vs-england/41788\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Sheens: England no-try correct decision\n  | publisher = Sportal\n  | date = 2 November 2014\n  | url = http://www.sportal.co.nz/league/news/sheens-england-no-try-correct-decision/1j65r570o24e91t2k4zgow5fm8\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref> In their final round-robin fixture they dominated proceedings against the Samoans, who had been causing trouble for England and New Zealand in the tournament, to advance to the final which was held in New Zealand. However they couldn't get revenge for their defeat earlier in the tournament as Australia lost 18\u201322.\n\nThe [[2015 Anzac Test]] was held in Suncorp Stadium. The Australian team's horrible record in Brisbane against the Kiwis continued as they suffered another defeat and records continued to be made for the New Zealand team. This was the first time they beat Australia for three consecutive test-matches since 1953 and the first time they won the Anzac Test since 1998. Australia did not play another test-match that year.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Anzac Test: Kangaroos say only have one Test in 2015 doesn\u2019t affect importance of representing Australia\n  | publisher = The Courier Mail\n  | date = 29 April 2015\n  | url = http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/anzac-test-kangaroos-say-only-have-one-test-in-2015-doesnt-affect-importance-of-representing-australia/news-story/4a2701ae1d41ddb6d132ef5682d628db\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news \n  | title = NRL must cut season and play more test matches, says former ARL boss Geoff Carr\n  | publisher = stuff sport\n  | date = 5 May 2015\n  | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/68276033/nrl-must-cut-season-and-play-more-test-matches-says-former-arl-boss-geoff-carr\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref>\nAfter the match Sheens was facing scrutiny from the media after many believed it was time for the old players he fielded to move on since the much younger Kiwis side had beaten them on the past three occasions. Australia also dropped down to number 2 on the [[RLIF World Rankings]], which added further scrutiny. At the end of the year, Sheens was unable to cope with the pressure of the media, despite wanting to coach the team at the 2017 World Cup. He took up an advisory role with English domestic club Salford Red Devils and therefore resigned as coach of the Australian national team.\n\nIn December 2015, successful Queensland Maroons coach [[Mal Meninga]] announced he'd leave his role as the coach of the Queensland representative side to coach the Australian national team. Before his appointment Mal announced his ambitions that he wanted the International game to become the pinnacle of rugby league like it was in his playing days.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = League: Mal Meninga wants international football restored as pinnacle of the game\n  | newspaper = The Telegraph\n  | date = 20 November 2015\n  | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11548650\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nMal Meninga's first game in charge as Australian coach was the [[2016 Anzac Test]]. Prior to the test, Meninga stirred controversy around the rugby league world after selecting Fijian born player [[Semi Radradra]], who is eligible due to living in Australia for three years, in his team over other 'homegrown' Australian players. Radradra, who represented Fiji at the 2013 World Cup, still had a Fijian passport at that time and this brought up the question of changing eligibility rules in International rugby league. Meninga's selection questioned the ambition he raised of wanting to make the International game the pinnacle of the sport. Australia won the test-match 16\u20130 and in the process ended their losing-run against the Kiwis. They also held New Zealand scoreless in a test-match for the first time since 2007. But despite the result Australia suffered criticism with commentator Phil Gould saying the Australian team is 'too old' and are 'kidding themselves if they think they'll win the World Cup next year'. He believes Australia should've put much more points on a 'weakened' New Zealand team missing many regular players through various reasons. Meninga hit back saying 'That was a real test-match. That's what test footy is. People who have never played it don't know what it is.'<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Meninga defends victorious Kangaroos after 'rugged' win over Kiwis\n  | publisher = Kiama Independent\n  | date = 7 May 2016\n  | url = http://www.kiamaindependent.com.au/story/3893636/meninga-defends-victorious-kangaroos-after-rugged-win-over-kiwis-photos/?cs=2452\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref> \nAt the conclusion of the 2016 domestic season, Australia took on New Zealand in Perth in what was the first ever [[2016 Rugby League Four Nations#Australia vs New Zealand|test-match]] in Western Australia. Meninga's men then began their [[2016 Rugby League Four Nations|2016 Four Nations]] campaign with comfortable 42-point win over Scotland, in the first ever meeting between the two countries. After a tough encounter with New Zealand, and a convincing win over England, Australia met their Trans-Tasman rivals once again in the final. Meninga's Roos made the final tournament match look easy, as the Kangaroos dominated their opponents with a 26-point victory, claiming their third tournament title in the process.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Australia 34-8 New Zealand: Mal Meninga's ruthless side storm to victory in Four Nations final at Anfield\n  | publisher = Daily Mail Australia\n  | date = 21 November 2016\n  | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/article-3954908/Australia-34-8-New-Zealand-Mal-Meninga-s-ruthless-storm-victory-Four-Nations-final-Anfield.html\n  | accessdate = 5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the last ever scheduled [[2017 Anzac Test|Anzac Test]], captain [[Cameron Smith]] became just the second player to play 50 tests for Australia, behind former captain, and record cap holder, [[Darren Lockyer]]. He became the first Australian to wear the gold chevron on his shoulder after a new initiative created by Meninga last year. Other players are also honoured, with players that have earned 20+ caps wearing a white chevron, 30+ wearing a bronze chevron, and 40+ wearing a silver chevron on their shoulder.

Later in the year, countries were preparing for the grandest stage in the international game, the [[2017 Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]]. However, the biggest talking point wasn't about whether Australia would defend their title. It was around Tonga, after many players of Tongan heritage, had quit the opportunity to represent the New Zealand squad in order to play for Tonga. Regular Australian prop forward, [[Andrew Fifita]], also followed suit, after initially being announced in Meninga's squad, to the disapproval of Australian halfback [[Cooper Cronk]].<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Kangaroos star Cooper Cronk labels Andrew Fifita's late defection to Tonga as 'poor'\n  | publisher = stuff sport\n  | date = 6 October 2017\n  | url = https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/97610160/Kangaroos-star-Cooper-Cronk-labels-Andrew-Fifitas-late-defection-to-Tonga-as-poor\n  | accessdate = 5 December 2017}}</ref> Meninga, however, also voiced his opinion saying he had no issue with Fifita's decision, as it was great for Tonga, and the international game. After conceding early, Australia went on to grit out a tough victory over England. The Kangaroos then went on to beat a spirited French team, in a game which saw [[Wade Graham]] became the seventh player to equal the record of four tries in a World Cup game, and only the second Australian forward to score four tries in a single game, since Gorden Tallis in 2000.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Australia 52-6 France: Wade Graham scores four tries on just his second appearance as Kangaroos record emphatic victory in World Cup clash\n  | publisher = Daily Mail Australia\n  | date = 3 November 2017\n  | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/article-5046457/Australia-52-6-France-Wade-Graham-scores-four-tries.html\n  | accessdate = 5 December 2017}}</ref> Australia finished off their pool stage games, with a comprehensive victory over a gallant Lebanese outfit. Australia then advanced past Samoa to the semi-finals with ease, thanks to a record-breaking five tries in a single World Cup match from [[Valentine Holmes]].

Australia also became the first team to win 11 World Cup crowns. The final score of 6\u20130, made this the lowest scoring World Cup final in the history of the tournament.

When playing in Australia the team wore sky-blue or maroon, depending on whether they were playing in New South Wales or Queensland. On tours, Australia wore either the sky blue of New South Wales (as the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] organised the tours) or a maroon and sky blue hooped design.\n\nIn 1924 the decision was taken to change the national jersey's colours to green and gold. A green jersey with gold bands was used for Australia's next Test series in 1928, making the 1928 Kangaroos the first Australian representative rugby league team to adopt these colours. This design was revived for 25 July 2003 Test against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]]. In 1929 the current design, which is green with two gold chevrons, was adopted and first used.\n\nIn 1997 during the [[Super League war]], the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] only Australian team wore a green shirt with a blue and yellow chevron for the [[1997 Anzac Test|Anzac Test]] against New Zealand and the [[Super League Test series]] against Great Britain. In their only game that year, the ARL Australian team wore the traditional kit for their one-game against a Rest of the World team made up of international players with ARL contracts.\n\nThe original blue and maroon broken striped design was revived in 1963 when Australia hosted a touring [[South Africa national rugby league team|South African rugby league team]] who also wore a predominantly green jumper with gold trim,<ref>{{Cite news\n  | last = Clarkson\n  | first = Alan\n  | title = Historic Jerseys for Aust.

It was again used in the [[2014 Rugby League Four Nations|2014 Four Nations]] against [[England national rugby league team|England]] in [[AAMI Park|Melbourne]] on 2 November 2014 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the \"Rorke's Drift Test\".\n\nSince 2013, Australia's kits have been supplied by [[Canterbury of New Zealand]]. They replaced [[Classic Sportswear|Classic]] who lasted between late 1999 to 2012. Canterbury had also supplied the kits during the mid-1990s while Classic had supplied the kits from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. Other suppliers were [[Adidas]] (1978-1982), [[Classic Sportswear]] (1983-1991, 1993-1997), [[Umbro]] (1992) and [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] (1997 - SL).\n\nThe 1994 Kangaroo tour saw the introduction of a special 'tour games only' jersey, leaving the traditional kit for test matches. The jersey was essentially the same though gold hoops of increasing thickness were added to the jumper below the traditional gold chevrons. The 1994 tour was the only time this jersey was used. This had followed on from the idea of using a different jersey for non-test games on a tour that was started in 1992 when Australia was in England for the [[1992 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]]. The Kangaroos played three warm up games against [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]], [[Sheffield Eagles (1984)|Sheffield]] and [[Cumbria rugby league team|Cumbria]] wearing a predominantly white jersey with large green and gold diamonds in the shape of kit supplier Umbro.\n\n{|\n|{{Football kit

indigenous contribution to the Kangaroos is unmatched in Australian national sporting teams.\n\nBy way of example, Lionel Morgan was the first indigenous player in any Australian national sporting team in 1960, while Arthur Beetson was the first indigenous captain of any Australian national sporting team in 1973 when he captained the team in the final game of the [[1973 Kangaroo tour]], the second test against [[France national rugby league team|France]] at the [[Stade des Minimes]] in [[Toulouse]] on 16 December. Australia won the game 14\u20133.\n\nRemarkably given the 2% indigenous rate of population in Australia, the Kangaroos fielded a run-on team against New Zealand in the [[2015 Anzac Test]] with 7 of the 13 players having indigenous heritage (a staggering 54%). This contrasts markedly to nearly every other Australian national sporting team as at 2015.\n\n===War cry===\nFrom 1908 to 1967, the Australian team performed a war cry before Tests played in Great Britain and France. The war cry was first performed when the Kangaroos arrived at [[Tilbury]] Docks near London. It was developed after war cries had been performed on tours of Britain by the New Zealand [[All Blacks]] in 1905, the South African [[Springboks]] in 1906 and the New Zealand [[1907-1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Great Britain|All Golds]] in 1907. It is believed that the war cry is derived from an indigenous chant on [[Stradbroke Island]], Queensland, Australia.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/26/1059084220273.html \tFor crying out loud, where's Australia's war song?]</ref>\n\n[[File:GB_v_AUS_09-11-1963_at_Station_Road_1.jpg|right|thumb|The Kangaroos performing the war cry prior to the [[1963\u201364 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|test against Great Britain in 1963]]  at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]].]]\n{| cellpadding=6\n|-\n!

the '''Kangaroos''') have represented Australia in senior men's [[rugby league]] football competition since the establishment of [[Rugby league in Australia|the 'Northern Union game' in Australia]] in 1908. Administered by the [[Australian Rugby League Commission]], the Kangaroos are ranked second in the [[RLIF World Rankings]]. The team is the most successful in [[Rugby League World Cup]] history, having contested all 15 and winning 11 of them, failing to reach the final only once; the [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|inaugural tournament]] in 1954. Only five nations have beaten Australia in test matches, and Australia have an overall win percentage of 67%.\n\nDating back to 1908, Australia are the fourth oldest national side after [[England national rugby league team|England]], [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] and [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]]. The team was first assembled in 1908 for a [[1908\u201309 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain|tour of Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite web|last=[[Australian Rugby League]] and [[National Rugby League]] |title=Rugby league |url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/whats_the_score/pdf/rugby_league.pdf |work=Australian Human Rights Commission Report |publisher=hreoc.gov.au |accessdate=13 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523132628/http://hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/whats_the_score/pdf/rugby_league.pdf |archivedate=23 May 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> The majority of the Kangaroos' games since then have been played against Great Britain and New Zealand. In the first half of the 20th century, Australia's international competition came from alternating tours to Great Britain and New Zealand, with Australia playing host to these teams in non-tour years. Great Britain dominated in the early years, and Australia did not win a Test against the Lions until 11 November 1911 under captain [[Chris McKivat]]. Australia did not win a series at home against Great Britain until 1920 or abroad until 1958.\n\nSince 1908, the team has been nicknamed '''the Kangaroos'''. Initially only used when touring [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]], and later [[France national rugby league team|France]], this has been the official nickname of the team since 7 July 1994. In [[Super League (Australia) season 1997|1997]] Australia was also represented by a ''Super League Australia'' team, drawing on players from that year's [[Super League (Australia)#Tests|Super League]] competition. While in the past players for the side had been selected from clubs in various leagues around the country, in recent years the side has consisted exclusively of players from clubs of the [[National Rugby League]].\n\n==History==\n{{align|right|{{RLIF World Rankings|Australia}}}}\n\n{{See also|History of rugby league}}\n\n[[Rugby football]] has been played in Australia since the 1860s. In 1863 [[Sydney University Football Club|Sydney University]] became the first rugby club to be formed in Sydney, and played games amongst themselves or against the crews of visiting British ships. The Sydney Football Club (1865) and the [[Wallaroos]] (1870) followed, and inter-club competition commenced. By 1880, there were 100 clubs across the country, and rugby quickly became the dominant winter sport for Sydney.\n\nIn 1888 an English team visited [[Australasia]], playing rugby rules in Queensland, [[New South Wales]] and New Zealand, and [[Australian rules football]] in Victoria and South Australia. In 1899, an Australian team was formed for the first time using players from Queensland and New South Wales. They played a series of Tests against a British team.\n\n===1900s===\nBy 1907, Sydney club rugby games were attracting up to 20,000 people, with all profits going to the [[New South Wales Rugby Union|Southern Rugby Football Union]], as the sport at the time was officially an amateur one. This caused discontent among players, and in 1908 the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]] and [[Queensland Rugby League]] were formed.\n\nAn Australian national rugby league team was first formed during the first season of [[rugby league in Australia]], the [[1908 NSWRFL Premiership]] season. The team, which was made of players from the NSWRFL with a few Queensland rugby rebels added, first played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|\"professional All Blacks\"]] on the return leg of their [[1907\u201308 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain|tour of Australia and Great Britain]].\n\nLater that year the Australian team arranged to go on a tour of its own. The [[1908\u201309 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain|first Kangaroos]] arrived in England on 27 September 1908, and played their first ever test against the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] in December in London. It finished 22 all in front of a crowd of 2,000. The second test in Newcastle in January 1909 attracted a crowd of 22,000, and the Northern Union won 15\u20135. The third test was played at [[Villa Park]], Birmingham, the Northern Union winning again 6\u20135 before a crowd of 9,000. The Australians suggested that the series should be named 'The Ashes' after the cricket series of the same name.\n\nIn 1909, when the new \"[[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]]\" code was still in its infancy in Australia, a match between the Kangaroos and the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] was played before a crowd of around 20,000, with the Rugby League side winning 29\u201326.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | title = Kangaroos v.

But they won the first test in Sydney against Australia 27\u201320 in front of 42,000. They then won the second test in [[Brisbane]] 22\u201317. In [[Auckland]], on 30 July, they defeated New Zealand 52\u201320. The [[1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand]] was the first ever, and Australia were beaten for the Ashes in two tests, faring slightly better as \"[[Australasia rugby league team|Australasia]]\" with two Kiwis added to their squad. The [[1911\u201312 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]] was undertaken by an '[[Australasia rugby league team|Australasian]]' squad which included four New Zealanders. They won the Ashes for the first time and for the next half a century no other touring team did do so on British soil.\n\nThe [[1914 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand]] was the second time the British toured down under. The Australians, captained by Sid Deane for all three tests,<ref>{{cite web|last=Whiticker|first=Alan|title=Sid Deane|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/sid-deane/summary.html|work=rugbyleagueproject.org|publisher=Shawn Dollin, Andrew Ferguson and Bill Bates|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> got one victory but lost the series in the famous decider, the \"Rorke's Drift Test\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Player Profile \u2013 Wally Messenger |url=http://www.yesterdayshero.com.au/PlayerProfile_Wally-Messenger_5733.aspx |work=yesterdayshero.com.au |publisher=SmartPack International |accessdate=19 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234114/http://www.yesterdayshero.com.au/PlayerProfile_Wally-Messenger_5733.aspx |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> Australia also went on a tour of New Zealand in 1919.\n\n===1920s===\nThe [[1920 Great Britain Lions tour]] saw Australia win the [[Ashes series (rugby league)|Ashes]] for the first time on home soil. The [[1921\u201322 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]] also included a New Zealander and was ostensibly an [[Australasia rugby league team|Australasian side]]. In January 1922, an \"England\" side defeated Australia 6\u20130 at [[The Willows, Salford|The Willows]], [[City of Salford|Salford]], to win back the Ashes that had been lost in 1920. They did not lose again until 1950.\n\nThe Australian national team first wore green and gold in a hooped design, on Saturday 23 June 1928, when they met Great Britain in the first Test at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]]. Britain led 10\u20132 after 25&nbsp;minutes, 13\u20137 at half time and, after a nervous second half, eventually claimed the Test 15\u201312. The England team won both the 1928 series in Australia and New Zealand by two tests to one. They were presented with the Ashes Trophy by the Australians, which the two countries have competed for ever since.\n\nThe [[1929\u201330 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]] was the fourth Kangaroo tour, and took the Australian team all around England and also into Wales. The tour also featured the ninth [[Ashes series (rugby league)|Ashes series]] which comprised four Test matches and was won by Great Britain.\n\n===1930s===\nThe first test of the 1932 Ashes series between Australia and Great Britain drew a world record international rugby league attendance of 70,204 to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. This attendance stood as the world record until the 1992 World Cup Final played at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], and as of 2013 remains the record attendance for a rugby league test played in Australia. The [[Jim Sullivan (rugby league)|Jim Sullivan]] led Lions triumphed over the [[Herb Steinohrt]] led Australians 8\u20136.\n\nOn the 1933\u201334 tour New South Wales winger [[Dave Brown (rugby league, born 1913)|Dave Brown]] played in 32 matches, including all 3 Tests, scoring 285 points, at the time the greatest number ever attained by an Australian player on tour.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | title = Dave Brown Retires\n  |work=The Sydney Morning Herald\n  | place = Australia\n  | page = 4\n  | language =\n  | publisher=\n  | date = 14 April 1941\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=x4UQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=apUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6144,5097866\n  | accessdate = 1 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAn exhibition match between Australia and Great Britain at Paris' [[Stade Pershing]] in December 1933 inspired the beginnings of [[rugby league in France]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lyle |first=Beaton |title=75 Years of French Rugby League |url=http://www.rleague.com/content/article.php?id=32875 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908091158/http://www.rleague.com/content/article.php?id=32875 |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 September 2012 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |newspaper=rleague.com |date=7 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===1940s===\n[[Albert Johnston (rugby league)|Albert Johnston]] was a national selector in 1946 and coach of the national side for the 1946 first post-WWII Anglo-Australian series.\nAustralia's [[1948-49 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]] was their seventh tour to the UK. They played the [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes series]] against a side officially called Great Britain.\n\n===1950s===\n\nDuring the [[1951 French rugby league tour of Australia and New Zealand]], Australia lost the three-Test series to the powerful French team inspired by their freakish goal kicking fullback [[Puig Aubert]].\n\nThe [[1954 Rugby League World Cup]] was the first such tournament held in either rugby code. Australia failed to reach the final.\n\nFor the [[1956\u201357 Kangaroo tour]] a record eleven Queenslanders were selected in the touring squad. Great Britain defeated Australia 19\u20130 at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]], [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]], to take [[The Ashes (rugby league)|the Ashes]] series 2\u20131.\n\nAustralia hosted and won the [[1957 Rugby League World Cup|1957 World Cup]].\n\nFor the [[1959\u201360 Kangaroo tour]] of Great Britain, the home nation retained the Ashes by winning the Test series 2\u20131 by the following results.\n\n* First Test \u2013 Great Britain 14\u201322 Australia at Station Road, Swinton.\n* Second Test \u2013 Great Britain 11\u201310 Australia at [[Headingley Carnegie Rugby Stadium|Headingley]], [[Leeds]].\n* Third Test \u2013 Great Britain 18\u201312 Australia at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]], [[Wigan]].\n\nThis was the last British Ashes win on home soil.\n\n===1960s===\nFor the [[1960 Rugby League World Cup|1960 World Cup]] no final was held, but the last game, which was between the previously undefeated [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and Australia sides, made it the tournament decider. Great Britain won 10\u20133.\n\n[[Harry Bath]] was selected manager, coach and as the sole selector for the Australian national team's 1962 Ashes series.\n\nAfter ten previous tours of Britain, the [[1963-64 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1963\u201364 Kangaroo tour]] saw Australia's first ever Ashes victory on British soil. The [[Arthur Summons]] coached Kangaroos won the first test at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] before rampaging to a famous 50\u201312 win in the second test at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]] in [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]]. Although they lost the third test at Headingley, legendary winger [[Ken Irvine]] became the first Australian player to score a try in each test of an Ashes series. The Kangaroos have not lost a series in Britain since.<ref>{{cite web|last=sahof.org.au|title=Kangaroos Team (Rugby League) \u2013 1963|url=http://www.sahof.org.au/awards/member-profile/?teamAwardID=10|work=Team Sport Australia Award|publisher=Sport Australia Hall of Fame|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nHarry Bath coached the national side to World Cup glory in the [[1968 Rugby League World Cup|1968 World Cup]]. He also coached the team on a tour of New Zealand in 1969.\n\n===1970s===\nThe last time that Great Britain won the Ashes was in 1970. They won the series 2\u20131 in Australia. Out of 24 games played Great Britain won 22, drew one and lost one \u2013 making them the most successful British tourists so far. The 1970 Lions contained a galaxy of stars including captain [[Frank Myler]], [[Roger Millward]], [[Cliff Watson]] and [[Mal Reilly]]. Future Kangaroo Tour captain and later coach [[Bob Fulton]] made his test debut in the 1970 Ashes series (Fulton had actually played 3 games for Australia in the 1968 World Cup but at the time tests and World Cup games were classed differently). Harry Bath again coached Australia to victory in the [[1970 Rugby League World Cup|1970 World Cup Final]] in a brutal game that became known as the \"Battle of Headingley\". Bath also coached the team on a tour of New Zealand in 1971. On that tour [[Geoff Starling]] became the youngest player to ever represent Australia. He was 18 years and 181 days old when playing a tour match against a New Zealand XIII at [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Ritchie|first=Dean|title=Folau the youngest Roo|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/league/folau-the-youngest-roo/story-e6frf3ou-1111114570135|accessdate=2 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=5 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nAustralia lost the [[1972 World Cup]] [[1972 Rugby League World Cup Final|Final]] to Great Britain in controversial circumstances. Australian captain [[Graeme Langlands]] was denied what seemed a fair try by being ruled offside by the French referee after catching a kick put up by halfback [[Dennis Ward (rugby league)|Dennis Ward]]. Television footage of the try showed Langlands was approximately a metre behind Ward when he kicked the ball. The French referee Georges Jameau's alleged reason for not awarding the try was that he did not believe anyone could have scored it from an onside position. The World Cup final was tied at 10\u201310 after full-time and was still locked after extra time. Great Britain were awarded the victory due to a higher points table placing after the pool rounds of the competition. The Final was also highlighted by an 80-metre try to Lions captain, winger [[Clive Sullivan]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6QneX1iBrI 1972 World Cup Final highlights]</ref>\n\nOn the [[1978 Kangaroo tour]], Great Britain defeated Australia in the second test at Bradford, 18\u201314, before a crowd of 26,447. It took ten years, and fifteen consecutive test defeats before Britain were able to defeat the Kangaroos again, starting with Australia's 3\u20130 whitewash of the Lions during their 1979 Australasian tour. The Kangaroos had already won the first test 15\u20139 at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Wigan]] and wrapped up the series with a 23\u20136 win in the third test at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium|Headingley]]. However, the Australians were surprisingly defeated by the French team in both tests played at the end of the 1978 tour. This was the last defeat of the Kangaroos in a series until 2005.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s was the decade in which Australia began to truly dominate world rugby league. Along with the emergence of [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] football came a new crop of superstar players who led Australia throughout the 1980s. Players such as [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]], [[Mal Meninga]], [[Wayne Pearce]], [[Brett Kenny]], [[Eric Grothe, Sr.|Eric Grothe]] and [[Wally Lewis]] came to prominence on the [[1982 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]]. Australia's performance was taken into a new dimension by the tourists, also known as '[[The Invincibles (Rugby League)|the Invincibles]]', when they became the first team to win every game of the tour (fifteen games) including the first test by 40\u20134 at Hull in front of 26,771 spectators. After the extremely poor showing during their 1979 Australasian tour, the Kangaroos rammed home just how far behind British football had fallen at [[Boothferry Park]]. The score was only 10\u20134 at half time, but after the break Australia's superior fitness showed and they ran in six unanswered tries to leave the crowd and British football stunned.\n\nIn 1983, [[Arthur Beetson]] became the first Aboriginal to coach the Australian team after [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]] had stood down following the Kangaroo Tour. Although Australia won the first test against New Zealand at [[Carlaw Park]] in [[Auckland]], the Kiwis shocked by winning the return match 19\u201312 at Lang Park.\n\nWhen the Lions toured in 1984, The Kangaroos again swept The Ashes series 3\u20130 under new team captain Wally Lewis, the first Queenslander to captain Australia since Arthur Beetson in 1974. Beetson was replaced as coach in 1984 by a returning Frank Stanton.\n\nIn 1985, Australia made a [[1985 Kangaroo tour of New Zealand|six-match tour]] of New Zealand under the coaching of [[Terry Fearnley]] who prior to the tour had coached NSW to its first ever [[1985 State of Origin series|Origin series]] win over Qld (the tour actually took place between games 2 and 3 of the Origin series). The Kangaroos won five of those matches, and the Test series 2\u20131. Australia won the first Test in Brisbane 26\u201320. On Sunday 30 June 1985, Australia met New Zealand in the second Test at [[Carlaw Park]], [[Auckland]]. The Test was a 20,000 sell-out, with all tickets accounted for weeks before the match. The Kiwis dominated long periods of the game but ninety seconds from time the Kiwis lost possession close to half way. [[John Ribot]] scored a try and Australia won 10\u20136. The tour ended in acrimony as tensions between coach Fearley and the Qld players, led by team captain Wally Lewis, reached boiling point with Lewis publicly stating that he had caught Fearnley and team vice-captain Wayne Pearce going over team selections in Fearnley's hotel room, though both Fearnley and Pearce denied the allegations. After the second test win Fearnley made 4 changes to the test team for the third and final test at Carlaw Park with all four players who were omitted being Queenslanders. The changes proved disastrous and NZ ran out easy 18\u20130 winners.\n\nFollowing the tour, the Australian Rugby League decided that from then on the Kangaroos coach could not also double as the incumbent coach of either NSW or Qld.\n\nFormer Kangaroo [[Don Furner]] became Australian coach in 1986 and immediately formed a good working relationship with Wally Lewis and the players. The now harmonious Australians swept New Zealand 3\u20130 in a [[1986 Trans-Tasman Test series|mid-season test series]] played in Australia.\n\nDuring the [[1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]] a then record northern hemisphere crowd of 50,383 attended the first test of the Ashes series at [[Old Trafford]] with the Walle Lewis led Australians winning 38\u201316. On 16 December 1986 the Kangaroos set a new record for largest-ever winning margin in a Test match at 52\u20130 against [[France national rugby league team|France]].

After suffering such heavy losses, France decided to call off their proposed 1987 tour of Australia. This became the second consecutive tour of Europe in which Australia had won all their games. By the end of the tour, [[Terry Lamb]] had become the first player to appear in every match on a Kangaroo Tour. For this tour Wally Lewis, [[Greg Dowling]], [[Bob Lindner]], [[Gene Miles]] ([[Wynnum Manly Seagulls|Wynnum Manly]]) and [[Bryan Neibling]] ([[Redcliffe Dolphins|Redcliffe]]) became the last players selected to tour from the [[Brisbane Rugby League]] competition. By being named as tour captain, Wally Lewis became the first Queenslander to captain a Kangaroo Tour since [[Tom Gorman (rugby league)|Tom Gorman]] in 1929/30.\n\nAustralia crashed to a defeat on Tuesday 21 July 1987, when the Kangaroo dominance of the international game suffered a setback. New Zealand were their opponents in a match at Lang Park which had been arranged to fill the gap created by the non-appearance of France. New Zealand won the game 13\u20136. The next four internationals between Australia and New Zealand were all staged in New Zealand, and all were won by the Kangaroos.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/australia-vs-new-zealand-1987/australia-vs-new-zealand.html 1987 Australia vs New Zealand at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour]] the Ashes were successfully retained by Australia by winning the first two Tests, however Great Britain won the third test 26\u201312 at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]], ending a 15-game winning streak between the two teams that stretched back to the third Ashes test of 1978. Later that month, Australia's 62-point win over [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] in the NSW country town of [[Wagga Wagga]] set a new record for largest winning margin in international rugby league. Australian dual international winger [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]] also set a new record for most points scored by an individual in international rugby league (30 points \u2013 4 tries, 7 goals).<ref>{{cite news|title=O'Connor helps set Test records|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r3BVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fpYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3512,275171|accessdate=18 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=21 July 1988}}</ref> Also in 1988, as part of the [[Australian bicentenary|bicentenary celebrations]], Australia played a one off test match against Rest Of The World at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]], winning the one off test 22-10.

Fulton's first series in charge of the Australian team saw them sweep New Zealand 3\u20130 during their 1989 tour.\n\n===1990s===\nThe Bob Fulton coached Kangaroos played two mid-season tests in 1990.

The Ashes got off to a bad start for the Kangaroos when Great Britain shocked Australia to win the first test 19\u201312 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in front of a new record home crowd of 54,567. The second test at Old Trafford in [[Manchester]] was a tight, thrilling affair that saw two of the most famous tries scored in test match football. Debutante 5/8 [[Cliff Lyons]] second half try came after the Kangaroos kept the ball alive through 13 sets of hands before winger [[Andrew Ettingshausen]] raced down the wing and centre kicked for Lyons to score. With the scores tied at 10-all going into injury time and the Kangaroos pinned just 15 metres from their line, [[Ricky Stuart]] set off on a 75-metre run before passing to Meninga for the winning try only seconds from full-time to give Australia a 14\u201310 win.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11y0Sk7EoDU 1990 Great Britain vs Australia \u2013 Mal Meninga 2nd Test try]</ref> The Kangaroos then wrapped up The Ashes with a comprehensive 14\u20130 win in the third test at Elland Road in Leeds. Meninga as captain became just the third Australian (after [[Ken Irvine]] in 1962 and 1963\u201364, and [[Sam Backo]] in 1988) to score a try in each test of an Ashes series.\n\nAustralia faced New Zealand in a three-game [[1991 Trans-Tasman Test series|mid-season Test series]] in 1991. The first test, played at the [[Olympic Park Stadium]] in [[Melbourne]] (the first rugby league test played in Australia outside of NSW or Qld) saw the Kiwis again defeat Australia after a successful Kangaroo tour. NZ won the first test 24\u20138 in Melbourne in front of 26,900 fans, however a new look Australian side came back to win the second test 44\u20130 in Sydney and the third test 40\u201312 in Brisbane.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/australia-vs-new-zealand-1991/summary.html 1991 Australia vs New Zealand at Rugby League Project]</ref> At the end of the [[1991 NSWRL season]], the Kangaroos embarked on their first (and as of 2017 only) [[1991 Kangaroo tour of Papua New Guinea|tour of]] [[Papua New Guinea]], winning all five games on tour including easily both tests against the Papua New Guinea Kumuls.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/tours/kangaroos-tour-1991/summary.html 1991 Kangaroo tour of Papua New Guinea]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia]], the British lost the first test 22\u20136 in Sydney before stunning the Australians when they easily won the 2nd Ashes test 33\u201310 at [[Princes Park (stadium)|Princes Park]] in Melbourne, but lost the 3rd test 16\u201310 in Brisbane. The [[1992 Rugby League World Cup final]] at Wembley Stadium set a then international attendance record for a rugby league international of 73,631. The Bob Fulton coached, Mal Meninga captained Australians defeat Great Britain 10\u20136 to win their 7th [[Rugby League World Cup]] title. The WCF was a tight game with the Lions leading 6\u20134 with less than 20 minutes remaining before an on debut [[Steve Renouf]] crossed for the only try of the game and along with Meninga's sideline conversion gave the Kangaroos a famous victory.<ref name=\"rugbyleagueproject1989\">[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-cup-1989/final/great-britain-vs-australia.html 1992 World Cup Final at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\nAustralia again played a [[1993 Trans-Tasman Test series|mid-season test series]] against New Zealand in 1993. The first test at the [[Mt Smart Stadium]] in Auckland ended in a 14-all draw thanks to a late [[Laurie Daley]] field goal. Daley had captained Australia for the first time in the match following a two-game suspension to Mal Meninga. The Kangaroos then won the second test 16\u20138 at the very wet [[Palmerston North Showgrounds]] before wrapping up the series with a 16\u20134 win at Lang Park in Brisbane.\n\nOn 4 July 1994, Australia defeated France [[1994 French rugby league Oceania tour|58\u20130]] at the [[Parramatta Stadium]] in Sydney, their only test on home soil for the year.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/france-vs-australia-1994/australia-vs-france.html 1994 Australia vs France at Rugby League Project]</ref> The [[1994 Kangaroo Tour]] was the last time the Australian national team played matches against British provincial teams, in addition to the Tests. Australia continued its dominance, winning both Test series against Great Britain and France, suffering only one loss (again, against Great Britain in the First Test at Wembley), and remained undefeated against British club outfits in a streak stretching back to 1978. Australia adopted the name 'Kangaroos' for the July test against France, since then the team has been officially known by this name. The 1994 Kangaroo tour was also the first (and only) time that the traditional Australian test kit was only worn during test matches. For the tour games, including the friendly against Wales in [[Cardiff]] (the first time Australia had played Wales in 12 years), the Kangaroos wore jumpers that had increasing thickness gold hoops underneath the twin gold chevrons.\n\nThe Australian team that contested and won the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup]] consisted only of players from clubs that remained loyal to the Australian Rugby League during the [[Super League war]]. This meant several players from Super League-aligned clubs that were already well-established internationals were not selected for the World Cup squad. During 1995, the Kangaroos defeated New Zealand 3\u20130 in the [[1995 Trans-Tasman Test series|Trans-Tasman Test series]] played in Australia. As they were for the World Cup, only ARL loyal players were selected for Australia which saw a number of players, including [[Steve Menzies]], [[Mark Coyne (rugby league)|Mark Coyne]], [[Terry Hill]], [[Gary Larson (rugby league)|Gary Larson]], [[Trevor Gillmeister]] and [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] make their test debuts during the New Zealand series. Despite having what many described as a second string side without players such as Laurie Daley, [[Allan Langer]], [[Andrew Ettingshausen]], [[Brett Mullins]], [[Glenn Lazarus]], [[Bradley Clyde]], [[Ian Roberts (rugby league)|Ian Roberts]], [[Ricky Stuart]] and [[Steve Walters]], Bob Fulton's Kangaroos won their 8th World Cup (and 5th in a row) when they defeated England 16\u20138 in the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] in front of 66,540 fans at Wembley. The star of the day for Australia was halfback/hooker [[Andrew Johns]].\n\nIn 1997 also, due to the [[Super League war]], Australian rugby league was split down the middle by two competitions: the ARL's [[Optus Cup]] and Super League's [[Telstra Cup]].

There was no tournament this year due to the fact that there was a World Cup next year for the teams to prepare for.\n\nAustralia began the 2013 International season by retaining the Bill Kelly Memorial Trophy after another [[2013 Anzac Test|Anzac Test]] win. At the end of the year, Australia traveled up to play in the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup|2013 World Cup]] co-hosted by England and Wales. In their opening game against England, the Kangaroos were surprisingly facing a 0\u201310 scoreline after twenty minutes. But Australia went on to regain the control and go on to win the match by eight points. The England match was Australia's only 'scare' in the tournament as the Kangaroos went on to win and dominate all of their remaining matches, recording a 244\u20134 total aggregate score. They went on to earn revenge for their defeat to New Zealand five years ago in the World Cup final to beat them this time around at the same stage. The final was watched in front of a record International rugby league attendance of 74,468 and in the match, five-eighth, [[Johnathan Thurston]] broke Mick Cronin's 31-year record of top point scorer after a conversion took him past the previous record of 309 points. This was the Kangaroos' tenth World Cup title.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = VIDEO: All tries (34\u20132) Kangaroos V Kiwis, Rugby League World Cup final 2013, Old Trafford\n  | publisher = Newshub.\n  | date = 1 December 2013\n  | url = http://www.newshub.co.nz/sport/video-all-tries-342-kangaroos-v-kiwis-rugby-league-world-cup-final-2013-old-trafford-2013120105#ixzz4GOq2qrbI\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref> After the England game, Australia recorded five successive games without conceding a try in the tournament.

Later that year, Australia co-hosted the [[2014 Rugby League Four Nations|2014 Four Nations]] with New Zealand. They took on the Kiwis in the second of the double-header clashes at Suncorp Stadium. However Australia's record against the Kiwis at the venue continued to be a negative one after another defeat made it three defeats in the past four meetings at the 'Cauldron'. This meant Australia were facing England in a must win game at AAMI Park in Melbourne. With many regulars missing, Sheens had to make decisions like naming an 18-year old in the team, who'd become the youngest player to play for Australia. [[Sione Mata'utia]], aged 18 years and 129 days, eclipsed the previous record held by Israel Folau, since 2007, by 65 days when he played on debut for Australia against the 'Poms'. The match was headlined with controversy. In the last minute of the game, England put a grubber kick in the in-goal area, since they were desperate for a try as they were trailing by just four points. Australian fullback [[Greg Inglis]] had to force the ball dead due to incoming England attack but the video referees wanted to have another look and see whether or not it was Inglis or the incoming English winger Ryan Hall got the last touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays it showed that Ryan Hall's right hand's little finger had put some downward pressure on the ball however in normal speed it was deemed 'inconclusive' by Australian officiating rules and therefore a NO TRY was given to the frustration of the English players and supporters but respect from Sheens and his Australian players. Had the try been awarded and England converted, it would have been Australia's first defeat to England since 1995, the first time they suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1970 and the first time they failed to qualify for a tournament final since 1954.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Four Nations: England denied late try as Australia win in Melbourne\n  | publisher = skySPORTS\n  | date = 2 November 2014\n  | url = http://www.skysports.com/rugby-league/australia-vs-england/41788\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Sheens: England no-try correct decision\n  | publisher = Sportal\n  | date = 2 November 2014\n  | url = http://www.sportal.co.nz/league/news/sheens-england-no-try-correct-decision/1j65r570o24e91t2k4zgow5fm8\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref> In their final round-robin fixture they dominated proceedings against the Samoans, who had been causing trouble for England and New Zealand in the tournament, to advance to the final which was held in New Zealand. However they couldn't get revenge for their defeat earlier in the tournament as Australia lost 18\u201322.\n\nThe [[2015 Anzac Test]] was held in Suncorp Stadium. The Australian team's horrible record in Brisbane against the Kiwis continued as they suffered another defeat and records continued to be made for the New Zealand team. This was the first time they beat Australia for three consecutive test-matches since 1953 and the first time they won the Anzac Test since 1998. Australia did not play another test-match that year.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Anzac Test: Kangaroos say only have one Test in 2015 doesn\u2019t affect importance of representing Australia\n  | publisher = The Courier Mail\n  | date = 29 April 2015\n  | url = http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/anzac-test-kangaroos-say-only-have-one-test-in-2015-doesnt-affect-importance-of-representing-australia/news-story/4a2701ae1d41ddb6d132ef5682d628db\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news \n  | title = NRL must cut season and play more test matches, says former ARL boss Geoff Carr\n  | publisher = stuff sport\n  | date = 5 May 2015\n  | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/68276033/nrl-must-cut-season-and-play-more-test-matches-says-former-arl-boss-geoff-carr\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref>\nAfter the match Sheens was facing scrutiny from the media after many believed it was time for the old players he fielded to move on since the much younger Kiwis side had beaten them on the past three occasions. Australia also dropped down to number 2 on the [[RLIF World Rankings]], which added further scrutiny. At the end of the year, Sheens was unable to cope with the pressure of the media, despite wanting to coach the team at the 2017 World Cup. He took up an advisory role with English domestic club Salford Red Devils and therefore resigned as coach of the Australian national team.\n\nIn December 2015, successful Queensland Maroons coach [[Mal Meninga]] announced he'd leave his role as the coach of the Queensland representative side to coach the Australian national team. Before his appointment Mal announced his ambitions that he wanted the International game to become the pinnacle of rugby league like it was in his playing days.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = League: Mal Meninga wants international football restored as pinnacle of the game\n  | newspaper = The Telegraph\n  | date = 20 November 2015\n  | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11548650\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nMal Meninga's first game in charge as Australian coach was the [[2016 Anzac Test]]. Prior to the test, Meninga stirred controversy around the rugby league world after selecting Fijian born player [[Semi Radradra]], who is eligible due to living in Australia for three years, in his team over other 'homegrown' Australian players. Radradra, who represented Fiji at the 2013 World Cup, still had a Fijian passport at that time and this brought up the question of changing eligibility rules in International rugby league. Meninga's selection questioned the ambition he raised of wanting to make the International game the pinnacle of the sport. Australia won the test-match 16\u20130 and in the process ended their losing-run against the Kiwis. They also held New Zealand scoreless in a test-match for the first time since 2007. But despite the result Australia suffered criticism with commentator Phil Gould saying the Australian team is 'too old' and are 'kidding themselves if they think they'll win the World Cup next year'. He believes Australia should've put much more points on a 'weakened' New Zealand team missing many regular players through various reasons. Meninga hit back saying 'That was a real test-match. That's what test footy is. People who have never played it don't know what it is.'<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Meninga defends victorious Kangaroos after 'rugged' win over Kiwis\n  | publisher = Kiama Independent\n  | date = 7 May 2016\n  | url = http://www.kiamaindependent.com.au/story/3893636/meninga-defends-victorious-kangaroos-after-rugged-win-over-kiwis-photos/?cs=2452\n  | accessdate = 5 August 2016}}</ref> \nAt the conclusion of the 2016 domestic season, Australia took on New Zealand in Perth in what was the first ever [[2016 Rugby League Four Nations#Australia vs New Zealand|test-match]] in Western Australia. Meninga's men then began their [[2016 Rugby League Four Nations|2016 Four Nations]] campaign with comfortable 42-point win over Scotland, in the first ever meeting between the two countries. After a tough encounter with New Zealand, and a convincing win over England, Australia met their Trans-Tasman rivals once again in the final. Meninga's Roos made the final tournament match look easy, as the Kangaroos dominated their opponents with a 26-point victory, claiming their third tournament title in the process.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Australia 34-8 New Zealand: Mal Meninga's ruthless side storm to victory in Four Nations final at Anfield\n  | publisher = Daily Mail Australia\n  | date = 21 November 2016\n  | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/article-3954908/Australia-34-8-New-Zealand-Mal-Meninga-s-ruthless-storm-victory-Four-Nations-final-Anfield.html\n  | accessdate = 5 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the last ever scheduled [[2017 Anzac Test|Anzac Test]], captain [[Cameron Smith]] became just the second player to play 50 tests for Australia, behind former captain, and record cap holder, [[Darren Lockyer]].

Later in the year, countries were preparing for the grandest stage in the international game, the [[2017 Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]]. However, the biggest talking point wasn't about whether Australia would defend their title. It was around Tonga, after many players of Tongan heritage, had quit the opportunity to represent the New Zealand squad in order to play for Tonga. Regular Australian prop forward, [[Andrew Fifita]], also followed suit, after initially being announced in Meninga's squad, to the disapproval of Australian halfback [[Cooper Cronk]].<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Kangaroos star Cooper Cronk labels Andrew Fifita's late defection to Tonga as 'poor'\n  | publisher = stuff sport\n  | date = 6 October 2017\n  | url = https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/97610160/Kangaroos-star-Cooper-Cronk-labels-Andrew-Fifitas-late-defection-to-Tonga-as-poor\n  | accessdate = 5 December 2017}}</ref> Meninga, however, also voiced his opinion saying he had no issue with Fifita's decision, as it was great for Tonga, and the international game. After conceding early, Australia went on to grit out a tough victory over England. The Kangaroos then went on to beat a spirited French team, in a game which saw [[Wade Graham]] became the seventh player to equal the record of four tries in a World Cup game, and only the second Australian forward to score four tries in a single game, since Gorden Tallis in 2000.<ref>{{cite news \n  | title = Australia 52-6 France: Wade Graham scores four tries on just his second appearance as Kangaroos record emphatic victory in World Cup clash\n  | publisher = Daily Mail Australia\n  | date = 3 November 2017\n  | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/article-5046457/Australia-52-6-France-Wade-Graham-scores-four-tries.html\n  | accessdate = 5 December 2017}}</ref> Australia finished off their pool stage games, with a comprehensive victory over a gallant Lebanese outfit.

Australia also became the first team to win 11 World Cup crowns. The final score of 6\u20130, made this the lowest scoring World Cup final in the history of the tournament.

When playing in Australia the team wore sky-blue or maroon, depending on whether they were playing in New South Wales or Queensland. On tours, Australia wore either the sky blue of New South Wales (as the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] organised the tours) or a maroon and sky blue hooped design.\n\nIn 1924 the decision was taken to change the national jersey's colours to green and gold. A green jersey with gold bands was used for Australia's next Test series in 1928, making the 1928 Kangaroos the first Australian representative rugby league team to adopt these colours. This design was revived for 25 July 2003 Test against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]]. In 1929 the current design, which is green with two gold chevrons, was adopted and first used.\n\nIn 1997 during the [[Super League war]], the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] only Australian team wore a green shirt with a blue and yellow chevron for the [[1997 Anzac Test|Anzac Test]] against New Zealand and the [[Super League Test series]] against Great Britain. In their only game that year, the ARL Australian team wore the traditional kit for their one-game against a Rest of the World team made up of international players with ARL contracts.\n\nThe original blue and maroon broken striped design was revived in 1963 when Australia hosted a touring [[South Africa national rugby league team|South African rugby league team]] who also wore a predominantly green jumper with gold trim,<ref>{{Cite news\n  | last = Clarkson\n  | first = Alan\n  | title = Historic Jerseys for Aust.

They replaced [[Classic Sportswear|Classic]] who lasted between late 1999 to 2012. Canterbury had also supplied the kits during the mid-1990s while Classic had supplied the kits from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. Other suppliers were [[Adidas]] (1978-1982), [[Classic Sportswear]] (1983-1991, 1993-1997), [[Umbro]] (1992) and [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] (1997 - SL).\n\nThe 1994 Kangaroo tour saw the introduction of a special 'tour games only' jersey, leaving the traditional kit for test matches. The jersey was essentially the same though gold hoops of increasing thickness were added to the jumper below the traditional gold chevrons. The 1994 tour was the only time this jersey was used. This had followed on from the idea of using a different jersey for non-test games on a tour that was started in 1992 when Australia was in England for the [[1992 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]]. The Kangaroos played three warm up games against [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]], [[Sheffield Eagles (1984)|Sheffield]] and [[Cumbria rugby league team|Cumbria]] wearing a predominantly white jersey with large green and gold diamonds in the shape of kit supplier Umbro.\n\n{|\n|{{Football kit

indigenous contribution to the Kangaroos is unmatched in Australian national sporting teams.\n\nBy way of example, Lionel Morgan was the first indigenous player in any Australian national sporting team in 1960, while Arthur Beetson was the first indigenous captain of any Australian national sporting team in 1973 when he captained the team in the final game of the [[1973 Kangaroo tour]], the second test against [[France national rugby league team|France]] at the [[Stade des Minimes]] in [[Toulouse]] on 16 December. Australia won the game 14\u20133.\n\nRemarkably given the 2% indigenous rate of population in Australia, the Kangaroos fielded a run-on team against New Zealand in the [[2015 Anzac Test]] with 7 of the 13 players having indigenous heritage (a staggering 54%). This contrasts markedly to nearly every other Australian national sporting team as at 2015.\n\n===War cry===\nFrom 1908 to 1967, the Australian team performed a war cry before Tests played in Great Britain and France. The war cry was first performed when the Kangaroos arrived at [[Tilbury]] Docks near London. It was developed after war cries had been performed on tours of Britain by the New Zealand [[All Blacks]] in 1905, the South African [[Springboks]] in 1906 and the New Zealand [[1907-1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Great Britain|All Golds]] in 1907. It is believed that the war cry is derived from an indigenous chant on [[Stradbroke Island]], Queensland, Australia.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/26/1059084220273.html \tFor crying out loud, where's Australia's war song?]</ref>\n\n[[File:GB_v_AUS_09-11-1963_at_Station_Road_1.jpg|right|thumb|The Kangaroos performing the war cry prior to the [[1963\u201364 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|test against Great Britain in 1963]]  at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]].]]\n{| cellpadding=6\n|-\n!
