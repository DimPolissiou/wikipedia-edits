Denmark'' (2006). Therefore, closed shops are illegal under Article 11 of the Convention.\n\n====United Kingdom====\nDunn and Gennard found 111 UK cases of dismissals on the introduction of a closed shop, involving 325 individuals,<ref name=Dunn>{{Cite book|author=Dunn, Stephen |author2=Gennard, John |title=The Closed Shop on British Industry|publisher=Macmillan |location=London and Basingstoke |year=1984 |isbn=0-333-26203-4}}</ref>{{rp|125}} and they stated, \"While proponents of the closed shop may argue that an estimated minimum 325 dismissals is a relatively small number compared with the total population covered by closed shops, critics would see the figure as substantial arguing that one dismissal is one too many\".<ref name=Dunn/>{{rp|126}} In relation to the pre-entry closed shop, they stated, \"Its ''raison d'\u00eatre'' is to exclude people from jobs by denying them union membership\".<ref name=Dunn/>{{rp|132}} \n \nAll forms of closed shops in the UK are illegal following the introduction of the [[Employment Act 1990]]. They were further curtailed under section 137(1)(a) of the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]] (c. 52)<ref>http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1992/ukpga_19920052_en_9#pt3-pb1-l1g137</ref> passed by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government at the time. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], then in opposition, had supported closed shops until December 1989, when it abandoned the policy in accordance with European legislation.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/18/newsid_2538000/2538439.stm | work=BBC News | title=1989: Labour's union U-turn | date=18 December 1989}}</ref> However, Labour shadow arts minister [[Thangam Debbonaire]] announced to an [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] conference in May 2016 that she favoured the introduction of a \"limited\" closed shop for actors, as part of [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s pledge to strengthen and introduce a new package of employment rights beneficial to employees.<ref name=MS>{{cite news|last1=Landin|first1=Conrad|title=Equity: Closed shop 'way forward for arts'|url=https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-bf65-Equity-Closed-shop-way-forward-for-arts|accessdate=28 May 2016|work=Morning Star|date=24 May 2016|location=Bristol|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630023255/https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-bf65-Equity-Closed-shop-way-forward-for-arts|archive-date=30 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Equity was one of the last trade unions in the United Kingdom to offer a pre-entry closed shop until the 1990 act.<ref name=MS />\n\nThe famous [[English tort law]] case of [[Rookes v Barnard|Rookes v.

The [[union shop]] was ruled illegal by the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"Pattern Makers v. NLRB\">{{Cite web  |title = Pattern Makers v.

An employer may not lawfully agree with a union to hire only union members, but it may agree to require employees to join the union or pay the equivalent of union dues to it within a set period after starting employment. Similarly, a union could require an employer that had agreed to a closed shop contract prior to 1947 to fire an employee who had been expelled from the union for any reason, but it cannot demand an employer to fire an employee under a union shop contract for any reason other than failure to pay dues that are required by all employees.\n\nThe US government does not permit the union shop in any federal agency, regardless of state law allowing for such.\n\nConstruction unions and unions in other industries with similar employment patterns have coped with the prohibition of closed shops by using exclusive [[hiring hall]]s as a means of controlling the supply of labor. Such exclusive hiring halls do not, strictly and formally require union membership as a condition of employment, but they do so in practical terms since an employee seeking to be dispatched to work through the union's hiring hall must pay union dues or a roughly-equivalent hiring hall fee. If the hiring hall is run on a non-discriminatory basis and adheres to clearly-stated eligibility and dispatch standards, it is lawful.\n\nThe Taft\u2013Hartley Act also bars unions from requiring unreasonably-high initiation fees as a condition of membership to prevent unions from using initiation fees as a device to keep non-union employees out of a particular industry. Also, the National Labor Relations Act permits construction employers to enter pre-hire agreements in which they agree to draw their workforces from a pool of employees dispatched by the union. The NLRA prohibits pre-hire agreements outside the construction industry.<ref>29 USCA 158.</ref>\n\nFor the [[entertainment industry]], unions representing performers have as their most important rule banning any represented performer from working on any non-union production. Penalties are imposed on the union member, not the employer, and can lead to loss of union membership. Most major productions are union productions, and nonmembers join the [[Screen Actors Guild]] by performing as [[extra (actor)|extras]] and earning three union vouchers or by being given a speaking line and entering that way. The other performance unions do not have minimum membership standards, but those who join them are barred one from working on non-union productions.\n\nAll four major sports leagues are union shops{{fact|date=March 2015}} even though a franchise may be located in a state that has a right-to-work law or constitutional provision.\n\n===Canada===\nThe status of closed shops varies from province to province within Canada.

Denmark'' (2006).

They were further curtailed under section 137(1)(a) of the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]] (c. 52)<ref>http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1992/ukpga_19920052_en_9#pt3-pb1-l1g137</ref> passed by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government at the time.

An employer may not lawfully agree with a union to hire only union members, but it may agree to require employees to join the union or pay the equivalent of union dues to it within a set period after starting employment. Similarly, a union could require an employer that had agreed to a closed shop contract prior to 1947 to fire an employee who had been expelled from the union for any reason, but it cannot demand an employer to fire an employee under a union shop contract for any reason other than failure to pay dues that are required by all employees.\n\nThe US government does not permit the union shop in any federal agency, regardless of state law allowing for such.\n\nConstruction unions and unions in other industries with similar employment patterns have coped with the prohibition of closed shops by using exclusive [[hiring hall]]s as a means of controlling the supply of labor. Such exclusive hiring halls do not, strictly and formally require union membership as a condition of employment, but they do so in practical terms since an employee seeking to be dispatched to work through the union's hiring hall must pay union dues or a roughly-equivalent hiring hall fee. If the hiring hall is run on a non-discriminatory basis and adheres to clearly-stated eligibility and dispatch standards, it is lawful.\n\nThe Taft\u2013Hartley Act also bars unions from requiring unreasonably-high initiation fees as a condition of membership to prevent unions from using initiation fees as a device to keep non-union employees out of a particular industry. Also, the National Labor Relations Act permits construction employers to enter pre-hire agreements in which they agree to draw their workforces from a pool of employees dispatched by the union. The NLRA prohibits pre-hire agreements outside the construction industry.<ref>29 USCA 158</ref>\n\nFor the [[entertainment industry]], unions representing performers have as their most important rule banning any represented performer from working on any non-union production. Penalties are imposed on the union member, not the employer, and can lead to loss of union membership. Most major productions are union productions, and nonmembers join the [[Screen Actors Guild]] by performing as [[extra (actor)|extras]] and earning three union vouchers or by being given a speaking line and entering that way. The other performance unions do not have minimum membership standards, but those who join them are barred one from working on non-union productions.\n\nAll four major sports leagues are union shops{{fact|date=March 2015}} even though a franchise may be located in a state that has a right-to-work law or constitutional provision.\n\n===Canada===\nThe status of closed shops varies from province to province within Canada. The [[Canadian Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] has ruled that [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section Two]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] guaranteed both the freedom to associate and the freedom not to associate, but employees in a work-environment largely dominated by a union were beneficiaries of union policies and so should pay union fees, regardless of membership status.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking.

The U.S. then reduced bilateral assistance and terminated a small military training program.

This cross-border [[humanitarian assistance]] program aimed at increasing Afghan self-sufficiency and helping resist Soviet attempts to drive civilians out of the rebel-dominated countryside. During the period of Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the U.S. provided about 3&nbsp;billion [[US dollars]] in military and economic assistance to the [[Mujahideen]] groups stationed on the Pakistani side of the [[Durand Line]].

Co-administration of alpha-1 inhibitor can cause hypotension.<ref name=\"RxList\"/><ref name=\"Roehrborn 55\u201363; discussion 63\u201364\"/>\n\nSince alpha-1 blockers may cause [[orthostatic hypotension]], co-administration with antihypertensives and [[Vasodilation|vasodilators]] must be evaluated with regards to risk-benefit as the risk for low blood pressure is greatly increased.\n\nBy reducing \u03b1<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic activity of the blood vessels, these drugs may cause [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure) and interrupt the [[baroreflex]] response.  In doing so, they may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting when rising from a lying or sitting posture (known as [[orthostatic hypotension]] or postural hypotension).  For this reason, it is generally recommended that alpha blockers should be taken at bedtime.  Additionally, the risk of [[first dose phenomenon]] may be reduced by starting at a low dose and [[titrate|titrating]] upwards as needed.\n\nBecause these medications may cause orthostatic hypotension, as well as [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] in general, these agents may [[drug interaction|interact]] with other medications that increase risk for low blood pressure, such as other [[antihypertensive]]s and [[vasodilator]]s.\n\nAs discussed above, tamsulosin may have less risk for low blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension due to its selectivity for \u03b1<sub>1a</sub>-adrenergic receptors. On the other hand, the drug (a) elevates risk for floppy iris syndrome, and (b) might show adverse drug reactions (ADRs) characteristic of the [[sulfa]] related drugs.\n\n==List of alpha-1 blockers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Alpha-1 inhibitor\n!Structure\n!Use\n!Brand name\n!Selectivity\n|-\n!Prazosin\n|<gallery>\nFile:Prazosin.svg|\n</gallery>\n|Hypertension, PTSD and nightmares\n|Minipress, Vasoflex,  Lentopres and Hypovase.\n|Alpha-1\n|-\n!Terazosin\n|<gallery>\nFile:Terazosin.jpg|\n</gallery>\n|Hypertension and BPH\n|Hytrin, Zaysel and Terazosin\n|Alpha-1\n|-\n!Doxazosin\n|<gallery>\nFile:Doxazosin.svg|\n</gallery>\n|Hypertension and BPH\n|Cardura and Carduran\n|Alpha-1\n|-\n!Silodosin\n|<gallery>\nFile:Silodosin.png|\n</gallery>\n|BPH\n|Rapaflo, Silodyx, Rapilif,  Urief, Trupas, Urorec\n|Alpha-1a\n|-\n!Alfuzosin\n|<gallery>\nFile:Alfuzosin.jpg|\n</gallery>\n|BPH\n|Uroxatral, Xat, Xatral,  Prostetrol and Alfural.\n|Alpha-1a\n|-\n!Tamsulosin\n|<gallery>\nFile:Tamsulosin.svg|\n</gallery>\n|BPH\n|Alna, Flomax, Omnic\n|Alpha-1a\n|}\nSilodosin shows high affinity and selectivity for alpha-1a adrenergic receptors found in the prostate which ensures that it works quickly and effectively to relieve the symptoms of BPH.

The [[Rallying|rally]] team, established at [[Bois de Boulogne]] near [[Paris]],<ref>http://www.juwra.com/peugeot_season_1984.html</ref> debuted its [[Group B]] [[Peugeot 205 Turbo 16]] in the [[1984 World Rally Championship|1984 season]], and took its first victory in [[Rally Finland]] in the hands of [[Ari Vatanen]]. In the [[1985 World Rally Championship|1985 season]], Peugeot drivers Vatanen and [[Timo Salonen]] won seven out of the 12 rounds to give Peugeot its first manufacturers' title and Salonen the drivers' title. Vatanen had been seriously injured in an accident in Argentina in 1985, so was replaced by [[Juha Kankkunen]] for the [[1986 World Rally Championship|1986 season]], who promptly delivered the team the second consecutive title. The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] banned Group B cars for the [[1987 World Rally Championship|1987 season]] after the fatal accident of [[Henri Toivonen]]. This lead Peugeot to switch to [[rally raid]], using the 205 to win the [[Dakar Rally]] for two consecutive years in 1987 to 1988, and then used the [[Peugeot 405|405]] to win in 1989 and 1990. Peugeot Talbot Sport also participated three times at the Pikes Peak Hillclimb Race in 1987, 1988 and 1989, winning the last two years, as well as in 2013 with the 208 T16.\n\n===Move to sportscars===\nIn [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]] Peugeot Talbot Sport established their [[Sports car racing|sportscar]] team at [[V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay]], France <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-warwick-on-top-of-world-1580501.html|title=Motor Racing: Warwick on top of world|publisher=The Independent|date=August 31, 1992|accessdate=March 26, 2010|location=London}}</ref> and in 1988 launched the [[Peugeot 905]] project, to develop a sportscar to begin competing in the [[World Sportscar Championship]] in the [[1991 World Sportscar Championship|1991 season]]. The 905 made its racing debut in the final few races of the [[1990 World Sportscar Championship|1990 season]], and finished second in the 1991 season. In the [[1992 World Sportscar Championship|1992 season]], Peugeot Talbot Sport won the [[1992 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]], with drivers [[Derek Warwick]], [[Yannick Dalmas]] and [[Mark Blundell]]. They also won the 1992 World Sportscar Championship, thanks to Warwick, Dalmas, [[Philippe Alliot]] and [[Mauro Baldi]]. The championship did not run in 1993, but Peugeot were able to take a 1\u20132\u20133 finish at the [[1993 24 Hours of Le Mans]], with [[\u00c9ric H\u00e9lary]], [[Christophe Bouchut]] and [[Geoff Brabham]] driving the winning car. Peugeot Talbot Sport subsequently pulled out of sportscar racing. Jean Todt, meanwhile, left Peugeot for [[Scuderia Ferrari]].\n\n===Formula One===\nPeugeot switched to [[Formula One]] for {{f1|1994}}, using a similar [[Formula One French engine manufacturers|3.5L V10 engine]] as found in the 905. This was easily developed to be used by [[McLaren]] in 1994. However, poor reliability led to the relationship ending at the end of 1994 after 8 podiums, zero victories and 17 DNF's. This led to Peugeot supplying [[Jordan Grand Prix]] in {{f1|1995}}, {{f1|1996}}, and {{f1|1997}} with 5 podiums as best results, before supplying the new [[Prost Grand Prix]] team for the {{f1|1998}}, {{f1|1999}} and {{f1|2000}} seasons.  After a pointless 2000 season where poor reliability matched with Prost inability to deliver a competitive chassis, plus having scored no wins since their debut, led to the French marque pulling the plug out of F1.\n\nThe Peugeot engines were bought by an Asian consortium led by former F1 designer [[Enrique Scalabroni]] called [[Asiatech]] and used for two further years (in 2001 for [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] team and in 2002 for [[Minardi]] team). The Asiatech engines were both reliable, powerful and were supplied at zero cost, but its poor driveability led to both teams replacing them in favor of more costly but more capable Cosworth units.\n\n===Touring car racing===\n[[File:Luciano Burti (5797860059).jpg|In 2009 and 2011, Peugeot won the Stock Car V8 championship with Cac\u00e1 Bueno (here Luciano Burti)|thumb]]\n\nPeugeot entered the [[British Touring Car Championship]] in 1992, preparing [[Peugeot 405|405]]'s for former champion [[Robb Gravett]]. The team was run in-house from the company's UK factory in [[Coventry]]. The 405 never won a race despite promising results in its four seasons of competition, before being replaced in 1996 by the [[Peugeot 406|406]]. Unfortunately Peugeot UK did not share any technical data with its European contemporaries, and the BTCC programme suffered. Peugeot handed the works deal to Motor Sport Developments for 1997 and 98, but wins still eluded the team. With spiralling costs in the series, Peugeot withdrew from the BTCC at the end of 1998.\n\nWith his [[Peugeot 406]], [[Laurent A\u00efello]] won the 1997 [[Super Tourenwagen Cup]] season.\n\nThe Peugeot 306 GTi won the prestigious [[Spa 24 hours]] endurance race in 1999 and 2000.\n\nPeugeot won five times the [[Danish Touringcar Championship]], with both the Peugeot 306 -winner in 1999, 2000 and 2001\u2013 and the [[Peugeot 307]] winner in 2002 and 2003.\n\nPeugeot has been racing successfully in the [[Asian Touring Car Series]], winning the 2000, 2001, and 2002 championships with the [[Peugeot 306|Peugeot 306 GTi]].\n\nIn 2001, Peugeot entered three [[BTC-T Peugeot 406 Coup\u00e9|406 Coup\u00e9s]] into the British Touring Car Championship to compete with the dominant [[Vauxhall Astra]] Coup\u00e9s. However, the 406 Coup\u00e9 was not competitive, despite some promise towards the end of the year, notably when Peugeot's Steve Soper led a race only to suffer engine failure in the last few laps. The 406 Coup\u00e9s were retired at the end of the following year and replaced with the [[BTC-T Peugeot 307|307]]\u2014again, uncompetitively\u2014in 2003.\n\nPeugeot has been racing successfully in the [[Stock Car Brasil]] series since 2007 and won the 2008, 2009, and 2011 championships.\n\nIn 2013, the [[Peugeot 208]]GTi won a one-two-three at the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]] endurance race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peugeot.com/en/news/victory-and-hat-trick-of-the-208-gti-peugeot-sport-at-the-nurburgring-24-hour-race|title=Victory and hat-trick of the 208 GTi Peugeot Sport at the N\u00fcrburgring 24 hour race|accessdate=2013-05-23|publisher=Peugeot Sport}}</ref>\n\n===Return to rallying===\n{{Main|Peugeot Sport WRC results}}\n[[File:Mg2 peugeot.jpg|thumb|[[Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm]] driving the [[Peugeot 206 WRC]] to victory at the 2001 [[Rally Finland]].]]\nIn 1999, Peugeot Sport returned to the World Rally Championship with the [[Peugeot 206 WRC]], under the guidance of director [[Corrado Provera]]. The car debuted at the [[Tour de Corse]], with [[Fran\u00e7ois Delecour]] driving one car and [[Gilles Panizzi]] and [[Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm]] sharing the second car over the remaining events. Gr\u00f6nholm finished fourth on the car's third event, [[Rally Finland]], before Panizzi finished second on [[Rallye Sanremo]].\n\nIn 2000, Gr\u00f6nholm gave the car its first victory at [[Rally Sweden]], and followed this up with wins in New Zealand, Finland and Australia on his way to the Drivers\u2019 championship. Panizzi won in Corsica and Sanremo, giving Peugeot the Manufacturers\u2019 championship.\n\nIn 2001, [[Didier Auriol]] joined the team, replacing Delecour as the main driver alongside Gr\u00f6nholm.  Panizzi and [[Harri Rovanper\u00e4]] also drove additional cars for the team on selected events. Rovanper\u00e4 won round two in Sweden, as Gr\u00f6nholm struggled with retirements during the first half of the year. Auriol won in Spain, Gr\u00f6nholm won in Finland, Australia and Great Britain, and Panizzi won in Italy. The team retained their manufacturers\u2019 crown, even though Gr\u00f6nholm was the best placed driver in the drivers\u2019 standings, in fourth place. Rovanper\u00e4 was fifth, Auriol eighth and Panizzi ninth.\n\nFor 2002, the team signed [[Richard Burns]], the 2001 champion, from Subaru, replacing Auriol in the team. Gr\u00f6nholm won round two in Sweden, before Panizzi took back-to-back wins in France and Spain. Gr\u00f6nholm won the next event in Cyprus, before he and Burns were disqualified for a technical infringement in Argentina. Gr\u00f6nholm won again in Finland, while Panizzi won his third event of the year in Italy. Gr\u00f6nholm completed back-to-back victories in New Zealand and Australia to take his second drivers\u2019 title. Burns finished the season fifth, ahead of Panizzi and Rovanper\u00e4 in sixth and seventh. Peugeot were able to take a third consecutive Manufacturers\u2019 title.\n\nThe driver lineup remained the same for 2003, with [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] joining as title sponsor. Gr\u00f6nholm won in Sweden yet again, and took another two wins in New Zealand and Argentina. Panizzi picked up another win in Spain. Poised to rejoin Subaru in 2004, Burns was ruled out of action ahead of the final round of the season in Great Britain, having suffered a blackout while driving to the event. He was replaced for the event and the 2004 season by Belgian [[Freddy Loix]]. Burns finished the season fourth in the standings, ahead of Gr\u00f6nholm in sixth. Peugeot lost its manufacturers crown to [[Citro\u00ebn]].\n\n[[File:Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm - 2004 Monte Carlo Rally.jpg|thumb|[[Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm]] driving the [[Peugeot 307 WRC]] on the 2004 [[Rally Monte Carlo]].]]\nPeugeot introduced a new car for the 2004 season, the [[Peugeot 307 WRC|307 WRC]], which was based upon the coup\u00e9 cabriolets version of the 307 road car. Having originally not been part of the team at the start of the season, Rovanper\u00e4 replaced Loix after two rounds in the team's second car alongside Gr\u00f6nholm, who struggled with the new car initially. He took the team's only victory of the season in Finland, and he finished fifth in the standings at the end of the season. Peugeot finished fourth in the manufacturers\u2019 standings.\n\nFor 2005, Peugeot signed [[Markko M\u00e4rtin]] from Ford to partner Gr\u00f6nholm. Once again, it took until Gr\u00f6nholm won Rally Finland yet again in August for the team to win. Two rallies later, in Great Britain, M\u00e4rtin's co-driver [[Michael Park (co-driver)|Michael Park]] was killed after the pair's 307 WRC left the road. M\u00e4rtin subsequently pulled out of the World Rally Championship. [[Daniel Carlsson (rally driver)|Daniel Carlsson]] and [[Nicolas Bernardi]] both filled in for him during the final four events. Gr\u00f6nholm took a second win of the season in Japan, on his way to third in the standings. Peugeot finished second in the manufacturers\u2019 standings. At the end of 2005, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn withdrew its two teams from the WRC. Citro\u00ebn took a year out to develop a new car and returned in 2007, but Peugeot did not return to the WRC.\n\nPeugeot Sport created the [[Peugeot 207 S2000]], a rally car built to [[Super 2000]] regulations. Peugeot Sport enter the cars, run by [[Kronos Racing]], in the [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]] (IRC). Peugeot drivers [[Enrique Garc\u00eda-Ojeda]], [[Nicolas Vouilloz]] and [[Kris Meeke]] won the IRC drivers' title in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively. It was replaced by [[Peugeot 208|208 T16]], which competes under R5 Regulations.\n\n===Return to sportscars===\n[[File:Peugeot905 evo1ter 1993.jpg|thumb|[[Peugeot 905]] won 2 times the [[24 Heures du Mans]] in 1992 and 1993, and the World Sports Car Championship]]\n[[File:Peugeot 908 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]], 2 times winner of the Intercontinental Le Mans Series]]\nUnder the guidance of new director [[Michel Barge]], Peugeot Sport returned to sportscar racing for 2007, taking on the dominant [[Audi]] with the [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]]. The car made its debut at the [[2007 1000km of Monza]], the opening round of the [[2007 Le Mans Series season]]. The pairing of [[Marc Gen\u00e9]] and [[Nicolas Minassian]] took the car to victory. At the [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans]], [[St\u00e9phane Sarrazin]] took pole position for the team ahead of the Audis. In the race, the #8 car of Sarrazin, [[Pedro Lamy]] and [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]] finished second behind the #1 Audi. After Le Mans, Sarrazin and Lamy took the Le Mans Series title for Peugeot.\n\nAt the [[2008 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Peugeot and Sarrazin once again took pole position, locking out the first three places on the grid. In the race, the trio of cars finished in second, third and fifth. In the Le Mans Series, Peugeot lost out to Audi again, Minassian and Gen\u00e9 finishing in second place.\n\nAt the beginning of 2009, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn made Citro\u00ebn Sport director [[Olivier Quesnel]] the director of Peugeot Sport too. At the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Sarrazin set his third consecutive pole position for the team. In the race, the team delivered its first Le Mans victory since 1993, with the trio of [[David Brabham]], Gen\u00e9 and [[Alexander Wurz]] winning ahead of the car driven by [[Franck Montagny]], Bourdais and Sarrazin. The team's third car finished the race in sixth position. The team only contested one round of the Le Mans Series season, at Spa as preparation for Le Mans itself.\n\nPeugeot scored a 1\u20132 finish at the [[2010 12 Hours of Sebring]]. However, reliability problems for the 908 at the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]] meant that Audi finished 1\u20132\u20133 at the race.\n\nAt the [[2011 12 Hours of Sebring]], the older Peugeot 908 HDi FAP owned by Oreca Racing had a surprise win over the factory 908s and Audi R15++s. At the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Peugeot saw itself in a position to win after two of the Audi R18s crashed; only a strong effort from Audi kept Peugeot from winning the race. The winning Audi was only 13 seconds ahead of the 2nd-place Peugeot 908.\n\nOn January 18, 2012, Peugeot Sport announced its withdrawal from sportscar racing, citing lowering car sales and the economic downturn as reasons. A return, however, was not ruled out if funds can be procured for the future, but not likely before 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dagys|first=John|title=Peugeot 908 Bids Farewell|url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/le-mans-peugeot-908-bids-farewell/|website=SPEED.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206161142/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/le-mans-peugeot-908-bids-farewell/|archive-date=February 6, 2012|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 2019, [https://twitter.com/Peugeot/status/1194606779939934213 Peugeot announced] that they will take part in the 2022 [[FIA World Endurance Championship|WEC]] season, in the newly created \"Hypercar\" class.\n\n===Return to Pikes Peak Hillclimb Race===\n[[File:Peugeot 405 T-16 GR Pikes Peak - Flickr - andrewbasterfield.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ari Vatanen]]'s Pikes Peak Peugeot 405]]\nAfter [[Ari Vatanen]] and [[Bobby Unser]], in the late 1980s, won the Pikes Peak Hillclimb Race, Peugeot Sport and [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]] decided to unite their respective strengths and go for it.\n\nIn April 2013, a 208 T16 was tested by [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]] at [[Mont Ventoux]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/107020|author=David Evans|title=Peugeot reveals full spec of Loeb's 875bhp, 875kg Pikes Peak T16|work=Autosport|date=April 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505100506/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/107020|archive-date=May 5, 2013|accessdate=July 3, 2013|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> Loosely based on the shape and design of the production 208, the T16 is a lightweight {{convert|875|kg|lb|abbr=on}} vehicle that uses the rear wing from the [[Peugeot 908]], and has a 3.2-litre, twin-turbo V6 engine, developing {{convert|875|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} with the aim of competing at the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]].

description|Auto racing factory team by Peugeot}}\n[[File:Peugeotsportlogo.png|thumb|The Peugeot Sport logo.]]\n'''Peugeot Sport''' is the department of [[France|French]] carmaker [[Peugeot]] responsible for [[motorsport]] activities.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings in rallying===\n{{Main|Peugeot Sport WRC results}}\n[[File:Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 - Race Retro 2008 01.jpg|thumb|[[Peugeot 205 Turbo 16|Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 Evo 2]].]]\nPeugeot Sport was formed in 1981 under the name of '''Peugeot Talbot Sport''', after [[Jean Todt]], a [[World Rally Championship]] co-driver for [[Talbot]] driver [[Guy Fr\u00e9quelin]], was asked by Peugeot to create a sporting department for the [[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn]] group. The [[Rallying|rally]] team, established at [[Bois de Boulogne]] near [[Paris]],<ref>http://www.juwra.com/peugeot_season_1984.html</ref> debuted its [[Group B]] [[Peugeot 205 Turbo 16]] in the [[1984 World Rally Championship|1984 season]], and took its first victory in [[Rally Finland]] in the hands of [[Ari Vatanen]]. In the [[1985 World Rally Championship|1985 season]], Peugeot drivers Vatanen and [[Timo Salonen]] won seven out of the 12 rounds to give Peugeot its first manufacturers' title and Salonen the drivers' title. Vatanen had been seriously injured in an accident in Argentina in 1985, so was replaced by [[Juha Kankkunen]] for the [[1986 World Rally Championship|1986 season]], who promptly delivered the team the second consecutive title. The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] banned Group B cars for the the [[1987 World Rally Championship|1987 season]] after the fatal accident of [[Henri Toivonen]]. This lead Peugeot to switch to [[rally raid]], using the 205 to win the [[Dakar Rally]] for two consecutive years in 1987 to 1988, and then used the [[Peugeot 405|405]] to win in 1989 and 1990. Peugeot Talbot Sport also participated three times at the Pikes Peak Hillclimb Race in 1987, 1988 and 1989, winning the last two years, as well as in 2013 with the 208 T16.\n\n===Move to sportscars===\nIn [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]] Peugeot Talbot Sport established their [[Sports car racing|sportscar]] team at [[V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay]], France <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-warwick-on-top-of-world-1580501.html|title=Motor Racing: Warwick on top of world|publisher=The Independent|date=August 31, 1992|accessdate=March 26, 2010|location=London}}</ref> and in 1988 launched the [[Peugeot 905]] project, to develop a sportscar to begin competing in the [[World Sportscar Championship]] in the [[1991 World Sportscar Championship|1991 season]]. The 905 made its racing debut in the final few races of the [[1990 World Sportscar Championship|1990 season]], and finished second in the 1991 season. In the [[1992 World Sportscar Championship|1992 season]], Peugeot Talbot Sport won the [[1992 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]], with drivers [[Derek Warwick]], [[Yannick Dalmas]] and [[Mark Blundell]]. They also won the 1992 World Sportscar Championship, thanks to Warwick, Dalmas, [[Philippe Alliot]] and [[Mauro Baldi]]. The championship did not run in 1993, but Peugeot were able to take a 1\u20132\u20133 finish at the [[1993 24 Hours of Le Mans]], with [[\u00c9ric H\u00e9lary]], [[Christophe Bouchut]] and [[Geoff Brabham]] driving the winning car. Peugeot Talbot Sport subsequently pulled out of sportscar racing. Jean Todt, meanwhile, left Peugeot for [[Scuderia Ferrari]].\n\n===Formula One===\nPeugeot switched to [[Formula One]] for {{f1|1994}}, using a similar [[Formula One French engine manufacturers|3.5L V10 engine]] as found in the 905. This was easily developed to be used by [[McLaren]] in 1994. However, poor reliability led to the relationship ending at the end of 1994 after 8 podiums, zero victories and 17 DNF's. This led to Peugeot supplying [[Jordan Grand Prix]] in {{f1|1995}}, {{f1|1996}}, and {{f1|1997}} with 5 podiums as best results, before supplying the new [[Prost Grand Prix]] team for the {{f1|1998}}, {{f1|1999}} and {{f1|2000}} seasons.  After a pointless 2000 season where poor reliability matched with Prost inability to deliver a competitive chassis, plus having scored no wins since their debut, led to the French marque pulling the plug out of F1.\n\nThe Peugeot engines were bought by an Asian consortium led by former F1 designer [[Enrique Scalabroni]] called [[Asiatech]] and used for two further years (in 2001 for [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] team and in 2002 for [[Minardi]] team). The Asiatech engines were both reliable, powerful and were supplied at zero cost, but its poor driveability led to both teams replacing them in favor of more costly but more capable Cosworth units.\n\n===Touring car racing===\n[[File:Luciano Burti (5797860059).jpg|In 2009 and 2011, Peugeot won the Stock Car V8 championship with Cac\u00e1 Bueno (here Luciano Burti)|thumb]]\n\nPeugeot entered the [[British Touring Car Championship]] in 1992, preparing [[Peugeot 405|405]]'s for former champion [[Robb Gravett]]. The team was run in-house from the company's UK factory in [[Coventry]]. The 405 never won a race despite promising results in its four seasons of competition, before being replaced in 1996 by the [[Peugeot 406|406]]. Unfortunately Peugeot UK did not share any technical data with its European contemporaries, and the BTCC programme suffered. Peugeot handed the works deal to Motor Sport Developments for 1997 and 98, but wins still eluded the team. With spiralling costs in the series, Peugeot withdrew from the BTCC at the end of 1998.\n\nWith his [[Peugeot 406]], [[Laurent A\u00efello]] won the 1997 [[Super Tourenwagen Cup]] season.\n\nThe Peugeot 306 GTi won the prestigious [[Spa 24 hours]] endurance race in 1999 and 2000.\n\nPeugeot won five times the [[Danish Touringcar Championship]], with both the Peugeot 306 -winner in 1999, 2000 and 2001\u2013 and the [[Peugeot 307]] winner in 2002 and 2003.\n\nPeugeot has been racing successfully in the [[Asian Touring Car Series]], winning the 2000, 2001, and 2002 championships with the [[Peugeot 306|Peugeot 306 GTi]].\n\nIn 2001, Peugeot entered three [[BTC-T Peugeot 406 Coup\u00e9|406 Coup\u00e9s]] into the British Touring Car Championship to compete with the dominant [[Vauxhall Astra]] Coup\u00e9s. However, the 406 Coup\u00e9 was not competitive, despite some promise towards the end of the year, notably when Peugeot's Steve Soper led a race only to suffer engine failure in the last few laps. The 406 Coup\u00e9s were retired at the end of the following year and replaced with the [[BTC-T Peugeot 307|307]]\u2014again, uncompetitively\u2014in 2003.\n\nPeugeot has been racing successfully in the [[Stock Car Brasil]] series since 2007 and won the 2008, 2009, and 2011 championships.\n\nIn 2013, the [[Peugeot 208]]GTi won a one-two-three at the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]] endurance race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peugeot.com/en/news/victory-and-hat-trick-of-the-208-gti-peugeot-sport-at-the-nurburgring-24-hour-race|title=Victory and hat-trick of the 208 GTi Peugeot Sport at the N\u00fcrburgring 24 hour race|accessdate=2013-05-23|publisher=Peugeot Sport}}</ref>\n\n===Return to rallying===\n{{Main|Peugeot Sport WRC results}}\n[[File:Mg2 peugeot.jpg|thumb|[[Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm]] driving the [[Peugeot 206 WRC]] to victory at the 2001 [[Rally Finland]].]]\nIn 1999, Peugeot Sport returned to the World Rally Championship with the [[Peugeot 206 WRC]], under the guidance of director [[Corrado Provera]]. The car debuted at the [[Tour de Corse]], with [[Fran\u00e7ois Delecour]] driving one car and [[Gilles Panizzi]] and [[Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm]] sharing the second car over the remaining events. Gr\u00f6nholm finished fourth on the car's third event, [[Rally Finland]], before Panizzi finished second on [[Rallye Sanremo]].\n\nIn 2000, Gr\u00f6nholm gave the car its first victory at [[Rally Sweden]], and followed this up with wins in New Zealand, Finland and Australia on his way to the Drivers\u2019 championship. Panizzi won in Corsica and Sanremo, giving Peugeot the Manufacturers\u2019 championship.\n\nIn 2001, [[Didier Auriol]] joined the team, replacing Delecour as the main driver alongside Gr\u00f6nholm.  Panizzi and [[Harri Rovanper\u00e4]] also drove additional cars for the team on selected events. Rovanper\u00e4 won round two in Sweden, as Gr\u00f6nholm struggled with retirements during the first half of the year. Auriol won in Spain, Gr\u00f6nholm won in Finland, Australia and Great Britain, and Panizzi won in Italy. The team retained their manufacturers\u2019 crown, even though Gr\u00f6nholm was the best placed driver in the drivers\u2019 standings, in fourth place. Rovanper\u00e4 was fifth, Auriol eighth and Panizzi ninth.\n\nFor 2002, the team signed [[Richard Burns]], the 2001 champion, from Subaru, replacing Auriol in the team. Gr\u00f6nholm won round two in Sweden, before Panizzi took back-to-back wins in France and Spain. Gr\u00f6nholm won the next event in Cyprus, before he and Burns were disqualified for a technical infringement in Argentina. Gr\u00f6nholm won again in Finland, while Panizzi won his third event of the year in Italy. Gr\u00f6nholm completed back-to-back victories in New Zealand and Australia to take his second drivers\u2019 title. Burns finished the season fifth, ahead of Panizzi and Rovanper\u00e4 in sixth and seventh. Peugeot were able to take a third consecutive Manufacturers\u2019 title.\n\nThe driver lineup remained the same for 2003, with [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] joining as title sponsor. Gr\u00f6nholm won in Sweden yet again, and took another two wins in New Zealand and Argentina. Panizzi picked up another win in Spain. Poised to rejoin Subaru in 2004, Burns was ruled out of action ahead of the final round of the season in Great Britain, having suffered a blackout while driving to the event. He was replaced for the event and the 2004 season by Belgian [[Freddy Loix]]. Burns finished the season fourth in the standings, ahead of Gr\u00f6nholm in sixth. Peugeot lost its manufacturers crown to [[Citro\u00ebn]].\n\n[[File:Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm - 2004 Monte Carlo Rally.jpg|thumb|[[Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm]] driving the [[Peugeot 307 WRC]] on the 2004 [[Rally Monte Carlo]].]]\nPeugeot introduced a new car for the 2004 season, the [[Peugeot 307 WRC|307 WRC]], which was based upon the coup\u00e9 cabriolets version of the 307 road car. Having originally not been part of the team at the start of the season, Rovanper\u00e4 replaced Loix after two rounds in the team's second car alongside Gr\u00f6nholm, who struggled with the new car initially. He took the team's only victory of the season in Finland, and he finished fifth in the standings at the end of the season. Peugeot finished fourth in the manufacturers\u2019 standings.\n\nFor 2005, Peugeot signed [[Markko M\u00e4rtin]] from Ford to partner Gr\u00f6nholm. Once again, it took until Gr\u00f6nholm won Rally Finland yet again in August for the team to win. Two rallies later, in Great Britain, M\u00e4rtin's co-driver [[Michael Park (co-driver)|Michael Park]] was killed after the pair's 307 WRC left the road. M\u00e4rtin subsequently pulled out of the World Rally Championship. [[Daniel Carlsson (rally driver)|Daniel Carlsson]] and [[Nicolas Bernardi]] both filled in for him during the final four events. Gr\u00f6nholm took a second win of the season in Japan, on his way to third in the standings. Peugeot finished second in the manufacturers\u2019 standings. At the end of 2005, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn withdrew its two teams from the WRC. Citro\u00ebn took a year out to develop a new car and returned in 2007, but Peugeot did not return to the WRC.\n\nPeugeot Sport created the [[Peugeot 207 S2000]], a rally car built to [[Super 2000]] regulations. Peugeot Sport enter the cars, run by [[Kronos Racing]], in the [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]] (IRC). Peugeot drivers [[Enrique Garc\u00eda-Ojeda]], [[Nicolas Vouilloz]] and [[Kris Meeke]] won the IRC drivers' title in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively. It was replaced by [[Peugeot 208|208 T16]], which competes under R5 Regulations.\n\n===Return to sportscars===\n[[File:Peugeot905 evo1ter 1993.jpg|thumb|[[Peugeot 905]] won 2 times the [[24 Heures du Mans]] in 1992 and 1993, and the World Sports Car Championship]]\n[[File:Peugeot 908 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]], 2 times winner of the Intercontinental Le Mans Series]]\nUnder the guidance of new director [[Michel Barge]], Peugeot Sport returned to sportscar racing for 2007, taking on the dominant [[Audi]] with the [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]]. The car made its debut at the [[2007 1000km of Monza]], the opening round of the [[2007 Le Mans Series season]]. The pairing of [[Marc Gen\u00e9]] and [[Nicolas Minassian]] took the car to victory. At the [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans]], [[St\u00e9phane Sarrazin]] took pole position for the team ahead of the Audis. In the race, the #8 car of Sarrazin, [[Pedro Lamy]] and [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]] finished second behind the #1 Audi. After Le Mans, Sarrazin and Lamy took the Le Mans Series title for Peugeot.\n\nAt the [[2008 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Peugeot and Sarrazin once again took pole position, locking out the first three places on the grid. In the race, the trio of cars finished in second, third and fifth. In the Le Mans Series, Peugeot lost out to Audi again, Minassian and Gen\u00e9 finishing in second place.\n\nAt the beginning of 2009, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn made Citro\u00ebn Sport director [[Olivier Quesnel]] the director of Peugeot Sport too. At the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Sarrazin set his third consecutive pole position for the team. In the race, the team delivered its first Le Mans victory since 1993, with the trio of [[David Brabham]], Gen\u00e9 and [[Alexander Wurz]] winning ahead of the car driven by [[Franck Montagny]], Bourdais and Sarrazin. The team's third car finished the race in sixth position. The team only contested one round of the Le Mans Series season, at Spa as preparation for Le Mans itself.\n\nPeugeot scored a 1\u20132 finish at the [[2010 12 Hours of Sebring]]. However, reliability problems for the 908 at the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]] meant that Audi finished 1\u20132\u20133 at the race.\n\nAt the [[2011 12 Hours of Sebring]], the older Peugeot 908 HDi FAP owned by Oreca Racing had a surprise win over the factory 908s and Audi R15++s. At the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Peugeot saw itself in a position to win after two of the Audi R18s crashed; only a strong effort from Audi kept Peugeot from winning the race. The winning Audi was only 13 seconds ahead of the 2nd-place Peugeot 908.\n\nOn January 18, 2012, Peugeot Sport announced its withdrawal from sportscar racing, citing lowering car sales and the economic downturn as reasons. A return, however, was not ruled out if funds can be procured for the future, but not likely before 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dagys|first=John|title=Peugeot 908 Bids Farewell|url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/le-mans-peugeot-908-bids-farewell/|website=SPEED.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206161142/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/le-mans-peugeot-908-bids-farewell/|archive-date=February 6, 2012|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 2019, [https://twitter.com/Peugeot/status/1194606779939934213 Peugeot announced] that they will take part in the 2022 [[FIA World Endurance Championship|WEC]] season, in the newly created \"Hypercar\" class.\n\n===Return to Pikes Peak Hillclimb Race===\n[[File:Peugeot 405 T-16 GR Pikes Peak - Flickr - andrewbasterfield.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ari Vatanen]]'s Pikes Peak Peugeot 405]]\nAfter [[Ari Vatanen]] and [[Bobby Unser]], in the late 1980s, won the Pikes Peak Hillclimb Race, Peugeot Sport and [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]] decided to unite their respective strengths and go for it.\n\nIn April 2013, a 208 T16 was tested by [[S\u00e9bastien Loeb]] at [[Mont Ventoux]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/107020|author=David Evans|title=Peugeot reveals full spec of Loeb's 875bhp, 875kg Pikes Peak T16|work=Autosport|date=April 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505100506/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/107020|archive-date=May 5, 2013|accessdate=July 3, 2013|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> Loosely based on the shape and design of the production 208, the T16 is a lightweight {{convert|875|kg|lb|abbr=on}} vehicle that uses the rear wing from the [[Peugeot 908]], and has a 3.2-litre, twin-turbo V6 engine, developing {{convert|875|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} with the aim of competing at the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]].
