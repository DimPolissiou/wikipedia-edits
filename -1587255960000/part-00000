At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms of the top floor of the original Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of Frank Peder, George Taylor Hyde and Norman M.

At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms of the top floor of the original Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of Frank Peder, George Taylor Hyde and Norman M.

By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]]. Nobbs believed students should be exposed to architecture in practice, and designed the McGill Union (today the [[McCord Museum]]) across from McGill's [[Roddick Gates]].

This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students. By 1947, the School had become so cramped that a repurposed building on University Street was vacated to make room for the School's students.

It is a branch of the '''Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County (PLSJ)''', which services a large area in southeast Ohio \u2013 otherwise known as the [[Ohio Valley]].  Besides the Schiappa Library, PLSJ has branches all over [[Jefferson County, Ohio]] located in [[Toronto, Ohio|Toronto]], [[Brilliant, Ohio|Brilliant]], [[Tiltonsville, Ohio|Tiltonsville]], [[Dillonvale, Jefferson County, Ohio|Dillonvale]] and [[Adena, Ohio|Adena]] with the Main Library located in Steubenville.  The Schiappa branch is located at the west end of Steubenville on the [[Fort Steuben Mall]] property.  It not only serves as an additional library for the city of Steubenville, but also as a library for the neighboring village of [[Wintersville, Ohio]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Schiappa Branch Library opened its doors on February 2, 1987 in the west end of Steubenville, Ohio at 4141 Mall Drive, where it still sits on property donated by the Siciliano family.  This plot of land was one of many looked at in the time leading up to a final decision, but it was this area's location being adjacent to a large [[shopping center]] attracting people from all over the Ohio Valley that made it so desirable.  Huberta Siciliano made it clear that if she donated the land to the library, she would like the facility to be named after her parents: Albert and Mary A. Schiappa.<ref name=\"Lash, John 2005\">Lash, John.  ''The history of the Schiappa Branch Library in Steubenville, Ohio''.  May 2005.</ref>\n\nOne concern with the property that the Schiappa Library now sits upon was that the land was a former [[strip-mining]] area.  This caused many to note that the [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]] would be in danger of cracking and heaving once the [[pyrites]] swelled with moisture.  To resolve this, the library was built upon 110 [[concrete]] [[pylon (disambiguation)|pylons]], drilled to solid rock, which is between 4 and 14 feet deep at the site.<ref name=\"steubenvillelibrary.org\">Hall, Alan.  [http://www.steubenvillelibrary.org/Director/DCdetail.asp?dcID=108 \"Schiappa Library's 20th Anniversary\"], ''Herald-Star'', February 4, 2007, retrieved October 19th, 2008.</ref>\n\nWhen the library first opened, most shelves had very few books on them and it often seemed like everything was checked out.  To remedy this, returned books were shelved quickly and the State Regional Library sent over boxes of books to make the shelves more full temporarily.<ref name=\"steubenvillelibrary.org\"/>   Over the years, the collection of books has grown exponentially to include [[VHS|videotapes]], [[DVDs]], [[CDs]], [[audiobook]]s, [[periodicals]], and [[graphic novels]].\n\n==Renovations==\n\nBy 1990, the collection at Schiappa Branch Library had grown so large that talk of expanding the building had begun.  A larger children's area was needed, more [[Reference#Libraries|reference]] shelving would be required, and the collection in Schiappa's Ohio History and [[Genealogy]] room was beginning to take up more space than the shelves could fit.  There was also talk of adding a conference room, a children's activity room, and offices for the branch manager.  The project went forward in 1992 and the library was renovated with all of the above changes while the building itself stayed open to the public.  An extra wing was added for the children's area and activity room, a conference room and three study rooms were built, offices for the branch manager and extra workspaces were added behind the [[library circulation|Circulation]] desk, and the Reference and Genealogy departments were given their own closed in space for quiet studying and for keeping reference materials from leaving the room.<ref name=\"Lash, John 2005\"/>\n\nBeginning in 2007, plans were drawn up for another renovation project.  This time, it was the front [[lobby (room)|lobby]] and adult fiction/nonfiction areas that would be getting a makeover.  New flooring was put into the front lobby and periodical section.  New furniture was brought in, including new desks, workspaces, chairs and a counter for the Circulation department.  [[Vending machines]] were added beside new study areas for a more modern and customer friendly look.<ref>Hall, Alan.  [http://www.steubenvillelibrary.org/Director/DCdetail.asp?dcID=138 \"Library Cafe\"], ''Herald-Star'', February 24, 2008, retrieved October 20, 2008.</ref>  The project was essentially complete in spring of 2008.\n\n==Departments==\n\n===General circulation===\n\nThe [[Library circulation|circulation]] department is located in the front lobby of the library.  Items may be returned or taken out at the circulation desk.  Borrowers may also pick up items that have been placed on hold (brought in from other libraries).  The [[librarian|library assistants]] at Circulation will help patrons locate items throughout the building or assist in ordering items that are not currently stocked.  A borrower may also take care of any pending [[Fine (penalty)|overdue fines]] in this department.\n\n===Children/teens===\n\nLocated in the rear of the Schiappa Library, this area includes a listening center for audio books, toys for young ones, couches for parents, a youthful reading area for teens<ref>[http://steubenvillelibrary.org/Services/YoungAdults/index.asp PLSJ Website: YoungAdults]</ref> and several desks for studying and activities.  There is also an activity room used for hosting children's programming and large group activities.\n\n===Reference===\n\nThe Reference department is mostly for quiet study and Internet usage.  The room is equipped with eight [[computers]] wired to the Internet.  The computers use timed software to allow each borrower up to an hour and twenty minutes of Internet time each day.  The Reference staff will assist in [[technical support]], [[troubleshooting]], and will answer questions both in person and online through the [[Meebo]] chat service.  The Reference librarian will also assist in ordering material not currently in the libraries [[database]].\n\n===Ohio Room/genealogy===\n\nThe Ohio History/Genealogy department is unique to the Schiappa Branch Library.  Nowhere else in the Jefferson County library system will one find this information.  The room is filled with books not only helping with basic genealogy techniques, but also books specific to the Steubenville and Jefferson County region that the library serves.  The collection consists of birth, death and marriage [[record (computer science)|records]], newspaper clippings, [[photo albums]], [[high school]] [[yearbooks]], and United States [[census]] materials, among other things.  There is also a large collection the Steubenville area's local newspaper, [http://www.hsconnect.com The ''Herald-Star''], dating back to the early 19th century on [[microfilm]].  The [[genealogist]] on duty can assist in using these materials as well as the wide variety of [[online]] materials.<ref>[http://steubenvillelibrary.org/Services/History/index.asp PLSJ Website]</ref>\n\n==Services and programs==\n\nThe Schiappa Branch offers many free services, such as [[notary public|public notaries]] on duty during working hours, Internet access, [[Wi-Fi]] availability, and beginner computer instruction.  The library also houses public [[photocopier|copy machines]] and [[computer printer|printers]] for a fee.\n\nThe library offers many programs for people of all ages.  Children can visit the Tot Time, Babygarten, and Story Hour programs.<ref>[http://kids.steubenvillelibrary.com/Events/index.asp PLSJ Kids Webpage].</ref>  Teen programs include bi-monthly [[videogame]] nights<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/plsjgames Schiappa Game Nights MySpace Page]</ref> and an all-ages movie is shown once a month.<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/plsjmovies Schiappa Movie Nights MySpace Page].</ref>  Adult programs vary from month to month,<ref>[http://steubenvillelibrary.org/Events/index.asp PLSJ Events Webpage].</ref> but have \u2013 in the past \u2013 included wine tasting, cooking demonstrations, and author visits.
