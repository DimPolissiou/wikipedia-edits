He was one of [[Walt Disney]]'s main team of animators, known collectively as [[Disney's Nine Old Men]]. His films have been honored with two [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film]].\n\nOutside of his job as an animator, Kimball was a railroad enthusiast as well as a talented [[jazz]] trombonist. He founded and led the seven-piece [[Dixieland]] band [[Firehouse Five Plus Two]], in which he played [[trombone]].\n\n== Early life ==\nKimball was born on March 4, 1914, in Minneapolis. His father was a salesman who traveled widely. He grew up in the Midwest, often residing with his grandparents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1400972/Ward-Kimball.html|title=Ward Kimball|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nWhile Kimball was a brilliant [[Drafter|draftsman]], he preferred to work on comical characters rather than realistic human designs. Animating came easily to him and he was constantly looking to do things differently. Because of this, [[Walt Disney]] called Ward a genius in the book ''The Story of Walt Disney''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/wardkimball/definitive-biography-animation-icon-ward-kimball-published-2018-152305.html|title=Definitive Biography Of Animation Icon Ward Kimball To Be Published In 2018|date=2017-07-14|work=Cartoon Brew|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en-US}}</ref> While there were many talented animators at Disney, Ward's efforts stand out as unique.\n\nAccording to Jeff Lenburg's assessment of him, Kimball was a pioneer [[animator]] and a great innovator of his time. He instilled life to diverse Disney characters, such as [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Jiminy Cricket]], the [[Cheshire Cat]], the [[Mad Hatter]], and [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\">Lenburg (2006), pp. 177\u201379</ref>\n\nKimball attended the [[Santa Barbara School of the Arts]] in order to become a [[Painting|painter]] and [[illustrator]]. Kimball's instructor at the school suggested to him that his work should be submitted to Walt Disney Productions (later known as the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]), and that he should pursue a career in [[animation]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> In March 1934, a 20-year-old Kimball applied for a job at the Disney studio. In April 1934, he was hired as an [[Inbetweening|inbetweener]]. He was then promoted to an assistant animator. He served as an assistant to animator [[Hamilton Luske]]. Kimball worked primarily in the ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' series, where his film credits include the animated short films ''[[The Wise Little Hen]]'' (1934), ''[[The Goddess of Spring]]''  (1934), and ''[[The Tortoise and the Hare (film)|The Tortoise and the Hare]]'' (1935). He also worked on ''Mickey Mouse'' shorts, where his film credits include the short film ''[[Orphan's Benefit]]'' (1934).<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nIn 1936, Kimball was promoted to an animator in his own right. He continued to work in the ''Silly Symphony'' series. Some of his memorable credits in this position include the animated short films ''[[Toby Tortoise Returns]]'' (1936), ''[[More Kittens]]'' (1936), and ''[[Mother Goose Goes Hollywood]]'' (1938). His first solo effort as an animator was animating a grasshopper turned musician in ''[[Woodland Caf\u00e9]]'' (1937).<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nAs one of [[Disney's Nine Old Men]], Kimball was tasked with animating on ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937). The film was the first feature-length animated film by the Disney studio.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> Kimball spent months working on the scene where the [[Seven Dwarfs]] are eating soup, prepared for them by [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> This scene, however, was ultimately cut to shorten the length of the film.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Snow White'', Kimball was promoted to a supervising or directing animator. He would remain in this position until his retirement in the 1970s. His employer [[Walt Disney]] was sufficiently satisfied with Kimball's work that he entrusted him with designing the new character [[Jiminy Cricket]] in the Disney Studio's next feature film, ''[[Pinocchio (1940 movie)|Pinocchio]]''. It took Kimball 12 or 14 drafts before completing his final design of Jiminy.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> Kimball told one interviewer that he \"hated\" animating Jiminy Cricket: \"I got sick of drawing that oval head looking in every direction.\"<ref>\"[http://cartoonician.com/ward-kimballs-final-farewell/ Ward Kimball's Final Farewell\", ''Hogan's Alley'' #11.]</ref>) Kimball's next major task was designing the sympathetic Crows in ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941). Following the example of the Seven Dwarfs from ''Snow White'', Kimball had to give each crow a distinct appearance and character.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nKimball supervised or directed the animation of several Disney animated feature films. Among them were ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), ''[[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]]'' (1941), and ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' (1944). The last film mentioned featured the trio of [[Donald Duck]], [[Jos\u00e9 Carioca]], and [[Panchito Pistoles]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> According to animation historian Jeff Lenburg, ''The Three Caballeros'' is considered to have a place among the finest work of Kimball's career.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/09/local/me-kimball9|title=Ward Kimball, 88; Key Disney Animator|last=SOLOMON|first=CHARLES|date=2002-07-09|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> The film was reportedly successful in the American [[box office]], earning about 3 to 4 million dollars.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nKimball directed the character animation and sequences of the [[Pecos Bill]] segment in ''[[Melody Time]]'' (1948).<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> He also worked as a senior animator for ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'' (1949). In ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), Kimball was responsible for the characters [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Jaq and Gus|Jaq and Gus]] and [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Lucifer|Lucifer the Cat]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> In ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951), Kimball was responsible for [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]], [[the Walrus and the Carpenter]], [[the Hatter]] and his mad [[tea party]], and the [[Cheshire Cat]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> His other film credits include the feature films ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), and ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971).<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nKimball spent much of his career animating theatrical animated short films. However, he also served as a director for some of them. He and [[Charles August Nichols]] co-directed the animated short films ''[[Melody (1953 film)|Melody]]'' (1953) and ''[[Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom]]'' (1953).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://nightflight.com/escalation-this-1968-anti-war-animated-film-by-disney-legend-ward-kimball-is-as-timely-as-ever/|title=\u201cEscalation\u201d: This 1968 anti-war animated film by Disney legend Ward Kimball is as timely as ever|website=nightflight.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-17}}</ref> ''Melody'' was the Disney studio's first animated [[3D film]];<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> ''Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom''  won the 1954 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] and was the Disney studio's first [[widescreen]] [[CinemaScope]] animated film.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> Kimball also directed the short films ''[[It's Tough to Be a Bird]]'' (1969) and ''Dad, Can I Borrow the Car?'' (1970). ''It's Tough to Be a Bird'' won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064504/| title=It's Tough to be a Bird| year=2008|accessdate=6 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nKimball served as a screenwriter for the [[featurette]] ''Eyes In Outer Space'' (1959). The film combined live action and animation. It depicted [[weather satellite]]s and explained how the weather is predicted. The film was originally theatrically released. Around 1962, it started being shown in [[Disneyland]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Disney studio shifted its focus from theatrical animation to television. Kimball wrote and directed three hour-long television shows about [[space exploration]]. They were ''[[Man in Space]]'' (1955), ''[[Man and the Moon]]'' (1955), and ''[[Mars and Beyond]]'' (1957). The consultants for these shows included pioneers of the [[Space Age]], such as [[aerospace engineering|aerospace engineer]] [[Wernher von Braun]]. According to animation historian Jeff Lenburg, the three shows helped in sparking popular interest in [[spaceflight]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> Kimball was also responsible for the science-fiction two-reel cartoon ''[[Cosmic Capers]]'' (1957).<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nKimball also worked (as a writer) on the live-action film ''[[Babes in Toyland (1961 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (1961), a musical film.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> He later returned to television and directed 43 episodes of ''[[The Mouse Factory]]'' (1972\u20131973).<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nAccording to Jeff Lenburg, Kimball retired in 1973 and left the Disney studio. He continued, however, to serve as a consultant on special assignments. He worked on the [[World of Motion]] attraction for Disney's [[EPCOT Center]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\n==Other activities==\n\nKimball was profiled by producer [[Jerry Fairbanks]] in his [[Paramount Pictures]] film short series ''Unusual Occupations''. This [[35mm movie film|35mm]] [[Magnacolor]] film short was released theatrically in 1944; it focused on Kimball's backyard railroad and full-sized locomotive.\n\nKimball was also a [[jazz]] [[trombonist]]. He founded and led the seven-piece [[Dixieland]] band [[Firehouse Five Plus Two]], in which he played [[trombone]]. The band made at least 13 [[Gramophone record|LP records]] and toured clubs, college campuses and jazz festivals from the 1940s to early 1970s. Kimball once said that Walt Disney permitted the second career as long as it did not interfere with his animation work. Kimball appeared on the March 17, 1954, episode of ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', where [[Groucho Marx]] coaxed him into playing his trombone with the house band. He and his partner won $75 in their quiz portion of the show, including one Disney animation question that Kimball answered easily.\n\nKimball continued to work at Disney until 1974, working on the [[Disney anthology television series]], being one of the writers for ''[[Babes in Toyland (1961 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'', creating animation for ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', directing the animation for ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', and working on titles for feature films such as ''The Adventures Of Bullwhip Griffin'' and ''[[Million Dollar Duck]]''. His last staff work for Disney was producing and directing the Disney TV show ''[[The Mouse Factory]]'', which ran from 1972 to 1974. He continued to do various projects on his own, even returning to do some publicity tours for the Disney corporation. He also worked on the [[World of Motion]] attraction for Disney's [[EPCOT Center]].\n\nKimball also produced two editions of a volume titled ''Art Afterpieces,''<ref>''Art Afterpieces'', {{ISBN|978-0-8431-0366-3}}</ref> in which he revised various well-known works of art, such as putting ''[[Mona Lisa]]'''s hair up in curlers, showing ''[[Whistler's Mother]]'' watching TV, and adding a [[Communist]] flag and [[Russian culture|Russian]] boots to ''[[Pinkie (Lawrence painting)|Pinkie]]''. These masterpiece remixes are thought to have been appropriated by the street artist [[Banksy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://art-for-a-change.com/blog/2013/07/ward-kimball-art-afterpieces.html|title=Ward Kimball - Art Afterpieces|year=2013|accessdate=14 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nHis three acting appearances on film were an uncredited role as a [[List of jazz musicians|jazz musician]] (with his Firehouse Five Plus Two) in ''[[Hit Parade of 1951]],'' an [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Chief in [[Mike Jittlov]]'s ''[[The Wizard of Speed and Time]]'', and voicing and giving his likeness to half of the vaudeville duo \"Ward and Fred\" in the [[Mickey Mouse]] short ''[[The Nifty Nineties]]'' (with fellow Disney animator [[Fred Moore (animator)|Fred Moore]]). Kimball served as host of the \"[[Man in Space]]\" and \"[[Man and the Moon]]\" episodes of ''[[Disneyland (TV series)|Disneyland]]'' in 1955 and 1956 respectively. He hosted the second season of the 1992 [[PBS]] series ''[[Tracks Ahead]]''. That season has since been repackaged to feature current host [[Spencer Christian]].\n\nAs recounted in [[Neal Gabler]]'s biography of Walt Disney,<ref>Gabler, Neal: ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (Random House, 2007).</ref> Ward Kimball was a key figure in spreading the [[urban legend]] that Disney had left instructions for his body to be preserved by [[cryonics]] after his death.\n\nAmid Amidi wrote a biography of Kimball, ''Full Steam Ahead: The Life and Art of Ward Kimball'' that was projected for publication in the fall of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/books/pre-order-full-steam-ahead-the-ward-kimball-biography.html|title=Pre-Order \"Full Steam Ahead!,\" the Ward Kimball Biography|website=cartoonbrew.com|access-date=2012-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405164845/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/books/pre-order-full-steam-ahead-the-ward-kimball-biography.html#|archive-date=2012-04-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, publication of the biography was canceled in February 2013, which Amidi believed was due to pressure from the Disney corporation.<ref>[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/wardkimball/whats-up-ward-kimball-78557.html Amid Amidi]: \"Yes, Chronicle Books nixed the publication of my book...

He was also an avid [[collecting|collector]] of [[model trains]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.readingeagle.com/berks-country/article/treasure-hunt-walt-disney-called-ward-kimball-a-genius-but-he-was-just-a-normal-train-collector|title=Treasure Hunt: Walt Disney called Ward Kimball a 'genius,' but he was just a normal train collector {{!}} Reading Eagle - BERKSCOUNTRY|work=Reading Eagle|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en}}</ref>\n\nKimball was an avid railway enthusiast and donated his {{RailGauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] collection to the [[Southern California Railway Museum]] (formerly the Orange Empire Railway Museum) in [[Perris, California]]. A full-size [[steam locomotive]], which Kimball ran on his private {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} backyard railroad known as ''[[Grizzly Flats Railroad]]'' in [[San Gabriel, California]], bears some of his original artwork on the headlamp and cab, and is on permanent display at the museum.<ref name=Broggie>Broggie, Michael, ''Walt Disney's Railroad Story'', Virginia Beach, VA: The Donning Company Publishers, 2006 (2nd edition), pp. 52&ndash;59, 200.</ref><ref>''Steam Passenger Service Directory, 1967,'' p. 18, Empire State Railway Museum, Inc., New York, NY, 1967.</ref>  Kimball's roundhouse also included two small steam engines that had been used on sugar cane plantations, one of which was his and the other was owned by his friend, noted railroad historian [[Gerald M.

In a rare deviation from its usually tight copyright policy, the Disney corporation allowed the city to decorate the transit center with Kimball's artwork. The center is currently served by [[Riverside Transit Agency]] buses, with train service as part of the [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] Perris Valley Line.<ref>[http://www.cityofperris.org/news/2010_stories/01-05-10_depot.html New Perris Transit Center to Honor Ward Kimball - Phase 1 Grand Opening], Cityofperris.org</ref>\n\nKimball is credited with helping [[Walt Disney]] for the inspiration to install the [[Disneyland Railroad]] at [[Disneyland]]. The inspiration for the Disneyland Railroad also partly came from Disney's personal {{RailGauge|7.25in}} gauge, [[live steam]] backyard [[Carolwood Pacific Railroad]], which Kimball had partially constructed. Kimball's Grizzly Flats train station served as the model for the Disneyland Frontierland Train Station. As a tribute to Kimball, Engine No.&nbsp;5 of the Disneyland Railroad is named the ''Ward Kimball''.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=Broggie />\n\nIn addition, Kimball also designed the logo for the Wildcat Railroad in Los Gatos, CA, owned by [[William \"Billy\" Jones|Billy Jones]], a friend of Walt Disney who was an engineer for the Disneyland Railroad during its first week of operation.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Beautiful Billy Jones Wildcat Railroad at Vasona Park - 18\" Gauge Live Steam in Los Gatos - 60p|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UOavrsdEn8|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=CaptainHarlock999|accessdate=27 June 2017|date=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nKimball's talents are also evident in the reproduction steam locomotives built for the National Park Service at the [[Golden Spike National Historic Site]] at [[Promontory, Utah]]. Kimball helped match colors with an engine at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and painted the artwork for the replicas of the [[Union Pacific No. 119]] and [[Jupiter (locomotive)|Central Pacific Jupiter]] built by [[O'Connor Engineering Laboratories]] for the Park Service.<ref>Dowty, Robert R., ''Rebirth of the Jupiter and the 119: Building the Replica Locomotives at Golden Spike,'' Tucson, AZ: Southwest Parks & Monuments Association, 1994, p. 35.</ref>\n\n==''Escalation''==\n{{Main|Escalation (1968 animated film)}}\n\nIn 1968 Kimball directed a two-minute animated short called ''[[Escalation (animated short)|Escalation]]'', which criticized [[Lyndon B.

He was one of [[Walt Disney]]'s team of animators, known collectively as [[Disney's Nine Old Men]]. His films have been honored with two [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film]].\n\nOutside of his job as an animator, Kimball was a railroad enthusiast as well as a talented [[jazz]] trombonist. He founded and led the seven-piece [[Dixieland]] band [[Firehouse Five Plus Two]], in which he played [[trombone]].\n\n== Early life ==\nKimball was born on March 4, 1914, in Minneapolis. His father was a salesman who traveled widely. He grew up in the Midwest, often residing with his grandparents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1400972/Ward-Kimball.html|title=Ward Kimball|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nWhile Kimball was a brilliant [[Drafter|draftsman]], he preferred to work on comical characters rather than realistic human designs. Animating came easily to him and he was constantly looking to do things differently. Because of this, [[Walt Disney]] called Ward a genius in the book ''The Story of Walt Disney''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/wardkimball/definitive-biography-animation-icon-ward-kimball-published-2018-152305.html|title=Definitive Biography Of Animation Icon Ward Kimball To Be Published In 2018|date=2017-07-14|work=Cartoon Brew|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en-US}}</ref> While there were many talented animators at Disney, Ward's efforts stand out as unique.\n\nAccording to Jeff Lenburg's assessment of him, Kimball was a pioneer [[animator]] and a great innovator of his time. He served as one of [[Disney's Nine Old Men]]. He instilled life to diverse Disney characters, such as [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Jiminy Cricket]], the [[Cheshire Cat]], the [[Mad Hatter]], and [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\">Lenburg (2006), pp. 177\u201379</ref>\n\nKimball attended the [[Santa Barbara School of the Arts]] in order to become a [[Painting|painter]] and [[illustrator]]. Kimball's instructor at the school suggested to him that his work should be submitted to Walt Disney Productions (later known as the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]), and that he should pursue a career in [[animation]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> In March 1934, a 20-year-old Kimball applied for a job at the Disney studio. In April 1934, he was hired as an [[Inbetweening|inbetweener]]. He was then promoted to an assistant animator. He served as an assistant to animator [[Hamilton Luske]]. Kimball worked primarily in the ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' series, where his film credits include the animated short films ''[[The Wise Little Hen]]'' (1934), ''[[The Goddess of Spring]]''  (1934), and ''[[The Tortoise and the Hare (film)|The Tortoise and the Hare]]'' (1935). He also worked on the ''Mickey Mouse'' series, where his film credits include the short film ''[[Orphan's Benefit]]'' (1934).<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nIn 1936, Kimball was promoted to an animator in his own right. He continued to work in the ''Silly Symphony'' series. Some of his memorable credits in this position include the animated short films ''[[Toby Tortoise Returns]]'' (1936), ''[[More Kittens]]'' (1936), and ''[[Mother Goose Goes Hollywood]]'' (1938). His first solo effort as an animator was animating a grasshopper turned musician in ''[[Woodland Caf\u00e9]]'' (1937).<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nKimball was included in the team of animators known later as [[Disney's Nine Old Men]], whose original task was animating ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937). The film was the first feature-length animated film by the Disney studio.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> Kimball spent months working on the sequence animation for a scene where the [[Seven Dwarfs]] are eating soup, prepared for them by [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> This scene, however, was ultimately left out, since it would have come after the sequence in which the dwarfs washed their hands.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Snow White'', Kimball was promoted to a supervising or directing animator. He would remain in this position until his retirement in the 1970s. His employer [[Walt Disney]] was sufficiently satisfied with Kimball's work that he entrusted him with designing new character [[Jiminy Cricket]]. The character was intended for use in the Disney studio's next feature film, ''[[Pinocchio (1940 movie)|Pinocchio]]''. It took Kimball 12 or 14 drafts before completing his final design of Jiminy.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> Kimball told one interviewer that he \"hated\" animating Jiminy Cricket: \"I got sick of drawing that oval head looking in every direction.\"<ref>\"[http://cartoonician.com/ward-kimballs-final-farewell/ Ward Kimball's Final Farewell\", ''Hogan's Alley'' #11.]</ref>) Kimball's next major task was designing the sympathetic Crows in ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941). Following the example of the Seven Dwarfs from ''Snow White'', Kimball had to give each crow a distinct appearance and character.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nKimball supervised or directed the animation of several Disney animated feature films. Among them were ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), ''[[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]]'' (1941), and ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' (1944). The last film mentioned featured the trio of [[Donald Duck]], [[Jos\u00e9 Carioca]], and [[Panchito Pistoles]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> According to animation historian Jeff Lenburg, ''The Three Caballeros'' is considered to have a place among the finest work of Kimball's career.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/09/local/me-kimball9|title=Ward Kimball, 88; Key Disney Animator|last=SOLOMON|first=CHARLES|date=2002-07-09|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> The film was reportedly successful in the American [[box office]], earning about 3 to 4 million dollars.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nKimball directed the character animation and sequences of the [[Pecos Bill]] segment in ''[[Melody Time]]'' (1948).<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> He also worked as a senior animator for ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'' (1949). In ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), Kimball was responsible for the characters [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Jaq and Gus|Jaq and Gus]] and [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Lucifer|Lucifer the Cat]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> In ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951), Kimball was responsible for [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]], [[the Walrus and the Carpenter]], [[the Hatter]] and his mad [[tea party]], and the [[Cheshire Cat]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> His other film credits include the feature films ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), and ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971).<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nKimball spent much of his career animating theatrical animated short films. However, he also served as a director for some of them. He and [[Charles August Nichols]] co-directed the animated short films ''[[Melody (1953 film)|Melody]]'' (1953) and ''[[Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom]]'' (1953).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://nightflight.com/escalation-this-1968-anti-war-animated-film-by-disney-legend-ward-kimball-is-as-timely-as-ever/|title=\u201cEscalation\u201d: This 1968 anti-war animated film by Disney legend Ward Kimball is as timely as ever|website=nightflight.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-17}}</ref> ''Melody'' was the Disney studio's first animated [[3D film]];<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> ''Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom''  won the 1954 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] and was the Disney studio's first [[widescreen]] [[CinemaScope]] animated film.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> Kimball also directed the short films ''[[It's Tough to Be a Bird]]'' (1969) and ''Dad, Can I Borrow the Car?'' (1970).

The film combined live action and animation. It depicted [[weather satellite]]s and explained how the weather is predicted. The film was originally theatrically released. Around 1962, it started being shown in [[Disneyland]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Disney studio shifted its focus from theatrical animation to television. Kimball wrote and directed three hour-long television shows about [[space exploration]]. They were ''[[Man in Space]]'' (1955), ''[[Man and the Moon]]'' (1955), and ''[[Mars and Beyond]]'' (1957). The consultants for these shows included pioneers of the [[Space Age]], such as [[aerospace engineering|aerospace engineer]] [[Wernher von Braun]]. According to animation historian Jeff Lenburg, the three shows helped in sparking popular interest in [[spaceflight]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> Kimball was also responsible for the science-fiction two-reel cartoon ''[[Cosmic Capers]]'' (1957).<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nKimball also worked (as a writer) on the live-action film ''[[Babes in Toyland (1961 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (1961), a musical film.<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/> He later returned to television and directed 43 episodes of ''[[The Mouse Factory]]'' (1972\u20131973).<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\nAccording to Jeff Lenburg, Kimball retired in 1973 and left the Disney studio. He continued, however, to serve as a consultant on special assignments. He worked on the [[World of Motion]] attraction for Disney's [[EPCOT Center]].<ref name=\"Lenburg\"/>\n\n==Other activities==\n\nKimball was profiled by producer [[Jerry Fairbanks]] in his [[Paramount Pictures]] film short series ''Unusual Occupations''. This [[35mm movie film|35mm]] [[Magnacolor]] film short was released theatrically in 1944; it focused on Kimball's backyard railroad and full-sized locomotive.\n\nKimball was also a [[jazz]] [[trombonist]]. He founded and led the seven-piece [[Dixieland]] band [[Firehouse Five Plus Two]], in which he played [[trombone]]. The band made at least 13 [[Gramophone record|LP records]] and toured clubs, college campuses and jazz festivals from the 1940s to early 1970s. Kimball once said that Walt Disney permitted the second career as long as it did not interfere with his animation work. Kimball appeared on the March 17, 1954, episode of ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', where [[Groucho Marx]] coaxed him into playing his trombone with the house band. He and his partner won $75 in their quiz portion of the show, including one Disney animation question that Kimball answered easily.\n\nKimball continued to work at Disney until 1974, working on the [[Disney anthology television series]], being one of the writers for ''[[Babes in Toyland (1961 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'', creating animation for ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', directing the animation for ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', and working on titles for feature films such as ''The Adventures Of Bullwhip Griffin'' and ''[[Million Dollar Duck]]''. His last staff work for Disney was producing and directing the Disney TV show ''[[The Mouse Factory]]'', which ran from 1972 to 1974. He continued to do various projects on his own, even returning to do some publicity tours for the Disney corporation. He also worked on the [[World of Motion]] attraction for Disney's [[EPCOT Center]].\n\nKimball also produced two editions of a volume titled ''Art Afterpieces,''<ref>''Art Afterpieces'', {{ISBN|978-0-8431-0366-3}}</ref> in which he revised various well-known works of art, such as putting ''[[Mona Lisa]]'''s hair up in curlers, showing ''[[Whistler's Mother]]'' watching TV, and adding a [[Communist]] flag and [[Russian culture|Russian]] boots to ''[[Pinkie (Lawrence painting)|Pinkie]]''. These masterpiece remixes are thought to have been appropriated by the street artist [[Banksy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://art-for-a-change.com/blog/2013/07/ward-kimball-art-afterpieces.html|title=Ward Kimball - Art Afterpieces|year=2013|accessdate=14 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nHis three acting appearances on film were an uncredited role as a [[List of jazz musicians|jazz musician]] (with his Firehouse Five Plus Two) in ''[[Hit Parade of 1951]],'' an [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Chief in [[Mike Jittlov]]'s ''[[The Wizard of Speed and Time]]'', and voicing and giving his likeness to half of the vaudeville duo \"Ward and Fred\" in the [[Mickey Mouse]] short ''[[The Nifty Nineties]]'' (with fellow Disney animator [[Fred Moore (animator)|Fred Moore]]). Kimball served as host of the \"[[Man in Space]]\" and \"[[Man and the Moon]]\" episodes of ''[[Disneyland (TV series)|Disneyland]]'' in 1955 and 1956 respectively. He hosted the second season of the 1992 [[PBS]] series ''[[Tracks Ahead]]''. That season has since been repackaged to feature current host [[Spencer Christian]].\n\nAs recounted in [[Neal Gabler]]'s biography of Walt Disney,<ref>Gabler, Neal: ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination'' (Random House, 2007).</ref> Ward Kimball was a key figure in spreading the [[urban legend]] that Disney had left instructions for his body to be preserved by [[cryonics]] after his death.\n\nAmid Amidi wrote a biography of Kimball, ''Full Steam Ahead: The Life and Art of Ward Kimball'' that was projected for publication in the fall of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/books/pre-order-full-steam-ahead-the-ward-kimball-biography.html|title=Pre-Order \"Full Steam Ahead!,\" the Ward Kimball Biography|website=cartoonbrew.com|access-date=2012-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405164845/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/books/pre-order-full-steam-ahead-the-ward-kimball-biography.html#|archive-date=2012-04-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, publication of the biography was canceled in February 2013, which Amidi believed was due to pressure from the Disney corporation.<ref>[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/wardkimball/whats-up-ward-kimball-78557.html Amid Amidi]: \"Yes, Chronicle Books nixed the publication of my book...

A full-size [[steam locomotive]], which Kimball ran on his private {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} backyard railroad known as ''[[Grizzly Flats Railroad]]'' in [[San Gabriel, California]], bears some of his original artwork on the headlamp and cab, and is on permanent display at the museum.<ref name=Broggie>Broggie, Michael, ''Walt Disney's Railroad Story'', Virginia Beach, VA: The Donning Company Publishers, 2006 (2nd edition), pp. 52&ndash;59, 200.</ref><ref>''Steam Passenger Service Directory, 1967,'' p. 18, Empire State Railway Museum, Inc., New York, NY, 1967.</ref>  Kimball's roundhouse also included two small steam engines that had been used on sugar cane plantations, one of which was his and the other was owned by his friend, noted railroad historian [[Gerald M.

In a rare deviation from its usually tight copyright policy, the Disney corporation allowed the city to decorate the transit center with Kimball's artwork. The center is currently served by [[Riverside Transit Agency]] buses, with train service as part of the [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] Perris Valley Line.<ref>[http://www.cityofperris.org/news/2010_stories/01-05-10_depot.html New Perris Transit Center to Honor Ward Kimball - Phase 1 Grand Opening], Cityofperris.org</ref>\n\nKimball is credited with helping [[Walt Disney]] for the inspiration to install the [[Disneyland Railroad]] at [[Disneyland]]. The inspiration for the Disneyland Railroad also partly came from Disney's personal {{RailGauge|7.25in}} gauge, [[live steam]] backyard [[Carolwood Pacific Railroad]], which Kimball had partially constructed. Kimball's Grizzly Flats train station served as the model for the Disneyland Frontierland Train Station. As a tribute to Kimball, Engine No.&nbsp;5 of the Disneyland Railroad is named the ''Ward Kimball''.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=Broggie />\n\nIn addition, Kimball also designed the logo for the Wildcat Railroad in Los Gatos, CA, owned by [[William \"Billy\" Jones|Billy Jones]], a friend of Walt Disney who was an engineer for the Disneyland Railroad during its first week of operation.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Beautiful Billy Jones Wildcat Railroad at Vasona Park - 18\" Gauge Live Steam in Los Gatos - 60p|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UOavrsdEn8|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=CaptainHarlock999|accessdate=27 June 2017|date=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nKimball's talents are also evident in the reproduction steam locomotives built for the National Park Service at the [[Golden Spike National Historic Site]] at [[Promontory, Utah]].
