As portrayed by Carol Burnett, Eunice was in five episodes of ''Mama's Family'', all of which were in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1, 2)|first life of ''Mama's Family'']] on [[NBC]]. Four of Burnett's five appearances were in season 1. The fifth episode of season 2 (\"Rashomama\"), which aired on November 3, 1983, was Burnett's final portrayal of Eunice. The character made two subsequent appearances in flashback episodes. Tanya Fenmore played Eunice as a child in the nineteenth episode of season 2 (\"Mama's Birthday).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640588/</ref> This marked the character's final appearance in the first life of the sitcom.\n\nEunice appeared only once during the [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life of ''Mama's Family'']] (originally in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]]).

She declined to explain her reasons to Bubba, hanging up when Mama threatened to put him on the phone.\n\nAlways clad in a tattered green dress and wearing her hair in a 1940s-era perm, Eunice is a working-class homemaker married to Ed Higgins. Eunice had a stormy, irrepressible, browbeating persona, always going melodramatically out of control, ranting and raving. However, especially on ''The Family'' sketches, Eunice was beaten down by her tyrannical, emotionally-abusive mother, and her fits of rage were usually provoked by her mother's passive-aggressive comments.

Big up-front specifications would probably cause a lot of waste in such cases, i.e., are not economically sound.

When the needs of a project change, an adaptive team changes as well. An adaptive team has difficulty describing exactly what will happen in the future. The further away a date is, the more vague an adaptive method is about what will happen on that date. An adaptive team cannot report exactly what tasks they will do next week, but only which features they plan for next month. When asked about a release six months from now, an adaptive team might be able to report only the mission statement for the release, or a statement of expected value vs. cost.\n\n''Predictive'' methods, in contrast, focus on analysing and planning the future in detail and cater for known risks. In the extremes, a predictive team can report exactly what features and tasks are planned for the entire length of the development process. Predictive methods rely on effective early phase analysis and if this goes very wrong, the project may have difficulty changing direction. Predictive teams often institute a [[change control board]] to ensure they consider only the most valuable changes.\n\n[[Risk analysis (engineering)|Risk analysis]] can be used to choose between adaptive (''agile'' or ''value-driven'') and predictive (''plan-driven'') methods.<ref name=\"PMBridgeToAgility\">{{Cite book |last1=Sliger |first1=Michele |last2=Broderick |first2=Stacia |title=The Software Project Manager's Bridge to Agility |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-321-50275-9 |page=46 }}</ref> [[Barry Boehm]] and [[Richard Turner (computer scientist)|Richard Turner]] suggest that each side of the continuum has its own ''home ground'', as follows:<ref name=\"boehm2004\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Home grounds of different development methods\n|-\n! style=\"width: 33%\" | Value-driven methods\n! style=\"width: 33%\" | Plan-driven methods\n!

In the [[waterfall model]], there is always a separate '''''testing phase''''' after a '''''build phase'''''; however, in agile software development testing is completed in the same iteration as programming. \n\nAnother difference is that traditional \"waterfall\" software development moves a project through various Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) phases. One phase is completed in its entirety before moving on to the next phase.\n\nBecause testing is done in every iteration\u2014which develops a small piece of the software\u2014users can frequently use those new pieces of software and validate the value. After the users know the real value of the updated piece of software, they can make better decisions about the software's future. Having a value retrospective and software re-planning session in each iteration\u2014[[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] typically has iterations of just two weeks\u2014helps the team continuously adapt its plans so as to maximize the value it delivers. This follows a pattern similar to the [[PDCA]] cycle, as the work is ''planned'', ''done'', ''checked'' (in the review and retrospective), and any changes agreed are ''acted'' upon.\n\nThis iterative approach supports a ''product'' rather than a ''project'' mindset. This provides greater flexibility throughout the development process; whereas on projects the requirements are defined and locked down from the very beginning, making it difficult to change them later. Iterative product development allows the software to evolve in response to changes in business environment or market requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/at-the-kickoff-project-development-vs-product-development/|title=At the Kickoff: Project Development vs Product Development|date=12 February 2016|website=AltexSoft Inc.|access-date=31 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the short iteration style of agile software development, it also has strong connections with the [[lean startup]] concept.\n\n=== Code vs. documentation ===\nIn a letter to ''[[Computer (magazine)|IEEE Computer]]'', Steven Rakitin expressed cynicism about agile software development, calling it \"yet another attempt to undermine the discipline of software engineering\" and translating \"working software over comprehensive documentation\" as \"we want to spend all our time coding.

Washington: OOPSLA 2002</ref>\n\nWhen agile software development is applied in a distributed setting (with teams dispersed across multiple business locations), it is commonly referred to as distributed agile development. The goal is to leverage the unique benefits offered by each approach. Distributed development allows organizations to build software by strategically setting up teams in different parts of the globe, virtually building software round-the-clock (more commonly referred to as follow-the-sun model). On the other hand, agile development provides increased transparency, continuous feedback and more flexibility when responding to changes.\n\n=== Regulated domains ===\n\nAgile software development methods were initially seen as best suitable for non-critical product developments, thereby excluded from use in regulated domains such as medical devices, pharmaceutical, financial, nuclear systems, automotive, and avionics sectors, etc. However, in the last several years, there have been several initiatives for the adaptation of agile methods for these domains.<ref name=\"Cawley2010\">{{Cite book|title = Lean/Agile Software Development Methodologies in Regulated Environments \u2013 State of the Art|journal = Lean Enterprise Software and Systems|date = 2010|isbn = 978-3-642-16415-6|pages = 31\u201336|series = Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing|volume = 65|first = Ois\u00edn|last = Cawley|first2 = Xiaofeng|last2 = Wang|first3 = Ita|last3 = Richardson|editor-first = Pekka|editor-last = Abrahamsson|editor2-first = Nilay|editor2-last = Oza|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-16416-3_4|hdl = 10344/683}}</ref><ref name=\"McHugh2014\">{{Cite book|title = An Agile Implementation within a Medical Device Software Organisation|journal = Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination|date = 2014-11-04|isbn = 978-3-319-13035-4|pages = 190\u2013201|series = Communications in Computer and Information Science|volume = 477|first = Martin|last = McHugh|first2 = Fergal|last2 = McCaffery|first3 = Garret|last3 = Coady|editor-first = Antanas|editor-last = Mitasiunas|editor2-first = Terry|editor2-last = Rout|editor3-first = Rory V.|editor3-last = O'Connor|editor4-first = Alec|editor4-last = Dorling| display-editors = 3|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-13036-1_17|url = https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1152&context=scschcomcon}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Wang|first=Yang|last2=Ramadani|first2=Jasmin|last3=Wagner|first3=Stefan|date=2017-11-29|title=An Exploratory Study on Applying a Scrum Development Process for Safety-Critical Systems|journal=Product-Focused Software Process Improvement|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|volume=10611|pages=324\u2013340|arxiv=1703.05375|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-69926-4_23|isbn=9783319699257|bibcode=2017arXiv170305375W}}</ref><ref name=\"SafeScrum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sintef.no/safescrum |title=SafeScrum - SINTEF |publisher=Sintef.no |date= |accessdate=2019-03-26}}</ref><ref>Thor Myklebust, Tor St\u00e5lhane, Geir Kjetil Hanssen, Tormod Wien and B\u00f8rge Haugset: Scrum, documentation and the IEC 61508-3:2010 software standard, http://www.sintef.no/globalassets/ec-61508-documentation-and-safescrum-psam12.pdf</ref>\n\nThere are numerous standards that may apply in regulated domains, including [[ISO 26262]], [[ISO 9000]], [[ISO 9001]], and [[ISO/IEC 15504]].\nA number of key concerns are of particular importance in regulated domains:<ref name=\"Fitzgerald2013\">{{Cite book|title = Scaling agile methods to regulated environments: An industry case study|journal = 2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)|date = May 2013|pages = 863\u2013872|doi = 10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606635|first = B.|last = Fitzgerald|first2 = K.-J.|last2 = Stol|first3 = R.|last3 = O'Sullivan|first4 = D.|last4 = O'Brien|isbn = 978-1-4673-3076-3|hdl = 10344/3055}}</ref>\n\n* [[Quality assurance]] (QA): Systematic and inherent quality management underpinning a controlled professional process and reliability and correctness of product.\n* Safety and security: Formal planning and risk management to mitigate safety risks for users and securely protecting users from unintentional and malicious misuse.\n*[[Traceability]]: Documentation providing auditable evidence of regulatory compliance and facilitating traceability and investigation of problems.\n* [[Verification and Validation]] (V&V): Embedded throughout the software development process (e.g. user requirements specification, functional specification, design specification, code review, unit tests, integration tests, system tests).\n\n==Experience and adoption==\nAlthough agile software development methods can be used with any programming paradigm or language in practice, they were originally closely associated with object-oriented environments such as Smalltalk and Lisp and later Java. The initial adopters of agile methods were usually small to medium-sized teams working on unprecedented systems with requirements that were difficult to finalize and likely to change as the system was being developed.

Below are some common examples:\n\n====Lack of overall product design====\nA goal of agile software development is to focus more on producing working software and less on documentation. This is in contrast to waterfall models where the process is often highly controlled and minor changes to the system require significant revision of supporting documentation. However, this does not justify completely doing without any analysis or design at all. Failure to pay attention to design can cause a team to proceed rapidly at first but then to have significant rework required as they attempt to scale up the system. One of the key features of agile software development is that it is iterative. When done correctly design emerges as the system is developed and commonalities and opportunities for re-use are discovered.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beck|first1=Kent|title=Extreme Programming Explained|date=2000|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0201616415|pages=[https://archive.org/details/extremeprogrammi00beck/page/48 48\u201349]|url=https://archive.org/details/extremeprogrammi00beck/page/48}}</ref>\n\n====Adding stories to an iteration in progress====\n\nIn agile software development, ''stories'' (similar to [[use case]] descriptions) are typically used to define requirements and an ''iteration'' is a short period of time during which the team commits to specific goals.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Margaret|title=Sprint (software development) definition|url=http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Scrum-sprint|website=searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref> Adding stories to an iteration in progress is detrimental to a good flow of work. These should be added to the product backlog and prioritized for a subsequent iteration or in rare cases the iteration could be cancelled.<ref name=\"axisagile.com.au\">{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Ilan|title=Sprint issues \u2013 when sprints turn into crawls|url=http://www.axisagile.com.au/blog/planning-and-metrics/sprint-issues-when-sprints-turn-into-crawls/|website=www.axisagile.com.au|accessdate=2014-06-08|date=11 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis does not mean that a story cannot expand. Teams must deal with new information, which may produce additional tasks for a story. If the new information prevents the story from being completed during the iteration, then it should be carried over to a subsequent iteration. However, it should be prioritized against all remaining stories, as the new information may have changed the story's original priority.\n\n====Lack of sponsor support====\n\nAgile software development is often implemented as a grassroots effort in organizations by software development teams trying to optimize their development processes and ensure consistency in the software development life cycle. By not having sponsor support, teams may face difficulties and resistance from business partners, other development teams and management. Additionally, they may suffer without appropriate funding and resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agile-only.com/master-thesis/project-mgmt/pr-and-rd|title=Project Roles and Responsibility Distribution|website=agile-only.com|accessdate=2014-06-15}}</ref> This increases the likelihood of failure.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bourne|first1=Lynda|title=What Does a Project Sponsor Really Do?|url=http://blogs.pmi.org/blog/voices_on_project_management/2012/04/what-does-a-project-sponsor-re.html|website=blogs.pmi.org|accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref>\n\n====Insufficient training====\n\nA survey performed by VersionOne found respondents cited insufficient training as the most significant cause for failed agile implementations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.versionone.com/state_of_agile_development_survey/09/page5.asp|title=9th State of Agile Report|website=Stage of Agile Survey|publisher=VersionOne|accessdate=2014-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112225122/http://www.versionone.com/state_of_agile_development_survey/09/page5.asp|archive-date=12 January 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Teams have fallen into the trap of assuming the reduced processes of agile software development compared to other methodologies such as waterfall means that there are no actual rules for agile software development. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n====Product owner role is not properly filled====\n\nThe [[product owner]] is responsible for representing the business in the development activity and is often the most demanding role.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sims, Chris |author2=Johnson, Hillary Louise |title=The Elements of Scrum|date=2011-02-15|publisher=Dymaxicon|page=73|edition=Kindle}}</ref>\n\nA common mistake is to have the product owner role filled by someone from the development team. This requires the team to make its own decisions on prioritization without real feedback from the business. They try to solve business issues internally or delay work as they reach outside the team for direction. This often leads to distraction and a breakdown in collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rothman|first1=Johanna Rothman|title=When You Have No Product Owner At All|url=http://www.jrothman.com/blog/mpd/2011/08/when-you-have-no-product-owner-at-all.html|website=www.jrothman.com|accessdate=2014-06-08|date=25 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Teams are not focused====\n\nAgile software development requires teams to meet product commitments, which means they should focus only on work for that product. However, team members who appear to have spare capacity are often expected to take on other work, which makes it difficult for them to help complete the work to which their team had committed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Alyssa|title=Working on Multiple Agile Teams|url=http://techwhirl.com/working-multiple-agile-teams/|website=techwhirl.com/|accessdate=2014-06-14|date=8 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Excessive preparation/planning====\n\nTeams may fall into the trap of spending too much time preparing or planning. This is a common trap for teams less familiar with agile software development where the teams feel obliged to have a complete understanding and specification of all stories. Teams should be prepared to move forward only with those stories in which they have confidence, then during the iteration continue to discover and prepare work for subsequent iterations (often referred to as [[refinement (computing)|backlog refinement]] or grooming).\n\n====Problem-solving in the daily standup====\n\nA daily standup should be a focused, timely meeting where all team members disseminate information. If problem-solving occurs, it often can only involve certain team members and potentially is not the best use of the entire team's time. If during the daily standup the team starts diving into problem-solving, it should be set aside until a sub-team can discuss, usually immediately after the standup completes. <ref>{{cite web|title=Daily Scrum Meeting|url=http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum|website=www.mountaingoatsoftware.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\n====Assigning tasks====\n\nOne of the intended benefits of agile software development is to empower the team to make choices, as they are closest to the problem. Additionally, they should make choices as close to implementation as possible, to use more timely information in the decision. If team members are assigned tasks by others or too early in the process, the benefits of localized and timely decision making can be lost.<ref name=\"Effective Sprint Planning\">{{cite web|last1=May |first1=Robert |title=Effective Sprint Planning |url=http://www.agileexecutives.org/Blogs/tabid/66/EntryId/18/Effective-Sprint-Planning.aspx |website=www.agileexecutives.org |accessdate=2014-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628102810/http://www.agileexecutives.org/Blogs/tabid/66/EntryId/18/Effective-Sprint-Planning.aspx |archivedate=28 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nBeing assigned work also constrains team members into certain roles (for example, team member A must always do the database work), which limits opportunities for cross-training.<ref name=\"Effective Sprint Planning\"/> Team members themselves can choose to take on tasks that stretch their abilities and provide cross-training opportunities.\n\n====Scrum master as a contributor====\n\nAnother common pitfall is for a scrum master to act as a contributor. While not prohibited by the Scrum methodology, the scrum master needs to ensure they have the capacity to act in the role of scrum master first and not working on development tasks. A scrum master's role is to facilitate the process rather than create the product.<ref name=\"agileconnection.com\">{{cite web|last1=Berczuk|first1=Steve|title=Mission Possible: ScrumMaster and Technical Contributor|url=http://www.agileconnection.com/article/mission-possible-scrummaster-and-technical-contributor?page=0%2C1|website=www.agileconnection.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\nHaving the scrum master also multitasking may result in too many context switches to be productive. Additionally, as a scrum master is responsible for ensuring roadblocks are removed so that the team can make forward progress, the benefit gained by individual tasks moving forward may not outweigh roadblocks that are deferred due to lack of capacity.<ref name=\"agileconnection.com\"/>\n\n====Lack of test automation====\n\nDue to the iterative nature of agile development, multiple rounds of testing are often needed. Automated testing helps reduce the impact of repeated unit, integration, and regression tests and frees developers and testers to focus on higher value work.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Namta|first1=Rajneesh|title=Thoughts on Test Automation in Agile|url=http://www.infoq.com/articles/thoughts-on-test-automation-in-agile|website=www.infoq.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\nTest automation also supports continued [[refactoring]] required by iterative software development. Allowing a developer to quickly run tests to confirm refactoring has not modified the functionality of the application may reduce the workload and increase confidence that cleanup efforts have not introduced new defects.\n\n====Allowing technical debt to build up====\n\nFocusing on delivering new functionality may result in increased [[technical debt]]. The team must allow themselves time for defect remediation and refactoring. Technical debt hinders planning abilities by increasing the amount of unscheduled work as production defects distract the team from further progress.<ref name=\"Technical Debt + Red October\">{{cite web|last1 = Band|first1 = Zvi|title = Technical Debt + Red October|url = http://zviband.com/posts/technical-debt-red-october/|accessdate = 8 June 2014|date = 22 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs the system evolves it is important to [[Code refactoring|refactor]] as entropy of the system naturally increases.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shore|first1=James|title=The Art of Agile Development: Refactoring|url=http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/refactoring.html|website=www.jamesshore.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref> Over time the lack of constant maintenance causes increasing defects and development costs.<ref name=\"Technical Debt + Red October\"/>\n\n====Attempting to take on too much in an iteration====\nA common misconception is that agile software development allows continuous change, however an iteration backlog is an agreement of what work can be completed during an iteration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Step 4: Sprint Planning (Tasks)|url=http://www.allaboutagile.com/how-to-implement-scrum-in-10-easy-steps-step-4-sprint-planning-tasks/|website=www.allaboutagile.com|accessdate=2014-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629145319/http://www.allaboutagile.com/how-to-implement-scrum-in-10-easy-steps-step-4-sprint-planning-tasks/|archive-date=29 June 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Having too much [[Work in process|work-in-progress (WIP)]] results in inefficiencies such as context-switching and queueing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leankit.com/blog/2014/03/limiting-work-in-progress/|title=Why Limiting Your Work-in-Progress Matters|website=leankit.com|last1=George|first1=Claire|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref> The team must avoid feeling pressured into taking on additional work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/sprint-planning-meeting/|website=www.mountaingoatsoftware.com|accessdate=2014-06-14|title=Sprint Planning Meeting}}</ref>\n\n====Fixed time, resources, scope, and quality====\nAgile software development fixes time (iteration duration), quality, and ideally resources in advance (though maintaining fixed resources may be difficult if developers are often pulled away from tasks to handle production incidents), while the scope remains variable. The customer or product owner often push for a fixed scope for an iteration. However, teams should be reluctant to commit to the locked time, resources and scope (commonly known as the [[project management triangle]]). Efforts to add scope to the fixed time and resources of agile software development may result in decreased quality.<ref name=\"adeptechllc.com\">{{cite web|last1=McMillan |first1=Keith |title=Time, Resources, Scope... and Quality. |url=http://www.adeptechllc.com/2010/05/13/time-resources-scope-and-quality/ |website=www.adeptechllc.com |accessdate=2014-06-15 }}</ref>\n\n====Developer burnout====\nDue to the focused pace and continuous nature of agile practices, there is a heightened risk of burnout among members of the delivery team.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Current study on limitations of Agile|journal=Procedia Computer Science|volume=78|pages=291\u2013297|last=|first=|date=January 2016|doi=10.1016/j.procs.2016.02.056|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Agile management ==\n{{main|Agile management}}\nThe term ''agile management'' is applied to an iterative, incremental method of managing the design and build activities of engineering, information technology and other business areas that aim to provide new product or service development in a highly flexible and interactive manner, based on the principles expressed in the ''Manifesto for Agile Software Development''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Managing Agile: Strategy, Implementation, Organisation and People |last=Moran |first=Alan|publisher=Springer |date=2015|isbn=978-3-319-16262-1}}</ref>\n\nAgile X techniques may also be called [[extreme project management]]. It is a variant of [[iterative and incremental development|iterative life cycle]]<ref>ExecutiveBrief, [http://www.pmhut.com/which-life-cycle-is-best-for-your-project Which Life Cycle Is Best For Your Project?], PM Hut. Accessed 23 October 2009.</ref> where [[deliverable]]s are submitted in stages. The main difference between agile and iterative development is that agile methods complete small portions of the deliverables in each delivery cycle (iteration),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.versionone.com/agile-project-management/ | title=Agile Project Management | publisher=VersionOne | accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> while iterative methods evolve the entire set of deliverables over time, completing them near the end of the project. Both iterative and agile methods were developed as a reaction to various obstacles that developed in more sequential forms of project organization. For example, as technology projects grow in complexity, end users tend to have difficulty defining the long-term requirements without being able to view progressive prototypes. Projects that develop in iterations can constantly gather feedback to help refine those requirements.\n\nAgile management also offers a simple framework promoting communication and reflection on past [[Work (project management)|work]] amongst [[Project team|team]] members.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.project-laneways.com.au/certification-courses/agilepm/what-is-agile-management | title=What is Agile Management? | publisher=Project Laneways | accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> Teams who were using traditional waterfall planning and adopted the agile way of development typically go through a transformation phase and often take help from agile coaches who help guide the teams through a smooth transformation. There are typically two styles of agile coaching: push-based and [[pull-based agile coaching]]. Agile management approaches have also been employed and adapted to the business and government sectors. For example, within the [[federal government of the United States]], the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) is employing a [[collaborative project management]] approach that focuses on incorporating [[collaborating, learning and adapting]] (CLA) strategies to iterate and adapt programming.<ref>USAID.

One key of adaptive development methods is a [[Rolling Wave planning|''rolling wave'']] approach to schedule planning, which identifies milestones but leaves flexibility in the path to reach them, and also allows for the milestones themselves to change.<ref>{{cite book | title=Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide | last=Larman | first=Craig | year=2004 |page=253 | chapter=Chapter 11: Practice Tips |  isbn=9780131111554 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=76rnV5Exs50C&pg=PA253&dq=adaptive%20predictive%20%22rolling%20wave%22#v=onepage&q=adaptive%20predictive%20%22rolling%20wave%22 | accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File: SimulTrain BurnUp Chart.jpg|thumb|Agile Software Development: BurnUp Chart shows the dynamics of created for clients value (story points) in project management simulation [[SimulTrain]].]]\n\n\n\n''Adaptive'' methods focus on adapting quickly to changing realities. When the needs of a project change, an adaptive team changes as well. An adaptive team has difficulty describing exactly what will happen in the future. The further away a date is, the more vague an adaptive method is about what will happen on that date. An adaptive team cannot report exactly what tasks they will do next week, but only which features they plan for next month. When asked about a release six months from now, an adaptive team might be able to report only the mission statement for the release, or a statement of expected value vs. cost.\n\n''Predictive'' methods, in contrast, focus on analysing and planning the future in detail and cater for known risks. In the extremes, a predictive team can report exactly what features and tasks are planned for the entire length of the development process. Predictive methods rely on effective early phase analysis and if this goes very wrong, the project may have difficulty changing direction. Predictive teams often institute a [[change control board]] to ensure they consider only the most valuable changes.\n\n[[Risk analysis (engineering)|Risk analysis]] can be used to choose between adaptive (''agile'' or ''value-driven'') and predictive (''plan-driven'') methods.<ref name=\"PMBridgeToAgility\">{{Cite book |last1=Sliger |first1=Michele |last2=Broderick |first2=Stacia |title=The Software Project Manager's Bridge to Agility |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-321-50275-9 |page=46 }}</ref> [[Barry Boehm]] and [[Richard Turner (computer scientist)|Richard Turner]] suggest that each side of the continuum has its own ''home ground'', as follows:<ref name=\"boehm2004\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Home grounds of different development methods\n|-\n! style=\"width: 33%\" | Value-driven methods\n! style=\"width: 33%\" | Plan-driven methods\n!

In the [[waterfall model]], there is always a separate '''''testing phase''''' after a '''''build phase'''''; however, in agile software development testing is completed in the same iteration as programming. \n\nAnother difference is that traditional \"waterfall\" software development moves a project through various Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) phases. One phase is completed in its entirety before moving on to the next phase.\n\nBecause testing is done in every iteration\u2014which develops a small piece of the software\u2014users can frequently use those new pieces of software and validate the value. After the users know the real value of the updated piece of software, they can make better decisions about the software's future. Having a value retrospective and software re-planning session in each iteration\u2014[[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] typically has iterations of just two weeks\u2014helps the team continuously adapt its plans so as to maximize the value it delivers. This follows a pattern similar to the [[PDCA]] cycle, as the work is ''planned'', ''done'', ''checked'' (in the review and retrospective), and any changes agreed are ''acted'' upon.\n\nThis iterative approach supports a ''product'' rather than a ''project'' mindset. This provides greater flexibility throughout the development process; whereas on projects the requirements are defined and locked down from the very beginning, making it difficult to change them later. Iterative product development allows the software to evolve in response to changes in business environment or market requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/at-the-kickoff-project-development-vs-product-development/|title=At the Kickoff: Project Development vs Product Development|date=12 February 2016|website=AltexSoft Inc.|access-date=31 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the short iteration style of agile software development, it also has strong connections with the [[lean startup]] concept.\n\n=== Code vs. documentation ===\nIn a letter to ''[[Computer (magazine)|IEEE Computer]]'', Steven Rakitin expressed cynicism about agile software development, calling it \"yet another attempt to undermine the discipline of software engineering\" and translating \"working software over comprehensive documentation\" as \"we want to spend all our time coding.

Washington: OOPSLA 2002</ref>\n\nWhen agile software development is applied in a distributed setting (with teams dispersed across multiple business locations), it is commonly referred to as distributed agile development. The goal is to leverage the unique benefits offered by each approach. Distributed development allows organizations to build software by strategically setting up teams in different parts of the globe, virtually building software round-the-clock (more commonly referred to as follow-the-sun model). On the other hand, agile development provides increased transparency, continuous feedback and more flexibility when responding to changes.\n\n=== Regulated domains ===\n\nAgile software development methods were initially seen as best suitable for non-critical product developments, thereby excluded from use in regulated domains such as medical devices, pharmaceutical, financial, nuclear systems, automotive, and avionics sectors, etc. However, in the last several years, there have been several initiatives for the adaptation of agile methods for these domains.<ref name=\"Cawley2010\">{{Cite book|title = Lean/Agile Software Development Methodologies in Regulated Environments \u2013 State of the Art|journal = Lean Enterprise Software and Systems|date = 2010|isbn = 978-3-642-16415-6|pages = 31\u201336|series = Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing|volume = 65|first = Ois\u00edn|last = Cawley|first2 = Xiaofeng|last2 = Wang|first3 = Ita|last3 = Richardson|editor-first = Pekka|editor-last = Abrahamsson|editor2-first = Nilay|editor2-last = Oza|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-16416-3_4|hdl = 10344/683}}</ref><ref name=\"McHugh2014\">{{Cite book|title = An Agile Implementation within a Medical Device Software Organisation|journal = Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination|date = 2014-11-04|isbn = 978-3-319-13035-4|pages = 190\u2013201|series = Communications in Computer and Information Science|volume = 477|first = Martin|last = McHugh|first2 = Fergal|last2 = McCaffery|first3 = Garret|last3 = Coady|editor-first = Antanas|editor-last = Mitasiunas|editor2-first = Terry|editor2-last = Rout|editor3-first = Rory V.|editor3-last = O'Connor|editor4-first = Alec|editor4-last = Dorling| display-editors = 3|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-13036-1_17|url = https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1152&context=scschcomcon}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Wang|first=Yang|last2=Ramadani|first2=Jasmin|last3=Wagner|first3=Stefan|date=2017-11-29|title=An Exploratory Study on Applying a Scrum Development Process for Safety-Critical Systems|journal=Product-Focused Software Process Improvement|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|volume=10611|pages=324\u2013340|arxiv=1703.05375|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-69926-4_23|isbn=9783319699257|bibcode=2017arXiv170305375W}}</ref><ref name=\"SafeScrum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sintef.no/safescrum |title=SafeScrum - SINTEF |publisher=Sintef.no |date= |accessdate=2019-03-26}}</ref><ref>Thor Myklebust, Tor St\u00e5lhane, Geir Kjetil Hanssen, Tormod Wien and B\u00f8rge Haugset: Scrum, documentation and the IEC 61508-3:2010 software standard, http://www.sintef.no/globalassets/ec-61508-documentation-and-safescrum-psam12.pdf</ref>\n\nThere are numerous standards that may apply in regulated domains, including [[ISO 26262]], [[ISO 9000]], [[ISO 9001]], and [[ISO/IEC 15504]].\nA number of key concerns are of particular importance in regulated domains:<ref name=\"Fitzgerald2013\">{{Cite book|title = Scaling agile methods to regulated environments: An industry case study|journal = 2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)|date = May 2013|pages = 863\u2013872|doi = 10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606635|first = B.|last = Fitzgerald|first2 = K.-J.|last2 = Stol|first3 = R.|last3 = O'Sullivan|first4 = D.|last4 = O'Brien|isbn = 978-1-4673-3076-3|hdl = 10344/3055}}</ref>\n\n* [[Quality assurance]] (QA): Systematic and inherent quality management underpinning a controlled professional process and reliability and correctness of product.\n* Safety and security: Formal planning and risk management to mitigate safety risks for users and securely protecting users from unintentional and malicious misuse.\n*[[Traceability]]: Documentation providing auditable evidence of regulatory compliance and facilitating traceability and investigation of problems.\n* [[Verification and Validation]] (V&V): Embedded throughout the software development process (e.g. user requirements specification, functional specification, design specification, code review, unit tests, integration tests, system tests).\n\n==Experience and adoption==\nAlthough agile software development methods can be used with any programming paradigm or language in practice, they were originally closely associated with object-oriented environments such as Smalltalk and Lisp and later Java.

Below are some common examples:\n\n====Lack of overall product design====\nA goal of agile software development is to focus more on producing working software and less on documentation. This is in contrast to waterfall models where the process is often highly controlled and minor changes to the system require significant revision of supporting documentation. However, this does not justify completely doing without any analysis or design at all. Failure to pay attention to design can cause a team to proceed rapidly at first but then to have significant rework required as they attempt to scale up the system. One of the key features of agile software development is that it is iterative. When done correctly design emerges as the system is developed and commonalities and opportunities for re-use are discovered.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beck|first1=Kent|title=Extreme Programming Explained|date=2000|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0201616415|pages=[https://archive.org/details/extremeprogrammi00beck/page/48 48\u201349]|url=https://archive.org/details/extremeprogrammi00beck/page/48}}</ref>\n\n====Adding stories to an iteration in progress====\n\nIn agile software development, ''stories'' (similar to [[use case]] descriptions) are typically used to define requirements and an ''iteration'' is a short period of time during which the team commits to specific goals.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Margaret|title=Sprint (software development) definition|url=http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Scrum-sprint|website=searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref> Adding stories to an iteration in progress is detrimental to a good flow of work.

If the new information prevents the story from being completed during the iteration, then it should be carried over to a subsequent iteration. However, it should be prioritized against all remaining stories, as the new information may have changed the story's original priority.\n\n====Lack of sponsor support====\n\nAgile software development is often implemented as a grassroots effort in organizations by software development teams trying to optimize their development processes and ensure consistency in the software development life cycle. By not having sponsor support, teams may face difficulties and resistance from business partners, other development teams and management. Additionally, they may suffer without appropriate funding and resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agile-only.com/master-thesis/project-mgmt/pr-and-rd|title=Project Roles and Responsibility Distribution|website=agile-only.com|accessdate=2014-06-15}}</ref> This increases the likelihood of failure.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bourne|first1=Lynda|title=What Does a Project Sponsor Really Do?|url=http://blogs.pmi.org/blog/voices_on_project_management/2012/04/what-does-a-project-sponsor-re.html|website=blogs.pmi.org|accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref>\n\n====Insufficient training====\n\nA survey performed by VersionOne found respondents cited insufficient training as the most significant cause for failed agile implementations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.versionone.com/state_of_agile_development_survey/09/page5.asp|title=9th State of Agile Report|website=Stage of Agile Survey|publisher=VersionOne|accessdate=2014-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112225122/http://www.versionone.com/state_of_agile_development_survey/09/page5.asp|archive-date=12 January 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Teams have fallen into the trap of assuming the reduced processes of agile software development compared to other methodologies such as waterfall means that there are no actual rules for agile software development. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n====Product owner role is not properly filled====\n\nThe [[product owner]] is responsible for representing the business in the development activity and is often the most demanding role.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sims, Chris |author2=Johnson, Hillary Louise |title=The Elements of Scrum|date=2011-02-15|publisher=Dymaxicon|page=73|edition=Kindle}}</ref>\n\nA common mistake is to have the product owner role filled by someone from the development team. This requires the team to make its own decisions on prioritization without real feedback from the business. They try to solve business issues internally or delay work as they reach outside the team for direction. This often leads to distraction and a breakdown in collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rothman|first1=Johanna Rothman|title=When You Have No Product Owner At All|url=http://www.jrothman.com/blog/mpd/2011/08/when-you-have-no-product-owner-at-all.html|website=www.jrothman.com|accessdate=2014-06-08|date=25 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Teams are not focused====\n\nAgile software development requires teams to meet product commitments, which means they should focus only on work for that product. However, team members who appear to have spare capacity are often expected to take on other work, which makes it difficult for them to help complete the work to which their team had committed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Alyssa|title=Working on Multiple Agile Teams|url=http://techwhirl.com/working-multiple-agile-teams/|website=techwhirl.com/|accessdate=2014-06-14|date=8 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Excessive preparation/planning====\n\nTeams may fall into the trap of spending too much time preparing or planning. This is a common trap for teams less familiar with agile software development where the teams feel obliged to have a complete understanding and specification of all stories. Teams should be prepared to move forward only with those stories in which they have confidence, then during the iteration continue to discover and prepare work for subsequent iterations (often referred to as [[refinement (computing)|backlog refinement]] or grooming).\n\n====Problem-solving in the daily standup====\n\nA daily standup should be a focused, timely meeting where all team members disseminate information. If problem-solving occurs, it often can only involve certain team members and potentially is not the best use of the entire team's time. If during the daily standup the team starts diving into problem-solving, it should be set aside until a sub-team can discuss, usually immediately after the standup completes. <ref>{{cite web|title=Daily Scrum Meeting|url=http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum|website=www.mountaingoatsoftware.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\n====Assigning tasks====\n\nOne of the intended benefits of agile software development is to empower the team to make choices, as they are closest to the problem. Additionally, they should make choices as close to implementation as possible, to use more timely information in the decision. If team members are assigned tasks by others or too early in the process, the benefits of localized and timely decision making can be lost.<ref name=\"Effective Sprint Planning\">{{cite web|last1=May |first1=Robert |title=Effective Sprint Planning |url=http://www.agileexecutives.org/Blogs/tabid/66/EntryId/18/Effective-Sprint-Planning.aspx |website=www.agileexecutives.org |accessdate=2014-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628102810/http://www.agileexecutives.org/Blogs/tabid/66/EntryId/18/Effective-Sprint-Planning.aspx |archivedate=28 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nBeing assigned work also constrains team members into certain roles (for example, team member A must always do the database work), which limits opportunities for cross-training.<ref name=\"Effective Sprint Planning\"/> Team members themselves can choose to take on tasks that stretch their abilities and provide cross-training opportunities.\n\n====Scrum master as a contributor====\n\nAnother common pitfall is for a scrum master to act as a contributor. While not prohibited by the Scrum methodology, the scrum master needs to ensure they have the capacity to act in the role of scrum master first and not working on development tasks. A scrum master's role is to facilitate the process rather than create the product.<ref name=\"agileconnection.com\">{{cite web|last1=Berczuk|first1=Steve|title=Mission Possible: ScrumMaster and Technical Contributor|url=http://www.agileconnection.com/article/mission-possible-scrummaster-and-technical-contributor?page=0%2C1|website=www.agileconnection.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\nHaving the scrum master also multitasking may result in too many context switches to be productive. Additionally, as a scrum master is responsible for ensuring roadblocks are removed so that the team can make forward progress, the benefit gained by individual tasks moving forward may not outweigh roadblocks that are deferred due to lack of capacity.<ref name=\"agileconnection.com\"/>\n\n====Lack of test automation====\n\nDue to the iterative nature of agile development, multiple rounds of testing are often needed. Automated testing helps reduce the impact of repeated unit, integration, and regression tests and frees developers and testers to focus on higher value work.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Namta|first1=Rajneesh|title=Thoughts on Test Automation in Agile|url=http://www.infoq.com/articles/thoughts-on-test-automation-in-agile|website=www.infoq.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref>\n\nTest automation also supports continued [[refactoring]] required by iterative software development. Allowing a developer to quickly run tests to confirm refactoring has not modified the functionality of the application may reduce the workload and increase confidence that cleanup efforts have not introduced new defects.\n\n====Allowing technical debt to build up====\n\nFocusing on delivering new functionality may result in increased [[technical debt]]. The team must allow themselves time for defect remediation and refactoring. Technical debt hinders planning abilities by increasing the amount of unscheduled work as production defects distract the team from further progress.<ref name=\"Technical Debt + Red October\">{{cite web|last1 = Band|first1 = Zvi|title = Technical Debt + Red October|url = http://zviband.com/posts/technical-debt-red-october/|accessdate = 8 June 2014|date = 22 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs the system evolves it is important to [[Code refactoring|refactor]] as entropy of the system naturally increases.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shore|first1=James|title=The Art of Agile Development: Refactoring|url=http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/refactoring.html|website=www.jamesshore.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref> Over time the lack of constant maintenance causes increasing defects and development costs.<ref name=\"Technical Debt + Red October\"/>\n\n====Attempting to take on too much in an iteration====\nA common misconception is that agile software development allows continuous change, however an iteration backlog is an agreement of what work can be completed during an iteration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Step 4: Sprint Planning (Tasks)|url=http://www.allaboutagile.com/how-to-implement-scrum-in-10-easy-steps-step-4-sprint-planning-tasks/|website=www.allaboutagile.com|accessdate=2014-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629145319/http://www.allaboutagile.com/how-to-implement-scrum-in-10-easy-steps-step-4-sprint-planning-tasks/|archive-date=29 June 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Having too much [[Work in process|work-in-progress (WIP)]] results in inefficiencies such as context-switching and queueing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leankit.com/blog/2014/03/limiting-work-in-progress/|title=Why Limiting Your Work-in-Progress Matters|website=leankit.com|last1=George|first1=Claire|accessdate=2014-06-14}}</ref> The team must avoid feeling pressured into taking on additional work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/sprint-planning-meeting/|website=www.mountaingoatsoftware.com|accessdate=2014-06-14|title=Sprint Planning Meeting}}</ref>\n\n====Fixed time, resources, scope, and quality====\nAgile software development fixes time (iteration duration), quality, and ideally resources in advance (though maintaining fixed resources may be difficult if developers are often pulled away from tasks to handle production incidents), while the scope remains variable. The customer or product owner often push for a fixed scope for an iteration. However, teams should be reluctant to commit to the locked time, resources and scope (commonly known as the [[project management triangle]]). Efforts to add scope to the fixed time and resources of agile software development may result in decreased quality.<ref name=\"adeptechllc.com\">{{cite web|last1=McMillan |first1=Keith |title=Time, Resources, Scope... and Quality. |url=http://www.adeptechllc.com/2010/05/13/time-resources-scope-and-quality/ |website=www.adeptechllc.com |accessdate=2014-06-15 }}</ref>\n\n====Developer burnout====\nDue to the focused pace and continuous nature of agile practices, there is a heightened risk of burnout among members of the delivery team.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Current study on limitations of Agile|journal=Procedia Computer Science|volume=78|pages=291\u2013297|last=|first=|date=January 2016|doi=10.1016/j.procs.2016.02.056|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Agile management ==\n{{main|Agile management}}\nThe term ''agile management'' is applied to an iterative, incremental method of managing the design and build activities of engineering, information technology and other business areas that aim to provide new product or service development in a highly flexible and interactive manner, based on the principles expressed in the ''Manifesto for Agile Software Development''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Managing Agile: Strategy, Implementation, Organisation and People |last=Moran |first=Alan|publisher=Springer |date=2015|isbn=978-3-319-16262-1}}</ref>\n\nAgile X techniques may also be called [[extreme project management]]. It is a variant of [[iterative and incremental development|iterative life cycle]]<ref>ExecutiveBrief, [http://www.pmhut.com/which-life-cycle-is-best-for-your-project Which Life Cycle Is Best For Your Project?], PM Hut. Accessed 23 October 2009.</ref> where [[deliverable]]s are submitted in stages. The main difference between agile and iterative development is that agile methods complete small portions of the deliverables in each delivery cycle (iteration),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.versionone.com/agile-project-management/ | title=Agile Project Management | publisher=VersionOne | accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> while iterative methods evolve the entire set of deliverables over time, completing them near the end of the project. Both iterative and agile methods were developed as a reaction to various obstacles that developed in more sequential forms of project organization. For example, as technology projects grow in complexity, end users tend to have difficulty defining the long-term requirements without being able to view progressive prototypes. Projects that develop in iterations can constantly gather feedback to help refine those requirements.\n\nAgile management also offers a simple framework promoting communication and reflection on past [[Work (project management)|work]] amongst [[Project team|team]] members.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.project-laneways.com.au/certification-courses/agilepm/what-is-agile-management | title=What is Agile Management? | publisher=Project Laneways | accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> Teams who were using traditional waterfall planning and adopted the agile way of development typically go through a transformation phase and often take help from agile coaches who help guide the teams through a smooth transformation. There are typically two styles of agile coaching: push-based and [[pull-based agile coaching]]. Agile management approaches have also been employed and adapted to the business and government sectors. For example, within the [[federal government of the United States]], the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) is employing a [[collaborative project management]] approach that focuses on incorporating [[collaborating, learning and adapting]] (CLA) strategies to iterate and adapt programming.<ref>USAID.

These products can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes.\n\nAlong with other nuts, almonds can be sprinkled over breakfasts and desserts, particularly [[muesli]] or ice cream-based dishes. Almonds are used in [[marzipan]], [[nougat]], many pastries (including ''[[J\u00e9suite]]s''), cookies (including [[macaron|'' macarons'']], French macaroons), and cakes (including [[Financier (pastry)|financiers]]), ''[[noghl]]'', and other sweets and desserts. They are also used to make [[almond butter]], a spread similar to [[peanut butter]], popular with [[peanut allergy]] sufferers and for its naturally sweeter taste. The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can be eaten whole (green almonds) when they are still green and fleshy on the outside and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, but is a popular snack in parts of the Middle East, eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. Also in the Middle East they are often eaten with dates. They are available only from mid-April to mid-June in the Northern Hemisphere; pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.\n\n[[Almond cookie]]s, Chinese [[almond biscuit]]s, and Italian ''[[ricciarelli]]'' are made with almonds.\n\n*In Greece, ground blanched almonds are used as the base material in a great variety of desserts, usually called ''amygdalota'' (\u03b1\u03bc\u03c5\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03ac). Because of their white color, most are traditionally considered wedding sweets and are served at wedding banquets. In addition, a soft drink known as ''[[soumada]]'' is made from almonds in various regions.\n*In [[Hejaz]], a region of [[Saudi Arabia]], ground almonds are used by adding them with cold milk to a hot coffee cup in addition to cinnamon powder and corn starch to make Almond Coffee ''Gahwat Al-l\u014dz'' (\u0642\u0647\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0648\u0632).\n*In Iran, green almonds are dipped in [[sea salt]] and eaten as snacks on street markets; they are called ''chaqale b\u00e2dam''. Also sweet almonds are used to prepare a special food for babies, named ''harire badam''. Almonds are added to some foods, cookies, and desserts, or are used to decorate foods. People in Iran consume roasted nuts for special events, for example, during New Year ([[Nowruz]]) parties.\n*In Italy, bitter almonds are the traditional base for ''[[Amaretti di Saronno|amaretti]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Amaretto Macaroon|title=Fine Italian Pastries & Biscotti|url=http://www.olivetreetrading.com/product-vicenzi.html|accessdate=10 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512173724/http://www.olivetreetrading.com/product-vicenzi.html|archivedate=12 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vicenzi Amaretto s'Italia (Macaroona)|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H7K5PQ|accessdate=10 April 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713181311/http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H7K5PQ|archivedate=13 July 2015}}</ref> (almond macaroons), a common dessert. Traditionally, a low percentage of bitter almonds (10\u201320%) is added to the ingredients, which gives the cookies their bitter taste (commercially, [[apricot kernel]]s are used as a substitute for bitter almonds). Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in ''[[torrone]]''. In [[Sicily]] ''pasta di mandorle'' (almond paste) is used to make small soft cakes, often decorated with jam, [[pistachio]], or chocolate. Also in Sicily, [[almond milk]] is a popular refreshing beverage in summer.\n*In Morocco, almonds in the form of sweet [[almond paste]] are the main ingredient in pastry fillings, and several other [[List of Moroccan dishes#Desserts|desserts]]. Fried blanched whole almonds are also used to decorate sweet ''[[tajine]]s'' such as lamb with prunes. A drink made from almonds mixed with milk is served in important ceremonies such as weddings and can also be ordered in some cafes. Southwestern Berber regions of [[Essaouira]] and Souss are also known for ''amlou'', a spread made of almond paste, [[argan oil]], and honey. Almond paste is also mixed with toasted flour and among others, honey, olive oil or butter, anise, fennel, sesame seeds, and cinnamon to make ''sellou'' (also called ''zamita'' in [[Meknes]] or ''slilou'' in [[Marrakech]]), a sweet snack known for its long shelf life and high nutritive value.\n*In [[Indian cuisine]], almonds are the base ingredients of ''[[pasanda]]''-style and [[Mughlai]] [[curry|curries]]. ''Badam halva'' is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as ''sohan barfi''), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface. Almonds form the base of various drinks which are supposed to have cooling properties. Almond sherbet or ''sherbet-e-badaam'', is a popular summer drink. Almonds are also sold as a snack with added salt.\n*In Israel almonds are topping [[tahini cookie]] or eaten as a snack.\n\nThe 'Marcona' almond cultivar is recognizably different from other almonds and is marketed by name.<ref name=Gradziel>{{cite book |author=Gradziel, T.M. |year=2011 |title=Horticultural Reviews, Volume 38 |chapter=Origin and Dissemination of Almonds |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |editor=J.

Within the genus ''[[Prunus]]'', it is classified with the [[peach]] in the subgenus ''Amygdalus'', distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell ([[Fruit anatomy#Endocarp|endocarp]]) surrounding the seed.\n\nThe fruit of the almond is a [[drupe]], consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, which is not a [[nut (fruit)|true nut]], inside. Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed. Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled.

These products can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes.\n\nAlong with other nuts, almonds can be sprinkled over breakfasts and desserts, particularly [[muesli]] or ice cream-based dishes. Almonds are used in [[marzipan]], [[nougat]], many pastries (including ''[[J\u00e9suite]]s''), cookies (including [[macaron|'' macarons'']], French macaroons), and cakes (including [[Financier (pastry)|financiers]]), ''[[noghl]]'', and other sweets and desserts. They are also used to make [[almond butter]], a spread similar to [[peanut butter]], popular with [[peanut allergy]] sufferers and for its naturally sweeter taste. The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can be eaten whole (green almonds) when they are still green and fleshy on the outside and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, but is a popular snack in parts of the Middle East, eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. Also in the Middle East they are often eaten with dates. They are available only from mid-April to mid-June in the Northern Hemisphere; pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.\n\n[[Almond cookie]]s, Chinese [[almond biscuit]]s, and Italian ''[[ricciarelli]]'' are made with almonds.\n\n*In Greece, ground blanched almonds are used as the base material in a great variety of desserts, usually called ''amygdalota'' (\u03b1\u03bc\u03c5\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03ac). Because of their white color, most are traditionally considered wedding sweets and are served at wedding banquets. In addition, a soft drink known as ''[[soumada]]'' is made from almonds in various regions.\n*In [[Hejaz]], a region of [[Saudi Arabia]], ground almonds are used by adding them with cold milk to a hot coffee cup in addition to cinnamon powder and corn starch to make Almond Coffee ''Gahwat Al-l\u014dz'' (\u0642\u0647\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0648\u0632).\n*In Iran, green almonds are dipped in [[sea salt]] and eaten as snacks on street markets; they are called ''chaqale b\u00e2dam''. Also sweet almonds are used to prepare a special food for babies, named ''harire badam''. Almonds are added to some foods, cookies, and desserts, or are used to decorate foods. People in Iran consume roasted nuts for special events, for example, during New Year ([[Nowruz]]) parties.\n*In Italy, bitter almonds are the traditional base for ''[[Amaretti di Saronno|amaretti]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Amaretto Macaroon|title=Fine Italian Pastries & Biscotti|url=http://www.olivetreetrading.com/product-vicenzi.html|accessdate=10 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512173724/http://www.olivetreetrading.com/product-vicenzi.html|archivedate=12 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vicenzi Amaretto s'Italia (Macaroona)|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H7K5PQ|accessdate=10 April 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713181311/http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H7K5PQ|archivedate=13 July 2015}}</ref> (almond macaroons), a common dessert. Traditionally, a low percentage of bitter almonds (10\u201320%) is added to the ingredients, which gives the cookies their bitter taste (commercially, [[apricot kernel]]s are used as a substitute for bitter almonds). Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in ''[[torrone]]''. In [[Sicily]] ''pasta di mandorle'' (almond paste) is used to make small soft cakes, often decorated with jam, [[pistachio]], or chocolate. Also in Sicily, [[almond milk]] is a popular refreshing beverage in summer.\n*In Morocco, almonds in the form of sweet [[almond paste]] are the main ingredient in pastry fillings, and several other [[List of Moroccan dishes#Desserts|desserts]]. Fried blanched whole almonds are also used to decorate sweet ''[[tajine]]s'' such as lamb with prunes. A drink made from almonds mixed with milk is served in important ceremonies such as weddings and can also be ordered in some cafes. Southwestern Berber regions of [[Essaouira]] and Souss are also known for ''amlou'', a spread made of almond paste, [[argan oil]], and honey. Almond paste is also mixed with toasted flour and among others, honey, olive oil or butter, anise, fennel, sesame seeds, and cinnamon to make ''sellou'' (also called ''zamita'' in [[Meknes]] or ''slilou'' in [[Marrakech]]), a sweet snack known for its long shelf life and high nutritive value.\n*In [[Indian cuisine]], almonds are the base ingredients of ''[[pasanda]]''-style and [[Mughlai]] [[curry|curries]]. ''Badam halva'' is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as ''sohan barfi''), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface. Almonds form the base of various drinks which are supposed to have cooling properties. Almond sherbet or ''sherbet-e-badaam'', is a popular summer drink. Almonds are also sold as a snack with added salt.\n*In Israel almonds are topping [[tahini cookie]] or eaten as a snack.\n\nThe 'Marcona' almond cultivar is recognizably different from other almonds and is marketed by name.<ref name=Gradziel>{{cite book |author=Gradziel, T.M. |year=2011 |title=Horticultural Reviews, Volume 38 |chapter=Origin and Dissemination of Almonds |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |editor=J.

In [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 17 [[Levi]] is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by [[Aaron's rod]], which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The almond blossom supplied a model for the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] which stood in the [[Holy Temple]], \"Three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers\"  ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:33\u201334; 37:19\u201320).\n\nSimilarly, Christian symbolism often uses almond branches as a symbol of the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]]; paintings and [[icon]]s often include [[mandorla|almond-shaped haloes]] encircling the [[Christ Child]] and as a symbol of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]]. The word \"[[Luz]]\", which appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 30:37, sometimes translated as \"[[hazel]]\", may actually be derived from the Aramaic name for almond (Luz), and is translated as such in some Bible versions such as the [[NIV]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8YSB2K9d1oC&pg=PA37 |title=The meaning of trees: botany, history, healing, lore|author=Fred Hageneder |page=37|isbn=978-0-8118-4898-5|publisher=Chronicle Books|date=September 2005 }}</ref> The Arabic name for almond is \u0644\u0648\u0632 \"lauz\" or \"l\u016bz\".

At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms [[Oxygen cycle|produce oxygen]] and [[Biosequestration|sequester carbon]]. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land. The term ''marine'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''mare'', meaning sea or ocean.\n\nMost life forms evolved initially in [[marine habitats]].

Some of these evolved into [[amphibian]]s which spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Other fish evolved into land mammals and subsequently returned to the ocean as [[Pinniped|seals]], [[dolphin]]s or [[whale]]s. Plant forms such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] forms the general foundation of the ocean [[food chain]], particularly the [[#Phytoplankton|phytoplankton]] which are key [[primary producer]]s.\n\nMarine invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters, including breathing tubes as in [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]].

The idea of body plans originated with [[vertebrate]]s, which were grouped into one phylum. But the vertebrate body plan is only one of many, and invertebrates consist of many phyla or body plans. The history of the discovery of body plans can be seen as a movement from a worldview centred on vertebrates, to seeing the vertebrates as one body plan among many. Among the pioneering [[zoologist]]s, Linnaeus identified two body plans outside the vertebrates; Cuvier identified three; and Haeckel had four, as well as the Protista with eight more, for a total of twelve.

Retrieved 18 August 2016.</ref>). They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like [[mesohyl]] sandwiched between two thin layers of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s. They have unspecialized cells that can [[cellular differentiation|transform into other types]] and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have [[nervous system|nervous]], [[digestive system|digestive]] or [[circulatory system]]s. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes.\n\nSponges are similar to other animals in that they are [[multicellular]], [[heterotrophic]], lack [[cell wall]]s and produce [[sperm cell]]s. Unlike other animals, they lack true [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and have no [[body symmetry]]. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where it deposits nutrients, and leaves through a hole called the [[osculum]]. Many sponges have internal skeletons of [[spongin]] and/or spicules of [[calcium carbonate]] or [[silicon dioxide]]. All sponges are [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] aquatic animals. Although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt water) species, ranging from tidal zones to depths exceeding {{convert|8800|m|mi|abbr=on}}.

They are solitary worm-shaped organisms rarely seen by humans because of their lifestyle. They include two main groups, the [[acorn worms]] and the [[Pterobranchia]]. Pterobranchia form a class containing about 30 species of small worm-shaped animals that live in secreted tubes on the ocean floor. Acorn worms form a class containing about 111 species that generally live in U-shaped burrows on the seabed, from the shoreline to a depth of 3000 metres. The worms lie there with the proboscis sticking out of one opening in the burrow, subsisting as deposit feeders or suspension feeders. It is supposed the ancestors of acorn worms used to live in tubes like their relatives, the Pterobranchia, but eventually started to live a safer and more sheltered existence in sediment burrows.<ref>[https://phys.org/news/2016-07-secret-oesia-life-prehistoric-worm.html#nRlv The secret to an Oesia life: Prehistoric worm built tube-like 'houses' on sea floor]</ref> Some of these worms may grow to be very long; one particular species may reach a length of 2.5 metres (8&nbsp;ft 2 in), although most acorn worms are much smaller.\n\nAcorn worms are more highly specialised and advanced than other worm-like organisms. They have a circulatory system with a heart that also functions as a kidney. Acorn worms have gill-like structures they use for breathing, similar to the gills of fish. Therefore, acorn worms are sometimes said to be a link between classical invertebrates and [[vertebrate]]s. Acorn worms continually form new gill slits as they grow in size, and some older individuals have more than a hundred on each side. Each slit consists of a branchial chamber opening to the pharynx through a U-shaped cleft. Cilia push water through the slits, maintaining a constant flow, just as in fish.<ref name=Barnes1982>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 1018\u20131026|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}</ref> Some acorn worms also have a postanal tail which may be homologous to the post-anal tail of vertebrates.\n\nThe three-section body plan of the acorn worm is no longer present in the vertebrates, except in the anatomy of the frontal neural tube, later developed into a brain divided into three parts. This means some of the original anatomy of the early chordate ancestors is still present in vertebrates even if it is not always visible.

During the [[Mesozoic]] many groups of reptiles became adapted to life in the seas, including [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[nothosaur]]s, [[placodont]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, [[thalattosaur]]s and [[thalattosuchia]]ns. Marine reptiles were less numerous after [[mass extinction]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]].\n\n====Birds====\n{{Main|Seabird}}\n[[File:Chesapeake Waterbird Food Web.jpg|thumb|300px| {{center|Waterbird food web in [[Chesapeake Bay]]}}]]\n\n[[Seabirds|Marine birds]] are [[adaptation|adapted]] to life within the [[marine (ocean)|marine]] environment. They are often called ''seabirds''. While marine birds vary greatly in lifestyle, behaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking [[convergent evolution]], as the same environmental problems and feeding [[ecological niche|niches]] have resulted in similar adaptations. Examples include [[albatross]], [[penguin]]s, [[gannet]]s, and [[auk]]s.\n\nIn general, marine birds live longer, [[mating|breed]] later and have fewer young than terrestrial birds do, but they invest a great deal of time in their young. Most [[species]] nest in [[Bird colony|colonies]], which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for undertaking long annual [[bird migration|migrations]], crossing the [[equator]] or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Marine birds can be highly [[pelagic]], coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely. Some marine birds plummet from heights, plunging through the water leaving vapour-like trails, similar to that of fighter planes.<ref name=\"baitball\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeinthefastlane.ca/sardine-run-shark-feeding-frenzy-phenomenon-in-africa/miraculous-things |title=Sardine Run Shark Feeding Frenzy Phenomenon in Africa |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202092952/http://www.lifeinthefastlane.ca/sardine-run-shark-feeding-frenzy-phenomenon-in-africa/miraculous-things |archivedate=2 December 2008 }}</ref> [[Gannet]]s plunge into the water at up to 100 kilometres per hour (60&nbsp;mph).

Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as [[mating]], [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] and [[molting]]. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well: some may eat [[zooplankton]]; others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, and sea-grass; and a few may eat other mammals.\n\nIn a process of [[convergent evolution]], marine mammals, especially cetaceans redeveloped their [[body plan]] to parallel the streamlined [[wiktionary:fusiform|fusiform]] body plan of [[pelagic fish]]. Front legs became [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s and back legs disappeared, a [[dorsal fin]] reappeared and the tail morphed into a powerful horizontal [[Fluke (tail)|fluke]].

In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, are often [[K-strategists]] that grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nBecause of this inversion, it is the zooplankton that make up most of the marine animal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. As [[primary consumer]]s, they  are the crucial link between the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) and the rest of the marine food web ([[secondary consumer]]s).<ref>U S Department of Energy (2008) [https://public.ornl.gov/site/gallery/detail.cfm?id=326 ''Carbon Cycling and Biosequestration''] page 81, Workshop report DOE/SC-108, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.</ref>\n\nIf phytoplankton dies before it is eaten, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] as part of the [[marine snow]] and settles into the depths of sea.

Coastlines typically have [[continental shelves]] extending some way from the shore. These provide extensive shallows sunlit down to the seafloor, allowing for photosynthesis and enabling habitats for seagrass meadows, coral reefs, kelp forests and other [[Benthos|benthic life]]. Further from shore the continental shelf slopes towards deep water. Wind [[Ekman transport|blowing at the ocean surface]] or [[deep ocean current]]s can result in cold and nutrient rich waters from [[abyssal depth]]s moving up the [[continental slope]]s. This can result in [[upwelling]]s along the outer edges of continental shelves, providing conditions for  [[phytoplankton bloom]]s.\n\nWater evaporated by the sun from the surface of the ocean can precipitate on land and eventually return to the ocean as [[Surface runoff|runoff]] or discharge from rivers, enriched with nutrients as well as [[Marine pollution|pollutants]]. As rivers discharge into [[estuaries]], [[freshwater]] mixes with [[saltwater]] and becomes [[brackish]]. This provides another shallow water habitat where [[mangrove forest]]s and [[estuarine fish]] thrive. Overall, life in inland lakes can evolve with greater diversity than happens in the sea, because freshwater habitats are themselves diverse and compartmentalised in a way marine habitats are not. Some aquatic life, such as [[salmon]] and [[eel]]s, [[Fish migration|migrate]] back and forth between freshwater and marine habitats. These migrations can result in exchanges of pathogens and have impacts on the way life evolves in the ocean.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Anthropogenic impacts==\n[[File:Global cumulative human impact on the ocean.png|thumb|400px| {{center|Global cumulative human impact on the ocean <ref name=Halpern2019>{{cite journal | last1 = Halpern | first1 = B.S. | last2 = Frazier | first2 = M. | last3 = Afflerbach | first3 = J. | display-authors = etal | year = 2019 | title = Recent pace of change in human impact on the world's ocean | url = | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 1| page = 11609 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-019-47201-9 | pmid = 31406130 | pmc = 6691109 | bibcode = 2019NatSR...911609H }}</ref>}}]]\n{{main|Human impact on marine life}}\n\nHuman activities affect marine life and [[marine habitat]]s through [[overfishing]], [[Marine pollution|pollution]], [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] and the introduction of [[invasive species]].

In biology many phyla, families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land. Marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy. For this reason marine biology encompasses not only organisms that live only in a marine environment, but also other organisms whose lives revolve around the sea. Biological oceanography is the study of how organisms affect and are affected by the [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[geology]] of the [[ocean|oceanographic system]]. Biological oceanography mostly focuses on the [[microorganism]]s within the ocean; looking at how they are affected by their environment and how that affects larger marine creatures and their ecosystem.<ref name =\"Lalli Parsons\">Lalli, Carol M., and Timothy R.

At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms [[Oxygen cycle|produce oxygen]] and [[Biosequestration|sequester carbon]]. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land. The term ''marine'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''mare'', meaning sea or ocean.\n\nMost life forms evolved initially in [[marine habitats]]. By volume, oceans provide about 90 percent of the living space on the planet.<ref name=\"NOAA2019\" /> The earliest [[vertebrate]]s appeared in the form of [[fish]],<ref>[https://www.livescience.com/46262-fossil-ancestor-jawed-vertebrates.html Tiny Fish May Be Ancestor of Nearly All Living Vertebrates] ''Live Science'', 11 June 2014.</ref> which live exclusively in water. Some of these evolved into [[amphibian]]s which spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Other fish evolved into land mammals and subsequently returned to the ocean as [[Pinniped|seals]], [[dolphin]]s or [[whale]]s. Plant forms such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] forms the general foundation of the ocean [[food chain]], particularly the [[#Phytoplankton|phytoplankton]] which are key [[primary producer]]s.\n\nMarine invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters, including breathing tubes as in [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]. Fish have [[Fish gill|gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air.\n\nThere are over 200,000 documented marine [[species]] with perhaps two million marine species yet to be documented.<ref name=\"la.2009\">{{cite news |title=Mapping an ocean of species |last=Drogin |first=Bob |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/02/nation/na-fish2 |date=2 August 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2009 |work=Los Angeles Times }}</ref> Marine species range in size from the microscopic, including [[phytoplankton]] which can be as small as 0.02 micrometres, to huge [[cetacean]]s (whales, dolphins and porpoises), including the [[blue whale]] &ndash; the largest known animal reaching {{convert|33|m|ft}} in length.<ref>{{cite book |last=Paul |first1=Gregory S. |title=The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs |chapter=The Evolution of Dinosaurs and their World |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2010 |page=19}}</ref><ref name=Bortolotti>{{cite book | last = Bortolotti | first  = Dan | title  = Wild Blue: A Natural History of the World's Largest Animal | year = 2008 | publisher  = St. Martin's Press}}</ref> [[Marine microorganism]]s, including [[protist]]s, [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es, constitute about 70% of the total marine [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].\n\n==Water==\n[[File:Earth elevation histogram 2.svg|thumb|right|300px|{{center|Elevation histogram showing the percentage of the Earth's surface above and below sea level}}]]\n{{See also|Hydrosphere}}\n\nThere is no life without water.<ref>Xiao-feng, Pang  (2014) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=O_26CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Water:+Molecular+Structure+And+Properties%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYiYX-x97iAhUYfH0KHQHTCAkQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=%22Water%3A%20Molecular%20Structure%20And%20Properties%22&f=false ''Water: Molecular Structure And Properties''], chapter 5, pp. 390\u2013461, World Scientific. {{ISBN|9789814440448}}</ref> It has been described as the ''universal solvent'' for its ability to [[Solvent|dissolve]] many substances,<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|page=620}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Water, the Universal Solvent |url=http://water.usgs.gov/edu/solvent.html |website=[[USGS]] |access-date=27 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709141251/https://water.usgs.gov/edu/solvent.html |archive-date=9 July 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and as the ''solvent of life''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Campbell Biology |last=Reece |first=Jane B. |date=31 October 2013 |publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]] |isbn=9780321775658 |edition=10 |location=|publication-date= |page=48 |via= }}</ref> Water is the only common substance to exist as a [[ice|solid]], liquid, and [[water vapor|gas]] under conditions normal to life on Earth.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Campbell Biology |last=Reece |first=Jane B. |date=31 October 2013 |publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]] |isbn=9780321775658 |edition=10 |location=|publication-date= |page=44 |via= }}</ref> The [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi]] referred to water as the ''mater und matrix'': the mother and womb of life.<ref>Collins J.

The history of the discovery of body plans can be seen as a movement from a worldview centred on vertebrates, to seeing the vertebrates as one body plan among many. Among the pioneering [[zoologist]]s, Linnaeus identified two body plans outside the vertebrates; Cuvier identified three; and Haeckel had four, as well as the Protista with eight more, for a total of twelve.

They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like [[mesohyl]] sandwiched between two thin layers of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s. They have unspecialized cells that can [[cellular differentiation|transform into other types]] and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have [[nervous system|nervous]], [[digestive system|digestive]] or [[circulatory system]]s. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes.\n\nSponges are similar to other animals in that they are [[multicellular]], [[heterotrophic]], lack [[cell wall]]s and produce [[sperm cell]]s. Unlike other animals, they lack true [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and have no [[body symmetry]]. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where it deposits nutrients, and leaves through a hole called the [[osculum]]. Many sponges have internal skeletons of [[spongin]] and/or spicules of [[calcium carbonate]] or [[silicon dioxide]]. All sponges are [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] aquatic animals. Although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt water) species, ranging from tidal zones to depths exceeding {{convert|8800|m|mi|abbr=on}}.

This generalized mollusc is unsegmented and [[bilaterally symmetrical]] with an underside consisting of a single muscular [[Foot (mollusc)|foot]]. Beyond that it has three further key features. Firstly, it has a muscular cloak called a [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] covering its viscera and containing a significant cavity used for breathing and [[excretion]]. A [[gastropod shell|shell]] secreted by the mantle covers the upper surface. Secondly (apart from bivalves) it has a rasping tongue called a [[radula]] used for feeding.

They are solitary worm-shaped organisms rarely seen by humans because of their lifestyle. They include two main groups, the [[acorn worms]] and the [[Pterobranchia]]. Pterobranchia form a class containing about 30 species of small worm-shaped animals that live in secreted tubes on the ocean floor. Acorn worms form a class containing about 111 species that generally live in U-shaped burrows on the seabed, from the shoreline to a depth of 3000 metres. The worms lie there with the proboscis sticking out of one opening in the burrow, subsisting as deposit feeders or suspension feeders. It is supposed the ancestors of acorn worms used to live in tubes like their relatives, the Pterobranchia, but eventually started to live a safer and more sheltered existence in sediment burrows.<ref>[https://phys.org/news/2016-07-secret-oesia-life-prehistoric-worm.html#nRlv The secret to an Oesia life: Prehistoric worm built tube-like 'houses' on sea floor]</ref> Some of these worms may grow to be very long; one particular species may reach a length of 2.5 metres (8&nbsp;ft 2 in), although most acorn worms are much smaller.\n\nAcorn worms are more highly specialised and advanced than other worm-like organisms. They have a circulatory system with a heart that also functions as a kidney. Acorn worms have gill-like structures they use for breathing, similar to the gills of fish. Therefore, acorn worms are sometimes said to be a link between classical invertebrates and [[vertebrate]]s. Acorn worms continually form new gill slits as they grow in size, and some older individuals have more than a hundred on each side. Each slit consists of a branchial chamber opening to the pharynx through a U-shaped cleft. Cilia push water through the slits, maintaining a constant flow, just as in fish.<ref name=Barnes1982>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 1018\u20131026|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}</ref> Some acorn worms also have a postanal tail which may be homologous to the post-anal tail of vertebrates.\n\nThe three-section body plan of the acorn worm is no longer present in the vertebrates, except in the anatomy of the frontal neural tube, later developed into a brain divided into three parts. This means some of the original anatomy of the early chordate ancestors is still present in vertebrates even if it is not always visible.

Examples include [[albatross]], [[penguin]]s, [[gannet]]s, and [[auk]]s.\n\nIn general, marine birds live longer, [[mating|breed]] later and have fewer young than terrestrial birds do, but they invest a great deal of time in their young. Most [[species]] nest in [[Bird colony|colonies]], which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for undertaking long annual [[bird migration|migrations]], crossing the [[equator]] or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Marine birds can be highly [[pelagic]], coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny phytoplankton which tend to be [[r-strategists]] that grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, are often [[K-strategists]] that grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nBecause of this inversion, it is the zooplankton that make up most of the marine animal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. As [[primary consumer]]s, they  are the crucial link between the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) and the rest of the marine food web ([[secondary consumer]]s).<ref>U S Department of Energy (2008) [https://public.ornl.gov/site/gallery/detail.cfm?id=326 ''Carbon Cycling and Biosequestration''] page 81, Workshop report DOE/SC-108, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.</ref>\n\nIf phytoplankton dies before it is eaten, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] as part of the [[marine snow]] and settles into the depths of sea.

Coastlines typically have [[continental shelves]] extending some way from the shore. These provide extensive shallows sunlit down to the seafloor, allowing for photosynthesis and enabling habitats for seagrass meadows, coral reefs, kelp forests and other [[Benthos|benthic life]]. Further from shore the continental shelf slopes towards deep water. Wind [[Ekman transport|blowing at the ocean surface]] or [[deep ocean current]]s can result in cold and nutrient rich waters from [[abyssal depth]]s moving up the [[continental slope]]s. This can result in [[upwelling]]s along the outer edges of continental shelves, providing conditions for  [[phytoplankton bloom]]s.\n\nWater evaporated by the sun from the surface of the ocean can precipitate on land and eventually return to the ocean as [[Surface runoff|runoff]] or discharge from rivers, enriched with nutrients as well as [[Marine pollution|pollutants]]. As rivers discharge into [[estuaries]], [[freshwater]] mixes with [[saltwater]] and becomes [[brackish]]. This provides another shallow water habitat where [[mangrove forest]]s and [[estuarine fish]] thrive. Overall, life in inland lakes can evolve with greater diversity than happens in the sea, because freshwater habitats are themselves diverse and compartmentalised in a way marine habitats are not. Some aquatic life, such as [[salmon]] and [[eel]]s, [[Fish migration|migrate]] back and forth between freshwater and marine habitats. These migrations can result in exchanges of pathogens and have impacts on the way life evolves in the ocean.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Anthropogenic impacts==\n[[File:Global cumulative human impact on the ocean.png|thumb|400px| {{center|Global cumulative human impact on the ocean <ref name=Halpern2019>{{cite journal | last1 = Halpern | first1 = B.S. | last2 = Frazier | first2 = M. | last3 = Afflerbach | first3 = J. | display-authors = etal | year = 2019 | title = Recent pace of change in human impact on the world's ocean | url = | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 1| page = 11609 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-019-47201-9 | pmid = 31406130 | pmc = 6691109 | bibcode = 2019NatSR...911609H }}</ref>}}]]\n{{main|Human impact on marine life}}\n\nHuman activities affect marine life and [[marine habitat]]s through [[overfishing]], [[Marine pollution|pollution]], [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] and the introduction of [[invasive species]].

In biology many phyla, families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land. Marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy. For this reason marine biology encompasses not only organisms that live only in a marine environment, but also other organisms whose lives revolve around the sea. Biological oceanography is the study of how organisms affect and are affected by the [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[geology]] of the [[ocean|oceanographic system]]. Biological oceanography mostly focuses on the [[microorganism]]s within the ocean; looking at how they are affected by their environment and how that affects larger marine creatures and their ecosystem.<ref name =\"Lalli Parsons\">Lalli, Carol M., and Timothy R.

Biological oceanography takes a bottom up approach in terms of the food web, while marine biology studies the ocean from a top down perspective. Biological oceanography mainly focuses on the ecosystem of the ocean with an emphasis on plankton: their diversity (morphology, nutritional sources, motility, and metabolism); their productivity and how that plays a role in the global carbon cycle; and their distribution (predation and life cycle).<ref name=\"Lalli Parsons\" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Menden-Deuer |first=Susanne |title=Course Info, OCG 561 Biological Oceanography |url=http://www.gso.uri.edu/ocg561/}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Charles B. |author2=Patricia A.

Founded in 1943, it became part of the [[United Nations]] in 1945, and it largely shut down operations in 1947. Its purpose was to \"plan, co-ordinate, administer or arrange for the administration of measures for the relief of victims of war in any area under the control of any of the United Nations through the provision of food, fuel, clothing, shelter and other basic necessities, medical and other essential services\".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1943/431109a.html |title = Agreement for United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration |publisher=Ibiblio.org}}</ref>\nIts staff of civil servants included 12,000 people, with headquarters in New York.  Funding came from many nations, and totaled $3.7 billion, of which the United States contributed $2.7 billion; Britain, $625 million; and Canada, $139 million.\n\nUNRRA cooperated closely with dozens of volunteer charitable organizations, who sent hundreds of their own agencies to work alongside UNRRA. In operation only four years, the agency distributed about $4 billion worth of goods, food, medicine, tools, and farm implements at a time of severe global shortages and worldwide transportation difficulties. The recipient nations had been especially hard hit by starvation, dislocation, and political chaos. It  played a major role in helping [[Displaced Persons]] return to their home countries in Europe in 1945-46.

In 2016, the scrypt algorithm was published by [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] as RFC 7914. A simplified version of scrypt is used as a [[proof-of-work]] scheme by a number of [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]], first implemented by an anonymous programmer called ArtForz in Tenebrix and followed by Fairbrix and [[Litecoin]] soon after.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/4x3ywn/beyond-bitcoin-a-guide-to-the-most-promising-cryptocurrencies|title=Beyond Bitcoin: A Guide to the Most Promising Cryptocurrencies|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|author=Alec Liu}}</ref>\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nA password-based [[key derivation function]] (password-based KDF) is generally designed to be computationally intensive, so that it takes a relatively long time to compute (say on the order of several hundred milliseconds). Legitimate users only need to perform the function once per operation (e.g., authentication), and so the time required is negligible. However, a brute-force attack would likely need to perform the operation billions of times, at which point the time requirements become significant and, ideally, prohibitive.\n\nPrevious password-based KDFs (such as the popular [[PBKDF2]] from [[RSA Laboratories]]) have relatively low resource demands, meaning they do not require elaborate hardware or very much memory to perform. They are therefore easily and cheaply implemented in hardware (for instance on an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] or even an [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]]). This allows an attacker with sufficient resources to launch a large-scale parallel attack by building hundreds or even thousands of implementations of the algorithm in hardware and having each search a different subset of the key space. This divides the amount of time needed to complete a brute-force attack by the number of implementations available, very possibly bringing it down to a reasonable time frame.\n\nThe scrypt function is designed to hinder such attempts by raising the resource demands of the algorithm.

Once the vector is generated, the elements of it are accessed in a pseudo-random order and combined to produce the derived key. A straightforward implementation would need to keep the entire vector in RAM so that it can be accessed as needed.\n\nBecause the elements of the vector are generated algorithmically, each element could be generated ''on the fly'' as needed, only storing one element in memory at a time and therefore cutting the memory requirements significantly. However, the generation of each element is intended to be computationally expensive, and the elements are expected to be accessed many times throughout the execution of the function. Thus there is a significant trade-off in speed in order to get rid of the large memory requirements.\n\nThis sort of [[Space\u2013time tradeoff|time\u2013memory trade-off]] often exists in computer algorithms: speed can be increased at the cost of using more memory, or memory requirements decreased at the cost of performing more operations and taking longer. The idea behind scrypt is to deliberately make this trade-off costly in either direction. Thus an attacker could use an implementation that doesn't require many resources (and can therefore be massively parallelized with limited expense) but runs very slowly, or use an implementation that runs more quickly but has very large memory requirements and is therefore more expensive to parallelize.\n\n== Algorithm ==\n\nThe algorithm includes the following parameters:\n\n* Passphrase - The string of characters to be hashed.\n* [[Salt (cryptography)|Salt]] - A string of characters that modifies the hash to protect against [[Rainbow table]] attacks\n* N - CPU/memory cost parameter.\n* p - Parallelization parameter; a positive integer satisfying p \u2264 (2<sup>32</sup>\u2212 1) * hLen / MFLen.\n* dkLen - Intended output length in octets of the derived key; a positive integer satisfying dkLen \u2264 (2<sup>32</sup>\u2212 1) * hLen.\n* r - The blocksize parameter, which fine-tunes sequential memory read size and performance. 8 is commonly used.\n* hLen - The length in octets of the hash function (32 for SHA256).\n* MFlen - The length in octets of the output of the mixing function (''SMix'' below).

Legitimate users only need to perform the function once per operation (e.g., authentication), and so the time required is negligible. However, a brute-force attack would likely need to perform the operation billions of times, at which point the time requirements become significant and, ideally, prohibitive.\n\nPrevious password-based KDFs (such as the popular [[PBKDF2]] from [[RSA Laboratories]]) have relatively low resource demands, meaning they do not require elaborate hardware or very much memory to perform. They are therefore easily and cheaply implemented in hardware (for instance on an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] or even an [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]]). This allows an attacker with sufficient resources to launch a large-scale parallel attack by building hundreds or even thousands of implementations of the algorithm in hardware and having each search a different subset of the key space. This divides the amount of time needed to complete a brute-force attack by the number of implementations available, very possibly bringing it down to a reasonable time frame.\n\nThe scrypt function is designed to hinder such attempts by raising the resource demands of the algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm is designed to use a large amount of memory compared to other password-based KDFs,<ref>[http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf Stronger Key Derivation Via Sequential Memory-Hard Functions], \nColin Percival</ref> \nmaking the size and the cost of a hardware implementation much more expensive, and therefore limiting the amount of parallelism an attacker can use, for a given amount of financial resources.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe large memory requirements of scrypt come from a large vector of [[pseudorandom]] bit strings that are generated as part of the algorithm. Once the vector is generated, the elements of it are accessed in a pseudo-random order and combined to produce the derived key. A straightforward implementation would need to keep the entire vector in RAM so that it can be accessed as needed.\n\nBecause the elements of the vector are generated algorithmically, each element could be generated ''on the fly'' as needed, only storing one element in memory at a time and therefore cutting the memory requirements significantly. However, the generation of each element is intended to be computationally expensive, and the elements are expected to be accessed many times throughout the execution of the function. Thus there is a significant trade-off in speed in order to get rid of the large memory requirements.\n\nThis sort of [[Space\u2013time tradeoff|time\u2013memory trade-off]] often exists in computer algorithms: speed can be increased at the cost of using more memory, or memory requirements decreased at the cost of performing more operations and taking longer. The idea behind scrypt is to deliberately make this trade-off costly in either direction.

When a wiretap reveals that the couple intended, first, to have the employer held criminally responsible for the baby's murder and, second, to sue the employer for wrongful death. Initially, the primary issue appears to be the fetus age at which a murder charge can be leveled. The primary issue proves to be two-fold; 1. whether the suspects can be held accountable for knowing both the law and its meaning, and 2. even if the suspects cannot legally be convicted of the baby's murder, whether they can be convicted of a lesser crime, i.e. attempted murder.\n |LineColor=fa9d6e\n}}{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|Law & Order (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber=29\n |EpisodeNumber2=7\n |Title=In Memory Of\n |DirectedBy=Ed Sherin\n |WrittenBy={{StoryTeleplay\n | s = Siobhan Byrne;\n | t = Robert Stuart Nathan;\n | ex1 = David Black\n | slabel = {{abbr|S|Story by}}\n | tlabel = {{abbr|T|Teleplay by}}\n | ex1label = {{abbr|S/T|Story and teleplay by}}\n }}\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1991|11|5}}\n |ProdCode=67413\n |Aux4=18.10{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n |ShortSummary=The renovation of a brownstone uncovers the remains of a young boy who disappeared thirty-one years earlier during the 1960 presidential campaign.

The primary issue proves to be two-fold; 1. whether the suspects can be held accountable for knowing both the law and its meaning, and 2. even if the suspects cannot legally be convicted of the baby's murder, whether they can be convicted of a lesser crime, i.e. attempted murder.\n |LineColor=fa9d6e\n}}{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|Law & Order (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber=29\n |EpisodeNumber2=7\n |Title=In Memory Of\n |DirectedBy=Ed Sherin\n |WrittenBy={{StoryTeleplay\n | s = Siobhan Byrne;\n | t = Robert Stuart Nathan;\n | ex1 = David Black\n | slabel = {{abbr|S|Story by}}\n | tlabel = {{abbr|T|Teleplay by}}\n | ex1label = {{abbr|S/T|Story and teleplay by}}\n }}\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1991|11|5}}\n |ProdCode=67413\n |Aux4=18.10{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n |ShortSummary=The renovation of a brownstone uncovers the remains of a young boy who disappeared thirty-one years earlier during the 1960 presidential campaign.

The reference suggests that the rhyme, and particularly the chorus, was well enough known in the early nineteenth century for the joke to be understood.<ref>Sir Walter Scott, [http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/gutenberg/etext04/ant3w10.txt ''The Antiquary'' (1816)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908102129/http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/gutenberg/etext04/ant3w10.txt |date=2006-09-08 }}, accessed 25/04/09.</ref>\n\n==The Brownie of Blednoch==\n\nAiken Drum is also the name given by the Scottish poet [[William Nicholson (poet)|William Nicholson]] to the [[brownie (folklore)|brownie]] in his poem \"The Brownie of [[Bladnoch, Wigtownshire|Blednoch]]\" (1825). Although this has led some folklorists to speculate that the song may derive from older [[fairy]] legends, there is no evidence of the name being used for a brownie prior to Nicholson.<ref name=Briggs>Briggs, Katharine (1976).
