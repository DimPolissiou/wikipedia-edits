The 9-1-1 Communications Dispatch Center handles all 9-1-1 calls for service within the county and city, including fire and EMS. The [[Savannah (Georgia) Fire Department|Savannah Fire Department]] only serves the City of Savannah and remains separate from the other municipal firefighting organizations in Chatham County.\n\nWhile some{{Who|date=January 2014}} see the police merger as a step toward city-county [[Consolidated city-county|consolidation]], Savannah is actually one of eight incorporated cities or towns in Chatham County. (The others are [[Bloomingdale, Georgia|Bloomingdale]], [[Garden City, Georgia|Garden City]], [[Pooler, Georgia|Pooler]], [[Port Wentworth, Georgia|Port Wentworth]], [[Thunderbolt, Georgia|Thunderbolt]], [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Tybee Island]] and [[Vernonburg, Georgia|Vernonburg]]). Although these seven smaller localities would remain independent from a consolidated government, they have long opposed any efforts to adopt a city-county merger. One fear is that consolidation would reduce county funding to areas outside of Savannah.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn February 2018, the city and county governments ended the police department merger.

In the early years of the United States, goods produced in the [[New World]] had to pass through Atlantic ports such as Savannah's before they could be shipped to England.\n\nBetween 1912 and 1968, the [[Savannah Machine & Foundry]] Company was a shipbuilder in Savannah.<ref name=Bloome>{{cite book|last1=Bloome|first1=Kenneth J.|title=Historical Dictionary of the U.S. Maritime Industry|date=2012|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|location=[[Plymouth]]|page=429|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r_jTIbdFUnYC&lpg=PA429&dq=%22Savannah%20Machine%20%26%20Foundry%22%20-wikipedia&pg=PA429#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=26 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904090305/https://books.google.com/books?id=r_jTIbdFUnYC&lpg=PA429&ots=iLU9Rx5uJR&dq=%22Savannah%20Machine%20%26%20Foundry%22%20-wikipedia&pg=PA429#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=September 4, 2015|url-status=live|isbn=9780810856349}}</ref>\n\nThe Port of Savannah, manufacturing, the military, and [[tourism]] have become Savannah's four major economic drivers in the twenty-first century.  In 2006, the Savannah Area Convention & Visitors Bureau reported over 6.85 million visitors to the city during the year. By 2011, the Bureau reported that the number of visitors the city attracted increased to 12.1 million. Lodging, dining, entertainment, and visitor-related transportation account for over $2 billion in visitors' spending per year and employ over 17,000.\n\nFor years, Savannah was the home of [[Union Camp]], which housed the world's largest paper mill. The plant is now owned by [[International Paper]], and it remains one of Savannah's largest employers. Savannah is also home to the [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] company, maker of private jets, as well as various other large industrial interests. [[TitleMax]] is headquartered in Savannah. [[Morris Multimedia]], a newspaper and television company, is also based in Savannah.\n\nIn 2000, [[J. C.

Georgia's [[Ogeechee River]] flows toward the Atlantic Ocean some {{convert|16|mi|km}} south of downtown Savannah, and forms the southern city limit.\n\nSavannah is prone to flooding, due to abundant rainfall, an elevation at just above sea level, and the shape of the coastline, which poses a greater surge risk during hurricanes. The city currently uses five canals.

In the Deep South, this is characterized by long and almost tropical summers and short, mild winters. Savannah records few days of freezing temperatures each year (and has rare snowfall). Due to its proximity to the Atlantic coast, Savannah rarely experiences temperatures as extreme as those in Georgia's interior. Nevertheless, the extreme temperatures have officially ranged from {{convert|105|\u00b0F|0}}, on July 20, 1986, down to {{convert|3|\u00b0F|0}} during the [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak]].<ref name= TWC >{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0506?from=36hr_bottomnav_undeclared|title=Average Weather for Savannah, GA \u2013 Temperature and Precipitation|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=December 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424025443/http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0506?from=36hr_bottomnav_undeclared|archive-date=April 24, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSeasonally, Savannah tends to have hot and humid summers with frequent (but brief) thunderstorms that develop in the warm and tropical air masses, which are common. Although summers in Savannah are frequently sunny, half of Savannah's annual precipitation falls during the months of June through September. Average dewpoints in summer range from {{convert|67.8|to|71.6|F|0}}. Winters in Savannah are mild and sunny with average daily high temperatures close to {{convert|60|\u00b0F|0}}. November and December are the driest months recorded at Savannah\u2013Hilton Head International Airport. Each year,  Savannah reports 24 days on average with low temperatures below freezing, though in some years fewer than 10 nights will fall below freezing. Although decades might pass between snowfall events, Savannah has experienced snow on rare occasions, most notably in December 1989, when up to 3.9 inches were recorded in one day in parts of the city.<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=chs\n|title = NowData \u2013 NOAA Online Weather Data\n|publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n|accessdate = 2012-02-27\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120921011517/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=chs\n|archive-date = September 21, 2012\n|url-status = live\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|publisher=|access-date=July 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712002910/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMweb/|archive-date=July 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSavannah is at risk for [[hurricanes]], particularly of the [[Cape Verde hurricane|Cape Verde]] type of storms that take place during the peak of the season. Because of its location in the Georgia [[Bight (geography)|Bight]] (the arc of the Atlantic coastline in Georgia and northern Florida) as well as the tendency for hurricanes to re-curve up the coast, Savannah has a lower risk of hurricanes than some other coastal cities such as [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

The [[Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department]] was established on January 1, 2005, after the Savannah Police Department and Chatham County Police Department merged. The department has a number of specialty units, including: K-9, SWAT, Bomb Squad, Marine Patrol, Dive, Air Support and Mounted Patrol. The 9-1-1 Communications Dispatch Center handles all 9-1-1 calls for service within the county and city, including fire and EMS. The [[Savannah (Georgia) Fire Department|Savannah Fire Department]] only serves the City of Savannah and remains separate from the other municipal firefighting organizations in Chatham County.\n\nWhile some{{Who|date=January 2014}} see the police merger as a step toward city-county [[Consolidated city-county|consolidation]], Savannah is actually one of eight incorporated cities or towns in Chatham County. (The others are [[Bloomingdale, Georgia|Bloomingdale]], [[Garden City, Georgia|Garden City]], [[Pooler, Georgia|Pooler]], [[Port Wentworth, Georgia|Port Wentworth]], [[Thunderbolt, Georgia|Thunderbolt]], [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Tybee Island]] and [[Vernonburg, Georgia|Vernonburg]]). Although these seven smaller localities would remain independent from a consolidated government, they have long opposed any efforts to adopt a city-county merger. One fear is that consolidation would reduce county funding to areas outside of Savannah.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn February 2018, the city and county governments ended the police department merger.

Savannah's port has always been a mainstay of the city's economy. In the early years of the United States, goods produced in the [[New World]] had to pass through Atlantic ports such as Savannah's before they could be shipped to England.\n\nBetween 1912 and 1968, the [[Savannah Machine & Foundry]] Company was a shipbuilder in Savannah.<ref name=Bloome>{{cite book|last1=Bloome|first1=Kenneth J.|title=Historical Dictionary of the U.S. Maritime Industry|date=2012|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|location=[[Plymouth]]|page=429|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r_jTIbdFUnYC&lpg=PA429&dq=%22Savannah%20Machine%20%26%20Foundry%22%20-wikipedia&pg=PA429#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=26 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904090305/https://books.google.com/books?id=r_jTIbdFUnYC&lpg=PA429&ots=iLU9Rx5uJR&dq=%22Savannah%20Machine%20%26%20Foundry%22%20-wikipedia&pg=PA429#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=September 4, 2015|url-status=live|isbn=9780810856349}}</ref>\n\nThe Port of Savannah, manufacturing, the military, and [[tourism]] have become Savannah's four major economic drivers in the twenty-first century.  In 2006, the Savannah Area Convention & Visitors Bureau reported over 6.85 million visitors to the city during the year. By 2011, the Bureau reported that the number of visitors the city attracted increased to 12.1 million. Lodging, dining, entertainment, and visitor-related transportation account for over $2 billion in visitors' spending per year and employ over 17,000.\n\nFor years, Savannah was the home of [[Union Camp]], which housed the world's largest paper mill. The plant is now owned by [[International Paper]], and it remains one of Savannah's largest employers. Savannah is also home to the [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] company, maker of private jets, as well as various other large industrial interests. [[TitleMax]] is headquartered in Savannah. [[Morris Multimedia]], a newspaper and television company, is also based in Savannah.\n\nIn 2000, [[J. C.

He is particularly remembered for his works the ''Proverbiorum libellus'' (1498), a collection of Latin proverbs; ''De inventoribus rerum'' (1499), a history of discoveries and origins; and the ''Anglica Historia'' (drafted by 1513; printed 1534), an influential history of England. He has been dubbed the \"Father of [[History of England|English History]]\".<ref>Galdieri 1993, pp. 316\u201317. This sobriquet has also been assigned to other historians, notably the Venerable [[Bede]].</ref>\n\nVergil is sometimes referred to in contemporary documents as '''Polydore Vergil Castellensis''' or '''Castellen''', leading some to assume that he was a kinsman of his patron, Cardinal [[Adriano Castellesi]]. However, it is more likely that the alias simply indicates that he was in Castellesi's service.<ref>Hay 1952, p. 3.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Urbino, targe virgilio vecchietti e polidoro virgili e balcone.JPG|thumb|right|Vergil's family home and alleged birthplace in [[Urbino]], marked with a plaque (the lower of the two)]]\n===Early life in Italy===\nVergil was born at [[Urbino]], or more probably at [[Fermignano]], within the [[Duchy of Urbino]].<ref name=ODNB>Connell 2004.</ref> His father, Giorgio di Antonio, owned a dispensary. His grandfather, Antonio Virgili, \"a man well skilled in medicine and astrology\",<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Virgil, Polydore |volume=28 |pages=116\u2013117}}</ref> had taught philosophy at the [[University of Paris]]; as did Polydore's own brother, Giovanni-Matteo Virgili,<ref name=EB1911/> at [[Ferrara]] and [[Padua]]. Another brother, Girolamo, was a merchant trading with England.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 1, 15\u201316.</ref> The niece of Polydore Vergil, Faustina, married Lorenzo Borgogelli, count of [[Fano]], from whom descend the family of Borgogelli Virgili.\n\nPolydore was educated at the [[University of Padua]], and possibly at [[Bologna]]. He was ordained by 1496.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 1\u20132.</ref> He was probably in the service of [[Guidobaldo da Montefeltro]], [[Duke of Urbino]], before 1498, as in the dedication of his ''Proverbiorum Libellus'' (April 1498) he styles himself Guido's client.<ref name=EB1911/> His second book, ''De Inventoribus Rerum'', was dedicated to Guido's tutor, Lodovico Odassio, in August 1499.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nAt some point prior to 1502 Polydore entered the service of [[Pope Alexander VI]].\n\n===Move to England===\n[[File:The Music School, Cathedral Green - Wells - geograph.org.uk - 985810.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Old Archdeaconry\" in Wells, traditionally identified as Vergil's residence there. Now the Music School of [[Wells Cathedral School]]]]\nIn 1502, Vergil travelled to England as the deputy of Cardinal [[Adriano Castellesi]] in the office of Collector of [[Peter's Pence]], and, in practice, the Cardinal's agent in a variety of affairs. In October 1504 he was enthroned [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] as proxy for Adriano;<ref name=EB1911/> and in 1508 he himself was installed as [[List of Archdeacons of Wells|Archdeacon of Wells]]. He probably spent little time in Wells, but was active as the Chapter's representative in London.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 8\u20139, 19\u201320.</ref> He also donated a set of hangings for the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]] of [[Wells Cathedral]].<ref>Harris 2005.</ref> He held other ecclesiastical [[sinecure]]s, including, from 1503, the living of [[East Langton|Church Langton]], Leicestershire; from 1508 [[Prebendary|prebends]] in [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and [[Hereford Cathedral]]s; and from 1513 the prebend of Oxgate in [[St Paul's Cathedral]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAs an established author, and a representative of Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] learning, Vergil was received in England as a minor celebrity, and was welcomed at court by King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]].<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> It was at the King's behest that he began work on his ''Anglica Historia'', a new history of England, probably as early as 1505.\n\nOn 22 October 1510, he was [[Naturalization|naturalised]] English.\n\nEarly in 1515 \u2013 through the intrigues of [[Andrea Ammonio]], who sought the subcollectorship for himself \u2013 an ill-judged letter from Vergil was intercepted by the authorities. It contained what was read as implied criticism of both [[Thomas Wolsey]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and as a result Vergil was imprisoned in April in the [[Tower of London]]. His supporters and advocates included [[Pope Leo X]], who wrote to the King on his behalf.<ref name=EB1911/> From prison Vergil wrote to Wolsey, begging that the approaching Christmas season \u2013 a time which witnessed the restitution of a world \u2013 might also see his pardon: his letter's tone has been described as \"almost blasphemous\".<ref name=EB1911/> He was released before Christmas 1515, but never regained his subcollectorship.<ref name=EB1911/><ref>Hay 1952, pp. 10\u201313.</ref>\n\n===Return visits to Italy and death===\nAlthough Vergil lived predominantly in England from 1502 onwards, he paid several return visits to Urbino, in 1513\u201314, 1516\u201317 and 1533\u20134. In 1534, [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere|Francesco Maria]], [[Duke of Urbino]], in recognition of his literary achievements, admitted Vergil and his family to the ranks of the nobility.<ref>Franco Negroni, \"Punctualizzazioni archivistiche sulla famiglia Virgili di Urbino\", in Bacchielli 2003, pp. 39\u201351, at p. 42.</ref> \n\nIn 1546 Vergil resigned the Archdeaconry of Wells to the Crown, perhaps in anticipation of his retirement to Italy. He was licensed to return to Urbino in 1550, and probably left England for the last time in the summer of 1553. He died in Urbino on 18 April 1555.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\n==Works==\n===Perotti's ''Cornucopiae''===\nVergil published his first work in 1496. This was an edition of [[Niccol\u00f2 Perotti]]\u2019s ''Cornucopiae latinae linguae'', a commentary on [[Martial]]'s ''Epigrams''.\n\n===''Proverbiorum Libellus'' (''Adagia'')===\nVergil's ''Proverbiorum Libellus'' (Venice, 1498), retitled in later editions as ''Adagiorum Liber'', and often known as the ''Adagia'', was a collection of Latin proverbs. It was the first such collection printed, preceding the similar ''[[Adagia]]'' of [[Erasmus]] by two years. The initial controversy between the two authors that arose from their rival claims for [[Scientific priority|priority]] (Erasmus still believed as late as 1533 that his work had been the earlier) gave place to a sincere friendship.<ref name=EB1911/><ref name=ODNB/> The first edition of Vergil's work contained 306 proverbs taken from classical sources. A second, expanded, edition appeared in 1521: it contained a further series of 431 Biblical proverbs, and was dedicated to Wolsey's follower, [[Richard Pace]].<ref name=EB1911/> This edition is preceded by an interesting letter sent in June 1519, which gives the names of many of Vergil's English friends, including [[Thomas More]], [[William Warham]], [[Thomas Linacre]] and [[Cuthbert Tunstall]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe ''Adagia'' ran through about 20 editions down to 1550.\n\n===''De Inventoribus Rerum''===\nVergil's ''De Inventoribus Rerum'' was published in 1499, having been written in only three months. It was a history of origins and inventions, describing in three books the \"first begetters\" of all human activities. Book I investigated the origin of the gods and the word \"God\", along with such matters as the creation, marriage, religion and learning. Book II covered, among other topics, the origins of law, time, military science, money, precious metals and art. Book III covered, again among other topics, the origins of agriculture, architecture, towns, theatres, tools and materials, maritime navigation, commerce and prostitution.\n\nFor the edition of 1521, Vergil added five more books, devoted to the ''initia institorum rei Christianae'', i.e. the origins of Christian rites and institutions. He probably thought that this addition would be a popular one, but it was also a concession towards critics who had labelled the ''De Inventoribus'' a work of heretics and depravity. The work nonetheless included criticisms of monks, priestly celibacy, indulgences, and of the policies and constitutional status of the papacy. As a consequence it was placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (papal list of prohibited books) in 1564: an expurgated text, sanctioned by [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]], was published in 1576.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n''De Inventoribus'' was, however, exceedingly popular, and was quickly translated into French (1521), German (1537), English (1546) and Spanish (1551).<ref name=EB1911/> Thirty Latin editions had been published by the time Vergil died in 1555; and the work eventually ran to around 70 Latin editions, and another 35 translations.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 52, 74.</ref> The English edition of 1546 was an abridgement made by [[Thomas Langley (priest)|Thomas Langley]], which also proved highly successful and was reprinted several times.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 66\u201369.</ref>\n\nThe work is notable for the immense industry that went into its compilation, and the range of ancient and modern writers on which Vergil was able to draw.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 54\u201359.</ref>\n\n===''Gildas \u2026de calamitate, excidio et conquestu Britanniae''===\nIn 1525 Vergil published an edition of [[Gildas]]' 6th-century history, ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'', probably at [[Antwerp]].<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 29\u201330.</ref> He dedicated it to [[Cuthbert Tunstall]], [[Bishop of London]]. This was the first critical edition of a British historical text.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 17, 30.</ref><ref>Galdieri 1993, p. 319.</ref> In publishing it, Vergil reflected a growing interest in post-classical texts among German and Italian scholars. This interest sprang mainly from self-conscious nationalism which makes it curious at least that a foreigner chose a text about Britain. Vergil did, however, have a motive; this project provided a background for his anti-Arthurian position. Tunstall supplied one of the source [[manuscript]]s (hence the dedication), and the work of editing was undertaken by Vergil and [[Robert Ridley]]. Their editing was for the most part conscientious, although they rearranged certain words in the interests of clarity, and also suppressed a few [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] passages.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\n===''Dialogus de Prodigiis''===\nVergil's ''Dialogus de Prodigiis'' was written in 1526\u20137, and printed in 1531. It was dedicated to [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere|Francesco Maria]], [[Duke of Urbino]].<ref name=EB1911/> This treatise, in three books, takes the form of a Latin dialogue between Vergil and his Cambridge friend Robert Ridley<ref name=EB1911/> on the subject of the natural and the supernatural, and whether credence should be given to such alleged phenomena as prodigious events and portents. The setting for the dialogue is the open air, at Vergil's country house near London. Vergil's role is to state the problems and supply the historical illustrations; his friend's to explain, rationalise and depreciate as best he can.<ref name=EB1911/><ref>Hay 1952, pp. 34\u201345.</ref>\n\nThe ''De Prodigiis'' also achieved great popularity, and was translated into Italian (1543), English (1546) and Spanish (1550).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===''Anglica Historia''===\nVergil's history of England, the ''Anglica Historia'', was begun at the instigation of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], perhaps as early as 1505. This first version was completed in 1512\u201313. However, the work was not published until 1534; and four distinct versions can therefore be identified:\n\n# Manuscript written in 1512\u201313: covering events up to 1513 (MS)\n# First edition, Basle, 1534, [[Folio (printing)|folio]]; covering events up to 1509 (A)\n# Second edition, Basle, 1546, folio: covering events up to 1509 (B)\n# Third edition, Basle, 1555, folio: covering events up to 1537 (C)\n\nThe manuscript version is now held in the [[Vatican Library]]. Comprising two volumes, it was presented to the ducal library at Urbino in 1613 by Vergil's grand-nephew. Although he stated in prefatory notes that the manuscript was written in Vergil's hand \u2013 an assessment fully supported by the [[Palaeography|palaeographic]] evidence \u2013 it was at one time sometimes attributed to [[Federico Veterani]]. This misunderstanding arose from a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] in the second volume, in a different hand, stating that \"I, Federico Veterani, wrote the whole work\". A possible explanation is that Vergil left it in the care of Veterani, who inscribed the colophon to associate it with his other treasures so that it would not be lost or damaged during the [[Papal invasion in Urbino]] in 1516. Further isolated notes in Veterani's hand, nearly all directions to a binder or printer, are found throughout the manuscript. The most plausible interpretation of the evidence is that Vergil intended to present a fine manuscript (rather than a printed book) to Henry VIII, and commissioned the work from Veterani, the most famous copyist of the day. However, no such copy by Veterani is known to have survived.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 79\u201381.</ref>\n\nThe manuscript version of the work was divided into 25 books. Books I\u2013VII described the early history of England up to the Norman conquest; Book VIII dealt with the reigns of [[William the Conqueror|William I]] and [[William II of England|William II]]; and the following books covered one reign per book, ending in book XXV which dealt with the beginning of Henry VIII's reign to 1513.\n\nIn 1534 the first printed version of the work appeared, a folio with decorations from [[John Bebel]]\u2019s press in [[Basle]]. While this edition was broadly similar to the manuscript, it incorporated substantial changes, and it seems that Vergil effectively made a fresh start using the manuscript as a guideline. The rewriting appears to have taken place between 1521 and 1524 (based on one reference to his having been archdeacon of Wells for fourteen years; and another allusion to \"this day, which is 1524\"). Book VII of the manuscript was now split into two parts, the new book VIII running from the death of [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] to 1066; while the reigns of the first two [[Normans|Norman]] kings, previously covered in a single book, were also divided between two books. The work had therefore gained two books, but now ended with book XXVI in 1509, no longer extending into the reign of Henry VIII.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\nThe second edition appeared in 1546. This version also ended in 1509, but was much revised. The revisions included rewordings for political reasons, a greater emphasis on the civic history of London, and stylistic improvements of the Latin for European readers.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 82\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe third edition was published in 1555, the year of Vergil's death. In this case the revisions were minor and largely stylistic. However, Vergil added a new book (XXVII) giving an account of Henry VIII's reign to 1537, and which included a highly critical portrait of Wolsey. Vergil claimed that most of his work on the last book was done contemporaneously, and that the work was interrupted by a visit to Italy. This must refer to his visit of 1533\u201334, and the entire period from 1530 to 1537 is in fact treated cursorily. [[Denys Hay]] finds it reasonable to suppose that at first Vergil planned this book to describe events up to 1530, but that he postponed the publication of it due to the political uncertainties in England, enabling him to extend the terminal date.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nVergil drew on an impressively wide range of sources for his work, including published books and [[Oral tradition|oral testimony]].<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 85\u201395.</ref> He claimed to have been diligent in collecting materials, and to have drawn on the work of foreign as well as English historians. For this reason, he remarked, the English, Scots and French would find things reported in his pages far differently from the way they were used to hearing them within their own countries.<ref name=EB1911/> In his search for information he applied to [[James IV of Scotland]] for a list of the Scottish kings and their annals; but not even his friendship with [[Gavin Douglas]] could make him accept the historical theories of the latter, who traced the pedigree of the Scots down from the banished son of an [[King of Athens|Athenian king]] and [[Scota]], daughter of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Pharaoh]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nVergil opened the ''Anglica Historia'' with a passage heavily influenced by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'':\n<blockquote>Britannia omnis...diuiditur in partes quatuor: quarum unam incolunt Angli, aliam Scoti, tertiam Vualli, quartam Cornubienses. Hi omnes uel lingua; uel moribus seu institutis inter se differunt.<ref>Polydore Vergil, ''Anglicae Historiae'' (Basel 1557), p. 3.</ref></blockquote>\nIn an early English translation, this is rendered as:\n<blockquote>The whole Countrie of Britaine...is divided into iiij partes ; wherof the one is inhabited of [[English people|Englishmen]], the other of [[Scottish people|Scottes]], the third of [[Welsh people|Wallshemen]], and the fowerth of [[Cornish people|Cornishe people]]. Which all differ emonge them selves, either in tongue, either in manners, or ells in lawes and ordinaunces.<ref>{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Polydore Vergil's English history, from an early translation: Vol. I |editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-last=Ellis |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=36 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1846 |page=1 }}</ref><ref>The opening lines to Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Gallic War]]'' read in English as follows: \"Gaul as a whole is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts (in ours Gauls), the third. All these differ from each other in language, customs and laws.\"</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Other works===\nVergil published a ''Commentariolum in Dominicam Precem'' (\"Commentary on the Lord's Prayer\") at Basle in 1525, accompanying an edition of the ''De Inventoribus Rerum''. His comments owed much to Erasmus' ''Precatio Dominica in septem portiones distributa'' (1523).<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 31\u201334.</ref>\n\nAt Erasmus' request, Vergil worked on a translation from the Greek of [[Dio Chrysostom]]'s ''De Perfecto Monacho'', which he published in 1533.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> It was reprinted in 1541 and 1550.\n\nIn 1545, he published his last work, the ''Dialogorum libri'', a collection of Latin dialogues, divided into three parts as ''De patientia'', ''De vita perfecta'', and ''De veritate et mendacio''.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 45\u201349.</ref>\n\n==Commemoration==\nVergil was buried in [[Urbino Cathedral]], in the chapel of St Andrew which he himself had endowed. In 1613, it was agreed that a memorial stone should be set over his tomb. This was eventually put in place in 1631, with an inscription stating that his fame would \"live for ever in the world\".<ref>Negroni, \"Punctualizzazioni archivistiche\", pp. 42\u201345.</ref> However, it is believed to have been lost when the cathedral was severely damaged by an earthquake in 1789.\n\nVergil's family home and alleged birthplace in Urbino (now a property of the [[University of Urbino]]) is marked by a plaque; and there is also a bust of him in the city, unveiled in 2000.<ref>Bacchielli 2003, pp. 75, 277.</ref>\n\nVergil is among the worthies whose portraits were painted in ''c''.1618\u201319 on the frieze in what is now the Upper Reading Room of the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford.<ref>{{cite journal |first=M.R.A. |last=Bullard |title=Talking heads: the Bodleian frieze, its inspiration, sources, designer and significance |journal=Bodleian Library Record |volume=14 |date=1991\u201394 |pages=461\u2013500 }}</ref>\n\n==Reputation and legacy==\nIn continental Europe, Vergil is principally remembered for the ''De Inventoribus Rerum'' and the ''Adagia'': these are the works which secured his reputation before he ever came to England, and which he himself regarded as his masterpieces, writing \"I, Polydore, was the first of the Romans to treat of these two matters\".<ref>Hay 1949, p. 135.</ref> The ''De Inventoribus'' receives a mention, for example, in [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605\u201315).<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn England, however, Vergil is more often remembered as author of the ''Anglica Historia''. The work is an important [[primary source]] in its own right for the period 1460\u20131537, and as a [[secondary source]] continued to exert an influence on English [[historiography]] into the 19th century. It provided the chronicler [[Edward Hall]] with much of his sense of 15th-century English history, and so fed into the [[Shakespearean history|history plays]] of [[William Shakespeare]].<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 127\u201328, 131\u201335, 155\u201368.</ref><ref>Galdieri 1993, p. 317.</ref>\n\nA particularly controversial element of Vergil's work in England was the scepticism he expressed \u2013 first in his edition of Gildas, and then in the ''Anglica Historia'' \u2013 towards the traditional account of the early history of Britain derived from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], and in particular towards the question of the [[historicity]] of [[King Arthur]]. This criticism touched a patriotic nerve with the antiquary [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], who responded forcefully, first in an unpublished tract, written perhaps in 1536, the ''Codrus sive Laus et Defensio Gallofridi Arturii contra Polydorum Vergilium'' (\"Codrus\", a reference to Vergil, was a type-name drawn from [[Juvenal]] for an offensive hack-poet); and afterwards in a longer published treatment, the ''Assertio inclytissimi Arturii regis Britannia'' (1544).<ref>Carley 1996.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Carley, James P., ed. |title=De uiris illustribus: On Famous Men |location=Toronto and Oxford |year=2010 |pages=xlii, cxv\u2013cxxvii }}</ref> Although Leland was critical of Vergil's views in the ''Assertio'', he treated his opponent with respect, acknowledging his intelligence and his mastery of Latin style.\n\nOn another contentious issue, Vergil came down in favour of the claims of the [[University of Cambridge]] to be a more ancient foundation than the [[University of Oxford]]. When this was mentioned in a debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1628, the [[Oxonian]] [[Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Littleton of Mounslow|Edward Littleton]] sneered, \"What have we to do with Polydore Vergil?

[[John Bale]] in 1544 accused Vergil of \"polutynge our Englyshe chronycles most shamefullye with his Romishe lyes and other Italyshe beggerye\".<ref>Quoted in Connell 2004.</ref> An anonymous contemporary described him as \"that most rascall dogge knave in the worlde\", claiming that \"he had the randsackings of all the Englishe lybraryes, and when he had extracted what he pleased he burnt those famous [[vellum|velome]] manuscripts, and made himself father to other mens workes\".<ref>Quoted in Hay 1952, p. 159.</ref> This charge of burning manuscripts was widely reported. [[John Caius]] in 1574, for example, asserted that Vergil had \"committed as many of our ancient and manuscript historians to the flames as would have filled a waggon, that the faults of his own work might pass undiscovered\".<ref>Translated in {{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Three Books of Polydore Vergil's English History |editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-last=Ellis |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=29 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1844 |page=xxiii }}</ref> [[Henry Peacham (born 1578)|Henry Peacham]] in 1622 similarly accused him of having \"burned and embezeled the best and most ancient Records and Monuments of our Abbeies, Priories, and Cathedrall Churches, under colour \u2026 of making search for all such monuments, manusc. records, Legier bookes, &c. as might make for his purpose\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Peacham |first=Henry |title=The Compleat Gentleman |place=London |year=1622 |page=51 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, one of Peacham's contemporaries, the Leicestershire antiquary [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Burton]], cast Vergil in a more positive light, describing him as \"a man of singular invention, good judgement, and good reading, and a true lover of antiquities\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Three Books of Polydore Vergil's English History |editor-last=Ellis |editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=29 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1844 |page=xxv }}</ref> In the 19th century, Vergil's importance to English historiography finally began to be acknowledged, as \"historians of Tudor England realized the scope of his achievement in the ''Anglica Historia''\".<ref>Galdieri 1993, p. 320.</ref>\n\n==Modern editions/translations of works==\n===''De inventoribus rerum''===\n*{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=De Rerum Inventoribus |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924026509145 |editor1-first=John (translator) |editor1-last=Langley |editor2-first=William A. |editor2-last=Hammond |editor2-link=William Alexander Hammond |place=New York |publisher=Agathynian Club |year=1868 }} An English translation of Books 1\u20139 (with some abridgements), originally published in London in 1663.\n*{{cite book |translator1-first=Beno |translator1-last=Weiss |translator2-first=Louis C. |translator2-last=P\u00e9rez |title=Beginnings and Discoveries: Polydore Vergil's De inventoribus rerum |place=Nieuwkoop |publisher=De Graaf |year=1997 |isbn=9060044290 }} An English translation of Books 1\u20138, based on the 1546 Lyon edition.\n*{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=On Discovery |editor-first=Brian P. |editor-last=Copenhaver |editor-link=Brian Copenhaver |series=I Tatti Renaissance Library |place=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2002 |ISBN=0-674-00789-1 }} [[Parallel text|Parallel]] Latin and English texts of Books 1\u20133, collating early editions to 1553\u201355.\n\n===''Anglica Historia''===\n*{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Polydore Vergil's English history, from an early translation preserved among the MSS of the Old Royal Library in the British Museum: Vol. I, containing the first eight books, comprising the period prior to the Norman Conquest|editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-last=Ellis |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=36 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1846 }}\n*{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Three books of Polydore Vergil's English history, comprising the reigns of Henry VI, Edward IV, and Richard III; from an early translation, preserved among the MSS of the Old Royal Library in the British Museum |editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-last=Ellis |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=29 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1844 }}\n*{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=The Anglica historia of Polydore Vergil, A.D. 1485\u20131537 |editor-first=Denys |editor-last=Hay |editor-link=Denys Hay |place=London |publisher=Royal Historical Society |series=Camden 3rd series |volume=74 |year=1950 }} Latin text and English translation.\n*[http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/polverg/ Anglica Historia], Latin text and English translation (ed. and trans.

He is particularly remembered for his works the ''Proverbiorum libellus'' (1498), a collection of Latin proverbs; ''De inventoribus rerum'' (1499), a history of discoveries and origins; and the ''Anglica Historia'' (drafted by 1513; printed 1534), an influential history of England.

Now the Music School of [[Wells Cathedral School]]]]\nIn 1502, Vergil travelled to England as the deputy of Cardinal [[Adriano Castellesi]] in the office of Collector of [[Peter's Pence]], and, in practice, the Cardinal's agent in a variety of affairs. In October 1504 he was enthroned [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] as proxy for Adriano;<ref name=EB1911/> and in 1508 he himself was installed as [[List of Archdeacons of Wells|Archdeacon of Wells]]. He probably spent little time in Wells, but was active as the Chapter's representative in London.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 8\u20139, 19\u201320.</ref> He also donated a set of hangings for the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]] of [[Wells Cathedral]].<ref>Harris 2005.</ref> He held other ecclesiastical [[sinecure]]s, including, from 1503, the living of [[East Langton|Church Langton]], Leicestershire; from 1508 [[Prebendary|prebends]] in [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and [[Hereford Cathedral]]s; and from 1513 the prebend of Oxgate in [[St Paul's Cathedral]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAs an established author, and a representative of Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] learning, Vergil was received in England as a minor celebrity, and was welcomed at court by King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]].<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> It was at the King's behest that he began work on his ''Anglica Historia'', a new history of England, probably as early as 1505.\n\nOn 22 October 1510, he was [[Naturalization|naturalised]] English.\n\nEarly in 1515 \u2013 through the intrigues of [[Andrea Ammonio]], who sought the subcollectorship for himself \u2013 an ill-judged letter from Vergil was intercepted by the authorities. It contained what was read as implied criticism of both [[Thomas Wolsey]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and as a result Vergil was imprisoned in April in the [[Tower of London]]. His supporters and advocates included [[Pope Leo X]], who wrote to the King on his behalf.<ref name=EB1911/> From prison Vergil wrote to Wolsey, begging that the approaching Christmas season \u2013 a time which witnessed the restitution of a world \u2013 might also see his pardon: his letter's tone has been described as \"almost blasphemous\".<ref name=EB1911/> He was released before Christmas 1515, but never regained his subcollectorship.<ref name=EB1911/><ref>Hay 1952, pp. 10\u201313.</ref>\n\n===Return visits to Italy and death===\nAlthough Vergil lived predominantly in England from 1502 onwards, he paid several return visits to Urbino, in 1513\u201314, 1516\u201317 and 1533\u20134. In 1534, [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere|Francesco Maria]], [[Duke of Urbino]], in recognition of his literary achievements, admitted Vergil and his family to the ranks of the nobility.<ref>Franco Negroni, \"Punctualizzazioni archivistiche sulla famiglia Virgili di Urbino\", in Bacchielli 2003, pp. 39\u201351, at p. 42.</ref> \n\nIn 1546 Vergil resigned the Archdeaconry of Wells to the Crown, perhaps in anticipation of his retirement to Italy. He was licensed to return to Urbino in 1550, and probably left England for the last time in the summer of 1553. He died in Urbino on 18 April 1555.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\n==Works==\n===Perotti's ''Cornucopiae''===\nVergil published his first work in 1496. This was an edition of [[Niccol\u00f2 Perotti]]\u2019s ''Cornucopiae latinae linguae'', a commentary on [[Martial]]'s ''Epigrams''.\n\n===''Proverbiorum Libellus'' (''Adagia'')===\nVergil's ''Proverbiorum Libellus'' (Venice, 1498), retitled in later editions as ''Adagiorum Liber'', and often known as the ''Adagia'', was a collection of Latin proverbs. It was the first such collection printed, preceding the similar ''[[Adagia]]'' of [[Erasmus]] by two years. The initial controversy between the two authors that arose from their rival claims for [[Scientific priority|priority]] (Erasmus still believed as late as 1533 that his work had been the earlier) gave place to a sincere friendship.<ref name=EB1911/><ref name=ODNB/> The first edition of Vergil's work contained 306 proverbs taken from classical sources. A second, expanded, edition appeared in 1521: it contained a further series of 431 Biblical proverbs, and was dedicated to Wolsey's follower, [[Richard Pace]].<ref name=EB1911/> This edition is preceded by an interesting letter sent in June 1519, which gives the names of many of Vergil's English friends, including [[Thomas More]], [[William Warham]], [[Thomas Linacre]] and [[Cuthbert Tunstall]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe ''Adagia'' ran through about 20 editions down to 1550.\n\n===''De Inventoribus Rerum''===\nVergil's ''De Inventoribus Rerum'' was published in 1499, having been written in only three months. It was a history of origins and inventions, describing in three books the \"first begetters\" of all human activities. Book I investigated the origin of the gods and the word \"God\", along with such matters as the creation, marriage, religion and learning. Book II covered, among other topics, the origins of law, time, military science, money, precious metals and art. Book III covered, again among other topics, the origins of agriculture, architecture, towns, theatres, tools and materials, maritime navigation, commerce and prostitution.\n\nFor the edition of 1521, Vergil added five more books, devoted to the ''initia institorum rei Christianae'', i.e. the origins of Christian rites and institutions. He probably thought that this addition would be a popular one, but it was also a concession towards critics who had labelled the ''De Inventoribus'' a work of heretics and depravity. The work nonetheless included criticisms of monks, priestly celibacy, indulgences, and of the policies and constitutional status of the papacy. As a consequence it was placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (papal list of prohibited books) in 1564: an expurgated text, sanctioned by [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]], was published in 1576.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n''De Inventoribus'' was, however, exceedingly popular, and was quickly translated into French (1521), German (1537), English (1546) and Spanish (1551).<ref name=EB1911/> Thirty Latin editions had been published by the time Vergil died in 1555; and the work eventually ran to around 70 Latin editions, and another 35 translations.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 52, 74.</ref> The English edition of 1546 was an abridgement made by [[Thomas Langley (priest)|Thomas Langley]], which also proved highly successful and was reprinted several times.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 66\u201369.</ref>\n\nThe work is notable for the immense industry that went into its compilation, and the range of ancient and modern writers on which Vergil was able to draw.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 54\u201359.</ref>\n\n===''Gildas \u2026de calamitate, excidio et conquestu Britanniae''===\nIn 1525 Vergil published an edition of [[Gildas]]' 6th-century history, ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'', probably at [[Antwerp]].<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 29\u201330.</ref> He dedicated it to [[Cuthbert Tunstall]], [[Bishop of London]]. This was the first critical edition of a British historical text.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 17, 30.</ref><ref>Galdieri 1993, p. 319.</ref> In publishing it, Vergil reflected a growing interest in post-classical texts among German and Italian scholars. This interest sprang mainly from self-conscious nationalism which makes it curious at least that a foreigner chose a text about Britain. Vergil did, however, have a motive; this project provided a background for his anti-Arthurian position. Tunstall supplied one of the source [[manuscript]]s (hence the dedication), and the work of editing was undertaken by Vergil and [[Robert Ridley]]. Their editing was for the most part conscientious, although they rearranged certain words in the interests of clarity, and also suppressed a few [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] passages.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\n===''Dialogus de Prodigiis''===\nVergil's ''Dialogus de Prodigiis'' was written in 1526\u20137, and printed in 1531. It was dedicated to [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere|Francesco Maria]], [[Duke of Urbino]].<ref name=EB1911/> This treatise, in three books, takes the form of a Latin dialogue between Vergil and his Cambridge friend Robert Ridley<ref name=EB1911/> on the subject of the natural and the supernatural, and whether credence should be given to such alleged phenomena as prodigious events and portents. The setting for the dialogue is the open air, at Vergil's country house near London. Vergil's role is to state the problems and supply the historical illustrations; his friend's to explain, rationalise and depreciate as best he can.<ref name=EB1911/><ref>Hay 1952, pp. 34\u201345.</ref>\n\nThe ''De Prodigiis'' also achieved great popularity, and was translated into Italian (1543), English (1546) and Spanish (1550).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===''Anglica Historia''===\nVergil's history of England, the ''Anglica Historia'', was begun at the instigation of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], perhaps as early as 1505. This first version was completed in 1512\u201313. However, the work was not published until 1534; and four distinct versions can therefore be identified:\n\n# Manuscript written in 1512\u201313: covering events up to 1513 (MS)\n# First edition, Basle, 1534, [[Folio (printing)|folio]]; covering events up to 1509 (A)\n# Second edition, Basle, 1546, folio: covering events up to 1509 (B)\n# Third edition, Basle, 1555, folio: covering events up to 1537 (C)\n\nThe manuscript version is now held in the [[Vatican Library]]. Comprising two volumes, it was presented to the ducal library at Urbino in 1613 by Vergil's grand-nephew. Although he stated in prefatory notes that the manuscript was written in Vergil's hand \u2013 an assessment fully supported by the [[Palaeography|palaeographic]] evidence \u2013 it was at one time sometimes attributed to [[Federico Veterani]]. This misunderstanding arose from a [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] in the second volume, in a different hand, stating that \"I, Federico Veterani, wrote the whole work\". A possible explanation is that Vergil left it in the care of Veterani, who inscribed the colophon to associate it with his other treasures so that it would not be lost or damaged during the [[Papal invasion in Urbino]] in 1516. Further isolated notes in Veterani's hand, nearly all directions to a binder or printer, are found throughout the manuscript. The most plausible interpretation of the evidence is that Vergil intended to present a fine manuscript (rather than a printed book) to Henry VIII, and commissioned the work from Veterani, the most famous copyist of the day. However, no such copy by Veterani is known to have survived.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 79\u201381.</ref>\n\nThe manuscript version of the work was divided into 25 books. Books I-VII described the early history of England up to the Norman conquest; Book VIII dealt with the reigns of [[William the Conqueror|William I]] and [[William II of England|William II]]; and the following books covered one reign per book, ending in book XXV which dealt with the beginning of Henry VIII's reign to 1513.\n\nIn 1534 the first printed version of the work appeared, a folio with decorations from [[John Bebel]]\u2019s press in [[Basle]]. While this edition was broadly similar to the manuscript, it incorporated substantial changes, and it seems that Vergil effectively made a fresh start using the manuscript as a guideline. The rewriting appears to have taken place between 1521 and 1524 (based on one reference to his having been archdeacon of Wells for fourteen years; and another allusion to \"this day, which is 1524\"). Book VII of the manuscript was now split into two parts, the new book VIII running from the death of [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] to 1066; while the reigns of the first two [[Normans|Norman]] kings, previously covered in a single book, were also divided between two books. The work had therefore gained two books, but now ended with book XXVI in 1509, no longer extending into the reign of Henry VIII.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n\nThe second edition appeared in 1546. This version also ended in 1509, but was much revised. The revisions included rewordings for political reasons, a greater emphasis on the civic history of London, and stylistic improvements of the Latin for European readers.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 82\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe third edition was published in 1555, the year of Vergil's death. In this case the revisions were minor and largely stylistic. However, Vergil added a new book (XXVII) giving an account of Henry VIII's reign to 1537, and which included a highly critical portrait of Wolsey. Vergil claimed that most of his work on the last book was done contemporaneously, and that the work was interrupted by a visit to Italy. This must refer to his visit of 1533\u20134, and the entire period from 1530 to 1537 is in fact treated cursorily. [[Denys Hay]] finds it reasonable to suppose that at first Vergil planned this book to describe events up to 1530, but that he postponed the publication of it due to the political uncertainties in England, enabling him to extend the terminal date.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nVergil drew on an impressively wide range of sources for his work, including published books and [[Oral tradition|oral testimony]].<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 85\u201395.</ref> He claimed to have been diligent in collecting materials, and to have drawn on the work of foreign as well as English historians. For this reason, he remarked, the English, Scots and French would find things reported in his pages far differently from the way they were used to hearing them within their own countries.<ref name=EB1911/> In his search for information he applied to [[James IV of Scotland]] for a list of the Scottish kings and their annals; but not even his friendship with [[Gavin Douglas]] could make him accept the historical theories of the latter, who traced the pedigree of the Scots down from the banished son of an [[King of Athens|Athenian king]] and [[Scota]], daughter of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Pharaoh]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nVergil opened the ''Anglica Historia'' with a passage heavily influenced by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'':\n<blockquote>Britannia omnis...diuiditur in partes quatuor: quarum unam incolunt Angli, aliam Scoti, tertiam Vualli, quartam Cornubienses. Hi omnes uel lingua; uel moribus seu institutis inter se differunt.<ref>Polydore Vergil, ''Anglicae Historiae'' (Basel 1557), p. 3.</ref></blockquote>\nIn an early English translation, this is rendered as:\n<blockquote>The whole Countrie of Britaine...is divided into iiij partes ; wherof the one is inhabited of [[English people|Englishmen]], the other of [[Scottish people|Scottes]], the third of [[Welsh people|Wallshemen]], and the fowerth of [[Cornish people|Cornishe people]]. Which all differ emonge them selves, either in tongue, either in manners, or ells in lawes and ordinaunces.<ref>{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Polydore Vergil's English history, from an early translation: Vol. I |editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-last=Ellis |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=36 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1846 |page=1 }}</ref><ref>The opening lines to Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Gallic War]]'' read in English as follows: \"Gaul as a whole is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts (in ours Gauls), the third. All these differ from each other in language, customs and laws.\"</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Other works===\nVergil published a ''Commentariolum in Dominicam Precem'' (\"Commentary on the Lord's Prayer\") at Basle in 1525, accompanying an edition of the ''De Inventoribus Rerum''. His comments owed much to Erasmus' ''Precatio Dominica in septem portiones distributa'' (1523).<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 31\u201334.</ref>\n\nAt Erasmus' request, Vergil worked on a translation from the Greek of [[Dio Chrysostom]]'s ''De Perfecto Monacho'', which he published in 1533.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> It was reprinted in 1541 and 1550.\n\nIn 1545, he published his last work, the ''Dialogorum libri'', a collection of Latin dialogues, divided into three parts as ''De patientia'', ''De vita perfecta'', and ''De veritate et mendacio''.<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 45\u201349.</ref>\n\n==Commemoration==\nVergil was buried in [[Urbino Cathedral]], in the chapel of St Andrew which he himself had endowed. In 1613, it was agreed that a memorial stone should be set over his tomb. This was eventually put in place in 1631, with an inscription stating that his fame would \"live for ever in the world\".<ref>Negroni, \"Punctualizzazioni archivistiche\", pp. 42\u201345.</ref> However, it is believed to have been lost when the cathedral was severely damaged by an earthquake in 1789.\n\nVergil's family home and alleged birthplace in Urbino (now a property of the [[University of Urbino]]) is marked by a plaque; and there is also a bust of him in the city, unveiled in 2000.<ref>Bacchielli 2003, pp. 75, 277.</ref>\n\nVergil is among the worthies whose portraits were painted in ''c''.1618\u201319 on the frieze in what is now the Upper Reading Room of the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford.<ref>{{cite journal |first=M.R.A. |last=Bullard |title=Talking heads: the Bodleian frieze, its inspiration, sources, designer and significance |journal=Bodleian Library Record |volume=14 |date=1991\u201394 |pages=461\u2013500 }}</ref>\n\n==Reputation and legacy==\nIn continental Europe, Vergil is principally remembered for the ''De Inventoribus Rerum'' and the ''Adagia'': these are the works which secured his reputation before he ever came to England, and which he himself regarded as his masterpieces, writing \"I, Polydore, was the first of the Romans to treat of these two matters\".<ref>Hay 1949, p. 135.</ref> The ''De Inventoribus'' receives a mention, for example, in [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605\u201315).<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn England, however, Vergil is more often remembered as author of the ''Anglica Historia''. The work is an important [[primary source]] in its own right for the period 1460\u20131537, and as a [[secondary source]] continued to exert an influence on English [[historiography]] into the 19th century. It provided the chronicler [[Edward Hall]] with much of his sense of 15th-century English history, and so fed into the [[Shakespearean history|history plays]] of [[William Shakespeare]].<ref>Hay 1952, pp. 127\u201328, 131\u201335, 155\u201368.</ref><ref>Galdieri 1993, p. 317.</ref>\n\nA particularly controversial element of Vergil's work in England was the scepticism he expressed \u2013 first in his edition of Gildas, and then in the ''Anglica Historia'' \u2013 towards the traditional account of the early history of Britain derived from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], and in particular towards the question of the [[historicity]] of [[King Arthur]]. This criticism touched a patriotic nerve with the antiquary [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], who responded forcefully, first in an unpublished tract, written perhaps in 1536, the ''Codrus sive Laus et Defensio Gallofridi Arturii contra Polydorum Vergilium'' (\"Codrus\", a reference to Vergil, was a type-name drawn from [[Juvenal]] for an offensive hack-poet); and afterwards in a longer published treatment, the ''Assertio inclytissimi Arturii regis Britannia'' (1544).<ref>Carley 1996.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Carley, James P., ed. |title=De uiris illustribus: On Famous Men |location=Toronto and Oxford |year=2010 |pages=xlii, cxv\u2013cxxvii }}</ref> Although Leland was critical of Vergil's views in the ''Assertio'', he treated his opponent with respect, acknowledging his intelligence and his mastery of Latin style.\n\nOn another contentious issue, Vergil came down in favour of the claims of the [[University of Cambridge]] to be a more ancient foundation than the [[University of Oxford]]. When this was mentioned in a debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1628, the [[Oxonian]] [[Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Littleton of Mounslow|Edward Littleton]] sneered, \"What have we to do with Polydore Vergil? One [[Virgil|Vergil]] was a poet, the other a liar.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=D.R. |last=Woolf |authorlink=Daniel Woolf |title=Reading History in Early Modern England |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |page=[https://archive.org/details/readinghistoryin0000wool/page/24 24] |isbn=0521780462 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/readinghistoryin0000wool/page/24 }}</ref>\n\nOther English readers also reacted vehemently to what seemed to be criticisms of their national history. [[John Bale]] in 1544 accused Vergil of \"polutynge our Englyshe chronycles most shamefullye with his Romishe lyes and other Italyshe beggerye\".<ref>Quoted in Connell 2004.</ref> An anonymous contemporary described him as \"that most rascall dogge knave in the worlde\", claiming that \"he had the randsackings of all the Englishe lybraryes, and when he had extracted what he pleased he burnt those famous [[vellum|velome]] manuscripts, and made himself father to other mens workes\".<ref>Quoted in Hay 1952, p. 159.</ref> This charge of burning manuscripts was widely reported. [[John Caius]] in 1574, for example, asserted that Vergil had \"committed as many of our ancient and manuscript historians to the flames as would have filled a waggon, that the faults of his own work might pass undiscovered\".<ref>Translated in {{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Three Books of Polydore Vergil's English History |editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-last=Ellis |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=29 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1844 |page=xxiii }}</ref> [[Henry Peacham (born 1578)|Henry Peacham]] in 1622 similarly accused him of having \"burned and embezeled the best and most ancient Records and Monuments of our Abbeies, Priories, and Cathedrall Churches, under colour \u2026 of making search for all such monuments, manusc. records, Legier bookes, &c. as might make for his purpose\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Peacham |first=Henry |title=The Compleat Gentleman |place=London |year=1622 |page=51 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, one of Peacham's contemporaries, the Leicestershire antiquary [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Burton]], cast Vergil in a more positive light, describing him as \"a man of singular invention, good judgement, and good reading, and a true lover of antiquities\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Three Books of Polydore Vergil's English History |editor-last=Ellis |editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=29 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1844 |page=xxv }}</ref> In the 19th century, Vergil's importance to English historiography finally began to be acknowledged, as \"historians of Tudor England realized the scope of his achievement in the ''Anglica Historia''\".<ref>Galdieri 1993, p. 320.</ref>\n\n==Modern editions/translations of works==\n===''De inventoribus rerum''===\n*{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=De Rerum Inventoribus |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924026509145 |editor1-first=John (translator) |editor1-last=Langley |editor2-first=William A. |editor2-last=Hammond |editor2-link=William Alexander Hammond |place=New York |publisher=Agathynian Club |year=1868 }} An English translation of Books 1\u20139 (with some abridgements), originally published in London in 1663.\n*{{cite book |translator1-first=Beno |translator1-last=Weiss |translator2-first=Louis C. |translator2-last=P\u00e9rez |title=Beginnings and Discoveries: Polydore Vergil's De inventoribus rerum |place=Nieuwkoop |publisher=De Graaf |year=1997 |isbn=9060044290 }} An English translation of Books 1\u20138, based on the 1546 Lyon edition.\n*{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=On Discovery |editor-first=Brian P. |editor-last=Copenhaver |editor-link=Brian Copenhaver |series=I Tatti Renaissance Library |place=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2002 |ISBN=0-674-00789-1 }} [[Parallel text|Parallel]] Latin and English texts of Books 1\u20133, collating early editions to 1553\u201355.\n\n===''Anglica Historia''===\n*{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Polydore Vergil's English history, from an early translation preserved among the MSS of the Old Royal Library in the British Museum: Vol. I, containing the first eight books, comprising the period prior to the Norman Conquest|editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-last=Ellis |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=36 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1846 }}\n*{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=Three books of Polydore Vergil's English history, comprising the reigns of Henry VI, Edward IV, and Richard III; from an early translation, preserved among the MSS of the Old Royal Library in the British Museum |editor-first=Sir Henry |editor-last=Ellis |editor-link=Henry Ellis (librarian) |series=Camden 1st series |volume=29 |place=London |publisher=Camden Society |year=1844 }}\n*{{cite book |first=Polydore |last=Vergil |title=The Anglica historia of Polydore Vergil, A.D. 1485\u20131537 |editor-first=Denys |editor-last=Hay |editor-link=Denys Hay |place=London |publisher=Royal Historical Society |series=Camden 3rd series |volume=74 |year=1950 }} Latin text and English translation.\n*[http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/polverg/ Anglica Historia], Latin text and English translation (ed. and trans.

{"title_page": "Strawman theory", "text_new": "{{short description|Strawman theory (also called the Strawman illusion) is a pseudolegal theory prevalent in various movements}}\n{{About|the pseudolegal theory||Straw man (disambiguation)}}\n'''Strawman theory''' (also called the '''Strawman illusion''') is a [[pseudolaw|pseudolegal]] theory prevalent in various movements such as [[sovereign citizen]], [[tax protester]], [[freeman on the land]], and the [[redemption movement]]. The theory holds that an individual has two personas, one of flesh and the other a separate legal personality (i.e., the \"strawman\"). The idea is that an individual\u2019s debts, liabilities, taxes and legal responsibilities belong to the strawman rather than the physical individual.{{R|\"SPLC1\"}} The strawman theory is recognized in law as a scam: the [[FBI]] considers anyone promoting it a likely fraudster{{R|\"FBI\"}};  the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) considers it a frivolous argument and fines people that use the theory on their Federal tax returns.{{R|\"IRS\"}}{{R|\"Lii\"}}\n\nStrawman theory traces its origins to the ancient Roman legal practice of ''[[capitis deminutio]]'' (\"decrease of head\"), a term used in Roman trials for the [[extinguishment]] of a person's former legal capacity. ''Capitis deminutio minima'' meant a person ceased to belong to a particular family, without loss of liberty or citizenship. ''Capitis deminutio media'' involved loss of citizenship and family, but not liberty. ''Capitis deminutio maxima'' involved loss of family, citizenship and liberty (''i.e.'', a slave or a prisoner of war).{{R|\"Mackenzie1862\"}} Strawman theory commonly takes the term ''capitis deminutio'' spells it \"Capitis Diminutio\" and claims ''capitis diminutio maxima'' was represented by an individual\u2019s name being written in capital letters. This led to the idea that individuals had a separate legal personality now called a \"strawman\".{{R|\"Weill\"}}\n\nThe theory holds that an individual has two personas. One of them is a physical, tangible human being, and the other is the ''legal person'', often referred to as a legal fiction. When a baby is born in the U.S., a birth certificate is issued, and the parents apply for a Social Security number. Sovereigns say the government uses that birth certificate to set up a secret Treasury account which it funds with an amount ranging from $600,000 to $20 million, depending on the particular sovereign belief system. Hence, every newborn's rights are split between those held by the flesh-and-blood baby and the corporate shell account.{{R|\"SPLC1\"}}\n\nProponents of the theory believe the evidence is found on the birth certificate. Because many certificates show all capitals to spell out a baby's name, JOHN DOE (under the Strawman theory) is the name of the \"straw man,\" and John Doe is the baby's \"real\" name. As the child grows, most legal documents will contain capital letters, which means that his state-issued driver's license, his marriage license, his car registration, his criminal court records, his cable TV bill, correspondence from the IRS, etc., pertain to his strawman and not his sovereign identity.{{R|\"SPLC1\"}} In reality, the use of all capital letters is typically done to make certain statements clear and conspicuous, although this is not always the case.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/sovereign-citizens-movement|title=Sovereign Citizens Movement|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe main use of strawman theory is in escaping and denying debts, liabilities and legal responsibility. Tax protesters, \"commercial redemption\" and \"get out of debt free\" scams claim that one\u2019s debts and taxes are the responsibility of the strawman and not of the real person. They back this claim by misreading the legal definition of ''[[person]]''{{R|\"Blacks_Person\"}} and misunderstanding the distinction between a ''[[juridicial person]]''{{R|\"Blacks_Jperson\"}} and a ''[[natural person]]''.{{R|\"Blacks_Nperson\"}} In accepted legal theory there is a difference between what is known as a ''natural person'' and that of a ''corporate person''. A ''[[corporate personhood]]'' applies to business, charities, governments and other recognized organisations. Courts recognize human beings as 'persons', not as a [[Legal fiction|legal fiction]] joined to a flesh and blood human being but as one and the same.{{R|\"CanadaLaw\"}} They have never recognized a right to distance oneself from one's person, or the ability to opt out of personhood.{{R|\"Lovejoy\"}}\n\nBelievers of the theory also extend it to law and legal responsibilities, claiming that only their strawman is required to adhere to statutory laws. They also claim that legal proceedings are taken against strawmen rather than persons and when one appears in court they appear as representing their strawman. The justification for this is the false notion that governments cannot force anybody to do anything. A strawman therefore created which the adherent believes he or she is free to command. Proponents cite a misinterpretation of a passage in chapter 39 of [[John, King of England|King John]]'s [[Magna Carta]] stating in part that, \"no freeman will be seized, dispossessed of his property, or harmed except by the law of the land\u201d.{{R|\"MagnaCarta\"}}\n\nFreemen believe that separating from their strawman or refusing to be identified as such enables escape from their legal liabilities and responsibilities. This is typically attempted by denying they are a 'person' in the same way as their strawman, or by writing their name in non-standard ways, using red ink, and placing finger prints on court documents.{{R|\"Williams\"}}\n\nJudge [[Norman K. Moon]] found such tactics an unconvincing argument in 2013 when an individual named Brandon Gravatt tried to overturn a drug conviction and get out of prison. The case was summarily dismissed by the court.{{R|\"Moon\"}}\n\nIt is impossible to dodge the law by insisting that an individual is different from his or her person. If a court can establish a person's identity, regardless of consent or cooperation, the court will engage in proceedings and sanctions against the individual. This is due to the legal principle known as ''[[Idem sonans]]'' (Latin for \"sounding the same\") which states that similar sounding names are just as valid in referring to a person.{{R|\"Blacks_Idem\"}} The earliest legal precedent is ''R v Davis'' in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851.{{R|\"ARCHBOLD1867\"}}\n\n{{cquote|If two names spelt differently necessarily sound alike, the court may, as matter of law, pronounce them to be idem sonantia; but if they do not necessarily sound alike, the question whether they are idem sonantia is a question of fact for the jury.}}\n\n== Relevant cases ==\n{{dynamic list}}\n \n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Case\n!Defendant\n!Case notes\n!Court Ruling\n|-\n|''United States v.

The theory holds that an individual has two personas, one of flesh and the other a separate legal personality (i.e., the \"strawman\"). The idea is that an individual\u2019s debts, liabilities, taxes and legal responsibilities belong to the strawman rather than the physical individual.{{R|\"SPLC1\"}} The strawman theory is recognized in law as a scam: the [[FBI]] considers anyone promoting it a likely fraudster{{R|\"FBI\"}};  the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) considers it a frivolous argument and fines people that use the theory on their Federal tax returns.{{R|\"IRS\"}}{{R|\"Lii\"}}\n\nStrawman theory traces its origins to the ancient Roman legal practice of ''[[capitis deminutio]]'' (\"decrease of head\"), a term used in Roman trials for the [[extinguishment]] of a person's former legal capacity. ''Capitis deminutio minima'' meant a person ceased to belong to a particular family, without loss of liberty or citizenship. ''Capitis deminutio media'' involved loss of citizenship and family, but not liberty. ''Capitis deminutio maxima'' involved loss of family, citizenship and liberty (''i.e.'', a slave or a prisoner of war).{{R|\"Mackenzie1862\"}} Strawman theory commonly takes the term ''capitis deminutio'' spells it \"Capitis Diminutio\" and claims ''capitis diminutio maxima'' was represented by an individual\u2019s name being written in capital letters. This led to the idea that individuals had a separate legal personality now called a \"strawman\".{{R|\"Weill\"}}\n\nThe theory holds that an individual has two personas. One of them is a physical, tangible human being, and the other is the ''legal person'', often referred to as a legal fiction. When a baby is born in the U.S., a birth certificate is issued, and the parents apply for a Social Security number. Sovereigns say the government uses that birth certificate to set up a secret Treasury account which it funds with an amount ranging from $600,000 to $20 million, depending on the particular sovereign belief system. Hence, every newborn's rights are split between those held by the flesh-and-blood baby and the corporate shell account.{{R|\"SPLC1\"}}\n\nProponents of the theory believe the evidence is found on the birth certificate. Because many certificates show all capitals to spell out a baby's name, JOHN DOE (under the Strawman theory) is the name of the \"straw man,\" and John Doe is the baby's \"real\" name. As the child grows, most legal documents will contain capital letters, which means that his state-issued driver's license, his marriage license, his car registration, his criminal court records, his cable TV bill, correspondence from the IRS, etc., pertain to his strawman and not his sovereign identity.{{R|\"SPLC1\"}} In reality, the use of all capital letters is typically done to make certain statements clear and conspicuous, although this is not always the case.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/sovereign-citizens-movement|title=Sovereign Citizens Movement|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe main use of strawman theory is in escaping and denying debts, liabilities and legal responsibility. Tax protesters, \"commercial redemption\" and \"get out of debt free\" scams claim that one\u2019s debts and taxes are the responsibility of the strawman and not of the real person. They back this claim by misreading the legal definition of ''[[person]]''{{R|\"Blacks_Person\"}} and misunderstanding the distinction between a ''[[juridicial person]]''{{R|\"Blacks_Jperson\"}} and a ''[[natural person]]''.{{R|\"Blacks_Nperson\"}} In accepted legal theory there is a difference between what is known as a ''natural person'' and that of a ''corporate person''. A ''[[corporate personhood]]'' applies to business, charities, governments and other recognized organisations. Courts recognize human beings as 'persons', not as a legal fiction joined to a flesh and blood human being but as one and the same.{{R|\"CanadaLaw\"}} They have never recognized a right to distance oneself from one's person, or the ability to opt out of personhood.{{R|\"Lovejoy\"}}\n\nBelievers of the theory also extend it to law and legal responsibilities, claiming that only their strawman is required to adhere to statutory laws. They also claim that legal proceedings are taken against strawmen rather than persons and when one appears in court they appear as representing their strawman. The justification for this is the false notion that governments cannot force anybody to do anything. A strawman therefore created which the adherent believes he or she is free to command. Proponents cite a misinterpretation of a passage in chapter 39 of [[John, King of England|King John]]'s [[Magna Carta]] stating in part that, \"no freeman will be seized, dispossessed of his property, or harmed except by the law of the land\u201d.{{R|\"MagnaCarta\"}}\n\nFreemen believe that separating from their strawman or refusing to be identified as such enables escape from their legal liabilities and responsibilities. This is typically attempted by denying they are a 'person' in the same way as their strawman, or by writing their name in non-standard ways, using red ink, and placing finger prints on court documents.{{R|\"Williams\"}}\n\nJudge [[Norman K. Moon]] found such tactics an unconvincing argument in 2013 when an individual named Brandon Gravatt tried to overturn a drug conviction and get out of prison. The case was summarily dismissed by the court.{{R|\"Moon\"}}\n\nIt is impossible to dodge the law by insisting that an individual is different from his or her person. If a court can establish a person's identity, regardless of consent or cooperation, the court will engage in proceedings and sanctions against the individual. This is due to the legal principle known as ''[[Idem sonans]]'' (Latin for \"sounding the same\") which states that similar sounding names are just as valid in referring to a person.{{R|\"Blacks_Idem\"}} The earliest legal precedent is ''R v Davis'' in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851.{{R|\"ARCHBOLD1867\"}}\n\n{{cquote|If two names spelt differently necessarily sound alike, the court may, as matter of law, pronounce them to be idem sonantia; but if they do not necessarily sound alike, the question whether they are idem sonantia is a question of fact for the jury.}}\n\n== Relevant cases ==\n{{dynamic list}}\n \n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Case\n!Defendant\n!Case notes\n!Court Ruling\n|-\n|''United States v.

It had to do so because it made those amounts immediately available to the Treasury, wherever desired. Since settlement by the local banks was in specie i.e. silver and gold coin, the pressure for settlement automatically regulated local banking lending: for the more the local banks lent the larger amount of their notes and checks in use and the larger the sums they had to settle in specie. This loss of specie reduced their power to lend.<ref>Hammond, 1956, pp. 9\u201310</ref>}} \n  \nUnder this banking regime, the impulse towards over speculation, with the risks of creating a national financial crisis, would be avoided, or at least mitigated.<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 149-150, Wilentz, 2008, p. 205, Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56</ref> It was just this mechanism that the local private banks found objectionable, because it yoked their lending strategies to the fiscal operations of the national government, requiring them to maintain adequate gold and silver reserves to meet their debt obligations to the U.S. Treasury.<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 150\"/> The proliferation of private-sector banking institutions \u2013 from 31 banks in 1801 to 788 in 1837<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 153</ref> \u2013 meant that the Second Bank faced strong opposition from this sector during the Jackson administration.<ref name=\"Wilentz, 2008, p. 205\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:United States Bank Philadelphia 1875.png|thumb|The building in a book published in 1875]]\nThe architect of the Second Bank of the United States was [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]] (1788\u20131854), a former student of [[Benjamin Latrobe]] (1764\u20131820), the man who is often called the first professionally trained American [[architect]]. Latrobe and Strickland were both disciples of the [[Greek Revival]] style. Strickland went on to design many other American public buildings in this style, including financial structures such as the [[Mechanics National Bank]] (also in Philadelphia). He also designed the [[New Orleans Mint|New Orleans]], [[Dahlonega Mint|Dahlonega]], and [[Charlotte Mint|Charlotte]] branch mints in the mid-to-late 1830s, as well as the second building for the main [[Philadelphia Mint|U.S. Mint in Philadelphia]] in 1833.\n\nStrickland's design for the Second Bank of the United States is in essence based on the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens, Greece]], and is a significant early and monumental example of Greek Revival architecture.<ref name=\"nhlnom\">{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|87001293}}|title=NHL nomination for Second Bank of the United States|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-03-26}}</ref> The hallmarks of the Greek Revival style can be seen immediately in the north and south fa\u00e7ades, which use a large set of steps leading up to the main level platform, known as the [[stylobate]]. On top of these, Strickland placed eight severe [[Doric order|Doric]] columns, which are crowned by an entablature containing a [[triglyph]] [[frieze]] and simple triangular [[pediment]]. The building appears much as an ancient Greek temple, hence the stylistic name. The interior consists of an entrance hallway in the center of the north fa\u00e7ade flanked by two rooms on either side. The entry leads into two central rooms, one after the other, that span the width of the structure east to west. The east and west sides of the first large room are each pierced by large arched fan window. The building's exterior uses Pennsylvania blue marble, which, due to the manner in which it was cut, has begun to deteriorate due to weak parts of the stone being exposed to the elements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania Blue Marble|work=Second Bank of the United States|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.design.upenn.edu/hspv/second_bank/conservation/bluemarble.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604135141/http://www.design.upenn.edu/hspv/second_bank/conservation/bluemarble.htm|archivedate=2009-06-04}}</ref> This phenomenon is most visible on the Doric columns of the south fa\u00e7ade.  Construction lasted from 1819 to 1824.\n\nThe Greek Revival style used for the Second Bank contrasts with the earlier, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in architecture used for the [[First Bank of the United States]], which also still stands and is located nearby in Philadelphia. This can be seen in the more Roman-influenced Federal structure's ornate, colossal Corinthian columns of its fa\u00e7ade, which is also embellished by Corinthian pilasters and a symmetric arrangement of sash windows piercing the two stories of the fa\u00e7ade. The roofline is also topped by a balustrade and the heavy modillions adorning the pediment give the First Bank an appearance much more like a Roman villa than a Greek temple.\n\n===Current building use===\nSince the bank's closing in 1841, the edifice has performed a variety of functions.

Whereas other central banks of that era were wholly private, the BUS was more characteristic of a government bank.<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 140</ref>\n\nUnder its charter, the bank had a capital limit of $35&nbsp;million, $7.5&nbsp;million of which represented the government-owned share. The central bank was required to remit a \"bonus\" payment of $1.5 million, payable in three installments,<ref name=\"Dangerfield, 1966, p. 12\"/> to the government for the privilege of using the public funds, interest free, in its private banking ventures.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 364</ref> The institution was answerable for its performance to the U.S. Treasury and Congress<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 149\">Hammond, 1947, p. 149</ref> and subject to Treasury Department inspection.<ref name=\"Dangerfield, 1966, p. 12\"/>\n\nAs exclusive fiscal agent for the federal government,<ref>Wellman, 1966, p. 92, Hammond, 1947, p. 149</ref> it provided a number of services as part of its charter including: holding and transfer of all U.S. deposits, payment and receipt of all government transactions, and processing of tax payments.<ref>Wilentz, 2005, p. 365</ref> In other words, the BUS was \"the depository of the federal government, which was its principal stockholder and customer\".<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 149, Hammond, 1957, p. 9</ref>\n\nThe chief personnel for the bank comprised twenty-five directors, five of whom were appointed by the President of the United States, subject to Senate approval.<ref name=\"Dangerfield, 1966, p. 12\"/> Federally appointed directors were barred from acting as officials in other banks. Two of the three BUS presidents, William Jones and Nicholas Biddle, were chosen from among these government directors.<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 149\"/>\n\nHeadquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the bank was authorized to establish branch offices where it deemed suitable and these were [[McCulloch v. Maryland|immune from state taxation]].<ref name=\"Dangerfield, 1966, p. 12\"/>\n\n==BUS regulatory mechanisms==\n\nThe primary regulatory task of the Second Bank of the United States, as chartered by Congress in 1816, was to restrain the uninhibited proliferation of paper money (bank notes) by state or private lenders,<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 150\"/> which was highly profitable to these institutions.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, pp. 74\u201375</ref> \n  \nIn this capacity, the bank would preside over this democratization of credit,<ref name=\"Wilentz, 2008, p. 205\"/><ref name=\"Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56\">Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56</ref> contributing to a vast and profitable disbursement of bank loans to farmers, small manufacturers and entrepreneurs, encouraging rapid and healthy economic expansion.<ref name=\"Wilentz, 2008, p. 205\"/> \n  \nHistorian Bray Hammond describes the mechanism by which the Bank exerted its anti-inflationary influence: \n  \n{{Quote|Receiving the checks and notes of local banks deposited with the [BUS] by government collectors of revenue, the [BUS] had constantly to come back on the local banks for settlements of the amounts which the checks and notes called for. It had to do so because it made those amounts immediately available to the Treasury, wherever desired. Since settlement by the local banks was in specie i.e. silver and gold coin, the pressure for settlement automatically regulated local banking lending: for the more the local banks lent the larger amount of their notes and checks in use and the larger the sums they had to settle in specie. This loss of specie reduced their power to lend.<ref>Hammond, 1956, pp. 9\u201310</ref>}} \n  \nUnder this banking regime, the impulse towards over speculation, with the risks of creating a national financial crisis, would be avoided, or at least mitigated.<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 149-150, Wilentz, 2008, p. 205, Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56</ref> It was just this mechanism that the local private banks found objectionable, because it yoked their lending strategies to the fiscal operations of the national government, requiring them to maintain adequate gold and silver reserves to meet their debt obligations to the U.S. Treasury.<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 150\"/> The proliferation of private-sector banking institutions \u2013 from 31 banks in 1801 to 788 in 1837<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 153</ref> \u2013 meant that the Second Bank faced strong opposition from this sector during the Jackson administration.<ref name=\"Wilentz, 2008, p. 205\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:United States Bank Philadelphia 1875.png|thumb|The building in a book published in 1875]]\nThe architect of the Second Bank of the United States was [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]] (1788\u20131854), a former student of [[Benjamin Latrobe]] (1764\u20131820), the man who is often called the first professionally trained American [[architect]]. Latrobe and Strickland were both disciples of the [[Greek Revival]] style. Strickland went on to design many other American public buildings in this style, including financial structures such as the [[Mechanics National Bank]] (also in Philadelphia). He also designed the [[New Orleans Mint|New Orleans]], [[Dahlonega Mint|Dahlonega]], and [[Charlotte Mint|Charlotte]] branch mints in the mid-to-late 1830s, as well as the second building for the main [[Philadelphia Mint|U.S. Mint in Philadelphia]] in 1833.\n\nStrickland's design for the Second Bank of the United States is in essence based on the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens, Greece]], and is a significant early and monumental example of Greek Revival architecture.<ref name=\"nhlnom\">{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|87001293}}|title=NHL nomination for Second Bank of the United States|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-03-26}}</ref> The hallmarks of the Greek Revival style can be seen immediately in the north and south fa\u00e7ades, which use a large set of steps leading up to the main level platform, known as the [[stylobate]]. On top of these, Strickland placed eight severe [[Doric order|Doric]] columns, which are crowned by an entablature containing a [[triglyph]] [[frieze]] and simple triangular [[pediment]]. The building appears much as an ancient Greek temple, hence the stylistic name. The interior consists of an entrance hallway in the center of the north fa\u00e7ade flanked by two rooms on either side. The entry leads into two central rooms, one after the other, that span the width of the structure east to west. The east and west sides of the first large room are each pierced by large arched fan window. The building's exterior uses Pennsylvania blue marble, which, due to the manner in which it was cut, has begun to deteriorate due to weak parts of the stone being exposed to the elements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania Blue Marble|work=Second Bank of the United States|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.design.upenn.edu/hspv/second_bank/conservation/bluemarble.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604135141/http://www.design.upenn.edu/hspv/second_bank/conservation/bluemarble.htm|archivedate=2009-06-04}}</ref> This phenomenon is most visible on the Doric columns of the south fa\u00e7ade.  Construction lasted from 1819 to 1824.\n\nThe Greek Revival style used for the Second Bank contrasts with the earlier, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in architecture used for the [[First Bank of the United States]], which also still stands and is located nearby in Philadelphia. This can be seen in the more Roman-influenced Federal structure's ornate, colossal Corinthian columns of its fa\u00e7ade, which is also embellished by Corinthian pilasters and a symmetric arrangement of sash windows piercing the two stories of the fa\u00e7ade. The roofline is also topped by a balustrade and the heavy modillions adorning the pediment give the First Bank an appearance much more like a Roman villa than a Greek temple.\n\n===Current building use===\nSince the bank's closing in 1841, the edifice has performed a variety of functions. Today, it is part of [[Independence National Historical Park]] in Philadelphia.\nThe structure is open to the public free of charge and serves as an art gallery, housing a large collection of portraits of prominent early Americans painted by [[Charles Willson Peale]] and many others.\n\nThe building was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1987 for its architectural and historic significance.<ref name=\"nhlnom\"/>\n\nThe Wall Street branch in New York City was converted into the United States Assay Office before it was demolished in 1915. The federal-style fa\u00e7ade was saved and installed in the American Wing of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1924.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Banks|Philadelphia}}\n* [[Banking in the Jacksonian Era]]\n* [[Federal Reserve Act]]\n* [[Federal Reserve System]]\n* [[First Bank of the United States]]\n* [[History of central banking in the United States]]\n* ''[[McCulloch v.
