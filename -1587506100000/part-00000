(2003). Subcategorization and Selection. In International Encyclopedia of Linguistics. : Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2 Apr. 2020</ref> Violating the requirements of subcategorization and selection will produce an ill-formed sentence. <blockquote>\"They put the papers {under the desk/*to the desk/*the desk/*tidy}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003)</blockquote>Keeping in mind that an asterisk (*) is used to indicate ungrammaticality, this example shows that out of the options given, only \"under the desk\" leads to the production of a well-formed sentence. The term selection is commonly used alongside subcategorization, but the two encode two different types of information.<ref name=\":0\" /> Selection is used to represent the semantic requirements placed on arguments and subcategorization is used to represent the syntactic requirements placed on complements.<blockquote>\"They tried to kill the {president/person/weeds/*box}.\n\nThey tried to murder the {president/person/*weeds/*box}.\n\nThey tried to assassinate the {president/*person/*weeds/*box}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003)</blockquote>Here we see that the object of the verb \"kill\" can be any living thing, that of \"murder\" must be human, and that of \"assassinate\" must be a famous human.\n\n==Lexical Entries==\nA lexical entry indicates crucial syntactic information about the heard of a phrase, such as what it selects and where it must be positioned. The term lexical entries come from the idea of the \"mental lexicon\", which specifies what speakers know about individual lexical items (Kroger, 2005). We can think of a lexical entry analogously to a dictionary entry. Each lexical item (LI) is associated with a lexical entry, minimally a triplet of features: Phonological, Formal, and Semantic, if not also other grammatical information such as irregular forms or patterns associated with that specific word (Kroger, 2005). Phonological features indicate pronunciation information and whether the LI is free or bound. Formal features indicate syntactic category labels, otherwise known as parts of speech. Finally, semantic features indicate meaning. In accordance with X-Bar Theory and the Projection Principle, all of these features must be satisfied by each head in order to create a well formed sentence. For example, a partial lexical entry for the English noun ''dog'' has been illustrated below (Kroger, 2005). \n\n\n''dog'' /d\u00f4g/<br>\n\n'a domesticated carnivorous mammal, typically found with four legs\"<br>\n\n<sub>CAT</sub>: N<br>\n\n[+count]<br>\n\n<sub>PLURAL</sub>: ''dogs''\n\n\n\n===Argument Structure===\nArgument structure is the list of selected arguments associated with a lexical category, such as a verb (SKS, 2015). When every predicate, otherwise known as a verb, is used, it selects a specific set of arguments that need to be fulfilled to create a well-formed sentence (Kroger, 2005). These are arguments such as <small>AGENT</small>, <small>PATIENT</small>, <small>EXPERIENCER</small>, <small>THEME</small>, <small>RECIPIENT</small>, and <small>STIMULUS</small>. To illustrate this, the sentence ''The adults asked if the cats would pee on the sofa'', has been broken down into its semantic roles and argument selections below. \n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! Category (Head) !! Selection Restriction: Argument Selection\n|-\n| ''ask'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<small>THEME</small>}\n|-\n| ''pee'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<sub>THEME</sub>}\n|-\n| ''adults'' || N || \n|-\n| ''cats'' || N || \n|-\n| ''sofa'' || N || {(PP<sub>THEME</sub>)}\n|}\n\n\nIt is necessary to understand the fundamentals of argument structure to understand the idea of subcategorization because subcategorization, as noted above, refers to the sub-categories a verb (or other semantic role) requires (Kroger, 2005). For example, the verb ''ask'' from above subcategorizes for a DP<small>AGENT</small> and CP<small>THEME</small>, otherwise known as a subject and direct object, respectively. In this way, subcategorization is an important piece of information to include in any lexical entry.\n\n===Thematic Roles and S-Selection===\n''Theta roles'' identify the meaning relation between the constituent and the selected predicate (SKS 2015). There are eight theta roles: <small>AGENT</small>, <small>THEME</small>, <small>CAUSE</small>, <small>POSSESSOR</small>, <small>LOCATION</small>,<small>GOAL</small>, <small>EXPERIENCER</small>, and <small>BENEFICIARY</small>. Each term indicates the relationship between the verb, predicate, and one of its arguments. This is what is called ''s-selection'', a shortening of semantic selection. S-Selection is an important addition to any lexical entry in order to make them easier to interpret (SKS 2015). It is important to understand that, according to the ''Theta Criterion'', every argument bears one and only one theta role (Chomsky, 1981). Below is an example for each theta role (SKS 2015):\n\n<small>CAUSE</small>: a cause; ''The dog bit the child. This made him cry''\n\n\n<small>AGENT</small>: a person on entity which intentionally is causing or doing something; ''Joshua intentionally hit him''\n\n\n<small>EXPERIENCER</small>: a sentient being inside of, or acquiring, a psychological state; ''Sam hates cats/Josh noticed Alice''\n\n\n<small>LOCATION</small>: a location; ''Marianne leaped through the field''\n\n\n<small>GOAL</small>: a location/being that is the endpoint; ''Moses gave Josh a toothbrush''\n\n\n<small>BENEFICIARY</small>: a beneficiary; ''Susie made cookies for Sarah''\n\n\n<small>POSSESSOR</small>: a possessor; ''Shelly owns cats''\n\n\n<small>POSSESSEE/POSSESSED</small>: what is possessed; ''Shelly's cats''\n*<small>POSSESSEE/POSSESSED</small> is a subset of <small>POSSESSOR</small> which is why it has been included but not given its own role\n\n\n<small>THEME</small>: something that undergoes a change, such as location change, or any kind of progression;''Josie sent Riven cookies/''\n*<small>THEME</small> is also commonly used for things that do not fit any other theta role, such as ''Josie is short'' or ''Sarah said that it is foggy''\n==Verbs==\nWhile subcategorization is a concept that can apply to almost any type of lexical item, it is usually discussed with respect to verbs. Verbs that take just one argument are classified as intransitive, while verbs with two and three arguments are classified as transitive and ditransitive, respectively.<ref>See Tallerman (2011:39-41) for a discussion of subcategorization in terms of intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs.</ref> The following sentences are employed to illustrate the concept of subcategorization:\n\n::Luke worked.\n::Indiana Jones ate chilled monkey brain.\n::Tom waited for us.\n\nThe verb ''worked/work'' is intransitive and thus subcategorizes for a single argument (here ''Luke''), which is the subject; therefore its subcategorization frame contains just a subject argument. The verb ''ate/eat'' is transitive, so it subcategorizes for two arguments (here ''Indiana Jones'' and ''chilled monkey brain''), a subject and an optional object, which means that its subcategorization frame contains two arguments. And the verb ''waited/wait'' subcategorizes for two arguments as well, although the second of these is an optional prepositional argument associated with the preposition ''for''. In this regard, we see that the subcategorization frame of verbs can contain specific words. Subcategorization frames are sometimes schematized in the following manner:\n\n::work [NP __ ]\n::eat [NP __ (NP)]\n::wait [NP __ (''for'' NP)]\n\nThese examples demonstrate that subcategorization frames are specifications of the number and types of arguments of a word (usually a verb), and they are believed to be listed as [[lexicon|lexical]] information (that is, they are thought of as part of a speaker's knowledge of the word in the vocabulary of the language). Dozens of distinct subcategorization frames are needed to accommodate the full combinatory potential of the verbs of any given language. Finally, subcategorization frames are associated most closely with verbs, although the concept can also be applied to other word categories.\n\nSubcategorization frames are essential parts of a number of [[phrase structure grammar]]s, e.g. [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], and [[Minimalism (linguistics)|Minimalism]].\n\n==Occurrences==\nSubcategorization can be observed in any language, including but not limited to:\nFrench\nGerman\nMandarin \n==Valency==\nThe subcategorization notion is similar to the notion of [[valency (linguistics)|valency]], although subcategorization originates with [[phrase structure grammar]]s in the [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] tradition,<ref>See Chomsky (1965).</ref> whereas valency originates with [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] of the [[dependency grammar]] tradition.<ref>See Tesni\u00e8re (1959).</ref> The primary difference between the two concepts concerns the status of the subject. As it was originally conceived of, subcategorization did not include the subject, that is, a verb subcategorized for its [[complement (linguistics)|complement]](s) (=object and oblique arguments) but not for its subject.<ref>For examples of theories that exclude the subject from subcategorization frames, see Burton-Roberts (1886:73ff.), Horrocks (1986:34f.), Haegeman (1994:40-42, 45 note 10), Bennet (1995:43ff.), Green and Morgan (1996:68 note 6), Fromkin et al. (2000:230).</ref> Many modern theories now include the subject in the subcategorization frame, however.<ref>For examples of theories that include the subject in the subcategorization frame, see Kaplan and Bresnan (1982:210-212), Cattell (198428ff.), Pollard and Sag (1994:23), Culicover (1997:17), Carnie (2007:50ff.).</ref> Valency, in contrast, included the subject from the start.<ref>Tesni\u00e8re (1959/69:109, chapter 51, paragraph 13) emphasized that from a syntactic point of view, the subject is a complement just like the object.</ref> In this regard, subcategorization is moving in the direction of valency, since many phrase structure grammars now see verbs subcategorizing for their subject as well as for their object(s).\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Argument (linguistics)|Argument]]\n*[[Complement (linguistics)|Complement]]\n*[[Dependency grammar]]\n*[[Lexical item]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Transitivity (grammar)|Transitivity]]\n*[[Valency (linguistics)|Valency]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col}}\n* Bennet, P. 1995.

The tripartite motto was neither a creative collection, nor really institutionalized by the French Revolution.<ref name=Ozouf /> As soon as 1789, other terms were used, such as \"''la Nation, la Loi, le Roi''\" (The Nation, The Law, The King), or \"''Union, Force, Vertu''\" (Union, Strength, Virtue), a slogan used beforehand by [[Freemasonry|masonic lodges]], or \"''Force, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Justice''\" (Strength, Equality, Justice), \"''Libert\u00e9, S\u00fbret\u00e9, Propri\u00e9t\u00e9''\" (Liberty, Security, Property), etc.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nIn other words, ''libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9'' was only one slogan among many others.<ref name=Ozouf /> During the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] revolutionary period itself, various mottos were used, such as ''libert\u00e9, unit\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9'' (liberty, unity, equality); ''libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, justice'' (liberty, equality, justice); ''libert\u00e9, raison, \u00e9galit\u00e9'' (liberty, reason, equality), etc.<ref name=Ozouf /> The only solid association was that of ''libert\u00e9'' and ''\u00e9galit\u00e9'', ''fraternit\u00e9'' being ignored by the ''[[Cahiers de dol\u00e9ances]]'' as well as by the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. It was only alluded to in the 1791 [[French Constitution|Constitution]], as well as in [[Robespierre]]'s draft Declaration of 1793, placed under the invocation of (in that order) ''\u00e9galit\u00e9, libert\u00e9, s\u00fbret\u00e9'' and ''propri\u00e9t\u00e9'' (equality, liberty, safety, property\u2014though it was used not as a motto, but as articles of declaration), as the possibility of a universal extension of the Declaration of Rights: \"Men of all countries are brothers, he who oppresses one nation declares himself the enemy of all.\"<ref name=Ozouf />{{Efn |French: \"''Les hommes de tous les pays sont fr\u00e8res, celui qui opprime une seule nation se d\u00e9clare l'ennemi de toutes.''\"}} Finally, it did not figure in the August 1793 Declaration.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nThe [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789 defined liberty in Article 4 as follows:\n\n{{quote|Liberty consists of being able to do anything that does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of every man or woman has no bounds other than those that guarantee other members of society the enjoyment of these same rights.}}\n\nEquality, on the other hand, was defined by the 1789 Declaration in terms of judicial equality and merit-based entry to government (art. 6):\n\n{{quote|[The law] must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes.

The first one, according to Mona Ozouf, was one of \"''fraternit\u00e9 de r\u00e9bellion''\" (Fraternity of Rebellion),<ref name=Ozouf /> that is the union of the deputies in the ''[[Tennis Court Oath|Jeu de Paume Oath]]'' of June 1789, refusing the dissolution ordered by the King [[Louis XVI]]: \"We swear never to separate ourselves from the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the realm is drawn up and fixed upon solid foundations.\" Fraternity was thus issued from Liberty and oriented by a common cause.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nAnother form of ''fraternit\u00e9'' was that of the patriotic Church, which identified social link with religious link and based fraternity on Christian brotherhood.<ref name=Ozouf /> In this second sense, ''fraternit\u00e9'' preceded both ''libert\u00e9'' and ''\u00e9galit\u00e9'', instead of following them as in the first sense.<ref name=Ozouf />{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} Thus, two senses of Fraternity: \"one, that followed liberty and equality, was the object of a free pact; the other preceded liberty and equality as the mark on its work of the divine craftsman.\"<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nAnother hesitation concerning the compatibility of the three terms arose from the opposition between liberty and equality as [[Individualism|individualistic]] values, and fraternity as the realization of a happy community, devoided of any conflicts and opposed to any form of [[egotism]].<ref name=Ozouf /> This fusional interpretation of Fraternity opposed it to the project of [[Self-ownership|individual autonomy]] and manifested the precedence of Fraternity on individual will.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nIn this sense, it was sometimes associated with death, as in ''Fraternit\u00e9, ou la Mort!'' (Fraternity or Death!), excluding liberty and even equality, by establishing a strong dichotomy between those who were brothers and those who were not (in the sense of \"[[You're either with us, or against us|you are with me or against me]]\", brother or foe).<ref name=Ozouf />{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} [[Louis de Saint-Just]] thus stigmatized [[Anarchasis Cloots]]' [[cosmopolitanism]], declaring \"Cloots liked the universe, except France.\"<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nWith [[Thermidorian Reaction|Thermidor]] and the execution of Robespierre, ''fraternit\u00e9'' disappeared from the slogan, reduced to the two terms of liberty and equality, re-defined again as simple judicial equality and not as the equality upheld by the sentiment of fraternity.<ref name=Ozouf/> The [[First Consul]] ([[Napoleon Bonaparte]]) then established the motto ''libert\u00e9, ordre public'' (liberty, public order).\n\n==19th century==\nFollowing Napoleon's rule, the triptych dissolved itself, as none believed possible to conciliate individual liberty and equality of rights with [[Equality of outcome|equality of results]] and fraternity.<ref name=Ozouf /> The idea of [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]] and of [[natural rights]] possessed by man before being united in the collectivity contradicted the possibility of establishing a transparent and fraternal community.<ref name=Ozouf /> [[Liberalism|Liberals]] accepted liberty and equality, defining the latter as equality of rights and ignoring fraternity.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\n[[Utopian socialism|Early socialists]] rejected an independent conception of liberty, opposed to the social, and also despised equality, as they considered, as [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]], that one had only to orchestrate individual discordances, to harmonize them, or they believed, as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], that equality contradicted [[Equity (economics)|equity]] by a brutal levelling of individualities.<ref name=Ozouf /> Utopian socialism thus only valued fraternity, which was, in [[Etienne Cabet|Cabet]]'s [[Icarians|Icarie]] the sole commandment.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nThis opposition between liberals and socialists was mirrored in rival historical interpretations of the Revolution, liberals admiring 1789, and socialists 1793.<ref name=Ozouf /> The [[July Revolution]] of 1830, establishing a constitutional monarchy headed by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], substituted ''ordre et libert\u00e9'' (order and liberty) to the Napoleonic motto ''Libert\u00e9, Ordre public''.<ref name=Ozouf /> Despite this apparent disappearance of the triptych, the latter was still being thought in some underground circles, in Republican [[secret societies]], masonic lodges such as the \"Indivisible Trinity,\" far-left booklets or during the [[Canuts Revolt]] in Lyon.<ref name=Ozouf /> In 1834, the lawyer of the [[Society of the Rights of Man]] (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des droits de l'homme), [[Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure|Dupont]], a liberal sitting in the far-left during the [[July Monarchy]], associated the three terms together in the ''[[Revue R\u00e9publicaine]]'' which he edited:\n\n{{quote|Any man aspires to liberty, to equality, but he can not achieve it without the assistance of other men, without fraternity<ref name=Ozouf />{{Efn |French: \"''Tout homme aspire \u00e0 la libert\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, mais on ne peut y atteindre sans le secours des autres hommes, sans la fraternit\u00e9.''\"}}}}\n\nThe triptych resurfaced during the 1847 ''[[Campagne des Banquets]]'', upheld for example in [[Lille]] by [[Ledru-Rollin]].<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nTwo interpretations had attempted to conciliate the three terms, beyond the antagonism between liberals and socialists. One was upheld by Catholic traditionalists, such as [[Chateaubriand]] or [[Ballanche]], the other by socialist and republicans such as [[Pierre Leroux]].<ref name=Ozouf /> Chateaubriand thus gave a Christian interpretation of the revolutionary motto, stating in the 1841 conclusion to his ''M\u00e9moires d'outre-tombe'':\n\n{{quote|Far from being at its term, the religion of the Liberator is now only just entering its third phase, the political period, liberty, equality, fraternity<ref name=Ozouf />{{Efn |French: \"''Loin d'\u00eatre \u00e0 son terme, la religion du Lib\u00e9rateur entre \u00e0 peine dans sa troisi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode, la p\u00e9riode politique, libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9.''\"}}}}\n\nNeither Chateaubriand nor Ballanche considered the three terms to be antagonistic. Rather, they took them for being the achievement of Christianity. On the other hand, Pierre Leroux did not disguise the difficulties of associating the three terms, but superated it by considering liberty as the aim, equality as the principle and fraternity as the means.<ref name=Ozouf /> Leroux thus ordered the motto as Liberty, Fraternity, Equality,<ref name=Ozouf /> an order also supported by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialists]], such as [[Buchez]].<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nAgainst this new order of the triptych, [[Jules Michelet|Michelet]] supported the traditional order, maintaining the primordial importance of an original individualistic right.<ref name=Ozouf /> Michelet attempted to conciliate a rational communication with a fraternal communication, \"right beyond right\",<ref name=Ozouf />{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} and thus the rival traditions of socialism and liberalism.<ref name=Ozouf /> The [[republicanism|republican]] tradition would strongly inspire itself from Michelet's synchretism.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\n===1848 Revolution===\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|header=''Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9'' on French coins\n|image1=France 5 francs 1849.jpg\n|caption1=5-franc piece, 1849\n|image2=\n|caption2=1-franc piece, 1899\n|image3=France 20 francs 1851.jpg|\n|caption3=20-franc piece, 1851\n}}\nWith the [[1848 February Revolution]], the motto was officially adopted,<ref name=\"Frenchsymbols\">{{cite web |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france_159/discovering-france_2005/france-from-to-z_1978/the-symbols-of-the-republic-and-bastille-day_2002/ |title=The symbols of the Republic and Bastille Day |accessdate=20 April 2006}}</ref> mainly under the pressure of the people who had attempted to impose the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] over the [[Flag of France|tricolor flag]] (the 1791 red flag was, however, the symbol of martial law and of order, not of insurrection).<ref name=Ozouf /> [[Lamartine]] opposed popular aspirations, and in exchange of the maintaining of the tricolor flag, conceded the Republican motto of ''Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9'', written on the flag, on which a red rosette was also to be added.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nFraternity was then considered to resume and to contain both Liberty and Equality, being a form of civil religion (which, far from opposing itself to Christianity, was associated with it in 1848<ref name=Ozouf />{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}) establishing social link (as called for by Rousseau in the conclusion of the ''Social Contract'').<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nHowever, Fraternity was not devoid of its previous sense of opposition between brothers and foes, images of blood haunting revolutionary Christian publications, taking in [[Lamennais]]' themes.<ref name=Ozouf /> Thus, the newspaper ''[[Le Christ r\u00e9publicain]]'' (The Republican Christ) developed the idea of the Christ bringing forth peace to the poor and war to the rich.<ref name=Ozouf /><ref>''Le Christ r\u00e9publicain'' n\u00b07, quoted by Mona Ozouf: \"''Nous, pauvres prol\u00e9taires, nous sommes rouges, parce que le Christ a vers\u00e9 son sang pour nous racheter, son sang par lequel nous voulons nous r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rer.

The tripartite motto was neither a creative collection, nor really institutionalized by the French Revolution.<ref name=Ozouf /> As soon as 1789, other terms were used, such as \"''la Nation, la Loi, le Roi''\" (The Nation, The Law, The King), or \"''Union, Force, Vertu''\" (Union, Strength, Virtue), a slogan used beforehand by [[Freemasonry|masonic lodges]], or \"''Force, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Justice''\" (Strength, Equality, Justice), \"''Libert\u00e9, S\u00fbret\u00e9, Propri\u00e9t\u00e9''\" (Liberty, Security, Property), etc.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nIn other words, ''libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9'' was only one slogan among many others.<ref name=Ozouf /> During the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] revolutionary period itself, various mottos were used, such as ''libert\u00e9, unit\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9'' (liberty, unity, equality); ''libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, justice'' (liberty, equality, justice); ''libert\u00e9, raison, \u00e9galit\u00e9'' (liberty, reason, equality), etc.<ref name=Ozouf /> The only solid association was that of ''libert\u00e9'' and ''\u00e9galit\u00e9'', ''fraternit\u00e9'' being ignored by the ''[[Cahiers de dol\u00e9ances]]'' as well as by the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. It was only alluded to in the 1791 [[French Constitution|Constitution]], as well as in [[Robespierre]]'s draft Declaration of 1793, placed under the invocation of (in that order) ''\u00e9galit\u00e9, libert\u00e9, s\u00fbret\u00e9'' and ''propri\u00e9t\u00e9'' (equality, liberty, safety, property\u2014though it was used not as a motto, but as articles of declaration), as the possibility of a universal extension of the Declaration of Rights: \"Men of all countries are brothers, he who oppresses one nation declares himself the enemy of all.\"<ref name=Ozouf />{{Efn |French: \"''Les hommes de tous les pays sont fr\u00e8res, celui qui opprime une seule nation se d\u00e9clare l'ennemi de toutes.''\"}} Finally, it did not figure in the August 1793 Declaration.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nThe [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789 defined liberty in Article 4 as follows:\n\n{{quote|Liberty consists of being able to do anything that does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of every man or woman has no bounds other than those that guarantee other members of society the enjoyment of these same rights.}}\n\nEquality, on the other hand, was defined by the 1789 Declaration in terms of judicial equality and merit-based entry to government (art. 6):\n\n{{quote|[The law] must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in its eyes, shall be equally eligible to all high offices, public positions and employments, according to their ability, and without other distinction than that of their virtues and talents.}}\n\n''Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9'' actually finds its origins in a May 1791 proposition by the ''[[Cordeliers|Club des Cordeliers]]'', following a speech on the Army by the [[marquis de Guichardin]].<ref name=Ozouf /> A British marine held prisoner on the French ship ''Le Marat'' in 1794 wrote home in letters published in 1796:<ref>{{Citation |title=Letters Written in France: To a Friend in London, Between the Month of November 1794, and the Month of May 1795 |first=Watkin |last=Tench |place=London |publisher=J Johnson |year=1796 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ztMuAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA15 |page=15}}.</ref>\n\n{{quote|The republican spirit is inculcated not in songs only, for in every part of the ship I find emblems purposely displayed to awaken it.

The first one, according to Mona Ozouf, was one of \"''fraternit\u00e9 de r\u00e9bellion''\" (Fraternity of Rebellion),<ref name=Ozouf /> that is the union of the deputies in the ''[[Tennis Court Oath|Jeu de Paume Oath]]'' of June 1789, refusing the dissolution ordered by the King [[Louis XVI]]: \"We swear never to separate ourselves from the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the realm is drawn up and fixed upon solid foundations.\" Fraternity was thus issued from Liberty and oriented by a common cause.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nAnother form of ''fraternit\u00e9'' was that of the patriotic Church, which identified social link with religious link and based fraternity on Christian brotherhood.<ref name=Ozouf /> In this second sense, ''fraternit\u00e9'' preceded both ''libert\u00e9'' and ''\u00e9galit\u00e9'', instead of following them as in the first sense.<ref name=Ozouf />{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} Thus, two senses of Fraternity: \"one, that followed liberty and equality, was the object of a free pact; the other preceded liberty and equality as the mark on its work of the divine craftsman.\"<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nAnother hesitation concerning the compatibility of the three terms arose from the opposition between liberty and equality as [[Individualism|individualistic]] values, and fraternity as the realization of a happy community, devoided of any conflicts and opposed to any form of [[egotism]].<ref name=Ozouf /> This fusional interpretation of Fraternity opposed it to the project of [[Self-ownership|individual autonomy]] and manifested the precedence of Fraternity on individual will.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nIn this sense, it was sometimes associated with death, as in ''Fraternit\u00e9, ou la Mort!'' (Fraternity or Death!), excluding liberty and even equality, by establishing a strong dichotomy between those who were brothers and those who were not (in the sense of \"[[You're either with us, or against us|you are with me or against me]]\", brother or foe).<ref name=Ozouf />{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} [[Louis de Saint-Just]] thus stigmatized [[Anarchasis Cloots]]' [[cosmopolitanism]], declaring \"Cloots liked the universe, except France.\"<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nWith [[Thermidorian Reaction|Thermidor]] and the execution of Robespierre, ''fraternit\u00e9'' disappeared from the slogan, reduced to the two terms of liberty and equality, re-defined again as simple judicial equality and not as the equality upheld by the sentiment of fraternity.<ref name=Ozouf/> The [[First Consul]] ([[Napoleon Bonaparte]]) then established the motto ''libert\u00e9, ordre public'' (liberty, public order).\n\n==19th century==\nFollowing Napoleon's rule, the triptych dissolved itself, as none believed possible to conciliate individual liberty and equality of rights with [[Equality of outcome|equality of results]] and fraternity.<ref name=Ozouf /> The idea of [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]] and of [[natural rights]] possessed by man before being united in the collectivity contradicted the possibility of establishing a transparent and fraternal community.<ref name=Ozouf /> [[Liberalism|Liberals]] accepted liberty and equality, defining the latter as equality of rights and ignoring fraternity.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\n[[Utopian socialism|Early socialists]] rejected an independent conception of liberty, opposed to the social, and also despised equality, as they considered, as [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]], that one had only to orchestrate individual discordances, to harmonize them, or they believed, as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], that equality contradicted [[Equity (economics)|equity]] by a brutal levelling of individualities.<ref name=Ozouf /> Utopian socialism thus only valued fraternity, which was, in [[Etienne Cabet|Cabet]]'s [[Icarians|Icarie]] the sole commandment.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nThis opposition between liberals and socialists was mirrored in rival historical interpretations of the Revolution, liberals admiring 1789, and socialists 1793.<ref name=Ozouf /> The [[July Revolution]] of 1830, establishing a constitutional monarchy headed by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], substituted ''ordre et libert\u00e9'' (order and liberty) to the Napoleonic motto ''Libert\u00e9, Ordre public''.<ref name=Ozouf /> Despite this apparent disappearance of the triptych, the latter was still being thought in some underground circles, in Republican [[secret societies]], masonic lodges such as the \"Indivisible Trinity,\" far-left booklets or during the [[Canuts Revolt]] in Lyon.<ref name=Ozouf /> In 1834, the lawyer of the [[Society of the Rights of Man]] (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des droits de l'homme), [[Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure|Dupont]], a liberal sitting in the far-left during the [[July Monarchy]], associated the three terms together in the ''[[Revue R\u00e9publicaine]]'' which he edited:\n\n{{quote|Any man aspires to liberty, to equality, but he can not achieve it without the assistance of other men, without fraternity<ref name=Ozouf />{{Efn |French: \"''Tout homme aspire \u00e0 la libert\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, mais on ne peut y atteindre sans le secours des autres hommes, sans la fraternit\u00e9.''\"}}}}\n\nThe triptych resurfaced during the 1847 ''[[Campagne des Banquets]]'', upheld for example in [[Lille]] by [[Ledru-Rollin]].<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nTwo interpretations had attempted to conciliate the three terms, beyond the antagonism between liberals and socialists. One was upheld by Catholic traditionalists, such as [[Chateaubriand]] or [[Ballanche]], the other by socialist and republicans such as [[Pierre Leroux]].<ref name=Ozouf /> Chateaubriand thus gave a Christian interpretation of the revolutionary motto, stating in the 1841 conclusion to his ''M\u00e9moires d'outre-tombe'':\n\n{{quote|Far from being at its term, the religion of the Liberator is now only just entering its third phase, the political period, liberty, equality, fraternity<ref name=Ozouf />{{Efn |French: \"''Loin d'\u00eatre \u00e0 son terme, la religion du Lib\u00e9rateur entre \u00e0 peine dans sa troisi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode, la p\u00e9riode politique, libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9.''\"}}}}\n\nNeither Chateaubriand nor Ballanche considered the three terms to be antagonistic. Rather, they took them for being the achievement of Christianity. On the other hand, Pierre Leroux did not disguise the difficulties of associating the three terms, but superated it by considering liberty as the aim, equality as the principle and fraternity as the means.<ref name=Ozouf /> Leroux thus ordered the motto as Liberty, Fraternity, Equality,<ref name=Ozouf /> an order also supported by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialists]], such as [[Buchez]].<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nAgainst this new order of the triptych, [[Jules Michelet|Michelet]] supported the traditional order, maintaining the primordial importance of an original individualistic right.<ref name=Ozouf /> Michelet attempted to conciliate a rational communication with a fraternal communication, \"right beyond right\",<ref name=Ozouf />{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} and thus the rival traditions of socialism and liberalism.<ref name=Ozouf /> The [[republicanism|republican]] tradition would strongly inspire itself from Michelet's synchretism.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\n===1848 Revolution===\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|header=''Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9'' on French coins\n|image1=France 5 francs 1849.jpg\n|caption1=5-franc piece, 1849\n|image2=\n|caption2=1-franc piece, 1899\n|image3=France 20 francs 1851.jpg|\n|caption3=20-franc piece, 1851\n}}\nWith the [[1848 February Revolution]], the motto was officially adopted,<ref name=\"Frenchsymbols\">{{cite web |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france_159/discovering-france_2005/france-from-to-z_1978/the-symbols-of-the-republic-and-bastille-day_2002/ |title=The symbols of the Republic and Bastille Day |accessdate=20 April 2006}}</ref> mainly under the pressure of the people who had attempted to impose the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] over the [[Flag of France|tricolor flag]] (the 1791 red flag was, however, the symbol of martial law and of order, not of insurrection).<ref name=Ozouf /> [[Lamartine]] opposed popular aspirations, and in exchange of the maintaining of the tricolor flag, conceded the Republican motto of ''Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9'', written on the flag, on which a red rosette was also to be added.<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nFraternity was then considered to resume and to contain both Liberty and Equality, being a form of civil religion (which, far from opposing itself to Christianity, was associated with it in 1848<ref name=Ozouf />{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}) establishing social link (as called for by Rousseau in the conclusion of the ''Social Contract'').<ref name=Ozouf />\n\nHowever, Fraternity was not devoid of its previous sense of opposition between brothers and foes, images of blood haunting revolutionary Christian publications, taking in [[Lamennais]]' themes.<ref name=Ozouf /> Thus, the newspaper ''[[Le Christ r\u00e9publicain]]'' (The Republican Christ) developed the idea of the Christ bringing forth peace to the poor and war to the rich.<ref name=Ozouf /><ref>''Le Christ r\u00e9publicain'' n\u00b07, quoted by Mona Ozouf: \"''Nous, pauvres prol\u00e9taires, nous sommes rouges, parce que le Christ a vers\u00e9 son sang pour nous racheter, son sang par lequel nous voulons nous r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rer.

Because glass fiber itself is sometimes referred to as \"fiberglass\", the composite is also called \"fiberglass reinforced plastic\". This article will adopt the convention that \"fiberglass\" refers to the complete glass fiber reinforced composite material, rather than only to the glass fiber within it.\n\n== History ==\nGlass fibers have been produced for centuries, but the earliest patent was awarded to the Prussian inventor [[Hermann Hammesfahr]] (1845\u20131914) in the U.S. in 1880.<ref>Mitchell, Steve (November 1999). \"The birth of fiberglass boats,\" The Good Ole Boat.</ref><ref>\"Entry for US 232122 A (14-Sep-1880)\". US Patent Publication. Retrieved 9 October 2013.</ref>\n\n[[Mass production]] of glass strands was [[Serendipity|accidentally discovered]] in 1932 when [[Games Slayter]], a researcher at [[Owens-Illinois]], directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers. A patent for this method of producing glass wool was first applied for in 1933.<ref>Slayter, Games (11 November 1933) \"Method & Apparatus for Making Glass Wool\" {{US Patent|2133235}}</ref> Owens joined with the Corning company in 1935 and the method was adapted by [[Owens Corning]] to produce its patented \"Fiberglas\" (spelled with one \"s\") in 1936. Originally, Fiberglas was a [[glass wool]] with fibers entrapping a great deal of gas, making it useful as an insulator, especially at high temperatures.\n\nA suitable resin for combining the fiberglass with a plastic to produce a composite material was developed in 1936 by [[du Pont]]. The first ancestor of modern polyester resins is [[Cyanamid]]'s resin of 1942. [[Peroxide]] curing systems were used by then.<ref>{{cite web |last= Marsh |first= George |title= 50 years of reinforced plastic boats |work= reinforcedplastics|publisher= Elsevier Ltd |date= 8 Oct 2006 |url= http://www.reinforcedplastics.com/view/1461/50-years-of-reinforced-plastic-boats/ }}</ref> With the combination of fiberglass and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic. This reduced the insulation properties to values typical of the plastic, but now for the first time the composite showed great strength and promise as a structural and building material. Many glass fiber composites continued to be called \"fiberglass\" (as a generic name) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic.\n\nRay Greene of Owens Corning is credited with producing the first composite boat in 1937, but did not proceed further at the time due to the brittle nature of the plastic used. In 1939 Russia was reported to have constructed a passenger boat of plastic materials, and the United States a fuselage and wings of an aircraft.<ref>Notable Progress \u2013 the use of plastics, Evening Post, Wellington, New Zealand, Volume CXXVIII, Issue 31, 5 August 1939, Page 28</ref> The first car to have a fiber-glass body was a 1946 prototype of the [[Stout Scarab]], but the model did not enter production.<ref>{{cite news| last = Hobart| first = Tasmania| title = Car of the future in plastics| newspaper = The Mercury| pages = 16| date = 27 May 1946}}\n</ref>\n\n==Fiber==\n[[File:Glass reinforcements.jpg|thumb|Glass reinforcements used for fiberglass are supplied in different physical forms: microspheres, chopped or woven.]]\nUnlike glass fibers used for insulation, for the final structure to be strong, the fiber's surfaces must be almost entirely free of defects, as this permits the fibers to reach gigapascal [[tensile strength]]s. If a bulk piece of glass were defect-free, it would be equally as strong as glass fibers; however, it is generally impractical to produce and maintain bulk material in a defect-free state outside of laboratory conditions.<ref name=newscience>{{cite book |author=Gordon, J E |title=The New Science of Strong Materials: Or Why You Don't Fall Through the Floor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=axW-iYrhQ1YC|date=1991|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-192770-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Production ===\nThe process of manufacturing fiberglass is called [[pultrusion]]. The manufacturing process for glass fibers suitable for reinforcement uses large furnaces to gradually melt the [[silica]] sand, [[limestone]], [[kaolin clay]], [[fluorspar]], [[colemanite]], [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] and other [[minerals]] until a liquid forms. It is then extruded through bushings, which are bundles of very small orifices (typically 5\u201325 micrometres in diameter for E-Glass, 9 micrometres for S-Glass).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qZPBCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&dq=fiberglass+made+with+aluminosilicate+glass+fibers#v=onepage&q=fiberglass%20made%20with%20aluminosilicate%20glass%20fibers&f=false|title=Lightweight Ballistic Composites: Military and Law-Enforcement Applications|last=Bhatnagar|first=Ashok|date=2016-04-19|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|isbn=9780081004258|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThese filaments are then ''sized'' (coated) with a chemical solution. The individual filaments are now bundled in large numbers to provide a [[roving]]. The diameter of the filaments, and the number of filaments in the roving, determine its ''weight'', typically expressed in one of two measurement systems:\n*''yield'', or yards per pound (the number of yards of fiber in one pound of material; thus a smaller number means a heavier roving). Examples of standard yields are 225yield, 450yield, 675yield.\n*''tex'', or grams per km (how many grams 1&nbsp;km of roving weighs, inverted from yield; thus a smaller number means a lighter roving). Examples of standard tex are 750tex, 1100tex, 2200tex.\n\nThese rovings are then either used directly in a composite application such as [[pultrusion]], [[filament winding]] (pipe), gun roving (where an automated gun chops the glass into short lengths and drops it into a jet of resin, projected onto the surface of a mold), or in an intermediary step, to manufacture fabrics such as ''chopped strand mat'' (CSM) (made of randomly oriented small cut lengths of fiber all bonded together), woven fabrics, knit fabrics or uni-directional fabrics.\n\n====Chopped strand mat====\n'''Chopped strand mat''' or '''CSM''' is a form of reinforcement used in fiberglass. It consists of glass fibers laid randomly across each other and held together by a binder.\n\nIt is typically processed using the hand lay-up technique, where sheets of material are placed on a mold and brushed with resin. Because the binder dissolves in resin, the material easily conforms to different shapes when wetted out. After the resin cures, the hardened product can be taken from the mold and finished.\n\nUsing chopped strand mat gives the fiberglass [[isotropic]] in-plane material properties.\n\n===Sizing===\nA coating or primer is applied to the roving to:\n* help protect the glass filaments for processing and manipulation.\n* ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix, thus allowing for transfer of shear loads from the glass fibers to the thermoset plastic. Without this bonding, the fibers can 'slip' in the matrix, causing localized failure.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fundamentals: Repairing Fiberglass And Ensuring Bonding|author=Reese Gibson|url=http://www.reesesfishhunt.com/how-to-repair-small-hole-fiberglass-boat/ |accessdate=28 April 2017|date=2017-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nAn individual structural glass fiber is both stiff and strong in [[Tension (physics)|tension]] and [[compression (physical)|compression]]\u2014that is, ''along'' its axis. Although it might be assumed that the fiber is weak in compression, it is actually only the long [[aspect ratio]] of the fiber which makes it seem so; i.e., because a typical fiber is long and narrow, it buckles easily.<ref name=newscience/> On the other hand, the glass fiber is weak in shear\u2014that is, ''across'' its axis. Therefore, if a collection of fibers can be arranged permanently in a preferred direction within a material, and if they can be prevented from [[buckling]] in compression, the material will be preferentially strong in that direction.\n\nFurthermore, by laying multiple layers of fiber on top of one another, with each layer oriented in various preferred directions, the material's overall stiffness and strength can be efficiently controlled. In fiberglass, it is the plastic matrix which permanently constrains the structural glass fibers to directions chosen by the designer. With chopped strand mat, this directionality is essentially an entire two dimensional plane; with woven fabrics or unidirectional layers, directionality of stiffness and strength can be more precisely controlled within the plane.\n\nA fiberglass component is typically of a thin \"shell\" construction, sometimes filled on the inside with structural foam, as in the case of surfboards. The component may be of nearly arbitrary shape, limited only by the complexity and tolerances of the [[Molding (process)|mold]] used for manufacturing the shell.\n\nThe mechanical functionality of materials is heavily reliant on the combined performances of both the resin (AKA matrix) and fibers. For example, in severe temperature conditions (over 180&nbsp;\u00b0C), the resin component of the composite may lose its functionality, partially due to bond deterioration of resin and fiber.<ref name=CompositeConstruction>{{cite book |author=Bank, Lawrence C.|title=Composites for construction: structural design with FRP materials| url=http://au.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471681261.html| date=2006| publisher=John Wiley & Sons| isbn=978-0-471-68126-7}}</ref> However, GFRPs can still show  significant residual strength after experiencing high temperatures (200&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Russo |first1= Salvatore |first2= Behzad |last2= Ghadimi |first3= Krishna |last3= Lawania|first4= Michele |last4= Rosano|title= Residual strength testing in pultruded FRP material under a variety of temperature cycles and values |journal= Composite Structures |volume= 133 |pages= 458\u2013475 |date= December 2015 |url=   |doi=10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.07.034}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of glass fiber used ===\n{{main|Glass fiber}}\nComposition: the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is [[E-glass]], which is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other types of glass used are A-glass ('''A'''lkali-lime glass with little or no boron oxide), E-CR-glass ('''E'''lectrical/'''C'''hemical '''R'''esistance; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, with high acid resistance), C-glass (alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation), D-glass (borosilicate glass, named for its low '''D'''ielectric constant), R-glass (alumino silicate glass without MgO and CaO with high mechanical requirements as '''R'''einforcement), and S-glass (alumino silicate glass without CaO but with high MgO content with high tensile strength).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1= Fitzer |first1= Erich |title= Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |last2= Kleinholz |first2= Rudolf |last3= Tiesler |first3= Hartmut |last4= Stacey |first4= Martyn Hugh |last5= De Bruyne |first5= Roger |last6= Lefever |first6= Ignace |last7= Foley |first7= Andrew |last8= Frohs |first8= Wilhelm |last9= Hauke |first9= Tilo |last10= Heine |first10= Michael |last11= J\u00e4ger |first11= Hubert |last12= Sitter |first12= Sandra |display-authors= 3 |publisher= Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In order to lower the necessary work temperature, other materials are introduced as \"fluxing agents\" (i.e., components to lower the melting point). Ordinary A-glass (\"A\" for \"alkali-lime\") or soda lime glass, crushed and ready to be remelted, as so-called [[cullet]] glass, was the first type of glass used for fiberglass. E-glass (\"E\" because of initial Electrical application), is alkali free, and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation. It now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world, and also is the single largest consumer of [[boron]] minerals globally. It is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications. S-glass (\"S\" for \"stiff\") is used when tensile strength (high modulus) is important, and is thus an important building and aircraft epoxy composite (it is called R-glass, \"R\" for \"reinforcement\" in Europe). C-glass (\"C\" for \"chemical resistance\") and T-glass (\"T\" is for \"thermal insulator\"\u2014a North American variant of C-glass) are resistant to chemical attack; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass.<ref>{{cite web |title= Fiberglass |publisher= redOrbit.com |url= http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/general-2/inventions/2583670/fiberglass/ |accessdate= 28 Aug 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Table of some common fiberglass types ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was of particular interest to the aviation industry. A means of mass production of glass strands was accidentally discovered in 1932 when a researcher at [[Owens-Illinois]] directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers. After Owens merged with the Corning company in 1935, [[Owens Corning]] adapted the method to produce its patented \"Fiberglas\" (one \"s\"). A suitable resin for combining the \"Fiberglas\" with a plastic was developed in 1936 by du Pont. The first ancestor of modern polyester resins is Cyanamid's of 1942. Peroxide curing systems were used by then.\n\nDuring World War II, fiberglass was developed as a replacement for the molded plywood used in aircraft [[radome]]s (fiberglass being [[Transparency (telecommunication)|transparent]] to [[microwaves]]). Its first main civilian application was for the building of [[boat]]s and sports car bodies, where it gained acceptance in the 1950s. Its use has broadened to the automotive and sport equipment sectors. In production of some products, such as aircraft, [[carbon fiber]] is now used instead of fiberglass, which is stronger by volume and weight.\n\nAdvanced manufacturing techniques such as [[pre-preg]]s and [[fiber]] [[roving]]s extend fiberglass's applications and the tensile strength possible with fiber-reinforced plastics.\n\nFiberglass is also used in the [[telecommunications]] industry for [[shroud]]ing [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]], due to its [[radio frequency|RF]] permeability and low signal [[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]] properties. It may also be used to conceal other equipment where no signal permeability is required, such as equipment cabinets and [[steel]] support structures, due to the ease with which it can be molded and painted to blend with existing structures and surfaces. Other uses include sheet-form electrical insulators and structural components commonly found in power-industry products.\n\nBecause of fiberglass's light weight and durability, it is often used in protective equipment such as helmets. Many sports use fiberglass protective gear, such as goaltenders' and catchers' masks.\n\n===Storage tanks===\n[[File:Milwaukee tanks.jpg|right|thumb|Several large fiberglass tanks at an airport]]\n[[Storage tank]]s can be made of fiberglass with capacities up to about 300 [[tonne]]s. Smaller tanks can be made with chopped strand mat cast over a thermoplastic inner tank which acts as a [[Optical fiber#Preform|preform]] during construction. Much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fiber, with the fiber orientation at right angles to the [[hoop stress]] imposed in the side wall by the contents. Such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner (often [[polypropylene]]) is resistant to a wide range of corrosive chemicals. Fiberglass is also used for [[septic tank]]s.\n\n===House building===\n[[File:California-dome-house.jpg|right|thumb|A fiberglass dome house in [[Davis, California]]]]\nGlass-reinforced plastics are also used to produce house building components such as roofing laminate, door surrounds, over-door canopies, window canopies and dormers, chimneys, [[coping (architecture)|coping]] systems, and heads with keystones and sills. The material's reduced weight and easier handling, compared to wood or metal, allows faster installation. Mass-produced fiberglass brick-effect panels can be used in the construction of composite housing, and can include insulation to reduce heat loss.\n\n===Oil and Gas Artificial Lift Systems===\nIn rod pumping applications, fiberglass rods are often used for their high tensile strength to weight ratio. Fiberglass rods provide an advantage over steel rods because they stretch more elastically (lower [[Young's modulus]]) than steel for a given weight, meaning more oil can be lifted from the hydrocarbon reservoir to the surface with each stroke, all while reducing the load on the pumping unit.\n\nFiberglass rods must be kept in tension, however, as they frequently part if placed in even a small amount of compression. Buoyancy of the rods within a fluid amplifies this tendency.\n\n===Piping===\nGRP and GRE pipe can be used in a variety of above- and below-ground systems, including those for:\n\n* desalination\n* water treatment\n* water distribution networks\n* chemical process plants\n* water used for firefighting\n* hot and cold water\n* drinking water\n* wastewater/sewage, Municipal waste\n* [[liquified petroleum gas]]\n\n===Examples of fiberglass use===\n{{Cleanup list|section|date=November 2019}}\n[[Image:Fiberglass Kayaks.jpg|thumb|Kayaks made of fiberglass]]\n* DIY bows / youth recurve; longbows\n* Pole vaulting poles\n*Equipment handles(Hammers, axes, etc.)\n* Traffic lights\n* Ship hulls\n* Rowing shells and oars\n* Waterpipes\n* Helicopter rotor blades\n* [[Surfboard]]s,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ypsjBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=fiberglass+used+in+surfboards#v=onepage&q=fiberglass%20used%20in%20surfboards&f=false|title=An Insider's Guide to Surfing|last=Green|first=Naima|last2=Merlin|first2=Hope|date=2014-12-15|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=9781477780848|language=en}}</ref> tent poles\n* [[Glider (sailplane)|Gliders]], [[kit car]]s, microcars, karts, bodyshells, [[kayak]]s, flat roofs, lorries\n* Pods, domes and architectural features where a light weight is necessary\n* Auto body parts, and entire auto bodies (e.g. [[Sabre Sprint]], [[Lotus Elan]], [[Anadol]], [[Reliant]], Quantum Quantum Coup\u00e9, [[Chevrolet Corvette]] and [[Studebaker Avanti]], and [[DMC DeLorean]] underbody)\n* Antenna covers and structures, such as [[radome]]s, UHF broadcasting antennas, and pipes used in hex beam antennas for amateur radio communications\n* [[FRP tanks and vessels]]: FRP is used extensively to manufacture chemical equipment and tanks and vessels.

The process involves winding filaments under tension over a male mandrel. The mandrel rotates while a wind eye on a carriage moves horizontally, laying down fibers in the desired pattern. The most common filaments are carbon or glass fiber and are coated with synthetic resin as they are wound. Once the mandrel is completely covered to the desired thickness, the resin is cured; often the mandrel is placed in an oven to achieve this, though sometimes radiant heaters are used with the mandrel still turning in the machine. Once the resin has cured, the mandrel is removed, leaving the hollow final product. For some products such as gas bottles the 'mandrel' is a permanent part of the finished product forming a liner to prevent gas leakage or as a barrier to protect the composite from the fluid to be stored.\n\nFilament winding is well suited to automation, and there are many applications, such as pipe and small pressure vessel that are wound and cured without any human intervention. The controlled variables for winding are fiber type, resin content, wind angle, tow or bandwidth and thickness of the fiber bundle. The angle at which the fiber has an effect on the properties of the final product. A high angle \"hoop\" will provide circumferential or \"burst\" strength, while lower angle patterns (polar or helical) will provide greater longitudinal tensile strength.\n\nProducts currently being produced using this technique range from pipes, golf clubs, Reverse Osmosis Membrane Housings, oars, bicycle forks, bicycle rims, power and transmission poles, pressure vessels to missile casings, aircraft fuselages and lamp posts and yacht masts.\n\n===Fiberglass hand lay-up operation===\nA release agent, usually in either wax or liquid form, is applied to the chosen mold to allow finished product to be cleanly removed from the mold. Resin\u2014typically a 2-part [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] polyester, vinyl or epoxy\u2014is mixed with its hardener and applied to the surface. Sheets of fiberglass matting are laid into the mold, then more resin mixture is added using a brush or roller. The material must conform to the mold, and air must not be trapped between the fiberglass and the mold. Additional resin is applied and possibly additional sheets of fiberglass. Hand pressure, vacuum or rollers are used to be sure the resin saturates and fully wets all layers, and that any air pockets are removed. The work must be done quickly, before the resin starts to cure, unless high temperature resins are used which will not cure until the part is warmed in an oven.<ref>{{cite book|author=Forbes Aird|title=Fiberglass & Composite Materials: An Enthusiast's Guide to High Performance Non-Metallic Materials for Automotive Racing and Marine Use|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ileMYXGZ3OQC&pg=PA86|date=1996|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-55788-239-4|pages=86\u2013}}</ref> In some cases, the work is covered with plastic sheets and vacuum is drawn on the work to remove air bubbles and press the fiberglass to the shape of the mold.<ref>{{cite web |last= James |first= Mike |title= An Introduction to Vacuum Bagging Composites |publisher= Nextcraft.com |url= http://www.nextcraft.com/vacuum_bagging_01.html }}</ref>\n\n===Fiberglass spray lay-up operation===\nThe [[fiberglass spray lay-up process]] is similar to the hand lay-up process, but differs in the application of the fiber and resin to the mold. Spray-up is an open-molding composites fabrication process where resin and reinforcements are sprayed onto a mold. The resin and glass may be applied separately or simultaneously \"chopped\" in a combined stream from a chopper gun.<ref>https://evergrip.com/what-is-grp/</ref> Workers roll out the spray-up to compact the laminate. Wood, foam or other core material may then be added, and a secondary spray-up layer imbeds the core between the laminates. The part is then cured, cooled and removed from the reusable mold.\n\n===Pultrusion operation===\n[[Image:Pultrusion process 01.png|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of the [[pultrusion]] process.]]\nPultrusion is a manufacturing method used to make strong, lightweight composite materials. In pultrusion, material is pulled through forming machinery using either a hand-over-hand method or a continuous-roller method (as opposed to [[extrusion]], where the material is pushed through dies).\nIn fiberglass pultrusion, fibers (the glass material) are pulled from spools through a device that coats them with a resin. They are then typically heat-treated and cut to length. Fiberglass produced this way can be made in a variety of shapes and cross-sections, such as W or S cross-sections.\n\n==Warping==\nOne notable feature of fiberglass is that the resins used are subject to contraction during the curing process. For polyester this contraction is often 5\u20136%; for epoxy, about 2%. Because the fibers do not contract, this differential can create changes in the shape of the part during curing. Distortions can appear hours, days or weeks after the resin has set.\n\nWhile this distortion can be minimised by symmetric use of the fibers in the design, a certain amount of internal stress is created; and if it becomes too great, cracks form.\n\n== Health hazards ==\n{{anchor|Health hazards}}\nIn June 2011, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) removed from its Report on [[Carcinogen]]s all biosoluble glass wool used in home and building insulation and for non-insulation products.<ref>{{cite web |title= 13th Report on Carcinogens |work= National Toxicology Program |publisher= [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Dept HHS]] |year= 2011 |url= https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/roc13 |accessdate= 5 Feb 2013 }}</ref> However, NTP considers fibrous glass dust to be \"reasonably anticipated [as] a human carcinogen (Certain Glass Wool Fibers (Inhalable))\".<ref name=\"OSHA\">{{cite web |title= Fibrous Glass Dust |work= [[Occupational Safety & Health Administration|OSHA]] |publisher= U.S. Department of Labor |url= https://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_242120.html }}</ref> Similarly, California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (\"OEHHA\") published a November, 2011 modification to its Proposition 65 listing to include only \"Glass wool fibers (inhalable and biopersistent).\"<ref>46-Z California Regulatory Notice Register, P.1878 (November 18, 2011).</ref> The actions of U.S. NTP and California's OEHHA mean that a cancer warning label for biosoluble fiber glass home and building insulation is no longer required under federal or California law.

Because glass fiber itself is sometimes referred to as \"fiberglass\", the composite is also called \"fiberglass reinforced plastic\". This article will adopt the convention that \"fiberglass\" refers to the complete glass fiber reinforced composite material, rather than only to the glass fiber within it.\n\n== History ==\nGlass fibers have been produced for centuries, but the earliest patent was awarded to the Prussian inventor [[Hermann Hammesfahr]] (1845\u20131914) in the U.S. in 1880.<ref>Mitchell, Steve (November 1999). \"The birth of fiberglass boats,\" The Good Ole Boat.</ref><ref>\"Entry for US 232122 A (14-Sep-1880)\".

A patent for this method of producing glass wool was first applied for in 1933.<ref>Slayter, Games (11 November 1933) \"Method & Apparatus for Making Glass Wool\" {{US Patent|2133235}}</ref> Owens joined with the Corning company in 1935 and the method was adapted by [[Owens Corning]] to produce its patented \"Fiberglas\" (spelled with one \"s\") in 1936. Originally, Fiberglas was a [[glass wool]] with fibers entrapping a great deal of gas, making it useful as an insulator, especially at high temperatures.\n\nA suitable resin for combining the fiberglass with a plastic to produce a composite material was developed in 1936 by [[du Pont]]. The first ancestor of modern polyester resins is [[Cyanamid]]'s resin of 1942. [[Peroxide]] curing systems were used by then.<ref>{{cite web |last= Marsh |first= George |title= 50 years of reinforced plastic boats |work= reinforcedplastics|publisher= Elsevier Ltd |date= 8 Oct 2006 |url= http://www.reinforcedplastics.com/view/1461/50-years-of-reinforced-plastic-boats/ }}</ref> With the combination of fiberglass and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic. This reduced the insulation properties to values typical of the plastic, but now for the first time the composite showed great strength and promise as a structural and building material. Many glass fiber composites continued to be called \"fiberglass\" (as a generic name) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic.\n\nRay Greene of Owens Corning is credited with producing the first composite boat in 1937, but did not proceed further at the time due to the brittle nature of the plastic used. In 1939 Russia was reported to have constructed a passenger boat of plastic materials, and the United States a fuselage and wings of an aircraft.<ref>Notable Progress \u2013 the use of plastics, Evening Post, Wellington, New Zealand, Volume CXXVIII, Issue 31, 5 August 1939, Page 28</ref> The first car to have a fiber-glass body was a 1946 prototype of the [[Stout Scarab]], but the model did not enter production.<ref>{{cite news| last = Hobart| first = Tasmania| title = Car of the future in plastics| newspaper = The Mercury| pages = 16| date = 27 May 1946}}\n</ref>\n\n==Fiber==\n[[File:Glass reinforcements.jpg|thumb|Glass reinforcements used for fiberglass are supplied in different physical forms: microspheres, chopped or woven.]]\nUnlike glass fibers used for insulation, for the final structure to be strong, the fiber's surfaces must be almost entirely free of defects, as this permits the fibers to reach gigapascal [[tensile strength]]s. If a bulk piece of glass were defect-free, it would be equally as strong as glass fibers; however, it is generally impractical to produce and maintain bulk material in a defect-free state outside of laboratory conditions.<ref name=newscience>{{cite book |author=Gordon, J E |title=The New Science of Strong Materials: Or Why You Don't Fall Through the Floor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=axW-iYrhQ1YC|date=1991|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-192770-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Production ===\nThe process of manufacturing fiberglass is called [[pultrusion]]. The manufacturing process for glass fibers suitable for reinforcement uses large furnaces to gradually melt the [[silica]] sand, [[limestone]], [[kaolin clay]], [[fluorspar]], [[colemanite]], [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] and other [[minerals]] until a liquid forms. It is then extruded through bushings, which are bundles of very small orifices (typically 5\u201325 micrometres in diameter for E-Glass, 9 micrometres for S-Glass).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qZPBCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&dq=fiberglass+made+with+aluminosilicate+glass+fibers#v=onepage&q=fiberglass%20made%20with%20aluminosilicate%20glass%20fibers&f=false|title=Lightweight Ballistic Composites: Military and Law-Enforcement Applications|last=Bhatnagar|first=Ashok|date=2016-04-19|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|isbn=9780081004258|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThese filaments are then ''sized'' (coated) with a chemical solution. The individual filaments are now bundled in large numbers to provide a [[roving]]. The diameter of the filaments, and the number of filaments in the roving, determine its ''weight'', typically expressed in one of two measurement systems:\n*''yield'', or yards per pound (the number of yards of fiber in one pound of material; thus a smaller number means a heavier roving). Examples of standard yields are 225yield, 450yield, 675yield.\n*''tex'', or grams per km (how many grams 1&nbsp;km of roving weighs, inverted from yield; thus a smaller number means a lighter roving). Examples of standard tex are 750tex, 1100tex, 2200tex.\n\nThese rovings are then either used directly in a composite application such as [[pultrusion]], [[filament winding]] (pipe), gun roving (where an automated gun chops the glass into short lengths and drops it into a jet of resin, projected onto the surface of a mold), or in an intermediary step, to manufacture fabrics such as ''chopped strand mat'' (CSM) (made of randomly oriented small cut lengths of fiber all bonded together), woven fabrics, knit fabrics or uni-directional fabrics.\n\n====Chopped strand mat====\n'''Chopped strand mat''' or '''CSM''' is a form of reinforcement used in fiberglass. It consists of glass fibers laid randomly across each other and held together by a binder.\n\nIt is typically processed using the hand lay-up technique, where sheets of material are placed on a mold and brushed with resin. Because the binder dissolves in resin, the material easily conforms to different shapes when wetted out. After the resin cures, the hardened product can be taken from the mold and finished.\n\nUsing chopped strand mat gives the fiberglass [[isotropic]] in-plane material properties.\n\n===Sizing===\nA coating or primer is applied to the roving to:\n* help protect the glass filaments for processing and manipulation.\n* ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix, thus allowing for transfer of shear loads from the glass fibers to the thermoset plastic. Without this bonding, the fibers can 'slip' in the matrix, causing localized failure.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fundamentals: Repairing Fiberglass And Ensuring Bonding|author=Reese Gibson|url=http://www.reesesfishhunt.com/how-to-repair-small-hole-fiberglass-boat/ |accessdate=28 April 2017|date=2017-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nAn individual structural glass fiber is both stiff and strong in [[Tension (physics)|tension]] and [[compression (physical)|compression]]\u2014that is, ''along'' its axis. Although it might be assumed that the fiber is weak in compression, it is actually only the long [[aspect ratio]] of the fiber which makes it seem so; i.e., because a typical fiber is long and narrow, it buckles easily.<ref name=newscience/> On the other hand, the glass fiber is weak in shear\u2014that is, ''across'' its axis. Therefore, if a collection of fibers can be arranged permanently in a preferred direction within a material, and if they can be prevented from [[buckling]] in compression, the material will be preferentially strong in that direction.\n\nFurthermore, by laying multiple layers of fiber on top of one another, with each layer oriented in various preferred directions, the material's overall stiffness and strength can be efficiently controlled. In fiberglass, it is the plastic matrix which permanently constrains the structural glass fibers to directions chosen by the designer. With chopped strand mat, this directionality is essentially an entire two dimensional plane; with woven fabrics or unidirectional layers, directionality of stiffness and strength can be more precisely controlled within the plane.\n\nA fiberglass component is typically of a thin \"shell\" construction, sometimes filled on the inside with structural foam, as in the case of surfboards. The component may be of nearly arbitrary shape, limited only by the complexity and tolerances of the [[mold]] used for manufacturing the shell.\n\nThe mechanical functionality of materials is heavily reliant on the combined performances of both the resin (AKA matrix) and fibers. For example, in severe temperature conditions (over 180&nbsp;\u00b0C), the resin component of the composite may lose its functionality, partially due to bond deterioration of resin and fiber.<ref name=CompositeConstruction>{{cite book |author=Bank, Lawrence C.|title=Composites for construction: structural design with FRP materials| url=http://au.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471681261.html| date=2006| publisher=John Wiley & Sons| isbn=978-0-471-68126-7}}</ref> However, GFRPs can still show  significant residual strength after experiencing high temperatures (200&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Russo |first1= Salvatore |first2= Behzad |last2= Ghadimi |first3= Krishna |last3= Lawania|first4= Michele |last4= Rosano|title= Residual strength testing in pultruded FRP material under a variety of temperature cycles and values |journal= Composite Structures |volume= 133 |pages= 458\u2013475 |date= December 2015 |url=   |doi=10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.07.034}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of glass fiber used ===\n{{main|Glass fiber}}\nComposition: the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is [[E-glass]], which is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics.

In order to lower the necessary work temperature, other materials are introduced as \"fluxing agents\" (i.e., components to lower the melting point). Ordinary A-glass (\"A\" for \"alkali-lime\") or soda lime glass, crushed and ready to be remelted, as so-called [[cullet]] glass, was the first type of glass used for fiberglass. E-glass (\"E\" because of initial Electrical application), is alkali free, and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation. It now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world, and also is the single largest consumer of [[boron]] minerals globally. It is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications. S-glass (\"S\" for \"stiff\") is used when tensile strength (high modulus) is important, and is thus an important building and aircraft epoxy composite (it is called R-glass, \"R\" for \"reinforcement\" in Europe). C-glass (\"C\" for \"chemical resistance\") and T-glass (\"T\" is for \"thermal insulator\"\u2014a North American variant of C-glass) are resistant to chemical attack; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass.<ref>{{cite web |title= Fiberglass |publisher= redOrbit.com |url= http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/general-2/inventions/2583670/fiberglass/ |accessdate= 28 Aug 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Table of some common fiberglass types ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was of particular interest to the aviation industry. A means of mass production of glass strands was accidentally discovered in 1932 when a researcher at [[Owens-Illinois]] directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers. After Owens merged with the Corning company in 1935, [[Owens Corning]] adapted the method to produce its patented \"Fiberglas\" (one \"s\"). A suitable resin for combining the \"Fiberglas\" with a plastic was developed in 1936 by du Pont. The first ancestor of modern polyester resins is Cyanamid's of 1942. Peroxide curing systems were used by then.\n\nDuring World War II, fiberglass was developed as a replacement for the molded plywood used in aircraft [[radome]]s (fiberglass being [[Transparency (telecommunication)|transparent]] to [[microwaves]]). Its first main civilian application was for the building of [[boat]]s and sports car bodies, where it gained acceptance in the 1950s. Its use has broadened to the automotive and sport equipment sectors. In production of some products, such as aircraft, [[carbon fiber]] is now used instead of fiberglass, which is stronger by volume and weight.\n\nAdvanced manufacturing techniques such as [[pre-preg]]s and [[fiber]] [[roving]]s extend fiberglass's applications and the tensile strength possible with fiber-reinforced plastics.\n\nFiberglass is also used in the [[telecommunications]] industry for [[shroud]]ing [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]], due to its [[radio frequency|RF]] permeability and low signal [[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]] properties. It may also be used to conceal other equipment where no signal permeability is required, such as equipment cabinets and [[steel]] support structures, due to the ease with which it can be molded and painted to blend with existing structures and surfaces. Other uses include sheet-form electrical insulators and structural components commonly found in power-industry products.\n\nBecause of fiberglass's light weight and durability, it is often used in protective equipment such as helmets. Many sports use fiberglass protective gear, such as goaltenders' and catchers' masks.\n\n===Storage tanks===\n[[File:Milwaukee tanks.jpg|right|thumb|Several large fiberglass tanks at an airport]]\n[[Storage tank]]s can be made of fiberglass with capacities up to about 300 [[tonne]]s. Smaller tanks can be made with chopped strand mat cast over a thermoplastic inner tank which acts as a [[Optical fiber#Preform|preform]] during construction. Much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fiber, with the fiber orientation at right angles to the [[hoop stress]] imposed in the side wall by the contents. Such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner (often [[polypropylene]]) is resistant to a wide range of corrosive chemicals. Fiberglass is also used for [[septic tank]]s.\n\n===House building===\n[[File:California-dome-house.jpg|right|thumb|A fiberglass dome house in [[Davis, California]]]]\nGlass-reinforced plastics are also used to produce house building components such as roofing laminate, door surrounds, over-door canopies, window canopies and dormers, chimneys, [[coping (architecture)|coping]] systems, and heads with keystones and sills. The material's reduced weight and easier handling, compared to wood or metal, allows faster installation. Mass-produced fiberglass brick-effect panels can be used in the construction of composite housing, and can include insulation to reduce heat loss.\n\n===Oil and Gas Artificial Lift Systems===\nIn rod pumping applications, fiberglass rods are often used for their high tensile strength to weight ratio. Fiberglass rods provide an advantage over steel rods because they stretch more elastically (lower [[Young's modulus]]) than steel for a given weight, meaning more oil can be lifted from the hydrocarbon reservoir to the surface with each stroke, all while reducing the load on the pumping unit.\n\nFiberglass rods must be kept in tension, however, as they frequently part if placed in even a small amount of compression. Buoyancy of the rods within a fluid amplifies this tendency.\n\n===Piping===\nGRP and GRE pipe can be used in a variety of above- and below-ground systems, including those for:\n\n* desalination\n* water treatment\n* water distribution networks\n* chemical process plants\n* water used for firefighting\n* hot and cold water\n* drinking water\n* wastewater/sewage, Municipal waste\n* [[liquified petroleum gas]]\n\n===Examples of fiberglass use===\n{{Cleanup list|section|date=November 2019}}\n[[Image:Fiberglass Kayaks.jpg|thumb|Kayaks made of fiberglass]]\n* DIY bows / youth recurve; longbows\n* Pole vaulting poles\n*Equipment handles(Hammers, axes, etc.)\n* Traffic lights\n* Ship hulls\n* Rowing shells and oars\n* Waterpipes\n* Helicopter rotor blades\n* [[Surfboard]]s,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ypsjBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=fiberglass+used+in+surfboards#v=onepage&q=fiberglass%20used%20in%20surfboards&f=false|title=An Insider's Guide to Surfing|last=Green|first=Naima|last2=Merlin|first2=Hope|date=2014-12-15|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=9781477780848|language=en}}</ref> tent poles\n* [[Glider (sailplane)|Gliders]], [[kit car]]s, microcars, karts, bodyshells, [[kayak]]s, flat roofs, lorries\n* Pods, domes and architectural features where a light weight is necessary\n* Auto body parts, and entire auto bodies (e.g. [[Sabre Sprint]], [[Lotus Elan]], [[Anadol]], [[Reliant]], Quantum Quantum Coup\u00e9, [[Chevrolet Corvette]] and [[Studebaker Avanti]], and [[DMC DeLorean]] underbody)\n* Antenna covers and structures, such as [[radome]]s, UHF broadcasting antennas, and pipes used in hex beam antennas for amateur radio communications\n* [[FRP tanks and vessels]]: FRP is used extensively to manufacture chemical equipment and tanks and vessels.

The process involves winding filaments under tension over a male mandrel. The mandrel rotates while a wind eye on a carriage moves horizontally, laying down fibers in the desired pattern. The most common filaments are carbon or glass fiber and are coated with synthetic resin as they are wound. Once the mandrel is completely covered to the desired thickness, the resin is cured; often the mandrel is placed in an oven to achieve this, though sometimes radiant heaters are used with the mandrel still turning in the machine. Once the resin has cured, the mandrel is removed, leaving the hollow final product. For some products such as gas bottles the 'mandrel' is a permanent part of the finished product forming a liner to prevent gas leakage or as a barrier to protect the composite from the fluid to be stored.\n\nFilament winding is well suited to automation, and there are many applications, such as pipe and small pressure vessel that are wound and cured without any human intervention. The controlled variables for winding are fiber type, resin content, wind angle, tow or bandwidth and thickness of the fiber bundle. The angle at which the fiber has an effect on the properties of the final product. A high angle \"hoop\" will provide circumferential or \"burst\" strength, while lower angle patterns (polar or helical) will provide greater longitudinal tensile strength.\n\nProducts currently being produced using this technique range from pipes, golf clubs, Reverse Osmosis Membrane Housings, oars, bicycle forks, bicycle rims, power and transmission poles, pressure vessels to missile casings, aircraft fuselages and lamp posts and yacht masts.\n\n===Fiberglass hand lay-up operation===\nA release agent, usually in either wax or liquid form, is applied to the chosen mold to allow finished product to be cleanly removed from the mold. Resin\u2014typically a 2-part [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] polyester, vinyl or epoxy\u2014is mixed with its hardener and applied to the surface. Sheets of fiberglass matting are laid into the mold, then more resin mixture is added using a brush or roller. The material must conform to the mold, and air must not be trapped between the fiberglass and the mold. Additional resin is applied and possibly additional sheets of fiberglass. Hand pressure, vacuum or rollers are used to be sure the resin saturates and fully wets all layers, and that any air pockets are removed. The work must be done quickly, before the resin starts to cure, unless high temperature resins are used which will not cure until the part is warmed in an oven.<ref>{{cite book|author=Forbes Aird|title=Fiberglass & Composite Materials: An Enthusiast's Guide to High Performance Non-Metallic Materials for Automotive Racing and Marine Use|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ileMYXGZ3OQC&pg=PA86|date=1996|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-55788-239-4|pages=86\u2013}}</ref> In some cases, the work is covered with plastic sheets and vacuum is drawn on the work to remove air bubbles and press the fiberglass to the shape of the mold.<ref>{{cite web |last= James |first= Mike |title= An Introduction to Vacuum Bagging Composites |publisher= Nextcraft.com |url= http://www.nextcraft.com/vacuum_bagging_01.html }}</ref>\n\n===Fiberglass spray lay-up operation===\nThe [[fiberglass spray lay-up process]] is similar to the hand lay-up process, but differs in the application of the fiber and resin to the mold. Spray-up is an open-molding composites fabrication process where resin and reinforcements are sprayed onto a mold. The resin and glass may be applied separately or simultaneously \"chopped\" in a combined stream from a chopper gun.<ref>https://evergrip.com/what-is-grp/</ref> Workers roll out the spray-up to compact the laminate. Wood, foam or other core material may then be added, and a secondary spray-up layer imbeds the core between the laminates. The part is then cured, cooled and removed from the reusable mold.\n\n===Pultrusion operation===\n[[Image:Pultrusion process 01.png|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of the [[pultrusion]] process.]]\nPultrusion is a manufacturing method used to make strong, lightweight composite materials. In pultrusion, material is pulled through forming machinery using either a hand-over-hand method or a continuous-roller method (as opposed to [[extrusion]], where the material is pushed through dies).\nIn fiberglass pultrusion, fibers (the glass material) are pulled from spools through a device that coats them with a resin. They are then typically heat-treated and cut to length. Fiberglass produced this way can be made in a variety of shapes and cross-sections, such as W or S cross-sections.\n\n==Warping==\nOne notable feature of fiberglass is that the resins used are subject to contraction during the curing process. For polyester this contraction is often 5\u20136%; for epoxy, about 2%. Because the fibers do not contract, this differential can create changes in the shape of the part during curing. Distortions can appear hours, days or weeks after the resin has set.\n\nWhile this distortion can be minimised by symmetric use of the fibers in the design, a certain amount of internal stress is created; and if it becomes too great, cracks form.\n\n== Health hazards ==\n{{anchor|Health hazards}}\nIn June 2011, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) removed from its Report on [[Carcinogen]]s all biosoluble glass wool used in home and building insulation and for non-insulation products.<ref>{{cite web |title= 13th Report on Carcinogens |work= National Toxicology Program |publisher= [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Dept HHS]] |year= 2011 |url= https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/roc13 |accessdate= 5 Feb 2013 }}</ref> However, NTP considers fibrous glass dust to be \"reasonably anticipated [as] a human carcinogen (Certain Glass Wool Fibers (Inhalable))\".<ref name=\"OSHA\">{{cite web |title= Fibrous Glass Dust |work= [[Occupational Safety & Health Administration|OSHA]] |publisher= U.S. Department of Labor |url= https://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_242120.html }}</ref> Similarly, California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (\"OEHHA\") published a November, 2011 modification to its Proposition 65 listing to include only \"Glass wool fibers (inhalable and biopersistent).\"<ref>46-Z California Regulatory Notice Register, P.1878 (November 18, 2011).</ref> The actions of U.S. NTP and California's OEHHA mean that a cancer warning label for biosoluble fiber glass home and building insulation is no longer required under federal or California law.

These experts concluded: \"Epidemiologic studies published during the 15 years since the previous IARC monographs review of these fibers in 1988 provide no evidence of increased risks of lung cancer or mesothelioma (cancer of the lining of the body cavities) from occupational exposures during the manufacture of these materials, and inadequate evidence overall of any cancer risk.\"<ref name=\"iarc.fr\"/> Similar reviews of the epidemiology studies have been conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (\"ATSDR\"),<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp161.pdf |title= Toxicological Profile for Synthethic Vitreous Fibers |author= Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry\n |date= September 2004 |publisher= [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Dept HHS]] |pages= 5, 18 |format= PDF }}</ref> the National Toxicology Program,<ref>Charles William Jameson, \"Comments on the National Toxicology Program's Actions In Removing Biosoluble Glass Wool Fibers From The Report On Carcinogens,\" September 9, 2011.</ref> the National Academy of Sciences<ref>NRC Subcommittee on Manufactured Vitreous Fibers. 2000.

Historically, the term was invented by [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Turkology|Turkologists]] like [[Nikita Bichurin]] in the 19th century as a more neutral term to replace another [[Western world|Western]] (and politically contentious) term, '''Chinese Turkestan''', which referred to the [[Tarim Basin]] in the southwestern part of [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Province]] of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The medieval [[Persian language|Persian]] toponym \"[[Turkestan]]\" and its derivatives were not used by the local population of the greater region and China had its own name for an overlapping area since the [[Han dynasty]] as the [[Western Regions]], with the parts controlled by China termed Xinjiang from the 18th century onward. The historical Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is [[Altishahr]], which means \"Six Cities\" in Uyghur.\n\nStarting in the 20th century, [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] separatists and their supporters used East Turkestan (or Uyghurstan) as an appellation for the whole of Xinjiang, or for a [[East Turkestan independence movement|future independent state]] in present-day Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (presumably with [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]] as its capital). They reject the name of Xinjiang (meaning \"New Frontier\" in Chinese) because of the Chinese perspective reflected in the name and prefer East Turkestan to emphasize connection to other, westerly, [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups. However, even in nationalist writing, East Turkestan retained its older, more narrow geographical meaning. In China, the term has negative connotations because of its origins in [[The Great Game|European colonialism]] and present use by militant groups. The [[government of China]] actively discourages its use.\n\nEast Turkestan is a founding member state of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] (UNPO), which was formed in 1991.<ref name=\"UNPO\">{{Cite web |title = UNPO: East Turkestan |publisher=[[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] |access-date=24 April 2019 |url = https://unpo.org/members/7872 |date = 16 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Current usage ==\n\nThe term \"East Turkestan\" is inextricably linked with politics.<ref name=\"Starr\" /> In general, most of the [[toponym]]s for places in [[Central Asia]]\u2014although its boundaries and Xinjiang's inclusion in it are disputed\u2014do not reflect the region's diversity.<ref name=\"Humphrey\">{{cite book |title = The End of Nomadism?

Historically, the term was invented by [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Turkology|Turkologists]] like [[Nikita Bichurin]] in the 19th century as a more neutral term to replace another [[Western world|Western]] (and politically contentious) term, '''Chinese Turkestan''', which referred to the [[Tarim Basin]] in the southwestern part of [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Province]] of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The medieval [[Persian language|Persian]] toponym \"[[Turkestan]]\" and its derivatives were not used by the local population of the greater region and China had its own name for an overlapping area since the [[Han dynasty]] as the [[Western Regions]], with the parts controlled by China termed Xinjiang from the 18th century onward. The historical Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is [[Altishahr]], which means \"Six Cities\" in Uyghur.\n\nStarting in the 20th century, [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] separatists and their supporters used East Turkestan (or Uyghurstan) as an appellation for the whole of Xinjiang, or for a [[East Turkestan independence movement|future independent state]] in present-day Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (presumably with [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]] as its capital). They reject the name of Xinjiang (meaning \"New Frontier\" in Chinese) because of the Chinese perspective reflected in the name and prefer East Turkestan to emphasize connection to other, westerly, [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups. However, even in nationalist writing, East Turkestan retained its older, more narrow geographical meaning. In China, the term has negative connotations because of its origins in [[The Great Game|European colonialism]] and present use by militant groups. The [[government of China]] actively discourages its use.\n\nEast Turkestan is a founding member state of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] (UNPO), which was formed in 1991.<ref name=\"UNPO\">{{Cite web |title = UNPO: East Turkestan |publisher=[[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] |access-date=24 April 2019 |url = https://unpo.org/members/7872 |date = 16 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Current usage ==\n\nThe term \"East Turkestan\" is inextricably linked with politics.<ref name=\"Starr\" /> In general, most of the [[toponym]]s for places in [[Central Asia]]\u2014although its boundaries and Xinjiang's inclusion in it are disputed\u2014do not reflect the region's diversity.<ref name=\"Humphrey\">{{cite book |title = The End of Nomadism?

She demonstrated this concept of dualism in her project \"Loteria.\" By using images of the well known Mexican card game, she projected these images on the naked bodies of her New York friends and loved ones. This is also representative of Fernando Ortiz's concept of [[transculturation]]. By using the images of \"Loteria\" onto the human bodies of New York residents, she demonstrates how culture [[counter-flows]] through people's migration patterns, which is a form of [[cultural remittances]].\n\n== Awards ==\n2012 -

His translations of [[Sanskrit]] texts into [[Greek (language)|Greek]] made knowledge of the philosophical and religious ideas of [[India]] available to many [[Europe]]ans.\n\nBorn in [[Athens]], [[Ottoman Empire]] (present-day [[Greece]]) in 1760, he spent 47 years in India, where he translated many [[Hindu]] sacred texts into Greek and compiled a Sanskrit-English-Greek [[dictionary]] of over 9000 words.  He died on 3 May 1833 in [[Varanasi]], India.  He was buried in the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] cemetery there, and his tombstone is inscribed with the epitaph, \"\u0395\u0399\u03a3 \u039c\u039d\u0397\u039c\u0397\u039d \u0394\u0397\u039c\u0397\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a5 \u0393\u0391\u039b\u0391\u039d\u039f\u03a5 \u03a4\u039f\u03a5 \u0391\u0398\u0397\u039d\u0391\u0399\u039f\u03a5\" (in memory of Dimitrios Galanos the Athenian). [[Munshi Sital Singh]] (a \"wise Brahman\" who was a friend and teacher of Galanos) wrote these verses in Hindustani, which he affixed above the tomb: \"Woe, a hundred times! Dimitrios Galanos departed from this world to the eternal monads. Woe me! Weeping and wailing have I said it. I am out of myself.

He was a friend of the Muses and a man of learning. He shone brightly in fame and vocation. He left this wearisome life and departed for a life without affiction and eternal. Out of gratitude, his nephew Pandoleon erects this cenotaph for his eternal memory\" (Schulz 1969, p.&nbsp;355).\n\nGalanos lived at [[Calcutta]] for 6 years.

His translations of [[Sanskrit]] texts into [[Greek (language)|Greek]] made knowledge of the philosophical and religious ideas of [[India]] available to many [[Europe]]ans.\n\nBorn in [[Athens]], [[Ottoman Empire]] (present-day [[Greece]]) in 1760, he spent 47 years in India, where he translated many [[Hindu]] sacred texts into Greek and compiled a Sanskrit-English-Greek [[dictionary]] of over 9000 words.  He died on 3 May 1833 in [[Varanasi]], India.

It is up to cyberfeminists to use feminist theoretical insights and strategic tools and join them with cybertechniques to battle the very real sexism, racism, and militarism encoded in the software and hardware of the Net, thus politicizing this environment.\"\n\n[[Donna Haraway]] is the inspiration and genesis for cyberfeminism with her 1985 essay \"[[A Cyborg Manifesto|A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century]]\" which was reprinted in ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature'' (1991).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cybersexualities : a reader on feminist theory, cyborgs, and cyberspace|date=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|others=Wolmark, Jenny.|isbn=978-0748611171|location=Edinburgh|oclc=42579667}}</ref> Haraway's essay states that cyborgs are able to transcend the public and private spheres, but they do not have the ability to identify with their origins or with nature in order to develop a sense of understanding through differences between self and others.

Guertin goes on to say that the first Cyberfeminist International, organized by the Old Boys Network in [[Germany]], in 1997, refused to define the school of thought, but drafted the \"100 Anti-Theses of Cyberfeminism\" instead.

It is up to cyberfeminists to use feminist theoretical insights and strategic tools and join them with cybertechniques to battle the very real sexism, racism, and militarism encoded in the software and hardware of the Net, thus politicizing this environment.\"\n\n[[Donna Haraway]] is the inspiration and genesis for cyberfeminism with her 1985 essay \"[[A Cyborg Manifesto|A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century]]\" which was reprinted in ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature'' (1991).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cybersexualities : a reader on feminist theory, cyborgs, and cyberspace|date=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|others=Wolmark, Jenny.|isbn=978-0748611171|location=Edinburgh|oclc=42579667}}</ref> Haraway's essay states that cyborgs are able to transcend the public and private spheres, but they do not have the ability to identify with their origins or with nature in order to develop a sense of understanding through differences between self and others.

Guertin goes on to say that the first Cyberfeminist International, organized by the Old Boys Network in [[Germany]], in 1997, refused to define the school of thought, but drafted the \"100 Anti-Theses of Cyberfeminism\" instead. Guertin says that Cyberfeminism is a celebration of [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]].\n\nIn 1996, a special volume of ''Women & Performance'' was devoted to sexuality and cyberspace.

'Race abolitionism' expands into a similar formula \u2013 that the struggle must continue until currently racialized characteristics are no more a basis of discrimination than the color of one's eyes.

Leaves are similar to ''[[Populus tremuloides]]'', but slightly larger and having larger teeth.<ref>{{cite book |title=Trees and Shrubs of Minnesota: the Complete Guide to Species Identification |first=Welby R. |last=Smith |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |date=2008 }}</ref> The leaves tremble in the wind as ''P. tremuloides'' does. Bark of younger trees is olive-green, thin and smooth; after 30\u201340 years, the bark is gray, thick and rough with grooves.\n\n== Reproduction ==\nBigtooth aspens produce seeds from wind-pollinated flower clusters, known as [[catkin]]s. The tree is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are on separate trees, which flower from mid-April to mid-May depending on the climate zone. The seed, a two-valved capsule, is distributed widely by the wind. Seed production begins around 10 years old. Individuals can also reproduce through the roots after a disturbance event, such as fire or harvest; the roots of the dead/cut tree will begin to send up suckers, creating identical individuals, and can result in a stand of clones that resemble that individual. Seeds viability is high (around 80%) but despite this and the sheer number of seeds produced (a mature tree can produce over 1 million per season), very few actually end up germinating due to their short viability (two weeks), natural growth inhibitor, and high likelihood of landing in spots unsuitable for germination, which must be done on the surface of moist soil.<ref name=\"rook.org\">{{cite web |title=Big Tooth Aspen, Populus grandidentata |first=Earl J.S. |last=Rook |date=2002 |url=http://www.rook.org/earl/bwca/nature/trees/populusgrand.html |url-status=dead |website=The Natural History of the Northwoods |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315170645/http://www.rook.org/earl/bwca/nature/trees/populusgrand.html |archive-date=2017-03-15}}</ref>\n\n== Growth ==\nBigtooth aspens are [[dioecious]], medium-sized deciduous trees with straight trunks and gently ascending branches. Heights at maturity are around {{convert|60|\u2013|80|ft|m}} with diameters of {{convert|8|\u2013|10|in|cm}}. They are fast growing and are relatively short-lived; stands will begin to deteriorate after 60\u201370 years, while individuals can live up to 100 years. They often constitute early successional species of their landscapes. Roots are shallow and wide spreading; lateral root growth in a forest may be as far as {{convert|60|ft}}.<ref name=\"rook.org\" /> Generally, four to five lateral roots originate from the tree, and then branch within {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}}; vertical, penetrating roots near the base anchor the tree.\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe range of ''Populus grandidentata'' extends from Virginia north to Maine and Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia; west to southeastern Manitoba and Minnesota; south through Iowa to extreme northeastern Missouri; and east through Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and West Virginia. Disjunct populations are found in Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina.<ref>{{FEIS |genus=Populus |species=grandidentata |type=tree |last=Carey |first=Jennifer H. |date=1994}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe species is able to adapt to a wide range of soils, though it is most abundant on sands, loamy sands and light sandy loams. Big-tooth aspens can tolerate sandy uplands and high, rocky sites. The depth to the water table is generally about {{convert|5|ft}}.<ref>{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Populus |species=grandidentata |first=Paul R. |last=Laidly}}</ref> Soil must be moist but well-aerated for good growth. Being very shade intolerant, most shaded stems die. They are pioneer species on disturbed sites, persisting in successional communities until senescence. Rapid height growth of suckers allows it to outcompete other sprouting species such as [[red oak]] (''Quercus rubra'') and [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum'') on many sites. In the absence of disturbance, it is soon replaced by conifers and hardwoods. In the Great Lakes Region at the turn of the 20th century, many mature pine forests were logged and burned. Bigtooth and quaking aspens frequently dominated the postdisturbance forests. Without fire or other disturbance, these forests are being replaced by later successional, shade-tolerant species. This aspen usually grows in even-aged, mixed stands, most commonly with quaking aspens. Codominant in both hardwood and conifer forests, it does not occur as a subdominant because of its extreme shade intolerance. [[Quaking aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') is the predominant species in aspen stands in the Great Lakes region, but bigtooth aspen dominates on drier, upland sites. Aspen stands dominated by bigtooth aspens are generally more open than those dominated by quaking aspens. It is more disease resistant than ''P. tremuloides''. The most serious disease is hypoxylon canker (caused by ''[[Entoleuca mammata]]''). Other rots, fungi, and root decay affect this species. A preferred host of [[gypsy moth]], death occurs when nearly complete defoliation by gypsy moths is followed by a fungal infection by ''[[Armillaria]]'' spp. The ambrosia beetle (''[[Xyleborus saxesceni]]'') attacks fire-damaged bigtooth aspens. Commonly, it occurs in areas that frequently burn, such as large upland areas distant from water and upwind of natural fire breaks, such as lakes.\n\n== Uses ==\nVarious wildlife feed on the bark, foliage, and twig buds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Little|first=Elbert L.|title=The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Trees: Eastern Region|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|year=1980|isbn=0-394-50760-6|p=324}}</ref>\n\nThe wood weighs 27 pounds (12 kg) per foot and is light-colored, straight-grained, fine-textured, and soft. It is used primarily for pulp, but can be used to make particle board and structural panels. Minor uses include log homes, pallets, boxes, match splints, chopsticks, hockey stick components, and ladders.
