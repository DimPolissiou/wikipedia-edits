[[Early Christianity|Early Christians]] were [[persecution|persecuted]] for their [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] at the hands of both the [[Persecution of Christians by the Jews|Jews]] from [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|whose religion Christianity arose]] and the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|Romans]] who controlled many of the [[Early centers of Christianity|lands across which early Christianity was spread]]. [[Christianity in the 4th century|Early in the fourth century]], a form of the religion was legalized by the [[Edict of Milan]], and it eventually became the [[State church of the Roman Empire]].\n\n[[Christian missionaries]] as well as [[converts to Christianity]] have been targets of persecution ever since the emergence of [[Christianity]], sometimes to the point of being [[Martyrdom|martyred for their faith]].\n\nThe [[schism]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] and the later [[Protestant Reformation]], sometimes provoked [[European wars of religion|severe conflicts]] between [[Christian denominations]] and during these conflicts, the members of these different denominations [[Persecution of Christians by Christians|frequently]] and [[Sectarian violence among Christians|violently persecuted each other]].\n\nIn the 20th century, Christians were persecuted, sometimes to the point of [[genocide]], by various governments, including the government of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which committed the [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian]], [[Assyrian Genocide|Assyrian]] and [[Greek Genocide|Greek Genocides]], and the governments of [[state atheism|atheistic states]] such as the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Communist Albania]]  and [[North Korea]].\n\n==Antiquity==\n{{see also|Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire}}\n\n===In the New Testament===\n{{main|Persecution of Christians in the New Testament}}\n[[Early Christianity]] began as a sect among [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple Jews]], and according to the New Testament account, [[Pharisees]], including [[Paul of Tarsus]] prior to his conversion to Christianity, persecuted early Christians. The early Christians preached the second coming of a Messiah which [[Jewish view of Jesus|did not conform]] to their [[Jewish Messianism|religious teachings]].{{sfn|Wand|1990|p=12}} However, feeling that their beliefs were supported by Jewish scripture, Christians had been hopeful that their countrymen would accept their faith. Despite individual conversions, the vast majority of Judean Jews did not become Christians.{{sfn|Wand|1990|p=13}}\n\nClaudia Setzer asserts that, \"Jews did not see Christians as clearly separate from their own community until at least the middle of the second century.\"  Thus, acts of Jewish persecution of Christians fall within the boundaries of synagogue discipline and were so perceived by Jews acting and thinking as the established community.

Decius authorized [[roving commission]]s visiting the cities and villages to supervise the execution of the sacrifices and to deliver written certificates to all citizens who performed them. Christians were often given opportunities to avoid further punishment by publicly offering sacrifices or by burning incense to Roman gods, and were accused by the Romans of impiety when they refused. Refusal was punished by arrest, imprisonment, torture, and executions. Christians fled to safe havens in the countryside and some purchased their certificates, called ''libelli.'' Several councils held at [[Carthage]] debated the extent to which the community should accept these lapsed Christians. \nThe Christian church, despite no indication in the surviving texts that the edict targeted any specific group, never forgot the reign of Decius whom they labelled as that \"fierce tyrant\".<ref name = Scarre170>Scarre 1995, p.170</ref>\n\nSome early Christians sought out and welcomed martyrdom.

The 2nd-century text ''[[Martyrdom of Polycarp]]'' relates the story of Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, who did not desire death, but died a [[martyr]], bound and burned at the stake, then stabbed when the fire miraculously failed to touch him. The ''Martyrdom of Polycarp'' advances an argument for a particular understanding of martyrdom, with Polycarp's death as its prized example. The example of the Phrygian Quintus, who actively sought out martyrdom, is repudiated.\n\nAccording to two different Christian traditions, [[Simon bar Kokhba]], the leader of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|second Jewish revolt against Rome]] (132\u2013136 AD) who was proclaimed Messiah, persecuted the Christians: Justin Martyr claims that Christians were punished if they did not deny and blaspheme Jesus Christ, while Eusebius asserts that Bar Kokhba harassed them because they refused to join his revolt against the Romans.<ref>Justin, I ''Apology'' 31, 6; Eusebius, ''Chronicle'', seventeenth year of the Emperor Hadrian.

The [[Great Persecution]] is considered the largest. Beginning with a series of four edicts banning Christian practices and ordering the imprisonment of Christian clergy, the persecution intensified until all Christians in the empire were commanded to sacrifice to the [[Roman gods]] or face immediate execution.  According to legend, one of the [[martyrs]] during the Diocletian persecution was [[Saint George]], a Roman soldier who loudly renounced the Emperor's edict, and in front of his fellow soldiers and tribunes claimed to be a Christian by declaring his worship of [[Jesus Christ]]. Though [[Diocletian]] zealously persecuted Christians in the Eastern part of the empire, his co-emperors in the West did not follow the edicts so Christians in [[Gaul]], [[Spain]], and [[Britannia]] were virtually unmolested.\n\nThis persecution lasted until [[Constantine I]] came to power in 313 and legalized Christianity. It was not until [[Theodosius I]] in the later 4th century that Christianity would become the official religion of the Empire. Between these two events [[Julian the Apostate|Julian II]] temporarily restored the traditional Roman religion and established broad religious tolerance renewing Pagan and Christian hostilities.\n\nMartyrs were considered uniquely exemplary of the Christian faith, and few early saints were not also martyrs.\n\nThe ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' states that \"Ancient, medieval and early modern hagiographers were inclined to exaggerate the number of martyrs. Since the title of martyr is the highest title to which a Christian can aspire, this tendency is natural\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howells |first1=Kristina |title=Making Sense of Bible Prophecy |date=2008 |publisher=Lulu |isbn=978-1409207832 |page=91}}</ref>  Attempts at estimating the numbers involved are inevitably based on inadequate sources, but one historian of the persecutions estimates the overall numbers as between 5,500 and 6,500.,<ref name=\"Frend\">{{cite book |title=The Rise of Christianity |author=W.

The punishment of apostates increased under [[Yazdegerd I]] and continued under successive kings. It was normative for apostates who were brought to the notice of authorities to be executed, although the prosecution of apostasy depended on political circumstances and Zoroastrian jurisprudence. Per Richard E. Payne, the executions were meant to create a mutually recognised boundary between interactions of the people of the two religions and preventing one religion challenging another's viability. Although the violence on Christians was selective and especially carried out on elites, it served to keep Christian communities in a subordinate and yet viable position in relation to Zoroastrianism. Christians were allowed to build religious buildings and serve in the government as long as they didn't expand their institutions and population at the expense of Zoroastrianism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rtjsCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA55#v=onepage&f=false|title=A State of Mixture: Christians, Zoroastrians, and Iranian Political Culture in Late Antiquity|publisher=University of California Press|author=Richard E.

Many churches in Malabar and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. Many centuries-old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Saint Thomas Christians were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Saint Thomas Christian farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.<ref name= Bernard >K.L. Bernard, ''Kerala History '', pp. 79</ref>\n\nTipu's persecution of Christians also extended to captured British soldiers. For instance, there were a significant amount of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the [[battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Martyrs of Japan}}\n[[File:ChristianMartyrsOfNagasaki.jpg|thumb|The Christian martyrs of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. 17th-century Japanese painting.]]\n[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] assumed control over Japan in 1600.

Further exacerbating relations was the fact that Christians seemed to benefit disproportionately from efforts at reform (one aspect of which generally sought to elevate the political status of non-Muslims), likewise, the various Christian nationalist uprisings in the Empire's European territories, which often had the support of the European powers.<ref>Erik Freas, Muslim-Christian Relations in Late-Ottoman Palestine: Where Nationalism and Religion Intersect (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016), {{ISBN|1137570415}}</ref>\n\nSince the time of the [[Great Turkish War|Austro-Turkish war (1683\u20131699)]] relations between Muslims and Christians in the European provinces of the Ottoman Empire gradually took more extreme forms{{vague|date=January 2018}} and resulted in occasional calls by some Muslim religious leaders for the expulsion or extermination of local Christians.

A very large segment of its clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested.\nThe widespread persecution and internecine disputes within the church hierarchy lead to the seat of [[Patriarch of Moscow]] being vacant from 1925 to 1943.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church in order to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957, about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985, fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.<ref name=Ostling/>\n\nIn the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closure and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated by the state and converted to public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. With the exception of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy, it could not instruct the faithful or evangelise the youth.

The ''Martyrdom of Polycarp'' advances an argument for a particular understanding of martyrdom, with Polycarp's death as its prized example.

The [[Great Persecution]] is considered the largest. Beginning with a series of four edicts banning Christian practices and ordering the imprisonment of Christian clergy, the persecution intensified until all Christians in the empire were commanded to sacrifice to the [[Roman gods]] or face immediate execution.  According to legend, one of the [[martyrs]] during the Diocletian persecution was [[Saint George]], a Roman soldier who loudly renounced the Emperor's edict, and in front of his fellow soldiers and tribunes claimed to be a Christian by declaring his worship of [[Jesus Christ]]. Though [[Diocletian]] zealously persecuted Christians in the Eastern part of the empire, his co-emperors in the West did not follow the edicts so Christians in [[Gaul]], [[Spain]], and [[Britannia]] were virtually unmolested.\n\nThis persecution lasted until [[Constantine I]] came to power in 313 and legalized Christianity. It was not until [[Theodosius I]] in the later 4th century that Christianity would become the official religion of the Empire. Between these two events [[Julian the Apostate|Julian II]] temporarily restored the traditional Roman religion and established broad religious tolerance renewing Pagan and Christian hostilities.\n\nMartyrs were considered uniquely exemplary of the Christian faith, and few early saints were not also martyrs.\n\nThe ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' states that \"Ancient, medieval and early modern hagiographers were inclined to exaggerate the number of martyrs.

The punishment of apostates increased under [[Yazdegerd I]] and continued under successive kings. It was normative for apostates who were brought to the notice of authorities to be executed, although the prosecution of apostasy depended on political circumstances and Zoroastrian jurisprudence. Per Richard E. Payne, the executions were meant to create a mutually recognised boundary between interactions of the people of the two religions and preventing one religion challenging another's viability.

Many churches in Malabar and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. Many centuries-old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Saint Thomas Christians were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Saint Thomas Christian farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.<ref name= Bernard >K.L. Bernard, ''Kerala History '', pp. 79</ref>\n\nTipu's persecution of Christians also extended to captured British soldiers. For instance, there were a significant amount of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the [[battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Martyrs of Japan}}\n[[File:ChristianMartyrsOfNagasaki.jpg|thumb|The Christian martyrs of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. 17th-century Japanese painting.]]\n[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] assumed control over Japan in 1600.

Further exacerbating relations was the fact that Christians seemed to benefit disproportionately from efforts at reform (one aspect of which generally sought to elevate the political status of non-Muslims), likewise, the various Christian nationalist uprisings in the Empire's European territories, which often had the support of the European powers.<ref>Erik Freas, Muslim-Christian Relations in Late-Ottoman Palestine: Where Nationalism and Religion Intersect (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016), {{ISBN|1137570415}}</ref>\n\nSince the time of the [[Great Turkish War|Austro-Turkish war (1683\u20131699)]] relations between Muslims and Christians in the European provinces of the Ottoman Empire gradually took more extreme forms{{vague|date=January 2018}} and resulted in occasional calls by some Muslim religious leaders for the expulsion or extermination of local Christians.

A very large segment of its clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested.\nThe widespread persecution and internecine disputes within the church hierarchy lead to the seat of [[Patriarch of Moscow]] being vacant from 1925 to 1943.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church in order to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957, about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985, fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.<ref name=Ostling/>\n\nIn the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closure and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated by the state and converted to public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. With the exception of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy, it could not instruct the faithful or evangelise the youth.

He wore the uniform number 1 for the majority of his career (1958\u20131966).\n\n==Early life==\nRichardson was the middle child of Robert Sr. and Debbie Richardson of [[Sumter, South Carolina]].

Richardson played on a local [[YMCA]]/[[Salvation Army]] team at the age of ten. Later, he played on ballclubs sponsored by the local [[Kiwanis Club]] and [[American Legion]]. On the American Legion team, Richardson's coach was [[Fred Hutchinson]], who would later manage the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when Richardson faced them in the [[1961 World Series]]. Hutchinson and Richardson became American Legion champions in 1952, Richardson's junior year of high school. Hutchinson also coached Richardson at Edmunds High School.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\n11 out of 16 [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams showed interest in Richardson, as well as the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Georgia Tech University]], which offered baseball scholarships. [[Mayo Smith]], manager of the [[Norfolk Tars]], a team in the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Piedmont League]] and an affiliate of the [[New York Yankees]], scouted Richardson for New York, as did Bill Harris.

In the 1962 World Series, he caught the final out of the 1962 Series; hardly moving from his position, he snared a screaming line drive off the bat of [[Willie McCovey]], which, if it had been two or three feet higher would have won the Series for the [[San Francisco Giants]].\n\n[[File:Bobby Richardson 1963.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Richardson in 1963.]]\nIn Game One of the [[1963 World Series]], which the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] swept in four games over the Yankees, Richardson struck out three times against [[Sandy Koufax]]\u2014his only three-strikeout game in 1,448 regular-season/World Series games. (Koufax would finish with 15 strikeouts, then a World Series single-game record.) Just that regular season, Richardson had struck out only 22 times in 630 at-bats, without ever striking out twice in one game.\n\nIn the [[1964 World Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], Richardson set a World Series record with 13 hits; this record has since been tied by [[Lou Brock]] and [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] in the [[1968 World Series|1968]] and [[1986 World Series]], respectively. However, batting against Cardinal ace [[Bob Gibson]] with the Yankees trailing 7\u20135 in the seventh and deciding game of that World Series, he popped out to [[Dal Maxvill]] for the final out of the Series. Richardson also had the dubious distinction of committing errors that affected the outcome of two games in the Series. In the sixth inning of Game Four, he mishandled [[Dick Groat]]'s ground ball for a double play that would have ended the inning with no runs scoring; the error was followed one batter later by [[Ken Boyer]]'s grand slam\u2014the four runs the Cardinals needed in defeating the Yankees 4\u20133. In the fifth inning of Game Five, he bobbled [[Curt Flood]]'s double play ground ball, which also would have ended that inning without any damage. The Cardinals eventually scored twice in the inning, then won the game 5\u20132 on [[Tim McCarver]]'s 10th inning, three-run home run.\n\n===Legacy===\nRichardson racked up 1,432 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in his career, with a lifetime [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .266, 34 [[home run]]s and 390 [[run batted in|RBI]]s. Richardson's 12-year career statistics also include 643 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] and 73 [[stolen base]]s. He also had 196 [[double (baseball)|double]]s and 37 [[triple (baseball)|triple]]s.\n\nRichardson won a [[List of Gold Glove Award winners at second base|Gold Glove at second base]] each year from 1961\u201365 (not until [[Robinson Can\u00f3]] in {{Baseball year|2010}} would another Yankee second baseman win a Gold Glove) while forming a top [[double play]] combination with [[shortstop]] and roommate [[Tony Kubek]].

They advanced all the way to the national championship game against Texas (a 5\u20131 Longhorns victory). Richardson left South Carolina after the 1976 season, finishing his tenure with a 221\u201392\u20131 record and three NCAA Tournament appearances.  Richardson is considered the father of Gamecocks baseball, and is credited with having set them on their path to becoming one of the elite college baseball programs in the NCAA still today. In the 1980s, Richardson served as the baseball coach for two seasons (1985\u201386) at [[Coastal Carolina University]] in [[Conway, South Carolina]], where he compiled a record of (61\u201338). After the 1986 season, he resigned as head coach at Coastal Carolina to replace [[Al Worthington]] as the baseball coach at [[Liberty University]]. \"I came here as athletic director under a different administration and [Chancellor] Ron [Eaglin] felt I should resign as athletic director and focus on baseball,\" Richardson explained the decision to resign, with Eaglin saying the two had disagreed on a budget for the next season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/10/sports/sports-people-richardson-moves-on.html?searchResultPosition=5|title=Sports People; Richardson Moves On|work=The New York Times|page=D-31|date=April 10, 1986|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, Nixon tried to convince Richardson to run for the [[United States Congress]]in [[South Carolina's 5th congressional district]].

His 209 hits led the [[American League]], and he stole 11 bases in 161 games. He made the AL [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team, won his second Gold Glove, and came in second in the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|AL MVP]] voting, just behind teammate [[Mickey Mantle]]. \n\nHe also led the league in at bats three times, partly because he batted early in the order and partly because he rarely missed a game, coming to be known as a workhorse. His career high was 692 at bats in 161 games in 1962.\n\nDuring the 1963 season, Richardson's father suffered a stroke in May, then died on July 17. Richardson missed 11 games during the year visiting him and helping get his affairs in order.<ref name=\"SABR\"/><ref name=\"Richardson's father\"/>\n\nThough he was just 31 following the 1966 season, Richardson retired following the year. He had made the decision the year before. \u201cI wanted to take the kids to school, help them with homework and watch or help coach their teams,\u201d he explained.<ref name=\"Baptist Courier\"/> The Yankees honored him by declaring September 17 \"Bobby Richardson Day,\" making Richardson the tenth Yankee to be honored at the stadium with a special day. \u201cHow lucky it has been for me to have been a Yankee. To God be the glory,\" he addressed the fans.<ref name=\"Baptist Courier\"/>\n\nHe had an all-time [[fielding percentage]] of .979 at second base, and six seasons with 100 or more double plays turned.\n\n===Postseason===\nRichardson won three [[World Series]] ([[1958 World Series|1958]], [[1961 World Series|1961]], [[1962 World Series|1962]]) of the seven he played with the Yankees ([[1957 World Series|1957]], 1958, [[1960 World Series|1960]], 1961, 1962, [[1963 World Series|1963]], [[1964 World Series|1964]]). In the 1962 World Series, he caught the final out of the 1962 Series; hardly moving from his position, he snared a screaming line drive off the bat of [[Willie McCovey]], which, if it had been two or three feet higher would have won the Series for the [[San Francisco Giants]].\n\n[[File:Bobby Richardson 1963.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Richardson in 1963.]]\nIn Game One of the [[1963 World Series]], which the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] swept in four games over the Yankees, Richardson struck out three times against [[Sandy Koufax]]\u2014his only three-strikeout game in 1,448 regular-season/World Series games. (Koufax would finish with 15 strikeouts, then a World Series single-game record.) Just that regular season, Richardson had struck out only 22 times in 630 at-bats, without ever striking out twice in one game.\n\nIn the [[1964 World Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], Richardson set a World Series record with 13 hits; this record has since been tied by [[Lou Brock]] and [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] in the [[1968 World Series|1968]] and [[1986 World Series]], respectively. However, batting against Cardinal ace [[Bob Gibson]] with the Yankees trailing 7\u20135 in the seventh and deciding game of that World Series, he popped out to [[Dal Maxvill]] for the final out of the Series. Richardson also had the dubious distinction of committing errors that affected the outcome of two games in the Series. In the sixth inning of Game Four, he mishandled [[Dick Groat]]'s ground ball for a double play that would have ended the inning with no runs scoring; the error was followed one batter later by [[Ken Boyer]]'s grand slam\u2014the four runs the Cardinals needed in defeating the Yankees 4\u20133. In the fifth inning of Game Five, he bobbled [[Curt Flood]]'s double play ground ball, which also would have ended that inning without any damage. The Cardinals eventually scored twice in the inning, then won the game 5\u20132 on [[Tim McCarver]]'s 10th inning, three-run home run.\n\n===Legacy===\nRichardson racked up 1,432 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in his career, with a lifetime [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .266, 34 [[home run]]s and 390 [[run batted in|RBI]]s. Richardson's 12-year career statistics also include 643 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] and 73 [[stolen base]]s. He also had 196 [[double (baseball)|double]]s and 37 [[triple (baseball)|triple]]s.\n\nRichardson won a [[List of Gold Glove Award winners at second base|Gold Glove at second base]] each year from 1961\u201365 (not until [[Robinson Can\u00f3]] in {{Baseball year|2010}} would another Yankee second baseman win a Gold Glove) while forming a top [[double play]] combination with [[shortstop]] and roommate [[Tony Kubek]]. With the light-hitting but superb-fielding Yankee [[third baseman]] [[Clete Boyer]], Richardson and Kubek gave the Yankees arguably the best defensive infield in baseball.<ref>{{cite web|last=Madden|first=Bill|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/clete-boyer-yanks-3rd-man-article-1.221914|title=Clete Boyer, Yanks' 3rd man|work=The New York Daily News|date=June 5, 2007|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Ben|agency=Associated Press|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2007/06/05/clete_boyer_at_70_3d_baseman_for_yanks_was_brilliant_fielder/|title=Clete Boyer, at 70; 3d baseman for Yanks was brilliant fielder|work=boston.com|date=June 5, 2007|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> His most famous defensive play came at the end of the [[1962 World Series]], mentioned below, when Richardson made a clutch catch off a [[Willie McCovey]] line drive that prevented [[Willie Mays]] and [[Matty Alou]] from scoring the runs that would have beaten the Yankees and given the Series to the [[San Francisco Giants]].\n\nRichardson was also known for his ability to [[Contact hitter|make contact]].

He would often pitch batting practice and drive the team bus for events. Richardson also tried to perform recruiting for the school but delegated the responsibility to others after he figured out \"I wasn't going after the good players.\"<ref name=\"finah\">{{cite web|last=Keith|first=Larry|url=https://vault.si.com/vault/1975/06/02/nothin-could-be-finah|title=Nothin', could be finah|work=Sports Illustrated|date=June 2, 1975|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}</ref> Under Richardson, Larry Keith of ''Sports Illustrated'' wrote, \"South Carolina rarely bunts, often hits-and-runs and is always looking for the big inning.\"<ref name=\"finah\"/> Richardson led the Gamecocks to their first NCAA Tournament appearance in 1974, which set the stage for what would happen a year later in 1975 when South Carolina posted a 51\u20136\u20131 record and made the College World Series for the first time ever.  They advanced all the way to the national championship game against Texas (a 5\u20131 Longhorns victory). Richardson left South Carolina after the 1976 season, finishing his tenure with a 221\u201392\u20131 record and three NCAA Tournament appearances.  Richardson is considered the father of Gamecocks baseball, and is credited with having set them on their path to becoming one of the elite college baseball programs in the NCAA still today. In the 1980s, Richardson served as the baseball coach for two seasons (1985\u201386) at [[Coastal Carolina University]] in [[Conway, South Carolina]], where he compiled a record of (61\u201338). After the 1986 season, he resigned as head coach at Coastal Carolina to replace [[Al Worthington]] as the baseball coach at [[Liberty University]]. \"I came here as athletic director under a different administration and [Chancellor] Ron [Eaglin] felt I should resign as athletic director and focus on baseball,\" Richardson explained the decision to resign, with Eaglin saying the two had disagreed on a budget for the next season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/10/sports/sports-people-richardson-moves-on.html?searchResultPosition=5|title=Sports People; Richardson Moves On|work=The New York Times|page=D-31|date=April 10, 1986|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, Nixon tried to convince Richardson to run for the [[United States Congress]]in [[South Carolina's 5th congressional district]]. Later, a private poll indicated he was the favorite.<ref name=\"finah\"/> Two years later, he did run for the seat as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], losing to incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Kenneth Lamar Holland|Kenneth Holland]] by a narrow margin. Holland was aided by the strength of [[Jimmy Carter]]'s winning campaign in South Carolina to hold off Richardson by a tally of 66,073 (51.4%) to 62,095 (48.3%). His campaign was supported by former baseball players [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Ted Williams]], [[Bob Feller]], and [[Wilmer Mizell|Wilmer \"Vinegar Bend\" Mizell]] among others.  Richardson's old friend, Yankee shortstop [[Tony Kubek]], declined to campaign for him because Kubek was a Democrat.<ref>{{cite book |title=October 1964 |last= Halberstam |first=David |authorlink= |year=1995 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |location= |isbn= 0-449-98367-6 |pages=366\u2013367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZ7sUkp5eBcC&lpg=PP1&dq=october%201964&pg=PA366#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref>\n\nRichardson is a [[born-again Christian]].

Under Hitler's rule, Germany became a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]] where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government. The Third Reich name, meaning Third Realm or Third Empire, alluded to the Nazis' perception that Nazi Germany was the successor of the earlier [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] (800\u20131806) and [[German Empire|German]] (1871\u20131918) empires. The regime ended after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Victory in Europe Day|defeated Germany]] in May 1945, [[End of World War II in Europe|ending World War II in Europe]].\n\nHitler was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by the [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], [[Paul von Hindenburg]], on 30 January 1933. The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national [[1934 German referendum|referendum held 19 August 1934]] confirmed Hitler as sole ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became the highest law. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the [[Great Depression]], the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a [[mixed economy]]. Using [[deficit spending]], the regime undertook extensive public works, including the construction of ''[[Reichsautobahn|Autobahnen]]'' (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.\n\n[[Racism]], especially [[antisemitism]], was a central ideological feature of the regime. The [[Germanic peoples]] were considered by the Nazis to be the [[master race]], the purest branch of the [[Aryan race]]. Discrimination and persecution against [[Jews]] and [[Romani people]] began in earnest after the seizure of power. The first [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] were established in March 1933. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, and liberals, socialists, and communists were killed, imprisoned, or exiled. Christian churches and citizens that [[German resistance to Nazism|opposed Hitler's rule]] were oppressed and many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on [[scientific racism|racial biology]], population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women [[Women in Nazi Germany|were curtailed]]. Recreation and tourism were organised via the [[Strength Through Joy]] program, and the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] showcased Germany on the international stage. [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.\n\nThe Nazi regime dominated neighbours through military threats in the years leading up to war. Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. It seized [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] and almost all of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in 1938 and 1939. Germany signed [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|a non-aggression pact]] with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, launching [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]]. By early 1941, Germany controlled much of Europe. ''[[Reichskommissariat]]s'' took control of conquered areas and a [[General Government|German administration]] was established in the remainder of Poland. Germany exploited the raw materials and labour of both its occupied territories and its allies. ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' paramilitary [[death squad]]s inside the occupied territories conducted mass killings of millions of Jews and [[Holocaust victims|other peoples]] deemed undesirable by the state. Many others were imprisoned, [[Extermination through labour|worked to death]], or murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s. This [[genocide]] is known as [[the Holocaust]].\n\nWhile the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the Soviet Union in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the [[United States]] into the war meant the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (German armed forces) lost the initiative on the Eastern Front in 1943 and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the pre-1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the [[Axis powers]] were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of France]], Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the [[Allies of World War II|other Allies]] from the west, and capitulated in May 1945. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of [[denazification]] and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the [[Nuremberg trials]].\n\n== Name ==\n{{Further|Reich}}\nThe official name of the state was ''Deutsches Reich'' from 1933 to 1943 and ''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich'' from 1943 to 1945, while common English terms are \"Nazi Germany\" and \"Third Reich\". The latter, adopted by [[Nazi propaganda]] as ''Drittes Reich'', was first used in ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]'', a 1923 book by [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]]. The book counted the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (962\u20131806) as the first [[Reich]] and the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918) as the second.{{sfn|Lauryssens|1999|p=102}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Further|Adolf Hitler's rise to power}}\nGermany was known as the [[Weimar Republic]] during the years 1919 to 1933. It was a [[republic]] with a [[semi-presidential system]]. The Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]], political extremism (including violence from left- and right-wing paramilitaries), contentious relationships with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied victors]] of [[World War I]], and a series of failed attempts at coalition government by divided political parties.{{sfn|Childers|2017|pp=22\u201323, 35, 48, 124\u2013130, 152, 168\u2013169, 203\u2013204, 225\u2013226}} Severe setbacks to the German economy began after World War I ended, partly because of [[World War I reparations|reparations payments]] required under the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos, and food riots.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=103\u2013108}} When the government defaulted on their reparations payments in January 1923, French troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied German industrial areas]] along the [[Ruhr]] and widespread civil unrest followed.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nThe [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'', NSDAP; Nazi Party) was founded in 1920. It was the renamed successor of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) formed one year earlier, and one of several [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political parties then active in Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=170\u2013171}} The NSDAP party platform included destruction of the Weimar Republic, rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, radical [[antisemitism]], and anti-[[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=85}} They promised a strong central government, increased ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of [[Jews]], who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the [[V\u00f6lkisch movement|''V\u00f6lkisch'' movement]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=81}} The party, especially its paramilitary organisation ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA; Storm Detachment; Brownshirts), used physical violence to advance their political position, disrupting the meetings of rival organisations and attacking their members (as well as Jewish people) on the streets.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=180\u2013181}} Such far-right armed groups were common in [[Bavaria]], and were tolerated by the sympathetic far-right state government of [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=181, 189}}\n\nWhen the stock market in the United States [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|crashed on 24 October 1929]], the effect in Germany was dire.{{sfn|Childers|2017|p=103}} Millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the NSDAP prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to strengthen the economy and provide jobs.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=136\u2013137}} Many voters decided the NSDAP was capable of restoring order, quelling civil unrest, and improving Germany's international reputation. After the [[German federal election, July 1932|federal election of 1932]], the NSDAP was the largest party in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], holding 230 seats with 37.4 percent of the popular vote.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=87}}\n\n== History ==\n{{See|History of Germany}}\n[[File:Hitler portrait crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]] became Germany's head of state, with the title of ''[[F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler]]'', in 1934.]]\n\n=== Nazi seizure of power ===\n{{Main|Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931\u20131933)}}\nAlthough the Nazis won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority. Hitler therefore led a short-lived coalition government formed with the [[German National People's Party]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=293, 302}} Under pressure from politicians, industrialists, and the business community, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler as [[Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' (\"seizure of power\").{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nOn the night of 27 February 1933, the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag building was set afire]]. [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], a Dutch communist, was found guilty of starting the blaze. Hitler proclaimed that the arson marked the start of a communist uprising. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], imposed on 28 February 1933, rescinded most civil liberties, including rights of assembly and freedom of the press.

The [[Bank of France]] was forced to provide 4.5&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in \"credits\" to Germany, while a further 500,000 Reichsmarks were assessed against Vichy France by the Nazis in the form of \"fees\" and other miscellaneous charges. The Nazis exploited other conquered nations in a similar way. After the war, the [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey]] concluded Germany had obtained 104&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in the form of occupation costs and other wealth transfers from occupied Europe, including two-thirds of the [[gross domestic product]] of Belgium and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=943}}\n\nNazi plunder included private and public art collections, artefacts, precious metals, books, and personal possessions.

G\u00f6ring, having stripped almost all of occupied Poland of its artworks within six months of Germany's invasion, ultimately grew a collection valued at over 50&nbsp;million Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=945}} In 1940, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] was established to loot artwork and cultural material from public and private collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. France saw the greatest extent of Nazi plunder. Some 26,000 railroad cars of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France.{{sfn|Manvell|2011|pp=283\u2013285}} By January 1941, Rosenberg estimated the looted treasures from France to be valued at over one billion Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=946}} In addition, soldiers looted or purchased goods such as produce and clothing\u2014items, which were becoming harder to obtain in Germany\u2014for shipment home.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=334}}\n\nGoods and raw materials were also taken. In France, an estimated {{convert|9000000|t|LT ST}} of [[cereal]]s were seized during the course of the war, including 75 percent of its oats. In addition, 80 percent of the country's oil and 74 percent of its steel production were taken. The valuation of this loot is estimated to be 184.5&nbsp;billion [[franc]]s. In Poland, Nazi plunder of raw materials began even before the German invasion had concluded.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=944}}\n\nFollowing Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was also plundered.

During the course of the German occupation, some 12&nbsp;million pigs and 13&nbsp;million sheep were taken. The value of this plunder is estimated at 4&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks.

Under Hitler's rule, Germany became a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]] where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government. The Third Reich name, meaning Third Realm or Third Empire, alluded to the Nazis' perception that Nazi Germany was the successor of the earlier [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] (800\u20131806) and [[German Empire|German]] (1871\u20131918) empires. The regime ended after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Victory in Europe Day|defeated Germany]] in May 1945, [[End of World War II in Europe|ending World War II in Europe]].\n\nHitler was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by the [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], [[Paul von Hindenburg]], on 30 January 1933. The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national [[1934 German referendum|referendum held 19 August 1934]] confirmed Hitler as sole ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became the highest law. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the [[Great Depression]], the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a [[mixed economy]]. Using [[deficit spending]], the regime undertook extensive public works, including the construction of ''[[Reichsautobahn|Autobahnen]]'' (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.\n\n[[Racism]], especially [[antisemitism]], was a central ideological feature of the regime. The [[Germanic peoples]] were considered by the Nazis to be the [[master race]], the purest branch of the [[Aryan race]]. Discrimination and persecution against [[Jews]] and [[Romani people]] began in earnest after the seizure of power. The first [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] were established in March 1933. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, and liberals, socialists, and communists were killed, imprisoned or exiled. Christian churches and citizens that [[German resistance to Nazism|opposed Hitler's rule]] were oppressed and many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on [[scientific racism|racial biology]], population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women [[Women in Nazi Germany|were curtailed]]. Recreation and tourism were organised via the [[Strength Through Joy]] program, and the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] showcased Germany on the international stage. [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] made effective use of film, mass rallies and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.\n\nThe Nazi regime dominated neighbours through military threats in the years leading up to war. Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. It seized [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] and almost all of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in 1938 and 1939. Germany signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, launching [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]]. By early 1941, Germany controlled much of Europe. ''[[Reichskommissariat]]s'' took control of conquered areas and a [[General Government|German administration]] was established in the remainder of Poland. Germany exploited the raw materials and labour of both its occupied territories and its allies. ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' paramilitary [[death squad]]s inside the occupied territories conducted mass killings of millions of Jews and [[Holocaust victims|other peoples]] deemed undesirable by the state. Many others were imprisoned, [[Extermination through labour|worked to death]] or murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s. This [[genocide]] is known as [[the Holocaust]].\n\nWhile the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the Soviet Union in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the [[United States]] into the war meant the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (German armed forces) lost the initiative on the Eastern Front in 1943 and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the pre-1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the [[Axis powers]] were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of France]], Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the [[Allies of World War II|other Allies]] from the west, and capitulated in May 1945. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of [[denazification]] and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the [[Nuremberg trials]].\n\n== Name ==\n{{Further|Reich}}\nThe official name of the state was ''Deutsches Reich'' from 1933 to 1943 and ''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich'' from 1943 to 1945, while common English terms are \"Nazi Germany\" and \"Third Reich\". The latter, adopted by [[Nazi propaganda]] as ''Drittes Reich'', was first used in ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]'', a 1923 book by [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]]. The book counted the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (962\u20131806) as the first [[Reich]] and the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918) as the second.{{sfn|Lauryssens|1999|p=102}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Further|Adolf Hitler's rise to power}}\nGermany was known as the [[Weimar Republic]] during the years 1919 to 1933. It was a [[republic]] with a [[semi-presidential system]]. The Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]], political extremism (including violence from left- and right-wing paramilitaries), contentious relationships with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied victors]] of [[World War I]], and a series of failed attempts at coalition government by divided political parties.{{sfn|Childers|2017|pp=22\u201323, 35, 48, 124\u2013130, 152, 168\u2013169, 203\u2013204, 225\u2013226}} Severe setbacks to the German economy began after World War I ended, partly because of [[World War I reparations|reparations payments]] required under the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos, and food riots.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=103\u2013108}} When the government defaulted on their reparations payments in January 1923, French troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied German industrial areas]] along the [[Ruhr]] and widespread civil unrest followed.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nThe [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'', NSDAP; Nazi Party) was founded in 1920. It was the renamed successor of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) formed one year earlier, and one of several [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political parties then active in Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=170\u2013171}} The NSDAP party platform included destruction of the Weimar Republic, rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, radical [[antisemitism]], and anti-[[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=85}} They promised a strong central government, increased ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of [[Jews]], who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the [[V\u00f6lkisch movement|''V\u00f6lkisch'' movement]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=81}} The party, especially its paramilitary organisation ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA; Storm Detachment; Brownshirts), used physical violence to advance their political position, disrupting the meetings of rival organisations and attacking their members (as well as Jewish people) on the streets.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=180\u2013181}} Such far-right armed groups were common in [[Bavaria]], and were tolerated by the sympathetic far-right state government of [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=181, 189}}\n\nWhen the stock market in the United States [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|crashed on 24 October 1929]], the effect in Germany was dire.{{sfn|Childers|2017|p=103}} Millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed.

The [[Bank of France]] was forced to provide 4.5&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in \"credits\" to Germany, while a further 500,000 Reichsmarks were assessed against Vichy France by the Nazis in the form of \"fees\" and other miscellaneous charges. The Nazis exploited other conquered nations in a similar way. After the war, the [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey]] concluded Germany had obtained 104&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in the form of occupation costs and other wealth transfers from occupied Europe, including two-thirds of the [[gross domestic product]] of Belgium and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=943}}\n\nNazi plunder included private and public art collections, artefacts, precious metals, books, and personal possessions.

G\u00f6ring, having stripped almost all of occupied Poland of its artworks within six months of Germany's invasion, ultimately grew a collection valued at over 50&nbsp;million Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=945}} In 1940, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] was established to loot artwork and cultural material from public and private collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. France saw the greatest extent of Nazi plunder. Some 26,000 railroad cars of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France.{{sfn|Manvell|2011|pp=283\u2013285}} By January 1941, Rosenberg estimated the looted treasures from France to be valued at over one billion Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=946}} In addition, soldiers looted or purchased goods such as produce and clothing\u2014items, which were becoming harder to obtain in Germany\u2014for shipment home.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=334}}\n\nGoods and raw materials were also taken. In France, an estimated {{convert|9000000|t|LT ST}} of [[cereal]]s were seized during the course of the war, including 75 percent of its oats. In addition, 80 percent of the country's oil and 74 percent of its steel production were taken. The valuation of this loot is estimated to be 184.5&nbsp;billion [[franc]]s. In Poland, Nazi plunder of raw materials began even before the German invasion had concluded.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=944}}\n\nFollowing Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was also plundered.

During the course of the German occupation, some 12&nbsp;million pigs and 13&nbsp;million sheep were taken. The value of this plunder is estimated at 4&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks.
