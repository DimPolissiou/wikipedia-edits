Chloroquine-resistant cells efflux chloroquine at 40 times the rate of chloroquine-sensitive cells; the related mutations trace back to transmembrane proteins of the digestive vacuole, including sets of critical mutations in the ''P. falciparum'' chloroquine resistance transporter (''PfCRT'') gene.

They effectively neutralize the drug via a mechanism that drains chloroquine away from the digestive vacuole. Chloroquine-resistant cells efflux chloroquine at 40 times the rate of chloroquine-sensitive cells; the related mutations trace back to transmembrane proteins of the digestive vacuole, including sets of critical mutations in the ''P. falciparum'' chloroquine resistance transporter (''PfCRT'') gene.

By 1909, Liberia faced serious external threats to its sovereignty from the European colonial powers over unpaid foreign loans and annexation of its borderlands.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/liberia.htm |title=Liberia |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-19}}</ref>\n\nPresident [[William Howard Taft]] devoted a portion of his First Annual Message to Congress (December 7, 1909) to the Liberian question, noting the close historical ties between the two countries that gave an opening for a wider intervention:\n\n:\"It will be remembered that the interest of the United States in the Republic of Liberia springs from the historical fact of the foundation of the Republic by the colonization of American citizens of the African race. In an early treaty with Liberia there is a provision under which the United States may be called upon for advice or assistance. Pursuant to this provision and in the spirit of the moral relationship of the United States to Liberia, that Republic last year asked this Government to lend assistance in the solution of certain of their national problems, and hence the Commission was sent across the ocean on two cruisers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/LiteraryDigest-1909dec25-01167 |title=\"Our Responsibility in Liberia\", The Literary Digest, Friday, December 25, 1909 |publisher=UNZ.org |date=1909-12-25 |accessdate=2015-05-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912 the U.S. arranged a 40-year international loan of $1.7 million, against which Liberia had to agree to four Western powers (America, Britain, France and Germany) controlling Liberian Government revenues for the next 14 years, until 1926. American administration of the border police also stabilized the frontier with Sierra Leone and checked French ambitions to annex more Liberian territory. The American navy also established a coaling station in Liberia, cementing its presence.

This first step was augmented with treaties of arbitration and conciliation signed at Addis Ababa 26 January 1929. These formal relations included a grant of [[Most Favored Nation]] status, and were good up to the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian occupation]] in 1935.\n[[File:Haille Sellasse and Richard Nixon 1969.png|thumb|Emperor Haille Sellasse and President Nixon in 1969.]]\n\nItaly invaded and conquered Ethiopia 1935, and evaded League of Nations sanctions. The United States was one of only five countries which refused to recognize the Italian conquest. During World War II, British forces expel the Italians and restored independence to Ethiopia.  In January 1944, when President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] met personally with Emperor Haile Selassie in  Egypt. The meeting both strengthened the Emperor's already strong predilection towards the United States, as well as discomforted the [[Ethiopia-United Kingdom relations|British]] who had been at odds with the Ethiopian government over the disposition of [[Eritrea]] and the [[Ogaden]].<ref>John Spencer, ''Ethiopia at Bay: A personal account of the Haile Selassie years'' (Algonac: Reference Publications, 1984), pp. 159f.</ref> In the 1950s, Ethiopia became a minor player in the Cold War after signing a series of treaties with the United States, and receiving  $282 million in military assistance and $366 million in [[Foreign aid to Ethiopia|economic assistance]] in [[Agriculture in Ethiopia|agriculture]], [[Education in Ethiopia|education]], public health, and [[Transport in Ethiopia|transportation]].  In 1957, Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] visited Ethiopia and called it \"one of the United States' most stalwart and consistent allies\".<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=03dRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vwAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6537,4720048&dq=united+states+egypt+vice+president&hl=en U.S. Requests for Ethiopian Bases Pushed] ''Toledo Blade'', March 13, 1957</ref>\n\nThe economic aid came through Washington's \"Point Four\" program and served as a model for American assistance to the newly independent African nations.  The original goal of \"Point Four\" was containing the spread of communism, which was not a major threat in Africa in the 1950s. More broadly it served as a political project to convince Africans that it was to their long-term interest to side with the West. The program  sought to improve social and economic conditions without interfering with existing political or social order.<ref>{{cite book|author=Amanda Kay McVety|title=Enlightened Aid: U. S.

Small numbers of Egyptians converted to Christianity. Influential circles in the United States gained an increased awareness of the social and economic conditions in Egypt. One major impact was bringing modern educational methods to Egypt, which the local officials and British had largely ignored. The flagship institution was the  [[The American University in Cairo]], which offered all classes in Arabic, and practiced flexible methods that were adopted in Egyptian-sponsored schools when they began to appear in the 20th century.<ref>Sahair ElCalamawy, \"The American influence on education in Egypt,\" in Allen F. Davis, ed., ''For Better or Worse: The American influence in the world'' (1981)</ref>\n\nOfficial Modern relations were established in 1922 when the United States recognized Egypt's independence from a protectorate status of the United Kingdom. Britain nevertheless controlled Egyptian foreign affairs, and the United States rarely had direct connections with the Egyptian government. In 1956, the U.S. was alarmed at the closer ties between Egypt and the Soviet Union, and prepared the [[OMEGA Memorandum]] as a stick to reduce the regional power of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. When Egypt recognized [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], the U.S. ended talks about funding the [[Aswan Dam]], a high prestige project much desired by Egypt. The dam was later built by the Soviet Union. When Nasser nationalized the [[Suez Canal]] in 1956, the [[Suez Crisis]] erupted with Britain and France invading to retake control of the canal. Using heavy diplomatic and economic pressure, the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] forced Britain and France to withdraw soon. A major result was that the United States largely replaced Great Britain in terms of regional influence in the Middle East.<ref>Peter L. Hahn, ''The United States, Great Britain and Egypt, 1945-1956'' (1991).</ref>\n\n===Others===\nIn 1901, the [[Tuskegee Institute]], a state college in Alabama directed by the national Black leader [[Booker T. Washington]], sent experts to the German colony of Togo in West Africa. the goal was to introduce modern agricultural technology in order to modernize the colony, basing its economy on cotton exports.<ref>Andrew  Zimmerman, 'Alabama in Africa: Booker T. Washington, the German empire, and the globalization of the New South'' (Princeton UP, 2010).</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nVichy France controlled much of North Africa. with the British based in Egypt pushing back German and Italian forces, the United States and Britain launched [[Operation Torch]] with amphibious landings in Morocco  and Algeria in November 1942. After brief resistance, the Vichy French forces switch sides and began to collaborate with the Allies. After some delays, the eastern and western Allied forces met up in Tunisia, and forced the surrender the main German and Italian armies. The Americans then moved on to an invasion of Sicily and in southern Italy.<ref>William B. Breuer, ''Operation Torch: The Allied Gamble to Invade North Africa'' (1985).</ref>\n\nNumerous locations in Africa were used in moving supplies that were either flown in via Brazil or brought in by ship. supplies were transshipped across Africa and moved through Egypt to supply the Soviet Union.<ref>Arnold Hague, '' The Allied Convoy System 1939\u20131945'' (2000).</ref>\n\n==Decolonization, 1951 to 1960==\nAll the colonial powers engaged in [[decolonization]] in the 1950s, starting with Libya 1951, Sudan in 1954, Morocco and Tunisia 1956, and Ghana in 1957. In 1958 President Eisenhower's State Department created the Bureau of African Affairs under the [[Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs]] to deal with sub- Sahara Africa. Countries in North Africa were under the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. [[G. Mennen Williams]], a former Democratic governor of Michigan, was the assistant secretary of state under President John F. Kennedy.  Williams actively promoted and encouraged decolonization. The Kennedy administration also launched the Peace Corps, which sent thousands of young American volunteers to serve in local villages. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) started providing cash economic assistance, and the Pentagon provided funds and munitions for the local armies. Euphoria ended when the Congo Crisis of the 1960s indicated very large scale instability.\n\n==Kennedy-Johnson, 1961-1969==\nWhereas Eisenhower had largely neglected Africa, President John F. Kennedy took an aggressive activist approach. Kennedy was alarmed by the implications of Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev's 1961 speech that proclaimed the USSR's intention to intervene in anticolonial struggles around the world. Since most nations in Europe, Latin America, and Asia had already chosen sides, Kennedy and Krushchev both looked to Africa as the next Cold War battleground. Under the leadership of [[S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9]], the former French colony of [[History of Guinea|Guinea]] in West Africa proclaimed its independence in 1958 and immediately sought foreign aid. Eisenhower was hostile to Tour\u00e9, so the African nation quickly turned to the Soviet Union--making it the Kremlin's first success story in Africa. However Kennedy and his Peace Corps director [[Sargent Shriver]] tried even harder than Khrushchev. By 1963 Guinea had shifted away from Moscow into a closer friendship with Washington.  Kennedy had a broad vision that encompassed all of Africa; he opened up the White House to receive eleven African heads of state in 1961, ten in 1962, and another seven in 1963.\n<ref>Philip E.

However, there are multiple explanations available.<ref>Franck Gerits, \"Jimmy Carter in Africa\" ''History'' (2017) 102#351, pp 545-547.</ref>  The orthodox interpretation posits Carter as a dreamy star-eyed idealist. Revisionists said that did not matter nearly as much as the intense rivalry between dovish Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]] and hawkish National Security Adviser [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]. Vance lost nearly all the battles, and finally resigned in disgust.<ref>Donna Jackson, ''Jimmy Carter and the Horn of Africa: Cold War Policy in Ethiopia and Somalia'' 2007)</ref>  Meanwhile there are now post-revisionist historians who blame his failures on his confused management style and his refusal to make tough decisions.<ref>Scott Kaufman, ''Plans Unraveled: The Foreign Policy of the Carter Administration,'' (2008)).</ref> Along post-revisionist lines, Nancy Mitchell in a monumental book depicts Carter as a decisive but ineffective Cold Warrior, who, nevertheless had some successes because Soviet incompetence was even worse.<ref>Nancy Mitchell, ''Jimmy Carter in Africa: Race and the Cold War'' (2016) p 688.</ref>\n\n==Reagan-Bush administrations, 1981-1993==\nThe [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan]], starting in January 1981, decided that the Carter administration had largely failed in Africa, and sharply changed directions. It abandon the Carter in emphasis on human rights, and emphasized anti-communism. This meant reversals of policies in South Africa and Angola, and changed the relationships with Ethiopia and Libya, which were pro-Soviet.\n\nCarter's policy was to denounce and try to end the apartheid policies in South Africa and Angola,  whereby small white minorities had full control of government. Under the new conservative administration a more conciliatory approach was taken by the Assistant Secretary of State [[Chester Crocker]].  He rejected confrontational approaches, and called for \"Constructive engagement\"  Crocker was highly critical of the outgoing Carter administration for its apparent hostility to the white minority government in South Africa, by acquiescing in the United Nations Security Council's imposition of a mandatory arms embargo ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 418|UNSCR 418/77]]) and the UN's demand for the end of South Africa's illegal occupation of [[Namibia]] ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 435|UNSCR 435/78]]). Crocker came up with a complex multinational peace plan, that he struggled to achieve for eight years. the most essential provision required the removal of [[Cuba Angola relations|Cuba's large, well-armed forces]] from [[Cuba in Angola|Angola]].  The United States would then quit funding the anti-Marxist forces led by [[Jonas Savimbi]], South Africa would pull out of Southwest Africa, allowing Namibia to become independent. And finally the white rulers in South Africa would remain in power but relax their restrictions on the African National Congress. Crocker was finally successful in 1988, and during the George HW Bush administration, 1989 to 1993, the goals were realized.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Freeman Jr.|first1=Chas.

In an early treaty with Liberia there is a provision under which the United States may be called upon for advice or assistance. Pursuant to this provision and in the spirit of the moral relationship of the United States to Liberia, that Republic last year asked this Government to lend assistance in the solution of certain of their national problems, and hence the Commission was sent across the ocean on two cruisers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/LiteraryDigest-1909dec25-01167 |title=\"Our Responsibility in Liberia\", The Literary Digest, Friday, December 25, 1909 |publisher=UNZ.org |date=1909-12-25 |accessdate=2015-05-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912 the U.S. arranged a 40-year international loan of $1.7 million, against which Liberia had to agree to four Western powers (America, Britain, France and Germany) controlling Liberian Government revenues for the next 14 years, until 1926.

This first step was augmented with treaties of arbitration and conciliation signed at Addis Ababa 26 January 1929. These formal relations included a grant of [[Most Favored Nation]] status, and were good up to the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian occupation]] in 1935.\n[[File:Haille Sellasse and Richard Nixon 1969.png|thumb|Emperor Haille Sellasse and President Nixon in 1969.]]\n\nItaly invaded and conquered Ethiopia 1935, and evaded League of Nations sanctions. The United States was one of only five countries which refused to recognize the Italian conquest. During World War II, British forces expel the Italians and restored independence to Ethiopia.  In January 1944, when President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] met personally with Emperor Haile Selassie in  Egypt. The meeting both strengthened the Emperor's already strong predilection towards the United States, as well as discomforted the [[Ethiopia-United Kingdom relations|British]] who had been at odds with the Ethiopian government over the disposition of [[Eritrea]] and the [[Ogaden]].<ref>John Spencer, ''Ethiopia at Bay: A personal account of the Haile Selassie years'' (Algonac: Reference Publications, 1984), pp. 159f.</ref> In the 1950s, Ethiopia became a minor player in the Cold War after signing a series of treaties with the United States, and receiving  $282 million in military assistance and $366 million in [[Foreign aid to Ethiopia|economic assistance]] in [[Agriculture in Ethiopia|agriculture]], [[Education in Ethiopia|education]], public health, and [[Transport in Ethiopia|transportation]].  In 1957, Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] visited Ethiopia and called it \"one of the United States' most stalwart and consistent allies\".<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=03dRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vwAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6537,4720048&dq=united+states+egypt+vice+president&hl=en U.S. Requests for Ethiopian Bases Pushed] ''Toledo Blade'', March 13, 1957</ref>\n\nThe economic aid came through Washington's \"Point Four\" program and served as a model for American assistance to the newly independent African nations.  The original goal of \"Point Four\" was containing the spread of communism, which was not a major threat in Africa in the 1950s. More broadly it served as a political project to convince Africans that it was to their long-term interest to side with the West. The program  sought to improve social and economic conditions without interfering with existing political or social order.<ref>{{cite book|author=Amanda Kay McVety|title=Enlightened Aid: U. S.

Small numbers of Egyptians converted to Christianity. Influential circles in the United States gained an increased awareness of the social and economic conditions in Egypt. One major impact was bringing modern educational methods to Egypt, which the local officials and British had largely ignored. The flagship institution was the  [[The American University in Cairo]], which offered all classes in Arabic, and practiced flexible methods that were adopted in Egyptian-sponsored schools when they began to appear in the 20th century.<ref>Sahair ElCalamawy, \"The American influence on education in Egypt,\" in Allen F. Davis, ed., ''For Better or Worse: The American influence in the world'' (1981)</ref>\n\nOfficial Modern relations were established in 1922 when the United States recognized Egypt's independence from a protectorate status of the United Kingdom. Britain nevertheless controlled Egyptian foreign affairs, and the United States rarely had direct connections with the Egyptian government. In 1956, the U.S. was alarmed at the closer ties between Egypt and the Soviet Union, and prepared the [[OMEGA Memorandum]] as a stick to reduce the regional power of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. When Egypt recognized [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], the U.S. ended talks about funding the [[Aswan Dam]], a high prestige project much desired by Egypt. The dam was later built by the Soviet Union. When Nasser nationalized the [[Suez Canal]] in 1956, the [[Suez Crisis]] erupted with Britain and France invading to retake control of the canal. Using heavy diplomatic and economic pressure, the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] forced Britain and France to withdraw soon. A major result was that the United States largely replaced Great Britain in terms of regional influence in the Middle East.<ref>Peter L. Hahn, ''The United States, Great Britain and Egypt, 1945-1956'' (1991).</ref>\n\n===Others===\nIn 1901, the [[Tuskegee Institute]], a state college in Alabama directed by the national Black leader [[Booker T. Washington]], sent experts to the German colony of Togo in West Africa. the goal was to introduce modern agricultural technology in order to modernize the colony, basing its economy on cotton exports.<ref>Andrew  Zimmerman, 'Alabama in Africa: Booker T. Washington, the German empire, and the globalization of the New South'' (Princeton UP, 2010).</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nVichy France controlled much of North Africa. with the British based in Egypt pushing back German and Italian forces, the United States and Britain launched [[Operation Torch]] with amphibious landings in Morocco  and Algeria in November 1942. After brief resistance, the Vichy French forces switch sides and began to collaborate with the Allies. After some delays, the eastern and western Allied forces met up in Tunisia, and forced the surrender the main German and Italian armies. The Americans then moved on to an invasion of Sicily and in southern Italy.<ref>William B. Breuer, ''Operation Torch: The Allied Gamble to Invade North Africa'' (1985).</ref>\n\nNumerous locations in Africa were used in moving supplies that were either flown in via Brazil or brought in by ship. supplies were transshipped across Africa and moved through Egypt to supply the Soviet Union.<ref>Arnold Hague, '' The Allied Convoy System 1939\u20131945'' (2000).</ref>\n\n==Decolonization, 1951 to 1960==\nAll the colonial powers engaged in [[decolonization]] in the 1950s, starting with Libya 1951, Sudan in 1954, Morocco and Tunisia 1956, and Ghana in 1957. In 1958 President Eisenhower's State Department created the Bureau of African Affairs under the [[Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs]] to deal with sub- Sahara Africa. Countries in North Africa were under the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. [[G. Mennen Williams]], a former Democratic governor of Michigan, was the assistant secretary of state under President John F. Kennedy.  Williams actively promoted and encouraged decolonization. The Kennedy administration also launched the Peace Corps, which sent thousands of young American volunteers to serve in local villages. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) started providing cash economic assistance, and the Pentagon provided funds and munitions for the local armies. Euphoria ended when the Congo Crisis of the 1960s indicated very large scale instability.\n\n==Kennedy-Johnson, 1961-1969==\nWhereas Eisenhower had largely neglected Africa, President John F. Kennedy took an aggressive activist approach. Kennedy was alarmed by the implications of Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev's 1961 speech that proclaimed the USSR's intention to intervene in anticolonial struggles around the world. Since most nations in Europe, Latin America, and Asia had already chosen sides, Kennedy and Krushchev both looked to Africa as the next Cold War battleground. Under the leadership of [[S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9]], the former French colony of [[History of Guinea|Guinea]] in West Africa proclaimed its independence in 1958 and immediately sought foreign aid. Eisenhower was hostile to Tour\u00e9, so the African nation quickly turned to the Soviet Union--making it the Kremlin's first success story in Africa. However Kennedy and his Peace Corps director [[Sargent Shriver]] tried even harder than Khrushchev. By 1963 Guinea had shifted away from Moscow into a closer friendship with Washington.  Kennedy had a broad vision that encompassed all of Africa; he opened up the White House to receive eleven African heads of state in 1961, ten in 1962, and another seven in 1963.\n<ref>Philip E.

However, there are multiple explanations available.<ref>Franck Gerits, \"Jimmy Carter in Africa\" ''History'' (2017) 102#351, pp 545-547.</ref>  The orthodox interpretation posits Carter as a dreamy star-eyed idealist. Revisionists said that did not matter nearly as much as the intense rivalry between dovish Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]] and hawkish National Security Adviser [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]. Vance lost nearly all the battles, and finally resigned in disgust.<ref>Donna Jackson, ''Jimmy Carter and the Horn of Africa: Cold War Policy in Ethiopia and Somalia'' 2007)</ref>  Meanwhile there are now post-revisionist historians who blame his failures on his confused management style and his refusal to make tough decisions.<ref>Scott Kaufman, ''Plans Unraveled: The Foreign Policy of the Carter Administration,'' (2008)).</ref> Along post-revisionist lines, Nancy Mitchell in a monumental book depicts Carter as a decisive but ineffective Cold Warrior, who, nevertheless had some successes because Soviet incompetence was even worse.<ref>Nancy Mitchell, ''Jimmy Carter in Africa: Race and the Cold War'' (2016) p 688.</ref>\n\n==Reagan-Bush administrations, 1981-1993==\nThe [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan]], starting in January 1981, decided that the Carter administration had largely failed in Africa, and sharply changed directions. It abandon the Carter in emphasis on human rights, and emphasized anti-communism. This meant reversals of policies in South Africa and Angola, and changed the relationships with Ethiopia and Libya, which were pro-Soviet.\n\nCarter's policy was to denounce and try to end the apartheid policies in South Africa and Angola,  whereby small white minorities had full control of government. Under the new conservative administration a more conciliatory approach was taken by the Assistant Secretary of State [[Chester Crocker]].  He rejected confrontational approaches, and called for \"Constructive engagement\"  Crocker was highly critical of the outgoing Carter administration for its apparent hostility to the white minority government in South Africa, by acquiescing in the United Nations Security Council's imposition of a mandatory arms embargo ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 418|UNSCR 418/77]]) and the UN's demand for the end of South Africa's illegal occupation of [[Namibia]] ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 435|UNSCR 435/78]]). Crocker came up with a complex multinational peace plan, that he struggled to achieve for eight years. the most essential provision required the removal of [[Cuba Angola relations|Cuba's large, well-armed forces]] from [[Cuba in Angola|Angola]].  The United States would then quit funding the anti-Marxist forces led by [[Jonas Savimbi]], South Africa would pull out of Southwest Africa, allowing Namibia to become independent. And finally the white rulers in South Africa would remain in power but relax their restrictions on the African National Congress. Crocker was finally successful in 1988, and during the George HW Bush administration, 1989 to 1993, the goals were realized.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Freeman Jr.|first1=Chas.

Verve is verified end-to-end for [[type safety]] and [[memory safety]].\n\nBecause of their complexity, a holy grail of [[software verification]] has been to verify properties of operating systems. Operating systems are usually written in low-level languages, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], that provide very few guarantees. The [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/singularity/ Singularity project] took the approach of writing an operating system in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], a type-safe, memory-safe language. A weakness of this approach is that operating systems necessarily need to call lower-level code to, for instance, move the stack pointer. Verve addresses this problem by partitioning the operating system into verified assembly that is required to be low-level and a trusted interface to rest of the operating system, written in C#. There is a trusted specification that guarantees the low-level assembly code does not mess with the heap and that the high-level C# code does not mess with the stacks.\n\nVerve consists of a small ''Nucleus'', which acts as a minimal hardware abstraction layer, and a ''Kernel'', which uses primitives provided by the Nucleus to expose a more traditional interface to applications. All components of the system other than the Nucleus are written in managed C# and compiled by [[Bartok (compiler)|Bartok]] (originally developed for the [[Singularity (operating system)|Singularity]] project) into [[typed assembly language]], which is verified by a TAL checker.\n\nThe Nucleus implements a memory allocator and garbage collection, support for stack switching, and managing interrupt handlers.\nIt is written in BoogiePL, which serves as input to MSR's Boogie [[formal verification|verifier]], which proves the Nucleus correct using the [[Z3 Theorem Prover|Z3]] [[satisfiability modulo theories|SMT]] [[Automated theorem prover|solver]]. The Nucleus relies on the Kernel to implement threads, scheduling, synchronization, and to provide most interrupt handlers. Even though the Kernel is not formally verified, so, for example, a bug in scheduling could cause the system to hang, it cannot violate type or [[memory safety]], and thus cannot directly cause undefined behavior. If it attempts to make invalid requests to the Nucleus, formal verification guarantees that the Nucleus handles the situation in a [[kernel panic|controlled manner]].\n\nVerve's [[trusted computing base]] is limited to: Boogie/Z3 for verifying the Nucleus's correctness; BoogieASM for translating it into x86 assembly; the BoogiePL specification of how the Nucleus should behave; the TAL verifier; the assembler and linker; and the bootloader. Notably, neither the C# compiler/runtime nor the Bartok compiler are part of the TCB.\n\n== References ==\n* [http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/122884/pldi117-yang.pdf Safe to the Last Instruction: Automated Verification of a Type-Safe Operating System], Jean Yang and Chris Hawblitzel.
