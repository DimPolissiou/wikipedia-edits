The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.

In 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'', incorporated after receiving a franchise to operate a streetcar service.  It started operating the service on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.

In ''1''899 in order to generate additional revenues, the company purchased its first new freight locomotive and started a freight service. It would later purchase another.  The service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other businesses, including the town's post office.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and were hazardously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to the Town of Cornwall.  In 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'', incorporated after receiving a franchise to operate a streetcar service.  It started operating the service on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track. In 1897, an additional two cars were purchased.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company.''  In ''1''899 in order to generate additional revenues, the company purchased its first new freight locomotive and started a freight service. It would later purchase another.  The service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other businesses, including the town's post office.  In 1902, the company was in financial trouble and defaulted on its debt to Sun Life, giving it ownership of the company.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://trainweb.org/elso/csr-elec.htm|title=Cornwall Street Railway Light & Power Co.|last=|first=|date=|website=trainweb.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990828230041/http://trainweb.org/elso/csr-elec.htm|archive-date=1999-08-28|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10|alt=]]In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''
