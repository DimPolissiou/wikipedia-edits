[[mainland China]] as the '''June Fourth Incident''' ({{lang-zh|s=\u516d\u56db\u4e8b\u4ef6|p=li\u00f9s\u00ec sh\u00ecji\u00e0n}}, literally ''six-four incident''), were student-led [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] held in [[Tiananmen Square]] in Beijing during 1989. The popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the''' '89 Democracy Movement''' ({{lang-zh|s=\u516b\u4e5d\u6c11\u904b|p=b\u0101ji\u01d4 m\u00edny\u00f9n}}). The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared [[martial law]] and sent the military to occupy central parts of Beijing. In what became known as the '''Tiananmen Square Massacre''' ({{lang-zh|s=\u5929\u5b89\u9580\u5927\u5c60\u6bba|p=ti\u0101n'\u0101nm\u00e9n d\u00e0 t\u00fash\u0101}}), [[People's Liberation Army at the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests|troops]] with [[assault rifle]]s and [[tank]]s fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square. Estimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded.{{sfn|How Many Died|1990}}{{sfn|U.S. G.P.O.|p=445}}{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=154}}{{sfn|Kristof:Reassessing Casualties}}{{sfn|Secretary of State's}}{{sfn|Calls for Justice |2004}}\n\nSet off by the death of pro-reform Communist general secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] in April 1989, amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social changes in [[History of the People's Republic of China (1976\u201389)|post-Mao China]], the protests reflected anxieties about the country's future in the popular consciousness and among the political elite. The [[Chinese economic reform|reforms of the 1980s]] had led to a nascent [[market economy]] which benefited some people but seriously disaffected others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy,{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=216}} and restrictions on political participation. The students called for greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, [[freedom of the press]], and [[freedom of speech]], although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied.{{sfn|Lim|2014a|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfn|Nathan|2001}} At the height of the protests, about 1&nbsp;million people assembled in the Square.{{sfn|D.

Western countries imposed arms embargoes on China.{{sfn|Dube | 2014 }} The Chinese government made widespread arrests of protesters and their supporters, suppressed [[1989 Chinese protests by region|other protests around China]], expelled foreign journalists, strictly controlled coverage of the events in the domestic press, strengthened the police and internal security forces, and demoted or purged officials it deemed sympathetic to the protests.{{sfn|Miles | 1997 | p=28}} More broadly, the suppression halted the policies of liberalization in the 1980s.

Thus, the common Chinese name for the crackdown is \"June Fourth Incident\" ({{zh|c=\u516d\u56db\u4e8b\u4ef6 |p=li\u00f9s\u00ec sh\u00ecji\u00e0n}}). The nomenclature of the former is consistent with the customary names of the other two great protests that occurred in Tiananmen Square: the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919 and the [[Tiananmen Incident|April Fifth Movement]] of 1976. June Fourth refers to the day on which the People's Liberation Army cleared Tiananmen Square of protesters, although actual operations began on the evening of June 3. Names such as June Fourth Movement ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u516d\u56db\u8fd0\u52a8 |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec y\u00f9nd\u00f2ng}}) and '89 Democracy Movement ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u516b\u4e5d\u6c11\u8fd0 |p=b\u0101-ji\u01d4 m\u00edny\u00f9n}}) are used to describe the event in its entirety.\n\nOutside mainland China, and among circles critical of the crackdown within mainland China, it is commonly referred to in Chinese as June Fourth Massacre ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u516d\u56db\u5c60\u6bba |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec t\u00fash\u0101}}) and June Fourth Crackdown ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u516d\u56db\u93ae\u58d3 |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec zh\u00e8ny\u0101}}). To bypass [[internet censorship in China]], which uniformly considers all the above-mentioned names too 'Sensitive' for search engines and public forums, alternative names have sprung up to describe the events on the Internet, such as May&nbsp;35th, VIIV ([[Roman numerals]] for 6 and 4), Eight Squared (i.e. 8<sup>2</sup>=64){{sfn|China tightens information}} and 8964.<ref name=\"HKFP8964\">''[https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ Bus driver in \u20188964\u2019 massacre memento suspended for 3 months] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622185220/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ |date=June 22, 2019 }}'', June 13, 2016, [[Chantal Yuen]], [[Hong Kong Free Press]].</ref>\n\nThe [[government of the People's Republic of China]] have used numerous names for the event since 1989, gradually reducing the intensity of terminology applied.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}} As the events were unfolding, it was labelled a \"counterrevolutionary riot\", which was later changed to simply \"riot\", followed by \"political storm\" and finally the leadership settled on the more neutralized phrase \"political turmoil between the Spring and Summer of 1989\", which it uses to this day.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}}{{sfn|Day China trampled2009}}\n\nIn English, the terms Tiananmen Square Massacre, Tiananmen Square Protests or Tiananmen Square Crackdown are often used to describe the series of events. However, much of the violence in Beijing did not actually happen in Tiananmen, but outside the square along a stretch of [[Chang'an Avenue]] only a few miles long, and especially near the [[Muxidi]] area.{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=283}} The term also gives a misleading impression that demonstrations only happened in Beijing, when in fact they occurred in many cities throughout China.{{sfn|Miles|2009}}\n\n==Background==\n{{History of the People's Republic of China}}\nThe [[Cultural Revolution]] ended with chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976. The movement, spearheaded by Mao, caused severe damage to the country's originally diverse economic and social fabric. The country was mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the Communist Party itself. At the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee]] in December 1978, [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's [[Paramount leader|''de facto'' leader]]. Deng launched a comprehensive [[Chinese economic reform|program to reform the Chinese economy]]. Within several years, the country's direction entirely changed. The focus on ideological purity was replaced by a full-on drive to achieve material prosperity.\n\nTo run his reform agenda, Deng promoted his allies to top government and party posts. [[Hu Yaobang]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the Communist Party in 1982, while [[Zhao Ziyang]] was named [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], the head of government, in September 1980.\n\n===Challenges with reform===\nThe reforms aimed to decrease the role of the state in the economy and gradually introduced private forms of production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had de-collectivized and 80% of state owned enterprises were permitted to retain profits. Within a few years, production increased by leaps and bounds, and poverty was reduced substantially.\n\nWhile the reforms were generally well received by the public, concerns grew over a series of social problems that the changes brought about, including [[Corruption in China|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] by elite party bureaucrats.{{sfn|Naughton|2007| p=91}} The state-mandated pricing system, in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices stable at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, this allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices. Party bureaucrats suddenly found themselves in charge of a burgeoning state regime over economic management and enormous incentives for [[arbitrage]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=120}} Discontent over corruption reached a fever pitch with the public, and many, particularly those in the intellectual community, began to believe that only democratic reform and rule of law could act as a panacea for the country's ills.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|Chapter 5: On the Eve of the 1989 Movement}}\n\nFollowing the 1988 [[Beidaihe]] meeting, the party leadership under Deng agreed to a transition to a market-based pricing system.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} News of the relaxation of price controls triggered waves of cash withdrawals, buying and hoarding all over China.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} The government panicked and rescinded the price reforms in less than two weeks, but its impact was pronounced for much longer. Inflation soared. Official indices report that the [[Consumer Price Index]] increased 30% in Beijing between 1987 and 1988, leading to panic among salaried workers that they could no longer afford staple goods.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Moreover, in the new market economy, unprofitable [[state-owned enterprise]]s were pressured to cut costs. This threatened a vast proportion of the population which relied on the \"[[iron rice bowl]]\", i.e. a host of social benefits such as job security, medical care and subsidized housing.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}}\n\n===Social disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis===\nReformist leaders envisioned in 1978 that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=81}} Despite the opening of new universities and increased enrollment,{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased market demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=84}} The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered on the basis of [[nepotism]] and favoritism.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=89}} Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in their area of jurisdiction.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the \"Democracy Salon\" and the \"Lawn Salon\" (''C\u01ceod\u00ec Sh\u0101l\u00f3ng''), began appearing on Beijing university campuses.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=137}} These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}}\n\nAt the same time, the party's nominally socialist ideology faced a legitimacy crisis as it gradually adopted capitalist practices.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}} Private enterprise gave rise to profiteers who took advantage of lax regulations, and who often flaunted their wealth in front of those who were less well off.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Popular discontent was brewing over unfair wealth distribution. Greed, not skill, appeared to be the most crucial factor of success. There was widespread public disillusionment over the country's future. People wanted change, yet the power to define 'the correct path' continued to rest solely in the hands of the unelected government.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}}\n\nThe comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over the pace of [[marketization]] and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers (\"the right\", led by [[Hu Yaobang]]) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives (\"the left\", led by [[Chen Yun]]) said that the reforms had gone too far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. However, both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===1986 student demonstrations===\n{{Main|1986 Chinese Student Demonstrations}}\nIn mid-1986, astrophysics professor [[Fang Lizhi]] returned from a position at [[Princeton University]] and began a personal tour around universities in China; speaking about liberty, human rights, and [[separation of powers]]. Fang was part of a wider undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment, and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, were a direct result of the authoritarian political system and the rigid command economy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=64, 215}} The view that political reform was the only answer to China's on-going problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated all over the country.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}} In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems, while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}}\n\nInspired by Fang and other 'people-power' movements around the world, in December 1986, student demonstrators staged protests against the slow pace of reform. The issues were wide-ranging, and included demands for economic liberalization, democracy, and rule of law.{{sfn|Wang | 2006| pp=56\u201357}} While the protests were initially contained in [[Hefei]], where Fang lived, they quickly spread to Shanghai, Beijing and other major cities. This alarmed the central leadership, who accused the students of instigating Cultural Revolution-style turmoil.\n\nGeneral secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] was blamed for taking a soft attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives. Hu was forced to resign as general secretary on January 16, 1987. Then the party began the \"Anti-[[bourgeois liberalization]] Campaign\", taking aim at Hu, political liberalization and Western-inspired ideas in general.{{sfn|Spence | 1999 | p=685}} The Campaign stopped student protests and tightened the political environment, but Hu remained popular among progressives in the party, intellectuals, and students.{{sfn|D.

Within days, most posters were writing about broader political issues, such as freedom of the press, democracy, and corruption.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=147}} Small spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on April 15 around [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] at [[Tiananmen Square]]. On the same day, many students at [[Peking University]] (PKU) and [[Tsinghua University]] erected shrines, and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion. Organized student gatherings also began on a small scale in [[Xi'an]] and Shanghai on April 16. On April 17, students at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]] (CUPL) made a large [[wreath]] to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its laying-party was on April 17 and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}} At 5&nbsp;pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the [[Great Hall of the People]], near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds giving public orations commemorating Hu and discussing social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the operation of the Great Hall, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\n\nStarting on the night of April 17, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the Square. As its size grew, the gathering gradually evolved into a protest, as students began to draft a list of pleas and suggestions (Seven Demands) for the government:\n# Affirm Hu Yaobang's views on democracy and freedom as correct.\n# Admit that the campaigns against [[Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign|spiritual pollution]] and bourgeois liberalization had been wrong.\n# Publish information on the income of state leaders and their family members.\n# Allow privately run newspapers and stop press censorship.\n# Increase funding for education and raise intellectuals' pay.\n# End restrictions on demonstrations in Beijing.\n# Provide objective coverage of students in official media.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}}\n\nOn the morning of April 18, students remained in the Square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes singing patriotic songs and listening to impromptu speeches by student organizers, others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at [[Xinhua Gate]], the entrance to [[Zhongnanhai]], the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the leadership. Police restrained the students from entering the compound. Students then staged a [[sit-in]].\n\nOn April 20, most students had been persuaded to leave Xinhua Gate. To disperse about 200 students that remained, police used batons; minor clashes were reported. Many students felt abused by the police, and rumours about police brutality spread quickly. This incident angered students on campus, where those who were not politically active decided to join the protests.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=149}} Also on this date, a group of workers calling themselves the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]] issued two handbills challenging the central leadership.{{sfn|Walder | Gong | 1993 | pp=1\u20132}}\n\nHu's [[state funeral]] took place on April 22. On the evening of April 21, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the Square was to be closed off for the funeral. The funeral, which took place inside the Great Hall and attended by the leadership, was broadcast live to the students. General secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] delivered the eulogy. The funeral seemed rushed, and only lasted 40 minutes, as emotions ran high in the Square. Students wept.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=152\u201353}}{{sfn|Li|2010}}\n\nSecurity cordoned off the east entrance to the Great Hall of the People, but several students pressed forward. A few were allowed to cross the police line. Three of these students ([[Zhou Yongjun]], [[Guo Haifeng]] and [[Zhang Zhiyong]]) knelt on the steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier [[Li Peng]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}{{efn| Analyst [[Richard Baum]] described their actions as \"...a mock-ceremonial remonstrance... presenting their scrolled-up demands on hands and knees in the stylized, obsequious manner of an imperial petition.\"{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=248}} Political scientist [[Lucian Pye]] similarly described the act as \"..in line with the classic Chinese tradition of aggrieved parties wailing before the Yamen door, of publicly dramatizing their unhappiness by petitioning officialdom... [they] sincerely believed that the officials would have to respond by meeting with them.\"{{sfn|Pye|1990|p=337}}&nbsp;}} Standing beside them, a fourth student ([[Wu'erkaixi]]) made a brief, emotional speech begging for Li Peng to come out and speak with them. The larger number of students still in the Square but outside the cordon were at times emotional, shouting demands or slogans and rushing toward police. Wu'erkaixi calmed the crowd down as they waited for the Premier to emerge. However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}\n\nOn April 21, students began organizing under the banners of formal organizations. On April 23, in a meeting of around 40 students from 21 universities, the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]] (also known as the Union) was formed. It elected CUPL student [[Zhou Yongjun]] as chair. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Wu'erkaixi]] also emerged as leaders. The Union then called for a general class boycott at all Beijing universities. Such an independent organization operating outside of party jurisdiction alarmed the leadership.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=154}}\n\nOn April 22, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in [[Changsha]] and [[Xi'an]]. In Xi'an, arson from rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government.{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009}} Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action. Zhao dismissed Li's views. Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to [[North Korea]] on April 23.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505\u201321}}\n\n===Turning point: April 26 Editorial===\n{{main|April 26 Editorial|l1=26 April Editorial}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=left\n|footer=General Secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] (left) who pushed for dialogue with students and Premier [[Li Peng]] (right) who declared martial law and backed military action\n|width1=150\n|image1=Zhao Ziyang (1985).jpg\n|alt1=Zhao Ziyang\n|width2=166\n|image2=Lipeng.jpg\n|alt2=Li Peng\n}}\nZhao's departure to North Korea left Li Peng as the acting executive authority in Beijing. On April 24, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] and mayor [[Chen Xitong]] to gauge the situation at the Square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and major party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed that firm action against protesters must be taken.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505\u201321}} On the morning of April 25, President [[Yang Shangkun]] and Premier [[Li Peng]] met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate 'warning' must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603\u201306}} The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests from the leadership, and highlighted Deng's having 'final say' on important issues. Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials in an effort to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.\n\nOn April 26, the party's official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' issued a front-page editorial titled \"[[April 26 Editorial|It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances]].\" The language in the editorial effectively branded the student movement to be an anti-party, anti-government revolt.{{sfn|April 26 Editorial|1995}} The article enraged students, who interpreted it as a direct indictment on the protests and its cause. The editorial backfired. Instead of scaring students into submission, it squarely antagonized the students against the government.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} The polarizing nature of the editorial made it a major sticking point for the remainder of the protests.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603\u201306}} The editorial evoked memories of the Cultural Revolution, using similar rhetoric as that used during the 1976 [[Tiananmen Incident]]\u2014an event that was initially branded an anti-government conspiracy but was later rehabilitated as \"patriotic\" under Deng's leadership.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===April 27 demonstrations===\n{{main|April 27 demonstrations|l1=27 April demonstrations}}\n[[File:Han Dongfang.png|thumb|upright|[[Han Dongfang]], founder of the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]]]]\nOrganized by the Union on April 27, some 50,000\u2013100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of \"anti-corruption, anti-cronyism\", but \"pro-party\".{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction as the result of an April 26 editorial.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}}\n\nThe stunning success of the March forced the government into making concessions and meeting with student representatives. On April 29, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman [[Yuan Mu]] met with appointed representatives of government-sanctioned student associations. While the talks discussed a wide range of issues, including the editorial, the Xinhua Gate incident and freedom of the press, they achieved few substantive results. Independent student leaders such as Wuer Kaixi refused to attend.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=157}}\n\nThe government's tone grew increasingly conciliatory as Zhao Ziyang returned from [[Pyongyang]] on April 30 and resumed his executive authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and concession was the only alternative.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=156}} Zhao asked that the press be opened to report the movement positively, and delivered two sympathetic speeches on May 3\u20134. In the speeches, Zhao said that the student's concerns about corruption were legitimate, and that the student movement was patriotic in nature.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}} The speeches essentially negated the message presented by April 26 Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched on the streets of Beijing on May 4 to commemorate the [[May Fourth Movement]] and repeat demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On May 4, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the class boycott. Subsequently, the majority of students began to lose interest in the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=159}}\n\n==Protests escalate==\n===Preparing for dialogue===\n{{main|Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement}}\nThe leadership was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, factional tensions, between the progressive camp and the conservative camp, intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}}\n\nIn preparation for dialogue, the Autonomous Student Union elected representatives to a formal delegation. There was some friction, however, as the Union leaders were reluctant to let the delegation unilaterally take control of the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=161}} The movement was slowed by a change to a more deliberate approach, fractured by internal discord, and increasingly diluted by declining engagement from the student body at large. In this context, a group of charismatic leaders, including Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi, desired to regain momentum. They also distrusted the government's offers of 'dialogue', dismissing them as merely a ploy designed to play for time and pacify the students. To break from the moderate and incremental approach now adopted by other major student leaders, these few began calling for a return to more confrontational measures. They settled on a plan of mobilizing students for a hunger strike on that would begin May 13.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=161\u201362}} Early attempts to mobilize others to join them met with only modest success until [[Chai Ling]] made an emotional appeal on the night before the strike was scheduled to begin.{{sfn|D.

The Chinese words written on the paper say, \"We want freedom of newspapers, freedom of associations, also to support the '[[World Economic Herald]]', and support those just journalists.\"]]\n\nStudents began the hunger strike on 13 May, two days before the highly publicized [[state visit]] by Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Knowing that the welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev was scheduled to be held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009 |pp=612\u201314}} By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}}\n\nInspired by the course of events in Beijing, protests and strikes began at universities in other cities, with many students traveling to Beijing to join the demonstration. Generally, the demonstration at Tiananmen Square was well ordered, with daily marches of students from various Beijing-area colleges displaying their solidarity with the class boycott and with the demands of the protest. The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'', the world socialist anthem, on their way to, and at, the square.<ref>''[[Amnesty International]]'', August 30, 1989. ''Preliminary Findings on Killings of Unarmed Civilians, Arbitrary Arrests and Summary Executions Since June 3, 1989'', p.19</ref>\n\nAfraid that the movement would spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping ordered the Square to be cleared for Gorbachev's visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao again used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}} Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation (not just the government). On the morning of 13 May, [[Yan Mingfu]], head of the Communist Party's [[United Front (China)|United Front]], called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Chen Ziming]] and [[Wang Juntao]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=164}} Yan said the government was prepared to hold immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether the students withdraw or not\u2014in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}}\n\n===Mikhail Gorbachev visit===\n{{main|1989 Sino-Soviet Summit}}\nPress restrictions were loosened significantly during early to mid-May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. On 14 May, intellectuals led by [[Dai Qing]] gained permission from [[Hu Qili]] to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals on ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]''. The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the Square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}} However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government, and refused to move. That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by [[Shen Tong]] and Xiang Xiaoji. Yan affirmed the patriotic nature of the student movement and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}} While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership. Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=169}} Yan then personally went to the Square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the April 26 Editorial and rebranding the movement as \"patriotic and democratic\"; Li refused.{{efn|Li, Peng. Diary entry for 15 May.}}\n\nThe students remained in the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, the first of its kind in [[Sino-Soviet split|some 30 years]], marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. However, its smooth proceedings was derailed by the student movement; this created a major embarrassment (\"loss of [[Face (sociological concept)|face]]\"){{sfn|Roberts|2011|p=300}} for the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=170}} The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the [[Great Hall of the People]] amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}} When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. Zhao's defense against this accusation was that privately informing world leaders that Deng was the true center of power was standard operating procedure; Li Peng had made nearly identical private statements to US president [[George H.W. Bush]] in February 1989.{{sfn|Sarotte|2012|p=165}} Nevertheless, the statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}}\n\n===Gathering momentum===\nThe hunger strike galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from 17\u201318 May. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} Many grassroots Party and [[Communist Youth League|Youth League]] organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng in support of students. The [[Red Cross Society of China|Chinese Red Cross]] issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, giving the movement international spotlight. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.\n\nThe movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained momentum. By 17 May, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not know how to respond. Because the demonstrations now included a wide array of social groups, each carrying its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate, and what the demands were. The government, still split on how to deal with the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} These combined circumstances put immense pressure on the authorities to act, and martial law was discussed as a viable response.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=181}}\n\nThe situation seemed intractable, so the weight of taking decisive action fell on paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Matters came to a head on May 17, during a [[Politburo Standing Committee]] meeting at Deng's residence.{{sfn|Li|2010}} At the meeting, Zhao Ziyang's concessions-based strategy, which called for the retraction of the April 26 Editorial, was thoroughly criticized.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} Li Peng, [[Yao Yilin]] and Deng asserted that by making a conciliatory speech to the [[Asian Development Bank]] on 4 May, Zhao exposed divisions within the top leadership and emboldened the students.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}}{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009|pp=25\u201334}}{{sfn|MacFarquhar|2011|p=443}} Deng warned that \"there is no way to back down now without the situation spiraling out of control\", and so \"the decision is to move troops into Beijing to declare [[martial law]]\"{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009|p=28}} as a show of the government's no-tolerance stance.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} To justify martial law, the demonstrators were described as tools of \"[[bourgeois liberalism]]\" advocates who were pulling the strings behind the scenes, as well as tools of elements within the party who wished to further their personal ambitions.{{sfn|Miles | 1997}} For the rest of his life, Zhao Ziyang maintained that the decision was ultimately in Deng's hands: among the five PSC members present at the meeting, he and [[Hu Qili]] opposed the imposition of martial law, Li Peng and Yao Yilin firmly supported it, and [[Qiao Shi]] remained carefully neutral and noncommittal. Deng appointed the latter three to carry out the decision.{{sfn|Z. Zhao |2009|p=28\u201330}}\n\n{{quote box|width=40%|align=left|quote=Students, we came too late. We are sorry.

Deng presided over the meeting and said that martial law was the only option. At the meeting Deng declared that he was 'mistaken' in choosing Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang as his successors, and resolved to remove Zhao from his position as general secretary. Deng also vowed to deal resolutely with Zhao's supporters and begin propaganda work.\n\n===Surveillance of protesters===\nStudent leaders were put under close surveillance by the authorities, traffic cameras were used to perform surveillance on the square and the restaurants in the nearby area and where students gathered were wiretapped.<ref name=\"4-corners-tremble-and-obey\">{{Cite episode|episode-link='https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/tremble-and-obey/11174758' |series=Four Coners|title=Tremble & Obey|time=00:24:50}}</ref> This surveillance led to the identification, capture and punishment of participants of the protest.<ref name=\"surveillance-politics\">{{Cite book|first=Richard Victor Ericson|last=Kevin D.

At the same time, he moved swiftly to send in police forces to control the streets and to purge Communist Party leaders who had supported the students.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nOn April 19, the editors of the ''[[World Economic Herald]]'', a magazine close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu. Inside was an article by [[Yan Jiaqi]], which commented favourably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge. Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, [[Jiang Zemin]] demanded that the article be censored. Many newspapers were printed with a blank page.{{sfn|Wright | 1990 | pp=121\u201332}} Jiang then suspended lead editor [[Qin Benli]]. His decisive action earned trust from conservative party elders, who praised Jiang's loyalty.\n\nIn Hong Kong on 27 May, over 300,000 people gathered at [[Happy Valley Racecourse]] for a gathering called Democratic songs dedicated for China ({{zh|t=\u6c11\u4e3b\u6b4c\u8072\u737b\u4e2d\u83ef}}).

Tens of thousands of demonstrators surrounded military vehicles, preventing them from either advancing or retreating. Protesters lectured soldiers and appealed to them to join their cause; they also provided soldiers with food, water, and shelter. Seeing no way forward, the authorities ordered the army to withdraw on 24 May. All government forces retreated to bases outside the city.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}}{{sfn|Secretary of State's}} While the army's withdrawal was initially seen as 'turning the tide' in favour of protesters, in reality mobilization took place across the country for a final assault.{{sfn|Brook|1998|pp=80\u201382}}\n\nAt the same time, internal divisions intensified within the student movement itself. By late May, the students became increasingly disorganized with no clear leadership or unified course of action. Moreover, Tiananmen Square was overcrowded and facing serious hygiene problems. [[Hou Dejian]] suggested an open election of the student leadership to speak for the movement, but was met with opposition.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Meanwhile, [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] moderated his position, ostensibly sensing the impending military action and consequences, and advocated for a temporary withdrawal from Tiananmen Square to re-group on campus, but this was opposed by 'hardliner' student factions who wanted to hold the Square. The increasing internal friction would lead to struggles for control of the loudspeakers in the middle of the square in a series of 'mini-coups': whoever controlled the loudspeakers was 'in charge' of the movement. Some students would wait at the train station to greet arrivals of students from other parts of the country in an attempt to enlist factional support.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Student groups began accusing each other of ulterior motives such as collusion with the government and trying to gain personal fame from the movement. Some students even tried to oust Chai Ling and Feng Congde from their leadership positions in an attempted kidnapping, an action Chai called a \"well-organized and premeditated plot.\"{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===June 1\u20133===\nOn June 1, [[Li Peng]] issued a report titled \"On the True Nature of the Turmoil\", which was circulated to every member of the Politburo.{{sfn|L.

Zhang |2001|p=338}} In conjunction with the plan to clear the Square by force, the Politburo received word from the martial law troops headquarters stating that the troops were ready to help stabilize the capital, and that they understood the necessity and legality of martial law to overcome the turmoil.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=349}}\n\nOn June 2, the movement saw an increase in action and protest, solidifying the CPC's decision that it was time to act. Protests broke out as newspapers published articles that called for the students to leave Tiananmen Square and end the movement. Many of the students in the Square were not willing to leave and were outraged by the articles.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=353}} They were also outraged by ''Beijing Daily's'' June 1 article \"Tiananmen, I Cry for You\", written by a fellow student who had become disillusioned with the movement, as he thought it was chaotic and disorganized.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=353}} In response to the articles, thousands of students lined the streets of Beijing to protest against leaving the Square.{{sfn|L. Zhang |2001|p=362}}\n\nThree intellectuals, [[Liu Xiaobo]], Zhou Duo, Gao Xin and a Taiwanese singer [[Hou Dejian]] declared a second hunger strike because they wanted to revive the pro-democracy movement.{{sfn|Brook| 1998|p=94}} After weeks of occupying the Square, the students were tired, and internal rifts opened between moderate and hardliner student groups.{{sfn|Mathews | 1989}} In their declaration speech, the hunger strikers openly criticized the government's suppression of the movement to remind the students that their cause was worth fighting for, and pushed them to continue their occupation of the Square.{{sfn|L.

By 10:30{{nbsp}}pm, news of bloodshed to the west and south of the city began trickling into the Square, often told by witnesses drenched in blood. At midnight, the students' loudspeaker announced news that a student had been killed on West Chang'an Avenue, near the Military Museum and a somber mood settled on the Square. Li Lu, the deputy commander of the student headquarters, urged students to remain united in defending the Square through non-violent means. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, [[Wu'erkaixi]] fainted after learning that a female student at Beijing Normal University, who had left campus with him earlier in the evening, had just been killed.

One APC stalled, perhaps by metal poles jammed into its wheels, and the demonstrators covered it with gasoline-doused blankets and set it on fire. The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum on the east side of the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (1)}}\n\nPressure mounted on the student leadership to abandon non-violence and retaliate against the killings.

The \"[[Tank Man]]\", as it became known, became one of the most iconic photographs in the 20th century. As the tank driver tried to go around him, the \"Tank Man\" moved into the tank's path. He continued to stand defiantly in front of the tanks for some time, then climbed up onto the turret of the lead tank to speak to the soldiers inside. After returning to his position in front of the tanks, the man was pulled aside by a group of people.{{sfn|Frontline: Tank Man|2006}}\n\nAlthough the fate of \"Tank Man\" following the demonstration is not known, then-paramount Chinese leader Jiang Zemin stated in 1990 that he did not think the man was killed.{{sfn|Iyer|1998}} ''Time'' later named him one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most influential people of the 20th century]].\n\nA stopped convoy of 37 APCs on Changan Boulevard at Muxidi was forced to abandon their vehicles after becoming stuck among an assortment of burned out buses and military vehicles.{{sfn|Brook|1998|pp=178\u201379}} In addition to occasional incidents of soldiers opening fire on civilians in Beijing, Western news outlets reported clashes between units of the PLA.{{sfn|Kristof:Units Clash}} Late in the afternoon 26 tanks, three armored personnel carriers and supporting infantry took up defensive positions facing East at [[Jianguomen (Beijing)|Jianguomen]] and [[Fuxingmen]] overpasses.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=189}} Shellfire was heard throughout the night and the next morning a United States Marine in the eastern part of the city reported spotting a damaged armored vehicle that had been disabled by an armor-piercing shell.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=190}} The ongoing turmoil in the capital disrupted the flow of everyday life.

Dissidents shared cells with murderers and rapists, and torture was not uncommon.{{sfn|Miles | 1997 | p=30}}\n\n===Media coverage===\n====Chinese media====\n{{see also|People's Daily during the 1989 Student Movement}}\nThe suppression on June 4 marked the end of a period of relative press freedom in China and media workers\u2014both foreign and domestic\u2014faced heightened restrictions and punishment in the aftermath of the crackdown. State media reports in the immediate aftermath were sympathetic to the students. As a result, those responsible were all later removed from their posts. Two news anchors [[Xue Fei (host)|Xue Fei]] and [[Du Xian (news anchor)|Du Xian]], who reported this event on June 4 in the daily ''[[Xinwen Lianbo]]'' broadcast on [[China Central Television]] were fired because they displayed sad emotions. Wu Xiaoyong, the son of former foreign minister [[Wu Xueqian]] was removed from the English Program Department of [[Chinese Radio International]], ostensibly for his sympathies towards protesters. Editors and other staff at ''[[People's Daily]]'', including director [[Qian Liren]] and Editor-in-Chief Tan Wenrui, were also sacked because of reports in the paper which were sympathetic towards the protesters.{{sfn|Wudunn | 1989}} Several editors were arrested.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n====Foreign media====\n{{main|Foreign Media and the Tiananmen Square Protests}}\nWith the imposition of martial law, the Chinese government cut off the satellite transmissions of western broadcasters such as CNN and CBS. Broadcasters tried to defy these orders by reporting via telephone. Footage was quickly smuggled out of the country. The only network which was able to record shots during the night of June 4 was [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola]] of Spain (TVE).{{sfn|Bregolat|2007}} During the military action, some foreign journalists faced harassment from authorities.

Many Asian countries remained silent throughout the protests; the government of India responded to the massacre by ordering the state television to offer only the absolute minimum coverage of the incident, so as not to jeopardize a thawing in relations with China, and to offer political empathy for the events.{{sfn|Mohan | 2009}} Cuba, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, among others, supported the Chinese government and denounced the protests.{{sfn|Aftermath of Crisis|1989}} Overseas Chinese students demonstrated in many cities in Europe, America, the Middle East and Asia.{{sfn|Troubles Provoke}}\n\n==Impact and legacy==\n===Political impact===\n{{see|Political purges during and after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests}}\nThe protests led to a strengthened role for the party in domestic affairs. In its aftermath, many of the freedoms introduced during the 1980s were rescinded, as the party returned to a conventional Leninist mold and re-established firm control over the press, publishing, and mass media. The protests were also a blow to the separation of powers model established following the Cultural Revolution, whereby the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] was a [[figurehead|symbolic position]], while the real centres of power, i.e., the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] were [[Separation of powers|intended to be different people]], to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule.\n\nWhen President [[Yang Shangkun]] asserted his [[reserve powers]] with his post of [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] and openly split with general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] over the use of force to side with Premier [[Li Peng]] and Central Military Commission chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]], official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. By 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military Commission chairman and President were all consolidated into the same person, a practice that has been continued since.\n\nIn 1989, neither the Chinese military nor the Beijing police had sufficient anti-riot gear, such as rubber bullets and tear gas.{{sfn|MacKinnon | 1999}} After the Tiananmen Square protests, riot police in Chinese cities were equipped with non-lethal equipment for riot control. The protests led to increased spending on internal security and expanded the role of the People's Armed Police in suppressing urban protests.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe restrictions on society were loosened only a few years after the protests, especially after Deng's 1992 \"southern tour\".{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=195}} Privately run print media again flourished. Private newspapers increased from 250 in the 1980s to over 7,000 by 2003. Provincially run satellite TV stations sprung up all over the country and challenged the market share of state-run CCTV.{{sfn|Kurlantzick | 2003 | p=50}} The leadership also stepped away from promoting communism as an all-encompassing belief system. State-approved religious organizations increased their membership significantly, and traditional beliefs suppressed during the Mao era re-appeared.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=50}} This state-sanctioned plurality also created the environment for unsanctioned forms of spirituality and worship to grow.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}} To reduce the need for controversial methods of state control, while Protestants, Buddhists, and Taoists were largely left alone, the state often used these 'approved' denominations to \"fight against cults\" such as [[Falun Gong]], playing sects off each other.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}}\n\nAs the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's \"national pride\", turning domestic public opinion back in its favour.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=201}} This is perhaps most prominently seen in May 1999, when the United States [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]].{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} The bombings saw an outpouring of nationalist sentiment and increased support for the party as the foremost advocate of China's national interest.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}}\n\n===Economic impact===\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests, many analysts downgraded their outlook of China's economic future.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} The violent response to the protests was one of the factors that led to a delay in China's acceptance to the [[World Trade Organization]], which was not completed until twelve years later, in 2001.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} Furthermore, bilateral aid to China decreased from $3.4&nbsp;billion in 1988 to $700&nbsp;million in 1990.{{sfn|Foot|2000}} Loans to China were suspended by the [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank]], and foreign governments;{{sfn|Thakur | Burton | Srivastava | 1997 | pp=404\u201305}} China's credit rating was lowered;{{sfn|Foot|2000}} tourism revenue decreased from US$2.2&nbsp;billion to US$1.8&nbsp;billion; foreign direct investment commitments were cancelled. There was a rise in defense spending from 8.6% in 1986, to 15.5% in 1990, reversing a previous 10-year decline.{{sfn|Kelley | Shenkar | 1993 | pp=120\u201322}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, the government sought again to centralize control over the economy,{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} though the changes were short-lived.  Sensing that conservative policies had again taken a foothold within the party, Deng, now retired from all of his official positions, launched his \"southern tour\" in 1992, visiting various cities in the country's most prosperous regions while advocating for further economic reforms.{{sfn|Wu | 2015}} Partly in response to Deng, by the mid-1990s, the country was again pursuing market liberalization on a scale even greater than those seen in the initial stages of the reform in the 1980s. Although political liberals were purged within the party, many of those who were economically liberal remained.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} The economic shocks caused by the events of 1989, in retrospect, had only a minor and temporary effect on China's economic growth. Indeed, with many previously aggrieved groups now regarding political opening as a lost cause, more energy was spent on economic activities. The economy would quickly regain momentum into the 1990s.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}}\n\n===Hong Kong===\n[[File:2009candlevigil1.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Candlelight vigil]] in Hong Kong in 2009 on the 20th anniversary of the June 4th incident]]\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiananmen square protests led to fears that China would renege on its commitments under [[one country, two systems]] following the impending handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997. In response, Governor [[Chris Patten]] tried to expand the [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], which led to friction with Beijing. For many Hong Kongers, Tiananmen served as a turning point for when they lost trust in the Beijing government. The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong|a sizeable exodus of Hong Kongers]] to Western countries such as Canada and Australia prior to 1997.\n\nThere have been [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|large candlelight vigils attended by tens of thousands in Hong Kong every year since 1989]] even after the transfer of power to China in 1997. The [[June 4th Museum]] closed in July 2016, after only two years in its location. The group that runs the museum, the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China|Hong Kong Alliance]], has started to crowdfund money to open the museum in a new location.{{sfn|Kam|2016}}\n\nThe events of Tiananmen in 1989 have become permanently etched in the public consciousness, perhaps more than anywhere else outside mainland China. The events continue to have a strong impact on perceptions of China, its government, attitudes towards democracy, and the extent to which Hong Kongers should identify as \"Chinese.\" The events of June 4 are seen as representative of the Chinese brand of authoritarianism and is often invoked by pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong, especially in relation to democratic reform in Hong Kong and the territory's relationship with Beijing. Academic studies indicate that those who supported the rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square movement had a tendency to support democratization in the territory as well as the election of pro-democracy parties.{{Sfn|Lee|2012|pp=152, 155}}\n\n===Impact on China's national image===\nThe Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests. In its immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a [[pariah state]], increasingly isolated internationally. This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. However, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=424}} From there on, China would work domestically as well as internationally to reshape its national image from that of a repressive regime to a benign global economic and military partner.{{sfn|Cabestan | 2010 |p= 194}}\n\nIn the 1990s, China attempted to demonstrate its willingness to participate in international economic and defense institutions to secure investment for continued economic reforms.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 19}} The government signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1992, the [[Chemical Weapons Convention|Convention on Chemical Weapons]] in 1993 and the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} Whereas China had been a member of only 30 international organizations in 1986, it was a member of over 50 by 1997.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=198}} China also sought to diversify its external partnerships, establishing good diplomatic relations with post-Soviet Russia,{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} and welcoming Taiwanese business in lieu of Western investment.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} China expedited negotiations with the [[World Trade Organization]] and established relations with Indonesia, Israel, South Korea and others in 1992.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} While China was a net recipient of aid throughout the 1980s, its growing economic and military role transformed it into a net provider of aid.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}\n\nFurthermore, the government has successfully promoted China as an attractive destination for investment by emphasizing the country's skilled workers, comparatively lower wages, established infrastructure, and sizeable consumer base.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=55}} Increased foreign investment in the country led many world leaders to believe that by constructively engaging China in the global marketplace, political reforms would inevitably follow.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} At the same time, the explosion of commercial interest in the country opened the way for multinational corporations to turn a blind eye to politics and human rights in favour of focusing on business interests. Since then, Western leaders who were previously critical of China have sometimes paid lip service to the legacy of Tiananmen in bilateral meetings, but the substance of discussions revolved around business and trade interests.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}\n\n===European Union and United States arms embargo===\n{{main|European Union arms embargo on the People's Republic of China}}\nThe European Union and United States embargo on armament sales to China, put in place as a result of the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, remains in place today. China has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from European Union members. Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as \"outdated\" and damaging to China\u2013European Union relations. In early 2004, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] spearheaded a movement within the European Union to lift the ban, which was supported by German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]. However, the passing of the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] in March 2005 increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban and several European Union Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban. Moreover, Schr\u00f6der's successor [[Angela Merkel]] opposed lifting the ban. Members of the United States Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the European Union if the latter lifted the ban. The United Kingdom also opposed the lifting of the embargo when it took charge of the European Union presidency in July 2005.\n\nIn addition, the [[European Parliament]] has consistently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo to China. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many argue it reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options from where it may seek military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former [[Soviet bloc]] that it had a strained relationship with as a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.{{sfn|Japan Concerned}}\n\n==Contemporary issues==\n===Censorship in China===\n{{further|Censorship in the People's Republic of China}}\n{{see also|Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China#Specific examples of internet censorship|l1=Internet censorship of the protest}}\nThe [[Communist Party of China]] forbids discussion of the Tiananmen Square protests{{sfn|Saiget |2009}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2020|reason=Made taboo not forbidden}}\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems|title=One App, Two Systems|at=figure 9|access-date=September 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010221114/https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems/|archive-date=October 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2020|reason=App censors this, but that doesn't mean it's forbidden, or even that this is because the Communist Party directly}} and has taken measures to block or censor related information.

The study also found that 87% of Chinese are satisfied with their government, and 74% of Chinese believe that their government is on the right path<ref name=\":0\" />. Besides, many countries (including those involved in the [[revolutions of 1989]] and [[Libyan Crisis (2011\u2013present)|Libya]], [[Ukraine]] after 2014, etc.) experienced a \"[[Colour revolution|color revolution]]\" supported by [[Western world|Western countries]] since the end of 20th century, and had been in an extended economic downturn or even fallen into political turmoil. In this context, by the 2010s, Chinese society had generally started to support the negative perspective of the June 4 incident and the violent repression of the government was recognized. Among those who now hold a negative view of the June 4th incident(Tiananmen protest) in mainland China, there are even former democrats in the Tiananmen protest. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/china/2014/06/140603_june4forum_posts_highlight|title=\u7f51\u53cb\u8bc4\u8bba\u7cbe\u9009\uff1a\u4e2d\u56fd\u81ea\u516d\u56db\u4ee5\u6765\u53d8\u5316|work=BBC News \u4e2d\u6587|access-date=2020-04-10|language=zh-CN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20140609000740-260109?chdtv|title=\u5f90\u5b97\u61cb\u5c08\u6b04\uff0d\u516d\u56db\u7684\u56de\u60f3\u8207\u611f\u60f3 - \u6642\u8ad6\u5ee3\u5834|last=\u4e2d\u6642\u96fb\u5b50\u5831|website=\u4e2d\u6642\u96fb\u5b50\u5831|language=zh-Hant-TW|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> \n\nThe government's use of tanks during the cleanup of the June 4 Incident is now even considered to be an effective means of violent repression in the public discussion in China<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Myers|first=Steven Lee|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-china.html|title=China Is Waging a Disinformation War Against Hong Kong Protesters|date=2019-08-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-10|last2=Mozur|first2=Paul|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>.

The popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the''' '89 Democracy Movement''' ({{lang-zh|s=\u516b\u4e5d\u6c11\u904b|p=b\u0101ji\u01d4 m\u00edny\u00f9n}}). The protests started on April 15 and were forcibly suppressed on June 4 when the government declared [[martial law]] and sent the military to occupy central parts of Beijing. In what became known as the '''Tiananmen Square Massacre''' ({{lang-zh|s=\u5929\u5b89\u9580\u5927\u5c60\u6bba|p=ti\u0101n'\u0101nm\u00e9n d\u00e0 t\u00fash\u0101}}), [[People's Liberation Army at the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests|troops]] with [[assault rifle]]s and [[tank]]s fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square.

The [[Chinese economic reform|reforms of the 1980s]] had led to a nascent [[market economy]] which benefited some people but seriously disaffected others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy,{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=216}} and restrictions on political participation. The students called for greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, [[freedom of the press]], and [[freedom of speech]], although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied.{{sfn|Lim|2014a|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfn|Nathan|2001}} At the height of the protests, about 1&nbsp;million people assembled in the Square.{{sfn|D.

Western countries imposed arms embargoes on China.{{sfn|Dube | 2014 }} The Chinese government made widespread arrests of protesters and their supporters, suppressed [[1989 Chinese protests by region|other protests around China]], expelled foreign journalists, strictly controlled coverage of the events in the domestic press, strengthened the police and internal security forces, and demoted or purged officials it deemed sympathetic to the protests.{{sfn|Miles | 1997 | p=28}} More broadly, the suppression halted the policies of liberalization in the 1980s.

Thus, the common Chinese name for the crackdown is \"June Fourth Incident\" ({{zh|c=\u516d\u56db\u4e8b\u4ef6 |p=li\u00f9s\u00ec sh\u00ecji\u00e0n}}). The nomenclature of the former is consistent with the customary names of the other two great protests that occurred in Tiananmen Square: the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919 and the [[Tiananmen Incident|April Fifth Movement]] of 1976. June Fourth refers to the day on which the People's Liberation Army cleared Tiananmen Square of protesters, although actual operations began on the evening of June 3. Names such as June Fourth Movement ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u516d\u56db\u8fd0\u52a8 |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec y\u00f9nd\u00f2ng}}) and '89 Democracy Movement ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u516b\u4e5d\u6c11\u8fd0 |p=b\u0101-ji\u01d4 m\u00edny\u00f9n}}) are used to describe the event in its entirety.\n\nOutside mainland China, and among circles critical of the crackdown within mainland China, it is commonly referred to in Chinese as June Fourth Massacre ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u516d\u56db\u5c60\u6bba |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec t\u00fash\u0101}}) and June Fourth Crackdown ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u516d\u56db\u93ae\u58d3 |p=li\u00f9-s\u00ec zh\u00e8ny\u0101}}). To bypass [[internet censorship in China]], which uniformly considers all the above-mentioned names too 'Sensitive' for search engines and public forums, alternative names have sprung up to describe the events on the Internet, such as May&nbsp;35th, VIIV ([[Roman numerals]] for 6 and 4), Eight Squared (i.e. 8<sup>2</sup>=64){{sfn|China tightens information}} and 8964.<ref name=\"HKFP8964\">''[https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ Bus driver in \u20188964\u2019 massacre memento suspended for 3 months] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622185220/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/13/bus-displayed-8964-commemoration-tiananmen-massacre-sees-driver-suspended-3-months/ |date=June 22, 2019 }}'', June 13, 2016, [[Chantal Yuen]], [[Hong Kong Free Press]].</ref>\n\nThe [[government of the People's Republic of China]] have used numerous names for the event since 1989, gradually reducing the intensity of terminology applied.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}} As the events were unfolding, it was labelled a \"counterrevolutionary riot\", which was later changed to simply \"riot\", followed by \"political storm\" and finally the leadership settled on the more neutralized phrase \"political turmoil between the Spring and Summer of 1989\", which it uses to this day.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=634}}{{sfn|Day China trampled2009}}\n\nIn English, the terms Tiananmen Square Massacre, Tiananmen Square Protests or Tiananmen Square Crackdown are often used to describe the series of events. However, much of the violence in Beijing did not actually happen in Tiananmen, but outside the square along a stretch of [[Chang'an Avenue]] only a few miles long, and especially near the [[Muxidi]] area.{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=283}} The term also gives a misleading impression that demonstrations only happened in Beijing, when in fact they occurred in many cities throughout China.{{sfn|Miles|2009}}\n\n==Background==\n{{History of the People's Republic of China}}\nThe [[Cultural Revolution]] ended with chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976. The movement, spearheaded by Mao, caused severe damage to the country's originally diverse economic and social fabric. The country was mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the Communist Party itself. At the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee]] in December 1978, [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's [[Paramount leader|''de facto'' leader]]. Deng launched a comprehensive [[Chinese economic reform|program to reform the Chinese economy]]. Within several years, the country's direction entirely changed. The focus on ideological purity was replaced by a full-on drive to achieve material prosperity.\n\nTo run his reform agenda, Deng promoted his allies to top government and party posts. [[Hu Yaobang]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the Communist Party in 1982, while [[Zhao Ziyang]] was named [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], the head of government, in September 1980.\n\n===Challenges with reform===\nThe reforms aimed to decrease the role of the state in the economy and gradually introduced private forms of production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had de-collectivized and 80% of state owned enterprises were permitted to retain profits. Within a few years, production increased by leaps and bounds, and poverty was reduced substantially.\n\nWhile the reforms were generally well received by the public, concerns grew over a series of social problems that the changes brought about, including [[Corruption in China|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] by elite party bureaucrats.{{sfn|Naughton|2007| p=91}} The state-mandated pricing system, in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices stable at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, this allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices. Party bureaucrats suddenly found themselves in charge of a burgeoning state regime over economic management and enormous incentives for [[arbitrage]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=120}} Discontent over corruption reached a fever pitch with the public, and many, particularly those in the intellectual community, began to believe that only democratic reform and rule of law could act as a panacea for the country's ills.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|Chapter 5: On the Eve of the 1989 Movement}}\n\nFollowing the 1988 [[Beidaihe]] meeting, the party leadership under Deng agreed to a transition to a market-based pricing system.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} News of the relaxation of price controls triggered waves of cash withdrawals, buying and hoarding all over China.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}} The government panicked and rescinded the price reforms in less than two weeks, but its impact was pronounced for much longer. Inflation soared. Official indices report that the [[Consumer Price Index]] increased 30% in Beijing between 1987 and 1988, leading to panic among salaried workers that they could no longer afford staple goods.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Moreover, in the new market economy, unprofitable [[state-owned enterprise]]s were pressured to cut costs. This threatened a vast proportion of the population which relied on the \"[[iron rice bowl]]\", i.e. a host of social benefits such as job security, medical care and subsidized housing.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}}\n\n===Social disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis===\nReformist leaders envisioned in 1978 that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=81}} Despite the opening of new universities and increased enrollment,{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased market demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=84}} The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=82}} Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered on the basis of [[nepotism]] and favoritism.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=89}} Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in their area of jurisdiction.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the \"Democracy Salon\" and the \"Lawn Salon\" (''C\u01ceod\u00ec Sh\u0101l\u00f3ng''), began appearing on Beijing university campuses.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=137}} These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=127}}\n\nAt the same time, the party's nominally socialist ideology faced a legitimacy crisis as it gradually adopted capitalist practices.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}} Private enterprise gave rise to profiteers who took advantage of lax regulations, and who often flaunted their wealth in front of those who were less well off.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=600\u201301}} Popular discontent was brewing over unfair wealth distribution. Greed, not skill, appeared to be the most crucial factor of success. There was widespread public disillusionment over the country's future. People wanted change, yet the power to define 'the correct path' continued to rest solely in the hands of the unelected government.{{sfn|Wang|2006|p=57}}\n\nThe comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over the pace of [[marketization]] and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers (\"the right\", led by [[Hu Yaobang]]) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives (\"the left\", led by [[Chen Yun]]) said that the reforms had gone too far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. However, both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===1986 student demonstrations===\n{{Main|1986 Chinese Student Demonstrations}}\nIn mid-1986, astrophysics professor [[Fang Lizhi]] returned from a position at [[Princeton University]] and began a personal tour around universities in China; speaking about liberty, human rights, and [[separation of powers]]. Fang was part of a wider undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment, and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, were a direct result of the authoritarian political system and the rigid command economy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=64, 215}} The view that political reform was the only answer to China's on-going problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated all over the country.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}} In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems, while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.{{sfn|E. Cheng | 2009 | p=33}}\n\nInspired by Fang and other 'people-power' movements around the world, in December 1986, student demonstrators staged protests against the slow pace of reform. The issues were wide-ranging, and included demands for economic liberalization, democracy, and rule of law.{{sfn|Wang | 2006| pp=56\u201357}} While the protests were initially contained in [[Hefei]], where Fang lived, they quickly spread to Shanghai, Beijing and other major cities. This alarmed the central leadership, who accused the students of instigating Cultural Revolution-style turmoil.\n\nGeneral secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] was blamed for taking a soft attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives. Hu was forced to resign as general secretary on January 16, 1987. Then the party began the \"Anti-[[bourgeois liberalization]] Campaign\", taking aim at Hu, political liberalization and Western-inspired ideas in general.{{sfn|Spence | 1999 | p=685}} The Campaign stopped student protests and tightened the political environment, but Hu remained popular among progressives in the party, intellectuals, and students.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=138}}\n\n==Protest development==\n===Death of Hu Yaobang===\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ Student leaders\n!scope=\"col\"|Name\n!scope=\"col\"|Origin and affiliation\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Chai Ling]]\n|[[Shandong]]; [[Beijing Normal University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Wu'erkaixi]] (\u00d6rkesh)\n|[[Xinjiang]]; [[Beijing Normal University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]]\n|Beijing; [[Peking University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Feng Congde]]\n|[[Sichuan]]; [[Peking University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Shen Tong]]\n|Beijing; [[Peking University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Wang Youcai]]\n|[[Zhejiang]]; [[Peking University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Li Lu]]\n|[[Hebei]]; [[Nanjing University]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|[[Zhou Yongjun]]\n|[[China University of Political Science and Law]]\n|}\n\nWhen [[Hu Yaobang]] suddenly died of a heart attack on April 15, 1989, students reacted strongly, most of them believing that his death was related to his forced resignation.{{sfn|Calhoun}} Hu's death provided the initial impetus for students to gather in large numbers.{{sfn|Pan | 2008 | p=274}} In university campuses, many posters appeared eulogizing Hu, calling for a revival of Hu's legacy. Within days, most posters were writing about broader political issues, such as freedom of the press, democracy, and corruption.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=147}} Small spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on April 15 around [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] at [[Tiananmen Square]]. On the same day, many students at [[Peking University]] (PKU) and [[Tsinghua University]] erected shrines, and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion. Organized student gatherings also began on a small scale in [[Xi'an]] and Shanghai on April 16. On April 17, students at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]] (CUPL) made a large [[wreath]] to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its laying-party was on April 17 and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}} At 5&nbsp;pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the [[Great Hall of the People]], near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds giving public orations commemorating Hu and discussing social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the operation of the Great Hall, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.\n\nStarting on the night of April 17, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the Square. As its size grew, the gathering gradually evolved into a protest, as students began to draft a list of pleas and suggestions (Seven Demands) for the government:\n# Affirm Hu Yaobang's views on democracy and freedom as correct.\n# Admit that the campaigns against [[Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign|spiritual pollution]] and bourgeois liberalization had been wrong.\n# Publish information on the income of state leaders and their family members.\n# Allow privately run newspapers and stop press censorship.\n# Increase funding for education and raise intellectuals' pay.\n# End restrictions on demonstrations in Beijing.\n# Provide objective coverage of students in official media.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=148}}\n\nOn the morning of April 18, students remained in the Square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes singing patriotic songs and listening to impromptu speeches by student organizers, others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at [[Xinhua Gate]], the entrance to [[Zhongnanhai]], the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the leadership. Police restrained the students from entering the compound. Students then staged a [[sit-in]].\n\nOn April 20, most students had been persuaded to leave Xinhua Gate. To disperse about 200 students that remained, police used batons; minor clashes were reported. Many students felt abused by the police, and rumours about police brutality spread quickly. This incident angered students on campus, where those who were not politically active decided to join the protests.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=149}} Also on this date, a group of workers calling themselves the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]] issued two handbills challenging the central leadership.{{sfn|Walder | Gong | 1993 | pp=1\u20132}}\n\nHu's [[state funeral]] took place on April 22. On the evening of April 21, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the Square was to be closed off for the funeral. The funeral, which took place inside the Great Hall and attended by the leadership, was broadcast live to the students. General secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] delivered the eulogy. The funeral seemed rushed, and only lasted 40 minutes, as emotions ran high in the Square. Students wept.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=152\u201353}}{{sfn|Li|2010}}\n\nSecurity cordoned off the east entrance to the Great Hall of the People, but several students pressed forward. A few were allowed to cross the police line. Three of these students ([[Zhou Yongjun]], [[Guo Haifeng]] and [[Zhang Zhiyong]]) knelt on the steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier [[Li Peng]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}{{efn| Analyst [[Richard Baum]] described their actions as \"...a mock-ceremonial remonstrance... presenting their scrolled-up demands on hands and knees in the stylized, obsequious manner of an imperial petition.\"{{sfn|Baum|1996|p=248}} Political scientist [[Lucian Pye]] similarly described the act as \"..in line with the classic Chinese tradition of aggrieved parties wailing before the Yamen door, of publicly dramatizing their unhappiness by petitioning officialdom... [they] sincerely believed that the officials would have to respond by meeting with them.\"{{sfn|Pye|1990|p=337}}&nbsp;}} Standing beside them, a fourth student ([[Wu'erkaixi]]) made a brief, emotional speech begging for Li Peng to come out and speak with them. The larger number of students still in the Square but outside the cordon were at times emotional, shouting demands or slogans and rushing toward police. Wu'erkaixi calmed the crowd down as they waited for the Premier to emerge. However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=153}}\n\nOn April 21, students began organizing under the banners of formal organizations. On April 23, in a meeting of around 40 students from 21 universities, the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]] (also known as the Union) was formed. It elected CUPL student [[Zhou Yongjun]] as chair. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Wu'erkaixi]] also emerged as leaders. The Union then called for a general class boycott at all Beijing universities. Such an independent organization operating outside of party jurisdiction alarmed the leadership.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=154}}\n\nOn April 22, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in [[Changsha]] and [[Xi'an]]. In Xi'an, arson from rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government.{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009}} Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action. Zhao dismissed Li's views. Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to [[North Korea]] on April 23.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505\u201321}}\n\n===Turning point: April 26 Editorial===\n{{main|April 26 Editorial|l1=26 April Editorial}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=left\n|footer=General Secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] (left) who pushed for dialogue with students and Premier [[Li Peng]] (right) who declared martial law and backed military action\n|width1=150\n|image1=Zhao Ziyang (1985).jpg\n|alt1=Zhao Ziyang\n|width2=166\n|image2=Lipeng.jpg\n|alt2=Li Peng\n}}\nZhao's departure to North Korea left Li Peng as the acting executive authority in Beijing. On April 24, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] and mayor [[Chen Xitong]] to gauge the situation at the Square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and major party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed that firm action against protesters must be taken.{{sfn|Liu|1990|pp=505\u201321}} On the morning of April 25, President [[Yang Shangkun]] and Premier [[Li Peng]] met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate 'warning' must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603\u201306}} The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests from the leadership, and highlighted Deng's having 'final say' on important issues. Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials in an effort to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.\n\nOn April 26, the party's official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' issued a front-page editorial titled \"[[April 26 Editorial|It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances]].\" The language in the editorial effectively branded the student movement to be an anti-party, anti-government revolt.{{sfn|April 26 Editorial|1995}} The article enraged students, who interpreted it as a direct indictment on the protests and its cause. The editorial backfired. Instead of scaring students into submission, it squarely antagonized the students against the government.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} The polarizing nature of the editorial made it a major sticking point for the remainder of the protests.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|pp=603\u201306}} The editorial evoked memories of the Cultural Revolution, using similar rhetoric as that used during the 1976 [[Tiananmen Incident]]\u2014an event that was initially branded an anti-government conspiracy but was later rehabilitated as \"patriotic\" under Deng's leadership.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}}\n\n===April 27 demonstrations===\n{{main|April 27 demonstrations|l1=27 April demonstrations}}\n[[File:Han Dongfang.png|thumb|upright|[[Han Dongfang]], founder of the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]]]]\nOrganized by the Union on April 27, some 50,000\u2013100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of \"anti-corruption, anti-cronyism\", but \"pro-party\".{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}} In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction as the result of an April 26 editorial.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=155}}\n\nThe stunning success of the March forced the government into making concessions and meeting with student representatives. On April 29, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman [[Yuan Mu]] met with appointed representatives of government-sanctioned student associations. While the talks discussed a wide range of issues, including the editorial, the Xinhua Gate incident and freedom of the press, they achieved few substantive results. Independent student leaders such as Wuer Kaixi refused to attend.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=157}}\n\nThe government's tone grew increasingly conciliatory as Zhao Ziyang returned from [[Pyongyang]] on April 30 and resumed his executive authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and concession was the only alternative.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=156}} Zhao asked that the press be opened to report the movement positively, and delivered two sympathetic speeches on May 3\u20134. In the speeches, Zhao said that the student's concerns about corruption were legitimate, and that the student movement was patriotic in nature.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}} The speeches essentially negated the message presented by April 26 Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched on the streets of Beijing on May 4 to commemorate the [[May Fourth Movement]] and repeat demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On May 4, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the class boycott. Subsequently, the majority of students began to lose interest in the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=159}}\n\n==Protests escalate==\n===Preparing for dialogue===\n{{main|Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement}}\nThe leadership was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, factional tensions, between the progressive camp and the conservative camp, intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=608}}\n\nIn preparation for dialogue, the Autonomous Student Union elected representatives to a formal delegation. There was some friction, however, as the Union leaders were reluctant to let the delegation unilaterally take control of the movement.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=161}} The movement was slowed by a change to a more deliberate approach, fractured by internal discord, and increasingly diluted by declining engagement from the student body at large. In this context, a group of charismatic leaders, including Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi, desired to regain momentum. They also distrusted the government's offers of 'dialogue', dismissing them as merely a ploy designed to play for time and pacify the students. To break from the moderate and incremental approach now adopted by other major student leaders, these few began calling for a return to more confrontational measures. They settled on a plan of mobilizing students for a hunger strike on that would begin May 13.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|pp=161\u201362}} Early attempts to mobilize others to join them met with only modest success until [[Chai Ling]] made an emotional appeal on the night before the strike was scheduled to begin.{{sfn|D.

The Chinese words written on the paper say, \"We want freedom of newspapers, freedom of associations, also to support the '[[World Economic Herald]]', and support those just journalists.\"]]\n\nStudents began the hunger strike on 13 May, two days before the highly publicized [[state visit]] by Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Knowing that the welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev was scheduled to be held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009 |pp=612\u201314}} By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}}\n\nInspired by the course of events in Beijing, protests and strikes began at universities in other cities, with many students traveling to Beijing to join the demonstration. Generally, the demonstration at Tiananmen Square was well ordered, with daily marches of students from various Beijing-area colleges displaying their solidarity with the class boycott and with the demands of the protest. The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'', the world socialist anthem, on their way to, and at, the square.<ref>''[[Amnesty International]]'', August 30, 1989. ''Preliminary Findings on Killings of Unarmed Civilians, Arbitrary Arrests and Summary Executions Since June 3, 1989'', p.19</ref>\n\nAfraid that the movement would spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping ordered the Square to be cleared for Gorbachev's visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao again used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}} Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation (not just the government). On the morning of 13 May, [[Yan Mingfu]], head of the Communist Party's [[United Front (China)|United Front]], called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Chen Ziming]] and [[Wang Juntao]].{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=164}} Yan said the government was prepared to hold immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether the students withdraw or not\u2014in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}}\n\n===Mikhail Gorbachev visit===\n{{main|1989 Sino-Soviet Summit}}\nPress restrictions were loosened significantly during early to mid-May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. On 14 May, intellectuals led by [[Dai Qing]] gained permission from [[Hu Qili]] to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals on ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]''. The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the Square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=167}} However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government, and refused to move. That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by [[Shen Tong]] and Xiang Xiaoji. Yan affirmed the patriotic nature of the student movement and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the Square.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=165}} While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership. Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=169}} Yan then personally went to the Square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the April 26 Editorial and rebranding the movement as \"patriotic and democratic\"; Li refused.{{efn|Li, Peng. Diary entry for 15 May.}}\n\nThe students remained in the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, the first of its kind in [[Sino-Soviet split|some 30 years]], marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. However, its smooth proceedings was derailed by the student movement; this created a major embarrassment (\"loss of [[Face (sociological concept)|face]]\"){{sfn|Roberts|2011|p=300}} for the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=170}} The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the [[Great Hall of the People]] amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}} When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. Zhao's defense against this accusation was that privately informing world leaders that Deng was the true center of power was standard operating procedure; Li Peng had made nearly identical private statements to US president [[George H.W. Bush]] in February 1989.{{sfn|Sarotte|2012|p=165}} Nevertheless, the statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.{{sfn|E. Cheng |2009|pp=612\u201314}}\n\n===Gathering momentum===\nThe hunger strike galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from 17\u201318 May. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} Many grassroots Party and [[Communist Youth League|Youth League]] organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng in support of students. The [[Red Cross Society of China|Chinese Red Cross]] issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, giving the movement international spotlight. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.\n\nThe movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained momentum. By 17 May, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not know how to respond. Because the demonstrations now included a wide array of social groups, each carrying its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate, and what the demands were. The government, still split on how to deal with the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=171}} These combined circumstances put immense pressure on the authorities to act, and martial law was discussed as a viable response.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=181}}\n\nThe situation seemed intractable, so the weight of taking decisive action fell on paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Matters came to a head on May 17, during a [[Politburo Standing Committee]] meeting at Deng's residence.{{sfn|Li|2010}} At the meeting, Zhao Ziyang's concessions-based strategy, which called for the retraction of the April 26 Editorial, was thoroughly criticized.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} Li Peng, [[Yao Yilin]] and Deng asserted that by making a conciliatory speech to the [[Asian Development Bank]] on 4 May, Zhao exposed divisions within the top leadership and emboldened the students.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}}{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009|pp=25\u201334}}{{sfn|MacFarquhar|2011|p=443}} Deng warned that \"there is no way to back down now without the situation spiraling out of control\", and so \"the decision is to move troops into Beijing to declare [[martial law]]\"{{sfn|Z. Zhao|2009|p=28}} as a show of the government's no-tolerance stance.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} To justify martial law, the demonstrators were described as tools of \"[[bourgeois liberalism]]\" advocates who were pulling the strings behind the scenes, as well as tools of elements within the party who wished to further their personal ambitions.{{sfn|Miles | 1997}} For the rest of his life, Zhao Ziyang maintained that the decision was ultimately in Deng's hands: among the five PSC members present at the meeting, he and [[Hu Qili]] opposed the imposition of martial law, Li Peng and Yao Yilin firmly supported it, and [[Qiao Shi]] remained carefully neutral and noncommittal. Deng appointed the latter three to carry out the decision.{{sfn|Z. Zhao |2009|p=28\u201330}}\n\n{{quote box|width=40%|align=left|quote=Students, we came too late. We are sorry.

At the meeting, Zhao announced that he was ready to \"take leave\", citing he could not bring himself to carry out martial law.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} The elders in attendance at the meeting, [[Bo Yibo]] and Yang Shangkun, urged the PSC to follow Deng's orders.{{sfn|Nathan|2002|pp=2\u201348}} Zhao did not consider the inconclusive PSC vote to have legally binding implications on martial law;{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=x}} Yang Shangkun, in his capacity as [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], went on to mobilize the military to move into the capital.\n\nLi Peng [[Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement#May 18: meeting with Li Peng|met with students]] for the first time on May 18 in an attempt to placate public concern over the hunger strike.{{sfn|D. Zhao|2001|p=181}} During the talks, student leaders again demanded that the government rescind the April 26 Editorial and affirm the student movement as \"patriotic\". Li Peng said the government's main concern was sending hunger strikers to hospital. The discussions were confrontational and yielded little substantive progress or dialogue,{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=41}} but gained student leaders prominent airtime on national television.{{sfn|Pye|1990|p=343}} By this point, those calling for the overthrow of the party and of Li Peng and Deng personally became prominent both in Beijing and in other cities.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=42-43}} Slogans targeted Deng personally, for instance calling him the \"power behind the throne.\"{{sfn|Wu|2011|p=May 19}}\n\n[[File:Wen Jiabao (Cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wen Jiabao]], then chief of the [[General Office of the Communist Party of China|Party's General Office]], accompanied Zhao Ziyang to meet with students in the Square, surviving the political purge of the party's liberals and later serving as [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] from 2003 to 2013.]]\n\nIn the early morning of 19 May, Zhao Ziyang went to Tiananmen in what became his political [[swan song]]. He was accompanied by [[Wen Jiabao]]. Li Peng also went to the Square, but left shortly thereafter. At 4:50{{nbsp}}am Zhao made a speech with a bullhorn to a crowd of students, urging the students to end the hunger strike.{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=xv}} He told the students that they were still young and urged them to stay healthy and not to sacrifice themselves without due concern for their futures. Zhao's emotional speech was applauded by some students. It would be his last public appearance.{{sfn|Ignatius | 2009 | p=xv}}\n\nOn 19 May, the PSC met with military leaders and party elders. Deng presided over the meeting and said that martial law was the only option. At the meeting Deng declared that he was 'mistaken' in choosing Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang as his successors, and resolved to remove Zhao from his position as general secretary. Deng also vowed to deal resolutely with Zhao's supporters and begin propaganda work.\n\n===Surveillance of protesters===\nStudent leaders were put under close surveillance by the authorities, traffic cameras were used to perform surveillance on the square and the restaurants in the nearby area and where students gathered were wiretapped.<ref name=\"4-corners-tremble-and-obey\">{{Cite episode|episode-link='https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/tremble-and-obey/11174758' |series=Four Coners|title=Tremble & Obey|time=00:24:50}}</ref> This surveillance led to the identification, capture and punishment of participants of the protest.<ref name=\"surveillance-politics\">{{Cite book|first=Richard Victor Ericson|last=Kevin D.

In many cases, these were supported by the universities' own party cells. [[Jiang Zemin]], then-Municipal Party Secretary, addressed the student protesters in a bandage and 'expressed his understanding' as he was a former student agitator before 1949. At the same time, he moved swiftly to send in police forces to control the streets and to purge Communist Party leaders who had supported the students.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nOn April 19, the editors of the ''[[World Economic Herald]]'', a magazine close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu. Inside was an article by [[Yan Jiaqi]], which commented favourably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge. Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, [[Jiang Zemin]] demanded that the article be censored. Many newspapers were printed with a blank page.{{sfn|Wright | 1990 | pp=121\u201332}} Jiang then suspended lead editor [[Qin Benli]].

Tens of thousands of demonstrators surrounded military vehicles, preventing them from either advancing or retreating.

By late May, the students became increasingly disorganized with no clear leadership or unified course of action. Moreover, Tiananmen Square was overcrowded and facing serious hygiene problems. [[Hou Dejian]] suggested an open election of the student leadership to speak for the movement, but was met with opposition.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Meanwhile, [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] moderated his position, ostensibly sensing the impending military action and consequences, and advocated for a temporary withdrawal from Tiananmen Square to re-group on campus, but this was opposed by 'hardliner' student factions who wanted to hold the Square. The increasing internal friction would lead to struggles for control of the loudspeakers in the middle of the square in a series of 'mini-coups': whoever controlled the loudspeakers was 'in charge' of the movement. Some students would wait at the train station to greet arrivals of students from other parts of the country in an attempt to enlist factional support.{{sfn|Gate of Heavenly|1995}} Student groups began accusing each other of ulterior motives such as collusion with the government and trying to gain personal fame from the movement.

By 10:30{{nbsp}}pm, news of bloodshed to the west and south of the city began trickling into the Square, often told by witnesses drenched in blood. At midnight, the students' loudspeaker announced news that a student had been killed on West Chang'an Avenue, near the Military Museum and a somber mood settled on the Square. Li Lu, the deputy commander of the student headquarters, urged students to remain united in defending the Square through non-violent means. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, [[Wu'erkaixi]] fainted after learning that a female student at Beijing Normal University, who had left campus with him earlier in the evening, had just been killed.

At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, two more APCs arrived from the South. The students threw chunks of concrete at the vehicles. One APC stalled, perhaps by metal poles jammed into its wheels, and the demonstrators covered it with gasoline-doused blankets and set it on fire. The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum on the east side of the Square.{{sfn|Wu: Last Act (1)}}\n\nPressure mounted on the student leadership to abandon non-violence and retaliate against the killings.

To purge sympathizers of Tiananmen demonstrators among the party's rank-and-file, the party leadership initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long rectification program to \"deal strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalization\".

In its aftermath, many of the freedoms introduced during the 1980s were rescinded, as the party returned to a conventional Leninist mold and re-established firm control over the press, publishing, and mass media. The protests were also a blow to the separation of powers model established following the Cultural Revolution, whereby the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] was a [[figurehead|symbolic position]], while the real centres of power, i.e., the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] were [[Separation of powers|intended to be different people]], to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule.\n\nWhen President [[Yang Shangkun]] asserted his [[reserve powers]] with his post of [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] and openly split with general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] over the use of force to side with Premier [[Li Peng]] and Central Military Commission chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]], official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. By 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military Commission chairman and President were all consolidated into the same person, a practice that has been continued since.\n\nIn 1989, neither the Chinese military nor the Beijing police had sufficient anti-riot gear, such as rubber bullets and tear gas.{{sfn|MacKinnon | 1999}} After the Tiananmen Square protests, riot police in Chinese cities were equipped with non-lethal equipment for riot control. The protests led to increased spending on internal security and expanded the role of the People's Armed Police in suppressing urban protests.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe restrictions on society were loosened only a few years after the protests, especially after Deng's 1992 \"southern tour\".{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=195}} Privately run print media again flourished. Private newspapers increased from 250 in the 1980s to over 7,000 by 2003.

State-approved religious organizations increased their membership significantly, and traditional beliefs suppressed during the Mao era re-appeared.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=50}} This state-sanctioned plurality also created the environment for unsanctioned forms of spirituality and worship to grow.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}} To reduce the need for controversial methods of state control, while Protestants, Buddhists, and Taoists were largely left alone, the state often used these 'approved' denominations to \"fight against cults\" such as [[Falun Gong]], playing sects off each other.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=52}}\n\nAs the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's \"national pride\", turning domestic public opinion back in its favour.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=201}} This is perhaps most prominently seen in May 1999, when the United States [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]].{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} The bombings saw an outpouring of nationalist sentiment and increased support for the party as the foremost advocate of China's national interest.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}}\n\n===Economic impact===\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests, many analysts downgraded their outlook of China's economic future.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} The violent response to the protests was one of the factors that led to a delay in China's acceptance to the [[World Trade Organization]], which was not completed until twelve years later, in 2001.{{sfn|Naughton|2007}} Furthermore, bilateral aid to China decreased from $3.4&nbsp;billion in 1988 to $700&nbsp;million in 1990.{{sfn|Foot|2000}} Loans to China were suspended by the [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank]], and foreign governments;{{sfn|Thakur | Burton | Srivastava | 1997 | pp=404\u201305}} China's credit rating was lowered;{{sfn|Foot|2000}} tourism revenue decreased from US$2.2&nbsp;billion to US$1.8&nbsp;billion; foreign direct investment commitments were cancelled. There was a rise in defense spending from 8.6% in 1986, to 15.5% in 1990, reversing a previous 10-year decline.{{sfn|Kelley | Shenkar | 1993 | pp=120\u201322}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, the government sought again to centralize control over the economy,{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} though the changes were short-lived.  Sensing that conservative policies had again taken a foothold within the party, Deng, now retired from all of his official positions, launched his \"southern tour\" in 1992, visiting various cities in the country's most prosperous regions while advocating for further economic reforms.{{sfn|Wu | 2015}} Partly in response to Deng, by the mid-1990s, the country was again pursuing market liberalization on a scale even greater than those seen in the initial stages of the reform in the 1980s. Although political liberals were purged within the party, many of those who were economically liberal remained.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}} The economic shocks caused by the events of 1989, in retrospect, had only a minor and temporary effect on China's economic growth. Indeed, with many previously aggrieved groups now regarding political opening as a lost cause, more energy was spent on economic activities. The economy would quickly regain momentum into the 1990s.{{sfn|Naughton|2010}}\n\n===Hong Kong===\n[[File:2009candlevigil1.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Candlelight vigil]] in Hong Kong in 2009 on the 20th anniversary of the June 4th incident]]\nIn Hong Kong, the Tiananmen square protests led to fears that China would renege on its commitments under [[one country, two systems]] following the impending handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997. In response, Governor [[Chris Patten]] tried to expand the [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], which led to friction with Beijing. For many Hong Kongers, Tiananmen served as a turning point for when they lost trust in the Beijing government. The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong|a sizeable exodus of Hong Kongers]] to Western countries such as Canada and Australia prior to 1997.\n\nThere have been [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|large candlelight vigils attended by tens of thousands in Hong Kong every year since 1989]] even after the transfer of power to China in 1997. The [[June 4th Museum]] closed in July 2016, after only two years in its location. The group that runs the museum, the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China|Hong Kong Alliance]], has started to crowdfund money to open the museum in a new location.{{sfn|Kam|2016}}\n\nThe events of Tiananmen in 1989 have become permanently etched in the public consciousness, perhaps more than anywhere else outside mainland China. The events continue to have a strong impact on perceptions of China, its government, attitudes towards democracy, and the extent to which Hong Kongers should identify as \"Chinese.\" The events of June 4 are seen as representative of the Chinese brand of authoritarianism and is often invoked by pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong, especially in relation to democratic reform in Hong Kong and the territory's relationship with Beijing. Academic studies indicate that those who supported the rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square movement had a tendency to support democratization in the territory as well as the election of pro-democracy parties.{{Sfn|Lee|2012|pp=152, 155}}\n\n===Impact on China's national image===\nThe Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests. In its immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a [[pariah state]], increasingly isolated internationally. This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. However, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989.{{sfn|L. Zhang|2001|p=424}} From there on, China would work domestically as well as internationally to reshape its national image from that of a repressive regime to a benign global economic and military partner.{{sfn|Cabestan | 2010 |p= 194}}\n\nIn the 1990s, China attempted to demonstrate its willingness to participate in international economic and defense institutions to secure investment for continued economic reforms.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 19}} The government signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1992, the [[Chemical Weapons Convention|Convention on Chemical Weapons]] in 1993 and the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} Whereas China had been a member of only 30 international organizations in 1986, it was a member of over 50 by 1997.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=198}} China also sought to diversify its external partnerships, establishing good diplomatic relations with post-Soviet Russia,{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} and welcoming Taiwanese business in lieu of Western investment.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=196}} China expedited negotiations with the [[World Trade Organization]] and established relations with Indonesia, Israel, South Korea and others in 1992.{{sfn|Cabestan|2010|p=199}} While China was a net recipient of aid throughout the 1980s, its growing economic and military role transformed it into a net provider of aid.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}\n\nFurthermore, the government has successfully promoted China as an attractive destination for investment by emphasizing the country's skilled workers, comparatively lower wages, established infrastructure, and sizeable consumer base.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=55}} Increased foreign investment in the country led many world leaders to believe that by constructively engaging China in the global marketplace, political reforms would inevitably follow.{{sfn|Link| 2010|p= 30}} At the same time, the explosion of commercial interest in the country opened the way for multinational corporations to turn a blind eye to politics and human rights in favour of focusing on business interests. Since then, Western leaders who were previously critical of China have sometimes paid lip service to the legacy of Tiananmen in bilateral meetings, but the substance of discussions revolved around business and trade interests.{{sfn|Kurlantzick|2003|p=56}}\n\n===European Union and United States arms embargo===\n{{main|European Union arms embargo on the People's Republic of China}}\nThe European Union and United States embargo on armament sales to China, put in place as a result of the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, remains in place today. China has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from European Union members. Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as \"outdated\" and damaging to China\u2013European Union relations. In early 2004, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] spearheaded a movement within the European Union to lift the ban, which was supported by German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]. However, the passing of the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] in March 2005 increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban and several European Union Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban. Moreover, Schr\u00f6der's successor [[Angela Merkel]] opposed lifting the ban. Members of the United States Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the European Union if the latter lifted the ban. The United Kingdom also opposed the lifting of the embargo when it took charge of the European Union presidency in July 2005.\n\nIn addition, the [[European Parliament]] has consistently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo to China. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many argue it reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options from where it may seek military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former [[Soviet bloc]] that it had a strained relationship with as a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.{{sfn|Japan Concerned}}\n\n==Contemporary issues==\n===Censorship in China===\n{{further|Censorship in the People's Republic of China}}\n{{see also|Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China#Specific examples of internet censorship|l1=Internet censorship of the protest}}\nThe [[Communist Party of China]] forbids discussion of the Tiananmen Square protests{{sfn|Saiget |2009}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2020|reason=Made taboo not forbidden}}\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems|title=One App, Two Systems|at=figure 9|access-date=September 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010221114/https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems/|archive-date=October 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2020|reason=App censors this, but that doesn't mean it's forbidden, or even that this is because the Communist Party directly}} and has taken measures to block or censor related information.

The government also announced it had seized 32&nbsp;million contraband books and 2.4&nbsp;million video and audio cassettes.{{sfn|Pei | 1994 | p=152}} Access to media and Internet resources on the subject are restricted or blocked by censors.{{sfn|Zetter|2009}} Banned literature and films include ''[[Summer Palace (2006 film)|Summer Palace]]'',{{sfn|Higgins | 2006}} ''[[Forbidden City (novel)|Forbidden City]]'', ''[[Collection of June Fourth Poems]]'',{{sfn|Ban on Poems}} ''[[The Critical Moment]]: Li Peng diaries'' and any writings of Zhao Ziyang or his aide [[Bao Tong]], including [[Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang|Zhao's memoirs]].

Many young people born after 1980 are unfamiliar with the events and are apathetic about politics.

The payment was termed a \"hardship assistance\", given to Tang Deying ({{lang|zh|\u5510\u5fb7\u82f1}}) whose son Zhou Guocong ({{zh|s=\u5468\u56fd\u806a|t=\u5468\u570b\u8070}}) died at age 15 years while in police custody in [[Chengdu]] on June 6, 1989, two days after the Chinese Army dispersed the Tiananmen protesters.
