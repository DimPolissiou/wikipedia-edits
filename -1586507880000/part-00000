As Turbo Prolog, it was marketed by [[Borland]] but it is now developed and marketed by the Danish firm Prolog Development Center (PDC) that originally developed it. Visual Prolog can build [[Microsoft Windows]] [[GUI]]-applications, [[console application]]s, [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]]s (dynamic link libraries), and [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]]-programs. It can also link to [[Component Object Model|COM components]] and to [[database]]s by means of [[Open Database Connectivity|ODBC]].\n\nLogic languages are traditionally [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]], but Visual Prolog is [[compiled]]. This provides the important improvement of converting traditional Prolog-typical [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]] errors to compiler warnings, which ensures a better [[Robustness (computer science)|robustness]] of the finished applications.\n\nThe core of Visual Prolog are [[Horn clause]]s, [[algebraic datatypes]], [[pattern matching]] and controlled [[Nondeterministic algorithm|non-determinism]] like in traditional Prolog, but unlike traditional Prolog, Visual Prolog has always been [[Data type|strongly and statically typed]].\n\n== History ==\n\nVersion 9 introduces bounded polymorphism, extension predicates, threadsafe lock free fact databases, named parameters (see also [https://wiki.visual-prolog.com/index.php?title=Visual_Prolog_9_New_Features Visual Prolog 9 New Features]).\n\nVersion 8 introduces presenters, for more user friendly data presentation in debugger and running program (see also [https://wiki.visual-prolog.com/index.php?title=Visual_Prolog_8_New_Features Visual Prolog 8 New Features]).\n\nVersion 7.5 contains http server and LALR(1) parser generator (see also [https://wiki.visual-prolog.com/index.php?title=Visual_Prolog_7.5_New_Features Visual Prolog 7.5 New Features]).\n\nVersion 7.4 can generate 64 bit windows code (see also [https://wiki.visual-prolog.com/index.php?title=Visual_Prolog_7.4_New_Features Visual Prolog 7.4 New Features]).\n\nVersion 7.3 introduced generic classes and interfaces (see [[Generic programming]]), guarded [[Monitor (synchronization)|monitors]] (see also [https://wiki.visual-prolog.com/index.php?title=Visual_Prolog_7.3_New_Features Visual Prolog 7.3 New Features]).\n\nVersion 7.2 introduced anonymous predicates (a logical pendant to [[anonymous functions]]) and namespaces (see also [https://wiki.visual-prolog.com/index.php?title=Visual_Prolog_7.2_New_Features Visual Prolog 7.2 New Features]).\n\nVersion 7.0 introduced [[Type polymorphism#Parametric polymorphism|parametric polymorphism]].\n\nSince version 6.0 the language has been fully [[object-oriented (programming)|object-oriented]].\n\n==Hanoi example==\n\nIn the [[Towers of Hanoi]] example, the Prolog inference engine figures out how to move a stack of any number of progressively smaller disks, one at a time, from the left pole to the right pole in the described way, by means of a center as transit, so that there's never a bigger disk on top of a smaller disk.

He liked the user interface and low price, and reported that two [[BYU]] professors stated that it was superior to the Prolog they used at the university.
