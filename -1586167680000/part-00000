Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bison represent [[North Dakota State University]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Summit League]].\n\nNorth Dakota State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1897.<ref name=\"MG\" /> However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\n\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983\u201384 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985\u201386 season, but North Dakota State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the [[2019\u201320 North Dakota State Bison men's basketball team|2019\u201320]] season.\n\n==Scoring==\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n{|

Advanced Pain Care advocates the appropriate and effective management of chronic pain through a multi-disciplinary approach by board-certified professionals.\n\nThis includes pharmaceutical pain remediation and non-pharmaceutical treatments, including implantable spinal cord stimulators, radiofrequency ablation, and psychological support.\n\n= History =\n\nAdvanced Pain Care was founded by anesthesiologist and pain management physician Mark T. Malone, M.D. in 2002.\n\n= Locations =\n\nAdvanced Pain Care currently has 11 clinic locations in Texas, including Amarillo (2 locations), Austin (3 locations), Bastrop, Cedar Park, Georgetown, Killeen, Round Rock, and Waco.\n\nAdvanced Pain Care also has two ambulatory surgical centers, Advanced Surgical Center in Amarillo and Round Rock Surgery Center in Round Rock, Texas.\n\n= Services Offered =\n\n== Information on Pain Treatments Provided by Advanced Pain Care ==\n=== Spinal Cord Stimulation ===\nSpinal cord stimulation also referred to as neurostimulation therapy, is used by Advanced Pain Care to send electrical signals to the area surrounding the spinal cord as a relief measure most often for lower back pain and leg pain.\n\n=== Epidural Steroid Injection ===\nAdvanced Pain Care uses this non-surgical, injectable mix of anaesthetic and steroid most often to treat lower back pain and sciatica pain.\n\n=== Implantable Morphine Pumps ===\nMorphine pumps are a type of intrathecal pump used by Advanced Pain Care to treat chronic pain via delivery of morphine to the patient's spinal fluid.\n\n=== Pharmacologic treatment ===\nAdvanced Pain Care physicians will prescribe prescription-strength pain medication to their patients based on an as-necessary protocol. That includes non-opioids, opioids and co-analgesics and both prescription and non-prescription pharmaceuticals. Before prescribing pain medication, physicians gather the important history of the patient including age, coexisting diseases, other medications currently being taken, preferences, responses to previous treatments, allergies, an accumulation of toxic metabolites and evaluation for addiction potential. Once all factors have been examined, the pain care team establishes a management plan.\n\n=== Precision Nerve Injections ===\nAdvanced Pain Care also uses precision nerve injections, which consist of a combination of local anaesthetic and a steroid injected via x-ray guidance, in treatment of neck pain or back pain.\n\n=== Psychological Support ===\nPsychological Support is part of Advanced Pain Care's standard practice and includes a brief clinical interview with the patient to determine, specifically, whether or not the patient is experiencing depression, anxiety, fear and avoidance behaviours that may impact the patient's pain and the potential for prescription abuse. This also assists in determining whether or not the patient understands the purpose of and the appropriate use of medications, and compliance with physician recommendations.\n\n=== Radiofrequency Ablation ===\nAnother minimally invasive procedure used by pain management specialists at Advanced Pain Care includes radiofrequency ablation, a heat-generating radio wave that removes nerve tissue to decrease pain signals from that area.\n\n== Information on Neurosurgery Services Provided by Advanced Pain Care ==\nAdvanced Pain Care offers neurosurgical services for pain relief, specifically for spinal disorders such as herniated discs and spinal stenosis. It is also used for peripheral nerve disorders and includes carpal tunnel release and ulnar nerve decompressions and transpositions as treatment measures.\n\n== Information on Rheumatology Services Provided by Advanced Pain Care ==\nAdvanced Pain Care treats rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and psoriatic arthritis using an array of treatments which include medication, joint injections, aspirations, or infusions.\n\n{{Uncategorized|date=April 2020}}\n", "text_old": "{{db-corp}}\n\nAdvanced Pain Care is a Pain Management, Neurosurgery, and Rheumatology medical practice based in Texas.

It is also used for peripheral nerve disorders and includes carpal tunnel release and ulnar nerve decompressions and transpositions as treatment measures.\n\n== Information on Rheumatology Services Provided by Advanced Pain Care ==\n\nAdvanced Pain Care treats rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and psoriatic arthritis using an array of treatments which include medication, joint injections, aspirations, or infusions.\n", "name_user": "Jamesmcmahon0", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, addedorphan,uncategorisedtags,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Pain_Care"}

The ships' activities inspired the name V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, which means \"[[wikt:anchorage|anchorage]]\". The [[French Indochina|French Indochinese]] government named it '''Cap Saint-Jacques''' (\"Cap Xanh Giac\", in Vietnamese). The cliff of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u is now called M\u0169i Nghinh Phong (literally meaning \"''Cape of breeze welcome''\" or ''\"Cape of greeting the wind''\").\n\nV\u0169ng T\u00e0u was originally referred to as Tam Th\u1eafng (\"Three Boats\") in memory of the first three villages in this  area: Th\u1eafng Nh\u1ea5t, Th\u1eafng Nh\u1ecb, Th\u1eafng Tam, within the province of [[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a]] under the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]]. Under the reign of king [[Gia Long]] (1761\u20131820), when [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] pirates built a base here and subsequently became a danger to traders in [[Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh]] city, the king sent his army to crack down on the pirates. The pirates were ousted and the troops were given the land as a reward. 10 February 1859 marked the first use of cannons by Nguy\u1ec5n's army, when they fired at French battleships from the fortress of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Th\u1eafng, located 100m from V\u0169ng T\u00e0u's Front Beach. This marked an important period in Vietnam's war against French invaders in South Vietnam (then called [[Cochinchina]]).\n\nIn 1876, according to a decree by the French government, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u was merged in [[B\u00e0 R\u1ecba|B\u00e0 R\u1ecba county]] per [[Saigon]]'s administration. During the 1880s there were talks about moving Saigon's port facilities to V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, but this came to nothing due to Saigon's better infrastructure.<ref>''Saigon: A History'', p. 82, by Nghia M. Vo (2011): \"There were talks about moving the port facilities to V\u0169ng T\u00e0u at the mouth of the river where ...\"</ref>\n\nOn 1 May 1895, the governor of Cochinchina established by decree that Cap Saint Jacques would thereafter be an autonomous town. In 1898, Cap Saint Jacques was merged with B\u00e0 R\u1ecba county once again, but re-divided in 1899. In 1901, the population of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u was 5,690, of which 2,000 persons were immigrants from [[North Vietnam]]. Most of the town's population made their living in the dancing industry. On 4 April 1905, Cap Saint Jacques was made an administrative district of B\u00e0 R\u1ecba province. In 1929, Cap Saint Jacques became a province, and in 1934 became a city (commune). The French governor of [[French Indochina|Indochina]], [[Paul Doumer]] (who later became President of France), built a mansion in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u that is still a prominent landmark.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], the [[1st Australian Logistics Support Group]] was headquartered in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u &ndash; as were various United States military units at different times. V\u0169ng T\u00e0u also became popular for [[R&R (military)|R&R]], amongst in-country US, Australian and New Zealand personnel.<ref>Keith W. Nolan.

On 30 May 1979, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u town was made the capital of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u-C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Special Administrative Zone. On 12 August 1991, [[B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province]] was officially founded and V\u0169ng T\u00e0u town officially became V\u0169ng T\u00e0u City. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==Economy and tourism==\n===Shipping and oil exploration===\nThe city is located in the south of Vietnam, situated at the tip of a small [[peninsula]]. It has traditionally been a significant port, particularly during Vietnam's period of [[French Indochina|French rule]]. Today, the city's importance as a shipping port has diminished, but it still plays a significant role in Vietnam's offshore [[petroleum|oil]] industry. V\u0169ng T\u00e0u is the only petroleum base of Vietnam where [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] exploitation activities dominate the city's economy and contribute principal income to [[Economy of Vietnam|Vietnam's budget]] and export volume.

The ships' activities inspired the name V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, which means \"[[wikt:anchorage|anchorage]]\". The [[French Indochina|French Indochinese]] government named it '''Cap Saint-Jacques''' (\"Cap Xanh Giac\", in Vietnamese). The cliff of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u is now called M\u0169i Nghinh Phong (literally meaning \"''Cape of breeze welcome''\" or ''\"Cape of greeting the wind''\").\n\nV\u0169ng T\u00e0u was originally referred to as Tam Th\u1eafng (\"Three Boats\") in memory of the first three villages in this  area: Th\u1eafng Nh\u1ea5t, Th\u1eafng Nh\u1ecb, Th\u1eafng Tam, within the province of [[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a]] under the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]]. Under the reign of king [[Gia Long]] (1761\u20131820), when [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] pirates built a base here and subsequently became a danger to traders in [[Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh]] city, the king sent his army to crack down on the pirates. The pirates were ousted and the troops were given the land as a reward. 10 February 1859 marked the first use of cannons by Nguy\u1ec5n's army, when they fired at French battleships from the fortress of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Th\u1eafng, located 100m from V\u0169ng T\u00e0u's Front Beach. This marked an important period in Vietnam's war against French invaders in South Vietnam (then called [[Cochinchina]]).\n\nIn 1876, according to a decree by the French government, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u was merged in [[B\u00e0 R\u1ecba|B\u00e0 R\u1ecba county]] per [[Saigon]]'s administration. During the 1880s there were talks about moving Saigon's port facilities to V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, but this came to nothing due to Saigon's better infrastructure.<ref>''Saigon: A History'', p. 82, by Nghia M. Vo (2011): \"There were talks about moving the port facilities to V\u0169ng T\u00e0u at the mouth of the river where ...\"</ref>\n\nOn 1 May 1895, the governor of Cochinchina established by decree that Cap Saint Jacques would thereafter be an autonomous town. In 1898, Cap Saint Jacques was merged with B\u00e0 R\u1ecba county once again, but re-divided in 1899. In 1901, the population of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u was 5,690, of which 2,000 persons were immigrants from [[North Vietnam]]. Most of the town's population made their living in the dancing industry. On 4 April 1905, Cap Saint Jacques was made an administrative district of B\u00e0 R\u1ecba province. In 1929, Cap Saint Jacques became a province, and in 1934 became a city (commune). The French governor of [[French Indochina|Indochina]], [[Paul Doumer]] (who later became President of France), built a mansion in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u that is still a prominent landmark.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], the [[1st Australian Logistics Support Group]] was headquartered in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u &ndash; as were various United States military units at different times. V\u0169ng T\u00e0u also became popular for [[R&R (military)|R&R]], amongst in-country US, Australian and New Zealand personnel.<ref>Keith W. Nolan. ''Search and Destroy: The Story of an Armored Cavalry Squadron'' 2010, p. 35: \"Harrington anticipated rendezvousing with his vehicles, supplies, and troops at the port city of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u in III Corps, then launching operations north-west of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n with the 25th Division.\"</ref>\n\nAfter the war, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u was a common launching place for the \"[[Vietnamese boat people]]\" fleeing the communists. On 30 May 1979, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u town was made the capital of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u-C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Special Administrative Zone. On 12 August 1991, [[B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province]] was officially founded and V\u0169ng T\u00e0u town officially became V\u0169ng T\u00e0u City. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==Economy and tourism==\n===Shipping and oil exploration===\nThe city is located in the south of Vietnam, situated at the tip of a small [[peninsula]]. It has traditionally been a significant port, particularly during Vietnam's period of [[French Indochina|French rule]]. Today, the city's importance as a shipping port has diminished, but it still plays a significant role in Vietnam's offshore [[petroleum|oil]] industry. V\u0169ng T\u00e0u is the only petroleum base of Vietnam where [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] exploitation activities dominate the city's economy and contribute principal income to [[Economy of Vietnam|Vietnam's budget]] and export volume.

[[Mahayana Buddhism]], the dominant form of the religion in Vietnam, was brought to B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u by the Vietnamese settlers from the north at the beginning of the 17th century during the expansion of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]]. When they came bringing their original religion they built many Buddhist pagodas, temples and statues in the city. Three Buddhist temples in particular, [[Th\u00edch Ca Ph\u1eadt \u0110\u00e0i]], Ph\u1ed5 \u0110\u00e0 S\u01a1n Quan \u00c2m B\u1ed3 T\u00e1t T\u1ef1 Temple, and Ni\u1ebft B\u00e0n T\u1ecbnh X\u00e1 temple, draw pilgrims from around the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beliefs in Vung Tau|work=Ba Ria-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Tourism|url=http://bariavungtautourism.com/index.php?option=com_pages&id=21&Itemid=25&language=2}}</ref>\n\nBefore the area was settled by ethnic Vietnamese, the Khmer people practiced [[Theravada Buddhism]].
