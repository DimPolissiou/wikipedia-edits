Although both were originally small schools, many alumni have made significant contributions to the Nation, in politics, in academia, education and health services, in business and as musicians and artists.  Many are mentioned in the book.\n\nThere is also Mainly About Girls, A History of Queen\u2019s, Ballarat 1876 \u2013 1972 written by Susanne White and Winds of Influence, A History of Ballarat Grammar 1911 \u2013 1971 by Michael Boyle.\n\n==Headmasters==\n''Adam Heath'' has been the Headmaster since 2016.

The expansive campus stretches as far north as Norman St, and west towards Dare St. Both the ''Senior School'' and ''Junior School'' are situated on the same campus, sharing many facilities and resources. ''The Wendouree Centre for Performing Arts'' is accessed by students via the southern part of the campus, and by the general public via Howitt St.\n\n''The Wendouree Centre for Performing Arts (WCPA)'' was opened in 2006 through a partnership between the School and the wider Ballarat Community. The main auditorium seats 857 and the expansive stage area has the capacity to handle a range of performances. It is used by the School and also hosts community events and performances. Ballarat Grammar's ''Music School'' is located within the WCPA, featuring tutorial and rehearsal rooms, and a professional recording suite. The WCPA also features natural cooling using the catacombs and natural air-flow.\n\n''The Heinz Centre'' is an award-winning (2002 BEN Environment Award<ref name=\"ENDAward1\">[http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=2002_Environment_Awards 2002 BEN Environment Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080811074454/http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=2002_Environment_Awards |date=11 August 2008 }} (accessed:20-07-2008)</ref> ) Year 9 Environmental Centre, opened in 2001.

The Ballarat Associated Schools (BAS) crews compete in the annual \"Head of the Lake\", which is held at [[Lake Wendouree]].\n\nThe Ballarat Grammar Senior Girls Australian Rules Football team has had great success in recent years, winning the Ballarat Associated Schools (BAS) Premiership every year since 2013. Coached by teacher Matt Hanlon, the team was first successful in the AFL Victoria Herald Sun Shield (HSS) Championship in 2014, where they claimed the School Girls Division 1 title. In 2015, the girls contested against [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies College]] at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] but lost in a close match, however it is worthy to note that the best on ground for that game was Rene Caris who was drafted to the Geelong Football Club in the 2018 AFLW Draft. In 2016 and 2017, the Ballarat Grammar Senior Girls Football team triumphed in the Herald Sun Shield claiming Division 1 titles in successive years at RAMS Arena and the MCG respectfully. In 2017, Lauren Butler, who was drafted to the Collingwood Football Club in the 2018 AFLW Draft, was named best on ground in the Herald Sun Shield Grandfinal. In 2018, the team was unsuccessful in the Herald Sun Shield Grandfinal, where they were beaten by Hallam Secondary College at GMHBA Stadium, Geelong. \n\nThe Ballarat Grammar Athletic team has in recent years been successful, with the Senior Boys Athletics Team taking out the 2012 All Schools Knockout title.\n\n==House system==\n\nThe [[house system]] is very important to the structure of the school, and there is substantial rivalry between houses in swimming, athletics, choral competitions, and more. The house system also provides pastoral care and a degree of mentoring to students.  The rivalry is particularly seen between the two boys' boarding houses, Dart and Wigan, which often used to engage in pranks against each other. This practice was abandoned in 2007 after new administration deemed the activities of the boarding houses to be inappropriate. Dart and Wigan still compete against each other in [[soccer]] and [[Australian rules football]] matches. These houses used to be one, and their subsequent division may be the cause of the competition. The Dart-Wigan rivalry is often overlooked when competing against the \"day\" (non-boarding) houses.\n\nThere are also three girls' boarding houses, Hayhoe, Woodbridge and Larritt. Larritt was created to accommodate the ever-increasing number of boarders, housing exclusively female boarders in years 7, 8 and 9. Larritt girls 'graduate' to Hayhoe and Woodbridge when they reach year 10.\n\nThere are also eight day houses, four for girls and four for boys. The girls' day houses are Manifold, Krome, Cuthbert and Macpherson. The boys' houses are Smith, Butler, Robin and Nevett.\n\nAll houses are named after people who were important to the school such as former Headmasters/Headmistresses or substantial donors, and are paired in brother-sister groups. While the houses are generally independent, they compete together in a number of competitions.\n\nThe pairs are:\n\n* pherson {{color box|white}}{{color box|red}} \u2013 vett {{color box|lightblue}}{{color box|maroon}}{{color box|white}}\n* Manifold {{color box|navy}}{{color box|gold}} \u2013 Smith {{color box|cream}}{{color box|navy}}\n* Woodbridge {{color box|lightblue}}{{color box|maroon}}{{color box|white}} \u2013 Dart {{color box|red}}{{color box|navy}}\n* Hayhoe {{color box|green}}{{color box|blue}} \u2013 Wigan {{color box|navy}}{{color box|gold}}\n* Cuthbert {{color box|purple}}{{color box|crimson}} \u2013 Robin  {{color box|gold}}{{color box|red}}\n* Krome {{color box|green}}{{color box|gold}} \u2013 Butt {{color box|brown}}{{color box|brown}}\n* Larritt {{colour box|maroon}}{{colour box|gold}}\n\n== Chapel of St Mark ==\nLocated within the School grounds is the Chapel of St Mark.  Originally built as the School assembly hall (Manifold Hall), the building was transformed into a chapel when student numbers demanded a larger space.  Overseen by Senior Chaplain, the Revd Dr Timothy Gaden, the Chapel holds several school services each week. The services are open to students of all faiths and acknowledge the liturgical traditions and inclusive, sacramental and life-affirming theology of the Anglican Church of Australia. Baptisms, weddings and funerals for school families and the wider community are also regularly held in the Chapel of St Mark.\n\nNotably, each winter the Chapel plays host to the charitable drive ''Can the Chapel''.  School houses compete to donate non-perishable items, lining the walls (and aisles) of the Chapel. All proceeds are donated to Anglicare Ballarat, and distributed to the needy within the Ballarat community.\n\n==Alumni==\n{{main cat|People educated at Ballarat Grammar School}}\n\n;Academia\n*[[G.

The expansive campus stretches as far north as Norman St, and west towards Dare St. Both the ''Senior School'' and ''Junior School'' are situated on the same campus, sharing many facilities and resources. ''The Wendouree Centre for Performing Arts'' is accessed by students via the southern part of the campus, and by the general public via Howitt St.\n\n''The Wendouree Centre for Performing Arts (WCPA)'' was opened in 2006 through a partnership between the School and the wider Ballarat Community. The main auditorium seats 857 and the expansive stage area has the capacity to handle a range of performances. It is used by the School and also hosts community events and performances. Ballarat Grammar's ''Music School'' is located within the WCPA, featuring tutorial and rehearsal rooms, and a professional recording suite. The WCPA also features natural cooling using the catacombs and natural air-flow.\n\n''The Heinz Centre'' is an award-winning (2002 BEN Environment Award<ref name=\"ENDAward1\">[http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=2002_Environment_Awards 2002 BEN Environment Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080811074454/http://bird.net.au/bird/index.php?title=2002_Environment_Awards |date=11 August 2008 }} (accessed:20-07-2008)</ref> ) Year 9 Environmental Centre, opened in 2001.

The Ballarat Associated Schools (BAS) crews compete in the annual \"Head of the Lake\", which is held at [[Lake Wendouree]].\n\nThe Ballarat Grammar Senior Girls Australian Rules Football team has had great success in recent years, winning the Ballarat Associated Schools (BAS) Premiership every year since 2013. Coached by teacher Matt Hanlon, the team was first successful in the AFL Victoria Herald Sun Shield (HSS) Championship in 2014, where they claimed the School Girls Division 1 title. In 2015, the girls contested against [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies College]] at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] but lost in a close match, however it is worthy to note that the best on ground for that game was Rene Caris who was drafted to the Geelong Football Club in the 2018 AFLW Draft. In 2016 and 2017, the Ballarat Grammar Senior Girls Football team triumphed in the Herald Sun Shield claiming Division 1 titles in successive years at RAMS Arena and the MCG respectfully. In 2017, Lauren Butler, who was drafted to the Collingwood Football Club in the 2018 AFLW Draft, was named best on ground in the Herald Sun Shield Grandfinal. In 2018, the team was unsuccessful in the Herald Sun Shield Grandfinal, where they were beaten by Hallam Secondary College at GMHBA Stadium, Geelong. \n\nThe Ballarat Grammar Athletic team has in recent years been successful, with the Senior Boys Athletics Team taking out the 2012 All Schools Knockout title.\n\n==House system==\n\nThe [[house system]] is very important to the structure of the school, and there is substantial rivalry between houses in swimming, athletics, choral competitions, and more. The house system also provides pastoral care and a degree of mentoring to students.  The rivalry is particularly seen between the two boys' boarding houses, Dart and Wigan, which often used to engage in pranks against each other. This practice was abandoned in 2007 after new administration deemed the activities of the boarding houses to be inappropriate. Dart and Wigan still compete against each other in [[soccer]] and [[Australian rules football]] matches. These houses used to be one, and their subsequent division may be the cause of the competition. The Dart-Wigan rivalry is often overlooked when competing against the \"day\" (non-boarding) houses.\n\nThere are also three girls' boarding houses, Hayhoe, Woodbridge and Larritt. Larritt was created to accommodate the ever-increasing number of boarders, housing exclusively female boarders in years 7, 8 and 9. Larritt girls 'graduate' to Hayhoe and Woodbridge when they reach year 10.\n\nThere are also eight day houses, four for girls and four for boys. The girls' day houses are Manifold, Krome, Cuthbert and Macpherson. The boys' houses are Smith, Butler, Robin and Nevett.\n\nAll houses are named after people who were important to the school such as former Headmasters/Headmistresses or substantial donors, and are paired in brother-sister groups. While the houses are generally independent, they compete together in a number of competitions.\n\nThe pairs are:\n\n* Macpherson {{color box|white}}{{color box|red}} \u2013 Nevett {{color box|lightblue}}{{color box|maroon}}{{color box|white}}\n* Manifold {{color box|navy}}{{color box|gold}} \u2013 Smith {{color box|cream}}{{color box|navy}}\n* Woodbridge {{color box|lightblue}}{{color box|maroon}}{{color box|white}} \u2013 Dart {{color box|red}}{{color box|navy}}\n* Hayhoe {{color box|green}}{{color box|blue}} \u2013 Wigan {{color box|navy}}{{color box|gold}}\n* Cuthbert {{color box|purple}}{{color box|crimson}} \u2013 Robin  {{color box|gold}}{{color box|red}}\n* Krome {{color box|green}}{{color box|gold}} \u2013 Butler {{color box|green}}{{color box|gold}}\n* Larritt {{colour box|maroon}}{{colour box|gold}}\n\n== Chapel of St Mark ==\nLocated within the School grounds is the Chapel of St Mark.  Originally built as the School assembly hall (Manifold Hall), the building was transformed into a chapel when student numbers demanded a larger space.  Overseen by Senior Chaplain, the Revd Dr Timothy Gaden, the Chapel holds several school services each week. The services are open to students of all faiths and acknowledge the liturgical traditions and inclusive, sacramental and life-affirming theology of the Anglican Church of Australia. Baptisms, weddings and funerals for school families and the wider community are also regularly held in the Chapel of St Mark.\n\nNotably, each winter the Chapel plays host to the charitable drive ''Can the Chapel''.  School houses compete to donate non-perishable items, lining the walls (and aisles) of the Chapel. All proceeds are donated to Anglicare Ballarat, and distributed to the needy within the Ballarat community.\n\n==Alumni==\n{{main cat|People educated at Ballarat Grammar School}}\n\n;Academia\n*[[G.

The character was created by [[Sylvester Stallone]], who also portrayed him in all eight ''Rocky'' films. He is depicted as an [[everyman]] who started out by going the distance and overcoming obstacles that had occurred in his life and career as a professional [[boxer]]. While the story of his first film is loosely inspired by that of [[Chuck Wepner]], a one-time boxer who fought [[Muhammad Ali]] and lost on a TKO in the 15th round, the inspiration for the name, iconography and fighting style came from boxing legend [[Rocky Marciano|Rocco Francis \"Rocky Marciano\" Marchegiano]], though his surname coincidentally also resembles that of Middleweight Boxing Champion [[Rocky Graziano|Thomas Rocco \"Rocky Graziano\" Barbella]].\n\nThe character is widely considered to be Stallone's most iconic role and is often considered the role that started his film career. He received critical acclaim for his performance in the first movie, earning [[Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations. When Stallone reprised his role once again in 2015 for ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'', his performance received wide acclaim and he received his first [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor]], along with his third Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and several other accolades.\n\n==Biography==\nRobbing \"Ricky\" Bilbao was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], on July 6, 1945. He was the only child in a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Italian-American]] family. However, the surname Bilbao (roughly meaning \"beautiful valley\") originates from a [[Balboa, Le\u00f3n|Galician-speaking town in northwestern Spain]]. When Rocky is spoken to by his priest, Father Carmine, it is apparent that he understands Italian very well, including a scene in which he translates for Tommy Gunn. It is undetermined how well he actually speaks the language, as his responses are always in English.\n\nDuring the scene in which Rocky takes Adrianna \"Adrian\" Pennino skating on Thanksgiving, he tells her, \"Yeah \u2013 My old man, who was never the sharpest, told me I weren't born with much brain, so I better use my body.\" This encouraged him to take up boxing. He trained very hard so he could grow up to be like his idol [[Rocky Marciano]]. Unable to live on the low pay of club fights, and being unable to find work anywhere else, Rocky got a job as a collector for Tony Gazzo, the local loan shark, just to make ends meet. By late 1975, Rocky had fought in 64 fights, winning 44 (38 KO'S) and losing 20. Rocky was proud that he never had his nose broken in any of his ametuer fighting career. His nickname is \"The Italian Stallion\", spawning from his Italian-American heritage.\n\n===''[[Rocky]]'' (setting 1975\u20131976)===\nThe film begins on November 25, 1975, in the slums of the [[Kensington, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Kensington]] section of [[Philadelphia]]. Rocky Balboa is fighting Spider Rico in a local boxing ring called the Cambria Fight Club (nicknamed \"The Bucket of Blood\") inside a chapel. In the second round, Rico hits Balboa with a headbutt, leaving a gash on his forehead. Rocky then delivers a vicious barrage of punches, knocking Rico out. The next day, Rocky stops by the J&M Tropical Fish pet shop, where he meets Adrian Pennino. Adrian is very shy and scared of Rocky's tough appearance. Afterward, Rocky goes to collect a loan for his loan shark boss, Tony Gazzo. Even though the client, Bob, does not have all the money, Rocky does not break his thumbs, even though Gazzo had ordered him to do so. Later, Rocky stops by the local boxing gym and finds out that his locker has been replaced by another local contender. Unknown to him, the gym's owner and grizzled former boxer, [[Mickey Goldmill]], does not dislike him, but considers Rocky's potential to be better than his effort. When Rocky leaves for home that night, he sees a young girl named Marie hanging around a bad crowd and walks her home. On the way, Rocky lectures her about staying away from the wrong people. However, once they get to her house, she tells Rocky \"Screw you, creep'o\". Rocky walks home, frustrated how nothing is going right in his life.\n\nRocky gets his dream come true when the undisputed World Heavyweight Champion, [[Apollo Creed]], decides that he wants to give an unknown fighter a chance to fight for the title after his intended challenger, Mac Lee Green, broke his hand while training. Creed was told that no other contender was available for a fight on New Years Day. Creed chooses Rocky because he likes Balboa's nickname, 'The Italian Stallion'.\n\nAfter getting picked by Creed, Rocky reunites with his estranged trainer, who convinces Rocky that he can help prepare him for the match. Mickey reveals that his career never got anywhere because he did not have a manager and he does not want the same thing to happen to Rocky. At the same time, Rocky begins dating Adrian. Rocky helps Adrian to become more self-confident and stand up for herself. Rocky confides in Adrian before the fight that, although he figures that he may not win, he wants to at least \"[[The distance (boxing)|go the distance]].\"\n\nOn January 1, 1976, at the [[Philadelphia Spectrum]], Rocky has his match with Creed, who did not take the fight seriously during training. In the first round, Rocky knocks Creed down, the first time he had ever been knocked down in his career and Creed breaks Rocky's nose, also for the first time in his career. Creed soon realizes that, although Rocky does not have his level of skills, he could deliver crippling, sledge-hammer like punches and is determined to keep fighting. The match becomes a long and grueling battle for both competitors. Up into the 14th round, Rocky is nearly knocked down but manages to get back up and delivers some hard body shots, breaking Creed's ribs just before the bell rings. The 15th round comes to naught and Rocky manages to pummel Creed until the bell rings once more. It is the first time an opponent had lasted the full 15 rounds against him and as a result, it ends up with a [[split decision]], Creed wins the fight and holds on to his title. Both combatants, battered beyond belief, agree that there would be no rematch. Rocky clearly doesn't mind about the outcome, as he only wanted to go the distance with Creed. After the match, Adrian climbs into the ring and embraces Rocky saying, \"I love you!\"\n\n===''[[Rocky II]]'' (setting 1976)===\nAfter the match, Creed changes his mind and demands a rematch under the stress of being humiliated by the press for failing to beat Rocky convincingly, as well as his own knowledge that he didn't give his best in the match. Creed demands a rematch with Rocky, stating that he would fight him 'anywhere, anyplace, anytime' to prove to the world that Rocky's feat was merely a fluke. Rocky initially declines and retires from boxing, having surgery for [[retinal detachment]], a condition that could lead to permanent blindness. He marries Adrian, who convinces him to live outside boxing. However, Rocky, a grade-school drop-out, soon realizes that he has no white-collar skills beyond the eighth grade and, in fact, has dyslexia. The money he made in his match with Creed is easily and quickly frittered away, so Adrian re-claims her part-time job at the J&M Tropical Fish pet shop. At first, Rocky seems to be unaffected by Creed's smear campaign, but his inexperience with money causes him to run into financial troubles. Rocky struggles to find employment with decent pay, when he is fired from a commercial studio, turned down for an office job and even laid off at the Shamrock meat packing facility. Despite Adrian's objections, and after Creed insults Rocky on national television and the newspaper, he agrees to the rematch. Without Adrian's support, however, Rocky becomes greatly discouraged and cannot concentrate on his training whatsoever, leaving Mick frustrated and worried. The now-pregnant Adrian goes into preterm labor on the job due to stress and slips into a coma after giving birth to her first child, Robert Jr. When Adrian is out of the coma, she promises her full support to Rocky. Together, Mickey and Rocky train hard, focusing on Rocky's speed and improving his right-handed punching (Rocky being a [[southpaw stance|southpaw]]). At the same time, Creed is also focused on his training, taking this match much more seriously than the previous time. The rematch is set for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. The match goes on for the full 15 rounds again, with both Rocky and Creed falling to the canvas after Rocky lands a succession of left hands. As referee Lou Fillipo exercises his 10-count to the limit, both Creed and Rocky struggle to get back up and Creed falls back down in exhaustion. Rocky is able to get back up from sheer determination, beating the 10-count and winning the rematch by knockout, thus becoming heavyweight champion of the world.\n\n===''[[Rocky III]]'' (setting 1976\u20131979)===\nOver the next three years, Rocky has successfully defended his title in ten consecutive matches against various contenders, amassing a wealthy fortune and worldwide fame in the process. In addition, Rocky also has an exhibition match against the World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion, \"Thunderlips\" ([[Hulk Hogan]]), with the match ending in a draw. However, in 1981, Rocky is challenged by a power-hungry named [[Clubber Lang|James \"Clubber\" Lang]] ([[Mr. T]]), who has risen to the top of the rankings. Rocky begins having some issues with his trainer, Mickey Goldmill, due to his revelation of having faced \"hand-picked\" challengers that were \"good fighters, but not 'killers'\" which Lang seemingly is. Mickey insists that he would step down as Rocky's manager if he chooses to fight Lang, but Rocky convinces him to train him for one last match. However, just like Creed in the first film, Rocky does not put his heart into the training properly, and this reinforces Mickey's belief that Rocky has become too comfortable (or \"civilized\") as champion. Before the match, pandemonium erupts backstage, with Lang shoving Mickey out of the way during a trash-talk exchange of words with Rocky, causing Mickey to suffer from [[cardiac arrest]]. Distraught over Lang's cold indifference, Rocky requests to call the match off, but Mickey and others urge him on, so Rocky goes to fight Lang no matter what. During the match, Rocky's mind is not fully set, and is easily knocked out in the second round, losing his title. After the match, Rocky visits Mickey, who then dies of a [[heart attack]], devastating Rocky. After the funeral, a depressed Rocky wanders the streets of Philadelphia until seeing the statue at the steps. In a fit of rage, Rocky throws his motorcycle helmet at the statue and takes off until he visits Mickey's now-abandoned gym. In the gym, Rocky meets Apollo Creed, who explains to Rocky, that when they fought, he won because that he was competitive. He has the 'fire' Creed no longer has and the former champion convinces Rocky that he needs to get his fire (\"the eye of the tiger\") back. Along with his old trainer, [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]], Creed offers to train Rocky for a rematch against Lang, taking Rocky to [[Los Angeles]]. While training on the beach, Adrian and Rocky furiously debate, while Creed trains Rocky to help get him \"back to basics.\" After a while, Rocky manages to put his doubts behind him and retain his spirit. Fighting with a style very reminiscent of Creed's own boxing technique mixed with his own style, Rocky wins the rematch against Lang by K.O., dodging and absorbing Lang's best blows and still standing, regaining his world heavyweight title. After the match, Rocky and Creed meet again in Mickey's Gym, with Creed taking his \"payment\" for his training services: one last rematch, just the two of them, no spectators.\n\n===''[[Rocky IV]]'' (setting 1982\u20131985)===\nIn 1985, Apollo Creed agrees to have an exhibition match against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] World Amateur Champion and Olympic gold medalist-turned-professional fighter [[Ivan Drago]] ([[Dolph Lundgren]]) in [[Las Vegas]], with Rocky Balboa and Tony \"Duke\" Evers in his corner. Creed, past his prime but in good shape, again not taking his opponent seriously, takes a serious beating by Drago in the first round, despite Rocky's orders to stop the fight. In the second round, Creed continues to be brutally beaten by Drago, falling limp in the ring and dying. Feeling responsible for Creed's death and riddled with guilt by Drago's cold indifference, Rocky decides to take on Drago himself, but to do so, he has to surrender his championship to Drago. Rocky travels to the cold mountains of Russia and undergoes rigorous training, even after being berated by Adrian, who said that Rocky couldn't win against such a vile man like Drago. After much needed training, his match against Drago takes place on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] in [[Moscow]]. With Evers assuming the role as his new trainer, Rocky trains hard using old-school methods within the mountainous terrain of [[Krasnoyarsk Krai|Krasnoyarsk]], [[Siberia]], while Drago trains with state-of-the-art equipment and [[steroid]] enhancement.\n\nDuring the match, Drago gains the upper hand in the early moments, but in the second round, Rocky strikes back against Drago with a [[Punch (strike)#Basic types|haymaker]] to the eye, cutting him. The match goes on in a bloody back-and-forth battle, with the Soviet crowd, who originally roots for Drago, beginning to cheer for Rocky, while Drago's handler becomes increasingly upset over his inability to finish Rocky. In the end, Rocky's superior stamina and determination to win perseveres and defeats the heavily favored Russian in the fifteenth round. After the match, Rocky gives a passionate 'thank you' speech to the crowd while receiving a standing ovation both from the crowd and the politicians in attendance.\n\n===''[[Rocky V]]'' (setting 1985\u20131986)===\nShortly after the bout with Ivan Drago, Rocky realizes that while he is showering, he may have sustained some type of injury during the fight. His hands tremble relentlessly, and he tells Adrian that he is tired and wants to go home, but accidentally addresses her as Mickey. Upon returning to the United States (in a Soviet airplane), his press conference is interrupted by promoter [[George Washington Duke (fictional character)|George Washington Duke]] and Union Cane ([[Michael Williams (boxer)|Michael Williams]]). They challenge him to a title fight called \"Lettin' it Go in Tokyo.\" Rocky hints about retirement and leaves without accepting the challenge. Once returning home, Rocky goes to say goodnight to his son, Robert Jr., but when Rocky goes downstairs, he overhears Adrian and Paulie arguing, which turns out to be a dramatic life-changing situation. Paulie unknowingly had Rocky sign a power of attorney over to Rocky's investment accountant, who had embezzled and squandered all of his money on real estate deals gone sour. In addition, the accountant had failed to pay Rocky's taxes over the past six years and his mansion had been mortgaged by $400,000. Unwilling to go bankrupt, Rocky decides to participate in a few more fights, including the one against Union Cane, but Adrian demands that Rocky should see a doctor first firsthand. Rocky's doctor, Presley Jensen, performs computer-simulated examinations, which reveals that Rocky is diagnosed with a condition called [[Cavum septi pellucidi]], which is [[brain damage]] caused by extremely heavy blows to the head. The effects are seemingly permanent and irreversible. With such a condition, it would make it impossible for Rocky to continue boxing in any state. At Adrian's urging, as well as with the doctor's support, Rocky gravely acknowledges that it is time to retire and he reluctantly does so.\n\nHis only remaining asset is the now-closed Mickey's Gym, which had been willed by Mickey to Robert, making it virtually untouchable by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. After selling their mansion and auctioning some of their belongings, Rocky and the family now return to the old neighborhood, moving back into Adrian and Paulie's old house in South Philadelphia. Rocky reopens Mickey's Gym as a means of income, while Adrian returns to work at the J&M Tropical Fish pet shop, where she was employed during the time she first met Rocky. Rocky asks Adrian, \"Did we ever leave this place?\". One day, Rocky meets a young ruffian boxer from Oklahoma named [[Tommy Gunn (character)|Tommy Gunn]] ([[Tommy Morrison]]) and begins training him. Tommy slowly becomes an excellent fighter, but suffers from constantly being put in Rocky's shadow; he is nicknamed \"Rocky's Robot\" by the media. As Rocky is training Tommy, he becomes so distracted that he ends up neglecting Robert. By Christmas Eve, Duke visits the Balboa residence, but Rocky explains that dealing with Duke would be a dirty business. Late at night, Tommy regrets being Rocky's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, drives off in a huff, and leaves him for good. Adrian attempts to comfort Rocky, but Rocky's frustration boils over. After they reconcile, Rocky meets Robert and they finally pick up the pieces.\n\nRocky is still anxious as he watches the match with Tommy facing off against Union Cane on television with Paulie. As the match starts out small, Rocky begins to emote through the first couple of seconds of the fight as Cane becomes effective in hurting Tommy. As Tommy begins to make his adjustments as Rocky taught him, Rocky then mirrors his punches on a punching bag, which leaves his family concerned. Tommy wins the world heavyweight title from Union Cane by knockout. Visibly proud of Tommy, Rocky is surprised that Tommy credited his success to Duke instead. However, Tommy is booed and ridiculed in the press, since he had never gone up against a \"real contender\" he is not regarded as a real champion or heir to the belt. This motivates Tommy, with prodding from Duke, to publicly challenge Rocky to a fight.\n\nWhile Rocky is at a local bar, Tommy steps in and insults Rocky. Paulie insults Tommy back and is sucker-punched by Tommy. Rocky confronts Tommy and challenges him. Rocky explains to him that his ring is at the alley right outside. As both fighters head to the alley, Duke tries to persuade Tommy to not fight a [[Street fighting|street fighter]], but Tommy squares upon him, saying that he does not own him and wants his respect.\n\nRocky then quickly starts to beat Tommy without giving him a chance, knocking him down. Rocky tells Tommy that, even though he admires him, he actually ruined their relationship. With Rocky's back turned, Tommy sucker punches him and starts attacking some of the bystanders on the side. Tommy gains the upper hand and tackles Rocky through a steel door into the street. The two engage in a street fight, which quickly garners the attention of the media, while also catching Robert and Adrian's attention as well. As the neighborhood gathers round to witness the fight, Tommy's punches begin to slow Rocky in his tracks due to his condition and he is knocked down, disoriented with Paulie at his side. Tommy is then restrained from finishing Rocky off.\n\nGlimpses of Ivan Drago, his loss to Clubber Lang during his first fight with him and Mickey's burial start to cloud his mind until he hears Mickey's voice, telling him that he is the champion and to get up. As Tommy walks away, convinced that he finally got what he wanted, Rocky rises up and calls him out for one more round and Tommy happily obliges. An adamant Duke reminds Tommy that if he loses this, he will terminate their association. In a shocking turn of events, Rocky uses his brawling abilities to punish and humiliate Tommy. With his back towards a gate, Rocky dodges several hooks from Tommy and manages to push him towards the gate, shoving him with brute force and a powerful left hook knocking Tommy down again. Duke threatens to sue Rocky if he touches him and becomes infuriated at Tommy. Tommy gets up and tackles Rocky to the ground and later lifts him up. Just as Robert joins the crowd, Rocky breaks free from Tommy's grip and performs a reversal that sends Tommy spiraling into a pile of trash cans. Both men now exchange punches with Rocky being the aggressor, making Tommy miss his shots. Rocky is then caught by a series of punches by Tommy, just as Adrian joins the crowd, but manages to parry Tommy and begins to walk him down with his devastating shots. Seeing the opportunity, Rocky goes to Tommy's body, then lands perfect headshots and finishes with a right uppercut sending Tommy to the grill of a bus, defeating his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9. As Adrian and Robert tend to him, Rocky tells Adrian that she was right. The neighborhood's cheer is then silenced by Duke as he tries to sarcastically commend Rocky. He confronts Duke, who still continues to threaten him with a lawsuit. Clenching his fist, he uppercuts Duke to the gut which lifts him off the ground, sending him to the hood of his own limousine, telling him \"Sue me for what?\". Rocky, Adrian, Robert, and Paulie walk away in good spirits as the neighborhood continues to cheer him on.\n\nSome time later, Rocky and his son run up the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], where Rocky gives him a valuable possession of Mickey Goldmill's that had been passed on to him by [[Rocky Marciano]]. The two make up for the tensions of the past few years and head into the museum together.\n\n===''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (setting 2006)===\nIn 2006, 20 years after the events of ''Rocky V'', Rocky, now in his early sixties of age, has been going through changing times in his life. He runs a small but rather successful restaurant called 'Adrian's', named after his wife who died of [[ovarian cancer]] four years prior. Rocky is no longer depressed and broke, and is doing far better than he was in years prior. Rocky visits Adrian's graveside regularly and each year, on the anniversary of her death, takes a tour of the old places, where their relationship began and blossomed: the now-closed J&M Tropical Fish pet shop where Adrian worked, the former site of the ice skating rink where they had their first date and Rocky's old apartment, where they fell in love. Rocky's son, Robert Jr., is now working as a struggling mid-level corporate employee and has been farther apart from his family over the years, but reluctantly joins Rocky to commemorate the anniversaries of his mother's death.\n\nAn episode of [[ESPN]]'s program, ''Then and Now'', airs featuring a computer-simulated fight between Rocky (in his prime) and the current champion, Mason \"The Line\" Dixon ([[Antonio Tarver]]). The simulation result sees Rocky winning by knockout in the thirteenth round, which stirs up a discussion about the result if such a fight ever occurred. Inspired by the simulation and feeling he still has some issues to deal with (\"stuff in the basement\"), Rocky decides to return to the ring and applies to renew his boxing license. Though Rocky passes the required physical with flying colors, the licensing committee denies his application, citing his advanced age and their moral duty to protect him from himself. Rocky responds to this with an impassioned speech of his own and the committee change their minds to renew his license.\n\nThe brain damage Rocky is diagnosed within ''Rocky V'' is not addressed in this film, but in interviews, Stallone has said that the storyline explanation would have been that Rocky's brain damage was within the normal range for boxers. When tested for brain damage in ''Rocky V'', Rocky was suffering the effects of a severe concussion as a result of the Drago fight, but he never sought a second or more informed opinion because he intended to retire anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30861 |title=Round One With Sylvester Stallone Q&A!! |website=Aintitcool.com |date= |accessdate=December 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nRocky's intentions were originally just to compete in small, local fights for fun and charity, but with the publicity of Rocky's return right on the heels of the embarrassing computer simulation, Mason Dixon's promoters convince Rocky to challenge the champ in an exhibition match at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Originally against fighting an aged Rocky, Dixon recognizes the opportunity to fight a legend and hopes to end all prognosticating about who would win as well as contentions that he has never had a truly great opponent or memorable match. In the press, commentators dismiss Rocky's chances and the merits of the fight, assuming that it will be one-sided due to Rocky's age, despite their original excitement with Rocky's return to the ring, and their doubts regarding Dixon's ability.\n\nAs news of the bout spreads, Robert begins to feel more pressure from being Rocky's son and makes an effort to discourage Rocky from fighting, blaming his own personal failings on his father's celebrity shadow, but Rocky rebukes him with some profound advice: to succeed in life, \"it ain't about how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward\" and that blaming others won't help him. The day after this debate, father and son meet over Adrian's grave and reconcile, which is when Robert announces that he has resigned from his job to be at ringside. Rocky also reunites with his old trainer, Duke, and both men quickly realize that age and arthritis have sapped Rocky of any speed he once possessed. They decide to focus on one major remaining weapon: power.\n\nWhen the match finally begins, it appears to be as lopsided as everyone predicted, with Dixon's speed allowing him to dominate Rocky at will, knocking him down twice early on. However, the champion soon realizes that Rocky will not back down and that the elderly Rocky \"has bricks in his gloves\". The tide turns when Dixon injures his hand while punching Rocky. This evens the playing field and allows Rocky to mount an offense, knocking Dixon down for the first time in the latter's career. During the subsequent rounds, Dixon's injury numbs up, which enables him to throw much harder punches and pose a threat to Rocky. In the final round, it starts out slow for both combatants. After a brief exchange of punches, Dixon catches Rocky with a strong blow, knocking down Rocky for the third time. As Rocky takes the knee, he looks to Robert in the corner and has flashbacks of his time with Adrian, remembering what she said to him about never giving up. As he slowly gets up, the crowd, along with Marie, starts to chant his name and he rises to Dixon's surprise. As the final thirty seconds unfold, Dixon manages to catch Rocky with quick punches; however, an emotional Rocky retaliates with devastating punches of his own. The two exchange punches, but Rocky gets the final blow before the bell rings. In the end, the two fighters go the distance and show their appreciation for each other. Before the winner is announced, Rocky and his entourage make their way out of the ring in celebration. As Dixon is announced the winner by split decision (Dixon wins in the theatrical release, Balboa wins in an alternate ending <ref>{{cite web|title=Rocky Balboa Alternate Ending - He Wins! (Video)|url=http://www.fightsaga.com/tidbits/item/3449-Rocky-Balboa-Alternate-Ending-He-Wins-%28Video%29|website=FightSaga.com|accessdate=November 27, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127151607/http://www.fightsaga.com/tidbits/item/3449-Rocky-Balboa-Alternate-Ending-He-Wins-%28Video%29|archivedate=November 27, 2015|date=August 17, 2014}}</ref>), Rocky thanks each and every one of his group and, with Robert and Paulie by his side, they turn Rocky around and raise his arms as the audience gives him a heartfelt standing ovation. Dixon is finally recognized as being a warrior for fighting through every round and Rocky proves to the world that he is no joke, mirroring the ending of the first film.\n\nAfter the fight, Rocky visits Adrian's grave and puts flowers on top, telling her, \"Yo, Adrian, we did it\", which is a play on the second film's line, \"Yo, Adrian, I did it!\". Rocky is last seen walking away from the grave and waving goodbye one last time.\n\n===''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' (setting 2015)===\nSince Rocky's very last fight, his brother-in-law, Paulie has died. In addition, his statue has been re-installed at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] at the very bottom of the steps. Three years later, Rocky is visited at Adrian's by [[Donnie Creed|Adonis \"Donnie\" Johnson Creed]] ([[Michael B. Jordan]]) \u2013 Apollo's illegitimate son, who grew up serving time at a juvenile detention center in Los Angeles. After Donnie grew up, he worked as a securities firm at the Smith Boardley Financial Group, but eventually resigned to be a boxer and moved to Philadelphia. Donnie meets Rocky at Adrian's restaurant and requests him to train him, but Rocky is reluctant to come back to the sport of boxing after his brain damage and a one-off comeback. Days after his initial offer, Rocky recommends him to his friend, Pete Sporino ([[Ritchie Coster]]), who currently runs Mighty Mick's Gym. After deep thought, Rocky finally agrees to take Donnie as his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nWanting to train in the old-school style, Donnie moves in with Rocky, staying in Paulie's former room. Donnie notices an old picture of Rocky and his son, Robert (an actual picture of [[Sylvester Stallone]] and a young [[Sage Stallone]]), Rocky reveals that Robert had moved to [[Vancouver]] with his girlfriend, because of the difficulties he faced trying to be independent in Philadelphia, but does check on his father every now and then. Pete, who initially wanted Rocky to be a part of his son, Leo's ([[Gabriel Rosado]]) team, challenges Donnie to fight his son, in which Rocky shows reluctance again, but then both agree. Instead of training at Mighty Mick's Gym, Rocky takes Donnie to train at the Front Street Gym, where he surprises Donnie with a corner team and apparel. Before the fight, Pete pulls Rocky aside to address the rumors of Donnie being Apollo's son, which Rocky confirms, and tells him that he should not speak of it to anyone else. After Donnie's win, the media heavily publicized the story of Apollo's infidelity, which catches the eye of Tommy Holiday ([[Graham McTavish]]), who is looking for the final person to fight his trainee, light-heavyweight champion \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan ([[Tony Bellew]]). While training, Rocky suddenly stalls, vomits, and collapses in the gym. After doing a string of test ordered by the doctors at the emergency room, Rocky is diagnosed with an early case of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], making him confront his own mortality. At first, Rocky is hesitant to the option of chemotherapy, as he remembers the pain Adrian experienced as she underwent treatment for ovarian cancer.\n\nAfter a bitter argument with the former heavyweight champion, Donnie, greatly impacted by his coach's diagnosis, makes a pact with Rocky that they would fight their battles together, as Donnie prepares for his bout with Conlan and as Rocky undergoes treatment. As Donnie moves on in training, the effects of treatment begin to weaken Rocky, and because of this, Donnie acts as a caregiver to Rocky while helping him get up and go to the restroom, and uses the medical facility to his advantage; shadowboxing in the corridors and running up the stairs, passing doctors and nurses. With the match taking place in [[Liverpool]], a calm Rocky teaches Donnie the hysterics that would ensue during the pre-fight press conference when Conlan tries to play mind games, and later helps in Donnie's girlfriend Bianca ([[Tessa Thompson]]) surprising Donnie in his hotel room. During the match, Rocky stands in Donnie's corner along with Bianca. Before the final round, Rocky grows concerned about the injuries that Donnie has sustained and tells him he's stopping the fight. However, Donnie wants to prove that he is \"not a mistake\", which emotionally impacts Rocky. He then tells Donnie that he wishes he had the chance to thank Apollo when Mickey died, but it doesn't match his appreciation of Donnie's tenacity that motivated him in his battle against his illness and tells him that he admires him.  A newly motivated Adonis goes on to fights a competitive final round against Conlan, even knocking him down near the round's conclusion, but ultimately loses the match by split decision in a manner that mirrors Rocky's initial bout against Apollo.\n\nThe film concludes with Donnie taking a frail, but rather improving, Rocky back to the [[Rocky Steps|steps]] of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], which Rocky says is his \"most favorite place.\" Both look toward the [[Philadelphia]] skyline, remaining positive about their futures.\n\n===''[[Creed II]]'' (setting 2018)===\nThree years since his diagnosis, Rocky has recovered from his cancer and coached Donnie until he becomes the new WBC World Light Heavyweight champion. Rocky gives Donnie advice in proposing to Bianca and uses his proposal with Adrian as an example. Rocky struggles with contacting Robert, with whom he has become estranged with.\n\nLater on, Rocky drops by Adrian's and finds Ivan Drago waiting for him there. Drago tells him how his loss to Rocky 33 years earlier shattered his reputation, evicted him from Russia into Ukraine, and led to his divorce from his wife, Ludmilla. Drago threatens him by saying his son, Viktor (Florian Munteanu), has trained all his life and will \"break\" Donnie, issuing a fight challenge to Donnie earlier that morning. Rocky, clearly shaken, politely tells Drago to leave.\n\nWanting to avenge his father and forge his own legacy, Donnie decides to take up Viktor's challenge and goes to Rocky's place for his approval. Rocky refuses to support Donnie, noting that Viktor was raised in hate and has nothing to lose, and that makes him dangerous. Despite Donnie's pleas, Rocky declines to train him out of fear and guilt from Apollo's fateful match years prior.\n\nRocky decides to watch Donnie and Viktor's match, where he watches Viktor pummel Donnie repeatedly. Viktor illegally hits Donnie while he is down, knocking him unconscious; Rocky turns off his television in horror at what he has witnessed. Rocky travels to Los Angeles to visit a hospitalized Donnie, who lashes out at him for abandoning him.\n\nWith Donnie becoming detached from his family, Donnie's stepmother and Apollo's widow Mary Anne ([[Phylicia Rashad]]) contacts Rocky in helping him out of his slump. Donnie and Rocky make amends, and Rocky accompanies Donnie as Bianca gives birth to their daughter, Amara. When Amara is revealed to be deaf, Rocky advises him that they should not pity her condition, and instead treat her fully with their love.\n\nRocky and [[List of Rocky characters#Tony \"Little Duke\" Evers Jr.|Tony \"Little Duke\" Evers]] ([[Wood Harris]]) take Donnie to a decrepit location in the California desert to retrain, describing it as a place where fighters are \"reborn\". Donnie undergoes a rigorous and brutal training regimen with Rocky, focusing on fighting from the inside and training his body to repeatedly absorb the heavy impact he knows he will receive from Viktor in the ring. Rocky accompanies Donnie as they hold their rematch with Viktor in Moscow; Donnie withstands Viktor's blows and wins the match after Drago throws in the towel. Rocky doesn't join Donnie's celebration, saying that it's \"his time,\" and watches in contentment from outside the ring.\n\nRocky later travels to Vancouver where he reunites with Robert and meets his grandson, Logan, for the first time. Rocky is now 72 years old.\n\n===Potential sequel film and prequel television series===\nOn July 23, 2019, in an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Stallone said that a ''Rocky'' sequel and prequel are in development. Producer Irwin Winkler said \"We're very high on it\" and those negotiations are underway for Stallone to write and star in the feature. Stallone said the plot of the movie would be about Rocky befriending a young fighter who is an undocumented immigrant. \"Rocky meets a young, angry person who got stuck in this country when he comes to see his sister. He takes him into his life, and unbelievable adventures begin, and they wind up south of the border. It's very, very timely.\" Stallone said. Stallone also said there are \"ongoing discussions\" about a Rocky prequel television series, which he hopes will land on a streaming service and the series will likely follow a young Rocky Balboa as professional boxing hopeful. Stallone said Winkler is hesitant on making the series saying that \"There was some conflict there, yes. He felt in his mind that ''Rocky'' was primarily a feature film, and he did not see it as being translated for cable, so there was a big bone of contention.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/features/sylvester-stallone-rocky-ownership-stake-1203275639/ |title=Sylvester Stallone Feels Robbed of an Ownership Stake in 'Rocky': 'I Was Furious' |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://popculture.com/movies/2019/07/23/sylvester-stallone-reveals-rocky-sequel-prequel-in-development/ |title=Sylvester Stallone Reveals 'Rocky' Sequel and Prequel Are in Development |work= popculture.com |accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBalboa resides in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and married Adriana \"Adrian\" Pennino in 1976. They were married for 26 years. The two have a son, Robert Balboa Jr., who unlike his father goes by Robert.\n\nAfter Adrian's death in 2002, Rocky and his brother-in-law Paulie live together for a short time, then Paulie moves in with an unnamed girlfriend. Now living completely alone again, Rocky cannot come to terms with present-day living and constantly thinks about the past. With the help of Paulie and reunited long-time acquaintance Marie, Rocky begins to move on with his life and in the process restores his relationship with his only child, Robert. Rocky's relationship with Marie is established as platonic in the film, but a hint of romantic interest is revealed with a kiss on the lips the night before the last fight of his life.\n\n==Character origin==\nThe name, iconography, and fighting style of Rocky Balboa were inspired by the legendary heavyweight champion [[Rocky Marciano]] from [[Brockton, Massachusetts]] and from the 5 times world champion [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n|Roberto 'Manos de Piedra (Hands of Stone)' Dur\u00e1n]], from Panama, where the Balboa is the official currency. Balboa was also inspired by other fighting legends: [[Joe Frazier]], for his Philadelphia origin, training methods and victory against [[Muhammad Ali]] (the inspiration for Apollo Creed), and [[Jake LaMotta]], for his [[Italy|Italian]]-inner city roots, ability to absorb many blows and his rivalry with [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], which heavily resembled Rocky and Apollo's. However, it was the not-so-legendary [[Chuck Wepner]] who inspired the movie and Balboa's underdog personality.\n{{Cquote|Early in my acting career I realized the only way I would ever prove myself was to create my own role in my own script. On my 29th birthday, I had $106 in the bank. My best birthday present was a sudden revelation that I had to write the kind of screenplay that I personally enjoyed seeing. I relished stories of heroism, great love, dignity, and courage, dramas of people rising above their stations, taking life by the throat and not letting go until they succeeded. But I had so many ideas in my head, I couldn't focus on any one. To cheer myself up, I took the last of my entertainment money and went to see the [[Muhammad Ali|Ali]]-Wepner fight on closed circuit TV. Chuck Wepner, a battling, bruising club fighter who had never made the big time, was having his shot. It wasn't at all regarded as a serious battle. But as the fight progressed, this miracle unfolded. He hung in there. People went absolutely crazy. Wepner was knocked out in the 15th and final round, almost lasting the distance. We had witnessed an incredible triumph of the human spirit and we loved it.\n\nThat night, Rocky Balboa was born. People looked on him as the all-American tragedy, a man without much mentality and few social graces. But he has deep emotion and spirituality and good patriotism. And he has a good nature, although nature has not been particularly good to him. I have always seen him as a 20th Century gladiator in a pair of sneakers. Like so many of us, he is out of sync with the times. To all this, I injected doses of my own personal life, of my frustration at not getting anywhere.|30px|30px|Sylvester Stallone<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalrocky.com/films/rocky/production.shtml |title=Rocky: Behind the Scenes Rocky (1976) &#124; Making Of Rocky |website=Totalrocky.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-12-01}}</ref>}}\n\n==Boxing style==\nRocky Balboa fights as a [[Southpaw (boxing)|southpaw]] (left-handed). In the second film, against Apollo Creed, he comes out [[Orthodox (boxing)|orthodox]] and Mickey intends for him to switch back to southpaw late in the last round, but Balboa refuses saying \"no tricks, I ain't switching\".  Mickey tells him that Apollo is ready for him (if he continues using his right) and so towards the end of the round, he does indeed lead with his left. The real reason for this is Sylvester Stallone tore his pectoral muscles in training,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} but the idea was probably taken from the great left-handed boxer [[\"Marvelous\" Marvin Hagler]] who would sometimes come out orthodox to confuse opponents.\n\nRocky was an all-or-nothing brawler coming into his first bout with Creed; however, under the training of Mickey, he began to develop his boxing skills which he eventually mastered. During his reign as world champion, he became a class hybrid fighter, possessing the qualities of an inside fighter, brawler, and swarmer. With the exception of his rematch against [[Clubber Lang]] (where he fights as an outside fighter), he often advances quickly upon his opponents, driving them into the ropes in order to attack the body. Balboa's best attribute is without question his near-superhuman ability to [[Chin (combat sports)|absorb a multitude of the hardest hits without falling]] \u2014 an attribute he often employs on purpose to wear down his opponents, sacrificing defensive strategy to land his own punches. Because of this rare talent, Balboa can afford to keep his hands in position to strike rather than up high to block. Because he takes more punches than he throws, it is easy to overlook his incredible punching power. Rocky also has an uncanny ability to sense weakness in his opponents, often capitalizing on every shift in momentum possible. He is acknowledged as having the most devastating body attack in the sport, with his body blows causing internal bleeding in Creed and breaking Drago's ribs. After going two rounds with Balboa, [[Ivan Drago]] told his trainer (in Russian), \"He's not human, he's like a piece of iron.\" [[Rocky Balboa (film)|Mason Dixon]] once remarked about Balboa: \"that guy's got bricks in his gloves.\" These qualities, in concert, helped land him a high percentage of KO victories over the course of his career.\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:Philly042107-014-RockyStatue.jpg|thumb|Rocky Statue, situated just northeast of the [[Rocky Steps]].]]\n\nRocky Balboa was named the 7th greatest movie hero by the [[American Film Institute]] on their ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains]]'' list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains |publisher=afi.com |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref> Additionally, he was ranked #34 on [[Empire Magazine]]'s compilation of ''The 100 Greatest Movie Characters''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=34 |title=''Empire's'' The 100 Greatest Movie Characters |publisher=Empire Magazine |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' magazine ranked Rocky Balboa #64 on their list of ''The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/100characters2.html |title=''Premiere's'' The 100 Greatest Movie Characters |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Rocky character is immortalised with a bronze [[statue]] erected near the Rocky Steps in Philadelphia recalling the famous scene from the original ''Rocky'' movie.\n\nIn 2011, Sylvester Stallone was inducted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] for his work on the Rocky Balboa character, having \"entertained and inspired boxing fans from around the world\".

The character was created by [[Sylvester Stallone]], who also portrayed him in all eight ''Rocky'' films. He is depicted as an [[everyman]] who started out by going the distance and overcoming obstacles that had occurred in his life and career as a professional [[boxer]]. While the story of his first film is loosely inspired by that of [[Chuck Wepner]], a one-time boxer who fought [[Muhammad Ali]] and lost on a TKO in the 15th round, the inspiration for the name, iconography and fighting style came from boxing legend [[Rocky Marciano|Rocco Francis \"Rocky Marciano\" Marchegiano]], though his surname coincidentally also resembles that of Middleweight Boxing Champion [[Rocky Graziano|Thomas Rocco \"Rocky Graziano\" Barbella]].\n\nThe character is widely considered to be Stallone's most iconic role and is often considered the role that started his film career. He received critical acclaim for his performance in the first movie, earning [[Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations. When Stallone reprised his role once again in 2015 for ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'', his performance received wide acclaim and he received his first [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor]], along with his third Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and several other accolades.\n\n==Biography==\nRobert \"Rocky\" Balboa was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], on July 6, 1945. He was the only child in a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Italian-American]] family. However, the surname Balboa (roughly meaning \"beautiful valley\") originates from a [[Balboa, Le\u00f3n|Galician-speaking town in northwestern Spain]]. When Rocky is spoken to by his priest, Father Carmine, it is apparent that he understands Italian very well, including a scene in which he translates for Tommy Gunn. It is undetermined how well he actually speaks the language, as his responses are always in English.\n\nDuring the scene in which Rocky takes Adrianna \"Adrian\" Pennino skating on Thanksgiving, he tells her, \"Yeah \u2013 My old man, who was never the sharpest, told me I weren't born with much brain, so I better use my body.\" This encouraged him to take up boxing. He trained very hard so he could grow up to be like his idol [[Rocky Marciano]]. Unable to live on the low pay of club fights, and being unable to find work anywhere else, Rocky got a job as a collector for Tony Gazzo, the local loan shark, just to make ends meet. By late 1975, Rocky had fought in 64 fights, winning 44 (38 KO'S) and losing 20. Rocky was proud that he never had his nose broken in any of his ametuer fighting career. His nickname is \"The Italian Stallion\", spawning from his Italian-American heritage.\n\n===''[[Rocky]]'' (setting 1975\u20131976)===\nThe film begins on November 25, 1975, in the slums of the [[Kensington, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Kensington]] section of [[Philadelphia]]. Rocky Balboa is fighting Spider Rico in a local boxing ring called the Cambria Fight Club (nicknamed \"The Bucket of Blood\") inside a chapel. In the second round, Rico hits Balboa with a headbutt, leaving a gash on his forehead. Rocky then delivers a vicious barrage of punches, knocking Rico out. The next day, Rocky stops by the J&M Tropical Fish pet shop, where he meets Adrian Pennino. Adrian is very shy and scared of Rocky's tough appearance. Afterward, Rocky goes to collect a loan for his loan shark boss, Tony Gazzo. Even though the client, Bob, does not have all the money, Rocky does not break his thumbs, even though Gazzo had ordered him to do so. Later, Rocky stops by the local boxing gym and finds out that his locker has been replaced by another local contender. Unknown to him, the gym's owner and grizzled former boxer, [[Mickey Goldmill]], does not dislike him, but considers Rocky's potential to be better than his effort. When Rocky leaves for home that night, he sees a young girl named Marie hanging around a bad crowd and walks her home. On the way, Rocky lectures her about staying away from the wrong people. However, once they get to her house, she tells Rocky \"Screw you, creep'o\". Rocky walks home, frustrated how nothing is going right in his life.\n\nRocky gets his dream come true when the undisputed World Heavyweight Champion, [[Apollo Creed]], decides that he wants to give an unknown fighter a chance to fight for the title after his intended challenger, Mac Lee Green, broke his hand while training. Creed was told that no other contender was available for a fight on New Years Day. Creed chooses Rocky because he likes Balboa's nickname, 'The Italian Stallion'.\n\nAfter getting picked by Creed, Rocky reunites with his estranged trainer, who convinces Rocky that he can help prepare him for the match. Mickey reveals that his career never got anywhere because he did not have a manager and he does not want the same thing to happen to Rocky. At the same time, Rocky begins dating Adrian. Rocky helps Adrian to become more self-confident and stand up for herself. Rocky confides in Adrian before the fight that, although he figures that he may not win, he wants to at least \"[[The distance (boxing)|go the distance]].\"\n\nOn January 1, 1976, at the [[Philadelphia Spectrum]], Rocky has his match with Creed, who did not take the fight seriously during training. In the first round, Rocky knocks Creed down, the first time he had ever been knocked down in his career and Creed breaks Rocky's nose, also for the first time in his career. Creed soon realizes that, although Rocky does not have his level of skills, he could deliver crippling, sledge-hammer like punches and is determined to keep fighting. The match becomes a long and grueling battle for both competitors. Up into the 14th round, Rocky is nearly knocked down but manages to get back up and delivers some hard body shots, breaking Creed's ribs just before the bell rings. The 15th round comes to naught and Rocky manages to pummel Creed until the bell rings once more. It is the first time an opponent had lasted the full 15 rounds against him and as a result, it ends up with a [[split decision]], Creed wins the fight and holds on to his title. Both combatants, battered beyond belief, agree that there would be no rematch. Rocky clearly doesn't mind about the outcome, as he only wanted to go the distance with Creed. After the match, Adrian climbs into the ring and embraces Rocky saying, \"I love you!\"\n\n===''[[Rocky II]]'' (setting 1976)===\nAfter the match, Creed changes his mind and demands a rematch under the stress of being humiliated by the press for failing to beat Rocky convincingly, as well as his own knowledge that he didn't give his best in the match. Creed demands a rematch with Rocky, stating that he would fight him 'anywhere, anyplace, anytime' to prove to the world that Rocky's feat was merely a fluke. Rocky initially declines and retires from boxing, having surgery for [[retinal detachment]], a condition that could lead to permanent blindness. He marries Adrian, who convinces him to live outside boxing. However, Rocky, a grade-school drop-out, soon realizes that he has no white-collar skills beyond the eighth grade and, in fact, has dyslexia. The money he made in his match with Creed is easily and quickly frittered away, so Adrian re-claims her part-time job at the J&M Tropical Fish pet shop. At first, Rocky seems to be unaffected by Creed's smear campaign, but his inexperience with money causes him to run into financial troubles. Rocky struggles to find employment with decent pay, when he is fired from a commercial studio, turned down for an office job and even laid off at the Shamrock meat packing facility. Despite Adrian's objections, and after Creed insults Rocky on national television and the newspaper, he agrees to the rematch. Without Adrian's support, however, Rocky becomes greatly discouraged and cannot concentrate on his training whatsoever, leaving Mick frustrated and worried. The now-pregnant Adrian goes into preterm labor on the job due to stress and slips into a coma after giving birth to her first child, Robert Jr. When Adrian is out of the coma, she promises her full support to Rocky. Together, Mickey and Rocky train hard, focusing on Rocky's speed and improving his right-handed punching (Rocky being a [[southpaw stance|southpaw]]). At the same time, Creed is also focused on his training, taking this match much more seriously than the previous time. The rematch is set for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. The match goes on for the full 15 rounds again, with both Rocky and Creed falling to the canvas after Rocky lands a succession of left hands. As referee Lou Fillipo exercises his 10-count to the limit, both Creed and Rocky struggle to get back up and Creed falls back down in exhaustion. Rocky is able to get back up from sheer determination, beating the 10-count and winning the rematch by knockout, thus becoming heavyweight champion of the world.\n\n===''[[Rocky III]]'' (setting 1976\u20131979)===\nOver the next three years, Rocky has successfully defended his title in ten consecutive matches against various contenders, amassing a wealthy fortune and worldwide fame in the process. In addition, Rocky also has an exhibition match against the World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion, \"Thunderlips\" ([[Hulk Hogan]]), with the match ending in a draw. However, in 1981, Rocky is challenged by a power-hungry named [[Clubber Lang|James \"Clubber\" Lang]] ([[Mr. T]]), who has risen to the top of the rankings. Rocky begins having some issues with his trainer, Mickey Goldmill, due to his revelation of having faced \"hand-picked\" challengers that were \"good fighters, but not 'killers'\" which Lang seemingly is. Mickey insists that he would step down as Rocky's manager if he chooses to fight Lang, but Rocky convinces him to train him for one last match. However, just like Creed in the first film, Rocky does not put his heart into the training properly, and this reinforces Mickey's belief that Rocky has become too comfortable (or \"civilized\") as champion. Before the match, pandemonium erupts backstage, with Lang shoving Mickey out of the way during a trash-talk exchange of words with Rocky, causing Mickey to suffer from [[cardiac arrest]]. Distraught over Lang's cold indifference, Rocky requests to call the match off, but Mickey and others urge him on, so Rocky goes to fight Lang no matter what. During the match, Rocky's mind is not fully set, and is easily knocked out in the second round, losing his title. After the match, Rocky visits Mickey, who then dies of a [[heart attack]], devastating Rocky. After the funeral, a depressed Rocky wanders the streets of Philadelphia until seeing the statue at the steps. In a fit of rage, Rocky throws his motorcycle helmet at the statue and takes off until he visits Mickey's now-abandoned gym. In the gym, Rocky meets Apollo Creed, who explains to Rocky, that when they fought, he won because that he was competitive. He has the 'fire' Creed no longer has and the former champion convinces Rocky that he needs to get his fire (\"the eye of the tiger\") back. Along with his old trainer, [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]], Creed offers to train Rocky for a rematch against Lang, taking Rocky to [[Los Angeles]]. While training on the beach, Adrian and Rocky furiously debate, while Creed trains Rocky to help get him \"back to basics.\" After a while, Rocky manages to put his doubts behind him and retain his spirit. Fighting with a style very reminiscent of Creed's own boxing technique mixed with his own style, Rocky wins the rematch against Lang by K.O., dodging and absorbing Lang's best blows and still standing, regaining his world heavyweight title. After the match, Rocky and Creed meet again in Mickey's Gym, with Creed taking his \"payment\" for his training services: one last rematch, just the two of them, no spectators.\n\n===''[[Rocky IV]]'' (setting 1982\u20131985)===\nIn 1985, Apollo Creed agrees to have an exhibition match against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] World Amateur Champion and Olympic gold medalist-turned-professional fighter [[Ivan Drago]] ([[Dolph Lundgren]]) in [[Las Vegas]], with Rocky Balboa and Tony \"Duke\" Evers in his corner. Creed, past his prime but in good shape, again not taking his opponent seriously, takes a serious beating by Drago in the first round, despite Rocky's orders to stop the fight. In the second round, Creed continues to be brutally beaten by Drago, falling limp in the ring and dying. Feeling responsible for Creed's death and riddled with guilt by Drago's cold indifference, Rocky decides to take on Drago himself, but to do so, he has to surrender his championship to Drago. Rocky travels to the cold mountains of Russia and undergoes rigorous training, even after being berated by Adrian, who said that Rocky couldn't win against such a vile man like Drago. After much needed training, his match against Drago takes place on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] in [[Moscow]]. With Evers assuming the role as his new trainer, Rocky trains hard using old-school methods within the mountainous terrain of [[Krasnoyarsk Krai|Krasnoyarsk]], [[Siberia]], while Drago trains with state-of-the-art equipment and [[steroid]] enhancement.\n\nDuring the match, Drago gains the upper hand in the early moments, but in the second round, Rocky strikes back against Drago with a [[Punch (strike)#Basic types|haymaker]] to the eye, cutting him. The match goes on in a bloody back-and-forth battle, with the Soviet crowd, who originally roots for Drago, beginning to cheer for Rocky, while Drago's handler becomes increasingly upset over his inability to finish Rocky. In the end, Rocky's superior stamina and determination to win perseveres and defeats the heavily favored Russian in the fifteenth round. After the match, Rocky gives a passionate 'thank you' speech to the crowd while receiving a standing ovation both from the crowd and the politicians in attendance.\n\n===''[[Rocky V]]'' (setting 1985\u20131986)===\nShortly after the bout with Ivan Drago, Rocky realizes that while he is showering, he may have sustained some type of injury during the fight. His hands tremble relentlessly, and he tells Adrian that he is tired and wants to go home, but accidentally addresses her as Mickey. Upon returning to the United States (in a Soviet airplane), his press conference is interrupted by promoter [[George Washington Duke (fictional character)|George Washington Duke]] and Union Cane ([[Michael Williams (boxer)|Michael Williams]]). They challenge him to a title fight called \"Lettin' it Go in Tokyo.\" Rocky hints about retirement and leaves without accepting the challenge. Once returning home, Rocky goes to say goodnight to his son, Robert Jr., but when Rocky goes downstairs, he overhears Adrian and Paulie arguing, which turns out to be a dramatic life-changing situation. Paulie unknowingly had Rocky sign a power of attorney over to Rocky's investment accountant, who had embezzled and squandered all of his money on real estate deals gone sour. In addition, the accountant had failed to pay Rocky's taxes over the past six years and his mansion had been mortgaged by $400,000. Unwilling to go bankrupt, Rocky decides to participate in a few more fights, including the one against Union Cane, but Adrian demands that Rocky should see a doctor first firsthand. Rocky's doctor, Presley Jensen, performs computer-simulated examinations, which reveals that Rocky is diagnosed with a condition called [[Cavum septi pellucidi]], which is [[brain damage]] caused by extremely heavy blows to the head. The effects are seemingly permanent and irreversible. With such a condition, it would make it impossible for Rocky to continue boxing in any state. At Adrian's urging, as well as with the doctor's support, Rocky gravely acknowledges that it is time to retire and he reluctantly does so.\n\nHis only remaining asset is the now-closed Mickey's Gym, which had been willed by Mickey to Robert, making it virtually untouchable by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. After selling their mansion and auctioning some of their belongings, Rocky and the family now return to the old neighborhood, moving back into Adrian and Paulie's old house in South Philadelphia. Rocky reopens Mickey's Gym as a means of income, while Adrian returns to work at the J&M Tropical Fish pet shop, where she was employed during the time she first met Rocky. Rocky asks Adrian, \"Did we ever leave this place?\". One day, Rocky meets a young ruffian boxer from Oklahoma named [[Tommy Gunn (character)|Tommy Gunn]] ([[Tommy Morrison]]) and begins training him. Tommy slowly becomes an excellent fighter, but suffers from constantly being put in Rocky's shadow; he is nicknamed \"Rocky's Robot\" by the media. As Rocky is training Tommy, he becomes so distracted that he ends up neglecting Robert. By Christmas Eve, Duke visits the Balboa residence, but Rocky explains that dealing with Duke would be a dirty business. Late at night, Tommy regrets being Rocky's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, drives off in a huff, and leaves him for good. Adrian attempts to comfort Rocky, but Rocky's frustration boils over. After they reconcile, Rocky meets Robert and they finally pick up the pieces.\n\nRocky is still anxious as he watches the match with Tommy facing off against Union Cane on television with Paulie. As the match starts out small, Rocky begins to emote through the first couple of seconds of the fight as Cane becomes effective in hurting Tommy. As Tommy begins to make his adjustments as Rocky taught him, Rocky then mirrors his punches on a punching bag, which leaves his family concerned. Tommy wins the world heavyweight title from Union Cane by knockout. Visibly proud of Tommy, Rocky is surprised that Tommy credited his success to Duke instead. However, Tommy is booed and ridiculed in the press, since he had never gone up against a \"real contender\" he is not regarded as a real champion or heir to the belt. This motivates Tommy, with prodding from Duke, to publicly challenge Rocky to a fight.\n\nWhile Rocky is at a local bar, Tommy steps in and insults Rocky. Paulie insults Tommy back and is sucker-punched by Tommy. Rocky confronts Tommy and challenges him. Rocky explains to him that his ring is at the alley right outside. As both fighters head to the alley, Duke tries to persuade Tommy to not fight a [[Street fighting|street fighter]], but Tommy squares upon him, saying that he does not own him and wants his respect.\n\nRocky then quickly starts to beat Tommy without giving him a chance, knocking him down. Rocky tells Tommy that, even though he admires him, he actually ruined their relationship. With Rocky's back turned, Tommy sucker punches him and starts attacking some of the bystanders on the side. Tommy gains the upper hand and tackles Rocky through a steel door into the street. The two engage in a street fight, which quickly garners the attention of the media, while also catching Robert and Adrian's attention as well. As the neighborhood gathers round to witness the fight, Tommy's punches begin to slow Rocky in his tracks due to his condition and he is knocked down, disoriented with Paulie at his side. Tommy is then restrained from finishing Rocky off.\n\nGlimpses of Ivan Drago, his loss to Clubber Lang during his first fight with him and Mickey's burial start to cloud his mind until he hears Mickey's voice, telling him that he is the champion and to get up. As Tommy walks away, convinced that he finally got what he wanted, Rocky rises up and calls him out for one more round and Tommy happily obliges. An adamant Duke reminds Tommy that if he loses this, he will terminate their association. In a shocking turn of events, Rocky uses his brawling abilities to punish and humiliate Tommy. With his back towards a gate, Rocky dodges several hooks from Tommy and manages to push him towards the gate, shoving him with brute force and a powerful left hook knocking Tommy down again. Duke threatens to sue Rocky if he touches him and becomes infuriated at Tommy. Tommy gets up and tackles Rocky to the ground and later lifts him up. Just as Robert joins the crowd, Rocky breaks free from Tommy's grip and performs a reversal that sends Tommy spiraling into a pile of trash cans. Both men now exchange punches with Rocky being the aggressor, making Tommy miss his shots. Rocky is then caught by a series of punches by Tommy, just as Adrian joins the crowd, but manages to parry Tommy and begins to walk him down with his devastating shots. Seeing the opportunity, Rocky goes to Tommy's body, then lands perfect headshots and finishes with a right uppercut sending Tommy to the grill of a bus, defeating his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9. As Adrian and Robert tend to him, Rocky tells Adrian that she was right. The neighborhood's cheer is then silenced by Duke as he tries to sarcastically commend Rocky. He confronts Duke, who still continues to threaten him with a lawsuit. Clenching his fist, he uppercuts Duke to the gut which lifts him off the ground, sending him to the hood of his own limousine, telling him \"Sue me for what?\". Rocky, Adrian, Robert, and Paulie walk away in good spirits as the neighborhood continues to cheer him on.\n\nSome time later, Rocky and his son run up the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], where Rocky gives him a valuable possession of Mickey Goldmill's that had been passed on to him by [[Rocky Marciano]]. The two make up for the tensions of the past few years and head into the museum together.\n\n===''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (setting 2006)===\nIn 2006, 20 years after the events of ''Rocky V'', Rocky, now in his early sixties of age, has been going through changing times in his life. He runs a small but rather successful restaurant called 'Adrian's', named after his wife who died of [[ovarian cancer]] four years prior. Rocky is no longer depressed and broke, and is doing far better than he was in years prior. Rocky visits Adrian's graveside regularly and each year, on the anniversary of her death, takes a tour of the old places, where their relationship began and blossomed: the now-closed J&M Tropical Fish pet shop where Adrian worked, the former site of the ice skating rink where they had their first date and Rocky's old apartment, where they fell in love. Rocky's son, Robert Jr., is now working as a struggling mid-level corporate employee and has been farther apart from his family over the years, but reluctantly joins Rocky to commemorate the anniversaries of his mother's death.\n\nAn episode of [[ESPN]]'s program, ''Then and Now'', airs featuring a computer-simulated fight between Rocky (in his prime) and the current champion, Mason \"The Line\" Dixon ([[Antonio Tarver]]). The simulation result sees Rocky winning by knockout in the thirteenth round, which stirs up a discussion about the result if such a fight ever occurred. Inspired by the simulation and feeling he still has some issues to deal with (\"stuff in the basement\"), Rocky decides to return to the ring and applies to renew his boxing license. Though Rocky passes the required physical with flying colors, the licensing committee denies his application, citing his advanced age and their moral duty to protect him from himself. Rocky responds to this with an impassioned speech of his own and the committee change their minds to renew his license.\n\nThe brain damage Rocky is diagnosed within ''Rocky V'' is not addressed in this film, but in interviews, Stallone has said that the storyline explanation would have been that Rocky's brain damage was within the normal range for boxers. When tested for brain damage in ''Rocky V'', Rocky was suffering the effects of a severe concussion as a result of the Drago fight, but he never sought a second or more informed opinion because he intended to retire anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30861 |title=Round One With Sylvester Stallone Q&A!! |website=Aintitcool.com |date= |accessdate=December 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nRocky's intentions were originally just to compete in small, local fights for fun and charity, but with the publicity of Rocky's return right on the heels of the embarrassing computer simulation, Mason Dixon's promoters convince Rocky to challenge the champ in an exhibition match at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Originally against fighting an aged Rocky, Dixon recognizes the opportunity to fight a legend and hopes to end all prognosticating about who would win as well as contentions that he has never had a truly great opponent or memorable match. In the press, commentators dismiss Rocky's chances and the merits of the fight, assuming that it will be one-sided due to Rocky's age, despite their original excitement with Rocky's return to the ring, and their doubts regarding Dixon's ability.\n\nAs news of the bout spreads, Robert begins to feel more pressure from being Rocky's son and makes an effort to discourage Rocky from fighting, blaming his own personal failings on his father's celebrity shadow, but Rocky rebukes him with some profound advice: to succeed in life, \"it ain't about how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward\" and that blaming others won't help him. The day after this debate, father and son meet over Adrian's grave and reconcile, which is when Robert announces that he has resigned from his job to be at ringside. Rocky also reunites with his old trainer, Duke, and both men quickly realize that age and arthritis have sapped Rocky of any speed he once possessed. They decide to focus on one major remaining weapon: power.\n\nWhen the match finally begins, it appears to be as lopsided as everyone predicted, with Dixon's speed allowing him to dominate Rocky at will, knocking him down twice early on. However, the champion soon realizes that Rocky will not back down and that the elderly Rocky \"has bricks in his gloves\". The tide turns when Dixon injures his hand while punching Rocky. This evens the playing field and allows Rocky to mount an offense, knocking Dixon down for the first time in the latter's career. During the subsequent rounds, Dixon's injury numbs up, which enables him to throw much harder punches and pose a threat to Rocky. In the final round, it starts out slow for both combatants. After a brief exchange of punches, Dixon catches Rocky with a strong blow, knocking down Rocky for the third time. As Rocky takes the knee, he looks to Robert in the corner and has flashbacks of his time with Adrian, remembering what she said to him about never giving up. As he slowly gets up, the crowd, along with Marie, starts to chant his name and he rises to Dixon's surprise. As the final thirty seconds unfold, Dixon manages to catch Rocky with quick punches; however, an emotional Rocky retaliates with devastating punches of his own. The two exchange punches, but Rocky gets the final blow before the bell rings. In the end, the two fighters go the distance and show their appreciation for each other. Before the winner is announced, Rocky and his entourage make their way out of the ring in celebration. As Dixon is announced the winner by split decision (Dixon wins in the theatrical release, Balboa wins in an alternate ending <ref>{{cite web|title=Rocky Balboa Alternate Ending - He Wins! (Video)|url=http://www.fightsaga.com/tidbits/item/3449-Rocky-Balboa-Alternate-Ending-He-Wins-%28Video%29|website=FightSaga.com|accessdate=November 27, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127151607/http://www.fightsaga.com/tidbits/item/3449-Rocky-Balboa-Alternate-Ending-He-Wins-%28Video%29|archivedate=November 27, 2015|date=August 17, 2014}}</ref>), Rocky thanks each and every one of his group and, with Robert and Paulie by his side, they turn Rocky around and raise his arms as the audience gives him a heartfelt standing ovation. Dixon is finally recognized as being a warrior for fighting through every round and Rocky proves to the world that he is no joke, mirroring the ending of the first film.\n\nAfter the fight, Rocky visits Adrian's grave and puts flowers on top, telling her, \"Yo, Adrian, we did it\", which is a play on the second film's line, \"Yo, Adrian, I did it!\". Rocky is last seen walking away from the grave and waving goodbye one last time.\n\n===''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' (setting 2015)===\nSince Rocky's very last fight, his brother-in-law, Paulie has died. In addition, his statue has been re-installed at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] at the very bottom of the steps. Three years later, Rocky is visited at Adrian's by [[Donnie Creed|Adonis \"Donnie\" Johnson Creed]] ([[Michael B. Jordan]]) \u2013 Apollo's illegitimate son, who grew up serving time at a juvenile detention center in Los Angeles. After Donnie grew up, he worked as a securities firm at the Smith Boardley Financial Group, but eventually resigned to be a boxer and moved to Philadelphia. Donnie meets Rocky at Adrian's restaurant and requests him to train him, but Rocky is reluctant to come back to the sport of boxing after his brain damage and a one-off comeback. Days after his initial offer, Rocky recommends him to his friend, Pete Sporino ([[Ritchie Coster]]), who currently runs Mighty Mick's Gym. After deep thought, Rocky finally agrees to take Donnie as his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nWanting to train in the old-school style, Donnie moves in with Rocky, staying in Paulie's former room. Donnie notices an old picture of Rocky and his son, Robert (an actual picture of [[Sylvester Stallone]] and a young [[Sage Stallone]]), Rocky reveals that Robert had moved to [[Vancouver]] with his girlfriend, because of the difficulties he faced trying to be independent in Philadelphia, but does check on his father every now and then. Pete, who initially wanted Rocky to be a part of his son, Leo's ([[Gabriel Rosado]]) team, challenges Donnie to fight his son, in which Rocky shows reluctance again, but then both agree. Instead of training at Mighty Mick's Gym, Rocky takes Donnie to train at the Front Street Gym, where he surprises Donnie with a corner team and apparel. Before the fight, Pete pulls Rocky aside to address the rumors of Donnie being Apollo's son, which Rocky confirms, and tells him that he should not speak of it to anyone else. After Donnie's win, the media heavily publicized the story of Apollo's infidelity, which catches the eye of Tommy Holiday ([[Graham McTavish]]), who is looking for the final person to fight his trainee, light-heavyweight champion \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan ([[Tony Bellew]]). While training, Rocky suddenly stalls, vomits, and collapses in the gym. After doing a string of test ordered by the doctors at the emergency room, Rocky is diagnosed with an early case of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], making him confront his own mortality. At first, Rocky is hesitant to the option of chemotherapy, as he remembers the pain Adrian experienced as she underwent treatment for ovarian cancer.\n\nAfter a bitter argument with the former heavyweight champion, Donnie, greatly impacted by his coach's diagnosis, makes a pact with Rocky that they would fight their battles together, as Donnie prepares for his bout with Conlan and as Rocky undergoes treatment. As Donnie moves on in training, the effects of treatment begin to weaken Rocky, and because of this, Donnie acts as a caregiver to Rocky while helping him get up and go to the restroom, and uses the medical facility to his advantage; shadowboxing in the corridors and running up the stairs, passing doctors and nurses. With the match taking place in [[Liverpool]], a calm Rocky teaches Donnie the hysterics that would ensue during the pre-fight press conference when Conlan tries to play mind games, and later helps in Donnie's girlfriend Bianca ([[Tessa Thompson]]) surprising Donnie in his hotel room. During the match, Rocky stands in Donnie's corner along with Bianca. Before the final round, Rocky grows concerned about the injuries that Donnie has sustained and tells him he's stopping the fight. However, Donnie wants to prove that he is \"not a mistake\", which emotionally impacts Rocky. He then tells Donnie that he wishes he had the chance to thank Apollo when Mickey died, but it doesn't match his appreciation of Donnie's tenacity that motivated him in his battle against his illness and tells him that he admires him.  A newly motivated Adonis goes on to fights a competitive final round against Conlan, even knocking him down near the round's conclusion, but ultimately loses the match by split decision in a manner that mirrors Rocky's initial bout against Apollo.\n\nThe film concludes with Donnie taking a frail, but rather improving, Rocky back to the [[Rocky Steps|steps]] of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], which Rocky says is his \"most favorite place.\" Both look toward the [[Philadelphia]] skyline, remaining positive about their futures.\n\n===''[[Creed II]]'' (setting 2018)===\nThree years since his diagnosis, Rocky has recovered from his cancer and coached Donnie until he becomes the new WBC World Light Heavyweight champion. Rocky gives Donnie advice in proposing to Bianca and uses his proposal with Adrian as an example. Rocky struggles with contacting Robert, with whom he has become estranged with.\n\nLater on, Rocky drops by Adrian's and finds Ivan Drago waiting for him there. Drago tells him how his loss to Rocky 33 years earlier shattered his reputation, evicted him from Russia into Ukraine, and led to his divorce from his wife, Ludmilla. Drago threatens him by saying his son, Viktor (Florian Munteanu), has trained all his life and will \"break\" Donnie, issuing a fight challenge to Donnie earlier that morning. Rocky, clearly shaken, politely tells Drago to leave.\n\nWanting to avenge his father and forge his own legacy, Donnie decides to take up Viktor's challenge and goes to Rocky's place for his approval. Rocky refuses to support Donnie, noting that Viktor was raised in hate and has nothing to lose, and that makes him dangerous. Despite Donnie's pleas, Rocky declines to train him out of fear and guilt from Apollo's fateful match years prior.\n\nRocky decides to watch Donnie and Viktor's match, where he watches Viktor pummel Donnie repeatedly. Viktor illegally hits Donnie while he is down, knocking him unconscious; Rocky turns off his television in horror at what he has witnessed. Rocky travels to Los Angeles to visit a hospitalized Donnie, who lashes out at him for abandoning him.\n\nWith Donnie becoming detached from his family, Donnie's stepmother and Apollo's widow Mary Anne ([[Phylicia Rashad]]) contacts Rocky in helping him out of his slump. Donnie and Rocky make amends, and Rocky accompanies Donnie as Bianca gives birth to their daughter, Amara. When Amara is revealed to be deaf, Rocky advises him that they should not pity her condition, and instead treat her fully with their love.\n\nRocky and [[List of Rocky characters#Tony \"Little Duke\" Evers Jr.|Tony \"Little Duke\" Evers]] ([[Wood Harris]]) take Donnie to a decrepit location in the California desert to retrain, describing it as a place where fighters are \"reborn\". Donnie undergoes a rigorous and brutal training regimen with Rocky, focusing on fighting from the inside and training his body to repeatedly absorb the heavy impact he knows he will receive from Viktor in the ring. Rocky accompanies Donnie as they hold their rematch with Viktor in Moscow; Donnie withstands Viktor's blows and wins the match after Drago throws in the towel. Rocky doesn't join Donnie's celebration, saying that it's \"his time,\" and watches in contentment from outside the ring.\n\nRocky later travels to Vancouver where he reunites with Robert and meets his grandson, Logan, for the first time. Rocky is now 72 years old.\n\n===Potential sequel film and prequel television series===\nOn July 23, 2019, in an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Stallone said that a ''Rocky'' sequel and prequel are in development. Producer Irwin Winkler said \"We're very high on it\" and those negotiations are underway for Stallone to write and star in the feature. Stallone said the plot of the movie would be about Rocky befriending a young fighter who is an undocumented immigrant. \"Rocky meets a young, angry person who got stuck in this country when he comes to see his sister. He takes him into his life, and unbelievable adventures begin, and they wind up south of the border. It's very, very timely.\" Stallone said. Stallone also said there are \"ongoing discussions\" about a Rocky prequel television series, which he hopes will land on a streaming service and the series will likely follow a young Rocky Balboa as professional boxing hopeful. Stallone said Winkler is hesitant on making the series saying that \"There was some conflict there, yes. He felt in his mind that ''Rocky'' was primarily a feature film, and he did not see it as being translated for cable, so there was a big bone of contention.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/features/sylvester-stallone-rocky-ownership-stake-1203275639/ |title=Sylvester Stallone Feels Robbed of an Ownership Stake in 'Rocky': 'I Was Furious' |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://popculture.com/movies/2019/07/23/sylvester-stallone-reveals-rocky-sequel-prequel-in-development/ |title=Sylvester Stallone Reveals 'Rocky' Sequel and Prequel Are in Development |work= popculture.com |accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBalboa resides in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and married Adriana \"Adrian\" Pennino in 1976. They were married for 26 years. The two have a son, Robert Balboa Jr., who unlike his father goes by Robert.\n\nAfter Adrian's death in 2002, Rocky and his brother-in-law Paulie live together for a short time, then Paulie moves in with an unnamed girlfriend. Now living completely alone again, Rocky cannot come to terms with present-day living and constantly thinks about the past. With the help of Paulie and reunited long-time acquaintance Marie, Rocky begins to move on with his life and in the process restores his relationship with his only child, Robert. Rocky's relationship with Marie is established as platonic in the film, but a hint of romantic interest is revealed with a kiss on the lips the night before the last fight of his life.\n\n==Character origin==\nThe name, iconography, and fighting style of Rocky Balboa were inspired by the legendary heavyweight champion [[Rocky Marciano]] from [[Brockton, Massachusetts]] and from the 5 times world champion [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n|Roberto 'Manos de Piedra (Hands of Stone)' Dur\u00e1n]], from Panama, where the Balboa is the official currency. Balboa was also inspired by other fighting legends: [[Joe Frazier]], for his Philadelphia origin, training methods and victory against [[Muhammad Ali]] (the inspiration for Apollo Creed), and [[Jake LaMotta]], for his [[Italy|Italian]]-inner city roots, ability to absorb many blows and his rivalry with [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], which heavily resembled Rocky and Apollo's. However, it was the not-so-legendary [[Chuck Wepner]] who inspired the movie and Balboa's underdog personality.\n{{Cquote|Early in my acting career I realized the only way I would ever prove myself was to create my own role in my own script. On my 29th birthday, I had $106 in the bank. My best birthday present was a sudden revelation that I had to write the kind of screenplay that I personally enjoyed seeing. I relished stories of heroism, great love, dignity, and courage, dramas of people rising above their stations, taking life by the throat and not letting go until they succeeded. But I had so many ideas in my head, I couldn't focus on any one. To cheer myself up, I took the last of my entertainment money and went to see the [[Muhammad Ali|Ali]]-Wepner fight on closed circuit TV. Chuck Wepner, a battling, bruising club fighter who had never made the big time, was having his shot. It wasn't at all regarded as a serious battle. But as the fight progressed, this miracle unfolded. He hung in there. People went absolutely crazy. Wepner was knocked out in the 15th and final round, almost lasting the distance. We had witnessed an incredible triumph of the human spirit and we loved it.\n\nThat night, Rocky Balboa was born. People looked on him as the all-American tragedy, a man without much mentality and few social graces. But he has deep emotion and spirituality and good patriotism. And he has a good nature, although nature has not been particularly good to him. I have always seen him as a 20th Century gladiator in a pair of sneakers. Like so many of us, he is out of sync with the times. To all this, I injected doses of my own personal life, of my frustration at not getting anywhere.|30px|30px|Sylvester Stallone<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalrocky.com/films/rocky/production.shtml |title=Rocky: Behind the Scenes Rocky (1976) &#124; Making Of Rocky |website=Totalrocky.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-12-01}}</ref>}}\n\n==Boxing style==\nRocky Balboa fights as a [[Southpaw (boxing)|southpaw]] (left-handed). In the second film, against Apollo Creed, he comes out [[Orthodox (boxing)|orthodox]] and Mickey intends for him to switch back to southpaw late in the last round, but Balboa refuses saying \"no tricks, I ain't switching\".  Mickey tells him that Apollo is ready for him (if he continues using his right) and so towards the end of the round, he does indeed lead with his left. The real reason for this is Sylvester Stallone tore his pectoral muscles in training,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} but the idea was probably taken from the great left-handed boxer [[\"Marvelous\" Marvin Hagler]] who would sometimes come out orthodox to confuse opponents.\n\nRocky was an all-or-nothing brawler coming into his first bout with Creed; however, under the training of Mickey, he began to develop his boxing skills which he eventually mastered. During his reign as world champion, he became a class hybrid fighter, possessing the qualities of an inside fighter, brawler, and swarmer. With the exception of his rematch against [[Clubber Lang]] (where he fights as an outside fighter), he often advances quickly upon his opponents, driving them into the ropes in order to attack the body. Balboa's best attribute is without question his near-superhuman ability to [[Chin (combat sports)|absorb a multitude of the hardest hits without falling]] \u2014 an attribute he often employs on purpose to wear down his opponents, sacrificing defensive strategy to land his own punches. Because of this rare talent, Balboa can afford to keep his hands in position to strike rather than up high to block. Because he takes more punches than he throws, it is easy to overlook his incredible punching power. Rocky also has an uncanny ability to sense weakness in his opponents, often capitalizing on every shift in momentum possible. He is acknowledged as having the most devastating body attack in the sport, with his body blows causing internal bleeding in Creed and breaking Drago's ribs. After going two rounds with Balboa, [[Ivan Drago]] told his trainer (in Russian), \"He's not human, he's like a piece of iron.\" [[Rocky Balboa (film)|Mason Dixon]] once remarked about Balboa: \"that guy's got bricks in his gloves.\" These qualities, in concert, helped land him a high percentage of KO victories over the course of his career.\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:Philly042107-014-RockyStatue.jpg|thumb|Rocky Statue, situated just northeast of the [[Rocky Steps]].]]\n\nRocky Balboa was named the 7th greatest movie hero by the [[American Film Institute]] on their ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains]]'' list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains |publisher=afi.com |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref> Additionally, he was ranked #34 on [[Empire Magazine]]'s compilation of ''The 100 Greatest Movie Characters''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=34 |title=''Empire's'' The 100 Greatest Movie Characters |publisher=Empire Magazine |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' magazine ranked Rocky Balboa #64 on their list of ''The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/100characters2.html |title=''Premiere's'' The 100 Greatest Movie Characters |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Rocky character is immortalised with a bronze [[statue]] erected near the Rocky Steps in Philadelphia recalling the famous scene from the original ''Rocky'' movie.\n\nIn 2011, Sylvester Stallone was inducted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] for his work on the Rocky Balboa character, having \"entertained and inspired boxing fans from around the world\".

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader.

Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series.

They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other interlocutors. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech.

In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000!!\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative evidentials=====\nQuotative evidentials provide knowledge of who or where information originated from in speech.

In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015).

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other interlocutors. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech. Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\n====Nested quotations====\n====Crosslinguisic variations====\n=====Quotative verbs=====\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are markers equivalent to full verbs with meanings ''say, speak, mention, tell, etc.''\n<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5-25 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u660e\u65e5 !! \u6674\u308c\u308b !! -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000!!\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative evidentials=====\nQuotative evidentials provide knowledge of who or where information originated from in speech.

Archaeological finds date back to the [[Neolithic]] period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BC. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the [[Roman Empire]] in the first century AD.\n\nThe city grew wealthy from trade [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]]; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the [[Silk Road]] and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the [[Great Colonnade at Palmyra|Great Colonnade]], the [[Temple of Bel]], and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of [[Amorites]], [[Arameans]], and [[Arabs]]. The city's social structure was tribal, and its inhabitants spoke [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]] (a dialect of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]), while using [[Greek language|Greek]] for commercial and diplomatic purposes. [[Greco-Roman world#Culture|Greco-Roman culture]] influenced the [[Culture of Syria|culture]] of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped [[Canaanite religion|local Semitic deities]], [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian]] and [[Arabian mythology|Arab gods]].\n\nBy the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King [[Odaenathus]] defeated [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] Emperor [[Shapur I]]. The king was succeeded by [[regent]] Queen [[Zenobia]], who rebelled against Rome and established the [[Palmyrene Empire]]. In 273, Roman emperor [[Aurelian]] destroyed the city, which was later restored by [[Diocletian]] at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to [[Christianity]] during the fourth century and to [[Islam]] in the centuries following the conquest by the 7th-century [[Rashidun Caliphate]], after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by [[Arabic]].\n\nBefore AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]], having its political organization influenced by the [[Polis|Greek city-state]] model during the first two centuries AD. The city became a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colonia]] during the third century, leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260. Following its destruction in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and later empires. Its destruction by the [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]] in 1400 reduced it to a small village. Under [[French Mandate of Syria|French Mandatory]] rule in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of [[Tadmur]], and the ancient site became available for excavations. During the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2015, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) destroyed large parts of the ancient city, which was recaptured by the [[Syrian Army]] on 2 March 2017.\n\n==Etymology==\nRecords of the name \"Tadmor\" date from the early second millennium BC;{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}} eighteenth century BC tablets from [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] written in [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] record the name as \"Ta-ad-mi-ir\", while Assyrian inscriptions of the eleventh century BC record it as \"Ta-ad-mar\".{{sfn|Limet|1977|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=-5o3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA104 104]}} Aramaic Palmyrene inscriptions themselves showed two variants of the name; ''TDMR'' (''i.e.'', Tadmar) and ''TDMWR'' (''i.e.'', Tadmor).{{sfn|Buben\u00edk|1989|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=DT98F5CFtQsC&pg=PA229 229]}}{{sfn|Wolfensohn|2016|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=m2WSDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT118 118]}} The etymology of the name is unclear; the standard interpretation, supported by [[Albert Schultens]], connects it to the Semitic word for \"[[Date palm#Dates|date palm]]\", ''tamar'' ({{Hebrew|[[:wikt:\u05ea\u05de\u05e8|\u05ea\u05de\u05e8]]}}),{{#tag:ref|The Semitic word T.M.R is the common root for the words that designate palm

Elder]] in the 1st century AD.{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA248 248]}} It was used throughout the [[Greco-Roman]] world.{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n210 200]}} It is generally believed that \"Palmyra\" derives from \"Tadmor\" and linguists have presented two possibilities; one view holds that Palmyra was an alteration of Tadmor.{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n210 200]}} According to the suggestion by Schultens, \"Palmyra\" could have arisen as a corruption of \"Tadmor\", via an unattested form \"Talmura\", changed to \"Palmura\" by the influence of the Latin word ''[[:wikt:palma|palma]]'' (date \"[[Arecaceae|palm]]\"),{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}} in reference to the city's palm trees, then the name reached its final form \"Palmyra\".{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n211 201]}} The second view, supported by some philologists, such as [[Jean Starcky]], holds that Palmyra is a translation of \"Tadmor\" (assuming that it meant palm), which had derived from the Greek word for palm, \"''palame''\".{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}}{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA235 235]}}\n\nAn alternative suggestion connects the name to the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''tedmurt\u0101'' (\u072c\u0715\u0721\u0718\u072a\u072c\u0710) \"miracle\", hence ''tedmurt\u0101'' \"object of wonder\", from the root ''dmr'' \"to wonder\"; this possibility was mentioned favourably by [[Franz Altheim]] and Ruth Altheim-Stiehl (1973), but rejected by Jean Starcky (1960) and Michael Gawlikowski (1974).{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA248 248]}} [[Michael Patrick O'Connor]] (1988) suggested that the names \"Palmyra\" and \"Tadmor\" originated in the [[Hurrian language]].{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}} As evidence, he cited the inexplicability of alterations to the theorized roots of both names (represented in the addition of ''-d-'' to ''tamar'' and ''-ra-'' to ''palame'').{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA235 235]}} According to this theory, \"Tadmor\" derives from the Hurrian word ''tad'' (\"to love\") with the addition of the typical Hurrian [[mid vowel]] rising (mVr) [[formant]] ''mar''.{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA236 236]}} Similarly, according to this theory, \"Palmyra\" derives from the Hurrian word ''pal'' (\"to know\") using the same mVr formant (''mar'').{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p=

[https://books.google.com/books?id=8tIUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA156 156]}} The Palmyrene deity was commonly identified with the Roman god [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] and he had a temple dedicated for him on the

Some scholars criticize the notion of Malakbel's identification with Sol Invictus; according to [[Gaston Halsberghe]], the cult of Malakbel was too local for it to become an imperial Roman god and Aurelian's restoration of Bel's temple and sacrifices dedicated to Malakbel were a sign of his attachment to the sun god in general and his respect to the many ways in which the deity was worshiped.{{sfn|Halsberghe|1972|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=8tIUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA157 157]}} [[Richard Stoneman]] suggested another approach in which Aurelian simply borrowed the imagery of

Archaeological finds date back to the [[Neolithic]] period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BC. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the [[Roman Empire]] in the first century AD.\n\nThe city grew wealthy from trade [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]]; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the [[Silk Road]] and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the [[Great Colonnade at Palmyra|Great Colonnade]], the [[Temple of Bel]], and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of [[Amorites]], [[Arameans]], and [[Arabs]]. The city's social structure was tribal, and its inhabitants spoke [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]] (a dialect of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]), while using [[Greek language|Greek]] for commercial and diplomatic purposes. [[Greco-Roman world#Culture|Greco-Roman culture]] influenced the [[Culture of Syria|culture]] of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped [[Canaanite religion|local Semitic deities]], [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian]] and [[Arabian mythology|Arab gods]].\n\nBy the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King [[Odaenathus]] defeated [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] Emperor [[Shapur I]]. The king was succeeded by [[regent]] Queen [[Zenobia]], who rebelled against Rome and established the [[Palmyrene Empire]]. In 273, Roman emperor [[Aurelian]] destroyed the city, which was later restored by [[Diocletian]] at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to [[Christianity]] during the fourth century and to [[Islam]] in the centuries following the conquest by the 7th-century [[Rashidun Caliphate]], after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by [[Arabic]].\n\nBefore AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]], having its political organization influenced by the [[Polis|Greek city-state]] model during the first two centuries AD. The city became a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colonia]] during the third century, leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260. Following its destruction in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and later empires. Its destruction by the [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]] in 1400 reduced it to a small village. Under [[French Mandate of Syria|French Mandatory]] rule in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of [[Tadmur]], and the ancient site became available for excavations. During the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2015, the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) destroyed large parts of the ancient city, which was recaptured by the [[Syrian Army]] on 2 March 2017.\n\n==Etymology==\nRecords of the name \"Tadmor\" date from the early second millennium BC;{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}} eighteenth century BC tablets from [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] written in [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] record the name as \"Ta-ad-mi-ir\", while Assyrian inscriptions of the eleventh century BC record it as \"Ta-ad-mar\".{{sfn|Limet|1977|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=-5o3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA104 104]}} Aramaic Palmyrene inscriptions themselves showed two variants of the name; ''TDMR'' (''i.e.'', Tadmar) and ''TDMWR'' (''i.e.'', Tadmor).{{sfn|Buben\u00edk|1989|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=DT98F5CFtQsC&pg=PA229 229]}}{{sfn|Wolfensohn|2016|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=m2WSDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT118 118]}} The etymology of the name is unclear; the standard interpretation, supported by [[Albert Schultens]], connects it to the Semitic word for \"[[Date palm#Dates|date palm]]\", ''tamar'' ({{Hebrew|[[:wikt:\u05ea\u05de\u05e8|\u05ea\u05de\u05e8]]}}),{{#tag:ref|The Semitic word T.M.R is the common root for the words that designate palm

445]}}<br />Schultens argued that in the Bible (1 Kings 9:18), the name is written \"Tamor\" in the text and \"Tadmor\" in the margin.{{sfn|Ibn \u0160add\u0101d|1732|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=FCgVAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA3-PT79&lpg=RA3-PT79 79]}} Schultens considered \"Tamor\" to be the original name and derived from \"Tamar\".{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n210 200]}} However, the inclusion of a -''d''- in \"Tamar\" cannot be explained.{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p=

[https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA235 235]}}\n\nThe Greek name {{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1}} (Latinized ''Palmyra'') was first recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] in the 1st century AD.{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA248 248]}} It was used throughout the [[Greco-Roman]] world.{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n210 200]}} It is generally believed that \"Palmyra\" derives from \"Tadmor\" and linguists have presented two possibilities; one view holds that Palmyra was an alteration of Tadmor.{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n210 200]}} According to the suggestion by Schultens, \"Palmyra\" could have arisen as a corruption of \"Tadmor\", via an unattested form \"Talmura\", changed to \"Palmura\" by the influence of the Latin word ''[[:wikt:palma|palma]]'' (date \"[[Arecaceae|palm]]\"),{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}} in reference to the city's palm trees, then the name reached its final form \"Palmyra\".{{sfn|Charnock|1859|p= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_I2BulY4WvsYC/page/n211 201]}} The second view, supported by some philologists, such as [[Jean Starcky]], holds that Palmyra is a translation of \"Tadmor\" (assuming that it meant palm), which had derived from the Greek word for palm, \"''palame''\".{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}}{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA235 235]}}\n\nAn alternative suggestion connects the name to the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''tedmurt\u0101'' (\u072c\u0715\u0721\u0718\u072a\u072c\u0710) \"miracle\", hence ''tedmurt\u0101'' \"object of wonder\", from the root ''dmr'' \"to wonder\"; this possibility was mentioned favourably by [[Franz Altheim]] and Ruth Altheim-Stiehl (1973), but rejected by Jean Starcky (1960) and Michael Gawlikowski (1974).{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA248 248]}} [[Michael Patrick O'Connor]] (1988) suggested that the names \"Palmyra\" and \"Tadmor\" originated in the [[Hurrian language]].{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA238 238]}} As evidence, he cited the inexplicability of alterations to the theorized roots of both names (represented in the addition of ''-d-'' to ''tamar'' and ''-ra-'' to ''palame'').{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA235 235]}} According to this theory, \"Tadmor\" derives from the Hurrian word ''tad'' (\"to love\") with the addition of the typical Hurrian [[mid vowel]] rising (mVr) [[formant]] ''mar''.{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1l_MfEV6kkC&pg=PA236 236]}} Similarly, according to this theory, \"Palmyra\" derives from the Hurrian word ''pal'' (\"to know\") using the same mVr formant (''mar'').{{sfn|O'Connor|1988|p=

over Palmyra, Aurelian dedicated a large temple of [[Sol Invictus]] in Rome;{{sfn|Hijmans|2009|p= 484}} most scholars consider Aurelian's Sol Invictus to be of Syrian origin,{{sfn|Hijmans|2009|p= 485}} either a continuation of emperor [[Elagabalus]] cult of [[Elagabalus (deity)|Sol Invictus Elagabalus]], or Malakbel of Palmyra.{{sfn|Halsberghe|1972|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=8tIUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA156 156]}} The Palmyrene deity was commonly identified with the Roman god [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] and he had a temple dedicated for him on the right bank of the [[Tiber]] since the second century.{{sfn|Watson|2004|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=kJ2JAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA196 196]}} Also, he bore the epithet Invictus and was known with the name

the Palmyrene deity as Aurelian's Sol Invictus is inferred from a passage by [[Zosimus]] reading: \"and the magnificent temple of the sun he (i.e. Aurelian) embellished with votive gifts from Palmyra, setting up statues of [[Helios]] and Bel\".{{sfn|Dirven|1999|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=_LfXg2r6FT0C&pg=PA174 174]}} Three deities from Palmyra exemplified solar features: Malakbel, Yarhibol and \u0160ams, hence the identification of the Palmyrene Helios appearing in Zosimus' work with Malakbel.{{sfn|Dirven|1999|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=_LfXg2r6FT0C&pg=PA174 174]}} Some scholars criticize the notion of Malakbel's identification with Sol Invictus; according to [[Gaston Halsberghe]], the cult of Malakbel was too local for it to become an imperial Roman god and Aurelian's restoration of Bel's temple and sacrifices dedicated to Malakbel were a sign of his attachment to the sun god in general and his respect to the many ways in which the deity was worshiped.{{sfn|Halsberghe|1972|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=8tIUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA157 157]}} [[Richard Stoneman]] suggested another approach in which Aurelian simply borrowed the imagery of Malakbel to enhance his own solar deity.{{sfn|Stoneman|1994|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=8kLFfE1qPhIC&pg=PA185 185]}} The relation between Malakbel and Sol Invictus can not be confirmed and
