Despite the significant differences between Indo-European languages and Dravidian languages, those Hindu calendars which are based on lunar cycle are generally phonetic variants of each other, while the solar cycle are generally variants of each other too, suggesting that the time keeping knowledge travelled widely across the Indian subcontinent in ancient times.<ref name=richmond80/><ref name=\"Reingold2008p275\"/>\n\nThe Tamil lunar month names are forward shifted by a month compared to Vikrami month names, in part because Tamil calendar integrates greater emphasis for the solar cycle in a manner similar to the neighboring Kerala region and it follows the Amanta system for lunar months.

Also illustrates Adhika Masa (Year 2-Bhadrapada) repeats; the first time the Sun moves entirely within Simha Rashi thus rendering it an Adhika Masa]]\nTwelve Hindu mas (m\u0101sa, lunar month) are equal to approximately 354 days, while the length of a sidereal (solar) year is about 365 days. This creates a difference of about eleven days, which is offset every (29.53/10.63) = 2.71 years, or approximately every 32.5 months.<ref name=\"Montgomery2015p103\"/> The twelve months are subdivided into six lunar seasons timed with the agriculture cycles, blooming of natural flowers, fall of leaves, and weather. To account for the mismatch between lunar and solar calendar, the Hindu scholars adopted intercalary months, where a particular month just repeated. The choice of this month was not random, but timed to sync back the two calendars to the cycle of agriculture and nature.<ref name=\"Montgomery2015p103\"/><ref name=\"Reingold2008p275\"/>\n\nThe repetition of a month created the problem of scheduling festivals, weddings and other social events without repetition and confusion. This was resolved by declaring one month as ''Shudha'' (pure, clean, regular, proper, also called ''Deva'' month) and the other ''Mala'' or ''Adhika'' (extra, unclean and inauspicious, also called [[Purushottam Maas|Asura masa]]).<ref name=\"Underhill1991p32\">{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA32|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=20, 32 note 5}}</ref>\n\nThe Indian mathematicians who calculated the best way to adjust the two years, over long periods of a ''yuga'' (era, tables calculating 1000 of years), they determined that the best means to intercalate the months is to time the intercalary months on a 19-year cycle. This intercalation is generally adopted in the 3rd, 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 16th and 19th year of this cycle. Further, the complex rules rule out the repetition of [[Agrahayana|M\u0101rgasirsa]] (also called ''Agahana''), [[Pausha]] and [[Maagha]] lunar months. The historic Hindu texts are not consistent on these rules, with competing ideas flourishing in the Hindu culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Sewell|author2=\u015aa\u1e45kara B\u0101lakr\u0325sh\u1e47a D\u012bkshita|title= The Indian Calendar |year=1896|url= https://archive.org/details/indiancalendarwi00sewerich |publisher=S.

This occurs because of the complexity of the relative lunar, solar and earth movements. According to the Hindu calendar theory, states uriel Marion Underhill, \"when the sun is in perigee, and a lunar month being at its longest, if the new moon immediately precedes a [[Sankranti|samkranti]], then the first of the two lunar months is deleted (called ''nija'' or ''kshaya'').\" This, for example, happened in the year 1 BCE, when there was no new moon between Makara samkranti and Kumbha samkranti, and the month of Pausha was dropped.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=20\u201321}}</ref>\n\n==Day==\nJust like months, the Hindu calendar has two measures of a day, one based on the lunar movement and the other on solar. The solar day or civil day, called ''divasa'' (\t\u0926\u093f\u0935\u0938), has been what most Hindus traditionally use, is easy and empirical to observe, by poor and rich, with or without a clock, and it is defined as the period from one sunrise to another. The lunar day is called ''tithi'' (\u0924\u093f\u0925\u093f), and this is based on complicated measures of lunar movement.

The technical standard makes each ''tithi'' contain different number of hours, but helps the overall integrity of the calendar. Given the variation in the length of a solar day with seasons, and moon's relative movements, the start and end time for ''tithi'' varies over the seasons and over the years, and the ''tithi'' adjusted to sync with ''divasa'' periodically with intercalation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=23\u201328}}</ref>\n\n===Weekday/V\u0101sara===\n''V\u0101sara'' refers to the weekdays in Sanskrit.<ref>[[Monier Monier-Williams]], [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0900/mw__0981.html \u0935\u093e\u0938\u0930], Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, page 948</ref> Also referred to as ''Vara'' and used as a suffix.<ref name=\"Klostermaier2007p490\">{{cite book|author=Klaus K.

[[Sanskrit]]-derived and influenced languages. There are many variations of the names in the regional languages, mostly using alternate names of the celestial bodies involved.\n\n===Five limbs of time===\nThe complete Indian calendars contain five ''angas'' or parts of information: lunar day (tithi), solar day (diwas), [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] (naksatra), planetary joining (yoga) and astronomical period (karanam). This structure gives the calendar the name ''Panchangam''.<ref name=\"Klostermaier2007p490\"/> The first two are discussed above.\n\n====Yoga====\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}\nThe [[Sanskrit]] word Yoga means \"union, joining, attachment\", but in astronomical context, this word means latitudinal and longitudinal information. The longitude of the sun and the longitude of the moon are added, and normalised to a value ranging between 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 (if greater than 360, one subtracts 360). This sum is divided into 27 parts. Each part will now equal 800' (where ' is the symbol of the [[arcminute]] which means 1/60 of a degree). These parts are called the ''yogas''. They are labelled:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n# Vi\u1e63kambha\n# Pr\u012bti\n# \u0100yu\u015bm\u0101n\n# Saubh\u0101gya\n# \u015aobhana\n# Atiga\u1e47\u1e0da\n# Sukarma\n# [[Dhrti]]\n# \u015a\u016bla\n# Ga\u1e47\u1e0da\n# [[V\u1e5bddhi]]\n# [[Dhruva]]\n# Vy\u0101ghat\u0101\n# Har\u1e63a\u1e47a\n# [[Vajra]]\n# [[Siddhi]]\n# Vyatip\u0101ta\n# Variyas\n# Parigha\n# [[\u015aiva]]\n# [[Siddha]]\n# S\u0101dhya\n# \u015aubha\n# \u015aukla\n# [[Brahma]]\n# M\u0101hendra\n# Vaidh\u1e5bti\n{{div col end}}\nAgain, minor variations may exist. The ''yoga'' that is active during sunrise of a day is the prevailing ''yoga'' for the day.\n\n====Kara\u1e47a====\nA '''kara\u1e47a''' is half of a '''[[tithi]]'''. To be precise, a kara\u1e47a is the time required for the angular distance between the sun and the moon to increase in steps of 6\u00b0 starting from 0\u00b0. (Compare with the definition of a tithi.)\n\nSince the tithis are 30 in number, and since 1 tithi = 2 kara\u1e47as, therefore one would logically expect there to be 60 kara\u1e47as. But there are only 11 such kara\u1e47as which fill up those slots to accommodate for those 30 tithis. There are actually 4 \"fixed\" (sthira) kara\u1e47as and 7 \"repeating\" (cara) kara\u1e47as.\n\nThe 4\n# \u015aakuni (\u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u093f)\n# Catu\u1e63p\u0101da (\u091a\u0924\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e\u0926)\n# [[N\u0101ga]] (\u0928\u093e\u0917)\n# Ki\u1e43stughna(\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0918\u094d\u0928)\n\nThe 7 \"repeating\" kara\u1e47as are:<ref name=\"Burgess1989\">{{cite book|author=Ebenezer Burgess|title=S\u00fbrya-Siddh\u00e2nta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC&pg=PA107|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=107\u2013}}</ref>\n# [[Vava]] or Bava (\u092c\u0935)\n# Valava or B\u0101lava (\u092c\u093e\u0932\u0935)\n# Kaulava (\u0915\u094c\u0932\u0935)\n# Taitila or Taitula (\u0924\u0948\u0924\u093f\u0932)\n# [[Gara]] or Garaja (\u0917\u0930\u091c)\n# Va\u1e47ija (\u0935\u0923\u093f\u091c)\n# Vi\u1e63\u1e6di ([[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra]]) (\u092d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e)\n* Now the first half of the 1st ''tithi'' (of \u015aukla Pak\u1e63a) is always ''Ki\u1e43tughna kara\u1e47a''. Hence this '''kara\u1e47a''' is \"fixed\".\n* Next, the 7-repeating kara\u1e47as repeat eight times to cover the next 56 half-''tithis''. Thus these are the \"repeating\" (cara) kara\u1e47as.\n* The 3 remaining half-''tithis'' take the remaining \"fixed\" kara\u1e47as in order. Thus these are also \"fixed\" (sthira).\n* Thus one gets 60 kara\u1e47as from those 11 preset kara\u1e47as.\n\nThe Vedic day begins at sunrise. The kara\u1e47a at sunrise of a particular day shall be the prevailing kara\u1e47a for the whole day.\n(citation needed )\n\n====Nakshatra====\n\n[[Nakshatras]] are divisions of ecliptic, each 13\u00b0 20', starting from 0\u00b0 Aries.

Despite the significant differences between Indo-European languages and Dravidian languages, those Hindu calendars which are based on lunar cycle are generally phonetic variants of each other, while the solar cycle are generally variants of each other too, suggesting that the time keeping knowledge travelled widely across the Indian subcontinent in ancient times.<ref name=richmond80/><ref name=\"Reingold2008p275\"/>\n\nThe Tamil lunar month names are forward shifted by a month compared to Vikrami month names, in part because Tamil calendar integrates greater emphasis for the solar cycle in a manner similar to the neighboring Kerala region and it follows the Amanta system for lunar months. This is in contrast to Vikrami calendar which keeps the Purnimanta system and emphasizes the lunar cycle.<ref>[http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/indian_regional.html Regional Varieties of the Indian Calendars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703200148/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/indian_regional.html |date=3 July 2017 }}, Helmer Aslaksen and Akshay Regulagedda, National University of Singapore (2012)</ref> A few major calendars are summarized below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n  |+ Calendar month names in different Hindu calendars<ref name=richmond80/>\n!#||style=\"background: #ffad66;\" |Vikrami<br>(lunar)<ref name=fuller292/>||Assamese||Bengali||Tamil\n!Odia|| style=\"background: #ffad66;\" |Vikrami<br>(solar)||Malayalam<br>(solar)\n!Kannada/Telugu||Tulu (solar)||Gregorian\n|-\n|1|| align=\"center\" |[[Vaisakha|Vais&#257;kha]] || align=\"center\" |Bohag|| align=\"center\" |Boishakh|| align=\"center\" |Chithirai\n|Baisakha|| align=\"center\" |M\u0113sha|| align=\"center\" |Medam\n|Vais\u0101kha || align=\"center\" |Paggu\n| align=\"center\" | April\u2013May\n|-\n|2|| align=\"center\" |[[Jyeshta]]|| align=\"center\" |Zeth|| align=\"center\" |Jj\u00f4isth\u00f4|| align=\"center\" | Vaigasi\n|Jyestha|| align=\"center\" |Vrisha|| align=\"center\" |Edavam\n|Jyeshta||  align=\"center\" |B\u0113sha||align=\"center\" | May\u2013June\n|-\n|3|| align=\"center\" |[[Aashaadha|&#256;sh&#257;da]] || align=\"center\" |Ahar|| align=\"center\" |Ashar || align=\"center\" | Aani\n|Asadha|| align=\"center\" |Mithuna|| align=\"center\" |Mithunam\n|\u0100sh\u0101da|| align=\"center\" |K\u0101rtel|| align=\"center\" | June\u2013July \n|-\n|4|| align=\"center\" |[[Shraavana]] || align=\"center\" |Xa\u00fcn|| align=\"center\" |Shrab\u00f4n|| align=\"center\" | Aadi\n|Srabana|| align=\"center\" |Karka|| align=\"center\" |Karkadakam\n|Shr\u0101vana||align=\"center\" |Aa\u1e6di|| align=\"center\" |July\u2013August\n|-\n|5|| align=\"center\" |[[Bhadrapada|Bh&#257;dra]] || align=\"center\" |Bhado|| align=\"center\" |Bh\u0101dr\u00f4/Bh\u0101ddur|| align=\"center\" | Aavani\n|Bhadraba|| align=\"center\" |Singa|| align=\"center\" |Chingam\n|Bh\u0101drapada||align=\"center\" |Sona|| align=\"center\" | August\u2013September \n|-\n|6|| align=\"center\" |[[Ashvin|Ashwina]] || align=\"center\" |Ahin|| align=\"center\" |Ashshin|| align=\"center\" | Purattasi\n|Aswina|| align=\"center\" |Kanya|| align=\"center\" |Kanni\n|\u0100swayuja||align=\"center\" |Kanya/Nirn\u0101l|| align=\"center\" |September\u2013October\n|-\n|7|| align=\"center\" |[[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] || align=\"center\" |Kati|| align=\"center\" |Kattik|| align=\"center\" | Aippasi\n|Kartika|| align=\"center\" |Tula|| align=\"center\" |Tulam\n|K\u0101rtika||align=\"center\" |Bontel|| align=\"center\" |October\u2013November \n|-\n|8|| align=\"center\" |M\u0101rgasirsa<br> ([[Agrahayana]]) || align=\"center\" |Agh\u00fcn|| align=\"center\" |Agrohoyon/Aghran|| align=\"center\" | Karthigai\n|Margasira|| align=\"center\" |Vrischika|| align=\"center\" |Vrischikam\n|M\u0101rgasira||align=\"center\" |J\u0101rde|| align=\"center\" |November\u2013December \n|-\n|9|| align=\"center\" |[[Pausha]] || align=\"center\" |Puh|| align=\"center\" |Poush/P\u016bsh|| align=\"center\" |Margazhi\n|Pousa|| align=\"center\" |Dhanus|| align=\"center\" |Dhanu \n|Pushya|| align=\"center\" |Perarde||align=\"center\" |December\u2013January \n|-\n|10|| align=\"center\" |[[Maagha|M&#257;gha]] || align=\"center\" |Magh|| align=\"center\" |Magh|| align=\"center\" |Thai \n|Magha|| align=\"center\" |Makara|| align=\"center\" |Makaram\n|Magha||align=\"center\" |Puyintel|| align=\"center\" |January\u2013February \n|-\n|11|| align=\"center\" |[[Phalguna|Ph&#257;lguna]] || align=\"center\" |Phagun|| align=\"center\" |Ph\u0101lgun/Ph\u0101gun|| align=\"center\" |Maasi\n|Phalguna|| align=\"center\" |Kumbha|| align=\"center\" |Kumbham\n|Phalguna||align=\"center\" |M\u0101yi|| align=\"center\" |February\u2013March \n|-\n|12|| align=\"center\" | [[Chaitra]] || align=\"center\" |S\u00f3t|| align=\"center\" |Choitr\u00f4_Choi\u021b|| align=\"center\" |Panguni\n|Chaitra|| align=\"center\" |Mina|| align=\"center\" |Minam\n|Chaitra|| align=\"center\" |Suggi||align=\"center\" |March\u2013April\n|}\n\n===Corrections between lunar and solar months===\n[[File:Hindu Lunisolar Calendar.ogv|thumb|The astronomical basis of the Hindu lunar months. Also illustrates Adhika Masa (Year 2-Bhadrapada) repeats; the first time the Sun moves entirely within Simha Rashi thus rendering it an Adhika Masa]]\nTwelve Hindu mas (m\u0101sa, lunar month) are equal to approximately 354 days, while the length of a sidereal (solar) year is about 365 days. This creates a difference of about eleven days, which is offset every (29.53/10.63) = 2.71 years, or approximately every 32.5 months.<ref name=\"Montgomery2015p103\"/> The twelve months are subdivided into six lunar seasons timed with the agriculture cycles, blooming of natural flowers, fall of leaves, and weather. To account for the mismatch between lunar and solar calendar, the Hindu scholars adopted intercalary months, where a particular month just repeated. The choice of this month was not random, but timed to sync back the two calendars to the cycle of agriculture and nature.<ref name=\"Montgomery2015p103\"/><ref name=\"Reingold2008p275\"/>\n\nThe repetition of a month created the problem of scheduling festivals, weddings and other social events without repetition and confusion. This was resolved by declaring one month as ''Shudha'' (pure, clean, regular, proper, also called ''Deva'' month) and the other ''Mala'' or ''Adhika'' (extra, unclean and inauspicious, also called [[Purushottam Maas|Asura masa]]).<ref name=\"Underhill1991p32\">{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA32|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=20, 32 note 5}}</ref>\n\nThe Indian mathematicians who calculated the best way to adjust the two years, over long periods of a ''yuga'' (era, tables calculating 1000 of years), they determined that the best means to intercalate the months is to time the intercalary months on a 19-year cycle. This intercalation is generally adopted in the 3rd, 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 16th and 19th year of this cycle. Further, the complex rules rule out the repetition of [[Agrahayana|M\u0101rgasirsa]] (also called ''Agahana''), [[Pausha]] and [[Maagha]] lunar months. The historic Hindu texts are not consistent on these rules, with competing ideas flourishing in the Hindu culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Sewell|author2=\u015aa\u1e45kara B\u0101lakr\u0325sh\u1e47a D\u012bkshita|title= The Indian Calendar |year=1896|url= https://archive.org/details/indiancalendarwi00sewerich |publisher=S.

This occurs because of the complexity of the relative lunar, solar and earth movements. According to the Hindu calendar theory, states uriel Marion Underhill, \"when the sun is in perigee, and a lunar month being at its longest, if the new moon immediately precedes a [[Sankranti|samkranti]], then the first of the two lunar months is deleted (called ''nija'' or ''kshaya'').\" This, for example, happened in the year 1 BCE, when there was no new moon between Makara samkranti and Kumbha samkranti, and the month of Pausha was dropped.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=20\u201321}}</ref>\n\n==Day==\nJust like months, the Hindu calendar has two measures of a day, one based on the lunar movement and the other on solar. The solar day or civil day, called ''divasa'' (\t\u0926\u093f\u0935\u0938), has been what most Hindus traditionally use, is easy and empirical to observe, by poor and rich, with or without a clock, and it is defined as the period from one sunrise to another. The lunar day is called ''tithi'' (\u0924\u093f\u0925\u093f), and this is based on complicated measures of lunar movement. A lunar day or ''tithi'' may, for example, begin in the middle of an afternoon and end next afternoon.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=23, 26\u201327}}</ref> Both these days do not directly correspond to a mathematical measure for a day such as equal 24 hours of a solar year, a fact that the Hindu calendar scholars knew, but the system of ''divasa'' was convenient for the general population. The ''tithi'' have been the basis for timing rituals and festivals, while ''divasa'' for everyday use. The Hindu calendars adjust the mismatch in ''divasa'' and ''tithi'', using a methodology similar to the solar and lunar months.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nA ''Tithi'' is technically defined in Indian texts, states [[John E. Cort]], as \"the time required by the combined motions of the sun and moon to increase (in a bright fortnight) or decrease (in a dark fortnight) their relative distance by twelve degrees of the zodiac.<ref name=\"Cort2001p2\">{{cite book|author=John E.

The technical standard makes each ''tithi'' contain different number of hours, but helps the overall integrity of the calendar. Given the variation in the length of a solar day with seasons, and moon's relative movements, the start and end time for ''tithi'' varies over the seasons and over the years, and the ''tithi'' adjusted to sync with ''divasa'' periodically with intercalation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb9Zc0yPVUUC&pg=PA20|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0523-7|pages=23\u201328}}</ref>\n\n===Weekday/V\u0101sara===\n''V\u0101sara'' refers to the weekdays in Sanskrit.<ref>[[Monier Monier-Williams]], [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0900/mw__0981.html \u0935\u093e\u0938\u0930], Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, page 948</ref> Also referred to as ''Vara'' and used as a suffix.<ref name=\"Klostermaier2007p490\">{{cite book|author=Klaus K.

[[Sanskrit]]-derived and influenced languages. There are many variations of the names in the regional languages, mostly using alternate names of the celestial bodies involved.\n\n===Five limbs of time===\nThe complete Indian calendars contain five ''angas'' or parts of information: lunar day (tithi), solar day (diwas), [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] (naksatra), planetary joining (yoga) and astronomical period (karanam). This structure gives the calendar the name ''Panchangam''.<ref name=\"Klostermaier2007p490\"/> The first two are discussed above.\n\n====Yoga====\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}\nThe [[Sanskrit]] word Yoga means \"union, joining, attachment\", but in astronomical context, this word means latitudinal and longitudinal information. The longitude of the sun and the longitude of the moon are added, and normalised to a value ranging between 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 (if greater than 360, one subtracts 360). This sum is divided into 27 parts. Each part will now equal 800' (where ' is the symbol of the [[arcminute]] which means 1/60 of a degree). These parts are called the ''yogas''. They are labelled:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n# Vi\u1e63kambha\n# Pr\u012bti\n# \u0100yu\u015bm\u0101n\n# Saubh\u0101gya\n# \u015aobhana\n# Atiga\u1e47\u1e0da\n# Sukarma\n# [[Dhrti]]\n# \u015a\u016bla\n# Ga\u1e47\u1e0da\n# [[V\u1e5bddhi]]\n# [[Dhruva]]\n# Vy\u0101ghat\u0101\n# Har\u1e63a\u1e47a\n# [[Vajra]]\n# [[Siddhi]]\n# Vyatip\u0101ta\n# Variyas\n# Parigha\n# [[\u015aiva]]\n# [[Siddha]]\n# S\u0101dhya\n# \u015aubha\n# \u015aukla\n# [[Brahma]]\n# M\u0101hendra\n# Vaidh\u1e5bti\n{{div col end}}\nAgain, minor variations may exist. The ''yoga'' that is active during sunrise of a day is the prevailing ''yoga'' for the day.\n\n====Kara\u1e47a====\nA '''kara\u1e47a''' is half of a '''[[tithi]]'''. To be precise, a kara\u1e47a is the time required for the angular distance between the sun and the moon to increase in steps of 6\u00b0 starting from 0\u00b0. (Compare with the definition of a tithi.)\n\nSince the tithis are 30 in number, and since 1 tithi = 2 kara\u1e47as, therefore one would logically expect there to be 60 kara\u1e47as. But there are only 11 such kara\u1e47as which fill up those slots to accommodate for those 30 tithis. There are actually 4 \"fixed\" (sthira) kara\u1e47as and 7 \"repeating\" (cara) kara\u1e47as.\n\nThe 4\n# \u015aakuni (\u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u093f)\n# Catu\u1e63p\u0101da (\u091a\u0924\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e\u0926)\n# [[N\u0101ga]] (\u0928\u093e\u0917)\n# Ki\u1e43stughna(\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0918\u094d\u0928)\n\nThe 7 \"repeating\" kara\u1e47as are:<ref name=\"Burgess1989\">{{cite book|author=Ebenezer Burgess|title=S\u00fbrya-Siddh\u00e2nta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC&pg=PA107|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=107\u2013}}</ref>\n# [[Vava]] or Bava (\u092c\u0935)\n# Valava or B\u0101lava (\u092c\u093e\u0932\u0935)\n# Kaulava (\u0915\u094c\u0932\u0935)\n# Taitila or Taitula (\u0924\u0948\u0924\u093f\u0932)\n# [[Gara]] or Garaja (\u0917\u0930\u091c)\n# Va\u1e47ija (\u0935\u0923\u093f\u091c)\n# Vi\u1e63\u1e6di ([[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra]]) (\u092d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e)\n* Now the first half of the 1st ''tithi'' (of \u015aukla Pak\u1e63a) is always ''Ki\u1e43tughna kara\u1e47a''. Hence this '''kara\u1e47a''' is \"fixed\".\n* Next, the 7-repeating kara\u1e47as repeat eight times to cover the next 56 half-''tithis''. Thus these are the \"repeating\" (cara) kara\u1e47as.\n* The 3 remaining half-''tithis'' take the remaining \"fixed\" kara\u1e47as in order. Thus these are also \"fixed\" (sthira).\n* Thus one gets 60 kara\u1e47as from those 11 preset kara\u1e47as.\n\nThe Vedic day begins at sunrise. The kara\u1e47a at sunrise of a particular day shall be the prevailing kara\u1e47a for the whole day.\n(citation needed )\n\n====Nakshatra====\n\n[[Nakshatras]] are divisions of ecliptic, each 13\u00b0 20', starting from 0\u00b0 Aries.

The first maser was built by [[Charles H. Townes]], [[James P. Gordon]], and [[Herbert J. Zeiger]] at Columbia University in 1953.  Townes, [[Nikolay Basov]] and [[Alexander Prokhorov]] were awarded the 1964 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for theoretical work leading to the maser.  Masers are used as the timekeeping device in [[atomic clock]]s, and as extremely low-noise microwave [[amplifier]]s in [[radio telescope]]s and deep space [[spacecraft communication]] ground stations.\n\nModern masers can be designed to generate [[electromagnetic wave]]s at not only microwave [[frequencies]] but also radio and infrared frequencies. For this reason Charles Townes suggested replacing  \"microwave\" with the word \"molecular\" as the first word in the acronym ''maser''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1964/townes/lecture/ Charles H. Townes \u2013 Nobel Lecture, page 63]</ref>\n\nThe [[laser]] works by the same principle as the maser, but produces higher frequency [[coherence (physics)|coherent radiation]] at visible wavelengths.  The maser was the forerunner of the laser, inspiring theoretical work by Townes and [[Arthur Leonard Schawlow]] that led to the invention of the laser in 1960 by [[Theodore Maiman]].  When the coherent optical oscillator was first imagined in 1957, it was originally called the \"optical maser\". This was ultimately changed to [[laser]] for \"'''L'''ight '''A'''mplification by '''S'''timulated '''E'''mission of '''R'''adiation\".  [[Gordon Gould]] is credited with creating this acronym in 1957.\n\n==History==\nThe theoretical principles governing the operation of a maser were first described by [[Joseph Weber]] of the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] at the Electron Tube Research Conference in 1952 in [[Ottawa]],<ref>[https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4941 American Institute of Physics Oral History Interview with Weber]</ref> with a summary published in the June 1953 Transactions of the Institute of Radio Engineers Professional Group on Electron Devices,<ref>{{cite book |date=2004 |title=The History of the Laser |url= |author=Mario Bertolotti |publisher=CRC Press |page=180|isbn=978-1420033403}}</ref> and simultaneously by [[Nikolay Basov]] and [[Alexander Prokhorov]] from [[Lebedev Physical Institute|Lebedev Institute of Physics]] at an ''All-Union Conference on Radio-Spectroscopy'' held by the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] in May 1952, subsequently published in October 1954.\n\nIndependently, [[Charles H. Townes|Charles Hard Townes]], [[James P. Gordon]], and H. J. Zeiger built the first ammonia maser at [[Columbia University]] in 1953. This device used stimulated emission in a stream of energized [[ammonia]] molecules to produce amplification of microwaves at a frequency of about 24.0 [[hertz|gigahertz]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=J.

Thus, the original acronym is sometimes modified, as suggested by Charles H.

The first maser was built by [[Charles H. Townes]], [[James P. Gordon]], and [[Herbert J. Zeiger]] at Columbia University in 1953.  Townes, [[Nikolay Basov]] and [[Alexander Prokhorov]] were awarded the 1964 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for theoretical work leading to the maser.  Masers are used as the timekeeping device in [[atomic clock]]s, and as extremely low-noise microwave [[amplifier]]s in [[radio telescope]]s and deep space [[spacecraft communication]] ground stations.\n\nModern masers can be designed to generate [[electromagnetic wave]]s at not only microwave [[frequency|frequencies]] but also radio and infrared frequencies. For this reason Charles Townes suggested replacing  \"microwave\" with the word \"molecular\" as the first word in the acronym ''maser''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1964/townes/lecture/ Charles H. Townes \u2013 Nobel Lecture, page 63]</ref>\n\nThe [[laser]] works by the same principle as the maser, but produces higher frequency [[coherence (physics)|coherent radiation]] at visible wavelengths.  The maser was the forerunner of the laser, inspiring theoretical work by Townes and [[Arthur Leonard Schawlow]] that led to the invention of the laser in 1960 by [[Theodore Maiman]].  When the coherent optical oscillator was first imagined in 1957, it was originally called the \"optical maser\". This was ultimately changed to [[laser]] for \"Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation\".  [[Gordon Gould]] is credited with creating this acronym in 1957.\n\n==History==\nThe theoretical principles governing the operation of a maser were first described by [[Joseph Weber]] of the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] at the Electron Tube Research Conference in 1952 in [[Ottawa]],<ref>[https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4941 American Institute of Physics Oral History Interview with Weber]</ref> with a summary published in the June 1953 Transactions of the Institute of Radio Engineers Professional Group on Electron Devices,<ref>{{cite book |date=2004 |title=The History of the Laser |url= |author=Mario Bertolotti |publisher=CRC Press |page=180|isbn=978-1420033403}}</ref> and simultaneously by [[Nikolay Basov]] and [[Alexander Prokhorov]] from [[Lebedev Physical Institute|Lebedev Institute of Physics]] at an ''All-Union Conference on Radio-Spectroscopy'' held by the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] in May 1952, subsequently published in October 1954.\n\nIndependently, [[Charles H. Townes|Charles Hard Townes]], [[James P. Gordon]], and H. J. Zeiger built the first ammonia maser at [[Columbia University]] in 1953. This device used stimulated emission in a stream of energized [[ammonia]] molecules to produce amplification of microwaves at a frequency of about 24.0 [[hertz|gigahertz]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=J.

Initially the acronym was universally given as \"microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\", which described devices which emitted in the microwave region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].\n\nThe principle and concept of stimulated emission has since been extended to more devices and frequencies. Thus, the original acronym is sometimes modified, as suggested by Charles H. Townes,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> to \"''molecular'' amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.\" Some have asserted that Townes's efforts to extend the acronym in this way were primarily motivated by the desire to increase the importance of his invention, and his reputation in the scientific community.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Nick |title=LASER: The inventor, the Nobel laureate, and the thirty-year patent war |year=2000 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-83515-0 }}</ref> <!--''Molecular'' is used here in the sense of [[kinetic theory]], where the base element of a kinetic system is a [[molecule]], even if it happens to be [[monatomic]]. This should not be confused with the usage of the term in the molecular sciences, where it refers to a [[bound state]] comprising two or more atoms.-->\n\nWhen the laser was developed, Townes and [[Arthur Schawlow|Schawlow]] and their colleagues at Bell Labs pushed the use of the term ''optical maser'', but this was largely abandoned in favor of ''laser'', coined by their rival Gordon Gould.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Nick |title=LASER: The inventor, the Nobel laureate, and the thirty-year patent war |year=2000 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-83515-0|pages=66\u201370}}</ref> In modern usage, devices that emit in the [[X-ray]] through [[infrared]] portions of the spectrum are typically called [[laser]]s, and devices that emit in the microwave region and below are commonly called ''masers'', regardless of whether they emit microwaves or other frequencies.\n\nGould originally proposed distinct names for devices that emit in each portion of the spectrum, including  ''grasers'' ([[gamma ray]] lasers), ''xasers'' (x-ray lasers), ''uvasers'' ([[ultraviolet]] lasers), '' lasers'' ([[visible light|visible]] lasers), ''irasers'' ([[infrared]] lasers), ''masers'' (microwave masers), and ''rasers'' ([[radio frequency|RF]] masers). Most of these terms never caught on, however, and all have now become (apart from in science fiction) obsolete except for ''maser'' and ''laser''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Spaser]]\n*[[List of laser types]]\n*[[Astrophysical maser]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* J.R.

as '''Chekiang'''), is an [[East China|eastern]], coastal [[province of China|province]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Hangzhou]]. Zhejiang is bordered by [[Jiangsu]] and [[Shanghai]] to the north, [[Anhui]] to the northwest, [[Jiangxi]] to the west, and [[Fujian]] to the south. To the east is the [[East China Sea]], beyond which lie the [[Ryukyu Islands]] of [[Japan]]. The population of Zhejiang stands at 57 million, the 10th highest among China. Other notable cities include [[Ningbo]] and [[Wenzhou]]. It has been called 'the backbone of China' due to being a major driving force in the Chinese economy and being the birthplace of several notable persons, including the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and entrepreneur [[Jack Ma]].\n\nThe area of Zhejiang was controlled by the [[Yue (state)|Kingdom of Yue]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. The [[Qin Empire]] later annexed it in 222 BC. Under the late [[Ming dynasty]] and the [[Qing dynasty]] that followed it, Zhejiang's ports became important centers of international trade. It was occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino-Japanese war]] and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the [[Reorganized National Government of China]]. After Japan's defeat, Zhejiang's economy became stagnant under [[Mao Zedong]]'s policies.<ref name=\"wiley\" />\n\nNevertheless, after [[Chinese economic reform|China's economic reform]], Zhejiang has grown to be considered one of China's wealthiest provinces, ranking [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|fourth in GDP]] nationally and [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|fifth by GDP per capita]], with a nominal GDP of [[Renminbi|CN\uffe5]]5.62 trilion ([[United States dollar|US$]]849 billion) as of 2018. Zhejiang's economy is based on electromechanical industries, [[textiles]], chemical industries, food, and construction materials.\n\nZhejiang consists mostly of hills, which account for about 70% of its total area, with higher altitudes towards the south and the west. Zhejiang has China's longest [[coast]]line. The [[Qiantang River]] runs through the province, from which it derives its name. Included in the province are three thousand islands, the most in China. The capital [[Hangzhou]] marks the end of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]], and lies on [[Hangzhou Bay]] on the north of Zhejiang, which separates [[Shanghai]] and [[Ningbo]]. The bay contains many small islands collectively called the [[Zhoushan Islands]].\n\n[[Hangzhou]] is a historically important city of China, and is considered a [[Global city|World City]] with a \"Beta+\" classification according to [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2018t.html|title=GaWC - The World According to GaWC 2018|website=www.lboro.ac.uk|access-date=2019-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503165246/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2016t.html|archive-date=3 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> It includes the notable [[West Lake]].

Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as Dongyue and the [[Ouyue]].\n\nThe [[kingdom of Yue]] began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was in northern Zhejiang. [[Shiji]] claims that its leaders were descended from the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] founder [[Yu the Great]]. The \"[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]\" ({{zh|c=\u8d8a\u4eba\u6b4c |p=Yu\u00e8r\u00e9n G\u0113 |l=Song of the man of Yue}}) was transliterated into Chinese and recorded by authors in north China or inland China of Hebei and Henan around 528 BC. The song shows that the Yue people spoke a language that was mutually unintelligible with the dialects spoken in north and inland China. The [[Sword of Goujian]] bears [[bird-worm seal script]]. [[Yuen\u00fc]] ({{zh|c=\u8d8a\u5973 |p=Yu\u00e8n\u01da |w=Y\u00fceh-n\u00fc |l=the Lady of Yue |links=no}}) was a swordswoman from the state of Yue. To check the growth of the [[Wu (state)|kingdom of Wu]], [[state of Chu|Chu]] pursued a policy of strengthening Yue.\n\nUnder [[Goujian|King Goujian]], Yue recovered from its early reverses and fully annexed the lands of its rival in {{nowrap|473 BC}}. The Yue kings then moved their capital center from their original home around [[Mount Kuaiji]] in present-day [[Shaoxing]] to the former Wu capital at present-day [[Suzhou]]. With no southern power to turn against Yue, Chu opposed it directly and, in 333&nbsp;BC, succeeded in destroying it. Yue's former lands were annexed by the [[Qin Empire]] in 222&nbsp;BC and organized into a [[commandery (China)|commandery]] named for Kuaiji in Zhejiang but initially headquartered in [[Wu County|Wu]] in [[Jiangsu]].\n\n===Han and the Three Kingdoms===\n[[Kuaiji Commandery]] was the initial power base for [[Xiang Liang]] and [[Xiang Yu]]'s rebellion against the [[Qin Empire]] which initially succeeded in restoring the kingdom of Chu but [[Chu-Han contention|eventually fell]] to the [[Han dynasty|Han]]. Under the [[Eastern Han|Later Han]], control of the area returned to the settlement below [[Mount Kuaiji]] but authority over the [[Minyue]] hinterland was nominal at best and its Yue inhabitants largely retained their own political and social structures.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Three Kingdoms]] era (220\u2013280 CE), Zhejiang was home to the warlords [[Yan Baihu]] and [[Wang Lang]] prior to their defeat by [[Sun Ce]] and [[Sun Quan]], who eventually established the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]]. Despite the removal of their court from Kuaiji to [[Jiankang|Jianye]] (present-day [[Nanjing]]), and they continued development of the region and benefitted from influxes of refugees fleeing the turmoil in northern China. Industrial kilns were established and trade reached as far as [[Manchuria]] and [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] ([[South Vietnam]]).\n\nZhejiang was part of the [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]]. Wu (229\u2013280), commonly known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, had been the economically most developed state among the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220\u2013280 CE). The historical novel [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] records that Zhejiang had the best-equipped, strong navy force. The story depicts how the states of [[Wei (state)|Wei]] ({{lang|zh|\u9b4f}}) and [[Shu (state)|Shu]] ({{lang|zh|\u8700}}), lack of material resources, avoided direct confrontation with the Wu. In armed military conflicts with Wu, the two states relied intensively on tactics of camouflage and deception to steal Wu's military resources including arrows and bows.\n\n===Six Dynasties===\n\nDespite the continuing prominence of [[Nanjing]] (then known as Jiankang), the settlement of Qiantang, the former name of [[Hangzhou]], remained one of the three major metropolitan centers in the south to provide major tax revenue to the imperial centers in the north China. The other two centers in the south were Jiankang and [[Chengdu]]. In 589, Qiantang was raised in status and renamed [[Hangzhou]].\n\nFollowing the fall of [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] and the turmoil of the [[Wu Hu uprising]] against the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)]], most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refuge in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near [[Hangzhou]]. For example, the clan of [[Zhuge Liang]] (181\u2013234), a chancellor of the state of [[Shu Han]] from [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] in north China during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, gathered together at the suburb of [[Hangzhou]], forming an exclusive, closed village [[Zhuge Village]] (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge.\" The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] might have taken refugee in south of the Yangtze River. However, considering the mountainous geography and relative lack of agrarian lands in Zhejiang, most of these refugees might have resided in some areas in south China beyond Zhejiang, where fertile agrarian lands and metropolitan resources were available,  mainly southern [[Jiangsu]], eastern [[Fujian]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Hunan]], [[Anhui]], and provinces where less cohesive, organized regional governments had been in place. Metropolitan areas of [[Sichuan]] was another hub for refugees, given that the state of [[Shu (state)|Shu]] had long been founded and ruled by political and military elites from the Central Plain and north China. Some refugees from the north China might have found residence in south China depending on their social status and military power in the north. The [[Eastern Jin|rump Jin state]] or the [[Southern dynasties]] vied against some elite Chinese from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] and south of the Yangtze River.\n\n===Sui and Tang eras===\nZhejiang, as the heartland of the [[Jiangnan]] (Yangtze River Delta), remained the wealthiest area during the [[Six Dynasties]] (220 or 222\u2013589), Sui, and Tang. After being incorporated into the [[Sui dynasty]], its economic richness was used for the [[Sui dynasty]]'s ambitions to expand north and south, particularly into [[Goguryeo\u2013Sui War|Korea]] and Vietnam. The plan led the [[Sui dynasty]] to restore and expand the network which became the [[Grand Canal of China]]. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the [[Zhe River]] and the shores of [[Hangzhou Bay]]), and from [[Suzhou]], and thence to the [[North China Plain]]. The d\u00e9b\u00e2cle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country. Zhejiang was an important economic center of the empire's [[Jiangnan]] East Circuit and was considered particularly prosperous. Throughout the [[Tang dynasty]], The Grand Canal had remained effective, transporting grains and material resources to [[North China plain]] and metropolitan centers of the empire. As the Tang dynasty disintegrated, Zhejiang constituted most of the territory of the regional kingdom of [[Wuyue]].\n\n===Wuyue era===\n[[File:QIAN_Liu_(aka_TSIEN_Liu),_King_of_Wuyue.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Portrait of [[Qian Liu]], the King of [[Wuyue]].]]\nAfter the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907, the entire area of what is now Zhejiang fell under the control of the kingdom [[Wuyue]] established by King [[Qian Liu]], who selected [[Hangzhou]] (a city in the modern day area of Zhejiang) as his kingdom's capital. Despite being under Wuyue rule for a relatively short period of time, Zhejiang underwent a long period of financial and cultural prosperity which continued even after the kingdom fell.\n\nAfter Wuyue was conquered during the reunification of China, many shrines were erected across the former territories of Wuyue, mainly in Zhejiang, where the kings of Wuyue were memorialised, and sometimes, worshipped as being able to dictate weather and agriculture. Many of these shrines, known as \"Shrine of the Qian King\" or \"Temple to the Qian King,\" still remain today, with the most popularly visited example being that near [[West Lake]] in Hangzhou.\n \nChina's province of Zhejiang during the 940s was also the place of origin of the [[Hu (surname)|H\u00fa]] family (H\u1ed3 in Vietnamese) from which the founder of the [[H\u1ed3 Dynasty]] who ruled Vietnam, Emperor [[H\u1ed3 Qu\u00fd Ly]], came from.<ref name=\"Taylor2013\">{{cite book|author=K.

Under the Song, the prosperity of South China began to overtake that of North China. After the north was lost to the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jurchen Jin|Jin dynasty]] in 1127 following the [[Jingkang Incident]], Hangzhou became the capital of the Song dynasty under the name [[Hangzhou|Lin'an]], which was renowned for its prosperity and beauty, it was suspected to have been the largest city in the world at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |title=Largest Cities Through History |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=2013-07-19 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527095609/http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |archive-date=27 May 2005 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nFrom then on, northern Zhejiang and neighboring southern Jiangsu have been synonymous with luxury and opulence in Chinese culture.

Longquan greenware is characterized by a thick unctuous glaze of a particular bluish-green tint over an otherwise undecorated light-grey porcellaneous body that is delicately potted. Yuan Longquan celadons feature a thinner, greener glaze on larger vessels with decoration and shapes derived from Middle Eastern ceramic and metalwares. These were produced in large quantities for the Chinese export trade to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and (during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]) Europe. By the Ming, however, production was notably deficient in quality. It is in this period that the Longquan kilns declined, to be eventually replaced in popularity and ceramic production by the kilns of [[Jingdezhen]] in [[Jiangxi]].<ref>Vainker, Shelaugh. <u>Chinese Pottery and Porcelain.</u> London: British Museum Press, 1991.</ref>\n\n===Yuan and Ming eras===\n[[File:Ceramic planter from the Ming Dynasty.jpg|thumb|This tripod planter from the [[Ming dynasty]] was found in Zhejiang province.

So far as my own observations go, after residing for a quarter of a century in half the provinces of China, north, south, east, and west, I should be inclined to describe slavery in China as totally invisible to the naked eye ; personal liberty is absolute where feebleness or ignorance do not expose the subject to the rapacity of mandarins, relatives, or speculators. Even savages and foreigners are welcomed as equals, so long as they conform unreservedly to Chinese custom. On the other hand, the oldfashioned social disabilities of policemen, barbers, and playactors still exist in the eyes of the law, though any idea of caste is totally absent therefrom, and \"unofficially\" these individuals are as good as any other free men.  Having now taken a cursory view of Chinese slavery from its historical aspect, let us see what it is in practice. Though the penal code forbids and annuls the sale into slavery of free persons, even by a husband, father, or grandfather, yet the number of free persons who are sold or sell themselves to escape starvation and misery is considerable. It is nominally a punishable offence to keep a free man or lost child as a slave; also for parents to sell their children without the consent of the latter, or to drown their girls; but in practice the law is in both cases ignored, and scarcely ever enforced ; ''a fortiori'' the minor offence of selling children, even with their consent. Indeed, sales of girls for secondary wives is of daily occurrence, and, as we have seen, the Emperors Yung-cheng and K'ien-lung explicitly recognized the right of parents to sell children in times of famine, whilst the missionaries unanimously bear witness to the fact that the public sale of children in the streets\u2014for instance, of Tientsin\u2014was frequently witnessed during recent times of dearth. But slave markets and public sales are unknown in a general way. Occasionally old parents sell their children in order to purchase coffins for themselves.

Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], signed in 1843, Ningbo became one of the five Chinese [[treaty ports]] opened to virtually unrestricted foreign trade.  Much of Zhejiang came under the control of the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] during the [[Taiping Rebellion]], which resulted in a considerable loss of life in the north-western and central parts of the province, sparing the rest of Zhejiang from the disastrous depopulation that occurred. In 1876, [[Wenzhou]] became Zhejiang's second treaty port. [[Jianghuai Mandarin]] speakers later came to settle in these depopulated regions of northern Zhejiang.\n\n=== Republican era===\n\n{{See also|Chekiang Province, Republic of China}}\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], which led into [[World War II]], much of Zhejiang was occupied by Japan and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the [[Reorganized National Government of China]]. Following the [[Doolittle Raid]], most of the B-25 American crews that came down in China eventually made it to safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. The Chinese people who helped them, however, paid dearly for sheltering the Americans. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] began the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign]] to intimidate the Chinese out of helping downed American airmen.

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u201376), Zhejiang was in chaos and disunity, and its economy was stagnant, especially during the high tide (1966\u201369) of the revolution. The agricultural policy favoring grain production at the expense of industrial and cash crops intensified economic hardships in the province. Mao's self-reliance policy and the reduction in maritime trade cut off the lifelines of the port cities of Ningbo and Wenzhou.

The [[Governor of Zhejiang]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Zhejiang. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor is subordinate to the Zhejiang [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the \"Zhejiang [[CPC Party Chief]].\"\n\nSeveral political figures who served as Zhejiang's top political office of Communist Party Secretary have played key roles in various events in PRC history. [[Tan Zhenlin]] (term 1949-1952), the inaugural Party Secretary, was one of the leading voices against Mao's [[Cultural Revolution]] during the so-called [[February Countercurrent]] of 1967. [[Jiang Hua]] (term 1956-1968), was the \"chief justice\" on the Special Court in the case against the [[Gang of Four]] in 1980. Three provincial Party Secretaries since the 1990s have gone onto prominence at the national level. They include CPC General Secretary and President [[Xi Jinping]] (term 2002-2007), [[National People's Congress]] Chairman and former Vice-Premier [[Zhang Dejiang]] (term 1998-2002), and [[Zhao Hongzhu]] (term 2007-2012), the Deputy Secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], China's top anti-corruption body. Of Zhejiang's fourteen Party Secretaries since 1949, none were native to the province.\n\nZhejiang was home to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and many high-ranking officials in the [[Kuomintang]], who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Civil War.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Dayu Bay - YuAo Cun - P1210476.JPG|thumb|Yuao, a fishing village on Dayu Bay in south Zhejiang ([[Cangnan County]])]]\n\nZhejiang is one of the richest and most developed provinces in China. As of 2018, its [[Gross domestic product|nominal GDP]] was [[United States dollar|US$]]849 billion ([[Renminbi|CN\uffe5]] 5.62 trilion), about 6.24% of the country's GDP and ranked [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|4th]] among [[Administrative divisions of China|province-level administrative units]]; the province's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth CN\uffe5196.70 billion (US$29.72 billion), CN\uffe52.3506 trillion (US$355.22 billion), and CN\uffe53.0724 trillion (US$464.29 billion) respectively. Its nominal GDP per capita was US$14,907 (CN\uffe598,643) and ranked the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|5th]] in the country. The private sector in the province has been playing an increasingly important role in boosting the regional economy since [[Chinese economic reform|Economic Reform]] in 1978.<ref name=\"SNA2008\"/>\n\nZhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, [[textiles]], chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model,\" which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into [[infrastructure]], and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.<ref name=\"thechinaperspective.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/zhejiang-province/ |title=China Economy @ China Perspective |publisher=Thechinaperspective.com |date=2013-09-06 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045925/http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/zhejiang-province/ |archive-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou.<ref name=wiley/> The [[Per-Capita Disposable Income|per capita disposable income]] of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 55,574 yuan (US$8,398) in 2018, an annual real growth of 8.4%.

North Zhejiang, known as the \"Land of Fish and Rice,\" is characterized by its canals and waterways.]]\n\n===Languages===\nZhejiang is mountainous and has therefore fostered the development of many distinct local cultures. Linguistically speaking, Zhejiang is extremely diverse. Most inhabitants of Zhejiang speak [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], but the Wu dialects are very diverse, especially in the south, where one valley may speak a dialect completely unintelligible to the next valley a few kilometers away. Other [[varieties of Chinese]] are spoken as well, mostly along the borders; [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] dialects are spoken on the border with Anhui, while [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects are spoken on the border with Fujian. (See [[Hangzhou dialect]], [[Shaoxing dialect]], [[Ningbo dialect]], [[Wenzhou dialect]], [[Taizhou dialect]], [[Jinhua dialect]], and [[Quzhou dialect]] for more information).\n\nThroughout history there have been a series of ''[[lingua franca]]s'' in the area to allow for better communication. The dialects spoken in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo have taken on this role historically. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], which is not mutually intelligible with any of the local dialects, has been promoted as the standard language of communication throughout China. As a result, most of the population now can, to some degree, speak and comprehend Mandarin and can [[Code-switching|code-switch]] when necessary. A majority of the population educated since 1978 can speak Mandarin. Urban residents tend to be more fluent in Mandarin than rural people. Nevertheless, a Zhejiang accent is detectable in almost everyone from the area communicating in Mandarin, and the home dialect remains an important part of the everyday lives and cultural identities of most Zhejiang residents.\n\n===Music===\nZhejiang is the home of [[Yue opera]], one of the most prominent forms of [[Chinese opera]]. ''Yueju'' originated in [[Shengzhou]] and is traditionally performed by actresses only, in both male and female roles. Other important opera traditions include Yongju (of Ningbo), [[Shao opera]] (of [[Shaoxing]]), [[Ouju]] (of Wenzhou), [[Wuju]] (of [[Jinhua]]), Taizhou Luantan (of Taizhou) and Zhuji Luantan (of [[Zhuji]]).\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Cangnan - Pacao - P1210261.JPG|thumb|Fish being dried dockside in Pacao Harbor, [[Cangnan County]]]]\nLongjing tea (also called dragon well tea), originating in Hangzhou, is one of the most prestigious, if not ''the'' most prestigious Chinese tea. Hangzhou is also renowned for its silk umbrellas and hand fans. [[Zhejiang cuisine]] (itself subdivided into many traditions, including Hangzhou cuisine) is one of the eight great traditions of [[Chinese cuisine]].\n\n===Place names===\nSince ancient times, north Zhejiang and neighbouring south Jiangsu have been famed for their prosperity and opulence{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}, and simply inserting north Zhejiang place names (Hangzhou, Jiaxing, etc.) into poetry gave an effect of dreaminess, a practice followed by many noted poets. In particular, the fame of Hangzhou (as well as [[Suzhou]] in neighbouring Jiangsu province) has led to the popular saying: \"Above there is heaven; below there is Suzhou and Hangzhou\" ({{zh|s=\u4e0a\u6709\u5929\u5802\uff0c\u4e0b\u6709\u82cf\u676d|labels=no}}), a saying that continues to be a source of pride for the people of these two still prosperous cities.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Guoqingsi006r.jpg|thumb|The Hall of Five Hundred [[Arhat]]s at [[Guoqing Temple]]]]\n\nTourist destinations in Zhejiang include:\n*[[Baoguo Temple (Ningbo)|Baoguo Temple]], one of the oldest intact wooden structures in Southern China, {{Convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} north of Ningbo.\n*[[Mount Putuo]], one of the most noted Buddhist mountains in China.

({{zh|labels=no |c=\u6d59\u6c5f}}, [[Postal romanization|alternately romanized]] as '''Chekiang'''), is an [[East China|eastern]], coastal [[province of China|province]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Hangzhou]]. Zhejiang is bordered by [[Jiangsu]] and [[Shanghai]] to the north, [[Anhui]] to the northwest, [[Jiangxi]] to the west, and [[Fujian]] to the south. To the east is the [[East China Sea]], beyond which lie the [[Ryukyu Islands]] of [[Japan]]. The population of Zhejiang stands at 57 million, the 10th highest among China. Other notable cities include [[Ningbo]] and [[Wenzhou]]. It has been called 'the backbone of China' due to being a major driving force in the Chinese economy and being the birthplace of several notable persons, including the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and entrepreneur [[Jack Ma]].\n\nThe area of Zhejiang was controlled by the [[Yue (state)|Kingdom of Yue]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. The [[Qin Empire]] later annexed it in 222 BC. Under the late [[Ming dynasty]] and the [[Qing dynasty]] that followed it, Zhejiang's ports became important centers of international trade. It was occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino-Japanese war]] and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the [[Reorganized National Government of China]]. After Japan's defeat, Zhejiang's economy became stagnant under [[Mao Zedong]]'s policies.<ref name=\"wiley\" />\n\nNevertheless, after [[Chinese economic reform|China's economic reform]], Zhejiang has grown to be considered one of China's wealthiest provinces, ranking [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|fourth in GDP]] nationally and [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|fifth by GDP per capita]], with a nominal GDP of [[Renminbi|CN\uffe5]]5.62 trilion ([[United States dollar|US$]]849 billion) as of 2018. Zhejiang's economy is based on electromechanical industries, [[textiles]], chemical industries, food, and construction materials.\n\nZhejiang consists mostly of hills, which account for about 70% of its total area, with higher altitudes towards the south and the west. Zhejiang has China's longest [[coast]]line. The [[Qiantang River]] runs through the province, from which it derives its name. Included in the province are three thousand islands, the most in China. The capital [[Hangzhou]] marks the end of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]], and lies on [[Hangzhou Bay]] on the north of Zhejiang, which separates [[Shanghai]] and [[Ningbo]]. The bay contains many small islands collectively called the [[Zhoushan Islands]].\n\n[[Hangzhou]] is a historically important city of China, and is considered a [[Global city|World City]] with a \"Beta+\" classification according to [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2018t.html|title=GaWC - The World According to GaWC 2018|website=www.lboro.ac.uk|access-date=2019-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503165246/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2016t.html|archive-date=3 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> It includes the notable [[West Lake]].

Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as Dongyue and the [[Ouyue]].\n\nThe [[kingdom of Yue]] began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was in northern Zhejiang. [[Shiji]] claims that its leaders were descended from the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] founder [[Yu the Great]]. The \"[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]\" ({{zh|c=\u8d8a\u4eba\u6b4c |p=Yu\u00e8r\u00e9n G\u0113 |l=Song of the man of Yue}}) was transliterated into Chinese and recorded by authors in north China or inland China of Hebei and Henan around 528 BC. The song shows that the Yue people spoke a language that was mutually unintelligible with the dialects spoken in north and inland China. The [[Sword of Goujian]] bears [[bird-worm seal script]]. [[Yuen\u00fc]] ({{zh|c=\u8d8a\u5973 |p=Yu\u00e8n\u01da |w=Y\u00fceh-n\u00fc |l=the Lady of Yue |links=no}}) was a swordswoman from the state of Yue. To check the growth of the [[Wu (state)|kingdom of Wu]], [[state of Chu|Chu]] pursued a policy of strengthening Yue.\n\nUnder [[Goujian|King Goujian]], Yue recovered from its early reverses and fully annexed the lands of its rival in {{nowrap|473 BC}}. The Yue kings then moved their capital center from their original home around [[Mount Kuaiji]] in present-day [[Shaoxing]] to the former Wu capital at present-day [[Suzhou]]. With no southern power to turn against Yue, Chu opposed it directly and, in 333&nbsp;BC, succeeded in destroying it. Yue's former lands were annexed by the [[Qin Empire]] in 222&nbsp;BC and organized into a [[commandery (China)|commandery]] named for Kuaiji in Zhejiang but initially headquartered in [[Wu County|Wu]] in [[Jiangsu]].\n\n===Han and the Three Kingdoms===\n[[Kuaiji Commandery]] was the initial power base for [[Xiang Liang]] and [[Xiang Yu]]'s rebellion against the [[Qin Empire]] which initially succeeded in restoring the kingdom of Chu but [[Chu-Han contention|eventually fell]] to the [[Han dynasty|Han]]. Under the [[Eastern Han|Later Han]], control of the area returned to the settlement below [[Mount Kuaiji]] but authority over the [[Minyue]] hinterland was nominal at best and its Yue inhabitants largely retained their own political and social structures.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Three Kingdoms]] era (220\u2013280 CE), Zhejiang was home to the warlords [[Yan Baihu]] and [[Wang Lang]] prior to their defeat by [[Sun Ce]] and [[Sun Quan]], who eventually established the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]]. Despite the removal of their court from Kuaiji to [[Jiankang|Jianye]] (present-day [[Nanjing]]), and they continued development of the region and benefitted from influxes of refugees fleeing the turmoil in northern China. Industrial kilns were established and trade reached as far as [[Manchuria]] and [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] ([[South Vietnam]]).\n\nZhejiang was part of the [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]]. Wu (229\u2013280), commonly known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, had been the economically most developed state among the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220\u2013280 CE). The historical novel [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] records that Zhejiang had the best-equipped, strong navy force. The story depicts how the states of [[Wei (state)|Wei]] ({{lang|zh|\u9b4f}}) and [[Shu (state)|Shu]] ({{lang|zh|\u8700}}), lack of material resources, avoided direct confrontation with the Wu. In armed military conflicts with Wu, the two states relied intensively on tactics of camouflage and deception to steal Wu's military resources including arrows and bows.\n\n===Six Dynasties===\n\nDespite the continuing prominence of [[Nanjing]] (then known as Jiankang), the settlement of Qiantang, the former name of [[Hangzhou]], remained one of the three major metropolitan centers in the south to provide major tax revenue to the imperial centers in the north China. The other two centers in the south were Jiankang and [[Chengdu]]. In 589, Qiantang was raised in status and renamed [[Hangzhou]].\n\nFollowing the fall of [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] and the turmoil of the [[Wu Hu uprising]] against the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)]], most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refuge in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near [[Hangzhou]]. For example, the clan of [[Zhuge Liang]] (181\u2013234), a chancellor of the state of [[Shu Han]] from [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] in north China during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, gathered together at the suburb of [[Hangzhou]], forming an exclusive, closed village [[Zhuge Village]] (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge.\" The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] might have taken refugee in south of the Yangtze River. However, considering the mountainous geography and relative lack of agrarian lands in Zhejiang, most of these refugees might have resided in some areas in south China beyond Zhejiang, where fertile agrarian lands and metropolitan resources were available,  mainly southern [[Jiangsu]], eastern [[Fujian]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Hunan]], [[Anhui]], and provinces where less cohesive, organized regional governments had been in place. Metropolitan areas of [[Sichuan]] was another hub for refugees, given that the state of [[Shu (state)|Shu]] had long been founded and ruled by political and military elites from the Central Plain and north China. Some refugees from the north China might have found residence in south China depending on their social status and military power in the north. The [[Eastern Jin|rump Jin state]] or the [[Southern dynasties]] vied against some elite Chinese from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] and south of the Yangtze River.\n\n===Sui and Tang eras===\nZhejiang, as the heartland of the [[Jiangnan]] (Yangtze River Delta), remained the wealthiest area during the [[Six Dynasties]] (220 or 222\u2013589), Sui, and Tang. After being incorporated into the [[Sui dynasty]], its economic richness was used for the [[Sui dynasty]]'s ambitions to expand north and south, particularly into [[Goguryeo\u2013Sui War|Korea]] and Vietnam. The plan led the [[Sui dynasty]] to restore and expand the network which became the [[Grand Canal of China]]. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the [[Zhe River]] and the shores of [[Hangzhou Bay]]), and from [[Suzhou]], and thence to the [[North China Plain]]. The d\u00e9b\u00e2cle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country. Zhejiang was an important economic center of the empire's [[Jiangnan]] East Circuit and was considered particularly prosperous. Throughout the [[Tang dynasty]], The Grand Canal had remained effective, transporting grains and material resources to [[North China plain]] and metropolitan centers of the empire. As the Tang dynasty disintegrated, Zhejiang constituted most of the territory of the regional kingdom of [[Wuyue]].\n\n===Wuyue era===\n[[File:QIAN_Liu_(aka_TSIEN_Liu),_King_of_Wuyue.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Portrait of [[Qian Liu]], the King of [[Wuyue]].]]\nAfter the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907, the entire area of what is now Zhejiang fell under the control of the kingdom [[Wuyue]] established by King [[Qian Liu]], who selected [[Hangzhou]] (a city in the modern day area of Zhejiang) as his kingdom's capital. Despite being under Wuyue rule for a relatively short period of time, Zhejiang underwent a long period of financial and cultural prosperity which continued even after the kingdom fell.\n\nAfter Wuyue was conquered during the reunification of China, many shrines were erected across the former territories of Wuyue, mainly in Zhejiang, where the kings of Wuyue were memorialised, and sometimes, worshipped as being able to dictate weather and agriculture. Many of these shrines, known as \"Shrine of the Qian King\" or \"Temple to the Qian King,\" still remain today, with the most popularly visited example being that near [[West Lake]] in Hangzhou.\n \nChina's province of Zhejiang during the 940s was also the place of origin of the [[Hu (surname)|H\u00fa]] family (H\u1ed3 in Vietnamese) from which the founder of the [[H\u1ed3 Dynasty]] who ruled Vietnam, Emperor [[H\u1ed3 Qu\u00fd Ly]], came from.<ref name=\"Taylor2013\">{{cite book|author=K.

Under the Song, the prosperity of South China began to overtake that of North China.

Yuan Longquan celadons feature a thinner, greener glaze on larger vessels with decoration and shapes derived from Middle Eastern ceramic and metalwares. These were produced in large quantities for the Chinese export trade to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and (during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]) Europe. By the Ming, however, production was notably deficient in quality.

Zhejiang became part of the much larger [[Jiangzhe province]].\n\nThe [[Ming dynasty]], which drove out the Mongols in 1368, finally established the present day province of Zhejiang with its borders having little changes since this establishment.\n\nAs in other coastal provinces, number of fortresses were constructed along the Zhejiang coast during the early Ming to defend the land against [[wokou|pirate]] incursions. Some of them have been preserved or restored, such as [[Pucheng Township|Pucheng]] in the south of the province ([[Cangnan County]]).\n\n===Qing era===\nUnder the late Ming dynasty and the [[Qing dynasty]] that followed it, Zhejiang's ports were important centers of international trade.\n\n[[File:Dayu Bay - Shitang Cun - P1210531.JPG|thumb|left|A restored Qing era (1891) bridge on a coastal road]]\n\"In 1727 the to-min or 'idle people' of Cheh Kiang province (a [[Ningpo]] name still existing), the yoh-hu or 'music people' of [[Shanxi]] province, the si-min or 'small people' of Kiang Su (Jiangsu) province, and the [[Tanka people]] or 'egg-people' of [[Canton Province|Canton]] (to this day the boat population there), were all freed from their social disabilities, and allowed to count as free men.\"<ref>{{cite book|quote=the lot of both Manchu and Chinese bondsmen. In 1727 the to-min or \"idle people \" of Cheh Kiang province (a Ningpo name still existing), the yoh-hu or \" music people \" of Shan Si province, the si-min or \"small people \" of Kiang Su province, and the tan-ka or \"egg-people\" of Canton (to this day the boat population there), were all freed from their social disabilities, and allowed to count as free men. So far as my own observations go, after residing for a quarter of a century in half the provinces of China, north, south, east, and west, I should be inclined to describe slavery in China as totally invisible to the naked eye ; personal liberty is absolute where feebleness or ignorance do not expose the subject to the rapacity of mandarins, relatives, or speculators. Even savages and foreigners are welcomed as equals, so long as they conform unreservedly to Chinese custom. On the other hand, the oldfashioned social disabilities of policemen, barbers, and playactors still exist in the eyes of the law, though any idea of caste is totally absent therefrom, and \"unofficially\" these individuals are as good as any other free men.  Having now taken a cursory view of Chinese slavery from its historical aspect, let us see what it is in practice. Though the penal code forbids and annuls the sale into slavery of free persons, even by a husband, father, or grandfather, yet the number of free persons who are sold or sell themselves to escape starvation and misery is considerable. It is nominally a punishable offence to keep a free man or lost child as a slave; also for parents to sell their children without the consent of the latter, or to drown their girls; but in practice the law is in both cases ignored, and scarcely ever enforced ; ''a fortiori'' the minor offence of selling children, even with their consent. Indeed, sales of girls for secondary wives is of daily occurrence, and, as we have seen, the Emperors Yung-cheng and K'ien-lung explicitly recognized the right of parents to sell children in times of famine, whilst the missionaries unanimously bear witness to the fact that the public sale of children in the streets\u2014for instance, of Tientsin\u2014was frequently witnessed during recent times of dearth. But slave markets and public sales are unknown in a general way. Occasionally old parents sell their children in order to purchase coffins for themselves.

Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], signed in 1843, Ningbo became one of the five Chinese [[treaty ports]] opened to virtually unrestricted foreign trade.  Much of Zhejiang came under the control of the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] during the [[Taiping Rebellion]], which resulted in a considerable loss of life in the north-western and central parts of the province, sparing the rest of Zhejiang from the disastrous depopulation that occurred. In 1876, [[Wenzhou]] became Zhejiang's second treaty port. [[Jianghuai Mandarin]] speakers later came to settle in these depopulated regions of northern Zhejiang.\n\n=== Republican era===\n\n{{See also|Chekiang Province, Republic of China}}\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], which led into [[World War II]], much of Zhejiang was occupied by Japan and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the [[Reorganized National Government of China]]. Following the [[Doolittle Raid]], most of the B-25 American crews that came down in China eventually made it to safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. The Chinese people who helped them, however, paid dearly for sheltering the Americans. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] began the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign]] to intimidate the Chinese out of helping downed American airmen. The Japanese killed an estimated 250,000 civilians from the area of Hangzhou to [[Nanchang]] and also [[Zhuzhou]] while searching for Doolittle's men.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/perilousfight/ |title=PBS Perilous Flight |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910035849/http://www.pbs.org/perilousfight/ |archive-date=10 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== People's Republica era===\n\nAfter the People's Republic of China took control of [[Mainland China]] in 1949, the [[Republic of China]] government based in [[Taiwan]] continued to control the [[Dachen Islands]] off the coast of Zhejiang until 1955, even establishing a rival Zhejiang provincial government there, creating a situation similar to Fujian province today. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u201376), Zhejiang was in chaos and disunity, and its economy was stagnant, especially during the high tide (1966\u201369) of the revolution. The agricultural policy favoring grain production at the expense of industrial and cash crops intensified economic hardships in the province. Mao's self-reliance policy and the reduction in maritime trade cut off the lifelines of the port cities of Ningbo and Wenzhou. While Mao invested heavily in railroads in interior China, no major railroads were built in South Zhejiang, where transportation remained poor.<ref name=wiley>{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118764017/PDFSTART |title=Regional Inequality in China: A Case Study of Zhejiang Province |doi=10.1111/j.0040-747X.2004.00292.x |date=2004-02-16 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |volume=95 |journal=Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale Geografie |pages=44\u201360|last1=Wei |first1=Yehua Dennis |last2=Ye |first2=Xinyue }}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nZhejiang benefited less from central government investment than some other provinces due to its lack of natural resources, a location vulnerable to potential flooding from the sea, and an economic base at the national average.

The [[Governor of Zhejiang]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Zhejiang. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor is subordinate to the Zhejiang [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the \"Zhejiang [[CPC Party Chief]].\"\n\nSeveral political figures who served as Zhejiang's top political office of Communist Party Secretary have played key roles in various events in PRC history. [[Tan Zhenlin]] (term 1949-1952), the inaugural Party Secretary, was one of the leading voices against Mao's [[Cultural Revolution]] during the so-called [[February Countercurrent]] of 1967. [[Jiang Hua]] (term 1956-1968), was the \"chief justice\" on the Special Court in the case against the [[Gang of Four]] in 1980. Three provincial Party Secretaries since the 1990s have gone onto prominence at the national level. They include CPC General Secretary and President [[Xi Jinping]] (term 2002-2007), [[National People's Congress]] Chairman and former Vice-Premier [[Zhang Dejiang]] (term 1998-2002), and [[Zhao Hongzhu]] (term 2007-2012), the Deputy Secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], China's top anti-corruption body. Of Zhejiang's fourteen Party Secretaries since 1949, none were native to the province.\n\nZhejiang was home to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and many high-ranking officials in the [[Kuomintang]], who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Civil War.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Dayu Bay - YuAo Cun - P1210476.JPG|thumb|Yuao, a fishing village on Dayu Bay in south Zhejiang ([[Cangnan County]])]]\n\nZhejiang is one of the richest and most developed provinces in China. As of 2018, its [[Gross domestic product|nominal GDP]] was [[United States dollar|US$]]849 billion ([[Renminbi|CN\uffe5]] 5.62 trilion), about 6.24% of the country's GDP and ranked [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|4th]] among [[Administrative divisions of China|province-level administrative units]]; the province's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth CN\uffe5196.70 billion (US$29.72 billion), CN\uffe52.3506 trillion (US$355.22 billion), and CN\uffe53.0724 trillion (US$464.29 billion) respectively. Its nominal GDP per capita was US$14,907 (CN\uffe598,643) and ranked the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|5th]] in the country. The private sector in the province has been playing an increasingly important role in boosting the regional economy since [[Chinese economic reform|Economic Reform]] in 1978.<ref name=\"SNA2008\"/>\n\nZhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, [[textiles]], chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \"Zhejiang model,\" which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into [[infrastructure]], and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.<ref name=\"thechinaperspective.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/zhejiang-province/ |title=China Economy @ China Perspective |publisher=Thechinaperspective.com |date=2013-09-06 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045925/http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/zhejiang-province/ |archive-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou.<ref name=wiley/> The [[Per-Capita Disposable Income|per capita disposable income]] of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 55,574 yuan (US$8,398) in 2018, an annual real growth of 8.4%.

North Zhejiang, known as the \"Land of Fish and Rice,\" is characterized by its canals and waterways.]]\n\n===Languages===\nZhejiang is mountainous and has therefore fostered the development of many distinct local cultures. Linguistically speaking, Zhejiang is extremely diverse. Most inhabitants of Zhejiang speak [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], but the Wu dialects are very diverse, especially in the south, where one valley may speak a dialect completely unintelligible to the next valley a few kilometers away. Other [[varieties of Chinese]] are spoken as well, mostly along the borders; [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] dialects are spoken on the border with Anhui, while [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects are spoken on the border with Fujian. (See [[Hangzhou dialect]], [[Shaoxing dialect]], [[Ningbo dialect]], [[Wenzhou dialect]], [[Taizhou dialect]], [[Jinhua dialect]], and [[Quzhou dialect]] for more information).\n\nThroughout history there have been a series of ''[[lingua franca]]s'' in the area to allow for better communication. The dialects spoken in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo have taken on this role historically. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], which is not mutually intelligible with any of the local dialects, has been promoted as the standard language of communication throughout China. As a result, most of the population now can, to some degree, speak and comprehend Mandarin and can [[Code-switching|code-switch]] when necessary. A majority of the population educated since 1978 can speak Mandarin. Urban residents tend to be more fluent in Mandarin than rural people. Nevertheless, a Zhejiang accent is detectable in almost everyone from the area communicating in Mandarin, and the home dialect remains an important part of the everyday lives and cultural identities of most Zhejiang residents.\n\n===Music===\nZhejiang is the home of [[Yue opera]], one of the most prominent forms of [[Chinese opera]]. ''Yueju'' originated in [[Shengzhou]] and is traditionally performed by actresses only, in both male and female roles. Other important opera traditions include Yongju (of Ningbo), [[Shao opera]] (of [[Shaoxing]]), [[Ouju]] (of Wenzhou), [[Wuju]] (of [[Jinhua]]), Taizhou Luantan (of Taizhou) and Zhuji Luantan (of [[Zhuji]]).\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Cangnan - Pacao - P1210261.JPG|thumb|Fish being dried dockside in Pacao Harbor, [[Cangnan County]]]]\nLongjing tea (also called dragon well tea), originating in Hangzhou, is one of the most prestigious, if not ''the'' most prestigious Chinese tea. Hangzhou is also renowned for its silk umbrellas and hand fans. [[Zhejiang cuisine]] (itself subdivided into many traditions, including Hangzhou cuisine) is one of the eight great traditions of [[Chinese cuisine]].\n\n===Place names===\nSince ancient times, north Zhejiang and neighbouring south Jiangsu have been famed for their prosperity and opulence{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}, and simply inserting north Zhejiang place names (Hangzhou, Jiaxing, etc.) into poetry gave an effect of dreaminess, a practice followed by many noted poets.

However, some employees' unions conducted their negotiations within mutually agreed limits above this limit with employers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/28/newsid_2531000/2531007.stm  On This Day: 1979: Early election as Callaghan defeated], [[BBC]].

Public sector employee strike actions included an unofficial strike by [[gravedigger]]s working in [[Liverpool]] and [[Tameside]], and strikes by refuse collectors.

Crosland had argued in his book ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' that the government exerted enough control over private industry that it was not necessary to [[nationalisation|nationalise]] it as [[Clause IV|the party had long called to do]], and that the ultimate goals of [[socialism]] could be as readily achieved by assuring long-term economic stability and building out the social [[welfare state]]. His \"[[The Future of Socialism#Labour revisionism|revisionist]]\" views became Labour's perspective on the [[post-war consensus]], in which both they and the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]] agreed in principle on a strong government role in the economy, strong unions and a welfare state as foundational to Britain's prosperity.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\">{{cite book |last=L\u00f3pez |first=Tara Martin |title=The Winter of Discontent: Myth, Memory and History |date=2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9781781386019 |pages=40\u201345}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, following the surge in radical left-wing politics of the late 1960s, that view was challenged in another Labour figure's book, [[Stuart Holland]]'s ''The Socialist Challenge''. He argued that contrary to Crosland's assertions, the government could exercise little control over Britain's largest companies, which were likely to continue consolidating into an [[oligopoly]] that, by the 1980s, could raise prices high enough that governments following [[Keynesian economics]] would be unable to ensure their citizens the opportunity for [[full employment]] that they had been able to since the war, and exploit [[transfer pricing]] to avoid paying British taxes. Holland called for  returning to nationalisation, arguing that taking control of the top 25 companies that way would result in a market with more competition and less inflation.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nHolland's ideas formed the basis of the [[Alternative Economic Strategy]] (AES) promoted by [[Tony Benn]], then [[Secretary of State for Industry]] in the Labour governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] as they considered responses to [[Pound sterling#1976 sterling crisis|the sterling crisis]] in 1976. The AES called on Britain to adopt a [[protectionism|protectionist]] stance in international trade, including reversing [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|its recent decision to join the European Common Market]], and impose no incomes policy to combat inflation. Benn believed that this approach was more in keeping with Labour's traditional policies and would have its strongest supporters in the unions and outside of them vigorously supporting the government against opposition from the financial sector and commanding heights of industry. It was ultimately rejected in favor of the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]] and extensive cuts in public spending as the condition of an [[International Monetary Fund]] loan that supported the pound.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nThe left wing of the Labour Party, while critical of the revisionist approach and the Social Contract, was not universally supportive of the AES either. Many thought it did not go far enough, or avoided the issue of nationalisation. [[Feminism in the United Kingdom|Feminists]] in particular criticised it for its focus on traditionally male-dominated manufacturing jobs and ignoring the broader issues that the increasing amount of women in the workforce faced, preferring a focus on broader social issues rather than just working conditions and pay, the traditional areas unions had negotiated with employers.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\n===1960s\u201370s labour law reforms===\n\nIn 1968 Wilson's government appointed the [[Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations|Donovan Commission]] to review [[United Kingdom labour law|British labour law]] with an eye toward reducing the days lost to strikes every year; many Britons had come to believe the unions were too powerful despite the country's economic growth since the war. It found much of the problem to lie in a parallel system of 'official' signed agreements between unions and employers, and [[Side letter|'unofficial', often unwritten ones]] at the local level, between [[shop steward]]s and managers, which often took precedence in practice over the official ones. The government responded with ''[[In Place of Strife]]'' a [[white paper]] by [[Secretary of State for Employment]] [[Barbara Castle]], which recommended restrictions on unions' ability to strike, such as requiring strikes take place after a member vote and fining unions for unofficial strikes.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 36\">L\u00f3pez, 36</ref>\n\nThe [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) vigorously opposed making Castle's recommendations law, and Callaghan, then [[Home Secretary]], led a cabinet revolt which led to its abandonment. Callaghan did not believe it would be effective in curtailing unofficial strikes, that the proposals could not pass, and the effort would create unnecessary tension between the government and the unions that were key to its political strength.<ref name=\"Lopez 37\">{{cite book|last=Callaghan|first=James|authorlink=James Callaghan|title=Time and Chance|page=274|date=1987|publisher=Collins|isbn=9780002165150}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, 37</ref>\n\nAfter the Conservatives won [[1970 United Kingdom general election|the following year's election]], they implemented their own legislation to address the issue. The [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]], modeled in part on the U.S. [[Taft-Hartley Act]], passed over determined union opposition, included many of the same provisions as ''In Place of Strife'', and explicitly stated that formal [[collective bargaining agreement]]s would have the force of law unless they had [[disclaimer]]s to the contrary. It also created a [[National Industrial Relations Court]] to handle disputes and put unions under a central registry to enforce their rules.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 38\">L\u00f3pez, 38</ref>\n\nNew Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] hoped that the new law would not only address the strike issue but the steep [[inflation]] plaguing the British economy (along with other industrial capitalist economies) at the time, eliminating the need for a separate [[incomes policy]] by having a moderating effect on pay increases demanded by unions. Ongoing union resistance to the Industrial Relations Act led to a [[House of Lords]] ruling in their favor over demonstrations and widespread unofficial strikes following the [[Pentonville Five]]'s imprisonment for continuing to picket a London container depot in violation of a court order, which undermined the legislation. Coal miners [[UK miners' strike (1972)|officially went on strike]] for the first time in almost half a century in 1972; after two months the strike was settled with the miners getting a 21 per cent increase, less than half of what they had originally sought.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\">L\u00f3pez, 39</ref>\n\nHeath as a result turned to an incomes policy; inflation continued to worsen. Its implementation was abandoned in 1973 when [[1973 oil shock|that year's oil embargo]] nearly doubled prices within months. To meet demand for heat in the wintertime, the government had to return to coal, giving the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] more leverage. The government declared a [[state of emergency]] that November, and at the beginning of 1974 limited all nonessential businesses to [[Three-Day Week|three days of electricity each week]] to conserve power. Miners, who had seen their rise from two years before turn into a pay cut in real terms due to the inflation the government had not brought under control, voted overwhelmingly to go on strike in late January.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" />\n\nTwo weeks later, the government responded by calling [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|an election]], running on the slogan \"Who Governs Britain?\". At the end of the month the Conservatives no longer did; Labour and Wilson returned, but [[hung parliament|without a majority]]. They were able to pass the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]], which repealed the Heath government's Industrial Relations Act.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" /> \n\nIn [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October]] they won a majority of three seats; still they needed a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal Party]] to have a majority on many issues. Callaghan, now [[Foreign Secretary]], warned his fellow Cabinet members at the time of the possibility of \"a breakdown of democracy\", telling them that \"If I were a young man, I would emigrate.\"<ref name=\"beckett2010\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NURERF4hb8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA175#v=onepage&f=false | title=When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies | publisher=Faber & Faber | author=Beckett, Andy | year=2010 | pages=175 | isbn=978-0-571-22137-0}}</ref>\n\n===Incomes policy===\n\nWilson, and Callaghan, who succeeded him as Prime Minister after Wilson resigned for health reasons in 1976, continued to fight inflation, which peaked at 26.9 per cent in the 12 months to August 1975. While demonstrating to markets [[fiscal responsibility]] the government wished to avoid large increases in unemployment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Colin Hay |title=Chronicles of a Death Foretold: the Winter of Discontent and Construction of the Crisis of British Keynesianism |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |year=2010 |volume=63 |pages=446\u201370 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsp056 |issue=3}}</ref> As part of the campaign to bring down inflation, the government had agreed a \"[[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]]\" with the TUC which allowed for a voluntary [[incomes policy]] in which the pay rises for workers were held down to limits set by the government. Previous governments had brought in incomes policies backed by [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], but the social contract agreed that this would not happen.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n====Phases I and II====\nPhase I of the pay policy was announced on 11 July 1975 with a [[white paper]] entitled ''The Attack on Inflation''. This proposed a limit on wage rises of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]6 per week for all earning below \u00a38,500 annually.  The [[TUC General Council]] had accepted these proposals by 19 votes to 13. On 5 May 1976 the TUC accepted a new policy for 1976 increases, beginning 1 August, of between \u00a32.50 and \u00a34 per week with further years outlined.  At the Annual Congress on 8 September 1976 the TUC rejected a motion which called for a return to free [[collective bargaining]] (which meant no incomes policy at all) once Phase I expired on 1 August 1977. This new policy was Phase II of the incomes policy.<ref name=hay> Hay, \"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\"</ref>\n\n====Phase III====\nOn 15 July 1977, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] announced Phase III of the incomes policy in which there was to be a phased return to free collective bargaining, without \"a free-for-all\".  After prolonged negotiations, the TUC agreed to continue with the modest increases recommended for 1977\u201378 under Phase II limits and not to try to reopen pay agreements made under the previous policy, while the Government agreed not to intervene in pay negotiations. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] criticised the power of the unions and lack of any stronger policy to cover the period from the summer of 1978. The inflation rate continued to fall through 1977 and by 1978 the annual rate fell below 10 per cent.<ref name=hay/>\n\nAt the end of the year [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Bernard Donoughue]], Callaghan's chief policy advisor, sent him a memo analysing possible election dates. He concluded that the following October or November would be the best option, as the economy was likely to remain in good shape through then.

Most told him that it would be difficult, but not impossible. [[Geoffrey Goodman]] disagreed, saying in his view it would be impossible for the union leaders to keep their membership from demanding higher pay increases. \"If that is the case, then I will go over the heads of the trade union leadership and appeal directly to their members\u2014and the voters\", the prime minister responded. \"We have to hold the line on pay or else the government will fall.\"<ref name=\"Goodman 220\u201321\">{{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Geoffrey |authorlink1=Geoffrey Goodman |title=From Bevan to Blair: Fifty Years Reporting from the Political Frontline |date=2003 |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=9780745321783 |pages=220\u201321 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqlZAAAAMAAJ}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nHaving prepared for the imminent end of the [[incomes policy]], global inflation supervened and was coming towards [[Interest rate#Historical interest rates|record levels during the 1978\u201382 period]].{{refn|And therefore a second trigger for a rise in [[inflation]]|group= n}} On 21 July 1978 [[Denis Healey]] introduced a new White Paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5 per cent in the year from 1 August. Callaghan was determined to keep inflation down to single figures, however trade union leaders warned the government that the 5 per cent limit was unachievable, and urged a more flexible approach with a range of settlements between 5 and 8 per cent. [[Terry Duffy]] president of the AUEW described the limit as 'political suicide'. Denis Healey also privately expressed scepticism about the achievability of the limit. The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to [[collective bargaining|free collective bargaining]] as they were promised.<ref name=\"Conroy\">{{cite book |last1=Conroy |first1=Harry |title=Callaghan |date=2006 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=1-904950-70-1 |pages=109-124}}</ref><ref name=hay/> \n\nIt had been widely expected that Callaghan would call a general election in the autumn of 1978, and that the 5 per cent limit would be revised if Labour won. At a private dinner before that year's TUC conference, Callaghan discussed election strategy with the leaders of major unions. He asked whether he should call an autumn election; with the exception of Scanlon they all urged him to call for one no later than November. Any later, they said, and they could not guarantee their memberships would remain on the job and off the picket line through the winter.<ref name=\"Goodman 226\u201327\">Goodman, 226\u201327, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly however on 7 September, Callaghan announced that he would not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued pay restraint so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election, therefore the 5 per cent limit stood. The pay limit was officially termed \"Phase IV\" but most referred to it as \"the 5 per cent limit\". Although the government did not make the 5 per cent limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.<ref name=hay/><ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=A.J. |title=To Build a New Jerusalem |date=1996 |isbn=0-349-10809-9 |pages=363-368}}</ref>\n\n===Changes in labour movement===\n\nBetween 1966 and 1979, Britain's unions were changing and becoming more diverse. Most of the increase in union membership was driven by women returning to or entering the workforce\u201473 per cent of them joined a union during that period against 19.3 per cent of men newly in work, as manufacturing jobs, traditionally heavily male, disappeared. Black and Asian workers also filled union ranks; in 1977 61 per cent of black men in work belonged to a union as opposed to 47 per cent of white men.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA32 32\u201333]</ref> Asian women became the face of the labour movement during the 1976\u201378 [[Grunwick dispute]] over pay and conditions at a film processing plant in suburban London.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 57\u201359]</ref>\n\nWithin unions, power was also devolving to the rank and file. The political upheavals of the late 1960s in Europe and the United States had brought [[participatory democracy]] to the fore, and workers felt [[Industrial democracy|they should be taking decisions]], including about when and whether to strike, that had hitherto been the province of union leadership. [[Hugh Scanlon]], who took over as head of the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union|Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers]] (AUEW) in 1967, and [[Jack Jones (trade unionist)|Jack Jones]], general secretary of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] (TGWU) from shortly afterward, were known among union leaders as \"the dubious duo\" for their advocacy for devolution.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" />\n\n====Dissatisfied public employees====\n\nMany new members were also coming from government jobs. In 1974, about half of the total British workforce was unionised, but 83.1 per cent of all public-sector workers were. In the health sector that reached 90 per cent. Many of the government workers joining unions were women.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" /> \n\nThe public employees were in a particularly difficult position with regard to incomes policy. Governments kept their employees' pay, already lower than their private-sector colleagues, low both because they could and because they wanted to set an example for the private sector, an example the private sector rarely followed. Their unions were also frustrated that their growing numbers had not yet translated into corresponding influence within the TUC.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 111\">L\u00f3pez, 111</ref>\n\nThese matters came to a head with the 1977 fire brigadiers' strike, a strike that many brigadiers were conflicted about since they knew they would be abandoning their own profession's duty to protect life, but felt that they could no longer make ends meet with their pay packets. They asked a 30 per cent increase, 20 per cent over the government's limit at the time, and a limit to 42 hours of work each week. The government responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]] and bringing in Army troops as replacements. The TUC voted late in the strike to not campaign in support of the brigadiers, in order to maintain its relationship with the government.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\" />\n\n===\"Stepping Stones\" and hardening of Conservative position on unionism===\n\n[[Margaret Thatcher]] was elected [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative leader]] to succeed Heath in 1975. She had been known as a member of his Cabinet, where she served as [[Secretary of State for Education]], for her advocacy of market-based solutions over government intervention in the economy, and had become convinced, as she wrote later, by that experience that the only thing more damaging to the British economy than Labour's socialist policies was her own party's attempts to emulate them. Influenced by writers such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Colm Brogan]], she came to believe the power of British unions under the [[postwar consensus]] had come at the expense of Britain as a whole.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\">L\u00f3pez, 55\u201357</ref>\n\nIn 1977 two of her advisors, [[John Hoskyns]] and Norman Strauss, prepared a report called \"[[John Hoskyns#The Stepping Stones Report, 1977|Stepping Stones]]\" which diagrammed the [[vicious cycle]] through which they believed the unions' influence exacerbated Britain's ongoing economic difficulties, such as [[unemployment in the United Kingdom|unemployment]] and inflation. Thatcher made it available to her [[Shadow Cabinet of Margaret Thatcher|shadow cabinet]] with the authors' recommendation that they all read it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hoskyns|first1=John|authorlink1=John Hoskyns|last2=Strauss|first2=Norman|title=Stepping Stones|url=https://c59574e9047e61130f13-3f71d0fe2b653c4f00f32175760e96e7.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/5B6518B5823043FE9D7C54846CC7FE31.pdf|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date=14 November 1977|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> By the end of the year she had formed a steering group to develop a specific policy aimed at curbing union power under a Tory government, and a media strategy that would invest the public in this.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\" />\n\nTo implement the media strategy, the party hired the advertising firm of [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], whose 1978 \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign has been credited with persuading Callaghan not to hold an election that year.{{efn|Like his counterpart Donoughue, Hoskyns had concluded that the optimal time for an election for Labour was earlier, in the spring of 1978, with autumn being still slightly favorable, but the economic prospects unclear after that. He also preferred a later election as it would give the party the time necessary to make its case for a radical change in Britain's relations with its unions.<ref>Hoskyns, 45</ref>}} In 1978 Britain's largest tabloid, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', dropped its longtime support for Labour to instead embrace the Tories. Editor [[Larry Lamb (newspaper editor)|Larry Lamb]] met frequently with Thatcher's media advisor [[Gordon Reece]] to plan and refine strategy.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 18\">L\u00f3pez, 18</ref> During the later phases of the Grunwick dispute, as strikers took to the streets to march and sometimes clashed violently with the police, the Tories began using the media coverage to leverage \"Stepping Stones\"' critique of unionism.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 58\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, 58\u201359</ref>\n\n==Ford negotiations==\n\nAlthough not an official guideline, the pay rise set by [[Ford of Britain]] was accepted throughout private industry as a benchmark for negotiations.  Ford had enjoyed a good year, and could afford to offer a large pay rise to its workers.  The company was, however, also a major government contractor.  Ford's management therefore made a pay offer within the 5 per cent guidelines. In response, 15,000 Ford workers, mostly from the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] (TGWU), began an unofficial strike on 22 September 1978, which subsequently became an official TGWU action on 5 October.  The number of participants grew to 57,000.\n\nDuring the strike, [[Vauxhall Motors]] employees accepted an 8.5 per cent rise.  After long negotiation in which they weighed the chances of suffering from government sanctions against the continued damage of the strike, Ford eventually revised their offer to 17 per cent and decided to accept the sanctions; Ford workers accepted the rise on 22 November.\n\n==Political difficulties==\nAs the Ford strike was starting, the Labour Party conference began at [[Blackpool]]. Terry Duffy, the delegate from [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] Constituency Labour Party and a supporter of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group, moved a motion on 2 October which demanded \"that the Government immediately cease intervening in wage negotiations\". Despite a plea from [[Michael Foot]] not to put the motion to the vote, the resolution was carried by 4,017,000 to 1,924,000. The next day, the Prime Minister accepted the fact of defeat by saying \"I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday\", but insisted that he would not let up on the fight against inflation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Labour Party|title=Report of the Annual Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjCNAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Labour Representation Committee|page=235}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the government's situation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was increasingly difficult; through by-elections it had lost its majority of three seats in 1976 and had been forced to put together a [[Lab-Lib pact#1977|pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1977 in order to keep winning votes on legislation; the pact lapsed in July 1978.  A decision to grant extra parliamentary seats to [[Northern Ireland]] afforded temporary support from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], but the Unionists were clear that this support would be withdrawn immediately after the Bill to grant extra seats had been passed &ndash; it was through the Ulster Unionists agreeing to abstain that the government defeated a [[motion of no confidence]] by 312 to 300 on 9 November.<ref name=hay/>\n\n===Further negotiation at the TUC===\nBy the middle of November it was clear that Ford would offer an increase substantially over the 5 per cent limit. The government subsequently entered into intense negotiations with the TUC, hoping to produce an agreement on pay policy that would prevent disputes and show political unity in the run-up to the general election. A limited and weak formula was eventually worked out and put to the General Council of the TUC on 14 November, but its General Council vote was tied 14\u201314, with the formula being rejected on the chair's casting vote. One important personality on the TUC General Council had changed earlier in 1978 with [[Moss Evans]] replacing [[Jack Jones (trade union leader)|Jack Jones]] at the TGWU. Evans proved a weak leader of his union, although it is doubtful whether Jones could have restrained the actions of some of the TGWU shop stewards.\n\nAfter Ford settled, the government announced on 28 November that sanctions{{clarify|date=August 2013}} would be imposed on Ford, along with 220 other companies, for breach of the pay policy. The announcement of actual sanctions produced an immediate protest from the [[Confederation of British Industry]] which announced that it would challenge their legality. The Conservatives put down a motion in the House of Commons to revoke the sanctions. A co-ordinated protest by left-wing Labour MPs over spending on defence forced the debate set for 7 December to be postponed; however on 13 December an anti-sanctions amendment was passed by 285 to 279. The substantive motion as amended was then passed by 285 to 283. James Callaghan put down a further motion of confidence for the next day, which the government won by ten votes (300 to 290), but accepted that his government could not use sanctions. In effect this deprived the government of any means of enforcing the 5 per cent limit on private industry.\n\n==Onset of severe winter weather==\n\nA mild autumn turned cold on the morning of 25 November when temperatures recorded at [[Heathrow Airport]] dropped from {{convert|14|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|0|\u00b0C}} overnight, with some snowflakes. Throughout most of the following month, the cold lingered, only for temperatures to rise well above {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} around Christmas. On 30 December, the temperature dropped again, along with rain that soon turned to snow; the next day 1978 ended with Heathrow recording a high of only {{convert|-3|\u00b0C}} amid steady snowfall.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\">{{cite book |last1=Nobbs |first1=Patrick |title=The Story of the British and Their Weather: From Frost Fairs to Indian Summers |date=2015 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Ltd. |isbn=9781445644615 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUp4BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT92&lpg=PT9 |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |chapter=9; The Winter of Discontent 1978\u201379}}</ref>\n\nThe effects were more severe outside of London. [[Ilfracombe]] and other towns in [[North Devon]] could only be reached by helicopter as many roads could not be adequately cleared. The [[Royal Automobile Club]] blamed local councils, who in turn pointed to unresolved issues with their unions and staff shortages; even around London local authorities were only able to clear main roads. Two Scottish trains near [[Stirling]] were stuck in the snow, leaving 300 passengers stranded; rail transport difficulties were exacerbated elsewhere in the country by a strike. Tanker drivers had also gone on strike in some areas from 18 December, causing some homeowners to have difficulties keeping their homes heated and limiting petrol supplies. Only three [[English Football League|League]] football matches could take place over the [[New Year's Day|New Year's]] holiday, and all rugby contests were canceled. Three men drowned after falling through the ice on the [[Hampstead Heath]] pond in London.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\" />\n\n==Lorry drivers' strike==\nWith the government now having no way of enforcing its pay policy, unions which had not yet put in pay claims began to increase their aim. [[truck|Lorry]] drivers, represented by the TGWU, had demanded rises of up to 40 per cent on 18 December; years of expansion in the industry had left employers short of drivers, and those drivers who had jobs often worked 70\u201380 hours a week for minimal pay.<ref>L\u00f3pez, 90</ref> The [[Road Haulage Association]] (RHA), the industry trade group, had initially told [[Secretary of State for Transport]] [[Bill Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|William Rodgers]], a member of the Labour Party's right wing who had become sceptical of the public's appetite for the completion of the party's socialist programme, that it would stay within the 5 per cent ceiling. But as 1979 began, the RHA, whom Rodgers saw as disorganised and easily intimidated by the TGWU, suddenly increased its offer to 13 per cent, in hopes of settling before strikes became widespread.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rodgers|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|title=Fourth Among Equals|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fourth_Among_Equals/0L0hAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0|page=181|publisher=Politico's|date=2000}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, 92</ref>\n\nThe offer had the opposite effect. Drivers, emboldened by memories of a strike the previous winter by South Wales hauliers that won participants a 20 per cent rise, decided they could do better by walking out. The union's national leadership was, as they had anticipated in their September dinner with Callaghan, doubtful they could restrain the local leaders. On 2 January Rodgers warned the Cabinet that a national road-haulage strike was about to happen, but cautioned against pressuring the RHA to improve their offer even more.<ref>Rodgers, 180, cited at L\u00f3pez, 93</ref>\n\nThe next day an unofficial strike of all TGWU lorry drivers began. With petrol distribution held up, petrol stations closed across the country. The strikers also [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] the main ports. The strikes were made official on 11 January by the TGWU and 12 January by the United Road Transport Union. With 80 per cent of the nation's goods transported by road, roads still not completely cleared from the earlier storm, essential supplies were put in danger as striking drivers picketed those firms that continued to work. While the oil tanker drivers were working, the main refineries were also targeted and the tanker drivers let the strikers know where they were going, allowing for flying pickets to turn them back at their destination. More than a million UK workers were laid off temporarily during the disputes.\n\nIn [[Kingston upon Hull]], striking hauliers were able to blockade the city's two main roads effectively enough to control what goods were allowed into and out of the city, and companies made their case to their own nominal employees to get past the barricades. Newspaper headlines likened the situation to a siege, and the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]; fears that food supplies would also be impacted fueled [[panic buying]]. Such coverage often exaggerated the reach of the strikers, which served both their interest and their employers'.<ref>L\u00f3pez, 94</ref> It also helped the Conservatives disseminate \"Stepping Stones\"' arguments about unionism out of control to the public; letters to the editor across the country reflected a growing public anger with the unions.<ref>L\u00f3pez, 107</ref>\n\nDue to the disruption of fuel supplies, the [[Cabinet Office]] prepared to implement previous plans for \"Operation Drumstick\", by which the [[British Army|Army]] were put on standby to take over from the tanker drivers. However, the operation would need the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] in order to allow conscription of the assets of the oil companies, and the government drew back from such a step. Before the situation developed into a crisis the oil companies settled on wage rises of around 15 per cent.\n\nA further plan was drawn up to call a state of emergency and safeguard essential supplies through the Army, regarding which the government warned the TGWU leadership, which resulted in the union accepting (12 January 1979) a list of emergency supplies which were officially exempt from action. In practice, what counted as an emergency was left up to local officials of the TGWU to determine, and practice across the country varied according to the views of the local shop stewards who established \"dispensation committees\" to decide. When strikers in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] did not allow the correct mix of animal feed through to local farms, the farmers dropped the bodies of dead piglets and chickens outside the union offices; the union contended that the farmers had actually wrung the chicken's necks to kill them, and the piglets had been killed when the sow rolled over and crushed them.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 29 January, lorry drivers in the South West accepted a deal awarded by an [[arbitration|arbitration panel]] of a rise of up to 20 per cent, just \u00a31 per week less than the union had been striking for; this settlement proved a model which was accepted throughout the country.\n\n==\"Crisis? What crisis?\"==\nOn 10 January, [[James Callaghan]] arrived back from a [[Guadeloupe Conference|summit in Guadeloupe]] in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. Having been tipped off that the press were present, his press secretary Tom McCaffrey advised him to say nothing and return immediately to work, but his political adviser [[Thomas McNally, Baron McNally|Tom McNally]] thought that the image of Callaghan returning and declaring his intent to take control of the situation would be reassuring. Callaghan therefore decided to give a press conference at [[Heathrow Airport]]. To McNally's dismay Callaghan was jocular and referred to having had a swim in the Caribbean during the summit. He was then asked (by a reporter from the ''[[Evening Standard]]'') \"What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?\" and replied:\n\n{{Quote|Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.}}\n\nThe next day's edition of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' featured the famous headline \"Crisis? What crisis?\" with a subheading \"Rail, lorry, jobs chaos \u2013 and Jim blames Press\", condemning Callaghan as being \"out of touch\" with British society.<ref name=bbc>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml BBC News \u2013 History of the Winter of Discontent]</ref>\n\n==Public sector employees==\n22 January 1979 was the biggest individual day of strike action since the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] of 1926, and many workers stayed out indefinitely afterwards.  With many in the private sector having achieved substantial rises, the public sector unions became increasingly concerned to keep pace in terms of pay. The government had already announced a slight weakening of the policy on 16 January, which gave the unions cause for hope that they might win and use free collective bargaining. Train drivers belonging to [[ASLEF]] and the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] had already begun a series of 24-hour strikes, and the [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference on 18 January decided to ask that the pay of nurses be increased to the same level in real terms as 1974, which would mean a 25 per cent average rise.  The public sector unions labelled the date the \"Day of Action\", in which they held a 24-hour strike and marched to demand a \u00a360 per week minimum wage.\n\nWith the succession of strikes having been called and then won, many groups of workers began to take unofficial action \u2013 often without the consent or support of the union leaderships. Ambulance drivers began to take strike action in mid-January, and in parts of the country (London, West Midlands, [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland) their action included refusing to attend 999 emergency calls. In these areas, the Army was drafted in to provide a skeleton service. Ancillary hospital staff also went on strike.<ref name=bbc/> On 30 January, the [[Secretary of State for Social Services]] [[David Ennals]] announced that 1,100 of 2,300 [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals were only treating emergencies, that practically no ambulance service was operating normally, and that the ancillary health service workers were deciding which cases merited treatment. The media reported with scorn that [[cancer]] patients were being prevented from getting essential treatment.\n\n===Gravediggers' strike===\nA notorious industrial action during the winter, and one which was later frequently referred to by Conservative politicians, was the strike by gravediggers, members of the [[GMWU]] in [[Liverpool]] and in [[Tameside]] near [[Manchester]].<ref>Moore (2014), p. 399.</ref> Eighty gravediggers being on strike, [[Liverpool City Council]] hired a factory in [[Speke]] to store the corpses until they could be buried. The Department of Environment noted that there were 150 bodies stored at the factory at one point, with 25 more added every day. The reports of unburied bodies caused concern with the public.<ref name=\"Travis\">{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Alan|title=National archives: Fear of fights at cemetery gates during 1979 winter of discontent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/liverpool-gravedigger-strikes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 December 2009}}</ref> On 1 February a persistent journalist asked the Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Bolton, what would be done if the strike continued for months, Bolton speculated that [[burial at sea]] would be considered. Although his response was hypothetical, in the circumstances it caused great alarm. Other alternatives were considered, including allowing the bereaved to dig their own funeral's graves, deploying troops, and engaging private contractors to inter the bodies.  The main concerns were said to be aesthetic because bodies could be safely stored in heat-sealed bags for up to six weeks.<ref name=\"Travis\"/> Bolton later reported being \"horrified\" by the sensationalised reportage of the strike in the mass media.<ref>James Thomas, '\"Bound by History\": The Winter of Discontent in British Politics 1979\u20132004', ''Media, Culture and Society'', 29 (2007), p. 270.</ref> The gravediggers eventually settled for a 14 per cent rise after a fortnight's strike.\n\n===Waste collectors===\nWith many collectors having been on strike since 22 January, local authorities began to run out of space for storing waste and used local parks under their control. The Conservative controlled [[Westminster City Council]] used [[Leicester Square]] in the heart of London's West End for piles of rubbish and, as the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' reported, this attracted [[rat]]s.\n\nOn 21 February, a settlement of the local authority workers' dispute was agreed, whereby workers got an 11 per cent rise, plus \u00a31 per week, with the possibility of extra rises, should a pay comparability study recommend them. Some left-wing local authorities, among them the [[London Borough of Camden]], conceded the union demands in full (known as the \"Camden surplus\") and then saw an investigation by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|District Auditor]], which eventually ruled it a breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]]{{refn|Owed to the payers, the ratepayers of the area|group= n}} and therefore illegal. Camden Borough councillors, among them [[Ken Livingstone]], avoided [[Surcharge (sanction on public servant)|surcharge]]. Livingstone was Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] at the time the decision not to impose a surcharge was made.\n\n==End of the strikes==\nStrikes by essential services dismayed many senior ministers in the Labour government who had been close to the trade union movement, who had thought it unlikely that trade unionists would take such action. Among these was Prime Minister James Callaghan himself, who had built his political career on his connection to the trade unions, and had practically founded one, the [[Inland Revenue Staff Federation]]. Callaghan called the actions of the strikers \"free collective vandalism\".<ref>{{cite web |title=CALLAGHAN DEPICTS STRIKERS AS VANDALS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/callaghan-depicts-strikers-as-vandals-britons-woes-mount-as-workers.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=30 November 2019 |date=2 February 1979}}</ref><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe government was negotiating with the senior union leaders and on 11 February came to agreement on a proposal to be put to the TUC General Council. On 14 February the General Council agreed the concordat, published under the title \"The Economy, the Government, and Trade Union Responsibilities\".{{refn|The significance of a comprehensive agreement on [[Valentine's Day]] was remarked upon by the press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}|group= n}} By this stage union executives had limited control over their members and strikes did not immediately cease, although they began to wind down from this point. In total in 1979, 29,474,000 working days were lost in industrial disputes, compared with 9,306,000 in 1978.\n\n==Political fallout==\nIn the summer before the Winter of Discontent, the minority Labour government's fortunes in the opinion polls had been improving and suggested that they could gain an overall majority in the event of a general election being held. However, on 7 September 1978, Callaghan announced that no general election would be held that year. Callaghan's failure to call an election would ultimately prove to be a costly mistake for his government.<ref name=calruns>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm |work=BBC News | title=1978: Callaghan accused of running scared | date=7 September 1978}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]], who won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and became Prime Minister]]\nThe strikes appeared to have a profound effect on voting intention. According to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], Labour had a lead of 5 percentage points over the Conservatives in November 1978, which turned to a Conservative lead of 7.5 percentage points in January 1979, and of 20 percentage points in February. On 1 March, referendums on [[devolution]] to Scotland and Wales were held. That in Wales went strongly against devolution; that in Scotland produced a small majority in favour which did not reach the threshold set by Parliament of 40 per cent of that electorate. The government's decision not to press ahead with devolution immediately led the [[Scottish National Party]] to withdraw support from the government and on 28 March in a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|motion of no confidence the government lost by one vote]], precipitating a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]].\n\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] had already outlined her proposals for restricting trade union power in a [[party political broadcast]] on 17 January in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. During the election campaign the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] made extensive use of the disruption caused during the strike. One broadcast on 23 April began with the Sun's headline \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" being shown and read out by an increasingly desperate voiceover interspersed with film footage of piles of rubbish, closed factories, picketed hospitals and locked graveyards. The scale of the Conservatives' victory in the general election has often been ascribed to the effect of the strikes, as well as their \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign, and the party used film of the events of the winter in election campaigns for years to come.\n\nFollowing Thatcher's election win, she brought the [[post-war consensus]] to a halt and made drastic changes to trade union laws (most notably the regulation that unions had to hold a ballot among members before calling strikes) and as a result strikes were at their lowest level for 30 years by the time of the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], which the Conservatives won by a landslide.<ref name=\"83electionyoutube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7noHkLaZ5VI|title=Conservative Party Election Broadcast (1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Organized labour|United Kingdom}}\n* [[Strike wave of 1945\u201346]], in U.S., followed by election of conservative Republican majorities in Congress who also passed laws restricting union activities\n* [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[1979 Chicago blizzard]], where the city's inability to clear streets and ensure functioning public transit for weeks afterwards cost the incumbent mayor the primary election.\n* [[February 1969 nor'easter]], winter storm where dysfunctional snow removal afterwards cost New York City mayor [[John Lindsay]] his party's nomination, although he ultimately won re-election later that year\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Beckett, Andy.

Public sector employee strike actions included an unofficial strike by [[gravedigger]]s working in [[Liverpool]] and [[Tameside]], and strikes by refuse collectors.

Crosland had argued in his book ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' that the government exerted enough control over private industry that it was not necessary to [[nationalisation|nationalise]] it as [[Clause IV|the party had long called to do]], and that the ultimate goals of [[socialism]] could be as readily achieved by assuring long-term economic stability and building out the social [[welfare state]]. His \"[[The Future of Socialism#Labour revisionism|revisionist]]\" views became Labour's perspective on the [[post-war consensus]], in which both they and the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]] agreed in principle on a strong government role in the economy, strong unions and a welfare state as foundational to Britain's prosperity.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\">{{cite book |last=L\u00f3pez |first=Tara Martin |title=The Winter of Discontent: Myth, Memory and History |date=2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9781781386019 |pages=40\u201345}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, following the surge in radical left-wing politics of the late 1960s, that view was challenged in another Labour figure's book, [[Stuart Holland]]'s ''The Socialist Challenge''. He argued that contrary to Crosland's assertions, the government could exercise little control over Britain's largest companies, which were likely to continue consolidating into an [[oligopoly]] that, by the 1980s, could raise prices high enough that governments following [[Keynesian economics]] would be unable to ensure their citizens the opportunity for [[full employment]] that they had been able to since the war, and exploit [[transfer pricing]] to avoid paying British taxes. Holland called for  returning to nationalisation, arguing that taking control of the top 25 companies that way would result in a market with more competition and less inflation.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nHolland's ideas formed the basis of the [[Alternative Economic Strategy]] (AES) promoted by [[Tony Benn]], then [[Secretary of State for Industry]] in the Labour governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] as they considered responses to [[Pound sterling#1976 sterling crisis|the sterling crisis]] in 1976. The AES called on Britain to adopt a [[protectionism|protectionist]] stance in international trade, including reversing [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|its recent decision to join the European Common Market]], and impose no incomes policy to combat inflation. Benn believed that this approach was more in keeping with Labour's traditional policies and would have its strongest supporters in the unions and outside of them vigorously supporting the government against opposition from the financial sector and commanding heights of industry. It was ultimately rejected in favor of the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]] and extensive cuts in public spending as the condition of an [[International Monetary Fund]] loan that supported the pound.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\nThe left wing of the Labour Party, while critical of the revisionist approach and the Social Contract, was not universally supportive of the AES either. Many thought it did not go far enough, or avoided the issue of nationalisation. [[Feminism in the United Kingdom|Feminists]] in particular criticised it for its focus on traditionally male-dominated manufacturing jobs and ignoring the broader issues that the increasing amount of women in the workforce faced, preferring a focus on broader social issues rather than just working conditions and pay, the traditional areas unions had negotiated with employers.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 40\u201345\" />\n\n===1960s\u201370s labour law reforms===\n\nIn 1968 Wilson's government appointed the [[Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations|Donovan Commission]] to review [[United Kingdom labour law|British labour law]] with an eye toward reducing the days lost to strikes every year; many Britons had come to believe the unions were too powerful despite the country's economic growth since the war. It found much of the problem to lie in a parallel system of 'official' signed agreements between unions and employers, and [[Side letter|'unofficial', often unwritten ones]] at the local level, between [[shop steward]]s and managers, which often took precedence in practice over the official ones. The government responded with ''[[In Place of Strife]]'' a [[white paper]] by [[Secretary of State for Employment]] [[Barbara Castle]], which recommended restrictions on unions' ability to strike, such as requiring strikes take place after a member vote and fining unions for unofficial strikes.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 36\">L\u00f3pez, 36</ref>\n\nThe [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) vigorously opposed making Castle's recommendations law, and Callaghan, then [[Home Secretary]], led a cabinet revolt which led to its abandonment. Callaghan did not believe it would be effective in curtailing unofficial strikes, that the proposals could not pass, and the effort would create unnecessary tension between the government and the unions that were key to its political strength.<ref name=\"Lopez 37\">{{cite book|last=Callaghan|first=James|authorlink=James Callaghan|title=Time and Chance|page=274|date=1987|publisher=Collins|isbn=9780002165150}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, 37</ref>\n\nAfter the Conservatives won [[1970 United Kingdom general election|the following year's election]], they implemented their own legislation to address the issue. The [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]], modeled in part on the U.S. [[Taft-Hartley Act]], passed over determined union opposition, included many of the same provisions as ''In Place of Strife'', and explicitly stated that formal [[collective bargaining agreement]]s would have the force of law unless they had [[disclaimer]]s to the contrary. It also created a [[National Industrial Relations Court]] to handle disputes and put unions under a central registry to enforce their rules.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 38\">L\u00f3pez, 38</ref>\n\nNew Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] hoped that the new law would not only address the strike issue but the steep [[inflation]] plaguing the British economy (along with other industrial capitalist economies) at the time, eliminating the need for a separate [[incomes policy]] by having a moderating effect on pay increases demanded by unions. Ongoing union resistance to the Industrial Relations Act led to a [[House of Lords]] ruling in their favor over demonstrations and widespread unofficial strikes following the [[Pentonville Five]]'s imprisonment for continuing to picket a London container depot in violation of a court order, which undermined the legislation. Coal miners [[UK miners' strike (1972)|officially went on strike]] for the first time in almost half a century in 1972; after two months the strike was settled with the miners getting a 21 per cent increase, less than half of what they had originally sought.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\">L\u00f3pez, 39</ref>\n\nHeath as a result turned to an incomes policy; inflation continued to worsen. Its implementation was abandoned in 1973 when [[1973 oil shock|that year's oil embargo]] nearly doubled prices within months. To meet demand for heat in the wintertime, the government had to return to coal, giving the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] more leverage. The government declared a [[state of emergency]] that November, and at the beginning of 1974 limited all nonessential businesses to [[Three-Day Week|three days of electricity each week]] to conserve power. Miners, who had seen their rise from two years before turn into a pay cut in real terms due to the inflation the government had not brought under control, voted overwhelmingly to go on strike in late January.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" />\n\nTwo weeks later, the government responded by calling [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|an election]], running on the slogan \"Who Governs Britain?\". At the end of the month the Conservatives no longer did; Labour and Wilson returned, but [[hung parliament|without a majority]]. They were able to pass the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]], which repealed the Heath government's Industrial Relations Act.<ref name=\"L\u00f3pez 39\" /> \n\nIn [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October]] they won a majority of three seats; still they needed a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal Party]] to have a majority on many issues. Callaghan, now [[Foreign Secretary]], warned his fellow Cabinet members at the time of the possibility of \"a breakdown of democracy\", telling them that \"If I were a young man, I would emigrate.\"<ref name=\"beckett2010\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NURERF4hb8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA175#v=onepage&f=false | title=When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies | publisher=Faber & Faber | author=Beckett, Andy | year=2010 | pages=175 | isbn=978-0-571-22137-0}}</ref>\n\n===Incomes policy===\n\nWilson, and Callaghan, who succeeded him as Prime Minister after Wilson resigned for health reasons in 1976, continued to fight inflation, which peaked at 26.9 per cent in the 12 months to August 1975.

Previous governments had brought in incomes policies backed by [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], but the social contract agreed that this would not happen.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n====Phases I and II====\nPhase I of the pay policy was announced on 11 July 1975 with a [[white paper]] entitled ''The Attack on Inflation''. This proposed a limit on wage rises of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]6 per week for all earning below \u00a38,500 annually.  The [[TUC General Council]] had accepted these proposals by 19 votes to 13. On 5 May 1976 the TUC accepted a new policy for 1976 increases, beginning 1 August, of between \u00a32.50 and \u00a34 per week with further years outlined.  At the Annual Congress on 8 September 1976 the TUC rejected a motion which called for a return to free [[collective bargaining]] (which meant no incomes policy at all) once Phase I expired on 1 August 1977. This new policy was Phase II of the incomes policy.<ref name=hay> Hay, \"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\"</ref>\n\n====Phase III====\nOn 15 July 1977, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]] announced Phase III of the incomes policy in which there was to be a phased return to free collective bargaining, without \"a free-for-all\".  After prolonged negotiations, the TUC agreed to continue with the modest increases recommended for 1977\u201378 under Phase II limits and not to try to reopen pay agreements made under the previous policy, while the Government agreed not to intervene in pay negotiations. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] criticised the power of the unions and lack of any stronger policy to cover the period from the summer of 1978. The inflation rate continued to fall through 1977 and by 1978 the annual rate fell below 10 per cent.<ref name=hay/>\n\nAt the end of the year [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Bernard Donoughue]], Callaghan's chief policy advisor, sent him a memo analysing possible election dates. He concluded that the following October or November would be the best option, as the economy was likely to remain in good shape through then. After that, he wrote, the outlook was unclear, with pressure from the government's own incomes policy likely.<ref name=\"The Heat of the Kitchen\">{{cite book|last=Donoughue|first=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|title=The Heat of the Kitchen: An Autobiography|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/yE4KAQAAMAAJ?hl=en|page=298|date=2003|isbn=9781842750513}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 56\u201357]</ref>\n\n====Five per cent limit====\nAt a May 1978 Downing Street lunch with editors and reporters from the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', Callaghan asked if they believed it was possible that the planned Phase IV would succeed, as he believed it would if the unions and their members understood it was the best way to keep Labour in power. Most told him that it would be difficult, but not impossible. [[Geoffrey Goodman]] disagreed, saying in his view it would be impossible for the union leaders to keep their membership from demanding higher pay increases. \"If that is the case, then I will go over the heads of the trade union leadership and appeal directly to their members\u2014and the voters\", the prime minister responded. \"We have to hold the line on pay or else the government will fall.\"<ref name=\"Goodman 220\u201321\">{{cite book |last1=Goodman |first1=Geoffrey |authorlink1=Geoffrey Goodman |title=From Bevan to Blair: Fifty Years Reporting from the Political Frontline |date=2003 |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=9780745321783 |pages=220\u201321 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqlZAAAAMAAJ}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nHaving prepared for the imminent end of the [[incomes policy]], global inflation supervened and was coming towards [[Interest rate#Historical interest rates|record levels during the 1978\u201382 period]].{{refn|And therefore a second trigger for a rise in [[inflation]]|group= n}} On 21 July 1978 [[Denis Healey]] introduced a new White Paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5 per cent in the year from 1 August. Callaghan was determined to keep inflation down to single figures, however trade union leaders warned the government that the 5 per cent limit was unachievable, and urged a more flexible approach with a range of settlements between 5 and 8 per cent. [[Terry Duffy]] president of the AUEW described the limit as 'political suicide'. Denis Healey also privately expressed scepticism about the achievability of the limit. The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to [[collective bargaining|free collective bargaining]] as they were promised.<ref name=\"Conroy\">{{cite book |last1=Conroy |first1=Harry |title=Callaghan |date=2006 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=1-904950-70-1 |pages=109-124}}</ref><ref name=hay/> \n\nIt had been widely expected that Callaghan would call a general election in the autumn of 1978, and that the 5 per cent limit would be revised if Labour won. At a private dinner before that year's TUC conference, Callaghan discussed election strategy with the leaders of major unions. He asked whether he should call an autumn election; with the exception of Scanlon they all urged him to call for one no later than November. Any later, they said, and they could not guarantee their memberships would remain on the job and off the picket line through the winter.<ref name=\"Goodman 226\u201327\">Goodman, 226\u201327, cited at L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 60\u201361]</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly however on 7 September, Callaghan announced that he would not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued pay restraint so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election, therefore the 5 per cent limit stood. The pay limit was officially termed \"Phase IV\" but most referred to it as \"the 5 per cent limit\". Although the government did not make the 5 per cent limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.<ref name=hay/><ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=A.J. |title=To Build a New Jerusalem |date=1996 |isbn=0-349-10809-9 |pages=363-368}}</ref>\n\n===Changes in labour movement===\n\nBetween 1966 and 1979, Britain's unions were changing and becoming more diverse. Most of the increase in union membership was driven by women returning to or entering the workforce\u201473 per cent of them joined a union during that period against 19.3 per cent of men newly in work, as manufacturing jobs, traditionally heavily male, disappeared. Black and Asian workers also filled union ranks; in 1977 61 per cent of black men in work belonged to a union as opposed to 47 per cent of white men.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA32 32\u201333]</ref> Asian women became the face of the labour movement during the 1976\u201378 [[Grunwick dispute]] over pay and conditions at a film processing plant in suburban London.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\">L\u00f3pez, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVy1DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 57\u201359]</ref>\n\nWithin unions, power was also devolving to the rank and file. The political upheavals of the late 1960s in Europe and the United States had brought [[participatory democracy]] to the fore, and workers felt [[Industrial democracy|they should be taking decisions]], including about when and whether to strike, that had hitherto been the province of union leadership. [[Hugh Scanlon]], who took over as head of the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union|Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers]] (AUEW) in 1967, and [[Jack Jones (trade unionist)|Jack Jones]], general secretary of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]] (TGWU) from shortly afterward, were known among union leaders as \"the dubious duo\" for their advocacy for devolution.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" />\n\n====Dissatisfied public employees====\n\nMany new members were also coming from government jobs. In 1974, about half of the total British workforce was unionised, but 83.1 per cent of all public-sector workers were. In the health sector that reached 90 per cent. Many of the government workers joining unions were women.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 32\" /> \n\nThe public employees were in a particularly difficult position with regard to incomes policy. Governments kept their employees' pay, already lower than their private-sector colleagues, low both because they could and because they wanted to set an example for the private sector, an example the private sector rarely followed. Their unions were also frustrated that their growing numbers had not yet translated into corresponding influence within the TUC.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 111\">L\u00f3pez, 111</ref>\n\nThese matters came to a head with the 1977 fire brigadiers' strike, a strike that many brigadiers were conflicted about since they knew they would be abandoning their own profession's duty to protect life, but felt that they could no longer make ends meet with their pay packets. They asked a 30 per cent increase, 20 per cent over the government's limit at the time, and a limit to 42 hours of work each week. The government responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]] and bringing in Army troops as replacements. The TUC voted late in the strike to not campaign in support of the brigadiers, in order to maintain its relationship with the government.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 57\u201359\" />\n\n===\"Stepping Stones\" and hardening of Conservative position on unionism===\n\n[[Margaret Thatcher]] was elected [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative leader]] to succeed Heath in 1975. She had been known as a member of his Cabinet, where she served as [[Secretary of State for Education]], for her advocacy of market-based solutions over government intervention in the economy, and had become convinced, as she wrote later, by that experience that the only thing more damaging to the British economy than Labour's socialist policies was her own party's attempts to emulate them. Influenced by writers such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Colm Brogan]], she came to believe the power of British unions under the [[postwar consensus]] had come at the expense of Britain as a whole.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\">L\u00f3pez, 55\u201357</ref>\n\nIn 1977 two of her advisors, [[John Hoskyns]] and Norman Strauss, prepared a report called \"[[John Hoskyns#The Stepping Stones Report, 1977|Stepping Stones]]\" which diagrammed the [[vicious cycle]] through which they believed the unions' influence exacerbated Britain's ongoing economic difficulties, such as [[unemployment in the United Kingdom|unemployment]] and inflation. Thatcher made it available to her [[Shadow Cabinet of Margaret Thatcher|shadow cabinet]] with the authors' recommendation that they all read it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hoskyns|first1=John|authorlink1=John Hoskyns|last2=Strauss|first2=Norman|title=Stepping Stones|url=https://c59574e9047e61130f13-3f71d0fe2b653c4f00f32175760e96e7.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/5B6518B5823043FE9D7C54846CC7FE31.pdf|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date=14 November 1977|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> By the end of the year she had formed a steering group to develop a specific policy aimed at curbing union power under a Tory government, and a media strategy that would invest the public in this.<ref name=\"Tara Martin Lopez 55\u201357\" />\n\nTo implement the media strategy, the party hired the advertising firm of [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], whose 1978 \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign has been credited with persuading Callaghan not to hold an election that year.{{efn|Like his counterpart Donoughue, Hoskyns had concluded that the optimal time for an election for Labour was earlier, in the spring of 1978, with autumn being still slightly favorable, but the economic prospects unclear after that. He also preferred a later election as it would give the party the time necessary to make its case for a radical change in Britain's relations with its unions.<ref>Hoskyns, 45</ref>}} In 1978 Britain's largest tabloid, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', dropped its longtime support for Labour to instead embrace the Tories.

Ford had enjoyed a good year, and could afford to offer a large pay rise to its workers.  The company was, however, also a major government contractor.  Ford's management therefore made a pay offer within the 5 per cent guidelines. In response, 15,000 Ford workers, mostly from the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] (TGWU), began an unofficial strike on 22 September 1978, which subsequently became an official TGWU action on 5 October.  The number of participants grew to 57,000.\n\nDuring the strike, [[Vauxhall Motors]] employees accepted an 8.5 per cent rise.  After long negotiation in which they weighed the chances of suffering from government sanctions against the continued damage of the strike, Ford eventually revised their offer to 17 per cent and decided to accept the sanctions; Ford workers accepted the rise on 22 November.\n\n==Political difficulties==\nAs the Ford strike was starting, the Labour Party conference began at [[Blackpool]]. Terry Duffy, the delegate from [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] Constituency Labour Party and a supporter of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group, moved a motion on 2 October which demanded \"that the Government immediately cease intervening in wage negotiations\". Despite a plea from [[Michael Foot]] not to put the motion to the vote, the resolution was carried by 4,017,000 to 1,924,000. The next day, the Prime Minister accepted the fact of defeat by saying \"I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday\", but insisted that he would not let up on the fight against inflation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Labour Party|title=Report of the Annual Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjCNAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Labour Representation Committee|page=235}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the government's situation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] was increasingly difficult; through by-elections it had lost its majority of three seats in 1976 and had been forced to put together a [[Lab-Lib pact#1977|pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1977 in order to keep winning votes on legislation; the pact lapsed in July 1978.  A decision to grant extra parliamentary seats to [[Northern Ireland]] afforded temporary support from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], but the Unionists were clear that this support would be withdrawn immediately after the Bill to grant extra seats had been passed &ndash; it was through the Ulster Unionists agreeing to abstain that the government defeated a [[motion of no confidence]] by 312 to 300 on 9 November.<ref name=hay/>\n\n===Further negotiation at the TUC===\nBy the middle of November it was clear that Ford would offer an increase substantially over the 5 per cent limit. The government subsequently entered into intense negotiations with the TUC, hoping to produce an agreement on pay policy that would prevent disputes and show political unity in the run-up to the general election. A limited and weak formula was eventually worked out and put to the General Council of the TUC on 14 November, but its General Council vote was tied 14\u201314, with the formula being rejected on the chair's casting vote. One important personality on the TUC General Council had changed earlier in 1978 with [[Moss Evans]] replacing [[Jack Jones (trade union leader)|Jack Jones]] at the TGWU. Evans proved a weak leader of his union, although it is doubtful whether Jones could have restrained the actions of some of the TGWU shop stewards.\n\nAfter Ford settled, the government announced on 28 November that sanctions{{clarify|date=August 2013}} would be imposed on Ford, along with 220 other companies, for breach of the pay policy. The announcement of actual sanctions produced an immediate protest from the [[Confederation of British Industry]] which announced that it would challenge their legality. The Conservatives put down a motion in the House of Commons to revoke the sanctions. A co-ordinated protest by left-wing Labour MPs over spending on defence forced the debate set for 7 December to be postponed; however on 13 December an anti-sanctions amendment was passed by 285 to 279. The substantive motion as amended was then passed by 285 to 283. James Callaghan put down a further motion of confidence for the next day, which the government won by ten votes (300 to 290), but accepted that his government could not use sanctions. In effect this deprived the government of any means of enforcing the 5 per cent limit on private industry.\n\n==Onset of severe winter weather==\n\nA mild autumn turned cold on the morning of 25 November when temperatures recorded at [[Heathrow Airport]] dropped from {{convert|14|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|0|\u00b0C}} overnight, with some snowflakes. Throughout most of the following month, the cold lingered, only for temperatures to rise well above {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} around Christmas. On 30 December, the temperature dropped again, along with rain that soon turned to snow; the next day 1978 ended with Heathrow recording a high of only {{convert|-3|\u00b0C}} amid steady snowfall.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\">{{cite book |last1=Nobbs |first1=Patrick |title=The Story of the British and Their Weather: From Frost Fairs to Indian Summers |date=2015 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Ltd. |isbn=9781445644615 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUp4BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT92&lpg=PT9 |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |chapter=9; The Winter of Discontent 1978\u201379}}</ref>\n\nThe effects were more severe outside of London. [[Ilfracombe]] and other towns in [[North Devon]] could only be reached by helicopter as many roads could not be adequately cleared. The [[Royal Automobile Club]] blamed local councils, who in turn pointed to unresolved issues with their unions and staff shortages; even around London local authorities were only able to clear main roads. Two Scottish trains near [[Stirling]] were stuck in the snow, leaving 300 passengers stranded; rail transport difficulties were exacerbated elsewhere in the country by a strike. Tanker drivers had also gone on strike in some areas from 18 December, causing some homeowners to have difficulties keeping their homes heated and limiting petrol supplies. Only three [[English Football League|League]] football matches could take place over the [[New Year's Day|New Year's]] holiday, and all rugby contests were canceled. Three men drowned after falling through the ice on the [[Hampstead Heath]] pond in London.<ref name=\"The British and their weather\" />\n\n==Lorry drivers' strike==\nWith the government now having no way of enforcing its pay policy, unions which had not yet put in pay claims began to increase their aim. [[truck|Lorry]] drivers, represented by the TGWU, had demanded rises of up to 40 per cent on 18 December; years of expansion in the industry had left employers short of drivers, and those drivers who had jobs often worked 70\u201380 hours a week for minimal pay.<ref>L\u00f3pez, 90</ref> The [[Road Haulage Association]] (RHA), the industry trade group, had initially told [[Secretary of State for Transport]] [[Bill Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|William Rodgers]], a member of the Labour Party's right wing who had become sceptical of the public's appetite for the completion of the party's socialist programme that it would stay within the 5 per cent ceiling. But as 1979 began, the RHA, whom Rodgers saw as disorganised and easily intimidated by the TGWU, suddenly increased its offer to 13 per cent, in hopes of settling before strikes became widespread.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rodgers|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|title=Fourth Among Equals|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fourth_Among_Equals/0L0hAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0|page=181|publisher=Politico's|date=2000}}, cited at L\u00f3pez, 92</ref>\n\nThe offer had the opposite effect. Drivers, emboldened by memories of a strike the previous winter by South Wales hauliers that won participants a 20 per cent rise, decided they could do better by walking out. The union's national leadership was, as they had anticipated in their September dinner with Callaghan, doubtful they could restrain the local leaders. On 2 January Rodgers warned the Cabinet that a national road-haulage strike was about to happen, but cautioned against pressuring the RHA to improve their offer even more.<ref>Rodgers, 180, cited at L\u00f3pez, 93</ref>\n\nThe next day an unofficial strike of all TGWU lorry drivers began. With petrol distribution held up, petrol stations closed across the country. The strikers also [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] the main ports. The strikes were made official on 11 January by the TGWU and 12 January by the United Road Transport Union. With 80 per cent of the nation's goods transported by road, roads still not completely cleared from the earlier storm, essential supplies were put in danger as striking drivers picketed those firms that continued to work. While the oil tanker drivers were working, the main refineries were also targeted and the tanker drivers let the strikers know where they were going, allowing for flying pickets to turn them back at their destination. More than a million UK workers were laid off temporarily during the disputes.\n\nIn [[Kingston upon Hull]], striking hauliers were able to blockade the city's two main roads effectively enough to control what goods were allowed into and out of the city, and companies made their case to their own nominal employees to get past the barricades. Newspaper headlines likened the situation to a siege, and the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]; fears that food supplies would also be impacted fueled [[panic buying]]. Such coverage often exaggerated the reach of the strikers, which served both their interest and their employers'.<ref>L\u00f3pez, 94</ref> It also helped the Conservatives disseminate \"Stepping Stones\"' arguments about unionism out of control to the public; letters to the editor across the country reflected a growing public anger with the unions.<ref>L\u00f3pez, 107</ref>\n\nDue to the disruption of fuel supplies, the [[Cabinet Office]] prepared to implement previous plans for \"Operation Drumstick\", by which the [[British Army|Army]] were put on standby to take over from the tanker drivers. However, the operation would need the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] in order to allow conscription of the assets of the oil companies, and the government drew back from such a step. Before the situation developed into a crisis the oil companies settled on wage rises of around 15 per cent.\n\nA further plan was drawn up to call a state of emergency and safeguard essential supplies through the Army, regarding which the government warned the TGWU leadership, which resulted in the union accepting (12 January 1979) a list of emergency supplies which were officially exempt from action. In practice, what counted as an emergency was left up to local officials of the TGWU to determine, and practice across the country varied according to the views of the local shop stewards who established \"dispensation committees\" to decide. When strikers in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] did not allow the correct mix of animal feed through to local farms, the farmers dropped the bodies of dead piglets and chickens outside the union offices; the union contended that the farmers had actually wrung the chicken's necks to kill them, and the piglets had been killed when the sow rolled over and crushed them.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn 29 January, lorry drivers in the South West accepted a deal awarded by an [[arbitration|arbitration panel]] of a rise of up to 20 per cent, just \u00a31 per week less than the union had been striking for; this settlement proved a model which was accepted throughout the country.\n\n==\"Crisis? What crisis?\"==\nOn 10 January, [[James Callaghan]] arrived back from a [[Guadeloupe Conference|summit in Guadeloupe]] in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. Having been tipped off that the press were present, his press secretary Tom McCaffrey advised him to say nothing and return immediately to work, but his political adviser [[Thomas McNally, Baron McNally|Tom McNally]] thought that the image of Callaghan returning and declaring his intent to take control of the situation would be reassuring. Callaghan therefore decided to give a press conference at [[Heathrow Airport]]. To McNally's dismay Callaghan was jocular and referred to having had a swim in the Caribbean during the summit. He was then asked (by a reporter from the ''[[Evening Standard]]'') \"What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?\" and replied:\n\n{{Quote|Well, that's a judgment that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.}}\n\nThe next day's edition of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' featured the famous headline \"Crisis? What crisis?\" with a subheading \"Rail, lorry, jobs chaos \u2013 and Jim blames Press\", condemning Callaghan as being \"out of touch\" with British society.<ref name=bbc>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml BBC News \u2013 History of the Winter of Discontent]</ref>\n\n==Public sector employees==\n22 January 1979 was the biggest individual day of strike action since the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike]] of 1926, and many workers stayed out indefinitely afterwards.  With many in the private sector having achieved substantial rises, the public sector unions became increasingly concerned to keep pace in terms of pay. The government had already announced a slight weakening of the policy on 16 January, which gave the unions cause for hope that they might win and use free collective bargaining. Train drivers belonging to [[ASLEF]] and the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] had already begun a series of 24-hour strikes, and the [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference on 18 January decided to ask that the pay of nurses be increased to the same level in real terms as 1974, which would mean a 25 per cent average rise.  The public sector unions labelled the date the \"Day of Action\", in which they held a 24-hour strike and marched to demand a \u00a360 per week minimum wage.\n\nWith the succession of strikes having been called and then won, many groups of workers began to take unofficial action \u2013 often without the consent or support of the union leaderships. Ambulance drivers began to take strike action in mid-January, and in parts of the country (London, West Midlands, [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland) their action included refusing to attend 999 emergency calls. In these areas, the Army was drafted in to provide a skeleton service. Ancillary hospital staff also went on strike.<ref name=bbc/> On 30 January, the [[Secretary of State for Social Services]] [[David Ennals]] announced that 1,100 of 2,300 [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospitals were only treating emergencies, that practically no ambulance service was operating normally, and that the ancillary health service workers were deciding which cases merited treatment. The media reported with scorn that [[cancer]] patients were being prevented from getting essential treatment.\n\n===Gravediggers' strike===\nA notorious industrial action during the winter, and one which was later frequently referred to by Conservative politicians, was the strike by gravediggers, members of the [[GMWU]] in [[Liverpool]] and in [[Tameside]] near [[Manchester]].<ref>Moore (2014), p. 399.</ref> Eighty gravediggers being on strike, [[Liverpool City Council]] hired a factory in [[Speke]] to store the corpses until they could be buried. The Department of Environment noted that there were 150 bodies stored at the factory at one point, with 25 more added every day. The reports of unburied bodies caused concern with the public.<ref name=\"Travis\">{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Alan|title=National archives: Fear of fights at cemetery gates during 1979 winter of discontent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/liverpool-gravedigger-strikes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 December 2009}}</ref> On 1 February a persistent journalist asked the Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Bolton, what would be done if the strike continued for months, Bolton speculated that [[burial at sea]] would be considered. Although his response was hypothetical, in the circumstances it caused great alarm. Other alternatives were considered, including allowing the bereaved to dig their own funeral's graves, deploying troops, and engaging private contractors to inter the bodies.  The main concerns were said to be aesthetic because bodies could be safely stored in heat-sealed bags for up to six weeks.<ref name=\"Travis\"/> Bolton later reported being \"horrified\" by the sensationalised reportage of the strike in the mass media.<ref>James Thomas, '\"Bound by History\": The Winter of Discontent in British Politics 1979\u20132004', ''Media, Culture and Society'', 29 (2007), p. 270.</ref> The gravediggers eventually settled for a 14 per cent rise after a fortnight's strike.\n\n===Waste collectors===\nWith many collectors having been on strike since 22 January, local authorities began to run out of space for storing waste and used local parks under their control. The Conservative controlled [[Westminster City Council]] used [[Leicester Square]] in the heart of London's West End for piles of rubbish and, as the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' reported, this attracted [[rat]]s.\n\nOn 21 February, a settlement of the local authority workers' dispute was agreed, whereby workers got an 11 per cent rise, plus \u00a31 per week, with the possibility of extra rises, should a pay comparability study recommend them. Some left-wing local authorities, among them the [[London Borough of Camden]], conceded the union demands in full (known as the \"Camden surplus\") and then saw an investigation by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|District Auditor]], which eventually ruled it a breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]]{{refn|Owed to the payers, the ratepayers of the area|group= n}} and therefore illegal. Camden Borough councillors, among them [[Ken Livingstone]], avoided [[Surcharge (sanction on public servant)|surcharge]]. Livingstone was Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] at the time the decision not to impose a surcharge was made.\n\n==End of the strikes==\nStrikes by essential services dismayed many senior ministers in the Labour government who had been close to the trade union movement, who had thought it unlikely that trade unionists would take such action. Among these was Prime Minister James Callaghan himself, who had built his political career on his connection to the trade unions, and had practically founded one, the [[Inland Revenue Staff Federation]]. Callaghan called the actions of the strikers \"free collective vandalism\".<ref>{{cite web |title=CALLAGHAN DEPICTS STRIKERS AS VANDALS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/callaghan-depicts-strikers-as-vandals-britons-woes-mount-as-workers.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=30 November 2019 |date=2 February 1979}}</ref><ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe government was negotiating with the senior union leaders and on 11 February came to agreement on a proposal to be put to the TUC General Council. On 14 February the General Council agreed the concordat, published under the title \"The Economy, the Government, and Trade Union Responsibilities\".{{refn|The significance of a comprehensive agreement on [[Valentine's Day]] was remarked upon by the press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}|group= n}} By this stage union executives had limited control over their members and strikes did not immediately cease, although they began to wind down from this point. In total in 1979, 29,474,000 working days were lost in industrial disputes, compared with 9,306,000 in 1978.\n\n==Political fallout==\nIn the summer before the Winter of Discontent, the minority Labour government's fortunes in the opinion polls had been improving and suggested that they could gain an overall majority in the event of a general election being held. However, on 7 September 1978, Callaghan announced that no general election would be held that year. Callaghan's failure to call an election would ultimately prove to be a costly mistake for his government.<ref name=calruns>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm |work=BBC News | title=1978: Callaghan accused of running scared | date=7 September 1978}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Thatcher]], who won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and became Prime Minister]]\nThe strikes appeared to have a profound effect on voting intention. According to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], Labour had a lead of 5 percentage points over the Conservatives in November 1978, which turned to a Conservative lead of 7.5 percentage points in January 1979, and of 20 percentage points in February. On 1 March, referendums on [[devolution]] to Scotland and Wales were held. That in Wales went strongly against devolution; that in Scotland produced a small majority in favour which did not reach the threshold set by Parliament of 40 per cent of that electorate. The government's decision not to press ahead with devolution immediately led the [[Scottish National Party]] to withdraw support from the government and on 28 March in a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|motion of no confidence the government lost by one vote]], precipitating a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]].\n\n[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] had already outlined her proposals for restricting trade union power in a [[party political broadcast]] on 17 January in the middle of the lorry drivers' strike. During the election campaign the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] made extensive use of the disruption caused during the strike. One broadcast on 23 April began with the Sun's headline \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" being shown and read out by an increasingly desperate voiceover interspersed with film footage of piles of rubbish, closed factories, picketed hospitals and locked graveyards. The scale of the Conservatives' victory in the general election has often been ascribed to the effect of the strikes, as well as their \"[[Labour Isn't Working]]\" campaign, and the party used film of the events of the winter in election campaigns for years to come.\n\nFollowing Thatcher's election win, she brought the [[post-war consensus]] to a halt and made drastic changes to trade union laws (most notably the regulation that unions had to hold a ballot among members before calling strikes) and as a result strikes were at their lowest level for 30 years by the time of the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], which the Conservatives won by a landslide.<ref name=\"83electionyoutube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7noHkLaZ5VI|title=Conservative Party Election Broadcast (1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Organized labour|United Kingdom}}\n* [[Strike wave of 1945\u201346]], in U.S., followed by election of conservative Republican majorities in Congress who also passed laws restricting union activities\n* [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[1979 Chicago blizzard]], where the city's inability to clear streets and ensure functioning public transit for weeks afterwards cost the incumbent mayor the primary election.\n* [[February 1969 nor'easter]], winter storm where dysfunctional snow removal afterwards cost New York City mayor [[John Lindsay]] his party's nomination, although he ultimately won re-election later that year\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Beckett, Andy.

It is one of a group of closely related animals that are descended from a common ancestral line of [[toad]]s and which form a [[species complex]]. The toad is an inconspicuous animal as it usually lies hidden during the day. It becomes active at dusk and spends the night hunting for the [[invertebrate]]s on which it feeds. It moves with a slow, ungainly walk or short jumps, and has greyish-brown skin covered with wart-like lumps.\n\nAlthough toads are usually solitary animals, in the breeding season, large numbers of toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings in the water and later hatch out into [[tadpole]]s. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo [[metamorphosis]] into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe common toad seems to be in decline in part of its range, but overall is listed as being of \"[[least concern]]\" in the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].<ref name=\"iucn\" /> It is threatened by habitat loss, especially by drainage of its breeding sites, and some toads get killed on the roads as they make their annual migrations. It has long been associated in popular culture and literature with [[witchcraft]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File:Toad shoulder girdle.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Shoulder girdle|Skeleton showing shoulder girdle; {{nowrap|1: suprascapula}}, {{nowrap|2: scapula}}, {{nowrap|3: clavicle}}, {{nowrap|4: procoracoid}}]]\nThe common toad was first given the name ''[[Rana (genus)|Rana]] bufo'' by the Swedish biologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in the ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae]]'' in 1758.<ref>{{cite book |author=von Linn\u00e9, Carl  |author-link=Carl Linnaeus |translator= [[William Turton]]|year=1806 |title=A General System of Nature,: Through the Three Grand Kingdoms of Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals, Systematically Divided Into Their Several Classes, Orders, Genera, Species, and Varieties (Volume&nbsp;1) |publisher=Lackington, Allen, and Co |pages=648\u2013649 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3QZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> In this work, he placed all the frogs and toads in the single genus ''Rana''.

Females are normally stouter than males and southern specimens tend to be larger than northern ones. The head is broad with a wide mouth below the terminal snout which has two small nostrils. There are no teeth. The bulbous, protruding eyes have yellow or copper coloured irises and horizontal slit-shaped pupils. Just behind the eyes are two bulging regions, the paratoid glands, which are positioned obliquely. They contain a noxious substance, [[bufotoxin]], which is used to deter potential [[Predation|predators]]. The head joins the body without a noticeable neck and there is no external vocal sac. The body is broad and squat and positioned close to the ground. The fore limbs are short with the toes of the fore feet turning inwards. At breeding time, the male develops [[nuptial pad]]s on the first three fingers. He uses these to grasp the female when mating. The hind legs are short relative to other frogs' legs and the hind feet have long, unwebbed toes. There is no tail. The skin is dry and covered with small wart-like lumps. The colour is a fairly uniform shade of brown, olive-brown or greyish-brown, sometimes partly blotched or banded with a darker shade. The common toad tends to be [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] with the females being browner and the males greyer.<ref name=Naish>{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/10/26/toads-of-the-north/ |title=Toads of the world: first, (some) toads of the north |author=Naish, Darren |publisher=Tetrapod zoology |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> The underside is a dirty white speckled with grey and black patches.<ref name=Collins/><ref name=AmphibiaWeb>{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Bufo&where-species=bufo |title=''Bufo bufo'': Common toad |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=2012-05-04}}</ref>\n\nOther species with which the common toad could be confused include the [[natterjack toad]] (''Bufo calamita'') and the [[European green toad]] (''Bufo viridis'').

It is one of a group of closely related animals that are descended from a common ancestral line of [[toad]]s and which form a [[species complex]]. The toad is an inconspicuous animal as it usually lies hidden during the day. It becomes active at dusk and spends the night hunting for the [[invertebrate]]s on which it feeds. It moves with a slow, ungainly walk or short jumps, and has greyish-brown skin covered with wart-like lumps.\n\nAlthough toads are usually solitary animals, in the breeding season, large numbers of toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings in the water and later hatch out into [[tadpole]]s. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo [[metamorphosis]] into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe common toad seems to be in decline in part of its range, but overall is listed as being of \"[[least concern]]\" in the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].<ref name=\"iucn\" /> It is threatened by habitat loss, especially by drainage of its breeding sites, and some toads get killed on the roads as they make their annual migrations. It has long been associated in popular culture and literature with [[witchcraft]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File:Toad shoulder girdle.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Shoulder girdle|Skeleton showing shoulder girdle; {{nowrap|1: suprascapula}}, {{nowrap|2: scapula}}, {{nowrap|3: clavicle}}, {{nowrap|4: procoracoid}}]]\nThe common toad was first given the name ''[[Rana (genus)|Rana]] bufo'' by the Swedish biologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in the ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae]]'' in 1758.<ref>{{cite book |author=von Linn\u00e9, Carl  |author-link=Carl Linnaeus |translator= [[William Turton]]|year=1806 |title=A General System of Nature,: Through the Three Grand Kingdoms of Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals, Systematically Divided Into Their Several Classes, Orders, Genera, Species, and Varieties (Volume&nbsp;1) |publisher=Lackington, Allen, and Co |pages=648\u2013649 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3QZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> In this work, he placed all the frogs and toads in the single genus ''Rana''.

Females are normally stouter than males and southern specimens tend to be larger than northern ones. The head is broad with a wide mouth below the terminal snout which has two small nostrils. There are no teeth. The bulbous, protruding eyes have yellow or copper coloured irises and horizontal slit-shaped pupils. Just behind the eyes are two bulging regions, the paratoid glands, which are positioned obliquely. They contain a noxious substance, [[bufotoxin]], which is used to deter potential [[Predation|predators]]. The head joins the body without a noticeable neck and there is no external vocal sac. The body is broad and squat and positioned close to the ground. The fore limbs are short with the toes of the fore feet turning inwards. At breeding time, the male develops [[nuptial pad]]s on the first three fingers. He uses these to grasp the female when mating. The hind legs are short relative to other frogs' legs and the hind feet have long, unwebbed toes. There is no tail. The skin is dry and covered with small wart-like lumps. The colour is a fairly uniform shade of brown, olive-brown or greyish-brown, sometimes partly blotched or banded with a darker shade. The common toad tends to be [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] with the females being browner and the males greyer.<ref name=Naish>{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/10/26/toads-of-the-north/ |title=Toads of the world: first, (some) toads of the north |author=Naish, Darren |publisher=Tetrapod zoology |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> The underside is a dirty white speckled with grey and black patches.<ref name=Collins/><ref name=AmphibiaWeb>{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Bufo&where-species=bufo |title=''Bufo bufo'': Common toad |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=2012-05-04}}</ref>\n\nOther species with which the common toad could be confused include the [[natterjack toad]] (''Bufo calamita'') and the [[European green toad]] (''Bufo viridis'').
