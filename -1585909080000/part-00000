The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. While she is there, \u00c1ngel calls her phone, asking to speak with her in person. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. The police arrest her at the hospital moments after she tells \u00c1ngel that she knows where the Professor's hideout is, but will not tell them because she \"does not know who the good guys are\". \u00c1ngel is asked by Colonel Prieto where the Professor's hideout is, but he withholds the information. When Colonel Prieto threatens Raquel with several charges that would ensure her daughter taken away from her, she finally gives him the address of the hideout. The police race to the hideout. With the police inside the Mint, Berlin fights them off so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, although the Professor urges him to come. Berlin insistently continues and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape successfully from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police show up. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force, the robbers got away with about \u20ac1 billion and their whereabouts are still unknown.

Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the [[black market]] in [[Casablanca]] from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by [[Europol]]. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio.

Andr\u00e9s defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this. Having relied on mobile transportation and broadcasting, they become stuck when a tree breaks their antenna and the wheels sink in mud.

After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation\", the code phrase that confirms he is bugged. He instructs Tokyo to act normal in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working.

Raquel is discovered in the barn by a farmer and his wife, which begins a [[Mexican Standoff]] and a negotiation between Raquel and the farmers. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Afterwards, Sierra plans to use Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]], as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]. Su\u00e1rez and his men close in on Raquel's position as Raquel bargains with the farmers for her freedom by offering a reward greater than that of the police.

She rides a motorcycle directly into the Mint, avoiding being shot by police as Moscow opens the door.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 14\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n| Title           = A contrarreloj\n| AltTitle        = Against the Clock\n| DirectedBy      = Alejandro Bazzano\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Esther Mart\u00ednez Lobato, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, Pablo Roa, Fernando Sancrist\u00f3bal & David Barrocal\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|16|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 1.48<ref name=\"Premiere\" />\n| ShortSummary    = Moscow is gravely injured by a police gunshot after helping Tokyo return to the Mint and the police refuse to send aid. The robbers then rush to finish their escape tunnel. The Professor walks out of the villa at gunpoint by Raquel, but she is emotionally unable and unwilling to stop him from escaping. Colonel Prieto, Su\u00e1rez, and Alberto confront Raquel and remove her from the case after they identify the Professor as Salva (Sergio), who they believe Raquel is co-operating with due to signals made from local cell towers by calls from the Professor to Raquel. With her gun and badge taken away, she takes \u00c1ngel's [[badge]] and starts to conduct her own investigation by looking through surveillance footage of restaurants to determine the route the Professor had taken from his hideout.

The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. While she is there, \u00c1ngel calls her phone, asking to speak with her in person. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. The police arrest her at the hospital moments after she tells \u00c1ngel that she knows where the Professor's hideout is, but will not tell them because she \"does not know who the good guys are\". \u00c1ngel is asked by Colonel Prieto where the Professor's hideout is, but he withholds the information. When Colonel Prieto threatens Raquel with several charges that would ensure her daughter taken away from her, she finally gives him the address of the hideout. The police race to the hideout. With the police inside the Mint, Berlin fights them off so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, although the Professor urges him to come. Berlin insistently continues and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape successfully from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police show up. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force, the robbers got away with about \u20ac1 billion and their whereabouts are still unknown. Raquel looks at some postcards given to her previously by the Professor, which she notices has coordinates on them, and when pieced together give a location in [[Palawan]], Philippines. She travels there and finds the Professor and smiles.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019\u201320)===\n{{Episode table |background=#000000 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=15 |director=12 |writer=38 |airdate=25 |airdateR=<ref name=\"TFC\">{{cite web |title=Money Heist \u2013 Listings |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/la-casa-de-papel/listings/ |website=[[The Futon Critic]] |accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref> |aux1T=English title |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode table/part|p=3|c=#000000}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 16\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = Hemos vuelto\n| AltTitle        = We're Back\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Over two years after the heist, Arturo gives a talk to a large crowd condemning the fugitive members of the gang who held him and others hostage at the Mint as \"terrorists\". Meanwhile, Tokyo and Rio have relocated to [[Guna Yala]], Panama, Nairobi and Helsinki to [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], Argentina, and Denver, M\u00f3nica and her baby to [[Java]], Indonesia. Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the [[black market]] in [[Casablanca]] from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by [[Europol]]. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio. The professor enlists three new members, B\u00f3gota, Palermo and Marseille, into the gang and begins planning an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]].\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 17\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Aikido\n| AltTitle        = Aikido\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, Juan Salvador L\u00f3pez, Luis Moya, Alberto \u00dacar, David Barrocal\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = The Professor initiates the plan to rob the Bank of Spain using [[airships]] to release money across Madrid. The government responds by mobilizing the army, which the robbers use to provide cover and entry into the Bank. In flashbacks, the Professor recruits Mart\u00edn, an experienced thief and former associate to replace Berlin (Andr\u00e9s). The Professor and Mart\u00edn (now code named \"Palermo\") explain that their strategy for this robbery is based on ''[[Aikido]]'', a martial art that uses an enemy's force to create an advantage. As the robbers enter the Bank, public sentiment rallies to their side in the form of mass government protests and riots over the illegal imprisonment of Rio, demanding that he receive a public trial.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 18\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = 48 metros bajo el suelo\n| AltTitle        = 48 Meters Underground\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, Juan Salvador L\u00f3pez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = While commandeering the Bank, the robbers engage in a series of intense conflicts with guards and government officials.

B\u00f3gota, uses his expertise in diving and welding to overcome the lock down, granting access to the gold.

He reveals to Sierra the contents of the cases and that the Professor has the advantage\u2014an attack might force the robbers to make the secrets public. However, Sierra is able to unbalance the Professor and Raquel Murillo (now code-named \"Lisbon\"), with psychological taunting.

Andr\u00e9s defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this. Having relied on mobile transportation and broadcasting, they become stuck when a tree breaks their antenna and the wheels sink in mud. They narrowly escape detection with the help of some sympathetic local farmers. They then manage to inform the team of the breach 10 minutes before it happens, who defeat, capture, unclothe, and humiliate the breaching team by forcing them sing \"[[Bella ciao]]\" on video.

At the exchange, Rio is shocked by the massive crowds gathered in support of the robbers, wearing red jumpsuits and Dal\u00ed masks. The exchange proceeds smoothly and he rejoins the robbers. During the reunion, the police and government intelligence team listen in on their conversations, having planted a listening device inside Rio before releasing him. In flashbacks, the Professor instructs the team, preparing them to detect and remove these devices surgically from Rio, if the time comes. After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation\", the code phrase that confirms he is bugged. He instructs Tokyo to act normal in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working. Privately, Rio breaks up with Tokyo, believing that she will be better off with someone else. Nairobi surgically removes the listening device. The police manage to locate the Professor and Lisbon using a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]], forcing them to separate and try to escape on foot; the Professor camouflages himself in a tree, while Lisbon is unable, she takes shelter in a barn.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 23\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = La deriva\n| AltTitle        = Astray\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, \u00c1lex Pina, Almudena Ram\u00edrez-Pantanella, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Tokyo drinks herself into a semi-[[stupor]] as a result of her breakup and insults Rio as a coping mechanism for her emotional pain. In the forest, a massive manhunt begins for the Professor and Raquel. Raquel is discovered in the barn by a farmer and his wife, which begins a [[Mexican Standoff]] and a negotiation between Raquel and the farmers. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Afterwards, Sierra plans to use Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]], as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]. Su\u00e1rez and his men close in on Raquel's position as Raquel bargains with the farmers for her freedom by offering a reward greater than that of the police. Sierra brings Nairobi's son, Axel, in front of the bank, luring Nairobi to a window. Sierra gives the green light for a police sniper to shoot; Nairobi is shot in the chest. As the robbers scramble to aid an [[Exsanguination|exsanguinating]] Nairobi, the police begin the assault. In the forest, Su\u00e1rez and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] find Raquel and remove the farmers from the barn. The Professor hears gunshots over Raquel's microphone, and thinking she is executed, he becomes distraught. Palermo radios the Professor to inform him of the incoming assault and the Professor declares [[DEFCON]] 2, meaning war. Tokyo and Rio rush into firing position with [[RPG-7]]s and fire on the approaching armoured car, destroying it. It is revealed that Raquel is alive and in custody, with Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap, that Sierra had ordered Su\u00e1rez to fake an execution to elicit a drastic response, stating that \"the war had begun.\"\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|p=4|c=#2C6576}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 24\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Game Over\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 25\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n| Title           = Berlin's Wedding\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 26\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Anatomy Lesson\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 27\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n| Title           = Pasodoble\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = 5 Minutes Earlier\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 29\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n| Title           = TKO\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 30\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n| Title           = Strike the Tent\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 31\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n| Title           = The Paris Plan\n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Money Heist'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Money Heist episodes, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of crime drama television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Spanish television series episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Itechhacks1337", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added a legit citation to all brief of part 4.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Money_Heist_episodes"}

The senatorial districts consisted either of one or more entire counties; or a contiguous area within a single county. The counties which were divided into more than one senatorial district were New York (nine districts), Kings (eight), Bronx (three), Erie (three), Monroe (two), Queens (two) and Westchester (two). The Assembly districts were made up of contiguous area, all within the same county.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe New York state election, 1919, was held on November 4. No statewide elective offices were up for election. Two women were elected to the State Assembly: [[Elizabeth V. Gillette]] (Dem.), a physician, of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]]; and [[Marguerite L. Smith]] (Rep.), an athletics teacher, of [[Harlem]].\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the regular session at the State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 7, 1920. [[Thaddeus C. Sweet]] (R) was re-elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]].\n\nAt the beginning of the session, the five Socialist assemblymen were suspended by Speaker Sweet, pending a trial before the Assembly Committee on the Judiciary to determine whether they were fit to take their seats. [[Charles Evans Hughes]] (Rep.) and Governor [[Al Smith]] (Dem.) condemned Speaker Sweet and the Republican majority for taking this course of action.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/01/11/102736365.pdf ''SWEET DEFENDS ASSEMBLY'S ACTION''] in NYT on January 11, 1920</ref>\n\nOn March 30, a majority of 7 members of the 13-member Judiciary Committee recommended the expulsion the five Socialists. Minority reports recommended the seating of all or part of the Socialist assemblymen.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/03/31/102390157.pdf ''EXPEL THE FIVE SOCIALIST ASSEMBLYMEN, URGES MAJORITY REPORT, CHARGING TREASON; ROOSEVELT TO OPPOSE OUSTER MOTION''] in NYT on March 31, 1920</ref>\n\nIn the early morning of April 1, the five Socialist assemblymen were expelled.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/04/01/96877249.pdf ''DEMOCRATIC FILIBUSTERS DELAY VOTE ON EXPULSION OF SOCIALISTS IN STORMY DEBATE IN ASSEMBLY''] in NYT on April 1, 1920</ref>\n\nThe Legislature adjourned at 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, April 25, after a session of 37 hours.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/04/25/112656759.pdf ''LEGISLATURE ENDS AFTER 37\u2013HOUR SESSION; PASSES BEER AND ANTI-SOCIALIST BILLS; FAVORS TEACHERS' AND EX-SOLDIERS BONUS''] in NYT on April 25, 1920</ref> During this last session, Marguerite L.

The senatorial districts consisted either of one or more entire counties; or a contiguous area within a single county. The counties which were divided into more than one senatorial district were New York (nine districts), Kings (eight), Bronx (three), Erie (three), Monroe (two), Queens (two) and Westchester (two). The Assembly districts were made up of contiguous area, all within the same county.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe New York state election, 1919, was held on November 4. No statewide elective offices were up for election. Two women were elected to the State Assembly: [[Elizabeth V. Gillette]] (Dem.), a physician, of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]]; and [[Marguerite L. Smith]] (Rep.), an athletics teacher, of [[Harlem]].\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the regular session at the State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 7, 1920. [[Thaddeus C. Sweet]] (R) was re-elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]].\n\nAt the beginning of the session, the five Socialist assemblymen were suspended by Speaker Sweet, pending a trial before the Assembly Committee on the Judiciary to determine whether they were fit to take their seats. [[Charles Evans Hughes]] (Rep.) and Governor [[Al Smith]] (Dem.) condemned Speaker Sweet and the Republican majority for taking this course of action.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/01/11/102736365.pdf ''SWEET DEFENDS ASSEMBLY'S ACTION''] in NYT on January 11, 1920</ref>\n\nOn March 30, a majority of 7 members of the 13-member Judiciary Committee recommended the expulsion the five Socialists. Minority reports recommended the seating of all or part of the Socialist assemblymen.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/03/31/102390157.pdf ''EXPEL THE FIVE SOCIALIST ASSEMBLYMEN, URGES MAJORITY REPORT, CHARGING TREASON; ROOSEVELT TO OPPOSE OUSTER MOTION''] in NYT on March 31, 1920</ref>\n\nIn the early morning of April 1, the five Socialist assemblymen were expelled.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/04/01/96877249.pdf ''DEMOCRATIC FILIBUSTERS DELAY VOTE ON EXPULSION OF SOCIALISTS IN STORMY DEBATE IN ASSEMBLY''] in NYT on April 1, 1920</ref>\n\nThe Legislature adjourned at 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, April 25, after a session of 37 hours.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/04/25/112656759.pdf ''LEGISLATURE ENDS AFTER 37\u2013HOUR SESSION; PASSES BEER AND ANTI-SOCIALIST BILLS; FAVORS TEACHERS' AND EX-SOLDIERS BONUS''] in NYT on April 25, 1920</ref> During this last session, Marguerite L.

Al Smith called a special session of the Legislature for September 20, and ordered special elections to be held on September 16 to fill the vacancies caused by the expulsion of the Socialist members. The session was called to consider the housing situation in [[New York City]].<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/08/13/102885017.pdf ''GOVERNOR CALLS SPECIAL SESSION ON HOUSING CRISIS''] in NYT on August 13, 1920</ref>\n\nOn September 16, all five Socialists were re-elected to the Assembly.\n\nThe Legislature met for a special session at the State Capitol in Albany on September 20, 1920.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/09/21/100985093.pdf ''MOVE TO EXPEL SOCIALISTS AGAIN IS SIDETRACKED''] in NYT on September 21, 1920</ref>\n\nOn September 21, Claessens, Solomon and Waldman were again expelled, while DeWitt and Orr were permitted by a majority vote to take their seats.

A departure from her previous albums, it was more a heavily produced project featuring a full rock band sound (instead of Amos's usual minimalist piano sound). The album debuted at number 5 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 6 in the UK. While falling short of the number 2 debut for her previous album, ''[[Boys for Pele]]'' (1996), ''From the Choirgirl Hotel'' is Amos's strongest debut to date in US sales, selling 153,000 copies in the first week.<ref>{{cite magazine |title = Garth Boxes in Billboard 200's Top Slot |magazine = [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=951854| date=May 14, 1998| accessdate=1 June 2008}}</ref> As of 2008 it has sold 778,000 copies in US.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045442/ask-billboard |title=Ask Billboard|magazine=Billboard |date=2006-12-29 |accessdate=2020-03-02}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=March 2020}} In 1999, Amos received two [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations: Alternative Music Performance, and Female Rock Vocal Performance for \"[[Raspberry Swirl (song)|Raspberry Swirl]]\".\n\nThe lead single \"[[Spark (Tori Amos song)|Spark]]\" became a hit after its release in June 1998 (becoming her last UK Top 40 hit to date, as well as her highest charting US single, reaching number 49), and was followed by \"[[Jackie's Strength]]\" (September 1998) and \"[[Cruel (Tori Amos song)|Cruel]]\"/\"[[Raspberry Swirl]]\" (November 1998).\n\nThe accompanying tour, Amos's first with a full band (using the album's personnel of [[Matt Chamberlain]] on drums, Jon Evans on bass, and long-time collaborator Steve Caton on guitar), was known as the \"Plugged '98 Tour\" and took Amos through most of 1998.\n\n==Album description==\nThe album began recording in September 1997, with mastering complete by early February 1998.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul98/articles/toriamos.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601225156/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul98/articles/toriamos.html |archive-date=June 1, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Following the trend set by 1996's ''[[Boys For Pele]]'', Amos allowed several songs from the album to be remixed. Remixes of both \"Raspberry Swirl\" and \"Jackie's Strength\" were club hits. The album's theme dealt very closely with the first two in Amos's series of three [[miscarriage]]s between 1996 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web | title =  Vital Tori article from She Magazine in the UK \u2013 December 2003 | url =http://www.thedent.com/more.php?id=A1096_0_1_0_M}}</ref>\n\nThematically and conceptually, the \"choirgirl hotel\" of the title refers to the fictional, imaginary place where the songs \"live\". Amos pointed out that although the songs are recorded, they are also alive themselves \u2013 they can be re-modeled and reshaped in concert. Amos imagined the songs as living their own lives, all checking into the \"choirgirl hotel\" (i.e. the album) but living separate lives. In the artwork, Amos included a hand-drawn map detailing the stomping ground of these songs.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Tori, British Airways Highlife Magazine, |date=May 1998}}</ref>\n\nThe album artwork was created by the UK-based photographer, [[Katerina Jebb]].

A departure from her previous albums, it was more a heavily produced project featuring a full rock band sound (instead of Amos's usual minimalist piano sound). The album debuted at number 5 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 6 in the UK. While falling short of the number 2 debut for her previous album, ''[[Boys for Pele]]'' (1996), ''From the Choirgirl Hotel'' is Amos's strongest debut to date in US sales, selling 153,000 copies in the first week.<ref>{{cite magazine |title = Garth Boxes in Billboard 200's Top Slot |magazine = [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=951854| date=May 14, 1998| accessdate=1 June 2008}}</ref> As of 2008 it has sold 778,000 copies in US.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045442/ask-billboard |title=Ask Billboard|magazine=Billboard |date=2006-12-29 |accessdate=2020-03-02}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=March 2020}} In 1999, Amos received two [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations: Alternative Music Performance, and Female Rock Vocal Performance for \"[[Raspberry Swirl (song)|Raspberry Swirl]]\".\n\nThe lead single \"[[Spark (Tori Amos song)|Spark]]\" became a hit after its release in June 1998 (becoming her last UK Top 40 hit to date, as well as her highest charting US single, reaching number 49), and was followed by \"[[Jackie's Strength]]\" (September 1998) and \"[[Cruel (Tori Amos song)|Cruel]]\"/\"[[Raspberry Swirl]]\" (November 1998).\n\nThe accompanying tour, Amos's first with a full band (using the album's personnel of [[Matt Chamberlain]] on drums, Jon Evans on bass, and long-time collaborator Steve Caton on guitar), was known as the \"Plugged '98 Tour\" and took Amos through most of 1998.\n\n==Album description==\nThe album began recording in September 1997, with mastering complete by early February 1998.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul98/articles/toriamos.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601225156/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul98/articles/toriamos.html |archive-date=June 1, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Following the trend set by 1996's ''[[Boys For Pele]]'', Amos allowed several songs from the album to be remixed. Remixes of both \"Raspberry Swirl\" and \"Jackie's Strength\" were club hits. The album's theme dealt very closely with the first two in Amos's series of three [[miscarriage]]s between 1996 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web | title =  Vital Tori article from She Magazine in the UK \u2013 December 2003 | url =http://www.thedent.com/more.php?id=A1096_0_1_0_M}}</ref>\n\nThematically and conceptually, the \"choirgirl hotel\" of the title refers to the fictional, imaginary place where the songs \"live\". Amos pointed out that although the songs are recorded, they are also alive themselves \u2013 they can be re-modeled and reshaped in concert. Amos imagined the songs as living their own lives, all checking into the \"choirgirl hotel\" (i.e. the album) but living separate lives. In the artwork, Amos included a hand-drawn map detailing the stomping ground of these songs.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Tori, British Airways Highlife Magazine, |date=May 1998}}</ref>\n\nThe album artwork was created by the UK-based photographer, [[Katerina Jebb]].

The senatorial districts consisted either of one or more entire counties; or a contiguous area within a single county. The counties which were divided into more than one senatorial district were New York (nine districts), Kings (eight), Bronx (three), Erie (three), Monroe (two), Queens (two) and Westchester (two). The Assembly districts were made up of contiguous area, all within the same county.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], the [[Prohibition Party]] and the [[Socialist Labor Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York state election, 1918]], was held on November 5. This was the first election at which women had the right to vote, and the right to run for elective offices.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/10/27/97037793.pdf ''2,916,974 MAY VOTE IN NEW YORK STATE''] in NYT on October 27, 1918</ref> Two women were elected to the State Assembly: [[Ida B. Sammis]] (Rep.) and [[Mary M. Lilly]] (Dem.).\n\n[[Al Smith]] and [[Harry C. Walker]] were elected Governor and Lieutenant Governor, both Democrats. The incumbent Governor [[Charles S. Whitman]] ran on the Republican and the Prohibition tickets for re-election, but was defeated by Smith in a tight race, with a plurality of about 15,000 votes out of more than two million.\n\nThe other five statewide elective offices up for election were carried by the Republicans. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 1,010,000; Republicans 956,000; Socialists 122,000; Prohibition 39,000; and Socialist Labor 5,000.\n\nIn [[New York City]], where in November 1917 ten Socialists had been elected to the Assembly by pluralities in three-way races, Republicans and Democrats combined to stem the \"red flood\", and nominated joint candidates in most of the \"Socialist\" districts. Thus they managed to outpoll the Socialists in eight of the ten districts; only two Socialists, [[August Claessens]] and [[Charles Solomon (politician)|Charles Solomon]], managed to get elected.\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the regular session at the State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 1, 1919; and adjourned on April 19.\n\n[[Thaddeus C. Sweet]] (R) was re-elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]].\n\n[[J. Henry Walters]] (R) was elected President pro tempore of the State Senate.\n\nThe Legislature met for a special session at the State Capitol in Albany in the evening of June 16.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/06/11/97096263.pdf ''GOV. SMITH CALLS SUFFRAGE SESSION''] in NYT on June 11, 1919</ref> This session was called to ratify the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which established [[women's suffrage]]. The amendment was ratified by a vote of 44 to 0 in the Senate, and 137 to 0 in the Assembly. State Senator [[Henry M. Sage]]\u2014who was an outspoken opponent of women's suffrage\u2013was, on his request, excused from voting because \"he did not care to vote against it, but could not possibly vote to ratify.\" The Legislature also passed four bills concerning the housing situation in [[New York City]]; and adjourned after four hours.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/06/17/96314928.pdf ''WOMAN SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT WINS IN LEGISLATURE''] in NYT on June 17, 1919</ref>\n\n==State Senate==\n===Districts===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* 1st District: [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] counties\n* 2nd and 3rd District: Parts of Queens County, i.e the Borough of [[Queens]] \n* 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th District: Parts of Kings County, i.e. the Borough of [[Brooklyn]]\n* 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th District: Parts of New York County, i.e. the Borough of [[Manhattan]]\n* 21st, 22nd and 23rd District: Parts of Bronx County, i.e. the Borough of [[the Bronx]]\n* 24th District: Richmond County, i.e. the Borough of Richmond (now the Borough of [[Staten Island]]), and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]\n* 25th District: Part of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]\n* 26th District: [[Cortlandt, New York|Cortlandt]], [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]], [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]], [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]] and part of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]]; in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]\n* 27th District: [[Orange County, New York|Orange]] and [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan]] counties\n* 28th District: [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia]], [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]] and [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]] counties\n* 29th District: [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware]], [[Greene County, New York|Greene]] and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties\n* 30th District: [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]\n* 31st District: [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]]\n* 32nd District: [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga]] and [[Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady]] counties \n* 33rd District: [[Clinton County, New York|Clinton]], [[Essex County, New York|Essex]], [[Warren County, New York|Warren]] and [[Washington County, New York|Washington]] counties \n* 34th District: [[Franklin County, New York|Franklin]] and [[St. Lawrence County, New York|St. Lawrence]] counties\n* 35th District: [[Fulton County, New York|Fulton]], [[Hamilton County, New York|Hamilton]], [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer]] and [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis]] counties\n* 36th District: [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]]\n* 37th District: [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson]] and [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego]] counties\n* 38th District: [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]]\n* 39th District: [[Madison County, New York|Madison]], [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery]], [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego]] and [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie]] counties\n* 40th District: [[Broome County, New York|Broome]], [[Chenango County, New York|Chenango]] and [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland]] counties\n* 41st District: [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung]], [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]], [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga]] and [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins]] counties\n* 42nd District: [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga]], [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne]] counties\n* 43rd District: [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]] and [[Yates County, New York|Yates]] counties\n* 44th District: [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]] and [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]]\n* 45th and 46th District: [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]]\n* 47th District: [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]] and [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]] counties\n* 48th, 49th and 50th District: [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]]\n* 51st District: [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]] and [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]] counties}}\n\n===Members===\nThe asterisk (*) denotes members of the previous Legislature who continued in office as members of this Legislature.

The senatorial districts consisted either of one or more entire counties; or a contiguous area within a single county. The counties which were divided into more than one senatorial district were New York (nine districts), Kings (eight), Bronx (three), Erie (three), Monroe (two), Queens (two) and Westchester (two). The Assembly districts were made up of contiguous area, all within the same county.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], the [[Prohibition Party]] and the [[Socialist Labor Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York state election, 1918]], was held on November 5. This was the first election at which women had the right to vote, and the right to run for elective offices.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/10/27/97037793.pdf ''2,916,974 MAY VOTE IN NEW YORK STATE''] in NYT on October 27, 1918</ref> Two women were elected to the State Assembly: [[Ida B. Sammis]] (Rep.) and [[Mary M. Lilly]] (Dem.).\n\n[[Al Smith]] and [[Harry C. Walker]] were elected Governor and Lieutenant Governor, both Democrats. The incumbent Governor [[Charles S. Whitman]] ran on the Republican and the Prohibition tickets for re-election, but was defeated by Smith in a tight race, with a plurality of about 15,000 votes out of more than two million.\n\nThe other five statewide elective offices up for election were carried by the Republicans. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 1,010,000; Republicans 956,000; Socialists 122,000; Prohibition 39,000; and Socialist Labor 5,000.\n\nIn [[New York City]], where in November 1917 ten Socialists had been elected to the Assembly by pluralities in three-way races, Republicans and Democrats combined to stem the \"red flood\", and nominated joint candidates in most of the \"Socialist\" districts. Thus they managed to outpoll the Socialists in eight of the ten districts; only two Socialists, [[August Claessens]] and [[Charles Solomon (politician)|Charles Solomon]], managed to get elected.\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the regular session at the State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 1, 1919; and adjourned on April 19.\n\n[[Thaddeus C. Sweet]] (R) was re-elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]].\n\n[[J. Henry Walters]] (R) was elected President pro tempore of the State Senate.\n\nThe Legislature met for a special session at the State Capitol in Albany in the evening of June 16.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/06/11/97096263.pdf ''GOV. SMITH CALLS SUFFRAGE SESSION''] in NYT on June 11, 1919</ref> This session was called to ratify the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which established [[women's suffrage]]. The amendment was ratified by a vote of 44 to 0 in the Senate, and 137 to 0 in the Assembly. State Senator [[Henry M. Sage]]\u2014who was an outspoken opponent of women's suffrage\u2013was, on his request, excused from voting because \"he did not care to vote against it, but could not possibly vote to ratify.\" The Legislature also passed four bills concerning the housing situation in [[New York City]]; and adjourned after four hours.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/06/17/96314928.pdf ''WOMAN SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT WINS IN LEGISLATURE''] in NYT on June 17, 1919</ref>\n\n==State Senate==\n===Districts===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* 1st District: [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] counties\n* 2nd and 3rd District: Parts of Queens County, i.e the Borough of [[Queens]] \n* 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th District: Parts of Kings County, i.e. the Borough of [[Brooklyn]]\n* 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th District: Parts of New York County, i.e. the Borough of [[Manhattan]]\n* 21st, 22nd and 23rd District: Parts of Bronx County, i.e. the Borough of [[the Bronx]]\n* 24th District: Richmond County, i.e. the Borough of Richmond (now the Borough of [[Staten Island]]), and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]\n* 25th District: Part of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]\n* 26th District: [[Cortlandt, New York|Cortlandt]], [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]], [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]], [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]] and part of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]]; in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]\n* 27th District: [[Orange County, New York|Orange]] and [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan]] counties\n* 28th District: [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia]], [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]] and [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]] counties\n* 29th District: [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware]], [[Greene County, New York|Greene]] and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties\n* 30th District: [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]\n* 31st District: [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]]\n* 32nd District: [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga]] and [[Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady]] counties \n* 33rd District: [[Clinton County, New York|Clinton]], [[Essex County, New York|Essex]], [[Warren County, New York|Warren]] and [[Washington County, New York|Washington]] counties \n* 34th District: [[Franklin County, New York|Franklin]] and [[St. Lawrence County, New York|St. Lawrence]] counties\n* 35th District: [[Fulton County, New York|Fulton]], [[Hamilton County, New York|Hamilton]], [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer]] and [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis]] counties\n* 36th District: [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]]\n* 37th District: [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson]] and [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego]] counties\n* 38th District: [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]]\n* 39th District: [[Madison County, New York|Madison]], [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery]], [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego]] and [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie]] counties\n* 40th District: [[Broome County, New York|Broome]], [[Chenango County, New York|Chenango]] and [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland]] counties\n* 41st District: [[Chemung County, New York|Chemung]], [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]], [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga]] and [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins]] counties\n* 42nd District: [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga]], [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne]] counties\n* 43rd District: [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]] and [[Yates County, New York|Yates]] counties\n* 44th District: [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]] and [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]]\n* 45th and 46th District: [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]]\n* 47th District: [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]] and [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]] counties\n* 48th, 49th and 50th District: [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]]\n* 51st District: [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]] and [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]] counties}}\n\n===Members===\nThe asterisk (*) denotes members of the previous Legislature who continued in office as members of this Legislature.

Whitman]]'s [[Governor of New York|governorship]], in [[Albany, New York|Albany]].\n\n==Background==\nUnder the provisions of the [[New York Constitution]] of 1894, re-apportioned in 1917, 51 Senators and 150 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts; senators for a two-year term, assemblymen for a one-year term. The senatorial districts were made up of entire counties, except New York County (twelve districts), Kings County (eight districts), Erie County (three districts) and Monroe County (two districts). The Assembly districts were made up of contiguous area, all within the same county.\n\nIn 1917, the Legislature redistricted the Senate seats,<ref>For the exact boundaries of the senate districts see [https://archive.org/stream/manualforuseleg01unkngoog#page/n599/mode/1up ''Manual for the Use of the Legislature''] (1921; pg. 549\u2013560)</ref> and re-apportioned the number of assemblymen per county. [[Bronx County]]\u2014which had been part of New York County at the time of the previous apportionment and occupied roughly the area of four Assembly districts\u2014was properly separated, and was apportioned eight seats. New York County (without the Bronx) lost eight seats; and Erie, Jefferson and Ulster counties lost one seat each. Queens County gained two seats; and Broome, Nassau, Richmond, Schenectady and Westchester counties gained one seat each.<ref>For the number of assemblymen per county, and the exact boundaries of the Assembly districts, see [https://archive.org/stream/manualforuseleg01unkngoog#page/n644/mode/1up ''Manual for the Use of the Legislature''] (1921; pg. 596\u2013633)</ref>\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] and the [[Prohibition Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York state election, 1917]], was held on November 6. The three statewide elective offices up for election were carried by the three incumbents: Attorney General [[Merton E. Lewis]] and two cross-endorsed judges of the [[New York Court of Appeals]], ''viz.'' Democrat [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] and Republican [[Chester B. McLaughlin]]. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Attorney General, was: Republicans 697,000; Democrats 542,000; Socialists 169,000 and Prohibition 26,000.\n\nAlso, a constitutional amendment was adopted by the voters, which gave women the right to vote.\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the regular session at the State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 2, 1918; and adjourned on April 13.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/04/14/112638928.pdf ''LEGISLATURE ENDS SESSION FOR YEAR''] in NYT on April 14, 1918</ref>\n\n[[Thaddeus C.

Whitman]]'s [[Governor of New York|governorship]], in [[Albany, New York|Albany]].\n\n==Background==\nUnder the provisions of the [[New York Constitution]] of 1894, re-apportioned in 1917, 51 Senators and 150 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts; senators for a two-year term, assemblymen for a one-year term. The senatorial districts were made up of entire counties, except New York County (twelve districts), Kings County (eight districts), Erie County (three districts) and Monroe County (two districts). The Assembly districts were made up of contiguous area, all within the same county.\n\nIn 1917, the Legislature redistricted the Senate seats,<ref>For the exact boundaries of the senate districts see [https://archive.org/stream/manualforuseleg01unkngoog#page/n599/mode/1up ''Manual for the Use of the Legislature''] (1921; pg. 549\u2013560)</ref> and re-apportioned the number of assemblymen per county. [[Bronx County]]\u2014which had been part of New York County at the time of the previous apportionment and occupied roughly the area of four Assembly districts\u2014was properly separated, and was apportioned eight seats. New York County (without the Bronx) lost eight seats; and Erie, Jefferson and Ulster counties lost one seat each. Queens County gained two seats; and Broome, Nassau, Richmond, Schenectady and Westchester counties gained one seat each.<ref>For the number of assemblymen per county, and the exact boundaries of the Assembly districts, see [https://archive.org/stream/manualforuseleg01unkngoog#page/n644/mode/1up ''Manual for the Use of the Legislature''] (1921; pg. 596\u2013633)</ref>\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] and the [[Prohibition Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York state election, 1917]], was held on November 6. The three statewide elective offices up for election were carried by the three incumbents: Attorney General [[Merton E. Lewis]] and two cross-endorsed judges of the [[New York Court of Appeals]], ''viz.'' Democrat [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] and Republican [[Chester B. McLaughlin]]. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Attorney General, was: Republicans 697,000; Democrats 542,000; Socialists 169,000 and Prohibition 26,000.\n\nAlso, a constitutional amendment was adopted by the voters, which gave women the right to vote.\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the regular session at the State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 2, 1918; and adjourned on April 13.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/04/14/112638928.pdf ''LEGISLATURE ENDS SESSION FOR YEAR''] in NYT on April 14, 1918</ref>\n\n[[Thaddeus C. Sweet]] (R) was re-elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]], with 88 votes against 33 for [[Charles D. Donohue]] (D) and 9 for [[Abraham I.
