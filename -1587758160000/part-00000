In 1992, it was adapted in the [[Indian cinema|Indian film]] [[Ek Ladka Ek Ladki]], in 2006, it was adapted into the South Korean television series ''[[Couple or Trouble]]'' and in 2018 it was [[Overboard (2018 film)|remade]] with [[Anna Faris]] and [[Eugenio Derbez]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nHeiress Joanna Stayton is accustomed to a wealthy life with her husband, Grant Stayton III. While waiting for their yacht to be repaired in the rural hamlet of Elk Cove, Oregon, she hires local carpenter Dean Proffitt to remodel her closet. He puts up with her rude and condescending attitude, and produces quality work, which is dismissed by her because he used [[oak]] instead of [[cedar wood|cedar]], despite her not having specifically requested this at the start.\n\nHe agrees to redo the closet, if he is paid for the work he has already done. She refuses to pay and they have an argument, during which he notes that she is inventing things to complain about because her life is so pampered and boring. This is overheard by the yacht's crew on the [[intercom]], who applaud him for telling her off. Their argument concludes with her pushing him off the yacht and throwing his tools into the ocean.\n\nThat night, as the yacht sails away, Joanna goes on deck to retrieve her wedding ring; she suddenly loses her balance and falls overboard. The next day, a story is aired on the local TV news about her having been picked out of the water by a [[garbage scow]]. She is suffering from [[amnesia]], and is taken to the local hospital, where no one can determine her identity. Once Grant discovers that she has fallen overboard, he sails back to retrieve her. After seeing her mental state and her lashing out at hospital employees, he denies knowing her, and returns to the yacht to embark on a spree of parties with younger women.\n\nAfter seeing her story on the news, Dean, who is a widower living in squalor with four sons, seeks revenge by encouraging Joanna to [[debt bondage|work off her unpaid bill]]. Despite pleas from his best friend, Billy, not to follow through on his impulse, he goes to the hospital and tells her that she is Annie, his wife of thirteen years and the mother of his four sons. She reluctantly goes home with him and is appalled by his residence.\n\nJoanna initially has difficulty dealing with Dean's sons and the heavy load of chores, but she soon adapts. As she masters her responsibilities, she learns about the boys' school and family issues, and that Dean is secretly working two jobs to pay bills. She falls in love with him and develops motherly love toward his sons, and starts streamlining the money problems with more efficient budgeting. Joanna also convinces Dean to be a father to his sons rather than simply be their friend, as his sons are doing poorly in school and struggle with literacy, yet he simply brushes these issues aside rather than fix them.\n\nJoanna makes Dean's dream come true by helping him design a [[miniature golf]] course. Although he has also fallen in love with her, he does not tell her the truth about her real identity for fear that she will leave. Billy, who created doctored photos of the couple to cement the alibi of their marriage, tells Dean that his family needs Joanna.\n\nJoanna's mother, Edith, learns that Grant abandoned Joanna at the hospital and has been lying to her about her daughter's condition. After Edith threatens Grant (who is in [[Los Angeles]]) that she will hire mercenaries to hunt him down, he reluctantly ends the partying and returns to Elk Cove to retrieve Joanna, whose memory is instantaneously restored upon seeing him. She is shocked and hurt when she realizes that Dean lied and has been using her for months, and returns with Grant to their yacht, which is headed for [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nJoanna now finds her old lifestyle boring and pretentious. She is particularly offended by how rude and haughtily Grant and Edith treat the boat staff. She apologizes to her butler, Andrew, for her spiteful treatment of him over the years. He then helps Joanna to realize how happy she was with Dean and his sons. Joanna commandeers the yacht and turns back towards Elk Cove. The next morning when Grant finds out that Joanna loves Dean and wants to return back to the life she had before regaining her memory, Grant becomes insane and takes charge of the boat; Joanna reveals she doesn't love him anymore, and Grant reveals that he purposely abandoned her and had numerous affairs with other women in her absence. Dean and the boys arrive on a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] boat with the intention of rescuing Joanna, but they are soon called away due to a sighting of salmon poachers. Dean grabs a life jacket and dives into the water towards the yacht and Joanna does likewise before letting Andrew know to tell her mother that she'll give her a phone call. Grant, now having a mental breakdown, furiously takes aim at her with a [[bow and arrow]], only to be purposely booted overboard into the water by Andrew, who then gives his two weeks [[Notice period|notice]]. After reuniting, Joanna tells Dean that all of the money and the yacht is actually hers, not Grant's. As the boys eagerly make out their [[Wish list|Christmas lists]], Dean asks Joanna what he could possibly give her that she doesn't already have. Joanna smiles and replies, \"A little girl.\" The film ends with Dean and Joanna kissing as the boat sails off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Joanna Stayton/Annie Proffitt\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Dean Proffitt\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as Grant Stayton III\n* [[Katherine Helmond]] as Edith Mintz\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as Andrew\n* [[Michael G.

While waiting for their yacht to be repaired in the rural hamlet of Elk Cove, Oregon, she hires local carpenter Dean Proffitt to remodel her closet. He puts up with her rude and condescending attitude, and produces quality work, which is dismissed by her because he used [[oak]] instead of [[cedar wood|cedar]], despite her not having specifically requested this at the start.\n\nHe agrees to redo the closet, if he is paid for the work he has already done. She refuses to pay and they have an argument, during which he notes that she is inventing things to complain about because her life is so pampered and boring. This is overheard by the yacht's crew on the [[intercom]], who applaud him for telling her off. Their argument concludes with her pushing him off the yacht and throwing his tools into the ocean.\n\nThat night, as the yacht sails away, Joanna goes on deck to retrieve her wedding ring; she suddenly loses her balance and falls overboard.

Torture, by definition, is a [[mens rea|knowing and intentional act]]; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict suffering or pain, without a specific intent to do so, are not typically considered torture.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/23038/9-insane-torture-techniques |title = 9 Insane Torture Techniques|date = 19 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nTorture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals, groups, and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day, and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or longer. Reasons for torture can include [[punishment]], [[revenge]], [[extortion]], [[persuasion]], political [[Brainwashing|re-education]], [[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[coercion]] of the victim or a third party, [[interrogation]] to extract information or a [[confession]] irrespective of whether it is [[false confession|false]], or simply the [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] gratification of those carrying out or observing the torture.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.losangelescriminallawyer.pro/california-penal-code-section-206-pc-torture.html | title=California Penal Code Section 206 PC: Torture}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.shouselaw.com/torture.html |title = Penal Code 206 \u2013 the crime of \"Torture\" in California law}}</ref> Alternatively, some forms of torture are designed to inflict [[Psychological torture|psychological pain]] or leave as little physical injury or evidence as possible while achieving the same psychological devastation. The torturer may or may not kill or injure the victim, but torture may result in a [[murder|deliberate death]] and serves as a form of [[capital punishment]]. Depending on the aim, even a form of torture that is intentionally fatal may be prolonged to allow the victim to suffer as long as possible (such as [[half-hanging]]). In other cases, the torturer may be indifferent to the condition of the victim.\n\nAlthough torture is sanctioned by some states, it is prohibited under [[international law]] and the [[domestic laws]] of most countries. Although widely illegal and reviled, there is an ongoing debate as to what exactly is and is not legally defined as torture. It is a serious violation of [[human rights]], and is declared to be unacceptable (but not illegal) by Article 5 of the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and the [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 8 June 1977 officially agree not to torture captured persons in [[armed conflicts]], whether international or internal. Torture is also prohibited for the signatories of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], which has 163 state parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-9&chapter=4&lang=en |title= United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nNational and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical, and information obtained by torture is far less reliable than that obtained by other techniques.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/014/2005/en |title=Torture and Ill-Treatment in the 'War on Terror' |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=22 October 2008 }}</ref><ref name=general/><ref name=reckoning/> Despite these findings and international conventions, organizations that monitor abuses of human rights (e.g., [[Amnesty International]], the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]], [[Freedom from Torture]], etc.) report widespread use condoned by states in many regions of the world.<ref>[[Amnesty International]] [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol10/001/2005/en/ Report 2005]  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070317170847/http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/2af-summary-eng Report 2006]</ref> Amnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some of them openly.<ref name=\"Amnesty08\">{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |title=Report 08: At a Glance |year=2008 |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202906/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |archivedate = 8 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===International level===\n\n====UN Convention Against Torture====\nThe [[United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], which is currently in force since 26 June 1987, provides a broad definition of torture. Article 1.1 of the UN Convention Against Torture reads:\n{{blockquote|For the purpose of this Convention, the term \"torture\" means any act by which severe [[pain]] or [[suffering]], whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him, or a third person, information or a [[Confession (law)|confession]], punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or [[intimidating]] or [[Coercion|coercing]] him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a [[public official]] or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm|title=A/RES/39/46. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|website=un.org}}</ref>}}\n\nThis definition was restricted to apply only to nations and to government-sponsored torture and clearly limits the torture to that perpetrated, directly or indirectly, by those acting in an official capacity, such as [[government agency|government personnel]], [[law enforcement officers|law enforcement personnel]], [[medical personnel]], [[military personnel]], or [[politicians]]. It appears to exclude:\n# torture perpetrated by [[gang]]s, [[hate group]]s, [[rebellion|rebel]]s, or [[terrorist]]s who ignore national or international mandates;\n# random violence during war; and\n# punishment allowed by national laws, even if the punishment uses techniques similar to those used by torturers such as [[mutilation]], [[flagellation|whipping]], or [[corporal punishment]] when practiced as [[criminal justice|lawful punishment]]. Some professionals in the torture rehabilitation field believe that this definition is too restrictive and that the definition of politically motivated torture should be broadened to include all acts of organized violence.<ref>James Jaranson, \"The Science and Politics of Rehabilitating Torture Survivors,\" in ''Caring for Victims of Torture,'' edited by Michael K. Popkin, Amer Psychiatric Pub Inc.1998.</ref>\n\n====Declaration of Tokyo====\n\nAn even broader definition was used in the 1975 [[Declaration of Tokyo]] regarding the participation of medical professionals in acts of torture:\n\n:For the purpose of this Declaration, torture is defined as the deliberate, systematic or wanton infliction of physical or mental suffering by one or more persons acting alone or on the orders of any authority, to force another person to yield information, to make a confession, or for any other reason.<ref>[http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html World Medical Association, ''Declaration of Tokyo,'' 1975.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218203758/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html |date=18 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThis definition includes torture as part of [[domestic violence]] or ritualistic abuse, as well as in criminal activities.\n\n====Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court====\nThe [[Rome Statute]] is the [[treaty]] that set up the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). The treaty was adopted at a diplomatic conference in Rome on 17 July 1998 and went into effect on 1 July 2002. The Rome Statute provides the simplest definition of torture regarding the prosecution of [[war criminals]] by the International Criminal Court. Paragraph 1 under Article 7(e) of the Rome Statute provides that:\n\n{{quote|\"Torture\" means the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions;<ref>[http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm ROME STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT], INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, 17 July 1998.</ref>}}\n\n====Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture====\n\nThe [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]], which is in force since 28 February 1987, defines torture more expansively than the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Article 2 of the Inter-American Convention reads:\n\n{{quote|For the purposes of this Convention, torture shall be understood to be any act intentionally performed whereby physical or mental pain or suffering is inflicted on a person for purposes of a criminal investigation, as a means of intimidation, as personal punishment, as a preventive measure, as a penalty, or for any other purpose. Torture shall also be understood to be the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish.\n\nThe concept of torture shall not include physical or mental pain or suffering that is inherent in or solely the consequence of lawful measures, provided that they do not include the performance of the acts or use of the methods referred to in this article.<ref name=\"autogenerated1985\">[http://www.oas.org/juridico/English/Treaties/a-51.html Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture], Organization of American States, 9 December 1985.</ref>}}\n\n====Amnesty International====\n\nSince 1973, [[Amnesty International]] has adopted the simplest, broadest definition of torture. It reads:\n\n:Torture is the systematic and deliberate infliction of acute pain by one person on another, or on a third person, in order to accomplish the purpose of the former against the will of the latter.<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act40/001/1984/en/ Amnesty International, (1973) ''Torture in the Eighties.'' USA Edition.

Torture grew into an ornate discipline, where calibrated violence served two functions: to investigate and produce confessions and to attack the body as a form of punishment. Entire populaces of towns would show up to witness an execution by torture in the public square. Those who had been \"spared\" torture were commonly locked barefooted into the stocks, where children took delight in rubbing feces into their hair and mouths.<ref>G. R. Scott, ''A History of Torture'' (London: Merchant, 1995).</ref>\n\nDeliberately painful methods of torture and execution for severe crimes were taken for granted as part of justice until the development of [[Humanism]] in [[17th-century philosophy]], and \"[[cruel and unusual punishment]]\" came to be denounced in the [[English Bill of Rights]] of 1689. The [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the [[Western world]] further developed the idea of universal [[human rights]]. The adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 marks the recognition at least nominally of a general ban of torture by all UN member states.\n\nIts effect in practice is limited, however, as the Declaration is not ratified officially and does not have a legally binding character in international law, but is rather considered part of [[customary international law]]. Several countries still practice torture today. Some countries have legally codified it, and others have claimed that it is not practiced while maintaining the use of torture in secret.<ref>\"Nigeria's Torture Chambers Exposed in New Report.\" ''Amnesty''.

Hirsch, ''ed''., ''The Book of Torture and Executions'' (Toronto: Golden Books, 1944).</ref> ''First-degree'' torture typically took the forms of whipping and beating but did not mutilate the body. The most prevalent modern example is [[bastinado]], a technique of beating or whipping the soles of the bare feet. ''Second-degree'' torture consisted almost entirely of crushing devices and procedures, including screw presses or \"bone vises\" that crushed thumbs, toes, knees, feet, even teeth and skulls in a wide variety of ways. A wide array of [[Boot (torture)|\"boots\"]]\u2014-machines designed to slowly crush feet\u2014-are representative. Finally, ''third-degree'' tortures savagely mutilated the body in numerous dreadful ways, incorporating spikes, blades, boiling oil, and controlled fire. The serrated iron tongue shredder; the red-hot copper basin for destroying eyesight ([[abacination]], ''q.v.''); and the stocks that forcibly held the prisoner's naked feet, glistening with lard, directly over red-hot coals ([[foot roasting]], ''q.v.'') until the skin and foot muscles were burnt black and the bones fell to ashes are examples of torture in the third degree.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:Flaying of rebels.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Assyria]]ns skinning or flaying their prisoners alive]]\nJudicial torture was probably first applied in Persia, either by [[Medes]] or [[Achaemenid Empire]].

Torture was deemed a legitimate means to extract confessions or to obtain the names of accomplices or other information about a crime, although many confessions were greatly invalid due to the victim being forced to confess under great agony and pressure. It was permitted by law only if there was already [[half-proof]] against the accused.<ref>J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal''.

Torture in the [[Medieval Inquisition]] began in 1252 with a papal bull [[Ad extirpanda|Ad Extirpanda]] and ended in 1816 when another [[papal bull]] forbade its use.\n\nA highly esteemed torture in the times of the Inquisition as a good means of interrogating \"taciturn\" heretics and wizards was the interrogation chair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/#portfolio|title=Please visit our colleagues in Bruges!|website=torturemuseumamsterdam.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133744/http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/#portfolio|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nTorture was usually conducted in secret, in underground dungeons. By contrast, torturous executions were typically public, and woodcuts of English prisoners being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] show large crowds of spectators, as do paintings of Spanish [[auto-da-f\u00e9]] executions, in which heretics were burned at the stake. Torture was also used during this time period as a means of reform, spectacle, to induce fear into the public, and most popularly as a punishment for treason.\n\nMedieval torture devices were varied. One old English chronicle from the Early Medieval period reads, \"They hanged them by the thumbs, or by the head, and hung fires on their feet; they put knotted strings about their heads and writhed them so that it went to the brain ... Some they put in a chest that was short, and narrow, and shallow, and put sharp stones therein, and pressed the man therein so that they broke all his limbs ...

Limb-smashing and drowning were also popular medieval tortures. Specific devices were also created and used during this time, including the rack, the Pear (also mentioned in Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811) as \"Choak [''sic.''] Pears,\" and described as being \"formerly used in Holland.\"), [[thumbscrew (torture)|thumbscrew]]s, animals like rats, the [[iron chair]], and the [[cat o nine tails]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5402/5402.txt | title=1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue}}</ref>\n\n===Early modern period===\n\nDuring the early modern period, the [[torture of witches]] took place. In 1613, [[Anton Praetorius]] described the situation of the prisoners in the dungeons in his book ''Gr\u00fcndlicher Bericht Von Zauberey und Zauberern'' (''Thorough Report about Sorcery and Sorcerers''). He was one of the first to protest against all means of torture.\n\nWhile secular courts often treated suspects ferociously, [[Will Durant|Will]] and Ariel Durant argued in ''The Age of Faith'' that many of the most vicious procedures were inflicted upon pious [[heresy|heretics]] by even more pious friars. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] gained a reputation as some of the most fearsomely innovative torturers in medieval Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiir.eu/international-law/international-human-rights-treaties/torture-and-impunity|title=Torture and Impunity|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=EIIR|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\nTorture was continued by [[Protestants]] during the [[Renaissance]] against teachers who they viewed as [[Heresy|heretics]].

For this reason, in England, a regularized system of judicial torture never existed and its use was limited to political cases. Torture was in theory not permitted under English law, but in [[Tudors|Tudor]] and early [[Stuarts|Stuart]] times, under certain conditions, torture was used in England. For example, the confession of [[Marc Smeaton]] at the trial of [[Anne Boleyn]] was presented in written form only, either to hide from the court that Smeaton had been tortured on [[Rack (torture)|the rack]] for four hours, or because [[Thomas Cromwell]] was worried that he would recant his confession if cross-examined. When [[Guy Fawkes]] was arrested for his role in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605 he was tortured until he revealed all he knew about the plot. This was not so much to extract a confession, which was not needed to prove his guilt, but to extract from him the names of his fellow conspirators. By this time torture was not routine in England and a special warrant from King [[James I of England|James I]] was needed before he could be tortured. The wording of the warrant shows some concerns for humanitarian considerations, specifying that the severity of the methods of interrogation were to be increased only gradually until the interrogators were sure that Fawkes had told all he knew.\n[[File:Nabijanje na kolac igumana Pajsija.JPG|thumb|[[Impalement]] of Serbian [[Had\u017ei-Prodan's rebellion|rebel leaders]] in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman-ruled Serbia]] in 1814]]\n\nThe [[privy council]] attempted to have [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]] who stabbed [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] to death in 1628 questioned under torture on the rack, but the judges resisted, unanimously declaring its use to be contrary to the [[English law|laws of England]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Jardine|first=David|authorlink=David Jardine (barrister)|title=A Reading on the Use of Torture in the Criminal Law of England|url=https://archive.org/details/areadingonuseto01jardgoog|publisher=Baldwin and Cradock|location=London|year=1837|pages=[https://archive.org/details/areadingonuseto01jardgoog/page/n28 10]\u201312}}</ref> Torture was abolished in England around 1640 (except ''[[peine forte et dure]]'', which was abolished in 1772).\n\nIn [[Colonial America]], women were sentenced to the [[stocks]] with wooden clips on their tongues or subjected to the \"[[dunking stool]]\" for the gender-specific crime of talking too much.<ref>Brizendine, Louann ''The Female Brain'' Broadway Books.

[[Johann Graefe]] in 1624 published ''Tribunal Reformation'', a case against torture. [[Cesare Beccaria]], an Italian lawyer, published in 1764 \"An Essay on Crimes and Punishments\", in which he argued that torture unjustly punished the innocent and should be unnecessary in proving guilt. [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778) also fiercely condemned torture in some of his essays.\n\nWhile in Egypt in 1798, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] wrote to Major-General Berthier regarding the validity of torture as an interrogation tool:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe barbarous custom of whipping men suspected of having important secrets to reveal must be abolished. It has always been recognized that this method of interrogation, by putting men to the torture, is useless. The wretches say whatever comes into their heads and whatever they think one wants to believe. Consequently, the Commander-in-Chief forbids the use of a method which is contrary to reason and humanity.<ref>Napoleon Bonaparte, ''Letters and Documents of Napoleon, Volume I: The Rise to Power'', selected and translated by John Eldred Howard (London: The Cresset Press, 1961), 274.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nEuropean states abolished torture from their statutory law in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

The echelle more commonly known as the \"ladder\" or \"rack\" was a long table that the accused would lie upon and be stretched violently. The torture was used so intensely that on many occasions the victim's limbs would be pulled out of the socket and, at times, the limbs would even be torn from the body entirely. On some special occasions a tortillon was used in conjunction with the ladder which would severely squeeze and mutilate the genitals at the same time as the stretching was occurring.<ref name=\"HRTR p120\"/> Similar to the ladder was the \"lift\". It too stretched the limbs of the accused; in this instance however the victim's feet were strapped to the ground and their arms were tied behind their back before a rope was tied to their hands and lifted upwards. This caused the arms to break before the portion of the stretching began.<ref name=\"HRTR p121\"/> Finally, the judicial system of King James favored the use of the turkas, an ingenious and savage iron instrument for destroying the nails of the fingers and toes. The sharp point of the instrument was first pushed under the nail to the root, splitting the nail down the centerline. Pincers then grabbed either edge of the destroyed nail and slowly tore it away from the nail bed.  Other common tortures included the strappado, a system of weights and pulleys with which the prisoner was trussed up and jerked in order to dislocate his limbs; the water torture, by which he was maintained at the very edge of drowning; and the so-called torture by fire, in which the bare feet, immobilized in iron stocks and smeared with lard, were slowly barbecued over red-hot coals.\n\n===Since 1948===\n[[File:Buchenwald Eisenhower torture demonstration 63511.jpg|thumb|Survivors of the [[Ohrdruf concentration camp]] demonstrate torture methods used in the camp]]\n{{Main|Use of torture since 1948}}\n\nModern sensibilities have been shaped by a profound reaction to the [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] committed by the [[Axis Powers]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] in the [[Second World War]], which have led to a sweeping international rejection of most if not all aspects of the practice.<ref>Elihu Lauterpacht, C.

According to apocryphal lore, ''l\u00edng che'' began when the torturer, wielding an extremely sharp knife, began by putting out the eyes, rendering the condemned incapable of seeing the remainder of the torture and, presumably, adding considerably to the psychological terror of the procedure. Successive rather minor cuts chopped off ears, nose, tongue, fingers, toes, and such before proceeding to grosser cuts that removed large collops of flesh from more sizable parts, e.g., thighs and shoulders. The entire process was said to last three days, and to total 3,600 cuts. The heavily carved bodies of the deceased were then put on a parade for a show in the public. More typical was to bribe the executioner to administer hasty death to the victim after a small number of dramatic slices inflicted for showmanship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|title=Death by a Thousand Cuts at Chinese Arts Centre until 23rd March|website=manchestereventsguide.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418031632/http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|archivedate=18 April 2009}}</ref><ref>Lamb, H.

The penetration can be through the sides, from the [[rectum]], or through the [[Human mouth|mouth]] or [[vagina]]. This method would lead to slow, painful, death. Often, the victim was hoisted into the air after partial impalement. Gravity and the victim's own struggles would cause him to slide down the pole. Death could take many days. Impalement was frequently practiced in Asia and Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Vlad III Dracula]] and [[Ivan the Terrible]] have passed into legend as major users of the method.<ref>[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9382120/Dracula Dracula \u2013 Britannica Concise] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThe ''breaking wheel'' was a torturous [[capital punishment]] device used in the [[Middle Ages]] and early modern times for public execution by [[Club (weapon)|cudgeling]] to death, especially in France and Germany. In France the condemned were placed on a cart-wheel with their limbs stretched out along the spokes over two sturdy wooden beams. The wheel was made to slowly revolve. Through the openings between the spokes, the executioner hit the victim with an iron hammer that could easily break the victim's bones. This process was repeated several times per limb. Once his bones were broken, he was left on the wheel to die. It could take hours, even days, before shock and dehydration caused death. The punishment was abolished in Germany as late as 1827.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wheel, Breaking on the |volume=28 |page=586}}</ref>\n\n===Etymology===\nThe word 'torture' comes from the French ''torture'', originating in the [[Late Latin]] ''tortura'' and ultimately deriving the [[past participle]] of ''torquere'' meaning 'to twist'.<ref name=\"isbn0877797137 \">{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary, 10th Edition |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=Springfield, Mass |year=1999 |page= 1246|isbn=978-0-87779-713-5 }}</ref><ref name=EB1911/> The word is also used loosely to describe more ordinary discomforts that would be accurately described as tedious rather than painful; for example, \"making this spreadsheet was torture!\"\n\nAccording to Diderot's ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'', torture was also referred to as \"the question\" in seventeenth-century France. This term is derived from torture's use in criminal cases: as the accused is tortured, the torturers would typically ask questions to the accused in an effort to learn more about the crime.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.891 | title = Question or Torture | journal = Encyclopedia of Diderot & d'Alembert \u2013 Collaborative Translation Project | accessdate = 1 April 2015| date = February 2008 | last1 = d'Argis (Biography) | first1 = Antoine-Gaspard Boucher }}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Religious perspectives}}\n\n==Religious perspectives==\n\n===Roman Catholic Church===\n{{main|Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition|Medieval Inquisition}}\n{{see also|Christian views on Hell#Roman Catholicism}}\n\nThroughout the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] generally opposed the use of torture during criminal proceedings. This is evident from a letter sent by Pope [[Pope Nicholas I|Saint Nicholas]] the Great to [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Khan Boris]] of the Bulgars in AD 866, delivered in response to a series of questions from the former and concerned with the ongoing [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianisation of Bulgaria]]. ''Ad Consulta Vestra'' (as entitled in Latin) declared judicial torture to be a practice that was fundamentally contrary to [[divine law]].<ref name=\"legacy.fordham.edu\">{{cite web|title=The Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgars, 866|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/866nicholas-bulgar.asp=27}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Pontiff made it a point of incontrovertible truth that, in his own words: \"confession [to a crime] should be spontaneous, not compelled, and should not be elicited with violence but rather proferred voluntarily\". He argued for an alternative and more humane procedure, in which the accused person would be required to swear an oath of innocence upon the \"holy Gospel that he did not commit [the crime] which is laid against him and from that moment on the matter is [to be put] at an end\".<ref name=\"legacy.fordham.edu\"/> Nicholas likewise stressed in the same letter that \"those who refuse to receive the good of Christianity and sacrifice and bend their knees to idols\" were to be moved towards accepting the true faith \"by warnings, exhortations, and reason rather than by force,\" emphasising to this end that \"violence should by no means be inflicted upon them to make them believe. For everything which is not voluntary, cannot be good\".<ref name=\"legacy.fordham.edu\"/>\n\nIn the High Middle Ages, the Church became increasingly concerned with the perceived threat posed to its existence by resurgent heresy, in particular, that attributed to a purported sect known as the [[Cathars]]. Catharism had its roots in the Paulician movement in Armenia and eastern Byzantine Anatolia and the [[Bogomils]] of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Consequently, the Church began to enjoin secular rulers to extirpate heresy (lest the ruler's Catholic subjects are absolved from their allegiance), and in order to coerce heretics or witnesses \"into confessing their errors and accusing others,\" decided to sanction the use of methods of torture, already utilized by secular governments in other criminal procedures due to the [[Medieval Roman law|recovery of Roman Law]], in the medieval inquisitions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canons of the Fourth Lateran Council, 1215|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.asp|website=canon 3|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SS Innocentius IV \u2013 Bulla 'Ad_Extirpanda'|url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/01p/1252-05-15,_SS_Innocentius_IV,_Bulla_%27Ad_Extirpanda%27,_EN.pdf|website=1252|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> However, Pope Innocent IV, in the Bull [[Ad extirpanda]] (15 May 1252), stipulated that the inquisitors were to \"stop short of danger to life or limb\".<ref>''Ad extirpanda'', quoted at [http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt119.html ''The Roman Theological Forum'']</ref>\n\nThe modern Church's views regarding torture have changed drastically, largely reverting to the earlier stance. In 1953, in an address to the 6th International Congress of Penal Law, Pope Pius XII approvingly reiterated the position of Pope Nicholas the Great over a thousand years before him, when his predecessor had unilaterally opposed the use of judicial torture, stating: {{quotation|\nPreliminary juridical proceedings must exclude physical and psychological torture and the use of drugs: first of all, because they violate a natural right, even if the accused is indeed guilty, and secondly because all too often they give rise to erroneous results...About eleven hundred years ago, in 866, the great Pope Nicholas I replied in the following way to a question posed by a people which had just come into contact with Christianity:\n'If a thief or a bandit is caught, and denies what is imputed to him, you say among you that the judge should beat him on the head with blows and pierce his sides with iron spikes, until he speaks the truth. That, neither divine nor human law admits: the confession must not be forced, but spontaneous; it must not be extorted, but voluntary; lastly, if it happens that, after having inflicted these sufferings, you discover absolutely nothing concerning that with which you have charged the accused, are you not ashamed then at least, and do you not recognize how impious your judgment was? Likewise, if the accused, unable to bear such tortures, admits to crimes which he has not committed, who, I ask you, has the responsibility for such an impiety? Is it not he who forced him to such a deceitful confession? Furthermore, if some one utters with his lips what is not in his mind, it is well known that he is not confessing, he is merely speaking. Put away these things, then, and hate from the bottom of your heart what heretofore you have had the folly to practice; in truth, what fruit did you then draw from that of which you are now ashamed?'\nWho would not wish that, during the long period of time elapsed since then, justice had never laid this rule aside! The need to recall the warning given eleven hundred years ago is a sad sign of the miscarriages of juridical practice in the twentieth century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pope Pius XII: 6th International Congress of Penal Law |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gyIgwz_lDGkC&pg=PA161|website=1252|isbn=9789287145147|last1=Carpentier|first1=Jean|last2=Council For Cultural Co-Operation|first2=Council of Europe|date=2001}}</ref>}} Thus, the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (published in 1994) condemns the use of torture as a grave violation of [[human rights]]. In No. 2297-2298 it states:\n\n{{quotation|\nTorture, which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for the person and for human dignity... In times past, cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate governments to maintain law and order, often without protest from the Pastors of the Church, who themselves adopted in their own tribunals the prescriptions of Roman law concerning torture. Regrettable as these facts are, the Church always taught the duty of clemency and mercy. She forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent times it has become evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public order nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human person. On the contrary, these practices led to ones even more degrading. It is necessary to work for their abolition. We must pray for the victims and their tormentors. }}\n\n===Sharia law===\nThe prevalent view among jurists of [[sharia law]] is that torture is not permitted under any circumstances.<ref>[https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cjil/vol8/iss1/4/ Reza, Sadiq (2007) ''Torture and Islamic Law,'' Chicago Journal of International Law: Vol. 8: No. 1, Article 4.]</ref> However, it has been acknowledged that various verses of the Quran have stated how Islam permits torture if there is a necessary reason for it, such as for those who are deemed as waging war against Islam, disbelievers, adulterers and fornicators.<ref>https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/torture.aspx</ref> Violations in some stricter jurisdictions include acts of public indecency or immorality, which can result in floggings.

The conventions refer to:\n* \"wounded and sick combatants or non-combatants\"\n* \"civilian persons who take no part in hostilities, and who, while they reside in the zones, perform no work of a military character\"<ref>[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], Article 15.</ref>\n* \"Members of the [[armed forces]] of a Party to the conflict as well as members of [[militias]] or [[Military volunteer|volunteer corps]] forming part of such armed forces\"\n* \"Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized [[resistance movements]] belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this [[Military occupation|territory is occupied]]\"\n* \"Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power\"\n* \"Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of [[military aircraft]] crews, [[war correspondent]]s, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces\"\n* \"Members of crews, including masters, pilots, and apprentices, of the [[merchant marine]] and the crews of [[civil aircraft]] of the Parties to the conflict\"\n* \"Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units\".<ref>[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], Article 4</ref>\n\nThe [[first Geneva Convention|first]] (GCI), [[second Geneva Convention|second]] (GCII), [[third Geneva Convention|third]] (GCIII), and [[fourth Geneva Convention|fourth]] (GCIV) Geneva Conventions are the four most relevant for the treatment of the victims of conflicts. All treaties states in Article 3, in similar wording, that in a non-international armed conflict, \"Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms... shall in all circumstances be treated humanely.\" The treaty also states that there must not be any \"violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, [[mutilation]], cruel treatment and torture\" or \"outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment\".<ref>[[s:First Geneva Convention|First Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.</ref><ref>[[s:Second Geneva Convention|Second Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.</ref><ref>[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.</ref><ref>[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.</ref>\n\nGCI covers wounded combatants in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, members of the armed forces who are sick or wounded \"shall be respected and protected in all circumstances. They shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Party to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments\".\n\nGCII covers shipwreck survivors at sea in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, persons \"who are at sea and who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances, it being understood that the term \"shipwreck\" means shipwreck from any cause and includes forced landings at sea by or from aircraft. Such persons shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Parties to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments\".\n\nGCIII covers the treatment of [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) in an international armed conflict. In particular, Article 17 says that \"No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.\" POW status under GCIII has far fewer exemptions than \"Protected Person\" status under GCIV. Captured combatants in an international armed conflict automatically have the protection of GCIII and are POWs under GCIII unless they are determined by a competent tribunal to not be a POW (GCIII Article 5).\n\nGCIV covers most [[civilian]]s in an international armed conflict, and says they are usually \"Protected Persons\" (see exemptions section immediately after this for those who are not). Under Article 32, civilians have the right to protection from \"murder, torture, corporal punishments, mutilation, and medical or scientific experiments...but also to any other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents.\"\n\n====Geneva Convention IV exemptions====\nGCIV provides an important exemption:\n{{quotation|Where in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention [ie GCIV] as would ... be prejudicial to the security of such State ... In each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity (GCIV Article 5)}}\n\nAlso, nationals of a State not bound by the Convention are not protected by it, and nationals of a neutral State in the territory of a combatant State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, cannot claim the protection of GCIV if their home state has normal diplomatic representation in the State that holds them (Article 4), as their diplomatic representatives can take steps to protect them. The requirement to treat persons with \"humanity\" implies that it is still prohibited to torture individuals not protected by the Convention.\n\nThe [[George W. Bush administration]] afforded fewer protections, under GCIII, to detainees in the \"[[War on Terror]]\" by codifying the legal status of an \"[[unlawful combatant]]\". If there is a question of whether a person is a lawful combatant, he (or she) must be treated as a POW \"until their status has been determined by a competent tribunal\" (GCIII Article 5). If the tribunal decides that he is an unlawful combatant, he is not considered a protected person under GCIII. However, if he is a protected person under GCIV he still has some protection under GCIV and must be \"treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention\" (GCIV Article 5).<ref group=nb>\n\"Every person in enemy hands must have some status under international law: he is either a prisoner of war and, as such, covered by the Third Convention, a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention, or again, a member of the medical personnel of the armed forces who is covered by the First Convention. ''There is no'' intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law. We feel that this is a satisfactory solution \u2013 not only satisfying to the mind but also, and above all, satisfactory from the humanitarian point of view.\", because in the opinion of the ICRC \"If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered 'unlawful' or 'unprivileged' combatants or belligerents (the treaties of humanitarian law do not expressly contain these terms). They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action\" ([[Jean Pictet]] (ed.) \u2013 [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600007?OpenDocument Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1958)] \u2013 1994 reprint edition).

These clarify and extend the definitions in some areas, but to date, many countries, including the United States, have either not signed them or have not ratified them.\n\n[[Protocol I]] does not mention torture but it does affect the treatment of POWs and Protected Persons. In Article 5, the protocol explicitly involves \"the appointment of Protecting Powers and of their substitute\" to monitor that the Parties to the conflict are enforcing the Conventions.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080410223403/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol1.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol 1)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.</ref> The protocol also broadens the definition of a lawful combatant in wars against \"alien occupation, colonial domination, and racist regimes\" to include those who carry arms openly but are not wearing uniforms, so that they are now [[lawful combatant]]s and protected by the Geneva Conventions\u2014although only if the Occupying Power has ratified Protocol I. Under the original conventions, combatants without a recognizable insignia could be treated as war criminals, and potentially be executed. It also mentions spies and defines who is a mercenary. Mercenaries and spies are considered an unlawful combatant, and not protected by the same conventions.\n\n[[Protocol II]] \"develops and supplements Article 3 [relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts] common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 without modifying its existing conditions of application\" (Article 1). Any person who does not take part in or ceased to take part in hostilities is entitled to humane treatment. Among the acts prohibited against these persons are, \"Violence to the life, health and physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular, murder as well as cruel treatment such as torture, mutilation or any form of corporal punishment\" (Article 4.a), \"Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault\" (Article 4.e), and \"Threats to commit any of the foregoing acts\" (Article 4.h).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080612085204/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol2.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.</ref> Clauses in other articles implore humane treatment of enemy personnel in an internal conflict. These have a bearing on torture, but no other clauses explicitly mention torture.\n\n===Other conventions===\nIn accordance with the optional [[UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]] (1955), ''\"[[corporal punishment]], punishment by placing in a dark cell, and all cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments shall be completely prohibited as punishments for disciplinary offences.\"''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080718003225/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_comp34.htm Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners], United Nations, Geneva, 1955.</ref> The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], (16 December 1966), explicitly prohibits torture and ''\"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\"'' by signatories.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] United Nations, 16 December 1966.</ref>\n\n;European agreements\n[[File:10CFREU-Article4.jpg|right|thumb|Article 4 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] prohibits torture.]]\n\nIn 1950 during the [[Cold War]], the participating member states of the [[Council of Europe]] signed the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The treaty was based on the [[UDHR]]. It included the provision for a court to interpret the treaty, and Article 3 '''\"Prohibition of torture\"''' stated; ''\"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\"''<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm European Convention on Human Rights], 4 November 1950(with later protocols).</ref>\n\nIn 1978, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the [[five techniques]] of \"[[sensory deprivation]]\" were not torture as laid out in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, but were \"''inhuman or degrading treatment''\"<ref>[http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/1.html Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1977]. (Case No. 5310/71)</ref> (see [[Uses of torture in recent times#United Kingdom|Accusations of use of torture by United Kingdom]] for details). This case occurred nine years before the United Nations Convention Against Torture came into force and had an influence on thinking about what constitutes torture ever since.<ref>Michael John Garcia (Legislative Attorney American Law Division) [http://www.ilw.com/immigdaily/news/2005,1223-crs.pdf U.N. Convention Against Torture (CAT):Overview and Application to Interrogation Techniques] [http://www.ilw.com/ CRS Report for Congress] 7 November 2005. pp. 13\u201315</ref>\n\nOn 26 November 1987, the member states of the [[Council of Europe]], meeting at [[Strasbourg]], adopted the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] (ECPT). Two additional Protocols amended the Convention, which entered into force on 1 March 2002. The Convention set up the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] to oversee compliance with its provisions.\n\n;Inter-American Convention\nThe [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]], currently ratified by 18 nations of the [[Americas]] and in force since 28 February 1987, defines torture more expansively than the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\n{{quotation|For the purposes of this Convention, torture shall be understood to be any act intentionally performed whereby physical or mental pain or suffering is inflicted on a person for purposes of a criminal investigation, as a means of intimidation, as personal punishment, as a preventive measure, as a penalty, or for any other purpose. Torture shall also be understood to be the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish.\n\nThe concept of torture shall not include physical or mental pain or suffering that is inherent in or solely the consequence of lawful measures, provided that they do not include the performance of the acts or use of the methods referred to in this article.<ref name=\"autogenerated1985\"/>}}\n\n===Supervision of anti-torture treaties===\nThe [[Istanbul Protocol]], an official UN document, is the first set of international guidelines for documentation of torture and its consequences. It became a United Nations official document in 1999.\n\nUnder the provisions of [[OPCAT]] that entered into force on 22 June 2006 independent international and national bodies regularly visit places where people are deprived of their liberty, to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Each state that ratified the OPCAT, according to Article 17, is responsible for creating or maintaining at least one independent national preventive mechanism for torture prevention at the domestic level.\n\nThe European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, citing Article 1 of the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture]], states that it will, \"by means of visits, examine the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty with a view to strengthening, if necessary, the protection of such persons from torture and from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/about.htm|title=About the CPT|website=coe.int}}</ref>\n\nIn times of armed conflict between a signatory of the Geneva Conventions and another party, delegates of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) monitor the compliance of signatories to the Geneva Conventions, which includes monitoring the use of torture. Human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], the [[World Organization Against Torture]], and [[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] work actively to stop the use of torture throughout the world and publish reports on any activities they consider to be torture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apt.ch/|title=Association for the Prevention of Torture|website=apt.ch}}</ref>\n\n===Municipal law===\n[[Sovereign state|States]] that ratified the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] have a treaty obligation to include the provisions into [[municipal law]]. The laws of many states therefore formally prohibit torture. However, such ''[[de jure]]'' legal provisions are by no means a proof that, ''[[de facto]]'', the signatory country does not use torture. To prevent torture, many legal systems have a [[right against self-incrimination]] or explicitly prohibit undue force when dealing with suspects.\n\nThe French 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], of constitutional value, prohibits submitting suspects to any hardship not necessary to secure his or her person.\n\nThe [[U.S. Constitution]] and [[U.S. law]] prohibits the use of unwarranted force or coercion against any person who is subject to interrogation, detention, or arrest. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] includes protection against [[self-incrimination]], which states that \"[n]o person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\". This serves as the basis of the [[Miranda warning]], which [[Law enforcement in the United States|U.S. law enforcement personnel]] issue to individuals upon their arrest. Additionally, the U.S. Constitution's [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] forbids the use of \"[[cruel and unusual punishments]],\" which is widely interpreted as prohibiting torture. Finally, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2340<ref>{{USC|18|2340}} ''et seq''..</ref> ''et seq.'' define and forbid torture committed by U.S. nationals outside the United States or non-U.S. nationals who are present in the United States. As the United States recognizes [[customary international law]], or the [[law of nations]], the U.S. [[Alien Tort Claims Act]] and the [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] also provides legal remedies for victims of torture outside of the United States. Specifically, the status of torturers under the law of the United States, as determined by a famous legal decision in 1980, ''[[Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala]]'', 630 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 876 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2d Cir.]] 1980), is that, \"the torturer has become, like the [[maritime piracy|pirate]] and the [[slave trade]]r before him, [[hostis humani generis]], an enemy of all mankind.\"<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Fil\u00e1rtiga v.

As a result, there is no way to know whether or not the resulting statement is actually correct. If any court relies on any evidence obtained from torture regardless of validity, it provides an incentive for state officials to force a confession, creating a marketplace for torture, both domestically and overseas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apt.ch/en/evidence-obtained-through-torture/ |title=Exclusion of evidence obtained through torture |publisher=[[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] |accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Within national borders====\n[[File:ExtRenditionMap.gif|thumb|280px|right|\n{{legend|#000000|The U.S. and suspected [[CIA]] \"[[black site]]s\"}}\n{{legend|#3333FF|[[Extraordinary rendition]]s allegedly have been carried out from these countries}}\n{{legend|#9999FF|Detainees have allegedly been transported through these countries}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|Detainees have allegedly arrived in these countries}}\n''Sources:'' Amnesty International<ref name=AmnestyInternational060101>[https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/POL30/003/2006/en {{\"'}}Rendition' and secret detention: A global system of human rights violations\"], [[Amnesty International]], 1 January 2006</ref> [[Human Rights Watch]]]]\nMost states have prohibited their legal systems from accepting evidence that is extracted by torture.

However, there was a clear divide between those countries with strong rejection of torture (such as Italy, where only 14% supported torture) and nations where rejection was less strong. Often this lessened rejection is found in countries severely and frequently threatened by terrorist attacks.

In practice, the distinctions between physical and psychological torture are often blurred. <ref>https://cislacnigeria.net/understanding-nigerian-torture-prohibition-bill</ref> Physical torture is the inflicting of severe pain or suffering on a person. In contrast, psychological torture is directed at the psyche with calculated violations of psychological needs, along with deep damage to psychological structures and the breakage of beliefs underpinning normal [[sanity]]. Torturers often inflict both types of torture in combination to compound the associated effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nPsychological torture also includes deliberate use of extreme [[psychological stress|stressors]] and situations such as [[mock execution]], [[shunning]], violation of deep-seated social or [[sexual norm]]s and [[taboo]]s, or extended [[solitary confinement]].

Many victims suffer from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), which includes symptoms such as flashbacks (or intrusive thoughts), severe anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, depression and memory lapses. Torture victims often feel guilt and shame, triggered by the humiliation they have endured. Many feel that they have betrayed themselves or their friends and family. All such symptoms are normal human responses to abnormal and inhuman treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/defining-torture.aspx |title= What is torture? |publisher=IRCT |accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrganizations like [[Freedom from Torture]] and the [[Center for Victims of Torture]] try to help survivors of torture obtain medical treatment and to gain [[forensic]] medical [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to obtain [[refugee|political asylum]] in a safe country or to prosecute the perpetrators.\n\nTorture is often difficult to prove, particularly when some time has passed between the event and a medical examination, or when the torturers are immune from prosecution. Many torturers around the world use methods designed to have a maximum psychological impact while leaving only minimal physical traces. Medical and Human Rights Organizations worldwide have collaborated to produce the [[Istanbul Protocol]], a document designed to outline common torture methods, consequences of torture, and medico-legal examination techniques. Typically deaths due to torture are shown in an autopsy as being due to \"natural causes\" like heart attack, inflammation, or [[embolism]] due to extreme [[stress (medicine)|stress]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://action.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/102405/\n |title       = Autopsy reports reveal homicides of detainees in U.S. custody\n |publisher   = ACLU\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060214132621/http://action.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/102405/\n |archivedate = 14 February 2006\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nFor survivors, torture often leads to lasting [[mental health|mental]] and physical health problems.\n\nPhysical problems can be wide-ranging, e.g. [[sexually transmitted diseases]], musculo-skeletal problems, [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]], post-traumatic [[epilepsy]] and [[dementia]] or chronic pain syndromes.\n\nOn 19 August 2007, the [[American Psychology Association]] (APA) voted to bar participation, to intervene to stop, and to report involvement in a wide variety of interrogation techniques as torture, including \"using [[mock execution]]s, simulated drowning, sexual and religious humiliation, stress positions or sleep deprivation\", as well as \"the exploitation of prisoners' phobias, the use of mind-altering drugs, [[hooding]], forced nakedness, the use of dogs to frighten detainees, exposing prisoners to extreme heat and cold, physical assault and threatening the use of such techniques against a prisoner or a prisoner's family.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/19/AR2007081901513.html|title=APA Rules on Interrogation Abuse|website=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the APA rejected a stronger resolution that sought to prohibit \"all psychologist involvement, either direct or indirect, in any interrogations at U.S. detention centers for foreign detainees or citizens detained outside normal legal channels.\" That resolution would have placed the APA alongside the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association in limiting professional involvement in such settings to direct patient care. The APA echoed the Bush administration by condemning isolation, sleep deprivation, and sensory deprivation or over-stimulation only when they are likely to cause lasting harm.\n\nPsychiatric treatment of torture-related medical problems might require a wide range of expertise and often specialized experience. Common treatments are [[psychotropic]] [[medication]], e.g. [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] [[antidepressants]], [[counseling]], [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]], [[family systems therapy]] and [[physiotherapy]].\n\n==Rehabilitation==\n\nThe aim of rehabilitation is to empower the torture victim to resume as full a life as possible. Rebuilding the life of someone whose dignity has been destroyed takes time and as a result, long-term material, medical, psychological and social support is needed.<ref name=\"Rehabilitation\">{{cite web|title=Rehabilitation|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/rehabilitation.aspx|website=What is torture?|publisher=International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT)|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nTreatment must be a coordinated effort that covers both physical and psychological aspects. It is important to take into consideration the patients' needs, problems, expectations, views, and cultural references.<ref name=\"Rehabilitation\"/>\n\nThe consequences of torture are likely to be influenced by many internal and external factors. Therefore, rehabilitation needs to employ different treatment approaches, taking into account the victims' individual needs, as well as the cultural, social and political environment.<ref name=\"Rehabilitation\"/>\n\nRehabilitation centres around the world, notably the members of the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]], commonly offer multi-disciplinary support and counselling, including:\n*medical attention / psychotherapeutic treatment\n*psychosocial support/trauma treatment\n*legal services and redress\n*social reintegration.\nIn the case of asylum seekers and refugees, the services may also include assisting in the documentation of torture for the asylum decision, language classes and help in finding somewhere to live and work.<ref name=\"Rehabilitation\"/>\n\n===Rehabilitation of secondary survivors===\nIn the worst case, torture can affect several generations. The physical and mental after-effects of torture often place great strain on the entire family and society. Children are particularly vulnerable.

Torture, by definition, is a [[mens rea|knowing and intentional act]]; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict suffering or pain, without a specific intent to do so, are not typically considered torture.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/23038/9-insane-torture-techniques |title = 9 Insane Torture Techniques|date = 19 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nTorture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals, groups, and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day, and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or longer. Reasons for torture can include [[punishment]], [[revenge]], [[extortion]], [[persuasion]], political [[Brainwashing|re-education]], [[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[coercion]] of the victim or a third party, [[interrogation]] to extract information or a [[confession]] irrespective of whether it is [[false confession|false]], or simply the [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] gratification of those carrying out or observing the torture.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.losangelescriminallawyer.pro/california-penal-code-section-206-pc-torture.html | title=California Penal Code Section 206 PC: Torture}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.shouselaw.com/torture.html |title = Penal Code 206 \u2013 the crime of \"Torture\" in California law}}</ref> Alternatively, some forms of torture are designed to inflict [[Psychological torture|psychological pain]] or leave as little physical injury or evidence as possible while achieving the same psychological devastation. The torturer may or may not kill or injure the victim, but torture may result in a [[murder|deliberate death]] and serves as a form of [[capital punishment]]. Depending on the aim, even a form of torture that is intentionally fatal may be prolonged to allow the victim to suffer as long as possible (such as [[half-hanging]]). In other cases, the torturer may be indifferent to the condition of the victim.\n\nAlthough torture is sanctioned by some states, it is prohibited under [[international law]] and the [[domestic laws]] of most countries. Although widely illegal and reviled, there is an ongoing debate as to what exactly is and is not legally defined as torture. It is a serious violation of [[human rights]], and is declared to be unacceptable (but not illegal) by Article 5 of the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and the [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 8 June 1977 officially agree not to torture captured persons in [[armed conflicts]], whether international or internal.

Torture grew into an ornate discipline, where calibrated violence served two functions: to investigate and produce confessions and to attack the body as a form of punishment. Entire populaces of towns would show up to witness an execution by torture in the public square. Those who had been \"spared\" torture were commonly locked barefooted into the stocks, where children took delight in rubbing feces into their hair and mouths.<ref>G. R. Scott, ''A History of Torture'' (London: Merchant, 1995).</ref>\n\nDeliberately painful methods of torture and execution for severe crimes were taken for granted as part of justice until the development of [[Humanism]] in [[17th-century philosophy]], and \"[[cruel and unusual punishment]]\" came to be denounced in the [[English Bill of Rights]] of 1689. The [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the [[Western world]] further developed the idea of universal [[human rights]]. The adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 marks the recognition at least nominally of a general ban of torture by all UN member states.\n\nIts effect in practice is limited, however, as the Declaration is not ratified officially and does not have a legally binding character in international law, but is rather considered part of [[customary international law]]. Several countries still practice torture today. Some countries have legally codified it, and others have claimed that it is not practiced while maintaining the use of torture in secret.<ref>\"Nigeria's Torture Chambers Exposed in New Report.\" ''Amnesty''.

Hirsch, ''ed''., ''The Book of Torture and Executions'' (Toronto: Golden Books, 1944).</ref> ''First-degree'' torture typically took the forms of whipping and beating but did not mutilate the body. The most prevalent modern example is [[bastinado]], a technique of beating or whipping the soles of the bare feet. ''Second-degree'' torture consisted almost entirely of crushing devices and procedures, including screw presses or \"bone vises\" that crushed thumbs, toes, knees, feet, even teeth and skulls in a wide variety of ways. A wide array of [[Boot (torture)|\"boots\"]]\u2014-machines designed to slowly crush feet\u2014-are representative. Finally, ''third-degree'' tortures savagely mutilated the body in numerous dreadful ways, incorporating spikes, blades, boiling oil, and controlled fire. The serrated iron tongue shredder; the red-hot copper basin for destroying eyesight ([[abacination]], ''q.v.''); and the stocks that forcibly held the prisoner's naked feet, glistening with lard, directly over red-hot coals ([[foot roasting]], ''q.v.'') until the skin and foot muscles were burnt black and the bones fell to ashes are examples of torture in the third degree.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:Flaying of rebels.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Assyria]]ns skinning or flaying their prisoners alive]]\nJudicial torture was probably first applied in Persia, either by [[Medes]] or [[Achaemenid Empire]].

Torture was deemed a legitimate means to extract confessions or to obtain the names of accomplices or other information about a crime, although many confessions were greatly invalid due to the victim being forced to confess under great agony and pressure. It was permitted by law only if there was already [[half-proof]] against the accused.<ref>J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal''.

By contrast, torturous executions were typically public, and woodcuts of English prisoners being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] show large crowds of spectators, as do paintings of Spanish [[auto-da-f\u00e9]] executions, in which heretics were burned at the stake. Torture was also used during this time period as a means of reform, spectacle, to induce fear into the public, and most popularly as a punishment for treason.\n\nMedieval torture devices were varied. One old English chronicle from the Early Medieval period reads, \"They hanged them by the thumbs, or by the head, and hung fires on their feet; they put knotted strings about their heads and writhed them so that it went to the brain ... Some they put in a chest that was short, and narrow, and shallow, and put sharp stones therein, and pressed the man therein so that they broke all his limbs ...

Specific devices were also created and used during this time, including the rack, the Pear (also mentioned in Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811) as \"Choak [''sic.''] Pears,\" and described as being \"formerly used in Holland.\"), [[thumbscrew (torture)|thumbscrew]]s, animals like rats, the [[iron chair]], and the [[cat o nine tails]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5402/5402.txt | title=1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue}}</ref>\n\n===Early modern period===\n[[File:Lingchi (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Lingchi]] \u2013 execution by [[slow slicing]] \u2013 in Beijing around 1904.]]\n\nDuring the early modern period, the [[torture of witches]] took place.

He was one of the first to protest against all means of torture.\n\nWhile secular courts often treated suspects ferociously, [[Will Durant|Will]] and Ariel Durant argued in ''The Age of Faith'' that many of the most vicious procedures were inflicted upon pious [[heresy|heretics]] by even more pious friars.

For this reason, in England, a regularized system of judicial torture never existed and its use was limited to political cases. Torture was in theory not permitted under English law, but in [[Tudors|Tudor]] and early [[Stuarts|Stuart]] times, under certain conditions, torture was used in England. For example, the confession of [[Marc Smeaton]] at the trial of [[Anne Boleyn]] was presented in written form only, either to hide from the court that Smeaton had been tortured on [[Rack (torture)|the rack]] for four hours, or because [[Thomas Cromwell]] was worried that he would recant his confession if cross-examined. When [[Guy Fawkes]] was arrested for his role in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605 he was tortured until he revealed all he knew about the plot. This was not so much to extract a confession, which was not needed to prove his guilt, but to extract from him the names of his fellow conspirators. By this time torture was not routine in England and a special warrant from King [[James I of England|James I]] was needed before he could be tortured. The wording of the warrant shows some concerns for humanitarian considerations, specifying that the severity of the methods of interrogation were to be increased only gradually until the interrogators were sure that Fawkes had told all he knew.\n[[File:Nabijanje na kolac igumana Pajsija.JPG|thumb|[[Impalement]] of Serbian [[Had\u017ei-Prodan's rebellion|rebel leaders]] in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman-ruled Serbia]] in 1814]]\n\nThe [[privy council]] attempted to have [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]] who stabbed [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] to death in 1628 questioned under torture on the rack, but the judges resisted, unanimously declaring its use to be contrary to the [[English law|laws of England]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Jardine|first=David|authorlink=David Jardine (barrister)|title=A Reading on the Use of Torture in the Criminal Law of England|url=https://archive.org/details/areadingonuseto01jardgoog|publisher=Baldwin and Cradock|location=London|year=1837|pages=[https://archive.org/details/areadingonuseto01jardgoog/page/n28 10]\u201312}}</ref> Torture was abolished in England around 1640 (except ''[[peine forte et dure]]'', which was abolished in 1772).\n\nIn [[Colonial America]], women were sentenced to the [[stocks]] with wooden clips on their tongues or subjected to the \"[[dunking stool]]\" for the gender-specific crime of talking too much.<ref>Brizendine, Louann ''The Female Brain'' Broadway Books.

[[Johann Graefe]] in 1624 published ''Tribunal Reformation'', a case against torture. [[Cesare Beccaria]], an Italian lawyer, published in 1764 \"An Essay on Crimes and Punishments\", in which he argued that torture unjustly punished the innocent and should be unnecessary in proving guilt. [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778) also fiercely condemned torture in some of his essays.\n\nWhile in Egypt in 1798, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] wrote to Major-General Berthier regarding the validity of torture as an interrogation tool:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe barbarous custom of whipping men suspected of having important secrets to reveal must be abolished. It has always been recognized that this method of interrogation, by putting men to the torture, is useless.

The echelle more commonly known as the \"ladder\" or \"rack\" was a long table that the accused would lie upon and be stretched violently. The torture was used so intensely that on many occasions the victim's limbs would be pulled out of the socket and, at times, the limbs would even be torn from the body entirely. On some special occasions a tortillon was used in conjunction with the ladder which would severely squeeze and mutilate the genitals at the same time as the stretching was occurring.<ref name=\"HRTR p120\"/> Similar to the ladder was the \"lift\". It too stretched the limbs of the accused; in this instance however the victim's feet were strapped to the ground and their arms were tied behind their back before a rope was tied to their hands and lifted upwards. This caused the arms to break before the portion of the stretching began.<ref name=\"HRTR p121\"/> Finally, the judicial system of King James favored the use of the turkas, an ingenious and savage iron instrument for destroying the nails of the fingers and toes. The sharp point of the instrument was first pushed under the nail to the root, splitting the nail down the centerline. Pincers then grabbed either edge of the destroyed nail and slowly tore it away from the nail bed.  Other common tortures included the strappado, a system of weights and pulleys with which the prisoner was trussed up and jerked in order to dislocate his limbs; the water torture, by which he was maintained at the very edge of drowning; and the so-called torture by fire, in which the bare feet, immobilized in iron stocks and smeared with lard, were slowly barbecued over red-hot coals.\n\n===Since 1948===\n[[File:Buchenwald Eisenhower torture demonstration 63511.jpg|thumb|Survivors of the [[Ohrdruf concentration camp]] demonstrate torture methods used in the camp]]\n{{Main|Use of torture since 1948}}\n\nModern sensibilities have been shaped by a profound reaction to the [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] committed by the [[Axis Powers]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] in the [[Second World War]], which have led to a sweeping international rejection of most if not all aspects of the practice.<ref>Elihu Lauterpacht, C.

According to apocryphal lore, ''l\u00edng che'' began when the torturer, wielding an extremely sharp knife, began by putting out the eyes, rendering the condemned incapable of seeing the remainder of the torture and, presumably, adding considerably to the psychological terror of the procedure. Successive rather minor cuts chopped off ears, nose, tongue, fingers, toes, and such before proceeding to grosser cuts that removed large collops of flesh from more sizable parts, e.g., thighs and shoulders. The entire process was said to last three days, and to total 3,600 cuts. The heavily carved bodies of the deceased were then put on a parade for a show in the public. More typical was to bribe the executioner to administer hasty death to the victim after a small number of dramatic slices inflicted for showmanship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|title=Death by a Thousand Cuts at Chinese Arts Centre until 23rd March|website=manchestereventsguide.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418031632/http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|archivedate=18 April 2009}}</ref><ref>Lamb, H.

The penetration can be through the sides, from the [[rectum]], or through the [[Human mouth|mouth]] or [[vagina]]. This method would lead to slow, painful, death. Often, the victim was hoisted into the air after partial impalement. Gravity and the victim's own struggles would cause him to slide down the pole. Death could take many days. Impalement was frequently practiced in Asia and Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Vlad III Dracula]] and [[Ivan the Terrible]] have passed into legend as major users of the method.<ref>[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9382120/Dracula Dracula \u2013 Britannica Concise] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThe ''breaking wheel'' was a torturous [[capital punishment]] device used in the [[Middle Ages]] and early modern times for public execution by [[Club (weapon)|cudgeling]] to death, especially in France and Germany. In France the condemned were placed on a cart-wheel with their limbs stretched out along the spokes over two sturdy wooden beams. The wheel was made to slowly revolve. Through the openings between the spokes, the executioner hit the victim with an iron hammer that could easily break the victim's bones. This process was repeated several times per limb. Once his bones were broken, he was left on the wheel to die. It could take hours, even days, before shock and dehydration caused death. The punishment was abolished in Germany as late as 1827.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wheel, Breaking on the |volume=28 |page=586}}</ref>\n\n===Etymology===\nThe word 'torture' comes from the French ''torture'', originating in the [[Late Latin]] ''tortura'' and ultimately deriving the [[past participle]] of ''torquere'' meaning 'to twist'.<ref name=\"isbn0877797137 \">{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary, 10th Edition |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=Springfield, Mass |year=1999 |page= 1246|isbn=978-0-87779-713-5 }}</ref><ref name=EB1911/> The word is also used loosely to describe more ordinary discomforts that would be accurately described as tedious rather than painful; for example, \"making this spreadsheet was torture!\"\n\nAccording to Diderot's ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'', torture was also referred to as \"the question\" in seventeenth-century France. This term is derived from torture's use in criminal cases: as the accused is tortured, the torturers would typically ask questions to the accused in an effort to learn more about the crime.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.891 | title = Question or Torture | journal = Encyclopedia of Diderot & d'Alembert \u2013 Collaborative Translation Project | accessdate = 1 April 2015| date = February 2008 | last1 = d'Argis (Biography) | first1 = Antoine-Gaspard Boucher }}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Religious perspectives}}\n\n==Religious perspectives==\n\n===Roman Catholic Church===\n{{main|Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition|Medieval Inquisition}}\n{{see also|Christian views on Hell#Roman Catholicism}}\n\nThroughout the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] generally opposed the use of torture during criminal proceedings. This is evident from a letter sent by Pope [[Pope Nicholas I|Saint Nicholas]] the Great to [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Khan Boris]] of the Bulgars in AD 866, delivered in response to a series of questions from the former and concerned with the ongoing [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianisation of Bulgaria]]. ''Ad Consulta Vestra'' (as entitled in Latin) declared judicial torture to be a practice that was fundamentally contrary to [[divine law]].<ref name=\"legacy.fordham.edu\">{{cite web|title=The Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgars, 866|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/866nicholas-bulgar.asp=27}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Pontiff made it a point of incontrovertible truth that, in his own words: \"confession [to a crime] should be spontaneous, not compelled, and should not be elicited with violence but rather proferred voluntarily\". He argued for an alternative and more humane procedure, in which the accused person would be required to swear an oath of innocence upon the \"holy Gospel that he did not commit [the crime] which is laid against him and from that moment on the matter is [to be put] at an end\".<ref name=\"legacy.fordham.edu\"/> Nicholas likewise stressed in the same letter that \"those who refuse to receive the good of Christianity and sacrifice and bend their knees to idols\" were to be moved towards accepting the true faith \"by warnings, exhortations, and reason rather than by force,\" emphasising to this end that \"violence should by no means be inflicted upon them to make them believe. For everything which is not voluntary, cannot be good\".<ref name=\"legacy.fordham.edu\"/>\n\nIn the High Middle Ages, the Church became increasingly concerned with the perceived threat posed to its existence by resurgent heresy, in particular, that attributed to a purported sect known as the [[Cathars]]. Catharism had its roots in the Paulician movement in Armenia and eastern Byzantine Anatolia and the [[Bogomils]] of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Consequently, the Church began to enjoin secular rulers to extirpate heresy (lest the ruler's Catholic subjects are absolved from their allegiance), and in order to coerce heretics or witnesses \"into confessing their errors and accusing others,\" decided to sanction the use of methods of torture, already utilized by secular governments in other criminal procedures due to the [[Medieval Roman law|recovery of Roman Law]], in the medieval inquisitions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canons of the Fourth Lateran Council, 1215|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.asp|website=canon 3|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SS Innocentius IV \u2013 Bulla 'Ad_Extirpanda'|url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/01p/1252-05-15,_SS_Innocentius_IV,_Bulla_%27Ad_Extirpanda%27,_EN.pdf|website=1252|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> However, Pope Innocent IV, in the Bull [[Ad extirpanda]] (15 May 1252), stipulated that the inquisitors were to \"stop short of danger to life or limb\".<ref>''Ad extirpanda'', quoted at [http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt119.html ''The Roman Theological Forum'']</ref>\n\nThe modern Church's views regarding torture have changed drastically, largely reverting to the earlier stance. In 1953, in an address to the 6th International Congress of Penal Law, Pope Pius XII approvingly reiterated the position of Pope Nicholas the Great over a thousand years before him, when his predecessor had unilaterally opposed the use of judicial torture, stating: {{quotation|\nPreliminary juridical proceedings must exclude physical and psychological torture and the use of drugs: first of all, because they violate a natural right, even if the accused is indeed guilty, and secondly because all too often they give rise to erroneous results...About eleven hundred years ago, in 866, the great Pope Nicholas I replied in the following way to a question posed by a people which had just come into contact with Christianity:\n'If a thief or a bandit is caught, and denies what is imputed to him, you say among you that the judge should beat him on the head with blows and pierce his sides with iron spikes, until he speaks the truth. That, neither divine nor human law admits: the confession must not be forced, but spontaneous; it must not be extorted, but voluntary; lastly, if it happens that, after having inflicted these sufferings, you discover absolutely nothing concerning that with which you have charged the accused, are you not ashamed then at least, and do you not recognize how impious your judgment was? Likewise, if the accused, unable to bear such tortures, admits to crimes which he has not committed, who, I ask you, has the responsibility for such an impiety? Is it not he who forced him to such a deceitful confession? Furthermore, if some one utters with his lips what is not in his mind, it is well known that he is not confessing, he is merely speaking. Put away these things, then, and hate from the bottom of your heart what heretofore you have had the folly to practice; in truth, what fruit did you then draw from that of which you are now ashamed?'\nWho would not wish that, during the long period of time elapsed since then, justice had never laid this rule aside! The need to recall the warning given eleven hundred years ago is a sad sign of the miscarriages of juridical practice in the twentieth century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pope Pius XII: 6th International Congress of Penal Law |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gyIgwz_lDGkC&pg=PA161|website=1252|isbn=9789287145147|last1=Carpentier|first1=Jean|last2=Council For Cultural Co-Operation|first2=Council of Europe|date=2001}}</ref>}} Thus, the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (published in 1994) condemns the use of torture as a grave violation of [[human rights]]. In No. 2297-2298 it states:\n\n{{quotation|\nTorture, which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for the person and for human dignity... In times past, cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate governments to maintain law and order, often without protest from the Pastors of the Church, who themselves adopted in their own tribunals the prescriptions of Roman law concerning torture. Regrettable as these facts are, the Church always taught the duty of clemency and mercy. She forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent times it has become evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public order nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human person. On the contrary, these practices led to ones even more degrading. It is necessary to work for their abolition. We must pray for the victims and their tormentors. }}\n\n===Sharia law===\nThe prevalent view among jurists of [[sharia law]] is that torture is not permitted under any circumstances.<ref>[https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cjil/vol8/iss1/4/ Reza, Sadiq (2007) ''Torture and Islamic Law,'' Chicago Journal of International Law: Vol. 8: No. 1, Article 4.]</ref> However, it has been acknowledged that various verses of the Quran have stated how Islam permits torture if there is a necessary reason for it, such as for those who are deemed as waging war against Islam, disbelievers, adulterers and fornicators.<ref>https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/torture.aspx</ref> Violations in some stricter jurisdictions include acts of public indecency or immorality, which can result in floggings.

The conventions refer to:\n* \"wounded and sick combatants or non-combatants\"\n* \"civilian persons who take no part in hostilities, and who, while they reside in the zones, perform no work of a military character\"<ref>[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], Article 15.</ref>\n* \"Members of the [[armed forces]] of a Party to the conflict as well as members of [[militias]] or [[Military volunteer|volunteer corps]] forming part of such armed forces\"\n* \"Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized [[resistance movements]] belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this [[Military occupation|territory is occupied]]\"\n* \"Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power\"\n* \"Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of [[military aircraft]] crews, [[war correspondent]]s, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces\"\n* \"Members of crews, including masters, pilots, and apprentices, of the [[merchant marine]] and the crews of [[civil aircraft]] of the Parties to the conflict\"\n* \"Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units\".<ref>[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], Article 4</ref>\n\nThe [[first Geneva Convention|first]] (GCI), [[second Geneva Convention|second]] (GCII), [[third Geneva Convention|third]] (GCIII), and [[fourth Geneva Convention|fourth]] (GCIV) Geneva Conventions are the four most relevant for the treatment of the victims of conflicts. All treaties states in Article 3, in similar wording, that in a non-international armed conflict, \"Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms... shall in all circumstances be treated humanely.\" The treaty also states that there must not be any \"violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, [[mutilation]], cruel treatment and torture\" or \"outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment\".<ref>[[s:First Geneva Convention|First Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.</ref><ref>[[s:Second Geneva Convention|Second Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.</ref><ref>[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.</ref><ref>[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.</ref>\n\nGCI covers wounded combatants in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, members of the armed forces who are sick or wounded \"shall be respected and protected in all circumstances. They shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Party to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments\".\n\nGCII covers shipwreck survivors at sea in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, persons \"who are at sea and who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances, it being understood that the term \"shipwreck\" means shipwreck from any cause and includes forced landings at sea by or from aircraft. Such persons shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Parties to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments\".\n\nGCIII covers the treatment of [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) in an international armed conflict. In particular, Article 17 says that \"No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.\" POW status under GCIII has far fewer exemptions than \"Protected Person\" status under GCIV. Captured combatants in an international armed conflict automatically have the protection of GCIII and are POWs under GCIII unless they are determined by a competent tribunal to not be a POW (GCIII Article 5).\n\nGCIV covers most [[civilian]]s in an international armed conflict, and says they are usually \"Protected Persons\" (see exemptions section immediately after this for those who are not). Under Article 32, civilians have the right to protection from \"murder, torture, corporal punishments, mutilation, and medical or scientific experiments...but also to any other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents.\"\n\n====Geneva Convention IV exemptions====\nGCIV provides an important exemption:\n{{quotation|Where in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention [ie GCIV] as would ... be prejudicial to the security of such State ... In each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity (GCIV Article 5)}}\n\nAlso, nationals of a State not bound by the Convention are not protected by it, and nationals of a neutral State in the territory of a combatant State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, cannot claim the protection of GCIV if their home state has normal diplomatic representation in the State that holds them (Article 4), as their diplomatic representatives can take steps to protect them. The requirement to treat persons with \"humanity\" implies that it is still prohibited to torture individuals not protected by the Convention.\n\nThe [[George W. Bush administration]] afforded fewer protections, under GCIII, to detainees in the \"[[War on Terror]]\" by codifying the legal status of an \"[[unlawful combatant]]\". If there is a question of whether a person is a lawful combatant, he (or she) must be treated as a POW \"until their status has been determined by a competent tribunal\" (GCIII Article 5). If the tribunal decides that he is an unlawful combatant, he is not considered a protected person under GCIII. However, if he is a protected person under GCIV he still has some protection under GCIV and must be \"treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention\" (GCIV Article 5).<ref group=nb>\n\"Every person in enemy hands must have some status under international law: he is either a prisoner of war and, as such, covered by the Third Convention, a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention, or again, a member of the medical personnel of the armed forces who is covered by the First Convention. ''There is no'' intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law. We feel that this is a satisfactory solution \u2013 not only satisfying to the mind but also, and above all, satisfactory from the humanitarian point of view.\", because in the opinion of the ICRC \"If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered 'unlawful' or 'unprivileged' combatants or belligerents (the treaties of humanitarian law do not expressly contain these terms). They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action\" ([[Jean Pictet]] (ed.) \u2013 [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600007?OpenDocument Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1958)] \u2013 1994 reprint edition).

These clarify and extend the definitions in some areas, but to date, many countries, including the United States, have either not signed them or have not ratified them.\n\n[[Protocol I]] does not mention torture but it does affect the treatment of POWs and Protected Persons. In Article 5, the protocol explicitly involves \"the appointment of Protecting Powers and of their substitute\" to monitor that the Parties to the conflict are enforcing the Conventions.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080410223403/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol1.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol 1)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.</ref> The protocol also broadens the definition of a lawful combatant in wars against \"alien occupation, colonial domination, and racist regimes\" to include those who carry arms openly but are not wearing uniforms, so that they are now [[lawful combatant]]s and protected by the Geneva Conventions\u2014although only if the Occupying Power has ratified Protocol I. Under the original conventions, combatants without a recognizable insignia could be treated as war criminals, and potentially be executed. It also mentions spies and defines who is a mercenary. Mercenaries and spies are considered an unlawful combatant, and not protected by the same conventions.\n\n[[Protocol II]] \"develops and supplements Article 3 [relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts] common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 without modifying its existing conditions of application\" (Article 1). Any person who does not take part in or ceased to take part in hostilities is entitled to humane treatment. Among the acts prohibited against these persons are, \"Violence to the life, health and physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular, murder as well as cruel treatment such as torture, mutilation or any form of corporal punishment\" (Article 4.a), \"Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault\" (Article 4.e), and \"Threats to commit any of the foregoing acts\" (Article 4.h).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080612085204/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol2.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.</ref> Clauses in other articles implore humane treatment of enemy personnel in an internal conflict. These have a bearing on torture, but no other clauses explicitly mention torture.\n\n===Other conventions===\nIn accordance with the optional [[UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]] (1955), ''\"[[corporal punishment]], punishment by placing in a dark cell, and all cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments shall be completely prohibited as punishments for disciplinary offences.\"''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080718003225/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_comp34.htm Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners], United Nations, Geneva, 1955.</ref> The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], (16 December 1966), explicitly prohibits torture and ''\"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\"'' by signatories.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] United Nations, 16 December 1966.</ref>\n\n;European agreements\n[[File:10CFREU-Article4.jpg|right|thumb|Article 4 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] prohibits torture.]]\n\nIn 1950 during the [[Cold War]], the participating member states of the [[Council of Europe]] signed the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

Two additional Protocols amended the Convention, which entered into force on 1 March 2002. The Convention set up the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] to oversee compliance with its provisions.\n\n;Inter-American Convention\nThe [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]], currently ratified by 18 nations of the [[Americas]] and in force since 28 February 1987, defines torture more expansively than the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\n{{quotation|For the purposes of this Convention, torture shall be understood to be any act intentionally performed whereby physical or mental pain or suffering is inflicted on a person for purposes of a criminal investigation, as a means of intimidation, as personal punishment, as a preventive measure, as a penalty, or for any other purpose.

It became a United Nations official document in 1999.\n\nUnder the provisions of [[OPCAT]] that entered into force on 22 June 2006 independent international and national bodies regularly visit places where people are deprived of their liberty, to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Each state that ratified the OPCAT, according to Article 17, is responsible for creating or maintaining at least one independent national preventive mechanism for torture prevention at the domestic level.\n\nThe European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, citing Article 1 of the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture]], states that it will, \"by means of visits, examine the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty with a view to strengthening, if necessary, the protection of such persons from torture and from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/about.htm|title=About the CPT|website=coe.int}}</ref>\n\nIn times of armed conflict between a signatory of the Geneva Conventions and another party, delegates of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) monitor the compliance of signatories to the Geneva Conventions, which includes monitoring the use of torture. Human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], the [[World Organization Against Torture]], and [[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] work actively to stop the use of torture throughout the world and publish reports on any activities they consider to be torture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apt.ch/|title=Association for the Prevention of Torture|website=apt.ch}}</ref>\n\n===Municipal law===\n[[Sovereign state|States]] that ratified the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] have a treaty obligation to include the provisions into [[municipal law]]. The laws of many states therefore formally prohibit torture. However, such ''[[de jure]]'' legal provisions are by no means a proof that, ''[[de facto]]'', the signatory country does not use torture. To prevent torture, many legal systems have a [[right against self-incrimination]] or explicitly prohibit undue force when dealing with suspects.\n\nThe French 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], of constitutional value, prohibits submitting suspects to any hardship not necessary to secure his or her person.\n\nThe [[U.S. Constitution]] and [[U.S. law]] prohibits the use of unwarranted force or coercion against any person who is subject to interrogation, detention, or arrest. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] includes protection against [[self-incrimination]], which states that \"[n]o person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\". This serves as the basis of the [[Miranda warning]], which [[Law enforcement in the United States|U.S. law enforcement personnel]] issue to individuals upon their arrest. Additionally, the U.S. Constitution's [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] forbids the use of \"[[cruel and unusual punishments]],\" which is widely interpreted as prohibiting torture. Finally, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2340<ref>{{USC|18|2340}} ''et seq''..</ref> ''et seq.'' define and forbid torture committed by U.S. nationals outside the United States or non-U.S. nationals who are present in the United States. As the United States recognizes [[customary international law]], or the [[law of nations]], the U.S. [[Alien Tort Claims Act]] and the [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] also provides legal remedies for victims of torture outside of the United States.

However, there was a clear divide between those countries with strong rejection of torture (such as Italy, where only 14% supported torture) and nations where rejection was less strong. Often this lessened rejection is found in countries severely and frequently threatened by terrorist attacks.

For this reason, some prefer methods that, while unpleasant, leave victims alive and unmarked. A victim with no visible damage may lack credibility when telling tales of torture, whereas a person missing fingernails or eyes can easily prove claims of torture. Mental torture, however, can leave scars just as deep and long-lasting as physical torture.<ref>[http://aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004a/5e.html Abu Ghraib and the ISA: What's the difference?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520150425/http://aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004a/5e.html |date=20 May 2012 }}</ref> Professional torturers in some countries have used techniques such as electrical shock, asphyxiation, heat, cold, noise, and sleep deprivation, which leave little evidence, although in other contexts torture frequently results in horrific mutilation or death.

Its effects are not immediately apparent unless they alter the [[behavior]] of the tortured person. Since there is no international political consensus on what constitutes psychological torture, it is often overlooked, denied, and referred to by different names. <ref>https://insidetime.org/great-well-of-psychiatric-morbidity</ref>\n\nPsychological torture is less well known than physical torture and tends to be subtle and much easier to conceal. In practice, the distinctions between physical and psychological torture are often blurred. <ref>https://cislacnigeria.net/understanding-nigerian-torture-prohibition-bill</ref> Physical torture is the inflicting of severe pain or suffering on a person. In contrast, psychological torture is directed at the psyche with calculated violations of psychological needs, along with deep damage to psychological structures and the breakage of beliefs underpinning normal [[sanity]]. Torturers often inflict both types of torture in combination to compound the associated effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nPsychological torture also includes deliberate use of extreme [[psychological stress|stressors]] and situations such as [[mock execution]], [[shunning]], violation of deep-seated social or [[sexual norm]]s and [[taboo]]s, or extended [[solitary confinement]].

[[Josef Mengele]] and [[Shir\u014d Ishii]] were infamous during and after [[World War II]] for their involvement in medical torture and murder. In recent years, however, there has been a push to end medical complicity in torture through both international and state-based legal strategies, as well as litigations against individual physicians.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Hoffman | first = S.

Many victims suffer from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), which includes symptoms such as flashbacks (or intrusive thoughts), severe anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, depression and memory lapses. Torture victims often feel guilt and shame, triggered by the humiliation they have endured. Many feel that they have betrayed themselves or their friends and family. All such symptoms are normal human responses to abnormal and inhuman treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/defining-torture.aspx |title= What is torture? |publisher=IRCT |accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrganizations like [[Freedom from Torture]] and the [[Center for Victims of Torture]] try to help survivors of torture obtain medical treatment and to gain [[forensic]] medical [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to obtain [[refugee|political asylum]] in a safe country or to prosecute the perpetrators.\n\nTorture is often difficult to prove, particularly when some time has passed between the event and a medical examination, or when the torturers are immune from prosecution. Many torturers around the world use methods designed to have a maximum psychological impact while leaving only minimal physical traces. Medical and Human Rights Organizations worldwide have collaborated to produce the [[Istanbul Protocol]], a document designed to outline common torture methods, consequences of torture, and medico-legal examination techniques. Typically deaths due to torture are shown in an autopsy as being due to \"natural causes\" like heart attack, inflammation, or [[embolism]] due to extreme [[stress (medicine)|stress]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://action.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/102405/\n |title       = Autopsy reports reveal homicides of detainees in U.S. custody\n |publisher   = ACLU\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060214132621/http://action.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/102405/\n |archivedate = 14 February 2006\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nFor survivors, torture often leads to lasting [[mental health|mental]] and physical health problems.\n\nPhysical problems can be wide-ranging, e.g. [[sexually transmitted diseases]], musculo-skeletal problems, [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]], post-traumatic [[epilepsy]] and [[dementia]] or chronic pain syndromes.\n\nOn 19 August 2007, the [[American Psychology Association]] (APA) voted to bar participation, to intervene to stop, and to report involvement in a wide variety of interrogation techniques as torture, including \"using [[mock execution]]s, simulated drowning, sexual and religious humiliation, stress positions or sleep deprivation\", as well as \"the exploitation of prisoners' phobias, the use of mind-altering drugs, [[hooding]], forced nakedness, the use of dogs to frighten detainees, exposing prisoners to extreme heat and cold, physical assault and threatening the use of such techniques against a prisoner or a prisoner's family.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/19/AR2007081901513.html|title=APA Rules on Interrogation Abuse|website=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the APA rejected a stronger resolution that sought to prohibit \"all psychologist involvement, either direct or indirect, in any interrogations at U.S. detention centers for foreign detainees or citizens detained outside normal legal channels.\" That resolution would have placed the APA alongside the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association in limiting professional involvement in such settings to direct patient care. The APA echoed the Bush administration by condemning isolation, sleep deprivation, and sensory deprivation or over-stimulation only when they are likely to cause lasting harm.\n\nPsychiatric treatment of torture-related medical problems might require a wide range of expertise and often specialized experience. Common treatments are [[psychotropic]] [[medication]], e.g. [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] [[antidepressants]], [[counseling]], [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]], [[family systems therapy]] and [[physiotherapy]].\n\n==Rehabilitation==\n\nThe aim of rehabilitation is to empower the torture victim to resume as full a life as possible. Rebuilding the life of someone whose dignity has been destroyed takes time and as a result, long-term material, medical, psychological and social support is needed.<ref name=\"Rehabilitation\">{{cite web|title=Rehabilitation|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/rehabilitation.aspx|website=What is torture?|publisher=International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT)|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nTreatment must be a coordinated effort that covers both physical and psychological aspects. It is important to take into consideration the patients' needs, problems, expectations, views, and cultural references.<ref name=\"Rehabilitation\"/>\n\nThe consequences of torture are likely to be influenced by many internal and external factors. Therefore, rehabilitation needs to employ different treatment approaches, taking into account the victims' individual needs, as well as the cultural, social and political environment.<ref name=\"Rehabilitation\"/>\n\nRehabilitation centres around the world, notably the members of the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]], commonly offer multi-disciplinary support and counselling, including:\n*medical attention / psychotherapeutic treatment\n*psychosocial support/trauma treatment\n*legal services and redress\n*social reintegration.\nIn the case of asylum seekers and refugees, the services may also include assisting in the documentation of torture for the asylum decision, language classes and help in finding somewhere to live and work.<ref name=\"Rehabilitation\"/>\n\n===Rehabilitation of secondary survivors===\nIn the worst case, torture can affect several generations. The physical and mental after-effects of torture often place great strain on the entire family and society. Children are particularly vulnerable. They often suffer from feelings of guilt or personal responsibility for what has happened. Therefore, other members of the survivor's family \u2013 in particular the spouse and children \u2013 are also offered treatment and counselling.<ref name=\"Rehabilitation\"/>\n\n===Broken societies===\nIn some instances, whole societies can be more or less traumatized where torture has been used in a systematic and widespread manner. In general, after years of [[Social repression|repression]], [[wikt:conflict|conflict]] and [[war]], regular support networks and structures have often been broken or destroyed.<ref name=\"Rehabilitation\"/>\n\nProviding [[peer support|psychosocial support]] and [[redress]] to survivors of torture and trauma can help reconstruct broken societies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.rct.dk/media/1195332/fieldmanual_ver1.pdf|title=Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims: Field Manual on Rehabilitation (2007)}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \"Rehabilitation centres therefore play a key role in promoting democracy, co-existence and respect for human rights.

From the FAA Air Directive: \"The potential loss of the stale-data monitoring function of the CCS when continuously powered on for 51 days, if not addressed, could result in erroneous flight-critical data being routed and displayed as valid data, which could reduce the ability of the flight crew to maintain the safe flight and landing of the airplane.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.windriver.com/products/vxworks/}}\n\n{{Intel software}}\n{{Real-time operating systems}}\n\n[[Category:ARM operating systems]]\n[[Category:Embedded operating systems]]\n[[Category:Intel software]]\n[[Category:MIPS operating systems]]\n[[Category:PowerPC operating systems]]\n[[Category:Real-time operating systems]]\n[[Category:Robot operating systems]]\n[[Category:X86 operating systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2015}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Advert|date=June 2017}}\n{{Primary sources|date=June 2014}}\n{{prose|date=July 2014}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=August 2014}}\n}}\n{{Infobox OS\n| name                   = VxWorks\n| logo                   = VxWorks symbol by Wind River Systems.png\n| logo_size              = 65px\n| screenshot             = File:VxWorks_7_Bootup_Screen.png\n| screenshot_size        = 200px\n| caption                = VxWorks 7 boot-up screen\n| developer              = [[Wind River Systems|Wind River]] (a wholly owned subsidiary of [[TPG Capital]])\n| source_model           =\n| kernel_type            = [[Monolithic kernel|Monolithic]]\n| supported_platforms    = [[x86]] (including [[Intel Quark]]), [[x86-64]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PowerPC]], [[SuperH|SH-4]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]]\n| ui                     =\n| family                 = [[Real-time operating system]]s\n| released               = {{start date and age|1987}}\n| latest_release_version = 7\n| latest_release_date    = {{start date and age|2014|03}}\n| latest_test_version    = \n| latest_test_date       =\n| marketing_target       = [[Embedded system]]s\n| updatemodel            =\n| package_manager        =\n| license                = Proprietary\n| working state          = Current\n| website                = {{URL|https://www.windriver.com/products/vxworks|Windriver.com/products/vxworks}}\n|date=August 2014}}\n\n'''VxWorks''' is a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS) developed as [[proprietary software]] by [[Wind River Systems]], a wholly owned subsidiary of TPG Capital, US.
