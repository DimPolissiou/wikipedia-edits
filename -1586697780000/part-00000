(Fenaroli Partimento No. 1, Book 1, Gj1301)]]\n[[File:Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418.jpg|thumb|right|500px| A partimenti fugue for more advanced students. As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural ''partimenti'') is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} Partimenti were central to the training of European court musicians from the late 1600s until the early 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at the [[music conservatories of Naples]], and then later at the [[Paris Conservatory]], which emulated the Neapolitan conservatories.\"<ref name=partimentoinfluence>[http://partimenti.org/partimenti/about_parti/hist_overview.html The History of Partimenti]Monuments of Partimenti</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory was greatly influenced by the [[music conservatories of Naples||music conservatories of Naples]]. As the Neapolitans did not have a class but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n== Partimento Rules ==\n\nSeveral Neapolitan teachers such as Fedele Fenaroli, Giovanni Furno and Giaocomo Insanguine published collections of ''regole'' (rules) and partimenti that were popular pedagogical materials across Europe. In particular, Fenaroli's ''Regole'' enjoyed a long publishing life, from the first edition 1775 to the final edition in 1930.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=78}}\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural ''partimenti'') is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} Partimenti were central to the training of European court musicians from the late 1600s until the early 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at the [[music conservatories of Naples]], and then later at the [[Paris Conservatory]], which emulated the Neapolitan conservatories.\"<ref name=partimentoinfluence>[http://partimenti.org/partimenti/about_parti/hist_overview.html The History of Partimenti]Monuments of Partimenti</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory was greatly influenced by the [[music conservatories of Naples||music conservatories of Naples]]. As the Neapolitans did not have a class but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n== Partimento Rules ==\n\nSeveral Neapolitan teachers such as Fedele Fenaroli, Giovanni Furno and Giaocomo Insanguine published collections of ''regole'' (rules) and partimenti that were popular pedagogical materials across Europe. In particular, Fenaroli's ''Regole'' enjoyed a long publishing life, from the first edition 1775 to the final edition in 1930.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=78}}\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony and Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and [[harmony]] in the Partimento tradition, and there was no specific class for \"Harmony\" at the Naples conservatories, where partimento was taught.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'', directed by [[Walt Dohrn]] with co-direction by David P. Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\nA celebration of the Techno Trolls is crashed by the [[Rock music|Rock Trolls]], led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her [[guitar]]'s power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still becoming adjusted to her new leadership as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land, each represented by a different style of music that is powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having split into their different forms of music following discord and disagreement over which was the best, Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power chord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with [[rock]].\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.\n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, has been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy the truth about what happened, and Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop music|Pop]] and [[Funk]], and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop music|Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls [[hijack]] the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory tries to urge her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. \n\nBiggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.\n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending [[music]], and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb\u2019s anguish.\n\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of soundmaking, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to [[sing]] together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of [[music]] are, and encouraged by her father Thrash, Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship. \n\nBranch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events that have taken place, and worried they have missed the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the optimistic Queen of the pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls and Barb's father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll and Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'', directed by [[Walt Dohrn]] with co-direction by David P. Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\nA celebration of the Techno Trolls is crashed by the [[Rock music|Rock Trolls]], led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her [[guitar]]'s power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still becoming adjusted to her new leadership as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land, each represented by a different style of music that is powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having split into their different forms of music following discord and disagreement over which was the best, Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power chord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with [[rock]].\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.\n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, has been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy the truth about what happened, and Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop music|Pop]] and [[Funk]], and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop music|Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls [[hijack]] the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory tries to urge her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. \n\nBiggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.\n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending [[music]], and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb\u2019s anguish.\n\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of soundmaking, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to [[sing]] together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of [[music]] are, and encouraged by her father Thrash, Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship. \n\nBranch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events that have taken place, and worried they have missed the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the optimistic Queen of the pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls and Barb's father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll and Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.

When ''X \u2297 Y'' is endowed with this topology then it is denoted by <math>X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y</math> and called the '''projective tensor product''' of ''X'' and ''Y''. \n\n== Preliminaries ==\n\n=== A canonical tensor product as a subspace of the dual of Bi(X, Y) ===\nLet ''X'' and ''Y'' be vector spaces (no topology is needed yet) and let ''Bi(X, Y)'' be the space of all [[bilinear map]]s defined on <math>X \\times Y</math> and going into the underlying scalar field. \n\nFor every <math>(x, y) \\in X \\times Y</math> define a canonical bilinear form by <math>\\chi_{(x, y)}</math> with domain ''Bi(X, Y)'' by <math>\\chi_{(x, y)}(u) := u(x, y)</math> for every <math>u \\in Bi(X, Y)</math>. \nThis induces a canonical map <math>\\chi : X \\times Y \\to Bi(X, Y)^{\\#}</math> defined by <math>\\chi(x, y) = \\chi_{(x, y)}</math>, where <math>Bi(X, Y)^{\\#}</math> denotes the [[algebraic dual]] of ''Bi(X, Y)''.  \nIf we denote the span of the range of ''\ud835\udf12'' by ''X \u2297 Y'' then ''X \u2297 Y'' together with ''\ud835\udf12'' forms a [[tensor product]] of ''X'' and ''Y'' (where ''x \u2297 y = \ud835\udf12(x, y)''). This gives us a canonical tensor product of ''X'' and ''Y''. \n\nIf ''Z'' is any other vector space then the mapping <math>Li(X \\otimes Y; Z) \\to Bi(X, Y; Z)</math> given by <math>u \\mapsto u \\circ \\chi</math> is an isomorphism of vector spaces. In particular, this allows us to identify the [[algebraic dual]] of ''X \u2297 Y'' with the space of bilinear forms on <math>X \\times Y</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=92}} Moreover, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are locally convex [[Topological Vector Space]]s (TVSs) and if ''X \u2297 Y'' is given the \ud835\udf0b-topology then for every locally convex TVS ''Z'', this map restricts to a vector space isomorphism <math>L(X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y; Z) \\to B(X, Y; Z)</math> from the space of ''continuous'' linear mappings onto the space of ''continuous'' bilinear mappings.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}} In particular, the continuous dual of ''X \u2297 Y'' can be canonically identified with the space ''B(X, Y)'' of continuous bilinear forms on <math>X \\times Y</math>; furthermore, under this identification the [[equicontinuous]] subsets of ''B(X, Y)'' are the same as the equicontinuous subsets of ''<math>(X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y)^{\\prime}</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}}\n\n== The projective tensor product ==\n=== Tensor product of seminorms ===\nThroughout we will let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[locally convex]] [[topological vector spaces]] (local convexity allows us to define useful topologies{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}}). \nIf ''p'' is a seminorm on ''X'' then <math>C_p := \\{ x \\in X : p(x) \\leq 1 \\}</math> will be its closed unit ball. \n\nIf ''p'' is a seminorm on ''X'' and ''q'' is a seminorm on ''Y'' then we can define the '''tensor product of ''p'' and ''q''''' to be the map ''p \u2297 q'' defined on ''X \u2297 Y'' by \n: <math>(p \\otimes q)(b) := \\inf_{r > 0, b \\in r W} r</math>\nwhere ''W'' is the [[balanced]] convex hull of <math>C_p \\otimes C_q = \\left\\{ x \\otimes y : p(x) \\leq 1, q(y) \\leq 1 \\right\\}</math>. \nGiven ''b'' in ''X \u2297 Y'', this can also be expressed as{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=435}}\n: <math>(p \\otimes q)(b) := \\inf \\sum_i p(x_i) q(y_i)</math>\nwhere the infimum is taken over all finite sequences <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in X</math> and <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\in Y</math> (of the same length) such that <math>b = x_1 \\otimes y_1 + \\cdots + x_n \\otimes y_n</math> (recall that it may not be possible to express ''b'' as a [[simple tensor]]). \nIf ''b = x\u2297y'' then we have\n: <math>(p \\otimes q)(x \\otimes y) = p(x) q(y)</math>.\nThe seminorm ''p \u2297 q'' is a norm if and only if both ''p'' and ''q'' are norms.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=437}} \n\nIf the topology of ''X'' (resp.

In particular, if <math>u : X_1 \\to Y_1</math> and <math>v : X_2 \\to Y_2</math> are continuous linear maps between locally convex spaces then their tensor product <math>u \\otimes v : X_1 \\otimes_{\\pi} X_2 \\to Y_1 \\otimes_{\\pi} Y_2 \\subseteq Y_1 \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y_2</math>, which is necessarily continuous, can be extended to a unique continuous linear function <math>u \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} v : X_1 \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} X_2 \\to Y_1 \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y_2</math>, which may also be denoted by <math>u \\widehat{\\otimes} v</math> if no ambiguity would arise. \n\nNote that if ''X'' and ''Y'' are metrizable then so are <math>X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y</math> and <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math>, where in particular <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math> will be an [[F-space]]. \n\n=== Grothendieck's representation of elements of <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math> ===\n\nRecall that in a Hausdorff locally convex space ''X'', a sequence <math>\\left( x_i \\right)_{i=1}^{\\infty}</math> in ''X'' is '''absolutely convergent''' if <math>\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} p \\left( x_i \\right) < \\infty</math> for every continuous seminorm ''p'' on ''X''.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=120}} We write <math>x = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} x_i</math> if the sequence of partial sums <math>\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> converges to ''x'' in ''X''.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=120}} \n\nThe following fundamental result in the theory of topological tensor products is due to [[Alexander Grothendieck]].{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=94}} \n\n'''Theorem''' Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be metrizable locally convex TVSs and let <math>z \\in X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math>.

This gives us a canonical tensor product of ''X'' and ''Y''. \n\nIf ''Z'' is any other vector space then the mapping <math>Li(X \\otimes Y; Z) \\to Bi(X, Y; Z)</math> given by <math>u \\mapsto u \\circ \\chi</math> is an isomorphism of vector spaces. In particular, this allows us to identify the [[algebraic dual]] of ''X \u2297 Y'' with the space of bilinear forms on <math>X \\times Y</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=92}} Moreover, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are locally convex [[Topological Vector Space]]s (TVSs) and if ''X \u2297 Y'' is given the \ud835\udf0b-topology then for every locally convex TVS ''Z'', this map restricts to a vector space isomorphism <math>L(X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y; Z) \\to B(X, Y; Z)</math> from the space of ''continuous'' linear mappings onto the space of ''continuous'' bilinear mappings.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}} In particular, the continuous dual of ''X \u2297 Y'' can be canonically identified with the space ''B(X, Y)'' of continuous bilinear forms on <math>X \\times Y</math>; furthermore, under this identification the [[equicontinuous]] subsets of ''B(X, Y)'' are the same as the equicontinuous subsets of ''<math>(X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y)^{\\prime}</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}}\n\n== The projective tensor product ==\n=== Tensor product of seminorms ===\nThroughout we will let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[locally convex]] [[topological vector spaces]] (local convexity allows us to define useful topologies{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}}). \nIf ''p'' is a seminorm on ''X'' then <math>C_p := \\{ x \\in X : p(x) \\leq 1 \\}</math> will be its closed unit ball. \n\nIf ''p'' is a seminorm on ''X'' and ''q'' is a seminorm on ''Y'' then we can define the '''tensor product of ''p'' and ''q''''' to be the map ''p \u2297 q'' defined on ''X \u2297 Y'' by \n: <math>(p \\otimes q)(b) := \\inf_{r > 0, b \\in r W} r</math>\nwhere ''W'' is the [[balanced]] convex hull of <math>C_p \\otimes C_q = \\left\\{ x \\otimes y : p(x) \\leq 1, q(y) \\leq 1 \\right\\}</math>. \nGiven ''b'' in ''X \u2297 Y'', this can also be expressed as{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=435}}\n: <math>(p \\otimes q)(b) := \\inf \\sum_i p(x_i) q(y_i)</math>\nwhere the infimum is taken over all finite sequences <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in X</math> and <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\in Y</math> (of the same length) such that <math>b = x_1 \\otimes y_1 + \\cdots + x_n \\otimes y_n</math> (recall that it may not be possible to express ''b'' as a [[simple tensor]]). \nIf ''b = x\u2297y'' then we have\n: <math>(p \\otimes q)(x \\otimes y) = p(x) q(y)</math>.\nThe seminorm ''p \u2297 q'' is a norm if and only if both ''p'' and ''q'' are norms.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=437}} \n\nIf the topology of ''X'' (resp.

In particular, if <math>u : X_1 \\to Y_1</math> and <math>v : X_2 \\to Y_2</math> are continuous linear maps between locally convex spaces then their tensor product <math>u \\otimes v : X_1 \\otimes_{\\pi} X_2 \\to Y_1 \\otimes_{\\pi} Y_2 \\subseteq Y_1 \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y_2</math>, which is necessarily continuous, can be extended to a unique continuous linear function <math>u \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} v : X_1 \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} X_2 \\to Y_1 \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y_2</math>, which may also be denoted by <math>u \\widehat{\\otimes} v</math> if no ambiguity would arise. \n\nNote that if ''X'' and ''Y'' are metrizable then so are <math>X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y</math> and <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math>, where in particular <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math> will be an [[F-space]]. \n\n=== Grothendieck's representation of elements of <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math> ===\n\nRecall that in a Hausdorff locally convex space ''X'', a sequence <math>\\left( x_i \\right)_{i=1}^{\\infty}</math> in ''X'' is '''absolutely convergent''' if <math>\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} p \\left( x_i \\right) < \\infty</math> for every continuous seminorm ''p'' on ''X''.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=120}} We write <math>x = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} x_i</math> if the sequence of partial sums <math>\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> converges to ''x'' in ''X''.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=120}} \n\nThe following fundamental result in the theory of topological tensor products is due to [[Alexander Grothendieck]].{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=94}} \n\n'''Theorem''' Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be metrizable locally convex TVSs and let <math>z \\in X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math>.

By the late 1930s NHK's overseas broadcasts were known as '''Radio Tokyo''', which became an official name in 1941.\n\nIn November 1941, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] nationalised all public news agencies and coordinated their efforts via the Information Liaison Confidential Committee.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} All published and broadcast news reports became official announcements of the Imperial Army General Headquarters in Tokyo for the duration of [[World War II]].

Japanese-American radio broadcaster [[Frank Shozo Baba]] joined NHK during this time and led an early post-war revamp of its programming. Radio Japan resumed overseas broadcasts in 1952.\n\nA new Broadcasting Act (\"H\u014ds\u014d H\u014d\") was enacted in 1950, which made NHK a listener-supported independent corporation and simultaneously opened the market for [[commercial broadcasting]] in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p08/index.html|title=Broadcast Law: Broadcasting for the Public|accessdate=27 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018085435/http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p08/index.html|archivedate=18 October 2015}}</ref> NHK started [[television]] broadcasting in the same year, followed by its Educational TV channel in 1959 and color television broadcasts in 1960.\n\nNHK opened the first stage of [[NHK Broadcasting Center|its current headquarters]] in the [[special wards of Tokyo|special ward]] of [[Tokyo|Japan's capital city]] [[Shibuya]] as an international broadcasting center for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], the first widely televised Olympic Games.
