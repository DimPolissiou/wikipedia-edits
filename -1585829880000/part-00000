In 1864, Shimla was declared as the [[summer capital]] of [[British Raj|British India]], succeeding [[Murree]], northeast of [[Rawalpindi]]. After [[Indian independence movement|independence]], the city became the capital of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and was later made the capital of [[Himachal Pradesh]].

The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of [[Himalayas]]. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Accord of 1914]] and the [[Simla Conference]] of 1945. After independence, The state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 [[princely state]]s. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the [[Simla Agreement]] of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla.\n\nShimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the [[Tudorbethan]] and [[neo-Gothic]] architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]], the [[Jakhoo|Jakhoo Temple]], the [[Mall Road, Shimla|Mall Road]], [[The Ridge, Shimla|the Ridge]] and [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]] which together form the city centre. The [[Kalka\u2013Shimla Railway]] line built by the British, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race [[MTB Himalaya]], which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest [[Ice rink|natural ice skating rink]] in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions.\n\n==History==\nMost of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the [[Jakhoo]] temple and a few scattered houses.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\">{{cite book | author=Vipin Pubby | title=Shimla Then and Now | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrZ-ibfhMyMC&pg=PA17 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | year=1996 | publisher=Indus Publishing | isbn=978-81-7387-046-0 | pages=17\u201334}}</ref> The area was called 'Shimla', named after a [[Hindu goddess]], ''Shyamala Devi'', an incarnation of [[Kali]].<ref name=\"hpshimla.nic.in\"/>\n\n[[File:Shimla, 1850s.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s]]\nThe area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by [[Bhimsen Thapa]] of [[Nepal]] in 1806. The [[British East India Company]] took control of the territory as per the [[Sugauli Treaty]] after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814\u201316). The [[Gurkha]] leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of [[David Ochterlony]] in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as \"a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers\". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the [[Hill States of India#|Hill States]], set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] civil servant [[Charles Pratt Kennedy]] built the first [[pucca housing|pucca house]] in the area in 1822, near [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]], what is now the [[Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]], the [[Governor-General of Bengal]], visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]], the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near [[Jakhoo]]. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of [[Keonthal]] and [[Patiala]] in exchange for the Rawin [[pargana]] and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Harrop, F.

In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:<ref>Researches and Missionary Labours Among the Jews, Mohammedans, and Other Sects By Joseph Wolff, published by O.

After this, the town was under Nawab (King) Kumar Ghosal of Bally, West Bengal and saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from [[Sood]] and [[Parsi]] communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]] was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the [[National Highway 22 (India)|Hindustan-Tibet road]] with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851\u201352. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851\u201352.<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080206/himplus1.htm#2 |title=Shimla A five-tunnel town|publisher=tribuneindia.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> The [[1857 uprising]] caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/>\n\nIn 1863, the [[Viceroy of India]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]], decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\" /> He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between [[Calcutta]] and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], ''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007</ref> [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] ([[Viceroy of India]] 1876\u20131880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the \"Upper Bazaar\" nowadays known as the [[The Ridge, Shimla|Ridge]]<ref name=\"harisud\">{{cite book | author=Hari Sud | title=Entrepreneurs of British Shimla | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8aRBQAAQBAJ | accessdate=15 August 2015 | year=2013 | publisher=Lulu | isbn=978-1-304-11357-3 | pages=73\u201374}}</ref>), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration.\n\nDuring the \"Hot Weather\", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], the head of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], and many departments of [[Government of India|the government]]. The summer capital of the regional Government of the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] moved from [[Murree]], in modern-day [[Pakistan]], to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]],<ref>''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007: p. 134</ref> \"was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust.\" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as [[Rudyard Kipling]] said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for \"frivolity, gossip and intrigue\".<ref name=\"heritagereport\">{{cite web | url = http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | title = Heritage of Shimla | publisher = Town & Country Planning Department, Shimla | accessdate = 4 May 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171701/http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | archivedate = 30 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|500|ft|adj=on}} Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang.

The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]], the [[Jakhoo|Jakhoo Temple]], the [[Mall Road, Shimla|Mall Road]], [[The Ridge, Shimla|the Ridge]] and [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]] which together form the city centre. The [[Kalka\u2013Shimla Railway]] line built by the British, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race [[MTB Himalaya]], which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest [[Ice rink|natural ice skating rink]] in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions.\n\n==History==\nMost of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the [[Jakhoo]] temple and a few scattered houses.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\">{{cite book | author=Vipin Pubby | title=Shimla Then and Now | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrZ-ibfhMyMC&pg=PA17 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | year=1996 | publisher=Indus Publishing | isbn=978-81-7387-046-0 | pages=17\u201334}}</ref> The area was called 'Shimla', named after a [[Hindu goddess]], ''Shyamala Devi'', an incarnation of [[Kali]].<ref name=\"hpshimla.nic.in\"/>\n\n[[File:Shimla, 1850s.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s]]\nThe area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by [[Bhimsen Thapa]] of [[Nepal]] in 1806. The [[British East India Company]] took control of the territory as per the [[Sugauli Treaty]] after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814\u201316). The [[Gurkha]] leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of [[David Ochterlony]] in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as \"a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers\". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the [[Hill States of India#|Hill States]], set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] civil servant [[Charles Pratt Kennedy]] built the first [[pucca housing|pucca house]] in the area in 1822, near [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]], what is now the [[Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]], the [[Governor-General of Bengal]], visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]], the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near [[Jakhoo]]. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of [[Keonthal]] and [[Patiala]] in exchange for the Rawin [[pargana]] and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Harrop, F.

In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:<ref>Researches and Missionary Labours Among the Jews, Mohammedans, and Other Sects By Joseph Wolff, published by O.

After this, the town was under Nawab (King) Kumar Ghosal of Bally, West Bengal and saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from [[Sood]] and [[Parsi]] communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]] was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the [[National Highway 22 (India)|Hindustan-Tibet road]] with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851\u201352. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851\u201352.<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080206/himplus1.htm#2 |title=Shimla A five-tunnel town|publisher=tribuneindia.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> The [[1857 uprising]] caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/>\n\nIn 1863, the [[Viceroy of India]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]], decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\" /> He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between [[Calcutta]] and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], ''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007</ref> [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] ([[Viceroy of India]] 1876\u20131880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the \"Upper Bazaar\" nowadays known as the [[The Ridge, Shimla|Ridge]]<ref name=\"harisud\">{{cite book | author=Hari Sud | title=Entrepreneurs of British Shimla | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8aRBQAAQBAJ | accessdate=15 August 2015 | year=2013 | publisher=Lulu | isbn=978-1-304-11357-3 | pages=73\u201374}}</ref>), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration.\n\nDuring the \"Hot Weather\", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], the head of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], and many departments of [[Government of India|the government]]. The summer capital of the regional Government of the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] moved from [[Murree]], in modern-day [[Pakistan]], to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]],<ref>''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007: p. 134</ref> \"was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust.\" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as [[Rudyard Kipling]] said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for \"frivolity, gossip and intrigue\".<ref name=\"heritagereport\">{{cite web | url = http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | title = Heritage of Shimla | publisher = Town & Country Planning Department, Shimla | accessdate = 4 May 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171701/http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | archivedate = 30 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|500|ft|adj=on}} Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang.

Other forms of classification, such as [[sexual orientation]], [[religion]], or [[ageing|age]], apply to this theory as well.

Characteristics such as race, age, and sex, may affect an individual in extremely different ways, in such simple cases as varying geography, socioeconomic status, or simply throughout time. Other scholars such as Kimberle Crenshaw's ''Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color'' are credited with expanding Collins' work.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|date=1991|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color |journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1241\u20131299|doi=10.2307/1229039|jstor=1229039|citeseerx=10.1.1.695.5934}}</ref> The matrix of domination is a way for people to acknowledge their privileges in society.

This is a problem that can be seen in the law as well when it comes to discrimination because the courts fail to view discrimination as an overarching umbrella of intersectionality.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cousins|first1=Oswald B.|title=The Judicial Approach to Intersectional Discrimination: Significant Decisions from a Defense Perspective|date=November 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA way in which the matrix of domination works with regards to privilege can be if two people all have the same classification, except one person has an education and one does not have as high of an education. Their gender, race, sexuality, educational attainment all intersect to identify who they are. However, compared to other people one classification can point out privilege and, in turn, open more opportunities for one individual over the other.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOne of the main aspects of the matrix of domination is the fact that one may be privileged in one area, yet they can be oppressed in a different aspect of their identity. Some people believe that racial discrimination is on its way to being eradicated from the United States when they look as people like Colin Powell, a very successful, African-American, middle-aged man. Although Powell obtains the characteristics of a person that may not face oppression (upper-class, middle-aged, male), he is still discriminated against because of his race. This shows one of the key components of the matrix of domination; the idea that one cannot look at the individual facets of someone's identity, but rather that they are all interconnected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rampages.us/oliviapryor/tag/matrix-of-domination/|title=matrix of domination {{!}} A so-sociologist|website=rampages.us|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref>\n\n== Matrix of domination compared to intersectionality ==\n\n=== Historical background on the matrix of domination ===\nIn Collins\u2019 ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment'', she first describes the concept of matrix thinking within the context of how black women in America encounter institutional discrimination based upon their race and gender.<ref name=\":02\">Collins, Patricia Hill. (2000) ''Black Feminist Thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment''. New York, Routledge.</ref> A prominent example of this in the 1990s was racial segregation, especially as it related to housing, education, and employment. At the time, there was very little encouraged interaction between whites and blacks in these common sectors of society. Collins argues that this demonstrates how being black and female in America continues to perpetuate certain common experiences for African-American women. As such, African-American women live in a different world than those who are not black and female.<ref name=\":02\" /> Collins notes how this shared social struggle can actually result in the formation of a group-based collective effort, citing how the high concentration of African-American women in the domestic labor sector in combination with racial segregation in housing and schooling contributed directly to the organization of the black feminist movement.<ref name=\":02\" /> The collective wisdom shared by black women that held these specific experiences constituted a distinct viewpoint for African-American women concerning correlations between their race and gender and the resulting economic consequences.\n\nMoolman points out the main issue concerning matrix thinking is how one accounts for the power dynamics between varying identifying categories that are ingrained in both oppression and domination instead of the traditional approach, reducing experiences to a single identity.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Rethinking 'masculinities in transition' in South Africa considering the 'intersectionality' of race, class, and sexuality with gender|journal = African Identities|volume = 11|pages = 93\u2013105|last=Moolman|first=Benita|date=2013|doi=10.1080/14725843.2013.775843}}</ref> For instance, black women's experiences with society are used to illustrate how even though white scholars have attempted to use intersectionality in their research, they may still be inclined to default towards single-identity thinking that often fails to address all aspects of black women's experiences, thus ignoring the organization the matrix objectively offers.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281204860|title=Pursuing Intersectionality, Unsettling Dominant Imaginaries|last=May|first=Vivian|date=2015-01-01|isbn=9780415808408}}</ref>\n\nThe matrix of domination in the colonial era and white society has also been carefully examined. The societal hierarchy determined by race and implemented under apartheid locates different racial populations in regards to their privilege, with African Americans usually at the bottom of the ladder. Dhamoon argues that on a global scale, the spot occupied by African Americans in such context is interchangeable with indigenous populations, as marginalized peoples are systematically working both within and across a matrix of interrelated axes of \"penalty and privilege\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.feralfeminisms.com/rita-dhamoon/|title=A FEMINIST APPROACH TO DECOLONIZING ANTI-RACISM: RETHINKING TRANSNATIONALISM, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND SETTLER COLONIALISM|website=feralfeminisms.com|access-date=2018-03-31}}</ref> The interconnectivity of different identities in regards to power in racial structures in post-colonial era societies help illustrate what changes make a difference. The framework setup of the matrix of domination connects its origin theory and thought to existing struggles in the political and social spheres of society. A closer look at both specific and broader aspects of matrix thought will shed more light on the inner-workings and mechanisms that determine how different relationship dynamics influence matrix categorizations.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMay cites that an important implication that matrix thinking inspires is that it directly goes against what is often described as the socially inclusive \u2018add and stir\u2019 approach.<ref name=\":12\" /> This is often used when describing the addition of one or more identity group to existing epistemological approaches, political strategies or research methodologies. This accounts for the proper weighing of power dynamics and their impact on different groups of people. Intersectionality centers power in a multi-pronged way as shifting across different sites and scales at the same time. Therefore, it is not neutral but evolved out of histories of struggle that pursue multidimensional forms of justice.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Historical background on intersectionality ===\n[[Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw|Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw]], the founder of the term [[intersectionality]], brought national and scholarly credential to the term through the paper ''Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics'' in The University of Chicago Legal Forum.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|date=|title=Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&context=uclf|journal=Chicago Unbound|volume=|pages=139\u2013167|via=}}</ref> In the paper, she uses intersectionality to reveal how feminist movements and antiracist movements exclude women of color.  Focusing on the experiences of Black women, she dissects several court cases, influential pieces of literature, personal experiences, and doctrinal manifestations as evidence for the way Black women are oppressed through many different experiences, systems and groups.\n\nThough the specifics differ, the basic argument is the same: Black women are oppressed in a multitude of situations because people are unable to see how their identities intersect and influence each other. Feminism has been crafted for white middle-class women, only considering problems that affect this group of people. Unfortunately, this only captures a small facet of the oppression women face. By catering to the most privileged women and addressing only the problems they face, feminism alienates women of color and lower-class women by refusing to accept the way other forms of oppression feed into the sexism they face. Not only does feminism completely disregard the experiences of women of color, it also solidifies the connection between womanhood and whiteness when feminists speak for \"all women\".<ref name=\":6\" /> (Crenshaw:154) Oppression cannot be detangled or separated easily in the same way identities cannot be separated easily. It is impossible to address the problem of sexism without addressing racism, as many women experience both racism and sexism. This theory can also be applied to the antiracist movement, which rarely addresses the problem of sexism, even though it is thoroughly intertwined with the problem of racism. Feminism remains white, and antiracism remains male. In essence, any theory that tries to measure the extent and manner of oppression Black women face will be wholly incorrect without using intersectionality.\n\nPatricia Hill Collins wrote a book entitled ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment'', which articulated \"Black Feminist Thought\" in relation to  intersectionality with a focus on the plight of Black women in face of the world, the white feminist movement, and the male antiracism movement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment|last=Collins|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Collins references Crenshaw's concept of intersectionality and relates it to the matrix of domination, \"The term matrix of domination describes this overall social organization within which intersecting oppressions originate, develop, and are contained.\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment|last=Collins|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=227}}</ref>\n\n=== Intersectionality and the matrix of domination ===\nBoth intersectionality and the matrix of domination help sociologists understand power relationships and systems of oppression in society.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gouws|first=Amanda|date=June 2017|title=Feminist intersectionality and the matrix of domination in South Africa|journal=Agenda|volume=31|pages=19\u201327|doi=10.1080/10130950.2017.1338871}}</ref> The matrix of domination looks at the overall organization of power in society while intersectionality is used to understand a specific social location of an identity using mutually constructing features of oppression.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe concept of intersectionality today is used to move away from one dimensional thinking in the matrix of domination approach by allowing for different power dynamics of different identity categories at the same time.

Several sociological studies on the welfare state take note of state-market relations while ignoring the salient roles held by other identities such as gender, race, class, language, and age, among others.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Politics, Gender, and Concepts|last=Mazur|first=Amy G.|last2=Goertz|first2=Gary|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521897761|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}</ref> Due to the nature of the welfare state, there has not been much regard for exploring the existence of multiple axes of oppression which has led to lineation of categories of race, class, and gender.<ref name=\":5\" /> In ''Politics, Gender, and Concepts'', Gary Goertz and Amy Mazur assert that literature about the welfare state should focus on the relationship between social positions and social policies, as well as provide a framework for investigations into the causal effects of class, gender, and race. As such, using the idea of a matrix of domination in these kinds of studies provides a basis for empirical research on the relationship between social positions and policies, and also, for a comparison between the outcomes of social policies on marginalized and privileged women.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Intersectionality of gender and class ==\n\n=== Benefits among class ===\n\nThe benefits that upper-class citizens receive from their employer are far different from that of working-class employees. This is due to the upper class taking jobs that give them a higher status or position, whereas the working class take jobs with lower status such as retail and blue-collar jobs.<ref name=\"Pacific Standard\">{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/economics/work-life-balance-benefits-low-wage-workers-employers-35733.|title=Work-Life Balance Benefits Low-Wage Workers, Employers|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}</ref> The most obvious benefit that differs between classes is the amount of money made. Upper-class workers receive significantly more pay than the working class, and while the upper class receive salaries, the lower class typically receive their pay based off hourly wages.<ref name=\"Pacific Standard\"/> Moreover, the chance of getting a raise is greater for the higher-ups. More benefits that the upper class enjoy over the working class are vacation time, flexible hours, retirement savings, and greater coverage of healthcare and insurance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://workingclassstudies.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/who-is-working-class/|title=Who is working class?|date=2008-07-28|work=Working-Class Perspectives|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Benefits among gender ===\n\nWhen it comes to workplace benefits such as health insurance coverage, pensions, sick leave, and disability plans, there are gender differences in whether or not these benefits are offered. Women are less likely to be offered pensions, health coverage and disability plans. In fact, high poverty rates among elderly women have been linked to lack of pension coverage. Additionally, many female heads of household remain on welfare because they cannot find jobs with adequate health insurance coverage. When it comes to union contracts, men are also twice as likely to be covered.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.3386/w4265 |title=Gender Gaps in Benefits Coverage |last=Currie |first=Janet |date=January 1993 |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 4265 }}</ref> This gender gap in benefits coverage may be due to the fact that women tend to have higher medical expenditures than males of the same age. As a result, some of the observed gap in wages between males and females in the United States could be the result of employers compensating for the higher cost of employer-sponsored health insurance. This further perpetuates gender discrimination because it means that firms who offer ESI (Employer Sponsored Insurance) will prefer to hire males. Another effect of women generally having greater healthcare expenses than men is that they are likely to place a higher value on insurance and be more inclined to pass up jobs for insurance-related reasons. This lowers the probability of obtaining jobs that pay higher wages directly and decrease a woman's bargaining power with her current employer. Indeed, health insurance has a larger (negative) effect on the job mobility of women, which they attribute to women's elevated healthcare expenses.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-01-01|title=Employer-sponsored health insurance and the gender wage gap |journal=Journal of Health Economics|language=en|volume=45|pages=103\u2013114|doi=10.1016/j.jhealeco.2015.09.008|pmid=26614691 |issn=0167-6296|last1=Cowan |first1=Benjamin |last2=Schwab |first2=Benjamin }}</ref>\n\n=== Wage gap among class ===\n\nIn the United States there is an unequal distribution of income between social classes for multiple reasons. Level of education has a great influence on average salaries. The higher the socioeconomic status (SES) of an individual the more likely they are to graduate from high school and potentially obtain a college degree, which in return increases their chances of a larger salary. The average salary of an individual with a high school diploma is about $35,000, but increases to about $60,000 by obtaining a bachelor's degree after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smartasset.com/retirement/the-average-salary-by-education-level|title=The Average Salary by Education Level - SmartAsset|website=SmartAsset|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref> The gap in salary increases with each additional level of education received. Those in the lower class face more obstacles and have less opportunities to pursue additional education due to their lack of resources. The wage gap is even larger for individuals affected by poverty and racial barriers. Whites have a median income of about $71,000 while blacks have a median income of about $43,000.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/1-demographic-trends-and-economic-well-being/|title=1.

Individuals in poverty already face a disadvantage in obtaining the same level of income as their upper class coworkers, but when also affected by racial barriers the chances of reaching the same income are even fewer.\n\n=== Wage gap among gender ===\n\nThere is definitely intersectionality and inequality with women and men when it comes to wage gaps. Careers that pay well are often male dominated, and do not tolerate women and their personal needs. There has been a stable \"pay gap\" between men and women which has remained between 10-20% difference in their average earnings. (Women, careers and work life preferences).  When discussing wage gaps between genders, scientists takes into account two questions, the first being \"is there differential access jobs on the basis of gender?\" and the second being, \"is women\u2019s work perceived to have less value than comparable work done by men?\".  When women begin to increase their numbers in certain job positions the status or value of the job decreases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hakim|first=Catherine|date=18 January 2017|title=Women, careers, and work-life preferences|journal= British Journal of Guidance & Counselling|volume=34|issue=3|pages=279\u2013294|doi=10.1080/03069880600769118|citeseerx=10.1.1.463.726}}</ref> Conceptualizing intersectionality through class, gender and race then identifying the barriers that create inequality in Work organizations is found in the idea of \"inequality regimes\".

In television and popular culture, those who fall into the lower class are often portrayed differently based on if they are a woman or a man. If they are a woman, they often are portrayed as being more intelligent and responsible than their husbands, almost acting as their mothers.<ref name=\":1\"/> The male head of the household is typically portrayed as being less intelligent, with some redeeming qualities, but typically is not respected.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/socialclass.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television - Social Class and Television|website=www.museum.tv|access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref> Together they can be shown in a light that makes them seem lazy or dishonest.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woods|first=Taniesha|date=October 25, 2004|title=The Development of Stereotypes About the Rich and Poor: Age, Race, and Family Income Differences in Beliefs|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/108157/Stereotype%20Development.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=34|pages=|via=}}</ref> The upper class however, does not face these same issues with representation in the media. The man of the household takes on stereotypical male qualities, while the woman takes on stereotypical female qualities. The children in this upper class scenario are what provides entertainment value, rather than focusing on the unintelligent and unorganized adults as in the lower class model.<ref name=\":1\" /> Overall, in the upper-class family unit, they are portrayed as organized and put together, while the lower class model are portrayed as lazy and unorganized.\n\n=== Representation among gender ===\n\nIn American society and many other societies around the world, being a largely represented group in a position of power means that one has succeeded in life. Whether one is a manager of a fast food restaurant or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, authority is power and power is advantage. But just like the widespread power struggle, there is a widespread equality struggle. One of the largest workplace and societal inequalities is the inequality between genders. A prime example of this is the wage gap. Women in 2016 earned, on average, 82 cents to a man's dollar. This unequal pay is part of the reason that many women are the ones to leave the workforce when it is determined that a stay-at-home parent is required; if women are contributing less to the household income, it will make less of an impact if they quit their jobs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/04/pf/equal-pay-day-gender-pay-gap/index.html|title=5 things to know about the gender pay gap|last=Vasel|first=Kathryn|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref> Women are also not granted the same opportunities for employment as men. A clear example is the U.S. military. Women were banned from all combat roles until recently. In 2011, only 14 percent of the armed forces were female, and only 14 percent of officers were female.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/01/24/us/military-women-glance/index.html|title=By the numbers: Women in the U.S. military|author=CNN Staff|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref> Another example is the U.S. congress.

Some countries place strict limitations on women, not allowing them to vote or work or even drive a car. While the U.S. is seen as a country of dreams and opportunity, is far easier to see this when compared to an even more unequal country. The United States has been trending toward gender equality in recent years, but it has a while to go.\n\n=== Research contributions ===\n\nAn article found in the November 1998 issue of ''Social Problems'' details the conflict involving racial domination by identifying the complexity African-Americans face.  In many cases, sociologists and laypersons alike are often limited in their approach to the problem.  Michelle Byng, in \"Mediating Discrimination: Oppression among African-American Muslim Women\"\u2014the 1998 article\u2014brings to focus new approaches to understanding discrimination, but also, she writes to illustrate the many overlooked opportunities in which the discriminated are able to empower themselves in certain situations.\n\n==Intersectionality in court cases==\nThere are countless numbers of court cases that examine intersectionality within the workforce that did not allow individuals to have equal opportunities because of their race, gender, and social class.\n\nThe case, ''DeGraffenreid vs. General Motors'', provides an example when the law does an injustice to those that face discrimination. Five black female production workers were laid off, and took it to court claiming that the company was violating [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] because, \"it perpetrated past discriminatory practices of not hiring Black females.\" The court looked at each of the categories, race and gender, separately therefore they missed the discrimination of a person being both African-American and female. \"It was argued, black women can expect little protection as long as approaches, such as that in DeGraffenreid, which completely obscure problems of intersectionality prevail.\"<ref>Cousins, Oswald B. (November 10, 2017). \"The Judicial Approach to Intersectional Discrimination: Significant Decisions from a Defense Perspective\".</ref>\n\nAnother case, ''Maivan Lam v. University of Hawai'i'', where intersectionality was the core reason behind the problem that emerged. Maivan Lam was not offered a job twice when she applied to be the Director of the Law School's Pacific Asian Legal Studies Program. Two times, the university was looking for a director and when the final offer came around, and she was the best candidate available, the university simply cancelled their search. In the first search, Professor Lam made it to the final round, but was not offered the job before the whole search was simply shut down. The second time, the position was offered to another candidate and the other candidate refused to accept, the search was simply cancelled without it being offered to Professor Lam. When Lam brought this situation up to the Dean, he suggested reopening the search so that male candidates who had not applied on time could submit their applications. It is stated, \"Early in the 1989-90 academic year, the new appointments committee reviewed applications for a commercial law position. At one meeting, a male committee member stated that the Law School should not have two women teaching commercial law. This comment was reported to the Dean, who said that he recognized that the professor had difficulty dealing with women but took no action to remove him from the committee or otherwise to remedy the problem.\".<ref>United States District Court for the District of Hawai'i, 1994, Maivan Lam, Plaintiff-appellant, v. University of Hawai'i; Albert Simone, in His Capacity Aspresident of the University of Hawai'i; Andjeremy Harrison, in His Capacity As Deanof the Richardson School Oflaw, Defendants-appellees, 40 F.3d 1551 (9th Cir. 1994)</ref> There was clear intersectionality as Professor Lam was not only arguing regards to race but also how her gender affected her position.\n\nIn the case, ''Jefferies v. Harris County Community Action Association'', April 21, 1980, Dafro M. Jefferies claimed that her former employer failed to promote her to a higher position because of her race and sex. In 1967 she was employed by Harris County Community Action Association as a Secretary to the Director of Programs. She was later promoted to Personal Interviewer in 1970. Everything seemed to be moving in a positive direction for her. However, between 1971 and April 1974, Jefferies applied for promotions in various positions and departments without any luck. She realized that her employer was discriminating against her when two Field Representative positions opened. Jefferies immediately applied. However, the positions were already staffed by a white female and black male the same day that she was told about the vacant position. The company had purposefully told her about the open positions knowing that they were already filled by other staff members. After several complaints to the company, on April 23, 1974 Jefferies was placed on probation. In June 1974, she was terminated from the job because she had called the company out for discriminating against her because of her race and sex.

Characteristics such as race, age, and sex, may affect an individual in extremely different ways, in such simple cases as varying geography, socioeconomic status, or simply throughout time. Other scholars such as Kimberle Crenshaw's ''Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color'' are credited with expanding Collins' work.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|date=1991|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color |journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1241\u20131299|doi=10.2307/1229039|jstor=1229039|citeseerx=10.1.1.695.5934}}</ref> The matrix of domination is a way for people to acknowledge their privileges in society.

This is a problem that can be seen in the law as well when it comes to discrimination because the courts fail to view discrimination as an overarching umbrella of intersectionality.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cousins|first1=Oswald B.|title=The Judicial Approach to Intersectional Discrimination: Significant Decisions from a Defense Perspective|date=November 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA way in which the matrix of domination works with regards to privilege can be if two people all have the same classification, except one person has an education and one does not have as high of an education. Their gender, race, sexuality, educational attainment all intersect to identify who they are. However, compared to other people one classification can point out privilege and, in turn, open more opportunities for one individual over the other.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOne of the main aspects of the matrix of domination is the fact that one may be privileged in one area, yet they can be oppressed in a different aspect of their identity. Some people believe that racial discrimination is on its way to being eradicated from the United States when they look as people like Colin Powell, a very successful, African-American, middle-aged man. Although Powell obtains the characteristics of a person that may not face oppression (upper-class, middle-aged, male), he is still discriminated against because of his race. This shows one of the key components of the matrix of domination; the idea that one cannot look at the individual facets of someone's identity, but rather that they are all interconnected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rampages.us/oliviapryor/tag/matrix-of-domination/|title=matrix of domination {{!}} A so-sociologist|website=rampages.us|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref>\n\n== Matrix of domination compared to intersectionality ==\n\n=== Historical background on the matrix of domination ===\nIn Collins\u2019 ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment'', she first describes the concept of matrix thinking within the context of how black women in America encounter institutional discrimination based upon their race and gender.<ref name=\":02\">Collins, Patricia Hill. (2000) ''Black Feminist Thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment''. New York, Routledge.</ref> A prominent example of this in the 1990s was racial segregation, especially as it related to housing, education, and employment. At the time, there was very little encouraged interaction between whites and blacks in these common sectors of society. Collins argues that this demonstrates how being black and female in America continues to perpetuate certain common experiences for African-American women. As such, African-American women live in a different world than those who are not black and female.<ref name=\":02\" /> Collins notes how this shared social struggle can actually result in the formation of a group-based collective effort, citing how the high concentration of African-American women in the domestic labor sector in combination with racial segregation in housing and schooling contributed directly to the organization of the black feminist movement.<ref name=\":02\" /> The collective wisdom shared by black women that held these specific experiences constituted a distinct viewpoint for African-American women concerning correlations between their race and gender and the resulting economic consequences.\n\nMoolman points out the main issue concerning matrix thinking is how one accounts for the power dynamics between varying identifying categories that are ingrained in both oppression and domination instead of the traditional approach, reducing experiences to a single identity.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Rethinking 'masculinities in transition' in South Africa considering the 'intersectionality' of race, class, and sexuality with gender|journal = African Identities|volume = 11|pages = 93\u2013105|last=Moolman|first=Benita|date=2013|doi=10.1080/14725843.2013.775843}}</ref> For instance, black women's experiences with society are used to illustrate how even though white scholars have attempted to use intersectionality in their research, they may still be inclined to default towards single-identity thinking that often fails to address all aspects of black women's experiences, thus ignoring the organization the matrix objectively offers.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281204860|title=Pursuing Intersectionality, Unsettling Dominant Imaginaries|last=May|first=Vivian|date=2015-01-01|isbn=9780415808408}}</ref>\n\nThe matrix of domination in the colonial era and white society has also been carefully examined. The societal hierarchy determined by race and implemented under apartheid locates different racial populations in regards to their privilege, with African Americans usually at the bottom of the ladder. Dhamoon argues that on a global scale, the spot occupied by African Americans in such context is interchangeable with indigenous populations, as marginalized peoples are systematically working both within and across a matrix of interrelated axes of \"penalty and privilege\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.feralfeminisms.com/rita-dhamoon/|title=A FEMINIST APPROACH TO DECOLONIZING ANTI-RACISM: RETHINKING TRANSNATIONALISM, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND SETTLER COLONIALISM|website=feralfeminisms.com|access-date=2018-03-31}}</ref> The interconnectivity of different identities in regards to power in racial structures in post-colonial era societies help illustrate what changes make a difference. The framework setup of the matrix of domination connects its origin theory and thought to existing struggles in the political and social spheres of society. A closer look at both specific and broader aspects of matrix thought will shed more light on the inner-workings and mechanisms that determine how different relationship dynamics influence matrix categorizations.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMay cites that an important implication that matrix thinking inspires is that it directly goes against what is often described as the socially inclusive \u2018add and stir\u2019 approach.<ref name=\":12\" /> This is often used when describing the addition of one or more identity group to existing epistemological approaches, political strategies or research methodologies. This accounts for the proper weighing of power dynamics and their impact on different groups of people. Intersectionality centers power in a multi-pronged way as shifting across different sites and scales at the same time. Therefore, it is not neutral but evolved out of histories of struggle that pursue multidimensional forms of justice.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Historical background on intersectionality ===\n[[Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw|Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw]], the founder of the term [[intersectionality]], brought national and scholarly credential to the term through the paper ''Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics'' in The University of Chicago Legal Forum.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|date=|title=Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&context=uclf|journal=Chicago Unbound|volume=|pages=139\u2013167|via=}}</ref> In the paper, she uses intersectionality to reveal how feminist movements and antiracist movements exclude women of color.  Focusing on the experiences of Black women, she dissects several court cases, influential pieces of literature, personal experiences, and doctrinal manifestations as evidence for the way Black women are oppressed through many different experiences, systems and groups.\n\nThough the specifics differ, the basic argument is the same: Black women are oppressed in a multitude of situations because people are unable to see how their identities intersect and influence each other. Feminism has been crafted for white middle-class women, only considering problems that affect this group of people. Unfortunately, this only captures a small facet of the oppression women face. By catering to the most privileged women and addressing only the problems they face, feminism alienates women of color and lower-class women by refusing to accept the way other forms of oppression feed into the sexism they face. Not only does feminism completely disregard the experiences of women of color, it also solidifies the connection between womanhood and whiteness when feminists speak for \"all women\".<ref name=\":6\" /> (Crenshaw:154) Oppression cannot be detangled or separated easily in the same way identities cannot be separated easily. It is impossible to address the problem of sexism without addressing racism, as many women experience both racism and sexism. This theory can also be applied to the antiracist movement, which rarely addresses the problem of sexism, even though it is thoroughly intertwined with the problem of racism. Feminism remains white, and antiracism remains male. In essence, any theory that tries to measure the extent and manner of oppression Black women face will be wholly incorrect without using intersectionality.\n\nPatricia Hill Collins wrote a book entitled ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment'', which articulated \"Black Feminist Thought\" in relation to  intersectionality with a focus on the plight of Black women in face of the world, the white feminist movement, and the male antiracism movement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment|last=Collins|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Collins references Crenshaw's concept of intersectionality and relates it to the matrix of domination, \"The term matrix of domination describes this overall social organization within which intersecting oppressions originate, develop, and are contained.\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment|last=Collins|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=227}}</ref>\n\n=== Intersectionality and the matrix of domination ===\nBoth intersectionality and the matrix of domination help sociologists understand power relationships and systems of oppression in society.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gouws|first=Amanda|date=June 2017|title=Feminist intersectionality and the matrix of domination in South Africa|journal=Agenda|volume=31|pages=19\u201327|doi=10.1080/10130950.2017.1338871}}</ref> The matrix of domination looks at the overall organization of power in society while intersectionality is used to understand a specific social location of an identity using mutually constructing features of oppression.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe concept of intersectionality today is used to move away from one dimensional thinking in the matrix of domination approach by allowing for different power dynamics of different identity categories at the same time.

As a result, the field of social work is introducing intersectional approaches in their research and client interactions.

Several sociological studies on the welfare state take note of state-market relations while ignoring the salient roles held by other identities such as gender, race, class, language, and age, among others.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Politics, Gender, and Concepts|last=Mazur|first=Amy G.|last2=Goertz|first2=Gary|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521897761|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}</ref> Due to the nature of the welfare state, there has not been much regard for exploring the existence of multiple axes of oppression which has led to lineation of categories of race, class, and gender.<ref name=\":5\" /> In ''Politics, Gender, and Concepts'', Gary Goertz and Amy Mazur assert that literature about the welfare state should focus on the relationship between social positions and social policies, as well as provide a framework for investigations into the causal effects of class, gender, and race. As such, using the idea of a matrix of domination in these kinds of studies provides a basis for empirical research on the relationship between social positions and policies, and also, for a comparison between the outcomes of social policies on marginalized and privileged women.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Intersectionality of gender and class ==\n\n=== Benefits among class ===\n\nThe benefits that upper-class citizens receive from their employer are far different from that of working-class employees. This is due to the upper class taking jobs that give them a higher status or position, whereas the working class take jobs with lower status such as retail and blue-collar jobs.<ref name=\"Pacific Standard\">{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/economics/work-life-balance-benefits-low-wage-workers-employers-35733.|title=Work-Life Balance Benefits Low-Wage Workers, Employers|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}</ref> The most obvious benefit that differs between classes is the amount of money made. Upper-class workers receive significantly more pay than the working class, and while the upper class receive salaries, the lower class typically receive their pay based off hourly wages.<ref name=\"Pacific Standard\"/> Moreover, the chance of getting a raise is greater for the higher-ups. More benefits that the upper class enjoy over the working class are vacation time, flexible hours, retirement savings, and greater coverage of healthcare and insurance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://workingclassstudies.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/who-is-working-class/|title=Who is working class?|date=2008-07-28|work=Working-Class Perspectives|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Benefits among gender ===\n\nWhen it comes to workplace benefits such as health insurance coverage, pensions, sick leave, and disability plans, there are gender differences in whether or not these benefits are offered. Women are less likely to be offered pensions, health coverage and disability plans. In fact, high poverty rates among elderly women have been linked to lack of pension coverage. Additionally, many female heads of household remain on welfare because they cannot find jobs with adequate health insurance coverage. When it comes to union contracts, men are also twice as likely to be covered.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.3386/w4265 |title=Gender Gaps in Benefits Coverage |last=Currie |first=Janet |date=January 1993 |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 4265 }}</ref> This gender gap in benefits coverage may be due to the fact that women tend to have higher medical expenditures than males of the same age. As a result, some of the observed gap in wages between males and females in the United States could be the result of employers compensating for the higher cost of employer-sponsored health insurance. This further perpetuates gender discrimination because it means that firms who offer ESI (Employer Sponsored Insurance) will prefer to hire males. Another effect of women generally having greater healthcare expenses than men is that they are likely to place a higher value on insurance and be more inclined to pass up jobs for insurance-related reasons. This lowers the probability of obtaining jobs that pay higher wages directly and decrease a woman's bargaining power with her current employer. Indeed, health insurance has a larger (negative) effect on the job mobility of women, which they attribute to women's elevated healthcare expenses.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-01-01|title=Employer-sponsored health insurance and the gender wage gap |journal=Journal of Health Economics|language=en|volume=45|pages=103\u2013114|doi=10.1016/j.jhealeco.2015.09.008|pmid=26614691 |issn=0167-6296|last1=Cowan |first1=Benjamin |last2=Schwab |first2=Benjamin }}</ref>\n\n=== Wage gap among class ===\n\nIn the United States there is an unequal distribution of income between social classes for multiple reasons. Level of education has a great influence on average salaries. The higher the socioeconomic status (SES) of an individual the more likely they are to graduate from high school and potentially obtain a college degree, which in return increases their chances of a larger salary. The average salary of an individual with a high school diploma is about $35,000, but increases to about $60,000 by obtaining a bachelor's degree after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smartasset.com/retirement/the-average-salary-by-education-level|title=The Average Salary by Education Level - SmartAsset|website=SmartAsset|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref> The gap in salary increases with each additional level of education received. Those in the lower class face more obstacles and have less opportunities to pursue additional education due to their lack of resources. The wage gap is even larger for individuals affected by poverty and racial barriers. Whites have a median income of about $71,000 while blacks have a median income of about $43,000.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/1-demographic-trends-and-economic-well-being/|title=1.

Individuals in poverty already face a disadvantage in obtaining the same level of income as their upper class coworkers, but when also affected by racial barriers the chances of reaching the same income are even fewer.\n\n=== Wage gap among gender ===\n\nThere is definitely intersectionality and inequality with women and men when it comes to wage gaps. Careers that pay well are often male dominated, and do not tolerate women and their personal needs. There has been a stable \"pay gap\" between men and women which has remained between 10-20% difference in their average earnings. (Women, careers and work life preferences).  When discussing wage gaps between genders, scientists takes into account two questions, the first being \"is there differential access jobs on the basis of gender?\" and the second being, \"is women\u2019s work perceived to have less value than comparable work done by men?\".  When women begin to increase their numbers in certain job positions the status or value of the job decreases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hakim|first=Catherine|date=18 January 2017|title=Women, careers, and work-life preferences|journal= British Journal of Guidance & Counselling|volume=34|issue=3|pages=279\u2013294|doi=10.1080/03069880600769118|citeseerx=10.1.1.463.726}}</ref> Conceptualizing intersectionality through class, gender and race then identifying the barriers that create inequality in Work organizations is found in the idea of \"inequality regimes\".

In television and popular culture, those who fall into the lower class are often portrayed differently based on if they are a woman or a man. If they are a woman, they often are portrayed as being more intelligent and responsible than their husbands, almost acting as their mothers.<ref name=\":1\"/> The male head of the household is typically portrayed as being less intelligent, with some redeeming qualities, but typically is not respected.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/socialclass.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television - Social Class and Television|website=www.museum.tv|access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref> Together they can be shown in a light that makes them seem lazy or dishonest.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woods|first=Taniesha|date=October 25, 2004|title=The Development of Stereotypes About the Rich and Poor: Age, Race, and Family Income Differences in Beliefs|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/108157/Stereotype%20Development.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=34|pages=|via=}}</ref> The upper class however, does not face these same issues with representation in the media. The man of the household takes on stereotypical male qualities, while the woman takes on stereotypical female qualities. The children in this upper class scenario are what provides entertainment value, rather than focusing on the unintelligent and unorganized adults as in the lower class model.<ref name=\":1\" /> Overall, in the upper-class family unit, they are portrayed as organized and put together, while the lower class model are portrayed as lazy and unorganized.\n\n=== Representation among gender ===\n\nIn American society and many other societies around the world, being a largely represented group in a position of power means that one has succeeded in life. Whether one is a manager of a fast food restaurant or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, authority is power and power is advantage. But just like the widespread power struggle, there is a widespread equality struggle. One of the largest workplace and societal inequalities is the inequality between genders. A prime example of this is the wage gap. Women in 2016 earned, on average, 82 cents to a man's dollar. This unequal pay is part of the reason that many women are the ones to leave the workforce when it is determined that a stay-at-home parent is required; if women are contributing less to the household income, it will make less of an impact if they quit their jobs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/04/pf/equal-pay-day-gender-pay-gap/index.html|title=5 things to know about the gender pay gap|last=Vasel|first=Kathryn|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref> Women are also not granted the same opportunities for employment as men. A clear example is the U.S. military. Women were banned from all combat roles until recently. In 2011, only 14 percent of the armed forces were female, and only 14 percent of officers were female.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/01/24/us/military-women-glance/index.html|title=By the numbers: Women in the U.S. military|author=CNN Staff|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref> Another example is the U.S. congress. In 2015, 80 percent of the Senate was male, and only 20 was female. This numbers were similar for the House, at 80.6 percent male and 19.4 percent female.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/05/the-new-congress-is-80-percent-white-80-percent-male-and-92-percent-christian/|title=The new Congress is 80 percent white, 80 percent male and 92 percent Christian|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=2015-01-05|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> The gender composition of the military and the government, along with the wage gap, shines a lights on the gender inequality experienced right here at home, but this inequality is more greatly felt abroad. Some countries place strict limitations on women, not allowing them to vote or work or even drive a car. While the U.S. is seen as a country of dreams and opportunity, is far easier to see this when compared to an even more unequal country. The United States has been trending toward gender equality in recent years, but it has a while to go.\n\n=== Research contributions ===\n\nAn article found in the November 1998 issue of ''Social Problems'' details the conflict involving racial domination by identifying the complexity African-Americans face.  In many cases, sociologists and laypersons alike are often limited in their approach to the problem.  Michelle Byng, in \"Mediating Discrimination: Oppression among African-American Muslim Women\"\u2014the 1998 article\u2014brings to focus new approaches to understanding discrimination, but also, she writes to illustrate the many overlooked opportunities in which the discriminated are able to empower themselves in certain situations.\n\n==Intersectionality in court cases==\nThere are countless numbers of court cases that examine intersectionality within the workforce that did not allow individuals to have equal opportunities because of their race, gender, and social class.\n\nThe case, ''DeGraffenreid vs. General Motors'', provides an example when the law does an injustice to those that face discrimination. Five black female production workers were laid off, and took it to court claiming that the company was violating [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] because, \"it perpetrated past discriminatory practices of not hiring Black females.\" The court looked at each of the categories, race and gender, separately therefore they missed the discrimination of a person being both African-American and female. \"It was argued, black women can expect little protection as long as approaches, such as that in DeGraffenreid, which completely obscure problems of intersectionality prevail.\"<ref>Cousins, Oswald B. (November 10, 2017). \"The Judicial Approach to Intersectional Discrimination: Significant Decisions from a Defense Perspective\".</ref>\n\nAnother case, ''Maivan Lam v. University of Hawai'i'', where intersectionality was the core reason behind the problem that emerged. Maivan Lam was not offered a job twice when she applied to be the Director of the Law School's Pacific Asian Legal Studies Program. Two times, the university was looking for a director and when the final offer came around, and she was the best candidate available, the university simply cancelled their search. In the first search, Professor Lam made it to the final round, but was not offered the job before the whole search was simply shut down. The second time, the position was offered to another candidate and the other candidate refused to accept, the search was simply cancelled without it being offered to Professor Lam. When Lam brought this situation up to the Dean, he suggested reopening the search so that male candidates who had not applied on time could submit their applications. It is stated, \"Early in the 1989-90 academic year, the new appointments committee reviewed applications for a commercial law position. At one meeting, a male committee member stated that the Law School should not have two women teaching commercial law. This comment was reported to the Dean, who said that he recognized that the professor had difficulty dealing with women but took no action to remove him from the committee or otherwise to remedy the problem.\".<ref>United States District Court for the District of Hawai'i, 1994, Maivan Lam, Plaintiff-appellant, v. University of Hawai'i; Albert Simone, in His Capacity Aspresident of the University of Hawai'i; Andjeremy Harrison, in His Capacity As Deanof the Richardson School Oflaw, Defendants-appellees, 40 F.3d 1551 (9th Cir. 1994)</ref> There was clear intersectionality as Professor Lam was not only arguing regards to race but also how her gender affected her position.\n\nIn the case, ''Jefferies v. Harris County Community Action Association'', April 21, 1980, Dafro M. Jefferies claimed that her former employer failed to promote her to a higher position because of her race and sex. In 1967 she was employed by Harris County Community Action Association as a Secretary to the Director of Programs. She was later promoted to Personal Interviewer in 1970. Everything seemed to be moving in a positive direction for her. However, between 1971 and April 1974, Jefferies applied for promotions in various positions and departments without any luck. She realized that her employer was discriminating against her when two Field Representative positions opened. Jefferies immediately applied. However, the positions were already staffed by a white female and black male the same day that she was told about the vacant position. The company had purposefully told her about the open positions knowing that they were already filled by other staff members. After several complaints to the company, on April 23, 1974 Jefferies was placed on probation. In June 1974, she was terminated from the job because she had called the company out for discriminating against her because of her race and sex. There was clear evidence of intersectionality in this case, she argued; She was not promoted to a higher position because she was both black and a female. However, the court ultimately disagreed with her, insofar as there existed zero concrete evidence to support her case.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/425/1208/1513479/ |title = Jeffries v.

The objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a \"raider\", to run into the opposing team's half of a court, tag out as many of their defenders as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders, and in a single breath. Points are scored tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are tagged or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle. Kabaddi is also known as Hututu, Do-Do and Ghidugudu.\n\nIt is popular in [[South Asia]] and other surrounding [[Asia]]n countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of [[ancient India]], the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century.

The game was said to have been popular among the [[Yadava]] people; an [[abhang]] by [[Tukaram]] stated that the god [[Krishna]] played the game in his youth, while the [[Mahabharata]] contains an account of [[Arjuna]] being able to sneak into hostile areas also take out enemies unscathed, which they are claiming that parallels the gameplay of kabaddi.\n\nThere are accounts of [[Gautama Buddha]] having played the game recreationally.{{Citation needed|date= December 2019}}\n\nDespite these conflicting claims, India has been credited with having helped to popularize kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first organized competitions occurring in the 1920s, their introduction to the programme of the [[National Games of India|Indian Olympic Games]] in 1938, the establishment of the All-India Kabaddi Federation in 1950, and it being played as a [[demonstration sport]] at the [[1951 Asian Games|inaugural 1951 Asian Games]] in [[New Delhi]].

Each has five supplementary players held in reserve (in other words, for substitution). The game is played with 20-minute halves with a 5-minute half break in which the teams exchange sides. During each play, known as a \"raid\", a player from the attacking side, known as the \"raider\", runs into the opposing team's side of the court and attempts to tag as many of the seven defending players as possible. For a raid to be eligible for points, the raider must cross the baulk line into the defending team's territory, and then return to their half of the field without being tackled. (If an attacker touches a defender and hasn't yet reached the baulk line, they don't need to reach the baulk line to score points and may return to their half of the court.)<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.prokabaddi.com/prokabaddi-rules | title= Pro Kabaddi Rules | website= prokabaddi.com| publisher= | date= | access-date= }}</ref> While raiding, the raider must loudly chant ''kabaddi'', confirming to referees that their raid is done on a single breath without inhaling. A 30-second limit is also enforced on each raid.<ref name=\"kabaddiikf\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"indianexpress-everything\" />\n\nA point is scored for each defender tagged. If the raider steps beyond the bonus line marked in the defending team's territory, they earn an additional point known as a bonus point. If the raider is successfully stopped (tackled), the opposite team earns a point instead. All players tagged are taken out of the game, but one is \"revived\" for each point a team scores from a subsequent tag or tackle. Bonus points do not revive players. Players who step out of the boundary are out. A raid where no points are scored by the raider is referred to as an \"empty raid\". By contrast, a play where the raider scores three or more points is referred to as a \"super raid\". If a team gets all seven players on the opposing team out at once (\"All Out\"), they earn two additional points and the players are placed back in the game.<ref name=\"kabaddiikf\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"indianexpress-everything\" />\n\nAdditional rules are used in the [[Pro Kabaddi League]]: if a team has two empty raids in a row, the next raider must score a point, because the next raid is a \"do-or-die\" raid. In this raid, the player must either get a point or be out. If the raider does not get a point then the opposite team will get a point and the raider will be declared out. Additionally when fewer than four players left on the field, tackles are worth 2 points (\"super tackle\").<ref name= \"kabaddiikf\">{{cite web|url=http://kabaddiikf.com/RULES_Regularikf.doc|title=Rules of Kabaddi|publisher=International Kabaddi Federation (IKF)|access-date=26 August 2014|url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070523/http://kabaddiikf.com/RULES_Regularikf.doc|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/kabaddi-world-cup-2016-a-handy-guide-to-the-format-rules-and-how-the-sport-works-3034132.html|title=Kabaddi World Cup 2016: A handy guide to the format, rules and how the sport works|date=2016-10-05|work=Firstpost|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/kabaddi/story/_/id/20169474/all-need-know-pro-kabaddi-league-2017|title=Kabaddi 101: Raid, defend, revive, repeat|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref><ref name=\"indianexpress-everything\">{{Cite news |url= http://indianexpress.com/article/blogs/sports-blogs/everything-you-need-to-know-about-kabaddi/|title=Everything you need to know about Kabaddi|date=2016-01-30|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Circle style===\n[[File:Kabaddi Match (Bhimber).jpg|thumb|right|A circle kabaddi match being played in [[Bhimber]]]]\nThere are four major forms of Indian kabaddi recognised by the amateur federation. In Sanjeevani kabaddi, one player is revived against one player of the opposite team who is out. The game is played over 40 minutes with a five-minute break between halves. There are seven players on each side and the team that outs all the players on the opponent's side scores four extra points. In Gaminee style, seven players play on each side and a player put out has to remain out until all his team members are out. The team that is successful in outing all the players of the opponent's side secures a point. The game continues until five or seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration. Amar style resembles the Sanjeevani form in the time frame rule, but a player who is declared out stays inside the court while play continues.

Points are scored tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider.

The game was said to have been popular among the [[Yadava]] people; an [[abhang]] by [[Tukaram]] stated that the god [[Krishna]] played the game in his youth, while the [[Mahabharata]] contains an account of [[Arjuna]] being able to sneak into hostile areas also take out enemies unscathed, which they are claiming that parallels the gameplay of kabaddi.\n\nThere are accounts of [[Gautama Buddha]] having played the game recreationally.{{Citation needed|date= December 2019}}\n\nDespite these conflicting claims, India has been credited with having helped to popularize kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first organized competitions occurring in the 1920s, their introduction to the programme of the [[National Games of India|Indian Olympic Games]] in 1938, the establishment of the All-India Kabaddi Federation in 1950, and it being played as a [[demonstration sport]] at the [[1951 Asian Games|inaugural 1951 Asian Games]] in [[New Delhi]].

Each has five supplementary players held in reserve (in other words, for substitution). The game is played with 20-minute halves with a 5-minute half break in which the teams exchange sides. During each play, known as a \"raid\", a player from the attacking side, known as the \"raider\", runs into the opposing team's side of the court and attempts to tag as many of the seven defending players as possible. For a raid to be eligible for points, the raider must cross the baulk line into the defending team's territory, and then return to their half of the field without being tackled. (If an attacker touches a defender and hasn't yet reached the baulk line, they don't need to reach the baulk line to score points and may return to their half of the court.)<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.prokabaddi.com/prokabaddi-rules | title= Pro Kabaddi Rules | website= prokabaddi.com| publisher= | date= | access-date= }}</ref> While raiding, the raider must loudly chant ''kabaddi'', confirming to referees that their raid is done on a single breath without inhaling. A 30-second limit is also enforced on each raid.<ref name=\"kabaddiikf\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"indianexpress-everything\" />\n\nA point is scored for each defender tagged. If the raider steps beyond the bonus line marked in the defending team's territory, they earn an additional point known as a bonus point. If the raider is successfully stopped (tackled), the opposite team earns a point instead. All players tagged are taken out of the game, but one is \"revived\" for each point a team scores from a subsequent tag or tackle. Bonus points do not revive players. Players who step out of the boundary are out. A raid where no points are scored by the raider is referred to as an \"empty raid\". By contrast, a play where the raider scores three or more points is referred to as a \"super raid\". If a team gets all seven players on the opposing team out at once (\"All Out\"), they earn two additional points and the players are placed back in the game.<ref name=\"kabaddiikf\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"indianexpress-everything\" />\n\nAdditional rules are used in the [[Pro Kabaddi League]]: if a team has two empty raids in a row, the next raider must score a point, because the next raid is a \"do-or-die\" raid. In this raid, the player must either get a point or be out. If the raider does not get a point then the opposite team will get a point and the raider will be declared out. Additionally when fewer than four players left on the field, tackles are worth 2 points (\"super tackle\").<ref name= \"kabaddiikf\">{{cite web|url=http://kabaddiikf.com/RULES_Regularikf.doc|title=Rules of Kabaddi|publisher=International Kabaddi Federation (IKF)|access-date=26 August 2014|url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070523/http://kabaddiikf.com/RULES_Regularikf.doc|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/kabaddi-world-cup-2016-a-handy-guide-to-the-format-rules-and-how-the-sport-works-3034132.html|title=Kabaddi World Cup 2016: A handy guide to the format, rules and how the sport works|date=2016-10-05|work=Firstpost|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/kabaddi/story/_/id/20169474/all-need-know-pro-kabaddi-league-2017|title=Kabaddi 101: Raid, defend, revive, repeat|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref><ref name=\"indianexpress-everything\">{{Cite news |url= http://indianexpress.com/article/blogs/sports-blogs/everything-you-need-to-know-about-kabaddi/|title=Everything you need to know about Kabaddi|date=2016-01-30|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Circle style===\n[[File:Kabaddi Match (Bhimber).jpg|thumb|right|A circle kabaddi match being played in [[Bhimber]]]]\nThere are four major forms of Indian kabaddi recognised by the amateur federation. In Sanjeevani kabaddi, one player is revived against one player of the opposite team who is out. The game is played over 40 minutes with a five-minute break between halves. There are seven players on each side and the team that outs all the players on the opponent's side scores four extra points. In Gaminee style, seven players play on each side and a player put out has to remain out until all his team members are out. The team that is successful in outing all the players of the opponent's side secures a point. The game continues until five or seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration. Amar style resembles the Sanjeevani form in the time frame rule, but a player who is declared out stays inside the court while play continues.
